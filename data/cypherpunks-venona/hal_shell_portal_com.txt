Ana.. by Hal As you said, no one. It would be pretty much a park in cyberspace. If
however, it remained in the hands of a small number of people, it would
be controlled by them ("their house").

Excerpts from internet.cypherpunks: 15-May-96 Re:  SEVERE undercapacity,
.. by Hal Has anyone considered how the online copyright legislation being
considered in the House and the Senate may affect anonymous remailers?
There are some interesting provisions, such as requiring the provider of
a service or a network to take steps including "removing, disabling, or
blocking access to the material claimed to be infringing."
Also, each ISP would have to register an agent with the U.S. Copyright
Office to accept service, etc.
By my reading, anonymous remailers don't follow into the "local
exchange, trunk line, or backbone" provisions of the law.
The legislation likely will move through Congress largely intact -- at
least that's the reading I got from the House judiciary subcommittee
