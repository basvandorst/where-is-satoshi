Hi,
  I'm fairly new here and not sure if this topic has come up before, but
I'll offer it anyway:
 In using encrypted communications, how does one avoid the problem of
calling attention to the message BECAUSE it is encrypted? "If he went to
the trouble of coding it, there MUST be something in there!!" Granted that
if everyone begins encrypting, this problem will vanish... are there
practical solutions in the meantime? (eg, Codes that look like plaintext?)

I'm not saying that the phony email-account scheme has a lot of merit,
but it could surely be implemented: simply pay by money order from your
local Christys each month, and, of course, order the initial service from
a mail drop or something. I actually think the most reliable privacy methods
are low-tech (e.g., pay for things w/ cash instead of checks or credit cards)
but they involve sacrificing some of the convenience we may be accustomed
to. Personally, I get my access free, and I wouldn't want to pony up the
bucks to pay for a duplicate account...

Are Boston area folks interested in another get together? The last one I
went to (early April) was a blast...

The weekend after the 10th (the 17th) would also be better for me. Has
Derek or anybody else still got the email addresses of the people who
attended last time?

....but a smart person can ensure that you can't track him down FARTHER
than the machine he forged it from (without extraordinary aid, like
access to the site's sendmail logs).
  Actually, forging mail at the machine you're on en route to the remailer
protects you against:
1) Anyone who can snoop the message headers on the way to the remailer
("Tra la la. Let's keep a little list of everyone using those remailers...")
2) A corrupt remailer operator.
  I'm assuming you send from a fairly large organization. Then even though
they can find out which machine originated the message, one can't
determine which of the users (and there may be more than 100) originated the
message. Plausible deniability.

There seem to be some problems with the above scheme:
1) Suppose I buy a legal copy of some software and give it to a friend,
along with the information he needs to run it. To prove piracy, someone
would have to check the files on his/her hard disk. Surely this is an
invasion of privacy no cypherpunk would tolerate.
2) Suppose that somehow a pirated copy of the software was discovered,
and traced back to me. This still does not provide any kind of case
against me, since it is not clear whether or not I gave the information
away (it could have been stolen off my hard drive while at a repair shop,
or by a house guest, or...). To argue otherwise implies making the
software owners liable if the software sold to them is pirated.
  Of course, these are legal, not technical objections to your scheme.

Two problems:
1) Aren't telnets logged, at least at the site you telnet to? If I "telnet
xxxx smtp", doesn't the site I telnet to have it in a log? I can't control
that, and that could identify me.
2) Sendmail (at least on our system) drops mail into a queue owned by root,
and inaccessible to anyone else. So without root privs your sendmail may
not function. (I know because I've tried).
I'm no UNIX guru, just a hacker, so if someone knows more by all means
correct me.
