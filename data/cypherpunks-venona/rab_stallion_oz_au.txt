This thread touches a memory of mine from 18 years ago when I was at
university.  While studying for a mathematics exam I became sidetracked
by one of Fermat's Theorems (Last? or Little?) and am convinced to this
day that I came up with an algorithm for determining if a number was
prime by a "simple" combination of shifts and logical operations.  The
beast part was that the amount of calculation was linearly related to
the number of bits in the binary representation of the number.
I only ever spent a couple of hours on it, working through it on paper,
and after the exams were finished and I went back to it I could not find
the original notes and I could not remember exactly what I had done.
However it seems like someone else has...

Look on the bright side: You will probably never know what hit you :-)

This kind of talk makes me sick.  For a start universal healthcare is
totally unaffordable, when there is little or no cost the end-user over
use of the services provided are inevitable, just look at Medicare here
in Australia.  Social security above certain levels leave recipients
unmotivated to take responsibility for their own lives and is a bad
example to their children, who will probably number largely among those
teenagers who do turn to crime.
Robert, unrepentant dry.

@_subject: RE: Bell vs. Woodward--justice? 
Here in Australia the media has been giving this trial regular coverage
with the spin "Innocent English Person Wrongly Found Guilty by US Jury".
The coverage led me to believe that despite scientific evidence to  the
contrary the jury found Woodward guilty.  One other point from the
coverage was that Woodward represented herself for at least some part of
the trial, did Jim Bell do this too?
Obviously Tim you have been exposed to very different media coverage.
