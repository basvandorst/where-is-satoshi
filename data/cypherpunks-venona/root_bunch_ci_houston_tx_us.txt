I guess the statement about this being an "active" list was a little understated - however it did not mention anything about being used as a personal forum for petty bickering.  I have a slow link (see 9600bps) to the internet and have been watching messages steadily trickle in for the past two or three hours concerning Rush and a "wager" between two people - I notice that they copy the other interested party as if they would not receive it via the list like EVERYONE ELSE DOES!
Maybe I'm opening myself up for a flame - I might even deserve it if this discussion in fact does have something to do with cryptography and or related bits of information.  If it does - please let me know (private mail is fine - you can even copy the list if you feel everyone deserves to see me ripped to shreds).
My 2 cents,
No, not like Bundy!
