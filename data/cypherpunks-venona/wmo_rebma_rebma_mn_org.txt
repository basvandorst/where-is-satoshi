@_subject: Another remailer 
I've installed Eric's anonymous remailer scripts at remailer
Rebma is my home machine...  It's not right on the Internet, but it is a
Telebit connection away.  Feel free to use it as you see fit.  I don't
have Hal's PGP additions, but I am interested in running them.
Hal's messages said he hoped more people put up remailers so that they could be
chained together.  Sounded good to me.

@_subject: Apology 
Oops.  Sorry about sending my response to Eric's survey to the entire
list.  Honestly, I know better, but I think that was the first time that
I've used mh's repl, and I didn't check the cc.  Oops.
Anyway, I've had a couple queries on Eric's remailer.  Hal Finney,
just so you know, I've not heard responses from you to a couple letters,
and neither has at least one other person.  We're interested in your code
for the Encrypted: part of the remailer.

@_subject: Some hacked scripts for the remailers 
Here's a couple of real rough Bourne shell scripts to get some mail
to go to both Hal's and my remailers.  Not too helpful if you don't
have a unix machine around--sorry.  Nothing fancy, but it'll keep the
mental confusion down when trying to put a message together.
First is twohop...
------ Cut here ------
# Two hop anonymous remailer  hal's first, then rebma ...
if [ $# != 2 ]
then # if the "remailing" and "remailer" names look odd--well, that's what hal's
# and my respective keys for the remailers are named...
encap $message $dest remailer $t1
encap $t1 remailer remailing $t2
elm hal < $t2
rm -f $t1 $t2
----- Cut here -----
twohop calls encap twice.  Encap is a more general and useful script.
------ Cut here ------
# usage: encap message-file destination remailer resultfile
if [ $# != 4 ]
echo :: > $t1
echo Request-Remailing-To: $dest >> $t1
echo "" >> $t1
cat $mfile >> $t1
pgp -ea $t1 $remailer
echo :: > $t2
echo Encrypted: PGP >> $t2
echo "" >> $t2
cat $t1.asc >> $t2
mv $t2 $result
rm -f $t1
---- Cut here -----
These seem to work for me...  At least, a couple messages now have gotten
back to me from them.  They helped me get a couple problems out of
the remailer.

@_subject: Re: anonymous remailer 
(Karl's remailer announcement, key, and script elided.  Thanks, Karl -- the
more the merrier!  And the more, the safer, I would think.)
I've got a couple really trivial comments.  Karl, your script called "mail"
to deliver the file.  Looks like it works on your machine, but on mine,
"mail" called /bin/mail, which seemed to put an "Apparently-To: xxx" header
in the message, and messed things up.  If any of you have a problem with
Karl's script, you might check that.  I used elm to send the file, but I
would think /bin/mailx or /bin/Mail (depending on what Unix you're using)
would work as well.
Also, I'm hoping one of you who is proficient in perl will rewrite the
darn thing.  It needs generalizing, and perl's just the language for
the job...  As a Bourne shell script, it looks ugly, especially with all
those temporary files all over the place.

@_subject: Remailer problem at rebma fixed 
My apologies to those who have used PGP with the remailer at rebma
over the past week.  I upgraded to pgp2.1, and I failed to notice
that the PGPPASS environment variable has given way to the -z password
option.  Users of Hal's remailer scripts take notice.
I ran the mail through that had failed, so there might be duplicates
of messages sent out, since some people might have resent the message
if they didn't see it go by (that is, if they sent it to something where
they'd see the result, such as the cypherpunks list.)
Sorry for the inconvenience.

@_subject: Remailer at rebma.mn.org 
My apologies to anyone who has tried to use the anonymous remailer at
rebma.mn.org in the past several weeks.  I upgraded the system, and forgot,
apparently, to test out the remailer.  No one reported that the remailer
wasn't working, and it didn't occur to me to test it until today.  I imagine that people who weren't successful were experimenters who chalked
up the failure to something they'd done wrong.
It's working again, now.
Here's the PGP key.

@_subject: REMAILER: really anon? 
A little background on my remailer...  My machine is connected to the net
at large via UUCP...  And I only have one phone line at home, which me and
the family share with the computer.  So it only polls out for mail when
we're asleep (22:30 CDT - 7:30 CDT).  And, I'll admit, when the weather gets
ugly enough here in Minnesota, the machine gets powered down to keep the
place cooler.
That's the disadvantage of the remailer at rebma.  The advantage is that since
I own the machine, the remailer will stay in operation, period.  (I think
my service provider does have a clause in the agreement that mentions that
use that prevents other users from getting service will not be tolerated,
but that's it.)
So, if you're looking for fast turnaround time, remailer is not
for you.  If a long delay can be used as an advantage, more power to you.

@_subject: Remailer comments 
While checking for problems in the rebma remailer's logs, I noticed the
Some folks have sent PGP encrypted test messages without including the
Encrypted: PGP
text, or the Encrypted: header.
Also, some folks have tried some variations on the Request-Remailing-To: line, such as just To:, putting the :: and the Request- line together, etc.
Those things won't work, and you'll get nothing back.  Anyone who has tried
to use the remailer here and has failed, send me a note and I'll send
you the instructions.  Or, I think Karl (Karl Barrus )
has a complete set of information and scripts to help out.
Karl, you might consider including a terse list of instructions with your regular remailer mailing.
(Oh, to avoid starting the remailer-operator-responsibilities-discussion,
I'll state my policy on logs on this machine.  I glance at 'em to make
sure that there aren't any errors in the scripts, and then I remove 'em.
If you're going to be an asshole via my remailer, I'd appreciate it if
you used PGP so that there's no clear text here, so that I don't have to
ever revise this simple policy.)

@_subject: Remailer bug... 
I just noticed a potential problem with the current Cypherpunks remailers.
If someone uses the -m option when they encrypt for the remailer, the
pgp session will hang, waiting for input to the "For your eyes only.   Display now? (Y/n)?" message.
(Yeah, if you're wondering, someone did this to the remailer on Rebma.)

@_subject: Re: Breaking DES 
Whenever Perry Metzger defends an opinion of his well, somebody whines.
Whenever Perry Metzger disagrees with someone's arguments, someone else
crys "unfair! He's using his WITS on me!"
Whenever Perry Metzger has to stop and demonstrate something as simple as
arithmetic to end an argument, someone cries "foul! sarcasm!  Hey, he's not
playing nice!"
Y'all need to develop slightly thicker skins.  Perry's efforts could serve to raise the thought level of other posters to this list, if they'd stop reacting
to each prod with an irritated swipe back at the prodder.
I like the strife on this list. Happy people getting along famously are dull.
(Someone could consider adding to the cypherpunk philosophy: Cypherpunks write
code, and cypherpunks are irritable.)

@_subject: Remailer traffic 
To whoever is sending the piles of messages through my remailer that contain
the "Do-Inject:" header line:
You might as well leave the remailer at rebma.mn.org out of whatever it is
you are doing.  Your mail is not making it through.  I'm not directly on
the Internet.  If your goal is to supply bogus traffic to make traffic analysis
impractical, I applaud your thinking, but not your implementation. You're filling up my disk drive, dude.

@_subject: Re: Server Incompatibilities? 
As Hal mentions in another note, this should be fixed, now.  I believe I
changed my mail config a couple months ago and did not test the remailer.
It took a while for anyone (anyone == Hal) to notice and bug me about it.
Sorry for any inconvenience.

@_subject: Zimmerman's use of PGP 
As anyone who has ever sent an encrypted "Really neat program, Phil!" message
to Phillip Zimmerman knows, he doesn't run PGP where he reads his mail.
He has to download messages to decrypt on a local machine.
All of the cute elm/vi/emacs/mh/pine scripts you wanna post won't help
(P.S.  Back when he didn't get so much mail, if you'd done the above, you'd        get a response in a couple weeks, telling you this.  He mentioned that
       he saw the irony of the situation -- that the inventor of PGP couldn't
       make convenient use of it.)

@_subject: PGP, remailer@rebma.mn.org 
The remailer at rebma.mn.org was not using pgp 2.6, and it was having
trouble with messages that used the newer versions.  (I think it was
running 2.3.)
Anyway, I fixed it, but I imagine there's been some traffic that didn't
get remailed.  Sorry.
