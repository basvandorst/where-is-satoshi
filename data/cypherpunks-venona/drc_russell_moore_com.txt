I, too, have only skimmed the code briefly.
[Lots of good stuff deleted]
What isn't clear to me is how much entropy they are assigning to these
sources.  Certainly if they manage to get at least 128 bits of entropy
then it doesn't matter how many non-random bits they mix into the hash.
I think they are simply throwing everything but the kitchen sink in,
and assuming that the overall result will be a sufficient number of
bits of entropy.  But it would be nice to at least see a few comments
on how many bits they expect each individual source to provide.
I also noticed that they use $HOME/.pgp/randseed.bin under unix, but
they don't bother with %PGPPATH%\RANDSEED.BIN on PCs.  I've sent Jeff
a private message about this.

I thought about this a bit, but I don't think that reading randseed.bin
counts as "mucking around with" the "PGP setup."
PGP launders randseed.bin before saving it for just this reason, so that
reading it won't reveal information on the user's session keys.
And the Netscape folks have published the source code which shows that
they only read the file and hash it with MD5.  That the contents of
randseed.bin have been mixed into an MD5 hash with a bunch of other
things can hardly be called a security hole, in my estimation.

If the payer doesn't add a blinding factor, then the only blinding factor
is the one known to the payee.  The payee could reveal this blinding factor
to the bank, destroying the payer's anonymity.
