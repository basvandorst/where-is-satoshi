TIS provides a full line of security products and
                    services including: Gauntlet firewalls to protect
                    network connections; Gauntlet Global Virtual Private
                    Networks to secure electronic communications                     Stalker misuse detection solutions to ensure the
                    integrity of servers which, when used in conjunction
                    with Network Associates' CyberCop, extends this level                     protection to networks; and TIS Consulting and                     services to facilitate a company's network running
                    smoothly.
                    TIS' RecoverKey encryption technology provides                     scalable, user-controlled key recovery, and has been
                    implemented by multinational organizations for their
                    global networks. TIS is a founding member of the Key
                    Recovery Alliance, an organization of over 60
                    international companies working together to facilitate
                    the worldwide commercial use of strong encryption.
                    "This announcement represents a fundamental shift in                     way large customers will implement security                     said Bill Larson, chairman and CEO of Network
                    Associates. "Network Associates is the first company                     deliver this caliber of technology and this breadth of
                    security products. The ability to tie all of these
                    components together in a centralized management
                    environment is critical to customer success, and                     Associates is the only company to combine security                     industry-leading network management capabilities."
Well I guess this returns Network Associates to the Key Recovery Alliance.  I wonder what the PGP division thinks about the new member of the family being the founding member of the KRA?

The Navy's Onion Routing project ( actual makes reference to anonymous cell phone networks by using encrypted proxies (Onions).  The current implementation is IP based, but the briefing documents refer to any public networks including pager and cell networks.
