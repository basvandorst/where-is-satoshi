@_subject: PGP Interoperability? 
Can anyone out there vouch for the interoperability of PGP 2.6 ui with versions of PGP available in USA from MIT & Viacrypt.
What about the legal issue ?
Is it legal for a US citizen to encrypt or check signatures with a 2.6ui public key ?
Would sending a public key out of the US be reagarded as export by ITAR?
