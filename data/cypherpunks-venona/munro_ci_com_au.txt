John Pettitt presents us with C code possibily matching the algorithm
(see the end of this email).
I imagine that John Pettitt may have written:
Well I spent 30 seconds on it. Do we get to start with known plain text?
This is the usual assumption these days. It so hopeless I imagine more
experienced cryptographers won't even bother replying.
DON'T USE THIS CODE.
It has a long cycle: (the product of all the c[i]) * 64
It can be broken into 64 parts and each part attacked separately.
Each part is the outputs with offset i modulo 64. Part i has a cycle
of c[i]. (Its irrelevant that the b[i] are prime, helps if they are
coprime to c[i].) There is no feedback between parts.
Each part looks like a LCM PRNG to me. The cryptanalysis of these was
done decades ago by Knuth. From memory the key can be deduced in a
known plain text attack with knownledge of about the same amount of
plain text as there is unknown key (initial state). (under 1K bytes).
Even without known plain text I suspect it would not survive past the
maximum c[i] (given some redundancy in the input).
I imagine that John Pettitt may have written:
