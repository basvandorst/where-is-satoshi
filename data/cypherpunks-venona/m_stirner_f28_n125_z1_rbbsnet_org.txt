@_subject: Origin lines in remailers 
In response to to call for more remailer traffic, I have been attempting
to disseminate the instructions for remailer use among users not members
of this list.
One of the problems that has arisen is the retention of the origin lines
placed at the bottom of the outgoing message by various gates & net
whatnot (see bottom of this message for an example).
Just before I lost access to this list a few months ago, I know that
there was a discussion on how this problem could be solved with both the
Cypherpunks & Penet remailers, but a conclusion had not been reached by
the time I left.  I did not notice a reference to this problem/solution
in either the Penet or Cypherpunks remailer helpfiles (which seem to be
both unchanged from earlier this year).
If this problem has been solved, would some kind soul post the fix here
for us?

Yes, this seems fraught with problems.

The BlueWave blurb was added by the program & can be stripped by
re-editing the message before upload.  Everything else is out of my
control completely & added automagically by the host or the UUCP
gateway.  The sucker stays, no matter what I do.  Some anonymity!

I, personally, could live with it just to get the remailers to be truly
anonymous.  The rest of the user input is not especially easy anyway,
particularly if accessing internet via a gateway.  Another line wouldn't
kill me.

As an interrim measure I guess this is what I'll have to do, but as an
early PGP partisan, I've had enough PGP experience not to be turned off
by the extra trouble.  Most casual users would be.  In any case, I think
that this is undoubtedly the most user-labor-intensive solution.

The number of lines added seems to vary with the gating.  I'm sort of
leaning toward a
........8<....(cut here).....8<.......
kind of solution; I mean, I know for a fact where I stopped, so anything
beyond that ought to be eaten by the remailers, IMHO.  There is probably
a good argument against that solution, but I can't think of it offhand.
