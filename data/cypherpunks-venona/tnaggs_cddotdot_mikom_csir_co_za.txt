Declan McCullagh kindly forwarded Mike Godwin's comments thusly:
Er no, in practice it is hard to persue a libel case in the UK where the
publication has responded immediately with a printed apology - especially
if the apology is prominently placed.  The mail catenated to Godwin's
comments (from PRZ himself) indicates that the Sunday Telegraph will be
publishing such an apology in their next edition.  An out of court settlement, apart from lawyers costs, may yield a charitable donation but
it certainly looks like PRZ will benefit from a sympathetic article which seems to me to be a pretty good result!

OnTrack are one of the biggest data recovery companies in the US, there
are probably many others ... but some of the smaller operators are less well equipped with (software) tools ...
The biggest problem is that the guy has already re-installed DOS &
his wordprocessor, this has likely destroyed much of the residual
information about his disk layout *unless* the format operation left
'unformat' recovery information on the disk.  (Deliberate attackers
would likely know how to disable this.)
