Hello out there!
verification command (control-V).  It looks for either a RIPEM or PGP
signature line and passes the article to the appropriate command for
verification.  (Strn leaves it up to the user to interpret the output
of the command.)
list can help me with:
system("pgp -m foobar") might cause legal problems?  Strn doesn't
implement any cryptographic techniques.
I would like to greatly expand strn's cryptographic features, but I'd
rather not implement features that many of strn's users can't use.
(That includes me--I won't use PGP until/unless the legal issues are
 cleared up.)
a "verify signature only" switch for PGP.  Most of the applications I
would like to use don't involve data hiding--just signature verification.
I'm also lobbying the RIPEM author to include a similar feature.
newsreader cryptographic features feel free to send mail.  I hope to
do some work later with things like remote reconfiguration, trusted
ratings, suggested reading lists, and the like.
P.S.  Strn is about 10K lines of C code added to trn.  It is
(probably) just a few weeks away from a public beta test.  If anyone
really wants to test strn, let me know and I'll consider it.  More
information is also available via finger or mail.

@_subject: USENET and US-legal PGP (signing only?) 
Hello again!
negotiations still in progress or are they stalled?
to help integrate PGP with USENET newsreaders.  (I have a little
PGP/RIPEM signature verification fuction now, and a section called
"Digital signatures, cryptograpy, and USENET" in the online documentation.)
I am waiting for a US-legal version of PGP before coding further.
public key crypto applications.  My particular interest is in digital
signatures for forgery protection.  One use of this is in collaborative
message filters where people can rate or add keywords to other
messages.  I would like for all of this to be updated semi-automagically,
using usual (insecure!) USENET postings.
political arena.  Many people don't see why the current cryptograpy
battles are important, because they don't care very much about strong
privacy.  An easy-to-use cryptosystem integrated into their ordinary
tools like newsreaders and mailers will get some of these people involved.
For instance, imagine these interactions:
----- start examples -----
[While reading news, the user types 'r' to reply to a message]
The poster included a PGP encryption key, and will accept encrypted replies.
Encrypt your reply? [nyh]
[User posts a message]
PGP key found.
Sign this posting? [yn]
[User types 'y']
Signing posting using PGP key.
Enter your passphrase:
[User posts a message]
Digital signature not found.
Would you like to generate a digital signature? (type 'h' for help) [nyh]
[user types 'h']
A digital signature allows other people to have some confidence that
your postings are really from you, and not a forgery.
...[more explanation of digital signatures, about 10-15 lines]...
Generating a digital signature usually takes between 5-15 minutes.
You will only have to do this once.
Would you like to generate a digital signature? (type 'h' for help) [nyh]
[user types y]
PGP found.
RIPEM not found.
Generating digital signature using PGP...
[Nice, friendly key generation process.]
----- end examples -----
*subset* of PGP which allows only signatures and signature
verification?  To my knowledge this wouldn't require violating the
RSAREF interface.  (My understanding is that the interface problem
is that PGP uses IDEA rather than DES for message encryption.
The signature is simply an RSA-encrypted hash of the message--this
could be handled by the RSAREF package.  Correct?)
