****** Hal <74076.1041 ******
If I understand Karl right, he got this cascade of aliases because he
tried to talk to HIMSELF through different accounts/aliases at alternate
ends of the chain. Since no one would want to do that (other than to
test things) normally, this wouldn't be a problem.
But I already *do* control the order of use for MY mail, that means
stuff I send out and stuff people send to me in DIRECT reply to my
stuff. There is nothing to stop someone from sending to my id on pax say
through a first remailer of their own choice, provided they originate
the mail (i.e. a REPLY is not equivalent to ORIGINAL mail in this case).
As for picking my own alias, this sounds appealing but is actually much
weaker then a randomly assigned one. Besides that, it could be an
administrative nightmare for the sysadmins on the aliasing systems.

****** Hal <74076.1041 *****
Yes I suppose, but I can ignore them. Let's see if I got this right. In
the following scenario, I will represent alias servers and their aliases
in the following way: A-123 where 'A' is the server, and '123' is the
I receive a message from Z-999. I have no idea how many servers this has
gone through. I *originate* a message back to this person, but I sent it
first through *my* preferred alias chain, so the message goes from me
through A-123 -> B-456 -> Z-999 and then somewhere else (perhaps) before
reaching its final destination.
Now the Z server has never seen a message from B-456, so it
automatically generates a NEW alias (Z-111) for that ID. Now machine Z
bounces that new alias back along the chain B-456 -> A-123 and thence to
me, informing me that an alias has been established on machine Z for my
ID on machine B. It also uses that alias to send the message along to
the next machine on the chain (if there is one) which also creates a new
alias (never having seen a message from Z-111), and bounces it back,
etc. I see that this is where I get to detect the alias path my
recipient is using, but there is an easy solution (see below).
So one or more new aliases will be generated (you are correct) in
response to my original mail, BUT, I can ignore those aliases (once I
receive them in the reflected mail) and never need think about them
again because the link between B-456 and Z-111 is now established.
Further translation will take place automatically with no further bounce
backs in any future correspondence between the two parties *if* they
both use their own chosen mail paths consistently.
If in my next mail, however, I REPLY to Z-999 (i.e. I don't generate
original mail), then another alias will be generated on the Z machine
for mjr and I will also be informed of that, etc. Once again,
however, I don't have to care about that. From the recipients viewpoint,
however, mail has now been received from two different aliases that
represent the same person (one for my original mail, and one for my
There are two possible solutions while still generating automatic
1) Don't alias someone who hasn't specifically requested it (e.g. with a
ping or something). This is probably not a good idea. I like the fact
that these Aservers take a "most conservative approach" automatically
assuming that someone wants to be aliased if they are
originating/replying to an aliased ID.
2) Stop the alias-information-bounce-back unless someone specifically
requests it (e.g. with a ping). This might do the trick. I don't have to
KNOW what my alias number is even on the machine that does the first
outbound and last inbound conversion. All the conversions along the
chain are automatic, so why should I care what my alias numbers are?

@_subject: Cascading Aliases 
The discussion just above between Karl, Hal, Johan, and myself, has
made me realize that the standard "bounce back" behavior of all the
alias servers I've used so far actually defeates the purpose of remailer
chains no matter how one embeds the forwarding information.
When any person *first* replies to or originates mail across a remailer
chain, a new alias is generated at each hop (however many). So far, that
is good, a "most conservative assumption" approach, and it provides
easily for reply channel maintenance. The problem is that each machine
also reflects its new alias back along the chain to the message
originator thereby revealing the entire chain to the message originator,
something that might not be desirable to the party on the other side.
The solution is very simple, just stop bouncing the new alias
information back along the chain. This can not HURT anyone using the
alias/remailer system because you never need to know what your aliases
are as the conversion and forwarding process is automatic. If someone
needs, for some reason to KNOW his alias for a given system (or all of
them) on *his/her* chain, he/she can easily arrange to ping the server
at the appropriate level.
Besides not hurting any current operations, Stopping the *automatic*
reply to sender about a new alias helps to secure everything a great
deal more because it hides the "other guy's" chain, something that both
parties might reasonably expect.

***** norm (Norman Hardy) *****
I can too, but I suspect they wouldn't last long, particularly if they were
commercial systems and their paying users felt that the anonymity option was
something to be desired.
I worry about institutional constraints much more, particularly at the
national level "All machines on the Internet in this country will insure
that mail originators are identified...", etc. Even this can be overcome
technically though (smarter signature strippers).
This isn't necessarily so. I can appreciate some other person's desire
to remain anonymous in certain kinds of transactions. Also, people in other
parts of the world seem much more sensitive to issues of privacy then we
here in the US tend to be.
Well maybe, but this goes against the philosophical, political,
and technical grain of the International Internet as it now exists. I
note that the world already *is* polarized into camps to a greater or
lesser extent.
If there is eventual political and social fallout from the use of alias
remailers, I think it would be more of an us (the Internet community who use
remailers) vs. them (everyone else) kind of thing. I have detected murmurs
of dislike for people who use remailers just on general principles (i.e. you
should take responsibility for what you say).

Hal Finney:
Johan Helsingius:
I have to agree with Johan here, and with the way all (?) the Aserver
creators/administrators have chosen to go. Consider the following scenarios,
assuming that Person-X does not know anything about the particulars of the
Aserver(s) he/she is routed through when making a direct *reply* to an
anonymous message.
A) Person-X doesn't care if he/she is aliased when he/she replies, but
he/she is aliased anyway.
consequence: Not much, the message still gets through (as would a re-reply,
so if the Person-X *wants* to make his/her identity known later he/she can
always state it in a message body).
B) Person-X *wants* to be aliased in his/her reply, but *isn't* because the
Aserver doesn't do it automatically, and person-X isn't aware that such a
"switch" needs to be thrown.
consequence: Potentially disasterous to person-X!
I submit that automatic aliasing, by default, is consistent with the very
purpose of Aservers, more exactly their intended, legitimate, uses!
This doesn't mean that Aliasing software shouldn't contain some provision
for turning ON a switch that passes you through un-aliased, but this switch
should be for users who KNOW the server and how to modify its default
behavior. I wouldn't object to such a switch, but personally I don't see
much use for it either. Once I knew I wanted to reveal myself to someone, I
could just tell him/her in a message body. If they want to reveal themselves
to me, they can do likewise, and then we can address each other's machines
directly, bypassing the Aserver(s).
Now if these same creators/administrators would only *turn off* the
automatic (default) message saying: "An alias [ALIAS has been created
for you on Aserver the privacy of what seems to be a
growing, potential, aliasing network (Anetwork) would be significantly
enhanced. Reversing the default here would be consistent with the "most
conservative assumption" approach otherwise already taken with respect to

@_subject: multiple aliases. It doesn't matter how many 
***** Karl L. Barrus  *****
Yes, but so what? That is, why does it matter so long as all the
conversion from one to the next takes place automatically. The process
strengthens your security as well as that of any respondent. True this
may not be necessary, but under the circumstances (the whole point of
alias servers) isn't a "lets not take chances" approach best?
Lets take an extreme case (not that I'm suggesting things be implemented
this way). Imagine that every time you or anyone else originates mail
through an Aserver you are given a NEW ID (not just the first time, but
EVERY TIME). Again, so long as a relationship is maintained between all
your ID's on a given server and their corresponding ID's on the next
machine down or up the line, it shouldn't matter to you at all! After a
few years you could end up with hundreds or thousands of IDs. What
difference would it make? You don't need to know what *any* of them

**** Pat Farrel  writes
I hope not... At least not until the BBS operators and writers agree
on some standardized API so people like me and other third parties
can write PC based interfaces in a language of our choice. The problem
with current "coupled systems" (for example the Coconet BBS software)
is that they all rely on proprietary interface programs on the PC. If
I communicate with 10 BBS systems (large or small), I must have 10
different communications programs... No thanks...
Also keep in mind that much of the value of these systems comes from
their availability to the widest possible audience. There are people
in many parts of the world who still have nothing better then 1970's
style glass tty's and even paper-output type terminals!
Back on the issue of privacy and anonymity, I don't understand the lure
of all these schemes for hiding mail paths, etc. If encrypted messages
pass through one aliaser, and get decrypted (and aliased again) on
another machine, you are protected. The machine that knows who you are
can't read your material, and the machine that can read you doesn't know
who you are. Any further obfuscation adds little (IMHO) to your
security. Revelation of your identity (in either case) depends on
collusion between system administrators on the different hosts. True
this might be even less likely where 3 or more hosts are involved, but
how much less so? If some agency is powerful enough to force two systems
in different parts of the world (and the net) to reveal what they know
about you, the chances are they can force three or four, etc.

@_subject: Anonymity vs accountability - a balanced view (maybe?) 
Concerning the discussions of privacy, and anonymity on various USENET
groups, attacks on Johan Helsingus, etc. I'd like to add my two cents...
If we are going to convince the USENET community as a whole of the value
of anonymity it seems to me we must also recognize the propriety and
value of what seems to be the dominant sentiment on the USENET now, that
being that accountability and responsibility (for what you say)
reflected in a real identification is also valuable, and under most
ordinary circumstances is more desirable then not.
Putting it another way, I think most of the USENET community would
accept the argument that access to anonymity is something that we should
all have. It is a desirable thing, but it becomes desirable only under
certain circumstances (e.g. active persecution, or a real threat of
same, by a government or corporation, etc). Most of the time, it is better
that people "stand for what they say" and accept the accountability that
goes with non-anonymized postings.
If we approach it this way I think we could achieve consensus at least to
the degree that the existence of alias servers are generally supported.

Hal <74076.1041 writes...
This may be an example of an intractable problem. A case where
legitimate interests are mutually exclusive at least in practice of not
in theory.
If Johan has restricted output due to pressure from those communities,
then he has already been forced to hobble his service's most significant
*potential* benefit to the community. If a serious whistlblower were to
come along with some serious evidence and credibility, it is likely that
he/she would want to post his/her evidence in one or more of the groups
Johan has locked out! I mean no aspersion on Johan here, he is laboring
under pressure I'm sure, and he is a pioneer in all of this, and we are
sharing his experience. I don't mean to take political sides either,
both sides of the debate have legitimate arguments. In the one other
post I made on this topic before, I received but one reply remarking
that I "was preaching to the choir".
On the one hand, we have the principle of free speech and the right to
privacy and even anonymity if we so choose it. Taken in an unrestricted
way, this principle is rather radical (politically). True there are
areas of our social and political lives where a right to privacy and
anonymity are both desirable and generally accepted/practiced (these
vary of course in different parts of the world). But there are other
equally common areas in which they are not.
The strongest pressure against anonymity on the Usenet comes from
quarters where a strong positive pressure exists, on *principle* for
posters to "declare themselves", to "stand behind their words". In a
realm where egalitarianism, semi-anarchy, and bad signal/noise ratio
already make for a questionable mix or product value, "naming yourself"
is a significant benchmark. Even in these groups, most participants
would recognize the need for access to anonymity when it was really
"justified", but such cases are believed to be fairly few and far
between. as gg pointed out:
The mutually exclusive nature of these principles emerges in practice
from what a former boss of mine called the human "ornery" factor. In
this case that some number of individuals will exercise their "right to
anonymity" not because they have to, but just because it's there.
Believe me I sympathize with this view. It keeps authorities and
would-be authorities on notice that there are those who will test the
limits of their rights and signal the rest of us if they are eroding. I
also accept Hal's argument that we are protecting ourselves from
possible future abuses of central authority. But I also sympathize with
the sentiments of the other side, that most of the time it is desirable
to put your name where your mouth/keyboard is. A consensual solution to
this problem depends on a common political viewpoint, something that is
certainly not in the cards for contemporary net participants. Of course
a solution may one day be "imposed", but that will not likely be to
anyone's liking. The likely direction of such an imposition is signaled
by what Dave Clunie experienced at PAX and what Johan is now
experiencing as well.
