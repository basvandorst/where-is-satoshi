How about importing the scanned in source (in electronic form) back into
the States and doing a 'diff' there. This could produce an electronic
patchfile to repair the mistakes in the scanned in code, meaning that the
whole of the code could be cleaned up in one go. This patchfile could then
be exported as it holds no crypto source code. (Somehow this seems *too*
simple. Would this perhaps get up the US gubmint's nose? Have I missed some
nuance or implicit limitation?)

How far could this be pushed? In the extreme case we could supply a file full of junk (random bytes) and then apply a patch to it to turn it into source code.

I'm not sure I am convinced by this argument.
The "enemy within" seems to be the main focus of the discussions in the CP list. When the 'luckless squad that happens your way' is manned by your countrymen at the command of their (and your) government, what then?
As far as I can see, the result would be a *very* bloody civil war. The outcome may indeed be less obvious than in a 'conventional' (i.e. unarmed populace) civil war, but the cost much higher.
This is from the standpoint of a 'sissy' European. I admit I am poorly equipped to comment on the American Zeitgeist. However, my experience of civil war victims (refugees from the E-bloc) suggests that we should be concentrating on social revolution before we tool up for military. There is more to be won, with a potentially much lower cost.

By all means buy the hardware, that is after all your right. Just spare the
hero talk. *Everyone* thinks they'll be one of the survivors in a war, just
as 95% of the population believe they have an above average IQ.
My understanding of the word 'revolution' in this context means realigning
the opinions of the governments and peoples around the globe to allow
freedoms such as those supported by Cypherpunks to be freely available. An
example of this is to work against the misinformation spread by 'them'
which leads the average Joe (dumb or not) to think that 'Encrypted Data =
Child Porn/Drug Barons planning something big/More child porn'.

We have the same system at my [x], and I have played with the same idea
coming up with similar results (my value was somewhat lower - but this was
fag packet maths and therefore subject to error). In my fantasies I have
also connected this sequence to an array of solenoids which punch in the
number while you wait. The locks seem to be able to handle a throughput of
around 2 digits per second, meaning the average search time of 10 minutes.
Bear in mind that there are 8 of these locks - with the appropriate
hardware you could guarantee to be in in less than three mins.
The reason that this has remained in my fantasies is that any key changes
are predictable - the company is the (until last Wednesday) state owned
telephone company =) and the keyspace consists of the area codes for the
surrounding regions.
And this lock is the only thing that stands between the outside world and
25 Servers and 300 workstations.
Makes you think...
