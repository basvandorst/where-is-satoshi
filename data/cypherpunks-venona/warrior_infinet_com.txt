I am a novice, but in discussing some of the issues, i.e.; wiretap bill with my dad, Col (ret) from the Green Berets, he said we would have to return to short wave, if this happens.  Imangine pgp shortwave!  Of course, they would have to be mobile to evade trangulation or satellite pin pointing of transmission, which isn't yet available, will be some day. Some advice from a guerilla warfare fighter...

@_subject: Remailer Traffice Analysis 
Why not do what the government does, in addition to coding messages, they split one message over different frequencies in a certain order. So you not only have to have the ability to decode the message, but you must have all the parts in the right order to get the intelligence of the message.  Instead of frequencies use different remailers.
Apply this to remailers, develope a program like premail 2.0 to not only get the keys for the month, this part may be accessed by a password, then have the program to split the message into enough parts that no meaningful intelligence is obtained from one part, encrypt the parts, and sent them out using reordering and latency.
Example: type a message, xsplit the message, encrypt the various parts of the message, use a password to access the secret remailer to get the remailer keys,  then send the encrypted message out in the order obtained from the remailer keys best remailers in order.  The recepient would get the parts of the message over 24 hours, and would have to get the remailer keys order from the secret remailer by password, reorganize the parts in order, add them together and decrypt the public key or one time pad message.
Being a remailer yourself would provide additional security thru obscurity.
Reordering and latency would apply as well.  Stealth might be overkill, but who would question a vacation portfolio?

Alright Phil, way to go!  But think on this, I wouldn't give the LEA a key
to my house, or my car, why should I give them a key to my thoughts?  Give
me Liberty or give me Death, or something to that effect by Patrick Henry. They can pry my key and my guns from my cold dead body.  Another thing,
even the animals have a right by force to protect themselves, who does big
brother think they are by denying me the right to protect my life, limb,
property and thoughts from unauthorized intruders?  Surely, we must fight
them tooth and nail.

I find it appalling that the military was prevented from doing what was right, ie., defending civilians from tyrants, murderers, and despots.
I fault the politicians for their lack of guts, pride and integrity for the delay, allowing atrocities right in front our warriors with their hands tied behind their back.  If they were going to commit military force, stand back and let them do their job right.  We have allowed political cowardice to emasculate our military might.  Personally I found myself as a Vietnam Veteran embarrassed when a group of attaches (hooligans) turned away a US gunboat.
Damn the media and their libertarian, bleeding heart views, if you know to do right and fail to do so, evil will grow.  I cannot defend going there in the first place, but once sent they were commmited to do right.  I have a problem with the US being a world policeman, and I also feel that the NSA, NRO, FBI, CIA do not have the right to treat every man jack of us as criminals by invading our privacy by means of key forfeiture in order to catch kiddie pornographers, pedophiles, drug lords, and other criminals.  If we all had our guns, encouraged famaily values, developed neighborhood block watches, these criminals would have no where to hide and the LEA would have no excuse to trample on our rights of privacy.
John, I do not fault the misled younsters, but the politicians that use the media polls to make US foreign policy, and national security.
BTW John, Harvey means "called to war" or "warrior", all of my male progeny were soldiers, policemen, preachers and mercenaries, I can do no less than encourage real men to stand tall, be proud, do right, and not be cowered by tyrants, foreign or domestic.
Obviously, you keyed on my tagline, but did not address the rights of the
individual of privacy and self protection, and not turning over to big
brother lock, stock and key.  Even animals have the right of self defence
to further self preservation even including deadly force, where does big
brother get off by taking away our guns, treating us as criminals with the
cliche, you have nothing to fear or hide if you have not done anything
wrong.  This presumes I have done wrong already, the LEA are just trying
to treat law abiding citizens as criminals, not to preserve or protect,
but to get evidence by any means without a warrant, sounds like the
British are here again.

Actually Mike, I am apolitical, however to sensationalize a story for profit, ie, OJ Simpson, is wrong before the trail occurs.  It not only changes the course of justice and history, but also impairs the public's views and objectivity, and the right to trail by a jury of unbiased peers.
The media are not interested in the truth just profits and sensationalism.
What is rightist-leftist media?

Perhaps this is a prime time to sign all messages, and use hpack to protect those unix files and directories from prying eyes.  I am still trying to figure out how to set up PGPsendmail or AutoPGP or connect PGP to some mail program so this can be done automatically.  I would appreciate any help offerred.
Meanwhile, what can you do other than swamp their sysadmin with complaints, forward their antics to CERT, as they have done?

The last is the best but only allows five users, but the first two are mirrors of the last and are fast.  It is the most complete that I have seen, go for it.

ftp.uu.net  (US)? mirrors ftp.win.tue.nl (Netherlands) which mirrors ftp.informatik.uni-hamburg.de (Germany).
I think.  Europeans would probably use the last two so they don't import from America.  Also, ftp.win.tue.nl is faster as the uni-hamburg source is a great source for crypto, but only allows 5 users at a time.

Now mind you, this kind of writing is demented, however, what ever
happened to fiction, free speech and such.  At this rate, Steven Spielberg
should be in jail as well.  I thought you had to prove intent, the saying
something or writing it is not bad as long as you didn't have the intent
or present capability to carry out such.  BTW, I like all of Steven
Spielberg's writings and movies, and now HB830 from Oregon rears its head
and fangs.  Did this guy intend to threaten or was it fiction?  How would
they even know? Next thing you know they will limit all free speech.
