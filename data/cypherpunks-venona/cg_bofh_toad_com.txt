@_subject: Australian "calculatorcard" 
Hi everybody,
Yesterday, on UK Discovery, there was an item in the programme Beyond 2000
about an Australian card which implements a challenge-response protocol
and can be used for banking, etcetera. Basically, you give your card
number (over the phone), get a challenge number, enter your pin and
the challenge, and then give the response. All in CC format...
They plugged it as the ultimate identity-prover, so I'm kind of interested
in what's behind. Now, I know that Discovery constantly repeats old
stuff, so I'm not sure whether this is actually hot/new/... Can anybody provide me with pointers to more in-depth information about
this device and the algorithm(s) behind it ?

6. Premail 0.42alpha, by Raph. I know got elm+pgp sending its mail through
   premail, making elm a all-in-one solution for signing, encryption,
   decryption, nymming and all types of remailing. Perfect job!

I think a call to your local land registry office will get you a quite
precise bearing (although I never bothered to actually do that, not even
in the time when people were doing that for UUCP maps). It doesn't solve
the problem for LISP's, however - last time I checked it, MIT gave me
happily access from my CIS account...
