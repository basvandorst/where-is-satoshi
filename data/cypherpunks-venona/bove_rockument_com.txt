UPCOMING EVENTS
We recently returned from an elite financial retreat, Morgan Stanley's Ski
Weekend in Deer Valley, Utah (I know, life is tough), where we played two
sets for a crowd of CEOs and CFOs, and we had them dancing on the tables!
Highlights from that show:
Back in the U.S.S.R. (Beatles)
Secret Agent Man (Johnny Rivers)
