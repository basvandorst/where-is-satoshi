middle-man and middle-man I will eventually
drop one of the nyms in favor of the more robust nym server. I've tested

Hello Everyone,
middleman remailer. Actually it's quite simple. I was able to improve the
reliability and robustness of the remailer dramatically by changing
$config{"numshuf"} = 3; to $config{"numshuf"} = 2; in the .premailrc file
for the middleman remailer. Exhaustive testing demonstrated that no code
changes to middleman itself were required. The only variable that
demonstrated the most profound performance difference is shown above. I
invite others to test the remailer for reliability and report back to me.
If it works, I'll go public with it once again. Here is the public key for
middleman. Please note the slight name change from middle-man to
middleman. One less keystroke if you know what I mean. I invite your
middleman middleman d020c2e68f1861098812ffaadd6e8a7d 2.0.3
