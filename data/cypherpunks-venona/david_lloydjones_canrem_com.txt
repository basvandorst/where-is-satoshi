This DDJ reference to export control laws is pretty typical:

AS+ENCRYPTION software.  Is posting such software online worldwide the same as
  +exporting it?  If so, the State Department might have a thing or two to say.
The State Department may claim the right to have some say in things under the Commerce Clause, Article 1, Sec. 8 of the Constitution.  Seems to me, however, that the Fifth, Ninth and Tenth Amendments pretty clearly slap this claim down: the right to trade freely predates the United States, and is hence "reserved... to the people", in the language of the Tenth.                                    -dlj.

Actually real punks hack whole systems, so we go out and run Congress, (me) or Japanese science (my ex-wife) or the CIA and State Department in Africa (the woman I am about to marry). Everything you say about writing code, designing protocols, analysing ciphers and assessing risks (also writing articles and attending conferences) is pretty much correct.  It also helps to sleep with the right women at times, a point which seems to escape the essentially male computer-freek culture.  Good table manners and a certain amount of familiarity with other languages help; my next wife, for instance, is only mine because I can say "ayin l'gazal", eyes like a gazelle's, something I must have picked up while sussing out your local bunch of AK-47 carrying terorists -- or half-starved recent Canadian immigrants, whichever story you care to believe.
I have to leave now: I am about to be visited by my neighborhood sociopath, a guy who works for Steve Wynn and all those folksin Las Vegas.  He has a new and interesting story to tell me.  I've heard it all before.
But it's going to be interesting to hear the latest version.

Adam Shostack  sez:
AM+| if you have cable, Milton Friedman will be discussing Hayek on CSPAN   +| (I'm not sure whether I or II, I think I) this Wednesday at 8.
On behalf of the Second International may I comment, without seeing the show, but having read most of their books?
As far as Friedman and Schwartz are concerned they have made a good career out of a simple insight, "inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon".  When I was two and three years old being pulled around in a sled as my parents organised the socialist revolution (during the war this consisted of voting for the Commonwealth Party and opposing the Communists; Conservative and Labour, the government, were both so hated they were not in the game...) I was always told that inflation was too much money chasing too few goods.  Hmmm....
When I grew up I met people who had been two cells over from Hayek in their filthy Austrian jail.  Hayek kept on muttering: socialism leads to fascism, socialism leads to fascism, return to previous two clauses and repeat...
Social democrats, including my friend just down the corridor from Hayek, thought that fascism resulted from chaos, stupidity, and lack of social organisation.  I support the Lions Club to this day, sing Bingo for the Catholics; I support every farm co-op, not because I think their economics is sound but because I think that neighbours working together is something to be supported every time you see it.

What Milton says about Hayek on television will probably be clean, appealing, rational, and clear to the minds of the very young.  Limited, however, in its use.

TS+Actually, the "backing" of a fiat currency is the need to have some   +around to pay your taxes, else you go to jail.  You are taxed on many   +types of income, even if they are not directly exchanged in the fiat   +currency.  Somehow you have to get some.
This is pretty much true, but does not logically justify your TS+This also means that higher taxes can make the currency more   >desirable,   +lower taxes less, higher government spending less, lower government   +spending more, etc.
This is only somewhat true.
The most important factor is that currencies are traded on a fairly free market.  This means supply and demand, not any firm intrinsic qualities of anything, dominate.  If a country is running a positive net balance, whether by trade, capital investment, or influx of rich refugees, there will be a demand for its funnypaper, and that paper's price, in other currencies will rise.  The same will apply to currencies not attached to countries -- such as the NetCredit, which I am working to put into reticulation.  That's electronic for "circulation".  :-)
The hardest currencies, roughly in order, are those of Switzerland, Taiwan, and Japan.  Germany is no longer on the list because Kohl bought the second last election in the most expensive bit of bribery in the history of democratic politics: the couple of trillion dollars he spent by assigning par value to the OstMark.  Hong Kong is not on the list because of the huge outflows for the development of China, which tends to balance supply and demand at a lower/softer level than it would otherwise have.  The US is no longer on the list because Reagan booted the whole thing into the can.

LP+Apologies if I repeat a question which has already been answered.
  +My only gateway onto the Net is very expensive, and I miss many

  +made passing reference to humans' naivete in trusting public key
  +encryption, and some posters were seeking to contact professor
  +Vinge for clarification.  Has any further explanation been   +discovered for his distrust of PKE?
I once had a girlfriend who factored five digit numbers just by looking at them.  "29367?  No, that's not prime.  It's 117 times 251..."  Good ol' Elizabeth.  That's what you get for an "IQ" of around 175.  Surely there might be higher "IQ's" someplace else in Albert Szent-Georgi once told me his thought that an IQ difference of thirty points meant that one person solves by inspetion problems which no amount of explanation can make clear to the other.  He added that in a normal day we run into people spanning three such gulfs.
If an IQ of 100 routinely factors two digit decimal numbers, and you get another digit for every twenty or thirty points, then you're looking for beings with IQ's in the 1,000 range to factor 100 digits                        Cheers,

EC+There is a class of people called "idiot savants" who contain people who can
  +also solve such
  +problems by inspection - their IQs are often much lower than 100, so that
  +blows Albert's theory.  These so-called "idiot savants" can easily factor
  +100 digit numbers.  The ability to solve such problems is not tied to IQ,
  +as there are many such people with IQs of 150+ who cannot solve them.
Many idiot savants can multiply extremely large numbers, though I have not read of numbers with a hundred digits being involved.  Factoring large numbers is an extremely different kettle of fish, and I know of no writing about idiot savants doing difficult factoring.  If you have references to any such performances, I'd like to read them.
Szent Georgi's remark was addressed to general intelligenc in everyday life, not to bravura arithmetic.  My scepticism about all things IQish was supposed to be indicated by my use of quotation marks on "IQ".

I don't see too much reason to suppose that this is true.  The CIA
