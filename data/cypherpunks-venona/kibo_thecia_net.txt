@_subject: soft drugs? Artikel about XS4ALL in New York 
see, the whole problem here is the same as usual.
people mixing up pot with "other" allegedly "soft drugs."
Pot must never be mixed up with anything.
an Excellent Idea!
See, you can not trust any of those fucking foreigh Countries.
Even Holland, which is supposed to be the home for pot, arrests
people for "offending content."
It has become apparent that the First Amendment which guarantees
Freedom Of Speech, must be applied world-wide, in order to protect
de-facto Universal Freedoms, which all come from Common Law.
I like the idea of attacking and eliminating their POP altogether.
He who interferes with Freedom Of Speech deserves to have their POP
soft drugs?  "drugs" is a bad word.  pot is not a "drug" by the common
connotation in society.  pot is a medicine and an herb.
Yes, I read about that.  I sure hope it is possible.
"Freedom Of Speech" must become the Universal World Standard for the InterNet.  We have a long way to go.

@_subject: Re: CFV: moderate sci.cryonics -- I vote NO 
this deals with a sci newsgroup being moderated, which
is an exception to the "unmoderated" rule.
Given the subject, the attempt to limit the content is
going to be tough.  What do you do with the religious zealots
which say "God does not like frozen people" ?
You had better specifically define what a "personal attack" is.
You may never limit my ability to call you a "motherfucker" in any forum,
and if you call that a "personal attack" then you have a censorship
And what about crossposting?  Does the charter put any limit on that?
Any limitations on that are Unconstitutional.
Exactly, and anonymity is a constitutional right.
Both this David Bostwick and this Charles Platt are suspicious characters.
They have past or present bofh.cabal connections, do they not?
