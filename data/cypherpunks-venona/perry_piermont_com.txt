Its true. The issuers often end up making most of their money for a
transaction on the fee and not on the two points off the top -- that
money ends up getting divvied up and lots of it disappears into fraud
costs and other similar places. The other big place they make their
money is on the interest they charge people who don't pay off their

negotiable commercial paper. Checks, notes, and other instruments are

Actually, it isn't. Its an instruction to the bank to pay to someone's

are funds in the bank that can pay. The check isn't a certificate of
the existance of funds -- only of the existance of an order by the
account holder.
Well, the point that I'm trying to make is that a bond certificate is,
provided you don't think its a forgery, an actual bond. It isn't,
however, the actual underlying money, because the issuer can
default. If someone is trying to buy a bond the bond certificate in
some sense allows you to clear the transfer, but it clears the
transfer of the bond, not the payment of the obligation. I'm probably
being a bit obtuse here, but I suspect my point is made...

You could do that, but thats not how C does things. C allocates these

subroutine exit, and allowing you to force your own machine code into
the system for execution.
I suspect that even were subroutine data allocated in a seperate heap

Its not a bad way to go. You have to make sure that you have at least
that many bits of ENTROPY, however. Stuff like keystroke timings
should only be thought of as handing you a bit or so per click.
That is true. It actually shouldn't be -- every PC has the same timer chip or a
compatible one. The real question is whether Windows lets you get the
data out.
Also be especially careful about how you run the thing! Don't use
popen or anything like it!
You have to build to the model of someone who knows everything there
is to know about the machine. Why? Well, many pieces of information
can in fact be extracted -- license servers and SNMP agents are a way
to extract things like system IDs. (Overly chatty SNMP extensions and
similar stuff make me nervious about using too much ps based entropy,
by the by.)
If you put PROM ID into the hash, don't count it as a source of bits

actively evil.
Just as I tend to see all computer systems installations in terms of
securing them from attack (a couple of clients have noted I have
security on the brain!), I suspect they see all things in the world in
terms of signals intelligence. Whenever anything comes up that
threatens their day to day way of doing things, they react badly --
its very natural. They don't want their work made hard or, even worse,
their jobs destroyed.
Certainly some of their masters at some times have been evil, and will
continue to be in the future, just as in any governmental
organization. Certainly some individuals working in the organization
are evil. However, in general, what you are looking at is just the
result of an entity trying to preserve itself having access to
governmental force. I doubt that there are many "national domination"
types in the agency, and there don't need to be for their agenda to be
opposed to ours.
I'll point out, though, that if anything this makes our job harder,
because strong crypto in the hands of the bulk of the world's

that a bug in the code outside the Java implementation can screw with
the internals of the Java implementation in such a way as to get it to

complex a language for me to believe that it can have been perfectly
specified and implemented.
Enormous risk -- I really mean ENORMOUS risk -- is being taken in
order to add a little convenience in making web applications pretty.
Someday, there is going to be big trouble from this. *BIG* trouble.
You heard it from me first.
You might ask "Perry, what could possibly satisfy your perfectionistic
criteria?" Well, a language that didn't have any I/O or similar
"dangerous" capabilities in it at all, rather than one in which such
capabilities were selectively "restricted", would be one I would feel
much more comfortable trusting. If written in a fairly safe language
where it is hard to pull buffer overflow tricks, the interpreter for
such a language would be very hard to pervert into doing untoward
things. Java isn't like that, though. Its got the full power and glory
of any other language, and the only thing sitting between a HotJava
app and some really nasty viral effect is a paper thin shield -- the
security model. A couple of bits twiddled in the right place and the
shield is gone.
The best things about Java could probably have been achieved without
giving it so much power. Its too late now, though. The bandwagon is
too far along. As a security consultant, I'm of course in a position
to profit from the wreckage, but frankly I don't like that any more
than an aircraft disaster expert wants to see more aircraft accidents.

As an aside, have you tried breaking your own program? Spend a week on
it some time. Its usually an educational experience and it breaks you
out of the mindset you have fixed in for a while.
As people have found out, it has proven possible to core dump the Java
interpreter. That means that your implementation has contained flaws
that potentially permitted people to do unplanned things to the state
of the interpreter.

what garbage it puts out. Such design is needed whether the systems

If you are actually 13, I apologize for the comments I made earlier.
However, if you are really are that young your questions are
understandable, as was your manner. I got started in computers when I
was about eleven many, many years ago, and I remember what its like
when you know more than most adults about technology but don't quite
know how to interact with other technical people yet. (I also remember
that I didn't appreciate people thinking that I didn't know how to
interact with other people, but thats another story.)
By the way, generally, it works better when you join a new mailing
list if you sit and listen for a while to get the flavor of what is
going on.
Anway, let me try to answer your question.
We don't study cryptography and data security for any one reason -- we
are a big and very diverse group of people and we have many different
reasons for what we do. However, many of us are interested in the
topic for political reasons. We view cryptography as a way to ensure
freedom and privacy for people around the world, and we try to advance
that cause by studying cryptographic systems and sometimes computer
security in general. Other reasons people like doing cryptography work
is that its a fun area of math/computer science to fool around with in
and of itself, and that some of us, including me, have paying work
doing things like computer and network security.
Most of us don't want to break in to computer systems for the sake of
breaking in to them, and in fact most of us don't even actually break
in to computers per se, but we do try to break badly designed
cryptographic software and security systems in order to get people to
build them better -- we tend to publicize these efforts both so that
we can get as many people working on them as possible (the more brains
the better) and so that we can make sure that people are aware of
flaws so that they will fix them or so that, if they aren't fixed,
people will avoid the software with the problems. "Security through
obscurity" is something we usually dislike around here, and you may
see the term "security through obscurity" used as a way of insulting
some cryptographic system or security sytem from time to time if it
depends on people not knowing how it works in order to keep it secure.
If you are interested in cryptography and in learning a bit about what
we do, I suggest that you first read a good introductory book on
cryptography like Bruce Schneier's "Applied Cryptography" (which is
coming out in a new edition in only a few weeks) and that you listen
a bit to the conversation around here -- you might also want to read
some of the back archives of the mailing list on You also might have other questions. One good way to deal with them is
to first see if you can find the answer in Schneier's book or the
archives, and then to try to ask the list if its a question that lots
of people might want to think about, or send mail to a single person
who probably knows the answer if you don't think its worth bothering
everyone about.
Above all, its important to remember that people around here are often
trying to get work done, and will answer quiet, polite questions
before they will answer loud and obnoxious ones.

As a smart EE, its very easy for you to personally understand the

you can trust it. On the other hand, consider a black box Johnson
noise based device that you are handed. You check the random numbers
coming out; they seem roughly right. You know, of course, that the box
could simply be a very clever Blum-Blum-Shub based PRNG with the seed
being stored at the enemy's secret lab, and you wouldn't have any
solid handle on how to determine that without taking the device apart.
On the other hand, I can take a radiation detector and test it damn
easily with easy to aquire calibrated sources.
Certainly you can't put such a device into a portable phone -- a Zener
diode beats a geiger counter in such cases. On the other hand, a
portable phone has to deal with a threat model in which there are very
simple ways -- like plain eavesdropping -- to hear the
conversation. If, though, you have a large electronic bank's central
key management machine in mind, the extra trouble of using an external
radiation detector would probably be worthwhile, assuming you had
plugged other holes, given the ease with which the system may be
tested and the amount of cash at stake.

connections and RSA operations really might not be noticed in a half
dozen years.

Several people have asked for this. You might want to email him to ask
if the offer is still open, since this was a while back.
The SECOND EDITION of APPLIED CRYPTOGRAPHY is coming in November. This is a major rewrite: 50% more words, 7 more chapters, and
over 1600 references.  Not only did I make corrections to the
first edition and add developments since it was published, but I
also included topics left out of the first edition.  (See table
of contents--attached.)
The second edition has lots of new algorithms (including GOST,
Blowfish, RC4, and A5), more information on the Clipper Chip and
key escrow, dozens of new protocols, more information on how PGP
works, detailed information on key management and modes of
operation, and new source code.
The second edition will be published in paperback and hardcover. Right now I am making both available at a 15% discount.

There are three things we are currently missing in the architecture,
1) We need a certificate system to replace X.509 and that plays nicely
   with distributed databases.
2) We need to implement the Eastlake/Kaufman method for embedding
   certificates in the DNS or something similar.
3) We need a good entity naming model.
Given all those being implemented, sometime soon I can see people
telnetting or ftping hither and thither without ever noticing or
caring that their sessions are completely encrypted.
We also have the following need:
4) A good MIME mailer (that looks like NeXT Mail or something like it)
   which has hooks for something MOSSlike that uses the same
   certificate infrastructure described in 1-3 above.
5) SHTTP capable browsers that also use 1-3 listed above.

Anyone who'd like to help me put the sources to the NRL IPsec + IPv6
implementation up for FTP is invited to get in touch. It will runs on
4.4BSD machines (i.e. BSDI, NetBSD, FreeBSD, etc) and should be

The IETF has many sorts of standards. It explicitly has a way to

which should have the ability to interoperate if you do them.
My opinion is that it is fairly clear that Photuris is the key
management system people will be using, although it is going to have
to evolve to work with a real network wide certificate database
infrastructure. SKIP isn't going to be the standard.
IPSEC, SKIP, IPv6, etc., all require kernel mods. You can't help
it. Its part of the IP stack, you know.
BTW, IPv6 uses IPSEC, but IPSEC isn't only for IPv6 -- its also usable
in IPv4. We were careful about how we architected that.
The NRL code implements IPsec for both v4 and for the v6 stack it
comes with. In fact, the NRL code is primarily an IPv6 implementation

Unfortunately, an internetworking protocol used by only one vendor
gets nowhere.
I doubt it. Ashar Aziz and company at Sun are pretty much
ego-committed to SKIP. Their group might not have nearly as much
justification for its existance without it. That probably makes them
reluctant to go in the right direction.
SKIP is really very alien from the direction most of IPSEC is
taking. It sacrifices a lot of functionality for the perceived benefit
of being able to send an encrypted packet to a host "without prior
negotiation". Unfortunately, that benefit turns out to be a mirage
because in any real network you would need to do a certificate lookup
in order to actually decrypt the packet, at which point you've lost
any advantage. SKIP requires all sorts of hooks into the ESP/AH packet
formats which makes it essentially incompatbile with ESP/AH
implementations. SKIP uses long term keys which could really hurt if
they were compromised. SKIP doesn't do perfect forward secrecy. I
could go on and on.
Ashar keeps answering every criticism with "well, you COULD do X in
SKIP if you just hung this kludge onto it, but of course we hope most
people would never do that".
I started with a lot for respect for the guys and lost most of it

Totally untrue. The process can take an arbitrary amount of wall clock
time, not user time.
In the case of the heavily loaded machine, the problem is gone -- the
opponent can't precisely predict this. Provided you take the same
amount of process time no matter what, you are okay.
(To be technical, user time doesn't pass during sleeps, but that
doesn't matter -- the problem gets fixed anyway).
I don't think so. First of all, you can still extract some
information. If you have been gone as long as the maximum computation
plus the maximum random fudge, you know that you had to have conducted
the maximum computation. This means that some bits are indeed
leaking. Your approach also has the disadvantage that it is hard to
produce good random numbers -- you are perhaps familiar with that problem?

information or private information available, ergo, they can't check
their LEAF equivalent.
This is likely where the flaw in the scheme is -- it should be trivial
to drop another public key in place of the government one and foil the
entire thing with minimal effort. All will look normal until someone
tries to use the GAK private key.

Hmm, it could, but it isn't going to be trivial unless the thing is
running straight RSA without a random pad.
If it isn't randomly padding, then it possible to make a table of the
2^24 possible encryptions and break traffic without knowing the RSA
key the government uses. It would require about 16GB of storage,
granted, but that isn't exactly impossible in todays world -- that
only costs about $4000. It would also require a lot of CPU, but not an
impossible amount and the investment would be one time. Given such a
table properly indexed, you could crack any passing key just by
indexing to find out three bytes of the 64 bit key and then go after
the other 40 in fairly short order. That would make a new "Hack IBM"
(Lotus is owned by them) promotion on C2 rather fun!
If they are randomly padding, then they would have to send the pad
along, presumably encrypted under the RC4 key or under Bob's RSA key.
Someone has to deconstruct the code. At this point, we are starting to
fly off into the world of speculation.

who prints a list of names and fingerprints on paper and xeroxes
enough for everyone attending.
Each person gets a sheet. Either each person in the room reads their
fingerprint in turn from their own copy, with each person in the room
checking the read fingerprint against the fingerprint on the handout,
or an appointed reader (or set of readers at the last IETF) read the
fingerprints in turn and ask the owner of the key to then simply say
"yes" or "its mine" or whatever to verify that the fingerprint matches
their own copy of the print.
Afterwards, each person will have a sheet with checkmarks next to
every fingerprint they think really belongs to a particular person's
key. They then go off later on, download the keyring for the party
from sonewhere, and sign everything they want to sign and mail back

extraordinary powers by virtue of association with this Divine Entity,
but when I glance at them I usually see only ordinary humans, with no
visible stigmata of their association with this extracorporeal Holy
Being worshiped by the body of the people.
In any case, we are here expected to believe that it is okay if the
Secular God of our land mass, our Government, spies on the Secular
Gods of other land masses. However, viewed from my perspective, when
"the Government" of our land listens in on "another Government's"
communications, from what I can tell what is happening is that
individual humans in the guise of High Priests converge at their
temple in Fort Meade for the purpose of listening in on conversations
between individuals humans elsewhere who are associated with other
Government cults in some sort of ordained capacity. One might argue
that this discourtesy between the followers of rival cults is not
something for we, the arch-atheists, to care about, but I must note
that in principle what is going on is the same -- people are listening
in on other people's communications -- not the Divine Governmental
Being itself listening in on the communications of other Divine
Governmental Beings. These Divine Governmental Beings don't
exist. Only the humans claiming the authority of the Divine
Governmental Beings exist.
So, in summary, if we believe that it is wrong for our fellow humans
to tap phones and listen in on the communications of other humans, I
see no reason to believe in an exception granted to some humans
associated with the Government Cult of our land mass to listen in on
humans associated with the Government Cult of another land mass.
This might be fine were there such a creature as a Holy Governmental
Being that wished to listen in on other Holy Governmental Beings, but
just as one never actually could prove the existance of the Capitoline
Jove in spite of the great temple that the Romans built to Him, so too
I find no evidence for the existance of the Holy Governmental Being in
spite of the fervor of the followers who have built the great marble
temples in the manner of the Romans all over Washington and other
provincial capitals throughout the Empire, pardon, the land mass we
call the United States.

Well, the topic was initially quite cryptography related -- a
discussion of the question of whether government cryptanalysis efforts
are a "good idea". However, in my last message on the topic you
probably saw that I noted that the issue had certainly slipped
sufficiently from the local agenda that I personally noted that it was
no longer appropriate for me to post on the topic. I don't intend to
say anything more about it since it no longer was merely a discussion
of whether we need an NSA.
However, redirecting the topic, I will note that Phill's assertion
that U.S. cryptographic intelligence versus the Japanese at the start
of World War II was inadequate is just plain wrong. We had already
broken virtually every important Japanese diplomatic and military
code, including perhaps the greatest feat of cryptanalysis of all
time, the breaking of PURPLE. See "The Code Breakers" for details.
And yes, discussing historical cryptanalysis efforts is indeed part of
the charter.

A question for our local attorneys.
There have been several times in the past where people have questioned
whether cryptographic hash functions like SHA and the like are
exportable under the ITAR?
In a joint declaration of facts not in dispute as part of Karn
v. State Department, the following was agreed by the government:
(see      34. Three of the source code listings on the diskette and in Part
         Five of the Applied Cryptography book, MD-5, N-HASH, and SHS
         are "hashing routines" that perform a data authentication
         function and, by themselves, are not controlled for export
         under the ITAR because cryptographic software that is solely
         limited to a data authentication function is excluded from
         Category XIII(b) of the United States Munitions List. See 22
         C.F.R. 121.1 XIII(b)(vi).
Would this not mean that the government is estopped from ever again
claiming that hash functions are export controlled under the ITAR?
Just curious as to whether or not things have been made more clear...
PS they also admit in the same declaration to having broken Enigma in
WWII. A shocking revelation.

I'm really sick of the folks who can post to libernet, com-priv,

The thing that makes Cypherpunks worthwhile is that its a place where
you could, once, get news updates about GAK, information on the latest
research into cryptography, organize mass key crackings, discuss APIs,
talk a bit about the politics of cryptography, etc.
Now, we get anonymous posters putting up bits on corruption in the
DEA, sections of Tsutomu Shimomura's sex life, and other garbage. I
don't give a damn if you think "Perry's a whining asshole; no one
appointed him God", the stuff I'm mentioning is almost totally

late great Kevin Mitnick discussion, and frankly, I don't give a damn
if he's in jail.) I also really am not impressed enough with the
justification for why Jim Bell's "ideas" need to be discussed here.
For some people without jobs (I won't name names) there is no problem
with this. However, some of us have trouble keeping up, and
unfortunately Cypherpunks has content that is key to our work and
interests. Sadly, there isn't another place with the momentum where people are a

Actually, I made  for one month. I was between jobs at the
time. It was 1990. I was not starting my new job for several weeks and
had nothing better to in the meantime. I always posted to the right
groups, or tried to.
As I keep emphasizing, the problem is not volume. It is selection. It
is very easy for me to select only those channels of information I
want to read provided that people keep the information going into the
proper channels. This is an effort that everyone across the net has to
work on. Nothing wrong with posting PROVIDED IT IS TO THE RIGHT PLACE.
Kill files help a bit, but ultimately they are not a substitute for
human filters. I *do* in fact just "d" messages I don't want to read
very fast -- within seconds -- but there are still limits to how many
messages one person can process. Between this and other lists I have
to spend several seconds each on hundreds of messages a day. That adds
up fast. 300*15=75 minutes of my day. I actually do better than this,
but I figure about one hour of my life, day after day, is spent
deleting garbage. Unfortunately, there are nuggets of gold inside, but
they are becoming harder and harder to find.
As I said, if its fine to put everything everywhere, then why not have
one single newsgroup and post everything there instead of thousands of
newsgroups and mailing lists?
The reason people are upset to read about Joe's Wash and Toast on
comp.lang.c isn't that there isn't a reasonable place to read about
that, but because the content is inappropriate for the particular
place. The problem with spamming is entirely that it forces people to
waste time looking at inappropriate junk. Its fine to read about the
green-card lawyers on a newsgroup dedicated to visas (and they will
probably be flamed there for charging for something free, but thats
another story), but its a public nuisance similar to dog poop on every
square of sidewalk when you have to read about it in every other
newsgroup. Inappropriate posts are exactly like dog crap on the
sidewalk. They don't kill you, and you can just "walk around",
but after a while you get sick of dealing with it hour after hour, day
after day.
Keeping appropriate postings in appropriate places is much like trying
not to park in such a way as to take up two spaces, trying not to
track mud into your apartment building, or other forms of good
citizensship. It isn't required, no law forces you to do it, but
everyone who isn't an asshole tries to follow the social conventions
because it makes life for everyone. Yes, its your right to park such
that no one can fit in behind or ahead of you, but is it something you
really should be doing?
Thats fine -- you not only have the right to write everything you like
but as a good writer you should. However, not all thoughts belong
everywhere. Do you randomize your public library, or do you try to
sort it? If you have ideas about whether Uri Geller is a fraud or not,
why not post them to sci.sceptic instead of here? Why try to post

Yes, they could. (Its IPSEC these days, by the way).
However, again, I don't think it will do them much good, especially
since forcing people to deploy strong cryptography everywhere isn't
in their best interests. They could try only doing the AH part of the
protocol, of course, but even then, using forged, stolen, or otherwise
ingenuine credentials isn't that hard. Crypto isn't a panacea, and if
you can't trust both endpoints its hard to trust the crypto itself...

IPG is both stubborn and stupid. How appropriate.
Let me give you another quote. It is acually a long extract of a
document written by Phil Zimmermann. Read it.
    Beware of Snake Oil
    ===================
    When examining a cryptographic software package, the question always
    remains, why should you trust this product?  Even if you examined the
    source code yourself, not everyone has the cryptographic experience
    to judge the security.  Even if you are an experienced cryptographer,
    subtle weaknesses in the algorithms could still elude you.     When I was in college in the early seventies, I devised what I
    believed was a brilliant encryption scheme.  A simple pseudorandom
    number stream was added to the plaintext stream to create
    ciphertext.  This would seemingly thwart any frequency analysis of
    the ciphertext, and would be uncrackable even to the most resourceful
    Government intelligence agencies.  I felt so smug about my
    achievement.  So cock-sure.      Years later, I discovered this same scheme in several introductory
    cryptography texts and tutorial papers.  How nice.  Other
    cryptographers had thought of the same scheme.  Unfortunately, the
    scheme was presented as a simple homework assignment on how to use
    elementary cryptanalytic techniques to trivially crack it.  So much
    for my brilliant scheme.
    From this humbling experience I learned how easy it is to fall into a
    false sense of security when devising an encryption algorithm.  Most
    people don't realize how fiendishly difficult it is to devise an
    encryption algorithm that can withstand a prolonged and determined
    attack by a resourceful opponent.  Many mainstream software engineers
    have developed equally naive encryption schemes (often even the very
    same encryption scheme), and some of them have been incorporated into
    commercial encryption software packages and sold for good money to
    thousands of unsuspecting users.     This is like selling automotive seat belts that look good and feel
    good, but snap open in even the slowest crash test.  Depending on
    them may be worse than not wearing seat belts at all.  No one
    suspects they are bad until a real crash.  Depending on weak
    cryptographic software may cause you to unknowingly place sensitive
    information at risk.  You might not otherwise have done so if you had
    no cryptographic software at all.  Perhaps you may never even
    discover your data has been compromised.
    Sometimes commercial packages use the Federal Data Encryption
    Standard (DES), a fairly good conventional algorithm recommended by
    the Government for commercial use (but not for classified
    information, oddly enough-- hmmm).  There are several "modes of
    operation" the DES can use, some of them better than others.  The
    Government specifically recommends not using the weakest simplest
    mode for messages, the Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode.  But they do
    recommend the stronger and more complex Cipher Feedback (CFB) or
    Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) modes.      Unfortunately, most of the commercial encryption packages I've looked
    at use ECB mode.  When I've talked to the authors of a number of
    these implementations, they say they've never heard of CBC or CFB
    modes, and didn't know anything about the weaknesses of ECB mode.     The very fact that they haven't even learned enough cryptography to
    know these elementary concepts is not reassuring.  And they sometimes
    manage their DES keys in inappropriate or insecure ways.  Also, these
    same software packages often include a second faster encryption
    algorithm that can be used instead of the slower DES.  The author of
    the package often thinks his proprietary faster algorithm is as
    secure as the DES, but after questioning him I usually discover that
    it's just a variation of my own brilliant scheme from college days.     Or maybe he won't even reveal how his proprietary encryption scheme
    works, but assures me it's a brilliant scheme and I should trust it.     I'm sure he believes that his algorithm is brilliant, but how can I
    know that without seeing it?      In all fairness I must point out that in most cases these terribly
    weak products do not come from companies that specialize in
    cryptographic technology.
    Even the really good software packages, that use the DES in the
    correct modes of operation, still have problems.  Standard DES uses a
    56-bit key, which is too small by today's standards, and may now be
    easily broken by exhaustive key searches on special high-speed
    machines.  The DES has reached the end of its useful life, and so has
    any software package that relies on it.
    There is a company called AccessData (87 East 600 South, Orem, Utah
    84058, phone 1-800-658-5199) that sells a package for $185 that
    cracks the built-in encryption schemes used by WordPerfect, Lotus
    1-2-3, MS Excel, Symphony, Quattro Pro, Paradox, and MS Word 2.0.  It
    doesn't simply guess passwords-- it does real cryptanalysis.  Some
    people buy it when they forget their password for their own files.     Law enforcement agencies buy it too, so they can read files they
    seize.  I talked to Eric Thompson, the author, and he said his
    program only takes a split second to crack them, but he put in some
    delay loops to slow it down so it doesn't look so easy to the
    customer.  He also told me that the password encryption feature of
    PKZIP files can often be easily broken, and that his law enforcement
    customers already have that service regularly provided to them from
    another vendor.     In some ways, cryptography is like pharmaceuticals.  Its integrity
    may be absolutely crucial.  Bad penicillin looks the same as good
    penicillin.  You can tell if your spreadsheet software is wrong, but
    how do you tell if your cryptography package is weak?  The ciphertext
    produced by a weak encryption algorithm looks as good as ciphertext
    produced by a strong encryption algorithm.  There's a lot of snake
    oil out there.  A lot of quack cures.  Unlike the patent medicine
    hucksters of old, these software implementors usually don't even know
    their stuff is snake oil.  They may be good software engineers, but     they usually haven't even read any of the academic literature in
    cryptography.  But they think they can write good cryptographic
    software.  And why not?  After all, it seems intuitively easy to do
    so.  And their software seems to work okay.        Anyone who thinks they have devised an unbreakable encryption scheme
    either is an incredibly rare genius or is naive and inexperienced.     Unfortunately, I sometimes have to deal with would-be cryptographers
    who want to make "improvements" to PGP by adding encryption
    algorithms of their own design.
    I remember a conversation with Brian Snow, a highly placed senior
    cryptographer with the NSA.  He said he would never trust an
    encryption algorithm designed by someone who had not "earned their
    bones" by first spending a lot of time cracking codes.  That did make
    a lot of sense.  I observed that practically no one in the commercial
    world of cryptography qualified under this criterion.  "Yes", he said
    with a self assured smile, "And that makes our job at NSA so much
    easier."  A chilling thought.  I didn't qualify either.
    The Government has peddled snake oil too.  After World War II, the US
    sold German Enigma ciphering machines to third world governments.
    But they didn't tell them that the Allies cracked the Enigma code
    during the war, a fact that remained classified for many years.  Even
    today many Unix systems worldwide use the Enigma cipher for file
    encryption, in part because the Government has created legal
    obstacles against using better algorithms.  They even tried to
    prevent the initial publication of the RSA algorithm in 1977.  And
    they have squashed essentially all commercial efforts to develop
    effective secure telephones for the general public.     The principal job of the US Government's National Security Agency is
    to gather intelligence, principally by covertly tapping into people's
    private communications (see James Bamford's book, "The Puzzle
    Palace").  The NSA has amassed considerable skill and resources for
    cracking codes.  When people can't get good cryptography to protect
    themselves, it makes NSA's job much easier.  NSA also has the
    responsibility of approving and recommending encryption algorithms.     Some critics charge that this is a conflict of interest, like putting
    the fox in charge of guarding the hen house.  NSA has been pushing a
    conventional encryption algorithm that they designed, and they won't
    tell anybody how it works because that's classified.  They want
    others to trust it and use it.  But any cryptographer can tell you
    that a well-designed encryption algorithm does not have to be
    classified to remain secure.  Only the keys should need protection.     How does anyone else really know if NSA's classified algorithm is
    secure?  It's not that hard for NSA to design an encryption algorithm
    that only they can crack, if no one else can review the algorithm.     Are they deliberately selling snake oil?     There are three main factors that have undermined the quality of
    commercial cryptographic software in the US.  The first is the
    virtually universal lack of competence of implementors of commercial
    encryption software (although this is starting to change since the
    publication of PGP).  Every software engineer fancies himself a
    cryptographer, which has led to the proliferation of really bad
    crypto software.  The second is the NSA deliberately and
    systematically suppressing all the good commercial encryption
    technology, by legal intimidation and economic pressure.  Part of
    this pressure is brought to bear by stringent export controls on
    encryption software which, by the economics of software marketing,
    has the net effect of suppressing domestic encryption software.  The
    other principle method of suppression comes from the granting all the
    software patents for all the public key encryption algorithms to a
    single company, affording a single choke point to suppress the spread
    of this technology.  The net effect of all this is that before PGP
    was published, there was almost no highly secure general purpose
    encryption software available in the US.
    I'm not as certain about the security of PGP as I once was about my
    brilliant encryption software from college.  If I were, that would be
    a bad sign.  But I'm pretty sure that PGP does not contain any
    glaring weaknesses (although it may contain bugs).  The crypto
    algorithms were developed by people at high levels of civilian
    cryptographic academia, and have been individually subject to
    extensive peer review.  Source code is available to facilitate peer
    review of PGP and to help dispel the fears of some users.  It's
    reasonably well researched, and has been years in the making.  And I
    don't work for the NSA.  I hope it doesn't require too large a "leap
    of faith" to trust the security of PGP.

The QC you perform is irrelevant.
The system you sell is insecure in a practical sense, likely uses an
insecure PRNG, and uses names and makes claims that come very close to
being fraudlent. It is harder, not easier, to manage the keys from

That is manifestly untrue. Read any information theory text.
There is only so much entropy in your stream of random numbers,
period. No amount of prayer, tantric meditation, or anything else will
generate more. It is not the "exact same effect" no matter how much
you might like it to be.
What you are flogging here is a pseudo-random number generator. You
are using this to produce what is properly called a stream cipher, NOT
a one time pad. We in the crypto community have been working with this
sort of thing for years.
If you start with 100 bits of entropy, your stream will have only 100
bits of entropy. If you start with 1024 bits, you will have a kilobit
of entropy, and so forth.
This may seem like a lot, but it really isn't.  Its easy to calculate
the unicity distance of a given key. The unicity distance is most
easily explained as the amount of ciphertext after which only one
possible decoding is possible and in theory brute force will extract
the key. The unicity distance is the information content of the key
(which is the log base two of the number of possible keys, or in this
case the equivalent, the number of bits of key) divided by the
redundancy of the language in question. The rate of english text is
somewhere around 1.3 bits per letter, so the redundancy of ASCII is
somewhere around 6.7 bits. For a 1024 bit key the unicity distance
will be, at best, around 150 characters. For a 5000 bit key, the
unicity distance would be around 746 characters. That means that there
is one, and only one, probable decoding of the ciphertext stream
resulting from your system after a fairly short period of time, and
one, and only one, possible key.
Now, finding that key is hard. Done right, it can be VERY HARD.
However, it is indeed possible given enough time.  There is a big
difference between something that is hard or very hard and something
that is information theoretically impossible. Breaking a PRNG is
always possible given enough compute cycles. Breaking a one time pad
is not. That is the difference.
Your phrase "can produce the exact same results as a one time pad"
are, in short, bogus. Claude Shannon proved this fourty years ago.

You cannot possible send your keys to the recipients encrypted in a

of keying material you would send your clients would use up one bit of
the material they had. That would mean that you could never send your
clients new keying material this way.
The phrase one time pad is a fraud, plain and simple. I mean that in
the most technical, legal sense. Advertise using that term and the FTC
can and will throw you in jail.
What you have here is some sort of conventional stream cipher conked
up from a PRNG. You've solved no key management problems. What you've
done is simply generate lots of hype. When I see the PRNG I suspect
that I'll discover that the thing is nothing more than some sort of
multi-pass linear congruential generator that cracks open like an egg.

   something you use as the key for a PSEUDO-random number

2) The term is PSEUDO-random number generator, not random number
   generator. Software cannot produce truly random numbers. It can at

Whether there is a conspiracy to convince people to believe things

faith. You can get out the source code and read it.
No change in algorithms occurred between PGP 2.3 and later versions,
so any claim that it was made breakable at that point cannot be made
on the basis that computing power is somehow now able to crack it when
it could not do so before.
I'm sorry, but I am bringing knowledge to the discussion. It is my
personal knowledge that PGP was built as well as the people who built
it knew how, and that it is believed to be free from major flaws by
them and those who have examined it. I do not believe that PGP is
totally bug free, and a subtle flaw in, say, the PRNG, or some other
spot, is not impossible. However, no such flaws were put in place
deliberately, and if such flaws exist they have escaped the notice of
literally hundreds of people examining the source code for problems.

I think it would be valuable if signature formats specified not only
an arbitrary key-id but a DNSable string or URL to retrieve the
certificate responsible for the signature. One of the things we've
learned from PGP is the difficulty of dealing with random numbers as
key ids. In this, I'm not sure we shouldn't be including better lookup
mechanisms. This is not to say that meaning should be assigned to a
lookup string beyond its saying where to find the key.

URLs are nice, but I'm not quite sure they are sufficient in practice,
though they are certainly theoretically sufficient. If I get a
document from someone, and it is signed, I'd like to be able to get
the key associated with the signature, and the URL is in theory enough
to do that. However, going in the opposite direction -- retrieving a
key associated with, say, a remote host's TELNET server, I'd like to
be able to query a server ask much more flexible questions than an FTP
URL would let me ask -- I might have a prefered public key system (RSA
versus DSS or what have you), I might want to be able to distinguish
between versions of the key, I might want to ask for all keys of a
certain class, etc.
In the end, we are probably going to need something in the way of key

@_subject: NRL IPv6 code 
I've just mailed off to Sameer Parekh the January '96 release of the
NRL IPv6 sources.  For those not in the know, this code implements the
IPsec protocol for both IPv4 and IPv6. IPsec is a cryptographic
protocol for securing IP datagrams -- it is now an IETF Proposed
Standard, defined in RFCs 1825-1829.
The code probably could use some work, but its not bad and a
reasonable start for all sorts of work.  This is a new version that
reportedly has lots of bug fixes -- I'm also given the impression it
may be the last NRL release of this code because the people doing the
work have left there -- if it gets adopted by the BSD community, it
will probably end up integrated into future NetBSD, BSDI and FreeBSDs,
which would be where to look for future releases.
The code should drop into BSDI almost out of the box -- it requires
more work for NetBSD and FreeBSD.

Yup, really evil folks. Lets go over some of the people on your list.
Bruce Schneier, cryptographic privacy advocate, cryptographer,
publisher of "Applied Cryptography", the book that signaled the end of
the NSA's ability to keep information on how to build cryptosystems
out of the hands of most people. A smart 14 year old, armed with a C
compiler and Applied Cryptography, cannot be prevented from writing
good cryptographic software. Is this the NSA enemies list, by chance?
Matt Blaze, cryptographer, privacy advocate, anti-authoritarian. The
guy who showed that Tessera/Fortezza cards were flawed and embarassed
the NSA in public with it. Regularly releases strong cryptographic
tools to the public. Participated strongly with me and others in early
efforts to build software only "voice crypto" systems. Tirelessly
criticizes control on cryptographic software. Is your list of
"enemies" supplied by the NSA?
Well, I'm not going to defend Jim. Besides, he can take care of
himself. However, although he isn't necessarily a friend of
cypherpunks, he's no friend of control of cryptography by the
government, which would put him out of business.
Shabbir: creator of voters telecom watch; privacy advocate, tireless
opponent of the CDA, free speech restrictions, network regulation, and
any other attempt at stopping freedom on the net. Shabbir is not a guy
you would call an advocate of authoritarianism.
Bill Stewart: "Hippie Anarchist"; he and his wife, Laura, are about
the most anti-government folks I think you are likely to find this
side of Alpha Centauri. Bill is as libertarian as they come, and
unconditionally opposes any attempts at restricting anyone's freedom
to live peacefully. The idea that he'd advocate anything that
increased the power of government is absurd. One of the nicest people
I know.
Phil Karn: Engineer's Engineer, crypto-hacker, privacy advocate. Phil
is suing the government right now to get the right to export
cryptographic software freely -- he has gone through a lot of trouble
to try to prove you have a constitutional right to distribute
cryptographic software and to prove that if you can ship it in print
you can ship it on disk. Phil ceaselessly advocates the use of strong
cryptography by everyone, and is one of the people who built the
predecessor of the current IETF IPsec standard. Phil worked very hard
on creating the Photuris key exchange protocol, which takes care to
make sure that all parties remain anonymous to eavesdroppers. Phil has
released large amounts of strong cryptographic code to the public,
including the fastest implementation of DES ever seen in
software. After an NSA flack spoke about his nightmare of every $80
digital phone on earth having unbreakable crypto in it, Phil quipped
something like "well, folks, now we know our design goal." Phil
tirelessly spreads the gospel of PGP. In short, he isn't on anyone's
short list of "friends of the NSA".
Declan is a tireless advocate of free speech, going so far as to work
hard to distribute speech he highly disagrees with if it is being
censored. I don't know him personally, but he hardly fits the profile
of "Friends of the NSA" or some such.
In short, Mr. Anonymous, you couldn't have picked a bigger bunch of
"Enemies of the NSA" for your "Friends of the NSA" list if you had
been explicitly instructed to pick the biggest opponents of
controls on cryptographic software and write them down. My question to
you is this: are you just stupid or ornery, or is the NSA paying you
for this?
Who is disappointed that he didn't make the "LIST OF SHAME", but
understands that perhaps he hasn't done enough to oppose controls on
cryptography. I'll work harder, and hopefully you will denounce me

circulate even in places like, say, China, or the U.S., where such
money might not be technically legal. However, to do that, it will be
necessary for some financial institution that people have substantial
confidence in to fill this role. Money is partially about trust, and
cryptography can only go so far in convincing people that their

The Fed does indeed monetize debt, but 1) that isn't related to

difference whether it is held in paper or bank accounts or anything
Again, you really don't know what you are talking about.
The vast bulk of the money in the field is not currency. Most of it is
in the form of bank deposits and is circulated through bank mechanisms
like checks and such.
When the Fed wants to expand the money supply, it buys government debt
on the open market, paying for it with nothing at all other than
changing numbers in the Fed's computers. This is how debt is
monetized. The bulk of that money never becomes dollar bills, and
whether it is circulated via checks or ecash or direct deposit or
whatever makes no difference to the amount of fake interest earned. I
say "fake interest" because it isn't real income to the government at
The amount of currency in circulation is dependant purely on demand by
consumers, via banks, for currency. When banks want dollar bills, they
ask the Fed -- they hand the fed electronic money and the fed gives
them back dollar bills. The amount of currency, however, has nothing
to do with the amount of bonds being held -- whether the monetized
debt is held in bank accounts, in dollar bills, or in ecash makes
absolutely no difference.
Again, you just don't know what you are talking about. E-Cash has no
impact on the fake interest earned by the fed, which is not seignorage
to begin with.

Jon asked why it is that I contend that a compression algorithm won't
in the general case even out the entropy of a semi-random stream.
The answer can be obtained by simply trying to run gzip over an image,
preferably one that hasn't been compressed. The results are, in
general, very bad, even though images are highly compressable (even
losslessly). I leave the why up as an exercise to the reader.
I have said before and I will say again that the only reliable way of
dealing with a stream that has some amount of randomness mixed in with
it that you wish to distil down into pure random bits is to use solid
reasoning to figure out how many bits of entropy per unit of input you
can actually expect to see, add a large fudge factor to cover your
ass, and then distil down using a cryptographic hash. Anything else
makes me highly nervous. If you can't estimate the amount of entropy
in an input stream from first principles, then you are probably in
trouble and should seek an input stream that you have a better handle

Full paper at:
}    There is no need to have the resources of an institution of higher

}expertise and a few hundred dollars would be able to attack 40-bit
}encryption much faster.  An FPGA chip --- costing approximately $400
}mounted on a card --- would on average recover a 40-bit key in five
}hours.  Assuming the FPGA lasts three years and is used continuously
}to find keys, the average cost per key is eight cents.
}    A more determined commercial predator, prepared to spend $10,000
}for a set-up with 25 ORCA chips, can find 40-bit keys in an average of
}12 minutes, at the same average eight cent cost.  Spending more money
}to buy more chips reduces the time accordingly:  $300,000 results in
}a solution in an average of 24 seconds; $10,000,000 results in an
}average solution in 0.7 seconds.
}    As already noted, a corporation with substantial resources can
}design and commission custom chips that are much faster.  By doing
}this, a company spending $300,000 could find the right 40-bit key in
}an average of 0.18 seconds at 1/10th of a cent per solution; a larger
}company or government agency willing to spend $10,000,000 could find
}the right key on average in 0.005 seconds (again at 1/10th of a cent
}per solution).  (Note that the cost per solution remains constant
}because we have conservatively assumed constant costs for chip
}acquisition --- in fact increasing the quantities purchased of a
}custom chip reduces the average chip cost as the initial design and

You made two magical jumps here. The first was the notion that they
are loaning out non-existant money. That is false. They only loan out
money that they have on hand, and the value of their assets in the
form of loans + reserves is always higher than the value of their
debts to depositors. It is true that they don't have the value of all
their assets on hand to give to creditors if they demand it, but then
again you probably don't have all your assets in a liquid form either.
The second magical leap you make here is that this is somehow
inflationary, which of course it isn't.
It is true enough that the total sum of demand deposits exceeds the
total value of outstanding currency. So what?
You are correct that the fed creates and destroys money. You are not

are M1, M2, M3...
If you meant the activities of banks lead to expansion of the amount
of demand deposits in the world, yes, you are correct. However, at no
time do commercial banks loan out money that they do not have on
hand. If they give you a loan for $100, they have $100 available and
they can expect that if you don't deposit the $100 with them, that
they will have the $100 to give to the bank that you deposit the check
in. Now, because of fractional reserve banking, a bank will only have
a fairly small percentage of deposits in cash, but that is different
from a bank loaning out money that it doesn't have or creating
money. Only the fed gets to create money.

No it wouldn't. There is a tiny but nonzero probability that xoring
your one time pad with your text will result in a cyphertext equal to,
say, the Bible. Big deal. If the key is really random, the
cryptanalyst has no way to tell what the underlying text was.
There is only one context in which things are compressable or not --
is there a smaller representation for them.
True enough, but the claim was that a random string has no
representation which is smaller than itself.

If the text of Hamlet were produced by a truly random number
generator, then it would make a fine one time pad. A cryptanalyst
seeing patterns in it would have no way of knowing that the patterns
were caused by the input being "Hamlet" -- he would have no way to
demonstrate that just because the first five hundred words of the key
appear to have been "Hamlet" that the rest would be -- and indeed,
there would be far more cases where the rest wouldn't be. If, on the
other hand, what you are doing is using books as keys for ciphers,
then "Hamlet" is a very poor one.
IF you are using a one time pad system that truly has a random source
of keying material, AND the 1 in 2^1460536 event of the key being
Hamlet occurred, THEN no, you aren't likely to get broken. Note that
the probability of having this happen is astronomically low, but then
again, the probability of ANY given one time pad being generated is
astronomically low. If you are just picking books off the shelf and
playing one time pad with them, yes, you are correct, you will likely
be broken.
I don't think you are considering this clearly.
It is far, far more probable for the cryptanalyst, thinking the
key was "Hamlet", to get out a plausible but totally bogus text, than
it is for the key to actually be "Hamlet". Of course, it is also far,
far more probable for you to be stupid than for a random number
generator to put out "Hamlet", but if you go around getting rid of
RNGs that produce "Hamlet" or anything close, you have in theory given
information to the attacker that gives them a slightly better chance
of attacking you since your pads are no longer purely random.
The reason all this isn't stupid to discuss and actually has some
importance is just this fact. If you build a system that discards
things that "don't look like they have enough entropy" (which certain
people around here have proposed), you are giving the cryptanalyst a
very strong piece of information about the key, so your key is no
longer totally unpredictable. An irony, but something important to
keep in mind. Every once in a while (once in every four billion bits,
or so) your random number generator will put out 32 1's in a row if it
is functioning properly. Any given small segment of the output of a
good RNG might not look "random", but "random" isn't a property of a
given number -- it is the property of the infinite sequence itself.

Unfortunately, I think his filter puts too high a bound on the

spinners as RNGs, which I have a substantial fear of.
However, you are correct that this mechanism is no worse than not

If what you want to do is run a distributed ray tracer, and sell the
cycles for it, you can run an ordinary executable on a machine with an
unusual kernel. If, for example, you could completely revoke access to
the bulk of system calls and only permit I/O to a small number of
inherited file descriptors, you could probably manage to get a
reasonable engineering solution in place that would be suitable solely
for things like markets in CPU cycles. I could probably design such an
execution environment in a few weeks. Such an execution environment
radically differs from Java in so far as it has a "what is not
expressly permitted is forbidden" strategy all the way down to the
kernel interface. It might still be dangerous in the presence of
things like kernel bugs that permit you to write arbitrary memory
addresses, however. My suspicion is that something thats okay from an
engineering standpoint should be possible.
What you are saying, Marianne, is that you work for the Java group at

Don't take this the wrong way, Tim, but you have totally
misinterpreted the position many of us who dislike Java take. You
completely mischaracterize our attitude.
There are two philosophies in opposition here, the optimistic
model versus the realistic model.
1) "We are smart, so we simply build something that feels good and
   provided we can't find a way to break it we declare it secure."
   This is the Java model. Java isn't "scruffy". Its a very elegant
   and cleanly built system, far more elegant than most. I contend
   that it is flawed, but not because it is "scruffy". I contend that
   the flaw is that its security depends on all its parts working
   flawlessly, and that we can't build flawless systems. Such systems
   are made on the liberal assumption that humans can design something
   perfect in all its parts. To trust a system built on such an
   assumption, you ultimately need a proof of its security from top to
   bottom. The very reason I think such a system is impractical is
   that I agree with the notion that such proofs are not possible or
   if they are made are often as buggy as the code was, proofs merely
   being a formalism in a different language. This is the wrong
   paradigm, from the start.
2) "We are ignorant, so we build something that does as little as we
   can get away with, makes the assumption at every stage that every
   component of the system might be broken, and put seventeen layers
   of armor around it on the assumption that we still have probably
   made a mistake or two in designing the system." This is the model
   that modern firewalls built by the likes of me take -- systems that
   are designed to be tolerant of multiple engineering failures. Such
   systems are built on the assumption that humans are fallible. Such
   systems, unlike Java, do not depend on flawless operation of all
   their components for their security. Such systems are built on the
   conservative assumption that humans are going to make mistakes and
   that you have to take account of your own fallibility when
   designing secure systems. In such a system, one can have breeches
   of the security of four major subsystems and the fifth still keeps
   you alive. The "belt and suspenders" model doesn't require
   mathematical proofs of security because it was engineered, from the
   start, to be robust.
Tim misunderstands, thinking this is a case of some foolish
perfectionists getting mad at the guys who throw things together and
hope that they work. Not at all. Our problem with Java is the security
model, which inherently requires perfect design and operation. We
build our own systems to be robust enough to survive our own mistakes.
Java is built such that any mistake is fatal.
Essentially, this is the optimists versus the realists.
PS BTW, Tim, Java is great for the theorem prover fetishizers -- look no
further than Java's bytecode verifier. I have never built a system
that required an "active defense" like that. They fill me with the
same sort of dread I would get from a skyscraper design that required
a constant flow of electricity to the building lest it collapse. Sure,
its cool. Maybe it even saves some money. However, can you sleep at

It is difficult. The way Java does this, with the protection relying

So, yes, if you are going to create a product that everyone on earth
has to be able to use, it had damn well not explode in your face every

most people don't expect that sort of behavior in a friendly consumer
appliance that nice people from Sun and Netscape guarantee is
absolutely positively safe except for all the bugs.
It costs all the same things the the firewalls are protecting.
No one. Unfortunately, when the same machine runs Netscape so the
trader can read the UUNet/MFS merger press release and also has the
big shiny red "trade!" button on some application, you get nervous.
As I said, the traders don't expect that their phone will explode when
they pick it up, or that every piece of literature they get in the
mail may be coated with contact poison. Well, Java is a silent
killer. It soon is going to be sitting on every desktop at every

also sitting on all those PCs running "Quicken" that helpfully now can
do direct electronic funds transfer from your account, etc. If you
don't care about the security of your bank account, well, sure, you
have nothing to worry about.
In short, my clients need security today. Your home computer probably
needs it soon if not now, and if you think your business can survive a

Its not Java crashing that I worry about. Its everything else on the

Well, sorry, you try to keep it off the desks in the banking industry

No, but you could die if someone gets your toaster to catch fire, or
gets your microwave oven to do something the hardware wasn't supposed

No, but supporting censorship is.
Or, perhaps, that I'm not impressed by opportunistic newcomers with

It is neither elite nor secret. It is fairly high signal to noise. I

You have no right to grumble about the situation here. It is exactly
what you wanted. Here you were, a person of some personal gravitas and
moral authority, and you put your stamp on the "post whatever you
like; don't let the grumbling censors stop you". Well, as you sow, so
shall you reap. Its your fault, more than anyone else's.
Unfortunately, most of the smart coders had been driven out of this
cesspit by the noise levels, so it was the only choice left.
Actually, it isn't easier. I've tried filtering cypherpunks and its
damn hard. Doing it right would require much more AI than we have
access to.
As I recall, Mr. May, you were arguing against my continued attempts
to keep some semblance of technical discussion continuing on
Cypherpunks. The occassional attempt by me to turn things in a
technical direction was met by posts from you to the effect of "this
isn't coderpunks, get that technical stuff out of here". In jest or
no, I got sick of dealing with it.
I didn't want to see the split, but at least now there is a place I
can have discussions with smart crypto software coders. None of them
could tolerate Cypherpunks any longer. If Cypherpunks has become a

     OPEN LETTER TO THE INTERNET COMMUNITY
     May 2, 1996
     Dear friends:
     As an Internet user, you are no doubt aware of some of the hurdles the      federal government has put up that limit the growth and full potential      of exciting, emerging technologies.  One of the most egregious of      these has been the governmentally set limits on so-called "encryption"      technologies.  Today I am introducing a bill to address this major      problem for businesses and users of the Internet.      If the telecommunications law enacted this year is a vehicle to      achieve real changes in the ways we interact with each other      electronically, my bill is the engine that will allow this vehicle to      move forward.  The bill would promote the growth of electronic      commerce, encourage the widespread availability to strong privacy and      security technologies for the Internet, and repeal the out-dated      regulations prohibiting the export of encryption technologies.
     This legislation is desperately needed because the Clinton      administration continues to insist on restricting encryption exports,      without regard to the harm this policy has on American businesses'      ability to compete in the global marketplace or the ability of      American citizens to protect their privacy online.  Until we get the      federal government out of the way and encourage the development of      strong cryptography for the global market, electronic commerce and the      potential of the Internet will not be realized.
     The last thing the Net needs are repressive and outdated regulations      prohibiting the exports of strong privacy and security tools and      making sure that the government has copies of the keys to our private      communications.  Yet this is exactly the situation we have today.
     My new bill, the Promotion of Commerce On-Line in the Digital Era      (Pro-CODE) Act of 1996, would:
     - Allow for the unrestricted export of "mass-market" or      "public-domain" encryption programs, including such products as Pretty      Good Privacy and popular World Wide Web browsers.
     - Require the Secretary of Commerce to allow the unrestricted export      of other encryption technologies if products of similar strength are      generally available outside the United States.
     - Prohibit the federal government from imposing mandatory key-escrow      encryption policies on the domestic market and limit the authority of      the Secretary of Commerce to set standards for encryption products.
     Removing export controls will dramatically increase the domestic      availability of strong, easy-to-use privacy and security products and      encourage the use of the Internet as a forum of secure electronic      commerce. It will also undermine the Clinton Administration's      "Clipper" proposals which have used export restrictions as leverage to      impose policies that guarantee government access to our encryption      keys.
     The Pro-CODE bill is similar to a bill I co-authored with Senator      Patrick Leahy of Vermont, except that it highlights the importance of      encryption to electronic commerce and the need to dramatically change      current policy to encourage its growth.  My bill does not add any new      criminal provisions and does not establish legal requirements for      key-escrow agents.
     Over the coming months, I plan to hold hearings on this bill and      encourage a public debate on the need to change the Clinton      Administration's restrictive export control policies.  I will need      your support as we move forward towards building a global Internet      that is good for electronic commerce and privacy.  I look forward to      working with the Internet community, online activists, and the      computer and communications industry as this proposal moves through      Congress.
     I'd like to hear from you, so please join me on two upcoming online      events to talk about the new bill.  The first is on America Online in      the News Room auditorium at 9 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on May 6.       The second will be on Hotwired's Chat at 9 p.m. EDT on May 13.
     In the meantime, I need your help in supporting the effort to repeal      cryptography export controls.  You can find out more by visiting my      web page   There you will find a      collection of encryption education resources that my Webmaster has      assembled.  I trust that the entire Internet community, from the      old-timers to those just starting to learn about encryption, will find      this information useful.
     This bill is vital to all Americans, from everyday computer users and      businesses to manufacturers of computer software and hardware.  I very      much look forward to working with you on this issue.

     United States Senator

I would like to re-emphasize that given its design, Java was, if
anything, created by "neats". The problem is that its model requires
perfection to assure security, instead of conservative design which
assumes there may be design flaws and produces "defense in depth".

At one of my clients, there is a software testing lab where all
software that is placed on the trading floor is rigorously tested for
months before it is put out on the users desktop -- it is, indeed,
tested in conjunction with all other products the user would be
using. No software is deployed before rigorous testing occurs. By the
time the thing is put out, it is known to a high degree of certainty
that it will not cause damage.
This wasn't even something I requested -- they had this in place
before I got there. This isn't that unusual on Wall Street, either --
I know of a number of firms with similar "integration labs", "test
labs", etc.
Netscape with Java cannot be so tested because important components
come down off the net.  So no, I'm not holding Netscape with Java to a
higher standard. I'm very much holding it to the same standard.

I believe that it is possible to design environments in which you can
safely run applet like things. However, 1) I am not sure that such an
environment is needed for most of what Java does in the Netscape
environment, so given the dangers I'm not sure the price is worth
paying, 2) Java does not possess the characteristics such an
environment needs, and 3) It is pretty clear that much of what the
Java designers want to do could not be done in such an environment.
I would very much prefer a language who's security did not require
such analysis. Java, sadly, does require such an analysis because it
requires perfect implementation for its security model to work. In a
restricted execution environment that was designed with defense in
depth in mind, such an analysis would be a bonus, but not strictly

I would answer Tim, but I suspect that he would ignore something I

   Perhaps you think your E-mail is legitimate enough that encryption is
   unwarranted.  If you really are a law-abiding citizen with nothing to
   hide, then why don't you always send your paper mail on postcards?    Why not submit to drug testing on demand?  Why require a warrant for
   police searches of your house?  Are you trying to hide something?    You must be a subversive or a drug dealer if you hide your mail
   inside envelopes.  Or maybe a paranoid nut.  Do law-abiding citizens
   have any need to encrypt their E-mail?
   What if everyone believed that law-abiding citizens should use
   postcards for their mail?  If some brave soul tried to assert his
   privacy by using an envelope for his mail, it would draw suspicion.    Perhaps the authorities would open his mail to see what he's hiding.    Fortunately, we don't live in that kind of world, because everyone
   protects most of their mail with envelopes.  So no one draws suspicion
   by asserting their privacy with an envelope.  There's safety in
   numbers.  Analogously, it would be nice if everyone routinely used
   encryption for all their E-mail, innocent or not, so that no one drew
   suspicion by asserting their E-mail privacy with encryption.  Think
   of it as a form of solidarity.
Never thought I would see the day where Tim stopped being a
Cypherpunk. Everyone mark your calendars.

It certainly makes me feel more comfortable. The problem I have is
that I expect that increasingly pages will arise for which information

Foo Corporation's merger press release because we won't run some
program! Thats bullshit! Do you know how much money the risk arb desk
pulls in, you twit! This must never happen again! Fix it immediately!"
Luckily things aren't quite at that stage yet, but its only a matter
of time. When you create a tool like this, you have a certain degree
of, dare I say it, community responsibility. Once you've hyped the
tool enough and made it ubiquitous, people at some point are going to
claim that they *need* it, at which point the security people have no
choice but to do something that gives them nightmares.

What, like the one we live in NOW?
As I said, things have gotten steadily worse since Horace Mann
invented the modern government socialization institution we call the
"public school". (It was originally created to force the horrible
subhuman Irish and Germans to send their kids to places where good
protestant values would be inculcated into them, not as a way to
increase the literacy rate. Check on your own if you don't believe
Every year since World War II, expenditures in real dollars have
increased per pupil at the government schools. Every year, average
class size has gone down in the government schools. Indeed, year after
year, the demands of the education mafia are always met. Who, after
all, would dare deny anything to the poor children.
Of course, almost every year, educational quality has declined.
Has it occurred to you that something is probably wrong with your
world model when in spite of the fact that everything the education
mafia asks for is granted they can't deliver the goods?
Maybe if New York City spends $20,000 a year per student instead of
the $10,000 they spend now things will get better? One wonders why the
parochial schools get away with spending only $2500 and yet deliver a
better education.
I learned to read outside of school. I realize I had a privileged
background -- my parents being literate and all -- but in fact I'll
note that my parents claim that they didn't teach me to read, the
goddamnoisybabblebox did. One day I just started reading at them and
they were shocked as could be.
Perhaps its this sort of thing, and the fact that the literacy rate
was higher BEFORE public education, that lead me to believe that we
don't need any more "assistance" from the friendly neighborhood
government. We need less, a lot less, and as fast as possible.
I agree that it is bad that some people do not know how to read, but
the cost is mostly paid for by them except when society decides to
"help the unfortunate". Even then, it is the illiterate who can't get
a job, not me. Literacy is a private good, not a public good.
If you would like to see an improvement in literacy I therefore have a
simple solution. Eliminate public schools. The literacy rate has been
in steady decline since Horace Mann's lovely innovation. With only
private schools available, teachers will live in terror of being fired
for being ineffective. Schools that don't teach children the skills
their poor parents scrimp and save for will lose their
students. Incompetant fools will no longer be tolerated. The schools
will cease to spend time teaching random socialist fluff and will
become businesses hired to inculcate skills like reading, mathematics
and reasoning ability -- or they will be fired.
I live in hope that some day schools will be forced to go begging for
students, and will find themselves faced with questions like "if
Johnson Elementary across town can teach my kid for $500 less a year
and teach him to read a year earlier in a safer environment, why the
hell should I pay incompetant dweebs like you?" I long for the day
when Albert Shanker and the entire teachers union hierarchy is forced
to sweep streets for lack of any other job that anyone will offer
So, yes, I want to see education improved. The answer in my mind is to
fire the entire government.
Housing is of paramount importance to society. Do you feel that you
would like to live in government housing projects over a privately
owned apartment?
Food is of paramount importance to society. Why do we have no
government run feeding stations to replace these evil supermarkets,
Heat is of paramount importance to society -- in New England you can't
survive the winter without it. Why, then, do we not have government
operated and financed oil companies to replace the evil private ones.
Communications are of primary importance to society. Would you swap
our phone system for the phone system in Greece, or even the one in
France, which are publically subsidized and run by the government?
Do you prefer using the U.S. Postal Service, or Federal Express when
you absolutely positively have to get the package there?
If you had a choice, would you go to a V.A."hospital" or see a private
In short, why do you think the government, which fucks* up everything
it touches, and which has controlled education for a century, is the
answer to fixing the education problem, when it so obviously is the
CAUSE of the education problem?

Actually, I believe most people on this list argue for no government
or so little that its decisions hardly matter.

Sounds like the usual fixed point hack used for manipulating and
storing money. Most systems I've seen use things like this.
Floats have all sorts of defects, like not conveniently indicating to
you the point at which they start dropping precision. A float doesn't
care that it just started dropping vast amounts of the precision in
some calculation where you are unfortunate enough to have done the
order of operations wrong. At that point, a hack will have kept its
precision or will indicate overflow, but floats blythely keep on
going. This leads to very unpleasant problems down the road.

The MBONE experimentor referred to in the story was Van Jacobson at the Lawrence Berkeley Labs.  I followed this up since receiving
much interested mail responses.   I called Van Jacobson himself at the Lab (the web is a wonderful thing!), and found that the story was embellished.
The real event as told by Van Jacobson was:
   'MBONE software was at one time accidentally compiled with    links into libraries which contained DES, and someone (I    don't remember who) noticed the DES capability in our MBONE    binaries, and informed the group about the encryption export    problem.  The problem was promptly fixed.'

Frankly, I really dislike the idea of my users downloading arbitrary

sure it really buys you too much, either, other than loss of security.
Lots of things are useful. Security often "gets in the way". However,
as mature engineers operating in an environment where many users have
highly mission critical equipment, some of us try to be more
responsible than that.
Java's security has always lacked defense in depth, continues to lack
defense in depth, probably cannot be retrofitted to gain defense in
depth, and is likely going to continue to be periodically
penetrated. Java security continues to rely on the "all portions of
the system are perfectly implemented" model, which as I have
repeatedly noted in this forum is fundamentally flawed because humans
can never produce perfectly designed and implemented systems. A system
that was built to be failure tolerant would be better, but that isn't

I'd like to state, for the record, that I have nothing against the

well and aren't in on some evil plot. However, that doesn't make Java
a good idea.
For at least twenty or more years, people have known that for the
ultimate in multimedia email or what have you all you would need to do
is make the recipient execute a program that you sent them. This
obviates all the questions of having to figure out what sort of things
you would want to send -- if you can execute a program, you can do
anything. Unfortunately, this is also so phenomenally obvious a
security problem that no one ever proposed it as anything more than a
joke -- until now.
Sun is, unfortunately, suffering from a substantial hubris problem. As
I have noted, the original Java applet security model and all the
followups have had exactly the same problem -- they depend on perfect
implementation of every element of the security model for the security
to work, instead of having the realistic and conservative assumption
that portions of the model will be misimplemented, and designing for
defense in depth.
Beyond that, however, they have created the ultimate hype
monster. Java is a neat idea looking for a good application. I use the
web all day long and I have yet to see a good use for Java. We have,
essentially, mortgaged our system security for almost nothing better
than the occassional gee whiz animation that could have been
implemented with a safe graphics description format instead of a
turing equivalent language.
Again, I don't hate the Sun people or hold any animosity towards
them. However, I will point out the lesson that any good student of

Very little. However, there would be a noticable shift in the price of

to get at the inside information, so the pool of suspects would be
small (usually on the order of a dozen people or less), and if you,

In other words, anonymity works better when the "crime" isn't visible

Sun, Netscape, and Oracle have been sent details of the problem (which is

separates JVM classes into different namespaces.
Using this bug, an attacker can bypass all of Java's security
restrictions. This includes executing native code on the client, with
the same permissions as the user of the browser. No preconditions are
necessary other than viewing the attacker's web page, and the process
can be made completely invisible to the victim.

Phill, quit while you are ahead. It is my opinion, as a person highly

were impossible to achieve by any means other than fraud, and that no
honest broker would have allowed her to hold positions in which she
was so far out of mandatory margin requirements and a trivial move
would have wiped out her entire net worth and more.  I do not know of
a single professional in the industry who disagrees with me.
I know of at least one extremely well written study, by Victor
Neiderhoffer (a very successful futures trader) and Caroline Baum (a
reporter for Telerate) that more or less demonstrates that there is no
way that any of what happened could have been legitimate.
The most astounding part of the trading pattern was that Hillary
Clinton did not "let it ride" and earn the money off of repeated
increases in the value of a single investment -- instead, she took all
profits out of her account after each trade and never invested more
than a tiny sum in any transaction. That is to say, she didn't earn
modest profits repeatedly over many trades -- she earned nearly
impossible profits in trade after trade. In spite of withdrawing her
profits after each trade, she racked up an impossible profit of 100
times her initial investment in a tiny period of time. At no time did
she meet margin requirments, and she repeatedly risked more than the
Clinton's entire net worth on what would have been gambles had her
profits not been guaranteed. In spite of her astounding "performance"
she immediately stopped trading after $100,000 in profits had been
There is an obvious trick by which this can be achieved. The broker
writes two tickets -- one to buy, one to sell. One ticket always loses
exactly what the other gains. The winning ticket is assigned to the
bribee, the loser to the person doing the bribing. The mechanism
self-launders the funds.
Mr. Baker, she traded FUTURES.
Margin requirements are set by the exchanges and the CFTC, not by the
broker in most cases. They are required by law -- not under broker

I don't think you get it.
Its one thing to put up $1000, make $4000, then put up the $5000 and
make $10,000 with it, etc. Thats a situation where you are compounding
your profits -- reinvesting them.
Its another thing to put up $1000, make $4000, withdraw the $4000, put
up $1000, make $4500, withdraw the $4500, etc.
This is not a case of someone making a profit and reinvesting it so
that she got compound returns. This is a case of someone miraculously
turning one in a million trades over and over and over again on the
same tiny stake until she got $100,000. Its almost impossible to turn
$1000 into $100,000 by reinvesting. Its dead impossible the way that
Hillary did it.
Neiderhoffer and Baum list about a dozen criteria for detecting fraud
in securities transactions like this. Hillary Clinton hits every
single one. She was a first time trader. She took gigantic risk. Her
account was full of large scale irregularities like failure to meet
margin requirments. She earned astounding profits. She was in a
position to be bribed. She made her money off leverage in tiny
movements that would be hard to impossible for people to exploit. She
stopped trading just as suddenly as she started in spite of her
miraculous success. You can read Neiderhoffer and Baum's article
yourself if you like.
I will state this for the record: Having examined the evidence, I
would say that even a non-expert who was reasonably informed about how
the futures markets work would have no choice but to conclude that
Hillary Clinton's trading pattern was impossible without some sort of
fraud being committed.
Huh? What are you talking about?
Futures contracts aren't an "underwriting" in any case. They are very
simple contracts. When you buy a futures contract in, say, feeder
cattle, you are buying delivery of a fixed size number of feeder
cattle on a particular date in the future. When you sell a contract,
you are agreeing to deliver that many cattle. Thanks to margin, of
course, by putting up a fairly small sum of money you can buy control
over a large number of cattle, and not have to actually put up most of
the money.
One major problem with Hillary Clinton's fraudulent trades, however,
was that she was buying enough contracts that a tiny shift in the
price of the cattle downward -- shifts of a size that would be common
in a given day -- would have more than wiped out her families entire
net worth and more. Somehow, though, her broker allowed her to take
such large positions -- without putting up the *legally*required*
margin -- and somehow in lots of trades a statistically ordinary
blip never hit her.

crisis, would be willing to gamble her family's entire future over and
over again -- unless, of course, it wasn't gambling.
Of course they would. Sadly, however, the broker in question
conveniently lost ALL RECORDS OF TRANSACTIONS THAT TOOK PLACE AT THAT
TIME. Sad, isn't it?
This same broker was censured repeatedly for violating securities
laws, by the way.
Does the word "coverup" mean anything to you?
Both of those are visible. This is invisible.
The trick was very common at the time, a fact that all your brilliant
friends you consulted didn't seem to know. Many brokers got snagged,
along with their clients, in pulling this game for all sorts of
reasons -- shifting assets from a taxable account held by a client
into their tax free pension account, for example. The SEC, CFTC and
IRS caught on, and the practice has been largely wiped out. Matched
trades were common, however, in the period we are talking about, and
many brokers did in fact perform them for clients.
I must confess that I don't know, largely because its irrelevant, even
in this case.
Of course they were. They just can't be proven.
We are not dealing with some idiot like Spiro T. Agnew here. We are
talking about a pair of well educated, very smart and totally
unscrupulous crooks -- Bill and Hillary Clinton. There is no evidence
that you can pin on them in court. However, I'm not a court, and I'm
allowed to judge something to have been impossible to achieve without
hanky panky regardless of whether or not you can prove who the
counterparty is and why the bribe was made.

I realized that there was an ambiguity in my last missive. I'd like to
close that ambiguity.
If you meant "brokers have to put up the margin, not customers, and
they don't have to charge customers the margin" you were simply flat
out wrong. Margin is a customer responsibility, not a broker
responsibility. I will point out, though, that brokers face liability
if their customers cannot meet their obligations -- which naturally
would make any honest broker suspicious of a customer trading a highly
leveraged position in which a tiny move in the market would wipe out
the customer's entire net worth, thus likely exposing the broker to
substantial risk.
Stop loss orders, incidently, aren't any use if the damage would be
done before any such order could be executed.

I know the results. 99% of them laughed about the whole thing for
weeks. The poster caricature of Hillary Clinton with a crystal ball

particularly amusing.
The thing was a universal joke. I never heard anyone who would be
nicer than to say the whole thing was extremely suspicious.
Gee, Mr. Hallam-Baker, it seems your ignorance about what she was
trading (I believe you thought it was "options" before) also extends
to an ignorance about how the futures markets work or how securities
accounts work.
Making that kind of return in day trades in the cattle markets? You
out of your ever living mind?
Its not like there was even any basis for her trades that she could
articulate. Thats because the trades were made without any basis, in
matched pairs.
(By the way, learn what a contract is. A contract is not the same as a
trade. You are sounding thoroughly ridiculous.)
You ARE out of your ever living mind.
The average individual account holder at Refco "blows out" (that is,
loses their entire stake) within six months of opening their
account. Refco is one of the more reputable places to trade futures.
You are simply an ignoramous, talking totally outside your
league. Have you ever so much as bought a futures contract or an
options contract? Have you even ever opened a securities account?
Of course they know. There just isn't anything that can be done. There
is no proof. Its more or less as though one finds a man with gunpowder
stains on his hands, and a bullet embedded in the wall of his office
and human blood soaking the carpet. You can't prove that he killed
anyone. You can never get a conviction. But you can know.
Well, it was announced, and the media discussed it, and Hillary gave
her teary eyed press conference cynically wearing a matronly outfit,
and she gave her usual raft of "I cannot recalls" and "I don't
remembers" and given no additional evidence, the whole thing ended.
The fraud was in the ticket switching, so it makes no difference that
the margin requirements were not made.
The other crime was, of course, bribery. However, without records or
information, there is no way to prove any of it. The mere fact that
all the records from the brokerage were mysteriously destroyed should
make you wonder.
Switching the tickets was the fraud. Taking bribes was also a crime. I
have no concern as to whether the margin requirements issue was
criminal -- it was probably only a civil violation. In any case it
makes no difference -- there is more than enough crime here to go

My apologies. From now on I will refer to you solely as Dr. Phill
Hallam-Baker, PhD.
One doesn't "sign a futures" contract. The risk is also not always
open ended by any means. If I purchase 50 unleaded gasoline contracts,
my risk is strictly limited -- I cannot lose more than the value of
the gasoline, and that would only be if it became totally worthless
(an unlikely event). If I sell an uncovered contract, things are
different, of course. With options, if I buy puts or calls, again, my
risk is totally limited -- I cannot lose more than the cost of the
Er, no.
You have potentially unlimited reward in ANY purchase, and limited
risk. If I buy a box of cornflakes and next week cornflakes suddenly
become worth $1,000,000 a box, well, I've experienced reward, but my
risk was at most the cost of the cornflakes.
No, it isn't. If there is no body and no one knows who you have shot,
the rules of Corpus Delecti pretty much dictate that you aren't going
to jail. You cannot be charged with the murder of unknown persons when
there isn't even any evidence of what happened (it could very well
have been someone being accidently injured while you were showing off
your gun collection and they might have done just fine). You don't
even have to say what happened -- you are under no obligation to
testify, you know.
Now, your neighbors will probably talk badly of you forever, but you
won't be convicted of anything.
What documents can they subpoena? All of Hillary Clintons documents
are available. It is known what she traded and when. Without a witness
who will say who did the bribing, or broker records showing the
counterparty who was doing the bribing, nothing can be done.
You seem to assume that every crime in existance can be
prosecuted. They can't. Hillary Clinton can claim to be the victim of
a very odd set of circumstances, which is effectively what she has
done, and we have no way to put her in jail.
That doesn't mean, however, that we have to believe her.
Netscape options were not available at the time that the shorts got
hurt. Selling short is not a derivatives investment. You don't seem to
have much of a deep knowledge of these markets -- at the very least
you speak of them in a manner guaranteed to produce derision from
You are right. The human blood might have been from the blood bank,
and the bullet might have been an accident. Its fucking unlikely,
Correct. That is why Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton aren't in
jail. However, court proof and proof good enough for me aren't the
same thing.
They had a considerably smaller net worth at the time.
Most of the Clinton's net worth appears to have come from dirty
political dealings over the years -- things like the Cattle Futures
bribe laundry, Rose Law Firm overbillings or dealings with the
Arkansas state government, etc. Not a shred of it can be proven in
court, of course.
No one out there that I know of who does this for a living has ever
seen anyone make that much money in short term speculation that
way. George Soros, Paul Jones and all the rest would be envious of the
performance she had in the markets.
I don't know anyone who can articulate a theory of why the trades were
made when they were that comes from "astute thinking". They are
seemingly random. Thats probably because they WERE random.
As I've said, the evidence is compelling. It just isn't proof. Its
just like the bullet, the blood, and the powder burns on your
hands. No body and no missing person means no jail, but it doesn't
mean that one has to go about thinking what one is looking at is
perfectly innocent.
If this was Richard Nixon no one would be questioning what the money
I see no other explanation for what the money would have been. The
fact that her supposed advisor on these trades was the attorney for
Arkansas's most important company, Tyson Chicken, is a bit on the
suggestive side. Again, it is not proof, but proof isn't needed.
If you can find anyone on earth who can give that good a bunch of
advice, please let me know. Several hedge fund managers I work with
would probably pay me for their name.
I don't know anyone who has EVER performed that well in the
markets. Its nearly impossible.
Could you have made 100 to one on that in a couple of months, though?
Sure, its easy to make 20% or 30% on your money a year. Its hard, but
many people do it.
Making 10,000% in a few weeks is impossible.
They did for a while, but when it became obvious that the evidence was
not going to lead to the court room, it ended. Besides, most of the
media in Washington are registered Democrats. 89% of the Washington
press corps voted for Clinton from what I've read.
Your attitude seems to be "you can't prove anything so you must assume
that they are innocent." My attitude is "I can't prove anything so
they can't go to jail, but that doesn't mean I have to believe that
they are innocent -- in fact, I'm an idiot if I believe that."

Dr. Phill Hallam-Baker, PhD, seems to know even less about free market
environmentalism than he knows about futures and options.
Of course, what Dr. Phill Hallam-Baker, PhD, suggests is idiotic. As
any free market economist would tell you, the way to stop a resource
from being destroyed is not to pray that people won't buy it but to
assure that someone has an ownership stake in the resource, thus
assuring that their investment would be destroyed if the resource
vanished. Thats why, for instance, timber companies happily clear cut
government land that they have leased (after all, not clear cutting
would mean that they wouldn't extract maximum value for their lease
under the idiotic terms that the leases are made under) but will
almost never clear cut their own lands, because that would reduce
their long term value.
Dr. Phill Hallam-Baker, PhD, however, does not understand economics in
spite of his PhD and thus attributes views to free market economists
that they do not hold, as in his whole cloth synthesis of a viewpoint
which he ascribed to Milton Friedman which Milton Friedman would never
in a million years espouse.

If anyone wants to see real discussion of environmental issues with an

of, among others, Karl Hess Jr. (oh, and Dr. Phill Hallam-Baker, PhD

Only in some markets, but that doesn't matter. She had even less than
that on all of her trades, or didn't you pay any attention, Dr. Phill
Hallam-Baker, PhD. You should have been able to figure that out from

worth of cattle with a $1000 investment she couldn't possibly have
wiped out her net worth on a single transaction. Control hundreds of
thousands or millions of dollars worth of cattle, however, and a
sneeze in the marketplace will cost a pretty penny.

No modern economist would claim that the market solution to preventing
a species from going extinct is for people not to buy it. Its one of
the msot idiotic statements I've heard in years. As a nobel prize

the public goods problem and I cannot believe he would ever make such
an inane statment, no matter what you claim.

with the longer gun. Of course, you prefer to use distortionary
language (like refering to carrying a rifle) to make things look
ridiculous when in fact non-silly alternatives are possible.
Since you are either misreporting or inventing the comments you
attribute to Friedman and can neither cite the actual article nor

       We believe so. Unlike other encryption software, SafE Mail,
       through its proprietary encryption algorithm, leaves neither a
       backdoor nor a master key for any third party decryption of an
       encrypted file. To achieve extra security, SafE Mail allows an

information theory dictates that any system other than a one time pad
can in theory be broken by brute force once you have ciphertext longer
than the unicity distance, which is typically quite short. Unicity
distance depends only on the redundancy of the language and the key
length in bits (well, technically, the base two log of the number
possible keys, but they are usually the same for conventional
cryptosystems -- it would make a difference for stuff like RSA but

  of an IETF Working Group.
  The IESG contact persons are Harald Alvestrand, Keith Moore, and Jeff

Technical Summary
  This document describes how Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) can be used to

  raise any significant issues.
Protocol Quality
  This document was reviewed for the IESG by Jeffrey I. Schiller. The
  protocol provides for an elegant way of encapsulating PGP objects
  within a MIME framework by making use of Security Multiparts for MIME
  (RFC1847). This  permits a MIME aware user agent to read  and process
  PGP  signed and/or encrypted messages, yet it provides sufficient
  backwards compatibility for users with non-MIME aware mail user
  agents to make use of PGP directly to manually process messages

I believe that is "cracked" under most definitions of cryptographic
hashes, Mr. Ogren. A cryptographic hash is supposed to be useable in a
signature precisely because it is supposed to be computationally
infeasable to find two documents with the same hash. Whether both
documents are chosen by the attacker or only one is immaterial -- the
property as stated is independant of that. As things stand, you can
get someone to sign a contract saying "I agree to pay David F. Ogren
$100" and turn it into one saying "I agree to pay David F. Ogren
$2395.39" or some such. If that isn't "cracked" what would be
"cracked"? Yes, it could be worse, but is this not far more than bad

No, he doesn't. Dobbertin's privately circulated document is entitled
"Cryptanalysis of MD5", not "Possible weaknesses in MD5". The MD4
results were even more damning. It is true that the attacks aren't
general, but they are bad enough that the key property of
cryptographic hashes -- that it is computationally infeasable to
produce two documents with the same hash (note that the property is
NOT that you cannot produce a document with the same hash as a
document selected by the opponent), has been broken. Chosen plaintext,
in particular, is completely broken.
Dobbertin explicitly says that although there is no reason to panic,
that MD5 is not to be trusted.
I quote from your quote of Dobbertin:
      5. My conclusions are: no reason for panic, but in future
      implementations better move away from MD5.
Yeah, like if you are looking for a wacky checksum and not a
cryptographic hash.
Look the point is that Ogren seems to think this is some sort of a
minor technicality and that we can safely ignore it most of the
time. Thats simply not prudent. Once you find that the key properties
of your cryptographic hash have fallen and you have to be
exceptionally careful about what you put through the hash lest an
attacker somehow influence it, you've lost the game. MD5 is no longer
trustworthy. I agree that one needn't run screaming in the streets,
but Ogren made it sound as though this wasn't a matter of
concern. Thats simply wrong. Saying that leads people to a completely

Ritalin is not a tranquilizer or anything like a tranquilizer. It is
an amphetamine -- it is a close chemical analog to speed and could
only be characterized as a tranquilizer by someone without any
knowledge of the drug or its effects. Most people would become very
"up" on the stuff, but it has a paradoxical, completely reverse effect
on some people who have problems with their dopamine/norephinepherine

Totally consistant. It is a person's own business, not a third party's

supposedly a libertarian and supposedly opposed to drug laws that
prohibit people from taking what they want when they want, or,
presumably, deciding for their children what they should be
consuming. He also supposedly thinks that people should keep their
nose out of the personal choices made by others, and gets downright
cantakerous when anyone voices the least opinion about how he runs his
life. However, if a family, with the willing consent of their child,
decides to make a choice about how to best watch out for the welfare
of their own child, Tim sanctimoniously chimes in, along with the rest

I mean, Tim would be offended if anyone told him what to take, but he
feels perfectly happy telling other people how to run THEIR lives.

educated opinion. Tim's opinion is, however, neither educated nor

applies to those who attempt to mind his business.
I'm consistant. Tim, and possibly you, are hypocrites.
You don't hear me giving it, do you?
Drugs are wonderful things at times. A dose of morphine a few times a
day can make the difference between unbearable pain and being able to
function. A tablet of common aspirin can utterly change your day from
an experience filled with headache to a productive and happy one. A
dose of any one of several antidepressants can take people who have
repeatedly attempted suicide and at the very least give them enough
time to work out their problems and learn to deal with life.
Of course, drugs can also be damaging. One tablet of Tylenol is not so
bad. 100 destroy your liver. An occassional drink rarely hurts. Being
falling down drunk at all times is unlikely to improve your life.
Drugs are sometimes of use, sometimes not of use. Any use has to be
evaluated by the person contemplating taking the drug. Any mixed

There are people out there who are desperately unhappy. They can't

the least scared of cleaning their homes, except for the fact that
they are frightened of the fact that they can't manage to do it no
matter what they try. They'd like to pay the light bill -- really --
but every time they start they get distracted, or they get distracted
before they start. Sometimes they get bursts of hyperconcentration and
they can work for two days straight on some project, and they end it
and realize that the phone's been cut off because they completely
spaced dealing with it or anything else. Sometimes they feel very
pissed off because people tell them to just "apply themselves" more or
"manage their time" better or "get a more motivating job".
Such people aren't upset that life has lost its meaning. They are
often perfectly intelligent, capable of being happy in their pursuits,
and not bad individuals. They suffer, however, from an inability to
keep from twitching. They ritualistically play with common objects --
rubber bands, paperclips, etc, folding and unfolding them, winding and
unwinding them, etc. You can spot them -- they're the people who even

The abuse of psychiatry as an instrument of opression is not new, of
course. The Soviet Union used it regularly.
However, if anything, Ritalin gives a person with ADD the tools with
which to more effectively subvert authority. Its very hard to smash
the state, or even plot to get even with your boss, when you can't
concentrate sufficiently to execute your plans. It may be true that
someone will be less likely to impulsively act out against authority
under its influence, but such impulses rarely actually produce any
sort of lasting impact -- they only get one in trouble. By contrast,
effective subversion requires patience and self discipline, which is
precisely what an ADD sufferer does not have.
In short, if one really was trying to narcotize a troublemaker,
tranquilizers and the like are probably far better than Ritalin and
other amphetamines, which, in spite of Tim's pronouncements, do not
act as tranquilizers.
Actually, some ADD sufferers actually need less medication with time,
as the ability to concentrate for prolonged periods gives them the
chance to work on non-drug based coping strategies which are difficult
to work on without the meds.

Luckily, after the revolution, the private sector will open centers to

I'm not entirely sure. It is certainly bigger than the factorings that

together the experiment, and there are an awful lot of idle machines
out there in the world. I have on several occassions been in
possession of four or five hundred idle CPUs at night, and I am pretty
sure that other people are in that position. The net has also grown
quite dramatically in recent years, and reaching 100,000 reasonably
high speed machines might not be so hard these days. At that point, it
becomes a question of how fast one can get the DES cracker. A constant
factor of two or three then makes a considerable difference in the
outcome, as does the user friendlyness of the overall system.

No one claimed that you can't increase productivity and income on

underlying mechanisms are. Prices, including the price of labor, are
set purely by the marketplace. Under some circumstances, incomes will
be determined by investment levels made by employers. Under others,
they will not.  The important feature is the market principle, not the
capital investment. The point of my "green pylons" posting was to note
that it is the market direction of the investment and not the
investment that is important. Impediments to trade create wastes of
capital just as surely as burning cash in the marketplace does. If you

Yup. This is a frequently missed point. Link security and object

Thats just plain wrong.
Some block ciphers are highly resistant. Some block ciphers crack open
like eggs. Being a "block product cipher" doesn't in any way make you
"highly resistant to all forms of cryptographic attack".
The principle in the modern world of crypto is that your cipher must
be resistant to attack even if the attacker knows all details of it.
Furthermore, the principle in buying crypto is to know that 99% of
crypto on the market is junk, and that if you can't find out how it
works its probably not any good at all.

How do you manage to determine where you are losing bandwidth using
traceroute? That must be a mighty powerful traceroute to do that --
most traceroutes I've seen are hard pressed just to find out what the
connectivity path is.
Always the case. Big deal. Bandwidth is still increasing pretty
fast. There are, naturally, growing pains, but the outages and
bandwidth situation are pretty good, all things considered. Compared
to the way things were eight or nine years ago they are amazing;
compared to four years ago they are still astoundingly better.
Now if we could only go back in time and shoot the folks responsible
for HTTP before they thought of it we might even be able to do
something about the packet loss situation -- if HTTP just played nice
with TCP and Netscape didn't spawn simultaneous TCPs the situation
would be much improved.

there was...
Look, there will *always* be trouble. The question is whether or not
"collapse" is something imminent. The answer is "no". Stuff will get
better, it will get worse, but the overall trend is better, and
collapse just isn't in the cards.
Metcalfe talks about stupidity like how there aren't enough "suits"
running the net -- as though people in suits do better engineering
than the folks we've got. Metcalfe talks as though no one is trying to
fix the trouble. There already *are* people working hard trying to fix
the trouble, and they know a lot more than he does.
That doesn't tell you squat about bandwidth. At best, you can find a
really bad link that way, but there is no way to quantify the problem,
and no way to detect things like how much traffic is hitting that link.
The only way -- the ONLY way -- to determine link utilization from the
outside is with a management protocol like SNMP.

Shannon invented information theory in 1948 and 1949. Part of his

It is not possible.
The information content, or entropy, of the key stream is necessarily
no larger than its keyspace. That is, if you have a software
pseudo-random number generator using an N bit seed, the entropy of the
keyspace is necessarily never greater than N. This is mathematically
certain -- no amount of prayer on your part can change that.
Sorry, its even better -- a MATHEMATICAL fact.
von Neumann meant any deterministic algorithm, actually.
If it is a PRNG, you do not have a One Time Pad, period. What you have
is a stream cipher.
Furthermore, past examination has shown you have a POOR stream cipher.
If the entropy is limited, you do not have a One Time Pad, period, end

[Sorry that this is several weeks late, folks.]
"Cryptography" is a low-noise mailing list devoted to cryptographic
technology and its political impact.
WHAT TOPICS ARE APPROPRIATE:
  "On topic" discussion includes technical aspects of cryptosystems,
  social repercussions of cryptosystems, and the politics of
  cryptography such as export controls or laws restricting cryptography.
  Discussions unrelated to cryptography are considered "off topic".
  If you subscribe, please try to keep your postings "on topic". In
  order to assure that the quality of postings to the mailing list
  remains high, repeated postings "off topic" may result in action
  being taken by the list moderators.
MODERATION POLICY:
  In order to keep the signal to noise ratio high, the mailing list
  will be moderated during its initial weeks of operation. This will
  be changed if it appears that the list will remain on topic without
  moderation.
TO SUBSCRIBE: send mail to
     majordomo

My take on the licensing flame war:
I live in both Richard Stallman's world (the Open Source community)
and in the Cypherpunk crypto community.
The two have different goals. RMS is mistaken about appropriate
licensing for crypto code written by cypherpunks because he thinks the
goals are the same, when they are not.
The Open Source community seeks maximum spread of free software.
The Cypherpunk community seeks maximum spread of the use of non-GAKed
Some members of the Cypherpunk community are happy to have source
hoarders and such profit in any and all ways from the use of their
code *IF* it will spread the use of cryptography in the world. They
are willing to let anyone -- Microsoft, RMS, or anyone else -- use
their work, even in ways that do not further the objectives of the
Open Source community, provided it means more non-GAKed cryptography
is in use by more people.
The Open Source community obviously has different goals. It is seeking free software, not the wide spread of cryptography.
RMS is mistaking his goals for those of the cypherpunk
community. Their goals are not diametrically opposed, but they are not identical either, and so the sorts of licenses they may want to use
for the software they create are not necessarily the same.
EAY noted that he stopped distributing under GPL because *he*, the
author, wanted more people to be stealing his code, thus spreading
cryptography further. It wasn't a question of random people bitching
that the GPL didn't let them write proprietary software -- it was THE
AUTHOR OF THE CODE who wanted people to be able to write proprietary
software, because he felt that the goal of spreading crypto was more
important to him than the software freedom issue.
I am in no way saying RMS should stop using the GPL, or attempting to
say what sort of license is better for a particular author, but it
should be recognised that there are people who are happy having their
crypto routines stolen and incorporated into proprietary software --
who are, in fact, elated when this happens, because it means more
people will be using cryptographic software -- and that they might not
find the GPL to be ideal for their goal.

As a NetBSD developer, I'm quite familiar with other available
licenses, and in fact BSD license most of my source code because I
don't particularly mind if people use my code commercially -- I see
open source as a personal choice, and *my* source will remain open
regardless of whether or not others writing against my libraries keep
their source open.
I suppose my comments were a slight simplification of the situation,
but only slight. The open source community's goals and those of the
cypherpunk community, although not diametrically opposed, are not
identical, and it is important to keep that in mind when discussing
this matter. See below.
Understood -- my point was more that, to an open source person, GPL
and BSD licenses are both compatible with their goals, whereas to a
cyhpherpunk, the GPL is not compatible with their goals (or at least,
not always compatible with them.) This is because their goals are not
identical to those of an open source developer (although, once again,
they are not necessarily conflicting, either -- just different, which
leads to some open source licenses being inappropriate).
BTW, on the question of RMS's argument about whether the name "open
source" is appropriate, I think Shakespeare said it better than I can.

There are many layers of meaning. There is Juliet, a fictional
character, who means something, in saying what she said. There is
Shakespeare, the writer, who meant something in writing the play as he
did. Then there is Perry Metzger, who obviously meant something in
quoting Shakespeare putting words into Juliet's mouth.
As entertaining as literary deconstruction can be, what is
interesting here is not what Juliet meant, but what Perry Metzger
meant in quoting Juliet.

I find it exceptionally unlikely that many people are participating in
this. Whomever called the thing was not thinking very clearly. You
need at least several weeks notice for such a thing to work, and the
two or three days notice (at most) that was given was way too small. A
strike of this nature might work, but only if someone with political
sense were organizing it.
