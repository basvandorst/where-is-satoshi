Don't worry, "Janet Dove", or actually sanghi3 got mailbombed
severely for this one.  I'm just glad he doesn't know how to use remailers.

Calculating discrete logarithms is a bit more difficult than factoring.
So a 512-bit DH modulus will give you somewhat more security than a 512-bit
RSA key.  I'm not sure how much, probably not a lot.

[remainder of political rant deleted]
I got it too.  It was a pretty good forgery, but the web pages mentioned
seem to be owned by treborle  It looks like a hit-and-run spam,
as he hasn't logged in for awhile.  But since netcom charges for disk space,
I took the liberty of mailing him a few uuencoded core files. :)  You might
want to send a few to his compuserve address too for good measure. It looks like their web site  got taken out already, tho they
still have the netcom one.

@_subject: NoneMurder, Inc. (was "Deterrence") 
In reality, four million compuserve users would not donate a penny each.
It is likely that a few hundred people who felt strongly about
the cause (and didn't mind a little bloodshed) might be willing to put up
funds in amounts of around $20.  Of course nobody would want to advertise under their real name that they
have a contract out on some gummint agent.  This would require the
existance of a "Murder, Inc." as an escrow agent for the money.  (There
would likely be several such agents as it it unlikely people would trust
just one.)  Each person would give the escrow agent their contribution
toward the elimination of the gummint troublemaker.
Anyone who was willing to do the hit could post an encrypted claim, in
advance, stating the time and date or method he plans to use, and where to
send payment.  Once the act was done, the hitman posts the decryption key
so that everyone can see that he did it, and he collects the money.
If after some reasonable amount of time, nobody takes out the gubmint
asswipe, then the escrow agent returns all the money.
It's quite feasable, and not especially difficult.  The hardest thing is
convincing people that the escrow agent is trustworthy, and to convince
people that they really want to pay to have someone murdered.  There is
something a little chilling about that thought...  On the other hand, the
US government seems to feel that it's okay to kill people if they can get
away with it (Ruby Ridge, Waco, that guy in California (forgot his name)
who got shot on his ranch over bogus drug charges, etc.)  So although
murder is a Bad Thing(tm), the gubmint has set a very bad precedent in
making it look "okay".  Hence it becomes "okay" for people to do the same
to them (for example the recent Oklahoma incident).  It's okay for the
government to randomly pick on innocent people to make a statement, hence
it becomes okay to derail random trains to make a statement.  (For the
record, I am absolutely not defending what those people did to that Amtrak
train in Arizona, just pointing out the psycology of it.  If you're mad at
the government then fucking kill some government people - What the hell
did the amtrak passengers do to you?)  Unfortunately it seems to be becoming
okay to pick on random people to make an unrelated point (or just boost your
ego)  The government is using this tactic too, for example pick on a few
porno collectors to demonstrate your "authority" in cyberspace.  Same thing
with picking on random gun owners to make a statement against RKBA.  So
maybe it will become popular to kill a random politician (or anyone) just
to make a statement against the government.  This is turning into a rant.
I'll shut up now.

Since you are using Micro$oft Network, you must pay the extra 10% fee to
Bill Gates or he won't give you access to use the remailer.
Just kidding.  But seriously, if online time is so expensive that you don't
feel you can do a simple lycos.com search for "remailer", then you really
need to find a cheaper Internet service provider.
That said, point your web browser at the following:
And learn to use Lycos. :)

It's already happening anyway.  In a few years (if not today) Microsoft is
going to be hard pressed to come up with excuses why someone should pay $90
for Doze-95 when they can get a Linux CDROM for less than $20 (or ftp it
for free).  With WINE and DOSEMU, that Linux system will run most of the
same software too.  Willows software recently released their own windoze
emulator for Linux for practically nothing (there is a small fee for
commercial use, free otherwise).
Look at Netscape, giving away their browser for free and how Microsoft
finally gave in and did the same because they couldn't sell theirs.
Selling software is going to become practically impossible within a few
years, and prosecuting piracy will become even more fruitless.  Rather,
more and more companies will give the software away for free, and sell
their expertise.
Sure, they will still package it nicely in a box to sell it to corporate
types who are afraid of ftp, but what they're really selling is not the
software but the tech support number.  Anyone can get more software than
they will ever use from the various ftp sites.  Mr. Corporate Executive
doesn't want to waste his time checking out the latest offerings on the
net, but he will pay to have a reliable program delivered to him that
can be installed easily, by a company that will be happy to answer his
questions about it.
Companies like Red Hat and Walnut Creek are doing brisk business selling
cdroms full of software that you can get for free.  You can search the net
for interesting stuff for months on end, or you can get all the best stuff
on one disk from them for twenty bucks.
And look at Sun Microsystems - they're giving away all their software for
free.  But when someone wants a reliable network server, who are they
going to call?  Sun.  Software doesn't sell, but expertise does, and
giving away well-written software is an excellent way to demonstrate your
expertise to a large audience.
The concept of copyright is pretty much dead; the free market has invented
new solutions.
