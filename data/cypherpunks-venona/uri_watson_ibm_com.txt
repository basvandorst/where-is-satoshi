Please... I said: "It's as cumbersome, as one-time pad, but

one-time pad.

Then you're creating a sort-of one-time pad,  which you now
must convey securely to your correspondent. And this system
is still much less safe, than one-time pad, because of some
possible regularities in the lower bits (now I admit I know
very little of what such a recording would look like, so in

Well, of course one doesn't have to break RSA to get the _session_ key,
it would be enough to break IDEA, which will automatically deliver
