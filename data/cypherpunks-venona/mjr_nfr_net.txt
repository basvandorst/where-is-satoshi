The best countermeasure is to reduce its usefulness to law enforcement
by reducing its success rate. If there's enough press coverage of the
fact that the capability exists, then clueful crooks will not use
cell phones. Just like with escrowed crypto, you'll only catch the
really DUMB terrorists. All technology aside, the best way to make
progress in this area would be if the next James Bond movie shows
the capability being used. Then even clueless crooks and drug dealers
will do the equivalent of "gosh, well, I saw it on TV!" and will
believe the threat. Hmmmm.... Makes me think that a great way to make
progress is for cypherpunks to start submitting scripts to hollywood
about presidents who get in massive trouble when their personal
communications are subpoenaed and crypto keys are de-escrowed to
prove that they had sex with office staff....
Nah, that's too stupid...
