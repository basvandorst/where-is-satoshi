follow the convention is going to be stopped or losse there account (eg

I would argue that all cancels (not just 3rd party) should follow the
message id protocol.
This takes a little work,  you can't just reply to the email to get it in
my mail box,  gives the peaple who would do this a little more time to

And yes if thay set the reply-to: feild of the message to me I do consider
it my post and cancelble from me.

Nope you haven't relised that the austrailian goverment is the well
trained lap dog of amirica.  Always ready to roll over and get screwed by
the USA.
Of cause not, who would turst a subordermate with such things.  Of cause
we have devoloped softwhere (like SSLeay) that works just as well as any
from the US.  But we can't export something to au because the US is so
much more advansted then us, so we can't be trusted with such products.

Our goverment has this quite silly beleafe that if we tag allong with all
your wars, when we get attacked the great Amiracan peaple will come to our
aid out of a sence of appreashation.
The flaw with this is that most amaricans don't know where australia is,
let allown care about it.
