Filling in the cross-references between 5D002 and 5A002 in the above URL,
I read the following: a.  Software having the same characteristics, or performing or simulating

employing digital or analog techniques to ensure "information security" is
controlled.  b.  Software designed or modified to use such software is controlled.
