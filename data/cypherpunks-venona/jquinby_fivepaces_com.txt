This is my first post to the list.
Aren't there mail drops already in operation that do just this? I seem to
recall that the only way to get QSL cards (non-radio folks bear with me)
from pirate SW stations was to go via their mail drops. The section of
Monitoring Times magazine that deals in pirate radio has a list of mail
drops used by the stations (or it used to, anyway). Seems like I saw them in
the classifieds of Rolling Stone or some such place.

Actually, I think the line reads "They take our week, and make it longer."
(There's a line a little later that goes "Trading your hours for a handful
of dimes.")
Slightly left of topic, but it is a great song! :)
Someone ought to compile a "Best of Crypto-references in pop culture" file.
