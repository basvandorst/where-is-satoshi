@_subject: PGP 2.2 is hard to find...! 
The _ONLY_ place that I have been able to find PGP 2.2 is on
soda.berkeley.edu, thanks to Eric.  Ever other place that has been
advertised seems to be empty for whatever reasons.  Apparently it was at
some of these locations previously, as others say that this is where their
copy came from, but it is only on Soda as of this morning (Monday).

I agree.  Anyone can sit and say "Oh, that article is a piece of crap", but
these same people never put their "money where their mouth is" and write an
article of their own.
I've written for both Phrack and 2600 and it sure as hell isn't hard to get
something submitted.  If you think you can do better by all means write an
article and send it in.  If trash is being published, why not try to correct
If you have any problems with where to send it, I'll gladly forward you the
Otherwise, shut the hell up.  If you don't like your goverment, vote.  If you don't like something that is published, write something yourself.  It's not some type of elite club of
writers, both publications welcome people of all walks to submit.  Douglas Mason                                douglas

The problem is that Phrack has a distribution that goes in other directions,
where a simple Usenet newsgroup can not reach.  I've seen files from past
Phrack issues available on Public Domain archive sets for BBS's.  Phrack has
been around for quite a while now and unlike a lot of the other series
on-line mags, it is probably going to be around for a while longer.  CuD and
the likes are great for news, but where else can you find somewhat lengthy
papers on various topics?  Even if most of it is elementary, there is always
something interesting in each issue, even if it is just to see some of the
personalities that are out there.
Like it or not, piece of crap or otherwise, it does get around.  It's going
through ownership changes and probably would like to find some people that
would be willing to help out with "cleaning" it up.  Why not help?
