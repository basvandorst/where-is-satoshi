@_subject: The Computer Shopper cipher 
Compared to the lines of the Computer Shopper program, how would this variant evaluate out time-complexity wise?  I'm not sure how sophisticated the
attacks on pseudo-random generators are.
This one includes an random generator shift, based upon the random numbers.

@_subject: that cipher I wrote 
Peter Davidson: thanks for the cycle tester!!!!!  hadn't thought about
testing a generator.  As for those generators, they are seeded with the key,
but, I messed it up by getting the primes in the wrong order.
What characteristics of the multiplier and modulator provide large periods?

@_subject: wired covers 
In Chico, California, the two book stores large enough to have Wired have
Mitch Kapor (Tower Books) and Peter Gabriel (Readmore Books).  I might go
pick up the other cover. :)

@_subject: money tracing 
since 1990, the Treasury has placed a nylon strip inside the paper of most of
the printed money ($10's and above, I believe).  This strip has letters on it,
spelling out "USA TWENTY" (for the $20 bill) such that it can only be seen if
light is passed through the note.  This was officially meant to prevent the
high quality scanners and color printers from being able to forge money, since
the scanner would not be able to reproduce the reflectively-invisible letters
in the strip.
Wonder if they could include such a technique in money tracking.
Has anyone ever checked the green ink on money for magnetic resonance?
