@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] "bits": Unit of account 
It seems to me that xbit is no more distinct or intuitive than ?bit. In
either case it's simply an arbitrary character in front of the word "bit".
Of course, for the majority of the world familiar with SI, the ? actually
adds additional meaning that is lost with the x.
Furthermore, given the multiple concerns voiced about the overuse of the
word "bit", ?BTC seems to solve the problem.
Since we are talking about how it would be displayed in software, we don't
need to be concerned about how people will pronounce it, or what the
nickname will be.  If most of the wallets start displaying amounts in ?BTC
quantities, it will be obvious that a ?BTC is a different magnitude than a
BTC.  Nobody is going to look at their 100,000 ?BTC balance and think they
have 100,000 BTC. People will immediately make the mental adjustment to the
new order of magnitude even if they don't specifically know that ? means
micro, or that micro means 1e-6.
Nicknames will form organically (much like buck, fin, large, k, grand, and
benny for U.S. currency), I've always been partial to milly (or millie) and
mike (or micky) as nicknames for mBTC and ?BTC.  I've personally used those
when speaking with people, and they seem to catch on pretty quickly.
As has already been mentioned, you're going to be hard pressed to find
software that denotes U.S. balances in "bucks".  There isn't any good
reason to be coding a nickname like "bit", "xbit", or "mike" into wallet
