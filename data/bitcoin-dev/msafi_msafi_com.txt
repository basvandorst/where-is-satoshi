@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] I want to rebuild the GUI in JavaScript 
I?d like to try to rebuild Bitcoin Core GUI using the JavaScript Electron
framework. My goal is to get a real world understanding of the pros and
cons of moving from Qt to Electron.
Before I start, I?d like to know if this has been tried before or if there
are ongoing efforts in this direction by anyone?
I spent sometime looking into how to implement this. One approach could be
for Electron to drive the UI by running bitcoind and communicating with it
through RPC. But I don?t know if such implementation can achieve
feature-parity with the Qt implementation. Qt has the advantage of direct
access to Bitcoin Core code.
Anyways, I just wanted to share these ideas before going further with them,
so please let me know if you have any information on the above!

Thank you for the feedback Jonas. It was helpful.
I'll take this topic off list since this is probably not the right place
for it, but just for those who emailed me asking about how to follow the
progress, I've been working on a proof-of-concept over the last month and
published it here: I would appreciate contributions toward growing this. Check out the bottom
of the README for ways to get involved. Thanks!
