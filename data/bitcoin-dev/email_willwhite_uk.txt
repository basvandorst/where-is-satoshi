@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Bitcoin URI for multiple addresses without using URLs 
Dear bitcoin-dev,
I'm making a website to tell my bitcoin wallet program to donate to more than one address at a time. BIP71 needs me to include a URL to do this, and then the wallet has to find out the information from the URL. I'd prefer to just send my wallet a URI with all the information it needs to make the donations.
Please would you tell me if this idea is BIP-able?
