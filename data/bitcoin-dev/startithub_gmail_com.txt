I agree with Ittay: when bugs are found, they must be fixed ASAP,
expecially when they affect a sensitive sw such as Bitcon; in IT security,
every flaw that is exploitable in abstract, is going to be exploited in
real, sooner or later, also taking into account the increasing parallel
computing power; beware of false sense of security

Patrick, could you please explain us why the solution proposed by Ittay
would drop the actual honest miners ratio, becoming so backfire? Thanks a

Thank you very much for your fair response, Sir;
this means that anytime a bug is found in Bitcoin protocol, chances are
that it would take a lot more time to get fixed
