Oh, excuse me; it looked related to me.
It was not at all my intention to mess down the thread; on the contrary I
was trying to be of help and at the same time getting an answer.
No, I must recognize that I was not aware of sendmany. This is my first
time managing bulk transactions.
Thank you very much for your help.
I lead a group of developers and we are trying to be of help to the Bitcoin
community at large, and to this group.
Kindest regards,

I am new on the list. I got a similar problem.
If I put "sendToAdress" transactions to bitcoind, it will accept between 1
and 3 transactions per minute, depending on the underlying machine.
If I try to send one transaction every 20 seconds or less, bitcoind stops
responding to RPC calls.
Does anybody know of any solution / fix / workaround for this?
Thanks in advance.
