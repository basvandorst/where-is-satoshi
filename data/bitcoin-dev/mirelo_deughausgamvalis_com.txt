@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Proof-of-Loss 
With the feedback on Proof-of-Loss (always privately to my email), I realized the article was hard to understand for lacking:
* A more explicit definition of transaction rights.
* An overview of how the algorithm works.
As an abstract could not contain all that, I wrote an introduction with examples.
I also adopted a suggestion of including the current block height in the proof-of-loss data once I realized:
* Preventing the same proof-of-loss from chaining consecutive blocks was not the purpose of the proof-of-loss context, which did it statistically rather than logically.
* The presence of that height in the block header made serial chaining easier to enforce, by removing the need to include additional block height information.
While revising the algorithm, I made some corrections, mainly to:
* Transaction prioritization (which now uses fees instead of rights).
* Inactivity fees.
Finally, the new version more aptly derives the design and often has better wording.

An alternative consensus algorithm to both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake, proof-of-loss addresses all their deficiencies, including the lack of an organic block size limit, the risks of mining centralization, and the "nothing at stake" problem:

No, it is not, but I would like to ask anyone with any feedback on proof-of-loss to please direct it only to my email, or else follow the discussion links on the Proof-of-Loss home page.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Proof-of-Loss -- Errata 
There was an error on page 5 of the paper, which made the block-chaining odds formula confusing. The error was in the text, not in the formula, and consisted of assuming the affected route as always being the rewarded one, which is false. The corrected version is already available at the same URL ([ The new file's date is 02/07/2017, and downloading it will probably require clearing the browser's cache.
I would greatly appreciate any feedback, preferably directly to my email, to avoid overloading this list with something not directly related to Bitcoin.
