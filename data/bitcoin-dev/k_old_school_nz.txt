Just so we're clear, what is the need for HTTP at all?
A query for a string and an answer can all be handled via DNS.

This is the first proposal I've seen regarding mapping something like
user at host that actually makes sense to me.
Bitcoin itself is decentralised by design, in my opinion it seems obvious
that it needs to continue to maintain this feature.

The "satoshi" bitcoin client already supports use over TOR with the proxy
option - I think this was something Satoshi made regular use of.

Agreed :)
For those that believe one particularly noisy country in the North America
region with a policy called SOPA or PIPA directly affects Bitcoin - can you
point out precisely where it does so?

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Hosting of compiled bitcoin client 
Hi team,
Given that sourceforge has shown to restrict access to a number of
countries at the request of the USA, would hosting of the compiled client
on  be an alternative that
would be considered?
It seems like a logical alternative to me that requires little effort as it
is already in use as the code repository.
Kind regards,
