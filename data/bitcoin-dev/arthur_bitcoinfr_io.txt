@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] URI scheme for signing and verifying messages 
Hi,I realized that there isn't any way to ask for a signature (or to verify a message) as easily you can do when requesting a payment using a bitcoin URI scheme (BIP0021).I think a URI scheme to use the signing tools in bitcoin core might be useful, and with a proper consensus it could become available in most bitcoin clients who already support message signing/verifying and payment url (or QRCode) and enable new uses of bitcoin signatures.A way to gain proper consensus is going through a BIP, so that's why I'm here: to present my idea publicly before going any further (draft BIP and reference implementation).Some thoughts?- like BIP0021: "Bitcoin clients MUST NOT act on URIs without getting the user's authorization." so signing requires the user to manually approve the process?- it could use the same URI scheme than BIP0021 with an additional parameter (ex: signaction=) or use another one like BIP121 (ex: btcsig:)PS : I'll also post a topic in "Development & Technical Discussion" section on Bitcointalk

My proposal is about the current signing process (which exists event it it's not perfect) but it could also work with a new signing message system tomorrow. It more about give users an easier way to access existing tools than the "sign message thing" itself.
BTW I'm aware of privacy issues, but could you elaborate on why the use case your are referring to doesn't actually work?
Here are a use of bitcoin signatures (  ) to speak about a real case.

Ideally yes, but it will take some time to make a new signature system.
I could also propose a URI scheme that will work with a future implementation but be compatible with the current one explaining its limitations (ex: sigversion=1 to use the current system, default value is sigversion=2 which won't work until a new system is developped).
Ok,thx for your answer, I actually agree with you up until the last sentence. (if not I wouldn't propose this URI scheme :-)
