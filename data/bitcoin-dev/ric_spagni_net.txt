Hi Mike,
FYI there is a company called Netki is also working on a kind of DNSSEC
Netki's solution is incredibly limited, it's a single return value and no
metadata (where OA encapsulates metadata in KV pairs). This does not lend
itself well to handling BIP70-style communication.
As an aside, they also seem to have a complete disregard for lookup
privacy, which we address in OpenAlias by means of DNSCrypt encrypted
lookups. To that end we have even written the first independent DNSCrypt
implementation (ie. over-and-above dnscrypt-proxy) which provides a full
Python implementation that uses libsodium / nacl if available, but falls
back to a 100% Python slownacl implementation:

Good, that's roughly analogous with what OpenAlias defines.
We DO provide a service where we will register or host
Also good, much the same as  and And this is the part where you guys look really, really incompetent (and I
don't mean that in a terribly demeaning way, it's just that you're in a
space where you want to be a domain expert, not make a series of
embarrassing and public faux pas).
DNSCrypt requires NO work on the part of the alias creator, DNS server,
SOA, or anything else. It is entirely client side, and allows for *private
lookups*. HD Wallets and Payment Requests are inconsequential, an ISP still
knows every DNS resolution their users are performing.
When using dnscrypt-proxy to perform private lookups they are done against
the 55 free and public DNSCrypt resolvers [1], provided by oVPN, OpenNIC,
OpenDNS, okTurtles, CloudNS, and various individuals. OpenAlias links to
and recommends four of these specifically, as they have the unique
combination of providing Namecoin lookups, supporting DNSSEC validation for
lightweight verification, and claiming not to store logs.
Therefore, DNSCrypt provides encrypted, private, secure, end-user lookups
with no implication on the creation side. That you are unaware of this
(when presumably you at least read the Wikipedia article on the topic) and
are not embracing it is quite surprising, to say the least.
OpenAlias supports this as well, except it does it better by allowing the
KV pairs to also contain a TLSA record before the request, which
effectively makes it a DANE-secured interaction. Your interaction requires
the trusting of multiple CAs, which is an inherent weakness.
3> We use a 2 tier lookup format.  The first lookup returns a list of
We do the same thing, except in a single call. Here's an example of a
record that has both XMR and BTC addresses:
 (here are the DNS
records for that:
With OpenAlias a DNSSEC fail is a soft fail, and the user has to confirm
the address. The reasons are threefold:
1. At the moment only 83.5% of the TLDs are signed [2]. The unsigned ones
include some biggies like .sg, .za, and .to
2. Even if the zone *is* signed, DNSSEC deployment is hard. Unmanaged
DNSSEC deployment is out of scope for probably 99.9% of users, even the
usually-technically-ok Bitcoin crowd. Managed DNSSEC is available, but is
quite pricey. UltraDNS, Dyn, and GoDaddy (ikr?) are the three big
providers, and of those three only GoDaddy has a consumer-affordable
3. ThomasV and I have done a stack of testing behind residential and
commercial routers where DNSSEC simply fails (eg. the router runs a really
outdated DNS server that doesn't provide RRSIGs in its response, or the ISP
doesn't care about DNSSEC). Unsurprisingly, this can be fixed by...you
guessed it...doing the lookup via DNSCrypt.
Until we are closer to the bulk of all TLDs being signed, and DNSSEC
becomes at least a little more ubiquitous, we can't lock out huge portions
of the Internet, because then we're not really providing a useful and
usable solution. All we can is make it more difficult to pay an unverified
Of course, if your aim is to force people to use you as a domain registrar,
then it makes total sense why you'd lock people out;)
Additionally, we just released another open source API server to help
Oh snap...
OpenAlias (and your system) doesn't really have to worry about that, as TXT
records can live side-by-side with A / CNAME / MX etc. records. More
importantly, OpenAlias especially doesn't have to worry about it, because
OpenAlias TXT records have a prefix: "oa1:" for OpenAlias v1 records. The
risk of there being a legitimate TXT record that starts with oa1: and
*isn't* an OpenAlias record is, well, pretty negligible.
In any case, I'd much rather we had one effort going forward than
I agree, and you guys are in an ideal position to change to supporting the
OpenAlias standard (and enhancing it) without skipping a beat. We would
definitely appreciate and take your input and efforts, and that would make
OpenAlias v2 (oa2:) a standard built out in conjunction with Netki.
Not only do you get Electrum support without lifting a finger, but it will
go a long way to repairing your relationship with the open-source community
at large, several proponents of which have taken great umbrage at what you
were previously pushing as a closed-source, centralised system.

You're misstating (or not understanding) the attack surface.
State-level attackers won't compromise 50+ DNSCrypt servers, they can get the
information on lookups a lot more trivially. Censorship resistance and
protection from state-level attackers comes from the decentralised side of
OpenAlias (ie. Namecoin resolution, preferably done using a local copy of the
NMC blockchain). Since Netki supports Namecoin resolution too there is no need
to worry about protecting end users from that.
There is, however, a need to protect users from man-in-the-middle attacks where
the data is not modified en-route, but it is sniffed. Who you pay in a financial
transaction is, and should be, privileged information between yourself and that
person. By encouraging open DNS lookups you're effectively hanging that
information out for all to see.
It is true that there are only 4 DNSCrypt servers we are comfortable
recommending. It is also true that there were, at one stage, only 4 Electrum
servers. There were also only 4 Bitcoin nodes. As something grows and becomes
more useful and usable the number of voluntary participants becomes much
greater, and we will provide the necessary tools to enable these volunteers.
So in a world where tens of thousands of Bitcoiners are using an aliasing
standard (which, in and of itself, is a convenience service anyway), and
hundreds of individuals and companies are hosting DNSCrypt resolvers, is it even
a valid argument to harp on the number of "proxies"? Thus it is not worth
talking about today. It is definitely worth discussing in future if the number
of DNSCrypt resolvers doesn't increase, but that is a different discussion for a
different time.
Everyone should be highly privacy conscious when it comes to financial
transactions, and it would be unconscionable of both you and I not to defend
end-user privacy.
It's important to remember that the "paranoid" won't use an aliasing service, or
at best will use a local Namecoin blockchain for that purpose. This is a
convenience service to provide general and broad appeal for the non-technical,
and those are the very people that need to be protected from nosey neighbours /
workmates / ISPs. Privacy is not only (or even at all) about protecting people
buying drugs on a darknet market, it is about defending personal liberties.
Embedding the TLSA record in a KV pair just means that pinning takes one less

Coinmarketcap lists 643 currencies and assets, of which only 131 have had more
than $500 in trade volume in the last 24 hours (and only 8 have done over $100
000 in volume). ShapeShift only lists 44 of those. I seriously doubt that a
convenience service such as aliasing will find great use amongst every
fly-by-night scamcoin that crops up, but that is an aside.
"Scale" is a misnomer. Someone trying to collect every single active
cryptocurrency and house them all under a single sub-domain is an outlier, not a
problem to be faced at scale. I do not think we will see a large scale movement
to "collect" all the various cryptocurrency tokens, no matter how worthless they
are, and then subsequently setup aliases for them.
I'm not sure how this is any greater leakage than 100 individual requests for
the openly accessible data, especially since it would be encrypted if made via
Naughty naughty, you're doing that thing again where you're using a smattering
of expertise to appear knowledgeable about a subject.
So let's hypothetically say that an individual was crazy enough to have all 643
of the Coinmarketcap currencies/assets aliased on a single sub-domain. The
OpenAlias example of a Monero address (with a recipient name) is 157 bytes long,
due to there being two public keys serialised in the address, plus the ~12 bytes
of overhead per RR (the DNS wire format uses label compression, so the FQDN
wouldn't be repeated for each returned record). Let's call it 170 bytes. That
makes the returned data just over 100kb.
Now let's first address a couple of things, assuming that someone would be nuts
enough to do this:
1. This is way larger than the UDP packet maximum, and this would never come
back as a "regular" ol' DNS request (512 bytes max). This may seem bad, until
you consider that DNSSEC responses are almost assured to exceed 512 bytes (eg.
an NXDOMAIN with NSEC3). The size of the response is big, but that's hardly
something to write home about.
2. If the DNS server supports RFC2671 (EDNS) then it would try and send it via
UDP, and as long as the client says it can receive such a huge response over UDP
it'll come over the wire.
3. However, because RFC2671 can result in a DNS amplification attack, it's been
obsoleted by RFC6891 (EDNS0), which is pretty much ubiquitous for all resolvers
that support DNSSEC (because of the very large DNSSEC responses, and the fact
that DNSSEC resolvers want to avoid participation in an amplification attack).
EDNS0 mitigates amplification attacks.
4. In the event that an EDNS0 response fails (eg. the client says it can't
accept anything over, say, 4kb, which is quite common) then there's an automatic
and silent switch to DNS-over-TCP (RFC5966). DNS-over-TCP uses TFO (TCP Fast
Open) to do an extremely fast handshake and passing a cookie to the client in
the SYN-ACK, which can then be used for subsequent requests, but data is still
carried in the SYN. TFO mitigates amplification attacks.
You can't both be overly concerned about amplification attacks *and* use DNSSEC,
which necessitates large records. And, at any rate, the issue with amplification
attacks *isn't* the size of the records (there are tons of records just under
4kb, like an ANY request against isc.org, that are far better suited to
amplification attacks), it is the number of recursive open resolvers. There is
improvement in this space, though, and many open recursive resolvers have been
fixed in recent years.
Doesn't really matter what they require as long as there are zones that remain
unsigned. Plus it's not like new .za / .sg / .to registrations magically get
DNSSEC, they're also out of luck.
Oh, ok. "First, lose no money, but it's ok if your ISP / neighbour / colleague
reports you to the cops because you sent a donation somewhere you shouldn't."
Adding the DS record to a domain is trivial, but to use DNSSEC with Gandi or
GoDaddy (if you don't have their PremiumDNS product) you have to host your own
DNS server. Sorry, but that is a non-trivial task. Even worse: you need to
secure your private KSK and not keep it on the server, and if Bitcoiners are
anything to go by this won't happen.
Oh, and incidentally, ENOM/Namecheap doesn't have DNSSEC support yet.
You're literally layering complexity on top of a convenience service, and to
what end?
That's completely, 100% centralised. You're creating decentralisation theatre by
providing "options" that no ordinary person will use.
I doubt that very much. See:
As can be seen, only ~14% of all DNS queries request DNSSEC validation. That's
very far from ubiquitous, and completely matches what Thomas and I found in
Berlin. Unsurprisingly, this stat is particularly bad given that it also shows
that ~15% of all queries are being handled by Google's Public DNS, without which
the stat would be much lower.
Fine, so we're just cutting Africa out, then?
Even beyond that, ICANN's page listing DNSSEC-capable registrars (last updated
December 2014) only lists only a handful:
A soft fail doesn't magically let the money go. It warns users of the risk and
asks them to verify the address by site. This could even be built out so that
higher value transactions (say, anything over $1000) hard fails in the absence
of DNSSEC, and anything particularly high value (say, anything over $50 000)
refuses to use an alias at all and requires an actual cryptocurrency address.
Now you're just trolling.
Which has this lovely line in it:
So you provide an open standard that uses DNS...but then you wanted to force
CoPay users to use your centralised API?
In December 2014 your website had no "developer" section (curl -s
 | grep
The first time that section got scraped was the end of April:
Even in its current form your website makes no mention of alternatives or
options for those wishing to secure an alias. End users are undoubtedly left
with the distinct impression that they can only get one by paying you.

Agreed, although I guess the bootstrap time for that is a little on
the high side, and maybe a little too chunky on mobile devices, but
it's absolutely worthwhile as an option. DNSSEC is great because it
doesn't allow resolvers to lie, they can't even pretend that a record
doesn't exist.
My current thinking with Electrum (that ThomasV and I have bounced
around) is to make the default policy DNSCrypt -> fallback to
OpenAlias API pool (which can return DNSSEC data for verification) ->
fallback to default resolver. Turning off DNSCrypt will then make it
default resolver -> fallback to OpenAlias API pool. Turning off the
API pool will make it default resolver or fail. Default resolver can
be set to OS resolver (default) or custom resolvers (eg. Google Public

There are several reasons why we rejected doing it this way with OpenAlias:
1. It adds complexity for the alias creator. This may seem
unimportant, but the OpenAlias standard was created to empower people
to create their own aliases as simply as possible, not to make it
overly complex.
2. It's harder to mess things up by dropping a sub-record; you either
have the complete, valid record, or you don't. With a "tiered" system
you can claim that you support a particular alias, but then lack all
or some of the records for it.
3. You retain both forward and backwards compatibility (no need to
introduce a new OA version unnecessarily), as you can have an "old" KV
pair and a "new" KV pair within the same record. The addition of KV
pairs doesn't require the application to know the new pairs exist,
which makes it more extensible.
4. Even better - since an application gets the whole record it can
start off with a minimum viable product that merely gets the address,
and then at a later stage when support is added for additional
metadata *it already has the metadata* and can interpret it.
5. You can still do DNS delegation (proper, SOA delegation) or you can
do delegation via a KV pair of some sort (say, a reroute= pair or
something). In both cases delegation requires an additional lookup, so
there's nothing saved or improved with the two-tier system.
In this instance, as in many others, simplicity trumps complexity, and
the bonus is that the simpler solution is more extensible and
