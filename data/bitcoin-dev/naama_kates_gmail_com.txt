@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] This thread is not about the soft/hard fork 
Hey all, nice to meet you... I'm new to the community and thus, after taking that first step of signing up, have been reading/scanning these threads over the last few days without contributing my own two ?-- not, um, 'trolling', just, you know, educating myself and getting familiar with the group ethos and etiquette.  It wasn't until I'd read ~10 posts that I  understood the initial purpose of the thread!  As few others have mentioned, I'm a bit surprised, at all the back and forth ? la hip-hop 'battling' ;-) It certainly obfuscates-- while entertaining-- to the point where a newbie like myself might drop out... Perhaps this is intentional-- to maintain exclusivity and weed out the uninitiated.  I dunno.  But if not, I'm just noting, as something of an outsider, that it took a while.
But I'd like to contribute.  With what little knowledge I possess, I'm inclined to favor hardfork... Is there a more suitable place to address this?  Perhaps to work on code?  For this specific project, that is...  Anyone point me to a map somewhere?  LOL.
Thanks to all for reading, and much admiration to you all and the work you've done, my latter comments notwithstanding!

Just read the proposal for the dual modes... Think it would be best... Protocol question?  Do we discuss the algorithms here on this forum?  Or...
Sorry again for my thick skull!

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Bitcoin network simulation testing? 
Hi Byron, I've been using shadow a bit-- I think these simulators are important for testing, but Shadow, at least, certainly seems to have limitations, in some crucial respects.  Running shadow w Tor (which is only logical, because many BCT transactions transpire over Tor) is not as 'light' as presented and slows my own box down quite a bit, so the stats can't possibly be accurate... I don't know if this answers any questions or if you've had this experience at all -- perhaps it is negligible on a more powerful machine than my own-- or perhaps there is an adjustment still unaccounted?
