@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Why is deriving public key from the signature not 
I wanted to ask what was the rationale behind still having both public
key and signature in Segwit witness?
As is known for a while, the public key can be derived from the
signature and a quadrant byte, a trick that is successfully used both
in Bitcoin message signing algorithm and in Ethereum transaction
signatures. The later in particular suggests that this is a perfectly
functional and secure alternative.
Leaving out the public key would have saved 33 bytes per signature,
which is quite a lot.
So, the question is - was there a good reason to do it the old way
(security, performance, privacy, something else?), or was it something
that haven't been thought of/considered at the time?

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Schnorr signatures BIP 
Some minor notes as an outsider who just spent an hour implementing and
playing with this:
-In several places you have things like "Let k = int(hash(bytes(d) || m))
mod n", but reference code says things like "e = sha256(R[0].to_bytes(32,
byteorder="big") + bytes_point(point_mul(G, seckey)) + msg)", no modulo.
-x is not defined in "The signature is *bytes(x(R)) || bytes(k + ex mod n)*",
apparently it's the private key.
-jacobi function is great at exposing bugs in divmod implementations, due
to the full 256 bit exponent. Add a line about it being something to watch
-"bytes" notation is defined as "turn to bytes" for an integer, but the
same for a point is "take X with prefix and turn to bytes". Confusing,
might be a good idea to name it differently?
-Finally, it would have been nice to have a larger set of test vectors in a
JSON or CSV file, covering all the edge cases.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Miner dilution attack on Bitcoin - is that something 
Dilution is a potential attack i randomly came up with in a Twitter
arguement and couldn't find any references to or convincing arguments of it
being implausible.
Suppose a malicious actor were to acquire a majority of hash power, and
proceed to use that hash power to produce valid, but empty blocks.
As far as i understand it, this would effectively reduce the block rate by
half or more and since nodes can't differentiate block relay and block
production there would be nothing they can do to adjust difficulty or black
list the attacker.
At a rough estimate of $52 per TH equipment cost (Antminer pricing) and
12.5 BTC per 10 minutes power cost we are looking at an order of $2 billion
of equipment and $0.4 billion a month of power costs (ignoring block
reward) to maintain an attack - easily within means of even a minor
government-scale actor.
Is that a plausible scenario, or am i chasing a mirage? If it is plausible,
what could be done to mitigate it?

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Considering starting a toy full-node 
Hi there.
Been there, done that.
-Don't try to set big goals at once.
Start small and aim for small steps, i.e. by connecting to nodes, then
getting some data from them, then downloading blocks, then parsing
blocks, then building an UTXO set, etc.
My first long term goal was to simply compute the balance of an address.
-Expect to work with huge and varied sets of data.
You'll have to build and use tens of Gb of indexes, for example.
Early transactions also have all sorts of non-standard scripts, and
testnet have all sorts of weird non-standard scripts, so plan
-Don't write off making a wallet or mining.
The latter is easy to do on CPU on testnet and learning to make valid
blocks helps a lot in understanding how things work.
A wallet, on the other hand, gives you good understanding of keys and
transactions, especially if you want to try doing all the EC math
I also wrote things to be generic between several forks and chains,
like Litecoin, Doge, Zcash and a bunch of now-dead alts - there is so
little difference between many of them that all it takes is a
parameter or two. Helps with perspective.
Naturally, stay away from mainnets and real money if you do your own
wallet and crypto.
-Don't get too excited when you'd see exploitable signatures.
All of them were plundered years ago, and by now no one makes mistakes
like that.
Also, there are plenty of bots which are constantly scanning the chain
for weak keys and signatures, any new ones will be gone in a few
-Expect cthulhus. There used to be plenty of artwork and puzzles in
the early blockchain.
Here is a short write up with a few of the things i found: https www
dot ribbonfarm dot
For references, good ones i found and used were:
https bitcoin dot org/en/developer-reference
https en dot bitcoin dot it/wiki/Protocol_documentation
Also, BIPs contain a lot of specific details: https github dot com/bitcoin/bips
That should get you started, and by the time you get into the devilish
details you'll have to look at the code for reference.
No idea about 3), haven't looked at it.
Good luck and have fun.
