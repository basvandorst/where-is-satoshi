@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Bip 32 Question 
Looking at the BIP32 definition, I hit a line that I would appreciate
clarification on.
Under the section "Private parent key ? private child key" there is a step:
"The returned child key ki is parse256(IL) + kpar (mod n)."
Can someone help me understand what "n" is in the context of this
algorithm?  I very well could be looking right at it, but wanted to double
check if I am missing something.
