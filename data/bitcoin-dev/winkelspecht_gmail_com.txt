@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] BIP32 (HD Wallets) implementation in Ruby 
I've been hard at work completing an open source Ruby gem library (called
MoneyTree) that implements Hierarchical Deterministic Bitcoin wallets
(BIP32), and it's about ready for release. It passes all of the test
vectors and has 100% code coverage. I've also written an extensive README
which goes into depth about HD Wallets, which I'll probably be turning into
a blog post.
However, I'm pretty new to crypto, so I wanted to run it by this group
first before releasing it. If anybody has knowledge of BIP32 and can give
at a review, I would greatly appreciate it, and would be glad to add you as
a contributor.
If you have knowledge of the BIP32 spec, but not Ruby, you can still help
by reading over my README for conceptual accuracy.
Check out the repo here: Thanks in advance,
Micah Winkelspecht
