Please see below our BIP for raising the selfish mining threshold.
Looking forward to your comments.
Bitcoin Improvement Proposal
Owners: Ittay Eyal and Emin Gun Sirer
We suggest a change in the propagation and mining algorithm for chains of
the same difficulty, to raise the threshold on Selfish Mining attacks.
* Current situation:
When a miner is notified of a new chain of the same difficulty as the one
it is mining on, it will ignore it.
* Background:
The selfish mining attack and its implications were described in detail in
the following research paper:
* Proposal:
To thwart selfish mining attacks launched by less than 25% of the mining
power, we propose the following change to the protocol:
When a miner learns of more than one chain of the same difficulty, it
should propagate all of them, and choose one of them to mine on uniformly
at random among all chains of the same difficulty.
When hearing of a chain of maximal difficulty that it did not know of
1. Add it to a local list of maximal difficulty chains.
2. Propagate it to its neighbors.
3. Choose a branch uniformly at random from the local list, and mine on it.
* Example:
t0: learn of chain A of difficulty x.
    propagate A to neighbors.
    start mining on A.
t1: learn of chain B of difficulty x.
    propagate B to neighbors.
    toss a coin between A and B; if B wins, switch to mining on B.
t2: learn of chain C of difficulty x.
    propagate C to neighbors.
    toss a 3 faced coin among A, B, and C; switch to mining on the winning
* Concerns and answers:
1. No harm to miners when all are honest.
Mining blocks is a random Poisson process, which is memoryless. Having
mined on the block in the past does not provide an advantage in locating a
solution in the future. Therefore, a miner is not harmed by switching the
chain on which it mines.
2. No new vulnerabilities introduced:
Currently the choice among equal-length chains is done arbitrarily,
depending on network topology. This arbitrariness is a source of
vulnerability. We replace it with explicit randomness, which is at the
control of the protocol. The change does not introduce executions that were
not possible with the old protocol.
3. Complete backward compatibility:
Any subset of the miners can switch to the proposed protocol.
4. Progressive improvement:
Each miner that adopts the change raises the threshold a little bit. The
threshold will reach 25% with universal adoption.

That sounds like selfish mining, and the magic number is 25%. That's the
minimal pool size.
Today the threshold is 0% with good connectivity.
If I misunderstood your point, please elaborate.

The attack can be easily hidden. And be sure that before today, today,
and after today, very smart people are at their computer planning attacks
on Bitcoin. Exploits must be published and fixed FAST.
Nevertheless, I agree  that, as you say, we must not rush it. Look at the
BIP, find if we missed anything, and let's discuss it.
Not really. Please see the discussion section in our paper.
There is no flaw. You were just reiterating that the solution does not give
us the 51% percent security you thought you had before. We showed that
we're not getting this back, I'm afraid.

Check out the following paper for the effect a single node can have on
propagation, and on the relation between block size and propagation speed.
This strongly supports our assumption.
That's a dangerous way to go, opening the door to DoS attacks, as you
mention. Besides, it makes a simple algorithm complicated, and doing such
changes may lead to different vulnerabilities that are difficult to cover.

As far as I understand, the incentives Sergio suggests would work. So
we can assume that the pruned uncle blocks would still win their creators
at least partial revenue.
As for selfish mining - I'm not sure how GHOST affects it. I don't think it
does. The selfish miners just care about heaviest subtree rather than
longest chain. DECOR changes revenue collection significantly, so it
certainly affects selfish mining. I believe it changes the threshold at
selfish mining is profitable, but doesn't deter selfish mining completely:
Selfish miners can still cause others to reduce their revenue by having
them work on older blocks.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] We need to fix the block withholding attack 
Treating the pool block withholding attack as a weapon has bad
connotations, and I don't think anyone directly condones such an attack.
Nevertheless, the mere possibility of the attack could drive miners away
from those overly-large open pools.
As for masquerading as multiple small pools -- that's a very good point,
with a surprising answer: it doesn't really matter. An attacker attacks all
parts of the open pool proportionally to their size, and the result is
basically identical to that of attacking a single large pool.
All that being said -- it's not great to rely on the potential of attacks
and on threats against the honest large pools out there (including GHash,
which, afaik, did nothing more wrong than being successful).

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Proposal: Requiring a miner's signature 
A similar idea was proposed by Sirer and me as a part of two-phase proof of
work (2P-PoW) [1]. In 2P-PoW the first phase is Bitcoin's standard PoW and
the second phase requires the signature. This way Bitcoin doesn't lose its
mining power (read: security) in one day, but rather it is possible to
gradually switch from the current PoW to the signature-based one, slowly
phasing out the existing hardware and mining datacenters.
For a more general view of nonoutsourceable puzzles you can check out
Miller et al.'s paper [2].

They will succeed every time they mine a block after the to-be-double-spent
transaction is placed by the current leader. So a microblock + delay is
than a zero-confirmation transaction, but not as strong as a first-block
A game theory analysis is indeed difficult here, mainly since the
are not entirely clear. We are working towards this, starting with
the attacker's incentive structure.

Fraud proof removes all the attacker's revenue. It's like the attacker
sacrifices an entire block for double spending in the current system. I
think Luke-Jr got it right at that discussion.

That's an interesting point, but such an attack is difficult to pull off.
often run multiple well connected nodes, allowing them to propagate their
generated blocks from multiple vantage points.

Thanks, Matt. Response inline.
On Wed, Oct 14, 2015 at 2:57 PM, Matt Corallo If NG is to be used efficiently, microblocks are going to be very frequent,
and so such forks should occur at almost every key-block publication. Short
reorgs as you described are the norm. A user should wait before accepting a
transaction to make sure there was no key-block she missed. The wait time
is chosen according to the network propagation delay (+as much slack as the
user feels necessary). This is similar to the situation in Bitcoin when you
receive a block. To be confident that you have one confirmation you should
wait for the propagation time of the network to make sure there is no
branch you missed.
As for the malicious case: the attacker has to win the key-block, have the
to-be-inverted transaction in the previous epoch, and withhold his
key-block for a while. That being said, indeed our fraud proof scheme
doesn't catch such an event, as it is indistinguishable from benign
Agreed x3: This is a good point, it is correct, and the tweak is dangerous.
Do you perceive this as a significant practical issue?

Hi Odinn,
I guess to answer we should separate pure-NG from
the hypothetical overlay-NG that runs on top of Bitcoin.
For pure NG one still has to set a transaction bandwidth
limit due to bandwidth and storage limitations of
the individual clients. This rate can be arbitrarily high
with NG without compromising protocol security.
With overlay NG you cannot run above Bitcoin's
bandwidth because all clients must agree on the ledger,
so different clients cannot run at different rates. You
could do two things:
1. Significantly reduce observed latency (time to first
confirmation). Users get better confidence as more
miners adopt NG.
2. Increase the bandwidth once everyone is on
As for privacy - I don't see why NG would change things.
Such privacy schemes are only concerned with the
transaction DAG. NG does not touch this structure. Am
I missing something?
