@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Proposed alternatives to the 20MB step 
What about trying the dynamic scaling method within the 20MB range + 1 year
with a 40% increase of that cap?  Until a way to dynamically scale is
found, the cap will only continue to be an issue.  With 20 MB + 40% yoy,
we're either imposing an arbitrary cap later, or achieving less than great
DOS protection always.  Why not set that policy as a maximum for 2 years as
a protection against the possibility of dynamic scaling abuse, and see what
happens with a dynamic method in the mean time.  The policy of Max(1MB,
(average size over previous 144 blocks) * 2) calculated at each block seems
pretty reasonable.
As an outsider, the real 'median' here seems to be 'keeping the cap as
small as possible while allowing for larger blocks still'.    We know
miners will want to keep space in their blocks relatively scarce, but we
also know that doesn't exclude the more powerful miners from
including superfluous transactions to increase their effective share of the
network.  I have the luck of not being drained by this topic over the past
three years, so it looks to me as if its two poles of 'block size must
increase' and 'block size must not increase' are forcing what is the clear
route to establishing the 'right' block size off the table.
