@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Claiming an OP_RETURN Prefix 
Hi everyone,
My name's Lautaro and I'm currently acting as Tech Lead of Po.et
. At Po.et we use
colored coins
store data on the Bitcoin blockchain with prefix "POET".
I've read in an old version of the OP_RETURN entry of the bitcoin wiki
 that *protocols
wishing to claim OP_RETURN prefixes should use the standard Bitcoin
Improvement Proposals process*.
That entry seems to have changed recently
, no longer
stating that we should follow the BIP process, and I haven't been able to
find any existing BIP claiming an OP_RETURN prexif, but for the sake of
thoroughness I'd like to ask for your help or confirmation here.
Should we actually be using the BIP process to claim a prefix?
Thanks in advance,

Thanks Peter for your prompt reply.
And now that I think of it you're right - as easy as it is for us to
differentiate OP_RETURN outputs that contain the Po.et prefix it would be
for miners to block those transactions altogether. Is this what you mean?
Still, a prefix is something we may have to live with for a little while
until we can address that issue.
Is there a formal / standard process to claim it we should follow?

Sorry for the confusion. We're doing coloured coins ? storing the "POET"
prefix followed by an IPFS hash in the output and storing the full data in
Would you point me to the current work on BIP 160 or the authors?

Thanks Christopher.
putting a hash on in the witness script data won't make things better
(it would actually make them worse) and it definitely doesn't help
"block size bloat".
for timestamping I would recommend using pay 2 contract  instead.
OpenTimestamps. But many times people think they're just doing timestamping
in reality mere timestamps are insufficient for the task.
No, it's not only timestamping. Think of it as storing the URL of something
in the OP_RETURN, only that instead of a URL it's a hash. But it's not just
the hash of the work ? IPFS adds a few other elements that affect this
hash, so calculating it out of the file being added won't do. Also, the
batching OTS uses and the batching we use (using IPFS directories) are
running a copy themselves?  If so, then they can censor your transactions
no matter how you encode them.
Miners would have to try and `ipfs cat` every OP_RETURN of every
transaction (maybe filtering by byte length), which is a relatively high
cost operation. But such a script is straight forward to write and can be
hosted in a cheap AWS machine. We're talking about less than a week of
coding and less than a hundred bucks of hosting, so if they're out to get
you it won't make a difference.
Is it not, if for political rather than economical reasons? These
transactions pay fees like any other.

Hi Karl-Johan, my two cents:
At Po.et we use regtest to simulate reorgs in integration tests in Travis /
CircleCI. It has proved quite useful.
In general regtest for automated testing has given us all we needed so far,
but I admit we have a rather simple use of Bitcoin right now (colored
For local development, we sometimes use a script that "mines" blocks in
regtest periodically. It was my goal to also use this method in QA,
although we wound up using testnet and didn't encounter any problems so far.
Out of curiosity: what limitations did you find in using, for example, a
private network of bitcoin core nodes running regtest? (this gives you the
same power as centralization without any changes or extra functionality
