Dear Jim,
Thank you for sharing your view w.r.t. the so called 'Chinese Miners'.
Diversity of opinion, and mining, are IMHO both good and it's indeed a
free world.... so others who wish to mine bitcoin should be encouraged  to
make the capital and technical investments to do so.
May I ask what is your technical suggestion to move this discussion forward
beyond your anti-Chinese/anti-China rhetoric?   e.g. I would be
particularly grateful if you could share your  views w.r.t. colluding miner
attacks in draft 0.5.9. of Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja's 'Lightning
network' paper, found here:-

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] CFP Bitcoin Scalability Workshop (Sept 12-13), 
Bitcoin Scalability Workshops
In recent months the Bitcoin development community has faced difficult
discussions of how to safely improve the scalability and decentralized
nature of the Bitcoin network. To aid the technical consensus building
process we are organizing a pair of workshops to collect technical
criteria, present proposals and evaluate technical materials and data with
academic discipline and analysis that fully considers the complex tradeoffs
between decentralization, utility, security and operational realities. This
may be considered as similar in intent and process to the NIST-SHA3 design
process where performance and security were in a tradeoff for a security
critical application.
Since Bitcoin is a P2P currency with many stakeholders, it is important to
collect requirements as broadly as possible, and through the process
enhance everyone?s understanding of the technical properties of Bitcoin to
help foster an inclusive, transparent, and informed process.
Those with technical interest are invited to participate in this pair of
workshops with the following intent:
Phase 1: Scene setting, evaluation criteria, and tradeoff analysis.
Montreal, Canada: September 12th-13th, 2015
Scalability is not a single parameter; there are many opportunities to make
the Bitcoin protocol more efficient and better able to service the needs of
its growing userbase. Each approach to further scaling the Bitcoin
blockchain involves implicit trade offs of desired properties of the whole
system. As a community we need to raise awareness of the complex and subtle
issues involved, facilitate deeper research and testing of existing
proposals, and motivate future work in this area.
The purpose of this workshop is to discuss the general tradeoffs and
requirements of any proposal to scale Bitcoin beyond its present limits.
Session topics are to include the presentation of experimental data
relating to known bottlenecks of Bitcoin?s continued growth and analysis of
implicit tradeoffs involved in general strategies for enabling future
This event will not host sessions on the topic of any specific proposals
involving changes to the Bitcoin protocol. Such proposals would be the
topic of a 2nd, follow-on Phase 2 workshop described below; this event is
intended to ?set the stage? for work on and evaluation of specific
proposals in the time between the workshops.
Phase 2 will be planned out further as part of Phase 1 with input from the
Phase 2: Presentation and review of technical proposals, with simulation,
benchmark results.
Hong Kong, SAR, China: TBD Nov/Dec 2015
Hopefully to be easier for the Chinese miners to attend, the second
workshop pertaining to actual block size proposals is to be planned for
Hong Kong roughly in the late November to December timeframe.
The purpose of this workshop is to present and review actual proposals for
scaling Bitcoin against the requirements gathered in Phase 1. Multiple
competing proposals will be presented, with experimental data, and compared
against each other. The goal is to raise awareness of scalability issues
and build a pathway toward consensus for increasing Bitcoin?s transaction
processing capacity or, barring that, identify key areas of further
required research and next steps for moving forward.
Preliminarily, Phase 2 will be a time to share results from experiments
performed as a result of Phase 1 and an opportunity to discuss new
How do the Workshops work?
   -
   Both events will be live-streamed with remote participation facilitated
   via IRC for parallel online discussion and passing questions to the event.
   -
   These workshops aim to facilitate the existing Bitcoin Improvement
   Proposals (BIP)[1] process. Most work will be done outside of the workshops
   in the intervening months. The workshops serve to be additive to the design
   and review process by raising awareness of diverse points of view, studies,
   simulations, and proposals.
   -
   Travel, venue details, and accommodation recommendation are available at
   scalingbitcoin.org. Registration begins August 12th at an early-bird
   ticket price of $150 USD until September 3rd. The ticket prices do not come
   close to covering the venue expense and travel subsidies, hence the need
   for corporate sponsors.
   -
   Please see the FAQ at scalingbitcoin.org which should answer most other
   questions.
Travel Subsidies for Independent/Academic Researchers
There will be an application process for independent or academic
researchers to apply for travel assistance to help cover the expense of
airfare and hotel fees up to $1,000 per qualified presenter who intends to
give a presentation.  The four underwriters of this event have agreed to
jointly review applications and cover the travel subsidies for qualified
presenters. See scalingbitcoin.org for details.
Sponsors of the Montreal Workshop
The first workshop is hosted and with logistics handled by the Montreal
consultancy CryptoMechanics .
The Underwriters jointly responsible for venue expenses and researcher
travel subsidies are currently the MIT Digital Currency Initiative,
Chaincode Labs, Blockstream, and Chain.com.
Current sponsors include: Cryptsy, BitcoinTalk, Final Hash, Blockstream,
MIT DCI, Chaincode Labs, IDEO Futures, Kraken, and Chain.com.

This looks like the beginnings of some great analysis.
Per Peter's remarks, I think it would be productive to run the test(s) on a
simulated network with worst case network failure(s) so that we can
determine the safety margin needed.
I have potential access to h/w resources that would be available for
running such tests at the necessary scales.

I'd rather think of mining as a responsibility than a right per se, but
you're right in so far as it's competitive and self-correcting.

It would be helpful to hear from the other miners, and perhaps arrange some
testing and telemetry in China with 8 ...  that's even a Chinese lucky
number ;)

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Max Block Size: Simple Voting Procedure 
I understand this concern and it's a valid one, including other dimensions
such as better decentralization. Some might argue that the mining pools in
China currently have such power and that's a bad thing:-
I happen to think  that it's unhealthy for the network but the irony is
that they are huge bitcoin fanbase that perhaps should be involved in this,
and other,  decisions. The question is how.
Thus far our friends from f2pool have chimed in with some data from their
perspective. It would be interesting to hear from the others and I'm
finding ways to do exactly that.
So let's find a way to involve, and not alienate them or others. Let's find
a way to get more data and test assumptions and boundaries.
It essentially lets them vote to change the rules of the system.
It's data and yes, it gives then a very visible, verifiable 'vote' ...
though I prefer to think of this as 'voice'  as in a ' hummmm. '
But miners are not the only part of this ecosystem, and they are not the
I fully agree and it doesn't have to be the only voice ...  think 'choir'
...  after all this is an ecosystem with each party playing their
respective roles. But sustainable ecosystems have 'keystone' species, and I
believe these to be the 'honest' miners that help secure the network.
Instead, we vote with the software we run, and all upgrade.
or not as the case may be.   I think we're trying to find a level of rough
consensus where members of the community feel comfortable enough to do this
upgrade in their respective codebase.
Bitcoin was 'unlikely' ...  yet it happened.
Nevertheless you raise the possibility of a different possible path forward
and that's positive. So thank you for doing that!

will need to do it myself anyways since I'm not sure I understand the
nuances, where bitcoin XT fits into the scheme of things (or not) etc.

Dear Adam, All:
At the community's convenience, it would be an honour to arrange an initial
open summit to meet with representatives of the Chinese miners in Hong Kong
(UTC+8) to facilitate a better understand between the different
stakeholders of the Bitcoin ecosystem on this important issue.   This could
be arranged for this October, or earlier, if deemed necessary.
Remote online participation would be welcome from those who might not be
able to attend in person.
However,  it is hoped that such a meeting would be primarily document
driven to facilitate orderly translation, discussion and decision.

establishing a new testnet (e.g. for testing with 8MB blocks)?

I'm sorry for the distraction with the mailing list problems.
Taking an ecosystem view, the miners are important, so are all the other
participants who rely on it and  invest time, effort and energy to make
Bitcoin work and work well.
I am in contact with Primavera and it would appear that the Cyberport is
available for use on October 14 and 15 (Wed/Thursday).
Last November, this was where the Global Bitcoin Summit (Hong Kong)
was hosted with the participation of many of China's leading
Bitcoin-related companies. There is a meeting now in Shanghai.
It would be an honour to host a more technical meeting to discuss BIP100,
101 et al. should be interest to do so.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Bitcoin Core: The globally aware global consensus 
Dear Michael,
I'm very supportive of the idea that there should be thorough and adequate
testing of any proposed change in the maximum block size (e.g. to 8MB). See
Peter Todd's earlier posts on the subject.
Let's work together to establish a testing process to establish the
necessary data transparency and real-world telemetry to help remove
uncertainty as best we can.
Evan has suggested that Huobi would require in the order of 3 months of
testings, first on a test-net.
Working back from BIP101's  11 Jan 2016 date, it would appear that such
testing should begin in early-mid October. Hence my offer to host a
face-to-face meeting in Hong Kong October 14-15.
[NOTE: There is a separate, but possibly related blockchainworkshops.org
meeting being planned in HK by Primavera De Filippi and Constance Choi  for
October 12-13. The main meeting room, for 300 people, has been reserved for
this community's use on October 14,15. Cyberport is able to setup IRC,
livestream video etc. and connect with other satellite conference centers
(e.g. one in Shanghai) should that be desired.]
The purpose of such a face-to-face meeting could be discuss the results of
the testing process e.g. the first set of test(s), and engineer any
remaining ones that will be necessary to raise the level of confidence to
help 'mine consensus' for any hard fork.
If anyone is willing to contribute resources to participate in the design,
execution and analysis of such testing, then please post to this thread and
we can take it from there.
