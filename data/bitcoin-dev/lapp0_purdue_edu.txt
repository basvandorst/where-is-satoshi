Having stakeholders "endorse" blocks has, according to you, the benefits of increasing the number of full nodes and making a 51% attack more expensive. It seems to me it would have the opposite effects and other negative side effects. Any stakeholder that has "won" could just be running an SPV client and be informed by a full node that they have won, then cooperate to collect the reward. You are mistaking proof of stake as a proof you are running a full node. At the same time, the network becomes cheaper to attack in proportion to the amount of the block reward that is paid to "endorsers". Another side effect is that miners would have a bigger economy of scale. The more stake a miner has, the more they can "endorse" their own blocks and not others blocks.

I don't mind a set of central authorities being part of an option IF the central authority doesn't need to be trusted. On the blockchain, the larger miner is, the more you have to trust them to not collude with anyone to reverse your payments or destroy the trust in the system in some attack. On the Lightning network, a large hub can't steal my money.
I think most people share the sentiment that trustlessness is what matters and decentralization is just a synonym for trustlessness when talking about the blockchain and mining, however decentralization isn't necessarily synonymous with trustlessness nor is centralization synonymous with trust-requiring when you're talking about something else.

Your discussion is taking up a lot of room in my inbox and it doesn't seem like either side is getting through to the other. Perhaps you could create a document outlining all the failure modes possible due to the current system, the current systems security assumptions and possible solutions. Now it seems this is just a semantic debate and would probably be better solved with you writing a BIP and having that reviewed and critiqued.
