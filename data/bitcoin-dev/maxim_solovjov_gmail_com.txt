@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Few questions regarding ListTransaction 
I have few questions regarding ListTransaction RPC call and I hope you can
help me.
Documentation for the RPC call is here:
1. What does it mean for a transaction ( with 0 confirmations ) to be
*trusted* or not?
There is such field in the response of ListTransaction
As far as I know bitcoin - nothing is trusted unless there are some numbers
of confirmations.
How does this value is set to true or false?
2. When does *confirmations* can be -1 ( conflicted )?
What does it mean to have conflicted transaction?
Is it about Transaction Malleability? Double Spend? or both?
3. *walletconflicts*. What if I add watch-only address to my bitcoind
This address will not be a part of my wallet.
Now, someone will pay me to this address and someone else will make
Transaction Malleability ( for the sake of example, lets assume this second
one will be confirmed, not the original one ).
Will I get a first transaction in *walletconflicts* array when
ListTransaction will return me second transaction in the response?
Thank you in advance!
