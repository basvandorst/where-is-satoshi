@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] BIP43 Purpose code for voting pool HD wallets 
Hash: SHA256
We'd like to reserve two purpose codes for the HD multisig structure
that will be used for the Bitcoin wallets used for voting pools, so
we've documented the structure in the form of two BIPs. One is used
for the wallets suitable for storing bulk bitcoin deposits, the other
is used for storing colored coin deposits.
The primary difference is that bulk deposit wallets use cold storage
and are allowed to incur significant administrative overhead, where as
colored coin wallets do not use cold storage because they must be
capable of being generated on the fly.
Two draft information BIPs are attached.

I'd call it a "voting pool wallet", since that was the original
application for this arrangement.
Would be nice if you'd at least mention our work, since we did share
it with you back in January and have been publicly documenting it ever
Or does the fact that we're implementing it in btcwallet mean what
we're working on is unmentionable here?

Regarding the BIP process itself, I rather think it's broken in the
case of informational BIPs.
Proposals that require explicit action on the part of others do not
logically belong in the same process as purely information proposals
that do not require any explicit action by others are going to be
carried out regardless.
The only reason we proposed these as BIPs at all was to support the
intent of BIP43.
