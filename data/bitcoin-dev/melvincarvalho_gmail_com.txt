Binary formats can be challenging to deal with and convert to other
formats.  The experiences in the PKI world of ASN.1 have not been great, in
terms of interop.  It tends to create islands and silos.  This is probably
one of the reasons why X.509 and GPG are fragmented and why we dont really
have a widely deployed web of trust on the net.  Another reason is simply
lack of developer resources to make tools.  In that respect I think JSON
offers significant advantages, though I am interested in the security
issues raised.

You raise a good point.
Is there no good canonicalization algorithm / library for JSON?
I think that provided that each JSON object has an identifier,
canonicalization of JSON is not that hard.
Then when you hash or sign the canonical form they can be compared reliably.

Hi Mike, thanks you for the pointer.  I have read up on Protocol Buffers.
If the decision has already been made, then let's go with that, but if not
perhaps I can offer some comments.
Looking at:
And -- "Canonically, Protocol Buffers are serialized into a binary wire
format which is compact, forwards-compatible, backwards-compatible, but not
I can see there are advantages in this approach in that you can send
messages quickly and with low bandwidth.  However the non self describing
data means that it's significantly harder to convert from one format to
another.  Also references are important, and can be achieved in JSON.
Yet in my opinion there is great advantage to growing the bitcoin ecosystem
to interoperate with the whole net, kind of creating a complete web
economy.  The way to do this is to foster interoperability.  Having looked
at and worked with standards for the past 5-10 years that is the great
challenge.  Every system works in an island, and few talk to any others.
However, a market based economy grows exponentially more valuable with
extra liquidity.
Inventing yet another format may lead to balkanization.  If history is a
judge, the chances are high.  A self describing JSON format, however is
much more likely to interop.
I can understand the hesitation with JOSE.  However, if you get a moment,
please look at :
This should provide some of the tools that you need.
As I said above, if the matter is closed, that's fine and thanks for taking
the time to read.
Can I at least propose to make it mandatory for the binary format to have a
translation script to a self describing JSON format and back again.  I
would love to see the bitcoin ecosystem become a major part of the
infrastructure of the web itself (leading to even nice things like a proper
web of trust), as well as an awesome P2P system in its own right.

only risk is in terms of double spend, but rather
1) vandalize the block chain which may be difficult to unwind?
2) use an attack to manipulate the price downwards, then rebuy lower
As bitcoin's market cap grows, incentives to move the market will grow
I guess the market will decide which algorithm is used, but as a community
we can perhaps review the different mining protocols and order them in

So there's a slight world divide in digital payments with bitcoin using

Here's how to bring the two worlds together and enable bitcoins be sent
over webid or payswarm
Problem: Alice and Bob have RSA key pairs, but no public bitcoin
addresses.  Alice wants to send 1 BTC to Bob.
1. Alice takes Bob's WebID and encrpyts it with her private key (to create
entropy) ...
2. Alice uses that message as the seed to produce btc address (as per
 ) with ECDSA key pair
3. Alice sends coins to this address
4. Alice and then encrypts the seed again with Bob's public key
5. Bob decrypts the seed using his private key
6. Bob can now use the seed to recreate the wallet and spend the coins
Unless I've made an error, I believe this unites the web paradigm and
crypto currency paradigm into one potentially giant eco system ...

Yes this works too.
However is it dependent on the bitcoin client address generation algorithm?
I think what I'm trying to describe is something more akin to the way a
shared secret is generated by TLS.
Agree, that the wallet is also shared, ive not yet worked out a way to
'blind' one side of the wallet, but nor have a proved it's impossible, so

Perhaps I've not described the problem statement as clearly as I could,
I'll work on it.  Essentially it's an automated way to bootstrap the RSA
key community together with bitcoin.  e.g. 99% of GPG users probably dont
have a bitcion wallet or address or client.  I think maybe a user story

Persona, in it's current state, is the exact opposite of the principle
behind of bitcoin.
Bitcoin sought to reduce dependence on trusted third parties, where as,
persona is increasing the reach of trusted third parties.  The keys and
passwords are stored on mozilla's servers, sometimes on your email
providers.  Persona, is however, a progression and will hopefully improve
its security and decentralization as it goes along.
A (client or server side) X.509 cert can be issued to any address, be it
email, telephone, webpage, *or* to a bitcoin address, it allows any URI in
he subjectAlternativeName field.  This is much more of bitcoin like model
where the private key sits on your client and the public key is in
discoverable by the other end.
Most enterprises (including Mozilla) take the stance that key management on
the client is beyond the average user.  The notable exception is twitter
who are rolling out 2 factor auth based on PKI.

off with security.

Yes, there is a reliance on DNS, which Tim calls the 'Achilles heel' of the

Mozilla also have a master key to most email accounts, so if anyone got
access to that they could impersonate the vast majority of users that have
not opted in.  I would not use persona for financial stuff, but if I made a

I've been using SSO for years using an X.509 private key in my browser, and

The unfortunate thing is that X.509 tends to use RSA, and bitcoin tends to
use ECC for space reasons.  Since, in its simplest form, bitcoin is a
distributed ledger of public key / balance values you could imagine an
enormous eco system where every key pair become a wallet with 10s of
millions of users.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Fwd: Creating a Currency for the (Read / 
FYI: I think this may be a possible blue print for a web version of
bitcoin+ripple combined.
---------- Forwarded message ----------
I've been thinking for a while about how to create a currency for the read
write web.  And I thought I'd share some preliminary ideas.  Essentially
this is bitcoin+ripple translated to the Web.
For those not familiar with the bitcoin concept it's essentially a
distributed ledger where each subject is a primary key in the ledger and
can hold 0 or more coins.  Coins are transferred using a signed and
timestamped PKI transaction log from one address to another, in a
distributed data base.
I think using a portable URI for addresses is the thing that makes most
sense.  So possibilities for this may be a URN, or schemes such as di:
(digest) or ni: (named information).  Anyone should be able to generate an
address, and they should be wide ranging to improve liquidity.
Balances can be calculated by summing all inputs to that address.  You can
additionally keep a state of balances using the payswarm vocab, or perhaps,
I think a distributed data base could be maintained using read / write web
technologies, such as HTTP POST / PATCH or SPARQL Update.  The signatures
could be added using the WebKeys spec.
*Distributed Database
There are challenges associated with maintaining a distributed database.  I
suggest we start small and whoever opts in can become part of the
verification process.  There are two recent methods for mitigating race
conditions an important one of which is called "double spend".  One is
proof of work, the other is consensus based on a unique node list.  I would
suggest using both techniques.  I'd like it to be possible to use both HTTP
(with self signed certificates), HTTP, and (secure) websockets too as the
transport layer.
*Coin Creation
This tends to be the most contentious point, with people tending not to
like the "premine" concept where you allocate coins to yourself.  However
companies like opencoin have successfully rolled out multi million or even
billion dollar premine schemes.  I would suggest coin creation in line with
bitcoin, where they are created proportionally to those maintaining the
integrity of rhe shared database.
*Spam Protection
Given the nature of the system, it may be easy to spam the network with
micro transactions.  As such there should be a transaction fee where those
that pay the highest fee are prioritized.
*Trust and Reputation
I think it would also help to have a trust and reputation system added to
the process, such that honest nodes benefit from acting honestly, and nodes
which are dishonest or not up to date are considered less dubious.  The
nature of the function should be that it's exponentially harder to gain
trust after you have a certain score.  Similar to chess ELO ratings.
*Linked Data and Exensibility
I think there should be a deep integration with web principles and linked
data to promote an app eco system and allow unexpected reuse.  Also it
should allow extensions such as the ripple protocol's trust lines, IOUs and
distributed markets, which are not initially scoped out.  Reusing existing
concepts such as the bitcon blockchain (e.g. so-called coloured coins),
ripple ledger, opentransactions, payswarm and web credits should all be
Just some food for thought.  Criticisms welcome.  Please let me know if
you're interested in running a node, and maybe we an get a reference
implementation going, as proof of concept.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Revocability with known trusted escrow 
It's great that this article quotes the first page of Sasoshi's white
paper.  There are some other text that they missed, though, which I think
may be relevant.
Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since
financial institutions cannot
avoid mediating disputes. The cost of mediation increases transaction
costs, limiting the
minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for
small casual transactions,
and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible
payments for non-
reversible services. With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust
spreads. Merchants must
be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they
would otherwise need.
A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable. These costs and
payment uncertainties
can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism
exists to make payments
over a communications channel without a trusted party.
What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof
instead of trust,
allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other
without the need for a trusted
third party. Transactions that are computationally impractical to reverse
would protect sellers
from fraud, and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to
protect buyers.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Revocability with known trusted escrow 
Also see satoshi's comments on this, though it may be restating what others
have said:
"Here's an outline of the kind of escrow transaction that's possible in
software.  This is not implemented and I probably won't have time to
implement it soon, but just to let you know what's possible.
The basic escrow: The buyer commits a payment to escrow. The seller
receives a transaction with the money in escrow, but he can't spend it
until the buyer unlocks it. The buyer can release the payment at any time
after that, which could be never. This does not allow the buyer to take the
money back, but it does give him the option to burn the money out of spite
by never releasing it. The seller has the option to release the money back
to the buyer.
While this system does not guarantee the parties against loss, it takes the
profit out of cheating.
If the seller doesn't send the goods, he doesn't get paid. The buyer would
still be out the money, but at least the seller has no monetary motivation
to stiff him.
The buyer can't benefit by failing to pay. He can't get the escrow money
back. He can't fail to pay due to lack of funds. The seller can see that
the funds are committed to his key and can't be sent to anyone else.
Now, an economist would say that a fraudulent seller could start
negotiating, such as "release the money and I'll give you half of it back",
but at that point, there would be so little trust and so much spite that
negotiation is unlikely. Why on earth would the fraudster keep his word and
send you half if he's already breaking his word to steal it? I think for
modest amounts, almost everyone would refuse on principle alone."

FYI: some musings on how crypto currencies might be combined with social
good ...
---------- Forwarded message ----------
Crypto currencies are doing quite well, but they have yet to make a
meaningful impact on any economy, nor have they achieved much in the way of
social good, however there is a tangible excitement about ways that it can
modernize the way we live our lives
We live in a world where 10,000 children under the age of five die every
day, which can be prevented by simple, affordable interventions ... why do
we let this happen?
Turning he question on its head, what interventions do crypto currencies
enable us to perform, that could help solve this problem
Well certainly crypto currencies have opened pandora's box in terms of
technology being able to create money, let it float, and let it appreciate
in value ... something that the alchemists of old (whose number include
Aristotle, Newton and Keynes) would have been proud.  Well done Satoshi,
now what shall we do with this gift?
The optimal principle should be that we beam new money to the people that
need it most, on a relatively uniform basis.  Something of a harder
problem, and one with no perfect solution.  But we could make some
approximations ... perhaps.
Suppose you were to credit 10,000 new coins to every person on the planet.
Then let it float on the free market (a la bitcoin).  Initially worth zero,
the coins would potentially rise in value to become a consensus driven
global dividend.  Certainly if it went higher it could do a lot to
alleviate many problems for poorer people.
Unfortunately we dont have a huge database of every person on the planet in
the public domain, so this strategy is problematic.  However we roughly do
have good statistics that most people have a mobile phone, so we could beam
coins to every mobile phone.  (technically you can do this using the tel:
URI scheme such that you get one phone, one share).
Phones are now banks, and also have the ability to send money via SMS.
The problem with this approach is that it favours people with multiple
phones, who are probably correlated to relatively wealthy people.  Not
great, but it's a start.
How about we then do it country by country and beam coins to the poorest
countries, say in proportion to GNP per capita.  Perhaps better.
Again, it's possible to systematically game the system, to an extent.  So
one way to reduce the risk would be to allocate coins on a lottery basis,
where a random number generator selects 'lucky' winners.  The net effect
will be generally positive, while preventing major systemic risk.
Little by little, we can bring people out of poverty using crypto coins and
make a better world.
Now, I know what you're thinking.  Money for nothing, that makes no sense.
Why would these coins ever be worth anything.
There is where the "pay it forward" concept comes in.  All coin recipients
are encouraged to "pay it forward" ... do good for the sake of good, and
allow that karma to flow back to you.  Eventually this can take the form of
rebuying the coins that saved your life when you were young, and enabled
you to become a successful businessman.
As the value, liquidity, trust, and importantly, social good of the system
build.  So it becomes easier for people to maintain societies, for
economies to thrive, and for governments to balance their budgets.
It becomes an ever increasing virtuous circle, that can transform the
I've left out a few gaps and technical details, but I'm sure it's possible
to join the dots and incrementally move towards an optimal solution.  I
think bitcoin and the internet have paved the way for "pay it forward"
crypto currencies.
And hopefully it can one day become "an idea worth spending".  :)

Luke, if you think that the sole purpose of a URI scheme is to be used as a
URI handler, I think you've not fully understood the concept.  URIs are the
global variable of the internet, and as such the need to play nicely with
all other URI schemes on the net.  They need to be able to be linked to, to
be defined and documented.  This is important for bitcoin to get right
because bitcoin: needs to treated in a special way on the internet, I just

This is essentially name spacing.  As registries grow namespaces become
more important.  In bitcoin's quest for decentrality there's also the
question of who maintains the registry.
Some out of band algo/hash could work so long as there was a one to one
relationship between the described object and the UUID.  In this case the
gensis block may not uniquely identify a coin.
The normal way to namespace a registry on the internet is to allow it to be
a URI.  In this case an http style uri has the added bonus side effect that
it can be dereferencable and both human and machine readable.  So yes
something like org.bitcoin.* is good, just simply growing things to http

Hi All
I enuired about this and got the following reply, from the chair of the
crypto group:
Just email public-webcrypto-comments at w3.org. It's a public list. Do
definitely mention your use-cases!
I think there's issues of whether NSS etc. already support it. I think the
answer here is "no" but David can clarify. The goal is not to get browser
vendors to write new crypto code, but to expose the crypto code that
already exists.
We still have an open issue about whether "experimental" registry for
identifiers for say, new curves that aren't in the core spec, will be
maintained. So, maybe if browsers don't support it today, it's always
possible they might want to support it tomorrow given Bitcoin's growth.
Please let me know if anyone has a use case for ecdsa in the browser let me
Or if anyone would like to write to the public list that's fine
Otherwise I'll just fire off a mail and see what they come back with ...

I actually use client certificates for almost all of my authentication.
It's true that the browser manufacturers have created an UX which is not
ideal, and very little effort is made to improve it.  But it is possible.
See this project from Mozilla labs.
Unfortunately this got killed :(
More popular is the trusted third party model like OAuth or Persona.
There's a conflict of interest as well, because browser manufacturers are
often identity providers too, so there is an incentive to push TTP
There's two elements here.  One is paswordless login (which I love).  The
other is who controls your identity.  I like to control my own identity (in
my browser) using PKI.  But facebook and the big webmail providers have a
lions share of the market.
The way to shift the balance is to offer the right incentives.

Identity need not be a hard problem.  In my view it is a solved problem.
You have a real world entity translated to a digital format.  Yes that can
be slightly ambiguous at time, naming is hard, and people do get this wrong
The most common problem is to name something in a way that does not scale.
The solution to this problem is rather easy, and that is to use a URI to
name something, which makes it global and scalable.
In the case of bitcoin you could have use the bitcion URI scheme

But where are the private keys stored?  Crypto in the browser with help,
but although they will expose ECC via the NSS, I dont think bitcoin's
particular curve will be supported, because it's not NIST approved.  If the
use case was presented though, they may add it.
This can actually be done today using client side certificates.  Two
Method 1:
In your client side certificate, put in your bitcoin address in the
subjectAlternativeName field.  This is a field that lets you tell the
server "I have another identity"
previously uploaded.  This would normally be a signed value of the key
used, or a signed value of the the certificate.  The server checks this and
logs you in.
Method 2:
In your client side certificate, put in an HTTP address.  That HTTP address
contains your bitcoin address and a signed copy of your cert public key or
the cert itself.
The advantage here is that you dont need a key server.
Both methods work, I've been doing this kind of thing for 5 years+, and I'd
never go back to passwords on anything I build.
I'm all for recreating this UI in javascript too, but I just wonder how to
protect the private keys ...

Good point.
There are actually times you may want to sign a transaction.
There's a little know HTTP code, 402, "Payment Required".  We should really
start using this at some point ...
Reserved for future use.[2] The original intention was that this code might
be used as part of some form of digital cash or micropayment scheme, but
that has not happened, and this code is not usually used. As an example of
its use, however, Apple's defunct MobileMe service generated a 402 error if
the MobileMe account was delinquent.[citation needed] In addition, YouTube
uses this status if a particular IP address has made excessive requests,
and requires the person to enter a CAPTCHA.

Given the recent rise in value there seems to be anecdotal evidence that 1
bitcoin being so high is putting off a lot of normal buyers, because they
feel that putting down $400+ and only getting "1 coin", or having to buy in
multiples of 1 whole coin, is too much.. only after it being explained that
they can buy fractional amounts to they regain interest, apparently
happening increasingly.
Straw Poll
6 months ago there was a straw poll on this
Roughly 2/3 of respondents favoured switching
A further 20% said to switch after it hits 1000
Satoshi's comments:
Eventually at most only 21 million coins for 6.8 billion people in the
world if it really gets huge.
But don't worry, there are another 6 decimal places that aren't shown, for
a total of 8 decimal places internally.  It shows 1.00 but internally it's
1.00000000.  If there's massive deflation in the future, the software could
show more decimal places.
If it gets tiresome working with small numbers, we could change where the
display shows the decimal point.  Same amount of money, just different
convention for where the ","'s and "."'s go.  e.g. moving the decimal place
3 places would mean if you had 1.00000 before, now it shows it as 1,000.00.
Would now be a good time to start thinking about changing the default
display in the software.  Perhaps initially it could be a dropdown display
option, then at some point mbtc becomes the default?

As a data point, the price of bitcoin has gone up roughly 1000x since

Create a new genesis block for a staging network, but in all other aspects,
as far as possible, keep the properties the same as bitcoin.
Do not actively be opposed to it being traded, but people need to know
that, although there is no intention to reset the chain, new and
potentially not fully tested, changes can be rolled into the network.
Anyone mining staging coins should be prepared for the value to go to zero.
Perhaps also a "straw poll" voting system could be set up for those that
own staging coins could sign messages saying which patches they would like
to test out next.  When patches are stable in the staging area, they could
be "promoted" to the main net ...

Hi All
Sorry for the delay on this.  I've made a very simple start, and am hosting
the vocabulary at.
Having chatted on IRC, I'm not only going to model bitcion, but all crypto
currencies in time, starting first with bitcoin.  There's only one use case
currently support, which is a way to tell the semantic web that a link is a
bitcoin address (I know you can already introspect on the bitcoin: link but
introspection requires out of band knowledge).  More explanation below:
*Use Case
As a publisher Alice would like to link her web page content (or app) to a
bitcoin address, so that donations can be received by those that have
enjoyed her work.
It's only a slight overhead to model all crypto currencies so perhaps the
model will be something like
URI -> crypto-currency-address -> bitcoin-address
The folks at w3id.org have kindly offered to user their permanent
identifier switchboard, then we redirect to a locked down vocabulary.
As an implementer you simply need to add a single rel= tag to your markup.
*Example Usage*
In a web page:
<*meta* rel="
href="bitcoin:1234...." />
In an html5 app:
*Note: you an provide context for an individual concept in HTML5 (as
opposed to the webpage itself), such as an app, a project, a person, but
using the  tag.
For litecoins (coming soon)
*Next Steps
It's just a small step to start with, can allow all sorts of entities to
start accepting bitcoin in a way that complies with the W3C best
practices.  I'll be improving and extending this over time, feedback or
help is welcome!

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] A critique of bitcoin open source 
Im sympathetic to some of the points, but it seems slightly harsh.  I do
agree that we're lucky to have the excellent leadership of Gavin, who I
think is a great role model.
Perhaps the bitcoin community is at a size where it may benefit from a
loose code of conduct.  The ubuntu code of conduct has been excellent in
this respect, in helping to grow that community:
Ubuntu Code of Conduct v2.0
Ubuntu is about showing humanity to one another: the word itself captures
the spirit of being human.
We want a productive, happy and agile community that can welcome new ideas
in a complex field, improve every process every year, and foster
collaboration between groups with very different needs, interests and
We gain strength from diversity, and actively seek participation from those
who enhance it. This code of conduct exists to ensure that diverse groups
collaborate to mutual advantage and enjoyment. We will challenge prejudice
that could jeopardise the participation of any person in the project.
The Code of Conduct governs how we behave in public or in private whenever
the project will be judged by our actions. We expect it to be honored by
everyone who represents the project officially or informally, claims
affiliation with the project, or participates directly.
We strive to:
Be considerate
Our work will be used by other people, and we in turn will depend on the
work of others. Any decision we take will affect users and colleagues, and
we should consider them when making decisions.
Be respectful
Disagreement is no excuse for poor manners. We work together to resolve
conflict, assume good intentions and do our best to act in an empathic
fashion. We don't allow frustration to turn into a personal attack. A
community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive
Take responsibility for our words and our actions
We can all make mistakes; when we do, we take responsibility for them. If
someone has been harmed or offended, we listen carefully and respectfully,
and work to right the wrong.
Be collaborative
What we produce is a complex whole made of many parts, it is the sum of
many dreams. Collaboration between teams that each have their own goal and
vision is essential; for the whole to be more than the sum of its parts,
each part must make an effort to understand the whole.
Collaboration reduces redundancy and improves the quality of our work.
Internally and externally, we celebrate good collaboration. Wherever
possible, we work closely with upstream projects and others in the free
software community to coordinate our efforts. We prefer to work
transparently and involve interested parties as early as possible.
Value decisiveness, clarity and consensus
Disagreements, social and technical, are normal, but we do not allow them
to persist and fester leaving others uncertain of the agreed direction.
We expect participants in the project to resolve disagreements
constructively. When they cannot, we escalate the matter to structures with
designated leaders to arbitrate and provide clarity and direction.
Ask for help when unsure
Nobody is expected to be perfect in this community. Asking questions early
avoids many problems later, so questions are encouraged, though they may be
directed to the appropriate forum. Those who are asked should be responsive
and helpful.
Step down considerately
When somebody leaves or disengages from the project, we ask that they do so
in a way that minimises disruption to the project. They should tell people
they are leaving and take the proper steps to ensure that others can pick
up where they left off.
Leadership, authority and responsibility
We all lead by example, in debate and in action. We encourage new
participants to feel empowered to lead, to take action, and to experiment
when they feel innovation could improve the project. Leadership can be
exercised by anyone simply by taking action, there is no need to wait for
recognition when the opportunity to lead presents itself.
Delegation from the top
Responsibility for the project starts with the "benevolent dictator", who
delegates specific responsibilities and the corresponding authority to a
series of teams, councils and individuals, starting with the Community
Council ("CC"). That Council or its delegated representative will arbitrate
in any dispute.
We are a meritocracy; we delegate decision making, governance and
leadership from senior bodies to the most able and engaged candidates.
Support for delegation is measured
Nominations to the boards and councils are at the discretion of the
Community Council, however the Community Council will seek the input of the
community before confirming appointments.
Leadership is not an award, right, or title; it is a privilege, a
responsibility and a mandate. A leader will only retain their authority as
long as they retain the support of those who delegated that authority to
We value discussion, data and decisiveness
We gather opinions, data and commitments from concerned parties before
taking a decision. We expect leaders to help teams come to a decision in a
reasonable time, to seek guidance or be willing to take the decision
themselves when consensus is lacking, and to take responsibility for
The poorest decision of all is no decision: clarity of direction has value
in itself. Sometimes all the data are not available, or consensus is
elusive. A decision must still be made. There is no guarantee of a perfect
decision every time - we prefer to err, learn, and err less in future than
to postpone action indefinitely.
We recognise that the project works better when we trust the teams closest
to a problem to make the decision for the project. If we learn of a
decision that we disagree with, we can engage the relevant team to find
common ground, and failing that, we have a governance structure that can
review the decision. Ultimately, if a decision has been taken by the people
responsible for it, and is supported by the project governance, it will
stand. None of us expects to agree with every decision, and we value highly
the willingness to stand by the project and help it deliver even on the
occasions when we ourselves may prefer a different route.
Open meritocracy
We invite anybody, from any company, to participate in any aspect of the
project. Our community is open, and any responsibility can be carried by
any contributor who demonstrates the required capacity and competence.
A leader's foremost goal is the success of the team.
"A virtuoso is judged by their actions; a leader is judged by the actions
of their team." A leader knows when to act and when to step back. They know
when to delegate work, and when to take it upon themselves.
A good leader does not seek the limelight, but celebrates team members for
the work they do. Leaders may be more visible than members of the team,
good ones use that visibility to highlight the great work of others.
Courage and considerateness
Leadership occasionally requires bold decisions that will not be widely
understood, consensual or popular. We value the courage to take such
decisions, because they enable the project as a whole to move forward
faster than we could if we required complete consensus. Nevertheless,
boldness demands considerateness; take bold decisions, but do so mindful of
the challenges they present for others, and work to soften the impact of
those decisions on them. Communicating changes and their reasoning clearly
and early on is as important as the implementation of the change itself.
Conflicts of interest
We expect leaders to be aware when they are conflicted due to employment or
other projects they are involved in, and abstain or delegate decisions that
may be seen to be self-interested. We expect that everyone who participates
in the project does so with the goal of making life better for its users.
When in doubt, ask for a second opinion. Perceived conflicts of interest
are important to address; as a leader, act to ensure that decisions are
credible even if they must occasionally be unpopular, difficult or
favourable to the interests of one group over another.
This Code is not exhaustive or complete. It is not a rulebook; it serves to
distill our common understanding of a collaborative, shared environment and
goals. We expect it to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter.

IETF is great for some things.  I think the bitcoin URI scheme is being

Given that crypto currencies are a relatively new field, I am unsure the

At this point bitcoin is small enough for this to not be a huge issue, but
one day that may change (maybe we hope!).
So my idea is to voluntarily pre empt legislation by giving donations to
govt (aka taxation) for bitcoin service providers.
However, there is something of a problem with voluntary donations.  Most
people are not satisfied with the way they are spent.  In the UK a recent
survey said that only 18% of people thought that tax money was wisely
spent.  This is bad for govt., bad for people, and bad for the trusted

10% of my profits to society.  But let's say I dont want that money to go
to wars of aggression, but rather, to the fire de[department.
So we set up a smart contract that is only "cashable" if the money goes to
the right place (verified by an oracle).
At this point everyone wins.  The business person is happy to make a
contribution.  The govt. is happy that it gets more revenue.  The fire
dept. is happy that it has revenue to do its work.  And everything has gone
to the right place in a kind of democratic way.
Over time if it takes off, this could provide revenue for many essential
services that are needed by people, in a way that allows more democratic
freedom of choice.
So my question is whether it may be possible to use smart contracts to
achieve a better democracy that is good for people, good for govt, and good
for innovation?  My hope is that the answer is ...

IANA normally register ports with the principle of conservation in mind.
See section 7.2 of RFC6335 for more details.
8333 and 18333 are currently unassigned, which is good news.
Ideally it would be good to have two ports, one for the main net, and one
for the test net.  However, in light of conservation only one may be
granted.  The question as to whether traffic could be multiplexed over a
single port may be raised.

Here's a quote from Satoshi when the mining arms race began:
"We should have a gentleman?s agreement to postpone the GPU arms race as
long as we can for the good of the network. It?s much easer to get new
users up to speed if they don?t have to worry about GPU drivers and
compatibility. It?s nice how anyone with just a CPU can compete fairly
equally right now."

A couple of points:
1. bitcoinity already switched to mbtc aka millitbits (
 ) and it was positively recieved, they
got quite a few donations
2. If you watch Gavin's talk at the CFR he suggests the community comes to

Fair point, but you need to understand that all specs created by the W3C
are committed to be royalty free.  That's why there's a CLA, but I can
totally see if you or your employer feels uncomfortable with that.  You
might have the best possible interests, but not everyone may be as honest.
Personally, have participated as an unaffiliated volunteer and hobbyist at
the W3C for a few years, I've never seen an issue with this.  In fact, I'm
really happy that they have a bullet proof intellectual property framework
that guarantees all my contributions will never be encumbered by patents or

This is a good point, imho.  Miner sophistication has increased drastically
in 2 years.  Sites like (  ) can heavily influence
mining, 1-2 orders of magnitude on significant levels of hashing.
I think this is more prevalent with scrypt than sha256, litecoin is set to
half reward in 9 months, and it will be interesting to observe what happens

Yes that is an interesting data point, but it's really hard to find
comparables to doge, and most of its hashing is now merge mined with
litecoin.  Comparing doge to btc may be a case of apples and oranges.

Firstly, apologies in coming in late to the conversation.  As I am also
working on a REST API for electronic coins.  Some questions:
1. Is there a BIP, or some other doc (e.g. gist), outlining the REST output
e.g. the response format and MIME types.  Or just compile from source?
2. How set in stone is v1 of the the going forward?  PS I support comments re: "/api/v1/" -- tho I guess it is too late for that now.
3. Would there be any support to develop this interface into something that
would be W3C standards compliant, or reviewed by the REST community.  So
for example a context can be provided to self document the terms (something
I've almost completed) and would allow standardization of block explorer
and bitcoind outputs.  Right now every explorer seems to have a different
JSON output.
Great work!  Looking forward to seeing this go live and how it devlops!

============================== START ==============================
A very well written paper, thank you for putting it together and sharing.
Given it's the 6 year birthday of satoshi's white paper, I just read
through it again.
I find it interesting that bitcoin is never defined in Satoshi's paper,
indeed, it never appears after the first word.
The term Electronic Coin is defined.
The terminology of bitcoin / altcoin / altchain / blockchain in this paper
still leaves me slightly uneasy, and I try to use the terms electronic coin
and electronic cash, more often.
If satoshi were to come back and continue his work, would it be an altcoin,
would it be "The" blockchain, would it be bitcoin, or would what we know as
bitcoin become an alt.  I suspect these questions are nothing more than
academic curiosity.
But I think I'll get more used to it over time :)
In any case, happy birthday "bitcoin" :)

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Concerns Regarding Threats by a Developer 
Bicoin is not like other projects.  There are large financial stakes
involved.  I was at a standards convention once and the head of standards
at a large company joked to me:
"We know there are 6 people in the standards world that we can never buy.
So we just buy everyone else".
You have to luck out in a huge way to get a person like that running your
project.  Linux has done.  Id say bitcoin has been lucky there too.  But
have a look at other projects, have a look at the alts, the *last* thing
you want is a dictator in may cases.
Ultimately bitcoin is a ledger based on consensus.  There are 3 branches,
the miners, the protocol and the market.  They all play a role in
regulating bitcoin and generally on the conservative side (which I think is
a good thing).  Whatever your view on the 20MB change, it's not a
*conservative* approach, which is the approach that has served bitcoin very
well so far.
So bitcoin is not like other open source projects, and that's probably
quite a good thing.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Long-term mining incentives 
I am guided here by Satoshi's paper:
"Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial
institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic
payments. While the system works well enough for *most transactions*"
This suggests to me that most tx will occur off-block with the block chain
used for settlement.  Indeed Satoshi was working on a trust based market
before he left.
If commerce works well enough off-block with zero trust settlement
supporting it, people might even forget that the block chain exists, like
with gold settlement.  But it can be used for transactions.  To this end I
welcome higher fees, so that the block chain becomes the reserve currency
of the internet and is used sparingly.
But as Gavin pointed out, bitcoin is still an experiment and we are all
still learning.  We are also learning from alt coin mechanisms.  I am
unsure there is huge urgency here, and would lean towards caution as
bitcoin infrastructure rapidly grows.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Total fees have almost crossed the block reward 
I asked adam back at hcpp how the block chain would be secured in the long
term, once the reward goes away.  The base idea has always been that fees
would replace the block reward.
At that time fees were approximately 10% of the block reward, but have now
reached 45%, with 50% potentially being crossed soon
While this bodes well for the long term security of the coin, I think there
is some legitimate concern that the fee per tx is prohibitive for some use
cases, at this point in the adoption curve.
Observations of segwit adoption show around 10% at this point
Watching the mempool shows that the congestion is at a peak, though it's
quite possible this will come down over the long weekend.  I wonder if this
is of concern to some.
I thought these data points may be of interest and are mainly FYI.  Though
if further discussion is deemed appropriate, it would be interesting to
hear thoughts.

@_author: Melvin Carvalho 
@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Total fees have almost crossed the block reward 
Just following up on this, for no other reason than I've had my eyes glued
to these stats the last few weeks.  I'll share a few more stats links.
Mempool has come down significantly, as have fees.  Tho, of course, this
could spike any time.
Typically fees are :
 $2.06 on tx $543 (median) # 0.38%
 $3.47 on tx $75,000 (mean) # 0.005%
Aside: An observation on this.  High value transactors seems to be getting
a much better deal, than the mean.  This lead me to ponder whether the
intuitive metric of satoshi/byte is, in fact, game theory optimal.
Possibly over the short term it is, but over a longer period, those wishing
to increase the longevity of proof of work in general might wish to
consider more progressive fee approaches.  Naively, it might be possible to
imagine some kind of gaussian distribution that picks tx according to a
blended combination of sats/byte and %transacted.  Perhaps something for
miners and fee estimation algorithms to develop over time.
Segwit adoption has increased, and anecdotal evidence shows that trend to
continue.  The release of 0.16 will I think also have a positive effect.
Finally, I came across this wonderful site that shows lightning network
adoption on mainnet
LN is increasing well.  Some blocks are not far off 1% lightning funding,
which I think bodes well.  I'll go out on a limb and predict that over 1%
of btc tx will be lightning based by year end.
Since such posts are not strictly development, I'll keep them to a
minimum.  However, I hope these stats provide useful data points for
project evolution.

Crypto algorithms have a lifetime, and consensus is no different.
Is it likely to be more than a few years?  Yes.
Is likely to be less than a few hundred years.  Yes.
Every algorithm involves trade offs and it's the job of a thoughtful dev
team to examine those trade offs and come to a consensus optimal solution.
This field is only 9 years old, and there is a large amount of R & D in
this area.  So we can evaluate what seems to working better and what seems
to be working worse, transfer that to BIPs, create code, test it, try to
achieve consensus.  The normal path that has served free software projects

This seems a little arbitrary.  Ask yourself, "Why the USD?".  Yes, it is

You could make equally an argument to denominate in euros.  Or a basket of
currencies, or even the Bancor.
However the wider question is why even denominate in fiat at all?
I suggest denominating the minimum value in satoshsis themselves, which
would be a negligable upgrade to the network.
