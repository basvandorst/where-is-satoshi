(Add a method for removing a
single wallet tx)
Hi All,
I am hoping there are some who would like to review/test this pull request.
Basically it enables a user to zap individually those pesky zombie
transactions that were popping up a couple of months ago.
Best regards,

You seem to be conflating bitcoin with blockstream/liquid. Your question
does not make sense.
Yes. I am sure that was always their plan in order to stay a viable
commercial entity

You could make the same argument about changetip, coinbase, bitstamp or any
other entity that operates off chain transactions.
1) There is probably no way of blocking them or enforcing fee collection
from entities that operate off chain transactions
2) They all have to settle on chain eventually
