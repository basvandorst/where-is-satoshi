@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Implementing trading across chains 
Hi, you may be interested in a couple of related projects.
Colored coins uses satoshis to represent smart property, shares, IOUs
of another currency...Colored coins can be atomically traded for
bitcoin. If you implement the trade across chains contract they would
also be tradeable for another chain currencies like namecoin or
Ripple is a concept by which people that trust each other on a network
are able to pay with IOUs transitively. It has a new p2p
implementation  that is still on development. The new implementation
is very similar to bitcoin in certain senses but it has no mining.
Bitcoin IOUs can be traded there.
Good luck with the implementation, this is a good feature to have,
even if it's not on the main client.

Well, if it's even possible to trade across "chains" with Ripple (and
I don't know of any reason shouldn't be), you will have to wait to the
release of the full node (validator) code, for now only a javascript
web client is open sourced. But it seems they at least have plans for
contracts judging from the wiki:

Just create a new wallet and send everything to a new address.
I don't think additional tools for this are needed.

As said on the bitcointalk thread, I think this is the wrong approach.
This way you effectively disable legitimate use cases for payments
that "are worth" less than the fees like smart property/colored coins.
While the transactions pay fees, they should not be considered spam
regardless of how little the quantities being moved are.
Then your only concern are unspent outputs and comparing fees with
values doesn't help in any way. Just activate a non-proportional
demurrage (well, I won't complain if you just turn bitcoin into
freicoin, just think that non-proportional would be more acceptable by
most bitcoiners) that incentives old transactions to be moved and
destroys unspent transactions with small amounts that don't move to
another address periodically. This has been proposed many times before
too, and I think it makes a lot more sense.

"The Bitcoin network will destroy your coins IF you don't move your coins"
Is pretty different. By the way, doesn't have to destroy them, can
just give them to miners.
In any case, what's wrong with my reasoning?
Smart property/colored coins are not spam transactions because they pay fees.
The problem for the network are not transactions that move less coins
than they pay fees, but old UNSPENT OUTPUTS. So why don't you focus on
that instead of a formula to check what transactions make "economic
I even prefer the sudden "destruction" (or re-generation by miners) of
the account after the X period (killerstorm's proposal) instead of
just rejecting great potential use cases for the chain.
I mean, I still prefer a small fixed demurrage fee after those X
blocks without moving them, but since this community is demurrage
allergic and that possibility cannot even be considered (doesn't
matter what reflects better the costs for miners/the network I guess),
I'll go with the second best option IMO.
This would be just a fee for a resource that users are enjoying and
has real costs for the network. Why would constant demurrage fees
after a free storage period would be perceived so different from
transaction fees?
I haven't heard anyone complaining about "the bitcoin developers are
destroying part of YOUR coins every time you move them!!"

Unless of course everlasting physical "bitcoins" are much more
important than smart property and colored coins...

Well, my initial idea was that nothing was really needed too.
But if something must be done, I dislike very much the "ban
micropayments" approach. I was just offering other solutions that I
consider much better, but if nothing is done I won't be pushing for
those alternative solutions (to a problem that we may not even have).

That solution seems good enough to me.
Smartcoin users would just need to move their assets before 10 years,
totally acceptable.
And regular users don't need to think about it since they're probably
always sending more than they pay in fees.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Can this tx be formed? 
Say Alice signs and broadcasts a tx with input Ai, with SIGHASH_SINGLE
to Ao and SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY
Bob signs and broadcasts a tx with input Bi, with SIGHASH_SINGLE to Bo
and SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY
Can Carol complete the tx so that it is valid to be published in the chain?
It only has to make Ai + Bi + Ci + F = Ao + Bo + Co
but it all must be contained in a single transaction.

They have a vested interested in bitcoin's success. Can't they be
asked to suspend their operations temporarily until the new hard-fork
is properly prepared?
I thought they have stopped them already.

A related question...some people mentioned yesterday on that 0.5 appeared to be compatible with 0.8.
Was that only for the "fatal block" and would have forked 0.8 later
too or is it something else?
I'm having a hard time understanding this 0.5 thing, if someone can
bring some light to it I would appreciate it.
Thanks in advance

I'm not sure I understand your proposal, but its sounds good.
Can you elaborate with an example?
Are you considering colored coins/smart property?
