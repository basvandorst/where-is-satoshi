@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] PSBT_GLOBAL_XPUB: Version bytes in xpub 
What?s the rational for including the version bytes in the xpub in the
GLOBAL_XPUB field? This was briefly touched upon in an earlier email from
Stepan, but I don?t think it was every fully addressed.
I am not sure if we need the whole xpub or keeping chain_code and
The version bytes seem to be superfluous data considering the transaction
format and the rest of the PSBT key-values are network agnostic. If we
wanted to attach network data to the PSBT then I think that would be better
served by using a new key.
There is also a potential issue where we could have conflicting versions on
different xpubs in the PSBT. If we remove the version bytes then we can
eliminate this possibility.
I haven?t formed an opinion on whether or not the other data outside of the
public key and chain code should be included, but I think it would be good
to discuss any rational for either including it or omitting it.
