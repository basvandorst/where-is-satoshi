I dont like the idea of putting the min fee in the hands of the receiver.
Seems like that will work against the best interests of senders in the long
Why not try a different path of calculating the min fee like difficulty
retarget. You can analyse the last 2016 blocks to find the average fee
accepted per kb (which would include transactions that were included
without fees) and then write that into the block as a soft recommendation
that wallets could use in the UI. This way the price can vary up and down
according to what people were willing to spend on fees and miners willing
to accept.
I absolutely do not trust vendors to set fees. I think it has to be based
on what senders are willing to pay and what miners are willing to accept.

I respectfully disagree. Senders need their funds to be received. The
incentive is right there. Miners want mining fees. So if you want to pay
for something, you need to make sure payment arrives. Senders know that if
they exclude the fee it might not arrive at all. Miners increasingly ignore
no or low fees. So those two agents together ensure there is a fee more
than not. If what you said was true, we would hardly see fees being paid at
all, but on the contrary we see lots of fees, and much higher than the
minimum 0.0001/kb rate that is currently required.
Merchants will just include ridiculous fees - there are some exchanges that
do it already - MtGox being the famous example requires a 0.001 fee 10x
higher than the network rate - the CEO does it because he says "it's
better". That's not a fee going to MtGox, that is the miner fee and they
have no plans to reduce it.
Typically vendor software may not get updated and or lag behind with fat
fees never decreasing or decreasing way too slowly - it's just not fluid or
dynamic enough when it rests with the vendor.
However, receivers do want a fee attached,
No - receivers want to be paid. If they are not paid they wont dispatch the
goods or service. Neither party is happy in that circumstance. The
incentive that the payment confirms is there naturally.
Miners cant lie about fees accepted because that's part of the transaction.
When Alice sends funds to Bob it includes the fee information and that is
included in the block. There is no way to fake it. The average fee paid is
provable - so there is no need to query nodes at all, you simply look at
the blockchain. You dont even need to write it into the blockchain since it
can be calculated from the blockchain, it would just make it simpler.

@_author: Drak 
@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Floating fees and SPV clients 
Yes, that's the other problem with a merchant setting a fee - they have no
idea how large the transaction might be. If you spend a bunch of dust the
fee could be 2 or 3x the expected fee. Then you might get merchants
including higher fees by default to account for this. That means we end up
paying more per kb over time.

@_date: 2013-12-03 12:05:21
@_author: Drak 
@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Floating fees and SPV clients 
Refunds in this circumstance would be problematic because someone is going
to lose because they have to pay the fee. If the sender's money is refunded
minus the fee, they will be unhappy. And the merchant will be unhappy about
having had an unacceptable transaction they have to send back, and eat a
fee for the privilege.
This kind of situation needs to be avoided at all costs.

Malicious actors with root access to the server is another issue entirely.
Sure it's a problem, but it is not an argument not to have a properly
signed SSL certificate.
With out one, the exploit can be performed on routers to redirect traffic
through a third party alter the content of the site (like the links on
bitcoin.org to various wallet projects) and then onto the correct
destination. SSL at least mitigates that. For example it would be trivial
to impersonate Electrum's site or whatever, "change" the link on the fly
that appears on the trusted source bitcoin.org via BGP redirection. Now
users will be directed to the scammers site which could be identical except
for domain name and of course malicious binaries.
BGP redirection is a reality and can be exploited without much
expense/effort. MITM is a real world threat, not some theoretical
possibility - reports show it's happening on an unprecedented scale. SSL is
essential - that's a no-brainer. Sure other measures are important, but
without SSL there is almost no point to any of the other options.
SSL is so considered so important that the *HTTP 2.0 spec might be SSL

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Dedicated server for bitcoin.org, 
Let me clarify. SSL renders BGP redirection useless because the browser
holds the signatures of CA's it trusts: an attacker cannot spoof a
certificate because it needs to be signed by a trusted CA: that's the point
of SSL, it encrypts and proves identity, the latter part is what thwarts
MITM. If there was an MITM the browser screams pretty loudly about it with
a big threat warning interstitial.

Simple verification relies on being able to answer the email sent to the
person in the whois records, or standard admin/webmaster@ addresses to
prove ownership of the domain. This is a good point to note -
bitcoin.orgshould not get a simple certificate, but one that requires
verification for the person/org who is applying. They are more expensive.
You cannot MITM SSL connections - it will cause a browser warning.
I do not have the means, but it has been demonstrated some people are
performing BGP redirections, daily, and on a massive scale... and it's a
problem, because BGP was designed on implicit trust.
You are right that the CA system is not full-proof, one CA was caught
issuing a bogus certificate on purpose a while back, I forgot the name but
it resulted in CA certificate revokation and the entire company being
blacklisted from Firefox and Google Chrome forever - basically a summary
corporate execution. I personally imagine the CIA or other state actor
could just quietly buy up an already trusted CA and abuse them. But it's
clear, people are watching, and if a CA is caught once, that's the end of
their business forever: Firefox and Google demonstrated that. The strategy
is possibly too expensive and risky to carry off which is maybe why they
don't do it.
What has been noted with all the Snowden leaks, and with the Lavabit case,
the security agencies did not get bogus certificates issued, they still got
court orders, or other deception to get hold of the encryption certificates
of their targets instead of issuing their own so they could listen in.
The CA system is not full proof, but it is what we have. Similar arguments
have been made against the use of identity certificates for bitcoin, but
that hasnt stopped it's inclusion in the bitcoin payment protocol.
Anyway, I take your points, but this is an area I am quite passionate about
so it's important for me to be clear.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Fees UI warning 
Not sure if this is the right place, but since a few wallet authors
congregate here I though it might be the best place.
It seems every once in a while you see stories of people accidentally
paying huge fees. Today I read about a man who paid a 20.14BTC fee for a
0.05 BTC transaction[1], oops. There was another recently where someone
paid a fee of about 200BTC which fortunately the pool operator refunded.
It just occurs to me this kind of sad story could be averted if wallets
implemented a confirmation box if the fee amount seems crazy - for example,
if it's >10x what the default fee should be, or if it's greater than x% of
the sending amount. "the fee seems unusually high, are you really sure you
want to pay X in fees?"
I realise the exact details of this might need to be fleshed out given we
want flexible fees, but it should be pretty simple to agree with what looks
like an unusually large fee according to the going rate.

It's great to see the many ways wallet authors try to protect users from
easy to make mistakes, especially against losing funds.
But this issues isn't confined to custom transaction - some wallet
implementations have a fee field and almost all wallets allow the fee rate
to be configured in preferences. Sanity checking is sensible where a user
can override the calculated fee. Some wallets don't allow the fee to be
adjusted at all, but quite a few do.

Can you add a part about SHOULD/MUST warn users if the fee is unusually
high to avoid sob-stories of people sending 20BTC fees with for the

Sourcecode MUST be PGP signed on a regular basis. Releases MUST be
"SHOULD be cryptographically signed" I assume.
Once could make efforts to publish (maybe even as signed commits in the git
repo etc the current valid certificate fingerprints and which CA signed
it). This would go some way to exposing
MITM either by CA or in workplaces where browsers are loaded with bogus CAs
for the purpose
of deep packet inspection.
According to RFC 2119  language, you
might be better using the word RECOMMENDED or MAY over SHOULD here.

How does signing the commit message itself help at all since it just signs
the commit message, not the content of the commit. You could commit some
code then I. Then I squash my commits into yours and use your commit
message. You could also include the previous commit hash in your commit
But correct me if I am wrong, but that would be difficult (if not
impossible) to verify once you get into merging code since the patch can be
merged in at another point in history entirely.. and still doesn't work
because I can still squash commits into yours. I don't see how it can work
at all unless I am missing something obvious (which I fear I may be?).
I also don't believe Linus is talking just from the perspective of how the
kernel project works. The integrity of a git repository is maintained by
the hash chaining and by the distributed nature of the repository. If
someone hacked github and changed the history of the tree, the next time
you tried to push his code up it would fail because the history had changed
- tampering is immediately obvious in git.

Has anyone seen the talk at 30c3 on the current NSA capabilities?
Specifically they are able to "beat the speed of light" between you and a
website such that if you communicate with Bob, they can sent competing
packets that will arrive before Bob's packets. They have  realtime deep
packet insertion able to inject arbitrary data into an TCP streams and can
change file downloads **on the fly**. This can be done remotely.
Sourceforge do not have https downloads, so this is yet another reason to
move downloads to somewhere that does - like github.
The NSA has the ability, right now to change every download of bitcoin-qt,
on the fly and the only cure is encryption.
Revealed as part of the presentation is the fact that if the NSA has access
to these capabilities, then so do others and in fact one of the things
revealed yesterday was independently discovered already and published.
Same goes for the bitcoin.org site - why are we dragging our feet on
installing an SSL certificate and redirecting all http to https? While no
solution is perfect, it's a lot better than zero defense.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Possible Solution To SM Attack 
If I understand the issue properly, this seems like a pretty elegant
solution: if two blocks are broadcast within a certain period of eachother,
chose the lower target. That's a provable fair way of randomly choosing the
winning block and would seem like a pretty simply patch.

@_date: 2013-11-05 23:03:13
@_author: Drak 
@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Possible Solution To SM Attack 
Well in that case, you could make it unpredictable by choosing based on a
hash of the blockhash and chose the lowest from two. There is no way for
Alice to know if Bob's resulting hash will be higher or lower than hers
since she does not know Bob's blockhash in advance and therefore she would
be better broadcasting her block immediately.
You could even add another unpredictable factor: deciding the rules of
whether higher or lower wins by hashing both competing blockhashes. If the
leading two hex digits are below 128 lower wins, and if above, higher wins.

@_date: 2013-11-05 23:44:15
@_author: Drak 
@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Possible Solution To SM Attack 
Yes, I saw the flaw as pointed out by Quinn so I then suggested two step
1. Decide high or low by taking a the leading bytes from
hash(alice)+hash(bob): above certain number we the rule is "higher wins",
below a certain number the "lower hash wins"
2. Chose winner based on the higher or lower of hash(alice) or hash(bob)
based on the rule coming from 1
Now you have a situation where you don't know the rules of the game in
advance (whether high or low wins) until the hands are already dealt nor
have any idea about how high or low Bob's hash will be since it's not based
on target anymore, but on a hash of the blockhash so it makes it a guessing
You might have an unusually high or low hash, but then you have no idea
whether higher or lower is going to win. So it is better for Alice to just
broadcast the block.
What do you think?

If "confirmation" and "n confirmations" together are problematic, I'd talk
about "cleared payments" and "n confirmations"
So "a payment clears after one confirmation, but you might want to wait
until the payment has been confirmed n times".
Then at least you are not using the same word for two different meanings
and you're using stuff more familiar in popular lexicon.

If you are talking about user interface, I don't think you have to be
technically correct. It must make sense to the user.
A user cares about his balance, and did a payment "go through", and "did my
payment arrive/clear".
The UI is for their benefit.
Maybe, but again from the user's perspective they pay someone, and they
receive money - just like you do with paypal using an email address.
The technical bits in the middle dont matter to the user and trying to crap
stuff in to be technically correct is just confusing to them.
The UI needs to be about the user and fit with his experience of the world.

I'd also like to point out the obvious: git uses the previous hash as part
of the formula to generate the current commit hash thus tampering with
history while possible would be instantly noticed because we all have
copies of the repository. Tampering would be completely evident (pushes
would fail for a start, and even simple merges would bork). It's just not
possible to tamper with the repository without it being discovered, even
with collusion (or strong arming) of github.
The social benefits of github make it idea for open source projects that
want community participation. The barrier to entry is low. The only "weak"
spot of github is the releases section, but since we don't actually
distribute Bitcoin from github the point is moot.
I think github haters fail to see the vast benefits of a social hub like
github. Their issue tracker may not be as sophisticated, it serves well and
the project is extremely productive.

I take Paypal as a reference example for subscription payments where you

I think it's pretty safe to remove it...

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Procedure for non-tech contributions 
Actually, this is unnecessary since github allows editing of files directly
on the site and the it will submit as a pull request. You can even update
by visiting your fork (it creates this automatically and a topic branch)
and make more edits and it will add to your PR. There is basically no
barrier for non techy people to contribute.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Payment Protocol Hash Comments 
OK, but certainly now, SHA-2 is available as standard in PHP and has been
since PHP 5.1.2 as part of the hash() function. You can see from usage
stats that means practically every installation
 is PHP 5.2 and above.
Unless there is some other compelling reason, I would suggest removing
SHA-1 from the specification.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Multisign payment protocol? 
I was wondering if there would be merit in a kind of BIP for a payment
protocol using multisig?
Currently, setting up a multisig is quite a feat. Users have to exchange
public keys, work out how to get the public keys from their addresses. If
one of the parties are not savvy enough, an malicious party could easily be
setup that was 2 of 3 instead of 2 of 2 where the malicious party generates
the multisig address+script and thus be able to run off with funds anyway.
It's also terribly complex to generate and keep track of. There's been a
nice attempt at creating an browser interface at coinb.in/multisig but it
still lacks the kind of ease with created by the payment protocol. If there
was a BIP then it would go a long way to aiding future usability of
multisig wallet implementations.
What are your thoughts?

You have pretty much nailed my intent in both respects. This sets up a way
to negotiate the address and abstract away the nasty details of finding
public keys from bitcoin addresses, and provides a nice clean way for
redemption abstracting away the long strings of hex.
For redemption, I think as each party signs the tx if the script returns
true, it would be acceptable to just go right ahead and broadcast it, or
maybe as you suggest all signatures go back to the initiating party and
they do the final work.
I very much like the idea of assuming each party uses HD wallets, that
certainly simplifies things greatly. I also like the use of email addresses
as a negotiation medium, but I also wonder if this could be made agnostic
in any BIP proposal so it could work with other communication mediums like
bitmessage for example (just forward thinking anonymity a little).
I definitely think there is a need for a protocol because multisig,
regardless of the application has two technically involved steps:
negotiation of an address, and redemption of any subsequently encumbered
funds. A protocol would enable different wallet implementations to
participate in such a transaction and make wide-spread use much more likely
and possible.

Can this be calculated in advance knowing the initial transaction size and
the number of signatures required? Should be quite easy to make an
estimation from that? It's probably more of an implementation detail

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] moving the default display to mbtc 
I agree with you Jeff. The unit switch needs to happen once and once only,
but that is exactly why I said the defaults really need to change in
Bitcoin-Qt since that is still the main reference implementation and it
will influence others.
Bitpay could also take the lead here and make the switch to their defaults.
That would greatly assist the uBTC movement.
Regardless of what anyone says, Bitcoin-Qt is still the main reference
implementation and the best way to encourage a change in the community at
large is for the default units to be changed here. Core devs can surely
garner enough consensus among themselves to accept and merge a PR to that
effect. That will send a message, more than anything else that can be done.
My two satoshi.

Would it make sense to pull that stuff in and add Peter with commit access
since your repo is top of the fork tree.

Yes. I think the problem is your fork has been under more development and
upstream has stalled. The problem with this is it becomes unclear which
repo is the main one as it really has become a fork and of course then
development really does fork properly which is a shame because it doesn't
nurture community contributions around the project which is really

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] DNS seeds unstable 
I am sure the failure here is probably more mundane like a a service not
restarted, or not on auto restart when server is rebooted and such like.
The dns seeder works pretty efficiently in my experience. Maybe we need
more seeders and to include the ability for zone transfers so existing
seeders can spread their records to multiple servers running standard DNS
servers like bind etc.
