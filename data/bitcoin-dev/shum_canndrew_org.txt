Hi, noob question here: Is there a long-term plan for if the block reward drops
too low to ensure the security of the network?
IIUC miners only make profit from block rewards and transaction fees, and once
the block reward drop to zero we're merely hoping that transaction fees will
keep mining expensive enough to stop a state actor or someone from buying
enough hash power to attack the network. If that's the case, should we start
making plans now to change the protocol to allow an adjustable block reward?
Here's a half-baked idea I had of how that could work: Since the block reward
dilutes the value of the currency bitcoin holders have an incentive to keep the
reward low. However, since the block reward is also (partly) what incentivizes
mining, bitcoin holders also have an incentive to keep the reward high enough
to keep the network secure. So if bitcoin holders were able to vote to decide
the block reward they "should", hypothetically, reliably choose a value that
balances these two concerns. You could implement this voting by adding an
optional extra field to every txout that signals what the holder thinks the
inflation rate should be. If the field is missing you just assume the default
value based on the current protocol. Then, whenever a new block is mined, you
take the median inflation rate of all the pre-existing utxos, weighted by the
utxo value, to calculate the block's reward.
Is this idea fundamentally broken somehow? Or are there already better ideas
for how to tackle this problem (I don't follow this list very closely)? Or is
this actually a non-issue to start with?

Hi, thanks for the replies.
I wouldn't really consider that fundamentally broken. It changes the meaning of
"bitcoin", but so does every upgrade to the protocol. The worst problem I can
see with this is that there's probably a lot of software out there which
assumes a cap of 21M. But we'd have years to find and fix those bugs.
This isn't the same thing though, economically / game-theoretically speaking.
Transaction fees are only paid when bitcoins get moved. There's no on-going
cost for people holding bitcoins (assuming they're doing their day-to-day
transactions almost entirely off-chain, which is something that's only going to
become more common). More to the point, the transaction fee is only set by the
current demand for block space. If transaction fees drop too low to maintain a
secure hash rate then people *could* willingly pay more than they need to to
get their transactions mined, but it's unlikely they will since it'd be cheaper
to just pay the minimum and hope that everyone else covers the costs of keeping
the network secure for them.
With the voting idea everyone decides what everyone pays (via dilution) to keep
the network secure. Choosing to signal a high inflation rate doesn't mean you
pay more than everyone else, just that you might shift the median, so there's
no tragedy-of-the-commons problem. Also, votes are weighted by the value of
the utxo, so people both vote and pay in proportion to the amount of bitcoin
they're holding.
Does this make sense? Or is there some game-theoretic reason I'm not seeing for
why transaction fees can never drop dangerously low in the first place?

It would also be a big change if bitcoin became unusable due to mining profits
dropping low enough for a state actor with a warehouse full of asics to mount a
51% attack and mine empty blocks all day.
All that matters is whether the long-term rate of deflation due to lost coins
is less or greater than the rate of inflation. This determines whether the
proportion of coins whose signaled inflation rate is fixed in time would tend
towards zero or one. I think it's /fairly/ safe to assume that it would remain
less. People obviously have a pretty strong incentive to not lose their coins -
particularly people who are holding massive amounts of bitcoin - and as bitcoin
becomes more mainstream, regular users will necessarily be using forms of
protection against losing their coins (whatever they might be). Contrast this
against the inflation rate which should remain high enough to prevent very
wealthy entities from being able to mount a 51% attack. What proportion of the
total market cap of bitcoin do you think your least favorite government could
plausibly be willing to spend to take down bitcoin for a month? And do you
think it's less or greater than the proportion of all bitcoins that get lost in
a month?
If we're talking about the possibility of your coin becoming worthless because
someone out there can unwind transactions at will and prevent you from spending
it then you should definitely be interested.
In your example though it's just you or the receiver paying for blocks. In that
case you're only paying for your own security and so there's no tragedy of the
commons and the system works. But once you have a thousand people putting
transactions in every block and everyone is collectively paying for everyone's
collective security then, without some mechanism to force everyone to pay their
fair share, you're inviting Moloch to the party.
Here's a better explanation than I could write of the phenomenon I'm talking
Won't a thousand bitcoin-spenders, individually paying for their transactions
but collectively paying for their security, end up falling into the same

Yes, but how does this ensure that miners get paid *enough*? Every individual
making a transaction needs the miners to get paid enough for the transaction to
be meaningful, but they each individually only have the incentive to pay the
market rate for block space which is set purely by supply and demand.
It's the same as the fish farming analogy. Everyone making a transaction could
collectively decide how much miners need to get paid and agree to split the
costs. But then each individual has the incentive to renege on the agreement
and only pay the minimum they need to get their transaction included in the
block while everyone else pays for the transaction's security. My voting idea
is one potential way they could break the Nash equilibrium.
I concede that every bitcoin user pays transaction fees, if not directly then
indirectly, so whether miners get paid through transaction fees or a block
reward is irrelevant. My concern is that moving things off-chain reduces the
transaction fees by reducing demand for block-space and that this could cause
miner revenue to drop lower than what's required to keep the network secure.
Is there any good reason to think this won't happen?
