@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Draft BIP for seamless website authentication 
I've written a draft BIP description of an authentication protocol based on
Bitcoin public address.
By authentication we mean to prove to a service/application that we control
a specific Bitcoin address by signing a challenge, and that all related
data and settings may securely be linked to our session.
The aim is to greatly facilitate sign ups and logins to services and
applications, improving the Bitcoin ecosystem as a whole.
Demo website :
Classical password authentication is an insecure process that could be
solved with public key cryptography. The problem is that it theoretically
offloads a lot of complexity and responsibility on the user. Managing
private keys securely is complex. However this complexity is already being
addressed in the Bitcoin ecosystem. So doing public key authentication is
practically a free lunch to bitcoiners.
I've formatted the protocol description as a BIP because this is the only
way to have all major wallets implementing it, and because it completely
fits in my opinion the BIP "process" category.
Please read it and let me know your thoughts and comments so we can improve
on this draft.

What I'm trying to achieve, is to have a very simple way of authenticating
yourself with one Bitcoin address from your wallet.
For most of the people using Bitcoin, their wallet is on their phone.
The UX is clear and simple :
1. click on "connect with Bitcoin" (the audience is normal people)
2. flash the QRcode with your wallet (blockchain.info, mycelium, ...)
3. accept the authentication request (same style than OpenID or Facebook
4. user is autologged and identified by the chosen Bitcoin public address
It makes sense only if major wallets are supporting the protocol. If you
need to install a plugin or download a third party software, no one will do
I see only benefits for the entire ecosystem, and if I'm working on such a
proposition it is because I really need this feature.
Of course, it can be done without a BIP, I just need to convince wallet
developpers one by one to implement the feature.
But I thought it was much better to start the "official" way, so all wallet
could easily find and implement the same authentication mechanism.
I respectfully disagree. Many services require your Bitcoin address, and to
do that they artificially request an email/password to store it.
This is not about authentication as an identity (as "I'm Eric
Larcheveque"), but as in "I'm proving to you that I control this address".
Without such a standard protocol, you could never envision a pure Bitcoin
physical locker rental, or booking an hotel room via Bitcoin and opening
the door through the paying address.

This is indeed a flaw of the proposed protocol. However it really depends
in the end of the usage : you could use an auth just once, to redeem a good

using a HD wallet's deterministic seed to derive a key used for the FIDO or
SQRL systems.
This could be a very interesting approach. But I think the system which
would get critical mass is the one which would be implemented into major
Bitcoin wallets.
Why adding another app or software when you already have all you need?

I started without a BIP and the feedback I got is that I should to a BIP.
We cannot write all the code for all the wallets ; this is after all a
communauty project.
However we have and we will propose bounties for each wallet to support
natively the protocol.
Yes you are right. But if the concept of authenticating yourself gets
traction, they will probably do it.
My view on this is mainly about the UX and the fact everyone in Bitcoinland
has a wallet.
It's a approach leveraging this fact, with the possibility to build
interesting apps combining address auth and the blockchain.
I understand the problems related to multisig, contracts etc,
There is no such thing as a from address in a transaction, however many
services still take first tx as the return address.
People will always find way of building and doing stuff (cf the message in
the blockchain debate).
There is also the benefit of revocation with certificate and central
But, again, you already have a wallet and a Bitcoin address.
So if you add a simple auth protocol, people will use it at no cost.

Yes, but no one will ever install a plug in.
And all will update their wallets with the last version, including the auth
I perfectly understand all the objections, and they are very good points.
I have at least two wallets enthousiastic about the project so the protocol
will be implemented and it will give some room to experiment.
The BIP came from the idea we should formalize the standard so all wallets
could participate, and it felt more logical to come forward with it.
Maybe a better strategy would be to start "privately" with a few wallets
and services using the protocol, and to come back to the BIP there is
usability and traction.

Well, the major difference is that you could sign up effortlessy to a
service, and associate your email later.
If more people sign up to more services, it's a good thing for the
In a perfect world, you would pay your locker with a "normal" transaction.
The same way you shouldn't play satoshi dice from a shared wallet.
But your point is totaly valid, and I don't have answer to that except that
I'd love to have a Bitcoin authenticated locker in our Bitcoin co working
Bitcoin users are normaly already paying some effort to securise and backup
their wallets / keys. So it's just about leveraging that.
I would myself pick a crypto locker, because I'm the kind of guy who
Facebook connects and I follow the easiest path, even if it has long term
costs :)

I'm probably very naive, but the fact that the authentication key is your
Bitcoin address was for me a great feature :)
What are the risks associated of id yourself with a bitcoin address you
plan to use on the website for transaction ?
I mean, what is the difference between doing that, and id with a login/pass
and add your bitcoin address in a settings field ? (knowing you could
always find a mechanism to transfer the account to another bitcoin address
if needed)

If you buy a TREZOR you will of course install the plugin :)
What I mean is that normal people are lazy : if the solution is already in
their hand they will use it, if they need to install/configure something,
they won't do it.
I'm not trying to propose a solution to solve the auth on the web, but to
ease the sign up / login on the Bitcoin ecosystem websites and apps.
More sign ups to new services (whatever the services) = more usage =
expanding ecosystem = more global value to Bitcoin
Wallets are a key element of the equation because :
- everyone has one (desktop or mobile)
- everyone (in theory) has already taken all steps to backup and secure
their keys
- id yourself with a Bitcoin address often makes sense on a Bitcoin related

The development of BitID has had some progress, and we have now a working
wallet prototype based on Android Bitcoin Wallet (bitoinj).
The user flow is quite nice and if you are curious here is a short video
demonstration :
By default, each new first auth request will create and save a new address
(SQRL like). It could be based on BIP32, but this works also without.
This requires to add metadata to addresses, as described here :
It open also the fields for decentralized 2FA as well as "pay as guest"
checkout in conjonction with BIP70 payment request.
