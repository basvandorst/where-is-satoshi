Could every node do the resends? Alternatively, could we implement a TOR
like tunneling system just for the first leg of the transactions
(overkill?). Then again, maybe just a TOR gateway if that's desired.
This is a nice idea but sounds rather unreliable.
There's already an implementation of this, called UTP. If we do decide
that using UDP is worthwhile, this library is probably better than
implementing something ourselves.

No way that will happen. A fork is going to happen sooner rather than

If there was a section in the wiki for recording past suggestions, there
would be no need to say 'no'. You could instead say "We have discussed
this before, please read..." and give them a link to the page with the
relevant discussion. Of course, this would require actively forwarding
people to the wiki for discussions and having them there. I think this
would be a good idea.
That would leave this list for discussing and coordinating the
implementation of the changes that have been agreed on.
For things that have already been discussed, you could try to find the
previous discussion and add it there. But I expect for some things, new
discussion needs to be had to get it on the wiki.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] From the forums: one-confirmation attack 
This particular attack seems quite dependant on the target not using the
deposit Tx as input. I believe this whole class of attacks become
ineffective if each account has it's own separate wallet.
Also, receiving a block with a transaction that hasn't been broadcast to
the network is in itself quite suspect. Are there cases where that
happens legitimately? Perhaps in such a case, don't treat the block it
came in as a confirmation at all. Instead, start counting from the next

It doesn't have to be a valid URI. As long as the recipient (or the

a node that is not doing any checking themselves can not reliably
forward failed verifications without getting the blame for doing faulty
work. Those nodes would then have the incentive not to relay the failed
verifications. This ends up making it important to know which nodes will
be checking transactions or not so you don't isolate yourself from other
nodes that are also checking transactions.

Wouldn't it work to restrict the number of executions of OP_EVAL allowed
per transaction? That way it wouldn't allow for unlimited looping. If
there's too many OP_EVAL executions during the transaction evaluation,
just consider the transaction illegal. 3 would be enough for the
purposes people have been planning for here I think.

When I first found bitcoin, I was a bit surprised there were no paid by
community developers working on it. However, the bounties would be a
more democratic way of guiding the progress as well as allow things to
happen without a stable flow of money.
Having said that, if it's feasible, having someone hired full time to
work on the software would be great. I'm too much of a newcomer myself
to be able to provide any financial support for that though. I could
most likely contribute towards some bug bounties but if there was a bug
I'd want to offer bounty for, I'd be fixing it myself already.

Well, the bounty thing can't be automated, so, wouldn't publishing the
work you've done up to then by, for example, mailing this list, pretty
much guarantee someone else couldn't claim they fixed it all by
themselves anymore?
It could, however, end up with some quarrels about how much of the
bounty to give and to whom. Those are not nice things to have.

If there's an upper bound on the difficulty a block is accepted to have
(even if it would've passed with significantly higher difficulty), that
could solve this issue. For example, take the median (or average) of the
past 2016 blocks and don't value any new block for more than maybe 4
times as difficult as that. Don't be so hasty with that :)

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Determine input addresses of a transaction 
One possibility would be to create a peer sourced green address
implementation. That is, each user could, individually decide to trust
certain addresses as "green" and optionally, publish this trust. Basing
things on the published trust, you could dynamically, as opposed to
static hierarchies, evaluate the trustworthiness of each green address
you haven't personally decided to trust.
This would be somewhat involved implementation, though, as it would
require heavy statistical calculations.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Instant / contactless payments 
I think a reputation network is more complicated than is needed for
this. This can be solved by the market.
What is needed is a simple method for each individual user to mark
certain merchant as trusted. For example, if your device gets an
untrusted payment request, it'll make a small sound, light up the screen
and ask the user to authorize the payment. The user then has the choice
of adding the merchant to trust list, authorizing just a single
transaction or not paying (and perhaps adding to the user's publicly
shared untrusted list?).
This way, even lacking a trust architecture, only the first payment to a
merchant needs to take several seconds. If trust is granted, the next
payments will be swift.
The lack of chargebacks presents a clear risk to the customer, though,
so a need for a third party that can keep the merchants honest exists.
This opens up markets for transaction insurance companies. Even though
bitcoin transactions are final, if a transaction insurance company
offers to cover your losses in the event of fraudulent charge, the risk
is practically eliminated.
Such an insurance company would have a strong incentive to make sure the
merchants they insure for behave. Otherwise they'll suffer the losses. I
think this would result in an equally trustworthy but more decentralized
system than with credit cards.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Block Size Increase 
Having observed the customer support nightmare it tends to cause for a
small exchange service when 100% full blocks happen, I've been thinking
that the limit really should be dynamic and respond to demand and the
amount of fees offered. It just doesn't feel right when it takes ages to
burn through the backlog when 100% full is hit for a while. So, while
pondering this, I got an idea that I think has a chance of working that I
can't remember seeing suggested anywhere.
How about basing the maximum valid size for a block on the total bitcoin
days destroyed in that block? That should still stop transaction spam but
naturally expand the block size when there's a backlog of real
transactions. It'd also provide for an indirect mechanism for increasing
the maximum block size based on fees if there's a lot of fees but little
bitcoin days destroyed. In such a situation there'd be incentive to pay
someone to spend an older txout to expand the maximum. I realize this is a
rather half baked idea, but it seems worth considering.

It seems you missed my suggestion about basing the maximum block size on

I think it has potential for both scaling as well as keeping up a constant
fee pressure. If tuned properly, it should both stop spamming and increase
block size maximum when there are a lot of real transactions waiting for

such a contract is a possibility, but why would big owners give an
exclusive right to such pools? It seems to me it'd make sense to offer
those for any miner as long as the get paid a little for it. Especially
when it's as simple as offering an incomplete transaction with the
appropriate SIGHASH flags.
a part of the reason I like this idea is because it will allow stakeholders
a degree of influence on how large the fees are. At least from the surface,
it looks like incentives are pretty well matched. They have an incentive to
not let the fees drop too low so the network continues to be usable and
they also have an incentive to not raise them too high because it'll push
users into using other systems. Also, there'll be competition between
stakeholders, which should keep the fees reasonable.
I think this would at least be preferable to the "let the miner decide"
