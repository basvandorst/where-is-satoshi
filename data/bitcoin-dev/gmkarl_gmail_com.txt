I'd like to revisit the discussion of the digest algorithm used in hashcash.
I believe migrating to new hashing algorithms as a policy would
significantly increase decentralization and hence security.
I believe the impact on existing miners could be made pleasant by gradually
moving the block reward from the previous hash to the next (such that both
are accepted with different rewards).  An appropriate rate could possibly
be calculated from the difficulty.
You could develop the frequency of introduction of new hashes such that
once present-day ASICs are effectively obsolete anyway due to competition,
new ones do not have time to develop.
I'm interested in hearing thoughts and concerns.

Hi ZmnSCPxj,
Thanks for your reply.  I'm on mobile so please excuse me for top-posting.
I'd like to sort these various points out.  Maybe we won't finish the whole
discussion, but maybe at least we can update wiki articles like
 with more points or
a link to conversations like this.
Everything is possible but some things take a lot of work.
You mention ASICs becoming commoditized.  I'd remind you that eventually
there will be a public mathematical breaking of the algorithm, at which
point all ASICs will become obsolete regardless.  Would you agree it would
be better to prepare for this by planning algorithm change?
You mention many coordinated hardforks.  Would you agree that if we came up
with a way of programmatically cycling the algorithm, that only one
hardfork work be needed?  For example one could ask nodes to consent to new
algorithm code written in a simple scripting language, and reject old ones
slowly enough to provide for new research.
You mention the cost of power as the major factor influencing decentralized
mining.  Would you agree that access to hardware that can do the mining is
an equally large factor?  Even without ASICs you would need the physical
cycles.  Including this factor helps us discuss the same set of expected
You describe improving electricity availability in expensive areas as a way
to improve decentralization.  Honestly this sounds out of place to me and
I'm sorry if I've upset you by rehashing this old topic.  I believe this
list is for discussing the design of software, not international energy
infrastructure: what is the relation?  There is a lot of power to influence
behavior here but I thought the tools present are software design.

Good afternoon ZmnSCPxj,
Thanks for holding your end of this discussion with me.
Sorry I am so verbose; I am still learning to communicate efficiently.
It helps to be clear about what your goals are, because any chosen solution
To be up front, the reason for decentralization is due to concern around
the security of the hashing.  Having a public breakage of the function
simply makes the urgency obvious.
Reddit claims two entities controlled 62% of the hashrate recently:
.  Compromising the systems of these two groups seems like it is all that
is needed to compromise the entire blockchain (to the limited degree a 51%
attack does).
Hence I see decentralization and cryptanalysis of the algorithm to be
roughly similar security concerns.
It sounds like you agree that a change of algorithm is needed before the
current one is publicly broken.
I'm expressing that in considering this we have two options: repeated hard
forks or making repeated change a part of the protocol.  There are many
ways to approach or implement it.  It sounds like you're noting that the
second option takes some work and care?
Would it be helpful if I outlined more ideas that address your concerns?  I
want to make sure the idea of changing the algorithm is acceptable at all
It sounds like you are saying that the supply of electricity is exhausted
and the supply of hardware is not.
Is that correct?
I've seen that most of the time mining hardware distributors are sold out
of their top-of-the-line mining equipment, mostly selling in preorders.
Are implying most of the mining is done by privately built equipment?
Would you agree that an increase in the price of bitcoin would make the
availability of hardware matter much more, because the price of electricity
would matter much less?
Something to raise here is that all of these things take time and respond
in ebbs and flows.  If there were to be a plan to migrate to a new
algorithm, it would be participating in those ebbs and flows.
It takes time to build new hardware, and it takes time for the difficulty
to adjust to obsolete it.  What do you see as influencing how fast hardware
becomes obsolete?
I ask these questions because the answers relate to how what ways would be
good to change the mining function to increase decentralization.
And expertise is easy to copy, it is only the initial expertise that is
Also takes measurable months to do.
You agreed earlier that changing the algorithm would increase
decentralization, but expressed other concerns with the idea.  Many more
general solutions are working in many altcoins.  I'm interested in
discussing changing the proof of work algorithm in bitcoin.
My motivation is security of the blockchain, which is partially held by

Hi Ariel,
Thanks for your reply.
You state that once "the entire world" can quickly find a hash that it then
"needs to be changed", but that that "won't happen in a day".
It sounds like you believe compromise of the algorithm as a concern
provides a _lot_ of time to migrate to a new hash function, and that it is
indeed important to do so when it becomes needed.
Let's talk about relaxing the time scale.  Making such plans seems more
important than agreeing on how soon they happen.  It's possible it could be
decades before having a new hash is actually needed to protect financial
security.  Who knows.
How does that land?  Is the idea more available with a looser time scale?
It seems to me with ongoing cryptanalysis research, new things like quantum
computers, conventional computer hardware always advancing, that some day
far in the future it will be easy to find an sha256 preimage on a personal
device, somehow.
Let's improve the security of the blockchain.

Hi ZmnSCPxj,
We have been addressing many concepts.  Let's try to slowly trim it down
for simplicity.
I am trying to say that both of these different things result in danger to
the integrity of the transaction log, which would be reduced by changing
the hash function.  They both have those 2 similarities.
Most human beings cannot think without constant communication with other
Thus, it is unlikely that a private break of the hash function is possible.
I disagree with you here: Andrew Wiles solved Fermat's Last Theorem in
isolation, academic research paper culture supports researching and then
publishing once you have privately developed results, and the CVE database
has 136k system vulnerabilities that were developed and shared privately
before public release, to prevent chaos.  This shows private advances in
ways to produce bitcoins are likely.
Thanks: are you saying you would support changes if they addressed the
concerns you've listed?  Or are those concerns only the tip of the iceberg,
per se?
I'm considering short-term obsolescence here.  Since hashrate rises
exponentially, only top-of-the-line hardware is competitively profitable.
If consumers who do not have the capacity to build their own hardware fast
enough to be competitive, do not have as much access to such hardware, then
their excess electricity is not being used to mine bitcoins.  A bit below
you propose spreading access via mass teaching, but I'm not aware of that
happening for now.
You could also analyze the transient economic behaviors here, specifically
I was thinking the transient changes would operate in cycles, and the
amplitude and frequency of those could be important to designing a safe
hard fork, but I think I was getting ahead of myself.  Let's move on.
Nice thoughts here on that same topic.  Thanks.
This doesn't seem relevant to me.  I'm discussing what is happening now and
what we can expect to happen from source code changes.  I don't see mining
hardware plans being taught in classrooms right now, but it sounds
interesting to try to change that if you want to change the subject of your
reply and start another thread.
Sorry if I have misrepresented those as equal.  That's not quite what I
wanted to say and is addressed farther up in this reply.
I meant that in your first reply you listed a change of the pow algorithm
as a way to ensure decentralization: "there are effectively two strategies
for ensuring decentralization".  Let's discuss ways for improving them.
More likely, any centralization seen is due to local government
Good thought.  Governments are kind of like big economic players that can
affect the spaces held by the small players.  They'll respond to the
scarcity, price, and mining rate of bitcoin, as well.  Moving on ...
Let's try to be concise and direct.
Miner decentralization supports censorship-resistance, so your motivation
No.  Ensuring a 51% attack stays or becomes completely infeasible in the
future.  See the quote at the start of this reply.  I'm thinking about
 .
The space changes given private research and/or compromise of pools.
Is it okay to pursue this?
