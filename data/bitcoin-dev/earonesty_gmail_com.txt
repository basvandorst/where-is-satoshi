@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Segwit2Mb - combined soft/hard fork - Request For 
I personally appreciate the minimal changes, and often encourage
development to be done this way - when it needs to be released quickly.
But does this need to be released quickly?
- maybe the proposal should be renamed segwit 8mb and be discussed solely
in terms of block weights.
- a high consensus hard fork is probably preferable to a low consensus soft
fork, however there is nothing to indicate that segwit as it stands isnt
already very high consensus except for a handful of pool operators
protecting fee income.
- miners who currently object to segwit while pretending to like larger
blocks will find some excuse to object to this too.
- Given the challenges miners seem to have in flipping bits, I expect any
fork that requires 95pct hash power to be vaporware.

If the primary purpose of pow is to destroy value, then a masked proof of
burn to an expanded address that assigns the private key holder the right
to mine only in the next Nth block would be sufficient.  Expanding the
address space so that addresses can only be proven invalid only with the
private key.  Miners can then not trivially game the system by excluding
tx...without killing the entire system.  ( Like POW ... miners lose many
burns since only one valid proof is deterministically selected. Difficult
adjusted upward based on the number of valid proofs per block.)
The other part of "real POW" is that miners take *time* to mine.  Proof of
destroyed value us not sufficient.  Proof of time spent is critical....
something even a masked burn cannot provide.

This is a great solution.
8 or more secure hashes, each of which can be implemented on GPU/CPU, but
rotate through them - per block round robin.
Hardware, infrastructue investment is protected.  ASIC is not.
Each pow has different tracking metrics and difficulty adjustments.  This
means the difficulty adjust will be less accurate (1/8th the samples),  but
that's never been an issue.
ASIC will never beat this - because it will be 8x more expensive to
maintain the cold circuits.
Miners with gpu/generalized hardware will always be in business.
Should be done gradually and pre-emptively.    Change one at a time on a
slow schedule, allowing a graceful transition.

It's too bad we can't make the POW somehow dynamic so that any specialized
hardware is impossible, and only GPU / FPGA is possible.
Maybe a variant of Keccak where the size of the sponge is increased along
with additional zero bits required.  Seems like this would either have to
resist specialized hardware or imply sha3 is compromised such that the size
of the sponge does not incerase the number of possible output bits as

ASIC boost is definitely a protocol vulnerability.
It makes Bitcoin resistant to current and future modifications which are
necessary to preserve decentralization.
That alone should be enough to prioritize a swift preventative measure.

One principled way to proceed would be to fault not the exploit, but
the protocol design.
Bits in the block header have been discovered which could be used for
dual meanings, and at least one meaning does not preserve the
incentive balances intended and assumed by others.  This unexpectedly
creates an incentive to block protocol improvements.  The protocol
must be repaired.
In this view, which focuses on covert-ASICBOOST, how work is done is
up to the implementation.  But if the hashing work specified possibly
could gain from blocking development work, then we have a
I believe this is clear grounds for taking action without any delay.

Seems like it would work fine.  But why would we expect 80pct to signal for

It will be contingent on some HF code that allows him to continue using
asicboost,  or is too aggressive,  or some other unreasonable request.

Instead of block thresholds, use utxo bits to coordinate size changes
(larger and smaller should be allowed).
There is no reason for miners to be involved in a decision to change this
aspects of the protocol.   Plenty of other ways to coordinate.
Otherwise someone can make it seem to a miner like 99pct of nodes are ready
for a larger weight.... even though that's false.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Drivechain -- Request for Discussion 
Seems to me an obvious use case for drive chains are to have high speed
small transactions on a side chain, eventually cleared to the main chain.
Not sure why miners would want this to fail any more than any other side
chain, like Liquid or lightning.
On May 28, 2017 5:23 PM, "Peter Todd via bitcoin-dev" <
That's not at all true. If I'm a miner with a better capability than another
miner to prevent that theft, I have reasons to induce it to happen to give
political cover to pushing that other miner off the network.
This is a very similar problem to what we had with zeroconf double-spending,
where entities such as Coinbase tried to pay off miners to guarantee
that wasn't possible in a geninely decrentralized system: safe zeroconf
Why are you forcing miners to run this code at all?
Equally, you're opening up miners to huge political risks, as rejecting all
withdrawals is preventing users' from getting their money, which gives other
miners a rational for kicking those miners off of Bitcoin entirely.
Why do you think this will be infrequent? Miners with a better ability to
validate the drivechain have every reason to make these events more
This is also a very dubious security model - I would argue that Bitcoin is
*more* valuable if miners do everything they can to ensure that drivechains
fail, given the huge risks involved. I would also argue that users should do
user-activated-soft-forks to ensure they fail.
By comparison, note Adam Back and my own efforts to ensure miners have a
smaller part in the ecosystem, with things like committed (encrypted)
transactions and my closed-seal-set/truth-list approach(1). We want to
miners as little as possible in the consensus, not more.
I have to ask: What use-cases do you actually see for drivechains? Why can't
those use-cases be done in the much safer client-side validation fashion?
