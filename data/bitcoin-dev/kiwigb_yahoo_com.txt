@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Forget dormant UTXOs without confiscating bitcoin 
The general concept has merit and the basic outline here seems sound
enough. I have harboured a notion for having "archived UTXO" for some
time, this is essentially it. The retrieval from archive cost is on the
UTXO holder not the entire storage network, which is then only bearing
full 'instant' retrieval costs for N blocks.

Under this scheme the size of the step-per-block increase could be
decreased every 210,000 blocks (at time of reward halvings). So, a linear growth rate that decreases every ~4 years, ultimately
grandfathering max_block_size increases on the same block-schedule that
reward decreases.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] [Bulk] Re: Proposed additional options 
This seems like a good place to add in an idea I had about
partially-connected nodes that are able to throttle bandwidth demands.
While we will be having partial-blockchain nodes with a spectrum of
storage options the requirement to be connected is somewhat binary, I
think many users manually throttle by turning nodes on/off already with
a minimum to just keep the chain up to date. A throttling option would
leverage on bitcoin's asychronous design to reduce bandwidth demands for
weaker nodes.
So throttling to allow for a spectrum of bandwidth connectivity:
1) an option for the user -throttle=XXX that would allow the user to
specify a desirable total bandwidth XXX in Gbytes/day the bitcoin client
can use.
2) the client reduces the number of continuous connections, transaction
or block relaying to achieve the desired throttling rate
3) it could do this by being partially connected throughout the duty
cycle or cycling the node on/off for a percentage of a 24(?) hr period
4) have an auto setting where some smart traffic management 'just takes
care of it' and manual settings that can be user configured
5) reduces minimum requirement for any 24(?) hr period it has received a
full copy of all blocks to remain fully-validating
Not sure if anyone has bought such an idea forward or if there are
obvious holes, so pre-emptive apologies for time-wasting if so.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Block Size Increase Requirements 
Linear growth is indeed the 'simplest' model for growth so removes
concerns of complexity using such a growth model. Seems like it might be
a safe compromise between exponential growth, zero growth and buys some
time to observe the longer term scale network behaviour. A simple linear growth 'hard' technical limit could also be used
conjunction with the simple periodic soft dynamic limit adjustment (e.g.
1.5x of moving average) as discussed recently. So that the combination
provides for growth, with fee pressure, up until if/when the technical
hard limit is hit. And if we keep hitting the hard limit that signals a
market demand for ancillary layers to be built out, that has been
missing until now.

Aren't you calculating bandwidth for a singly-connected node? A "highly
connected" miner could have 30-100 node connections so you probably need
to increase your traffic estimates by that factor.
I.e. For 100MB blocks, 30-100 Mbps and $60-$100 per day data costs.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Weekly development meetings on IRC 
Although the planning for this a bit far along now, one consideration I
might add from experience on working with other transglobal IT projects
is the effect of timezones on local mood/alertness/awareness etc. The
guys at 9am pinging on their first coffee in the antipodes will be in a
different mindset than those at 21:00 in Europe, and this is
unavoidable. What is possible is to schedule the meeting every other
week at a time that is better for the "other" half, whoever that might
be. This comes at the cost of not having an exactly same time set every

It's controversial not contriversial.
And it isn't controversial except among a small clique, which you seem
to be the sole representative of here. It might be time to consider
unsubscribing (again) if you don't seem to know when to shut up and the
moderators are letting you go on an inappropriate crusade here.

hype/hysteria about "everybody" must immediately upgrade to 0.16.3
currently being spread on the forums/reddit?
I don't see any effort to correct this misinformation either.
