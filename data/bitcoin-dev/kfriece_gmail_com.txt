@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Analysis paralysis and the blocksize debate 
I am a long time Bitcoin user, miner, investor, full node operator, and
distributed real-time system software engineer.
Out of the all currently proposed blocksize increase solutions, I support
BIP101 (or something like it) and find the current blocksize debate very
frustrating, so I will try to systematically debunk some common arguments
against BIP101 below.
   1.
   We should not increase the blocksize because we'll just end up hitting
   the limit again at a future time.
   -
      If a reasonable blocksize increase like BIP101 that scales with
      technology is implemented, it's not a given that we will hit the
      limit (consistently full blocks over an extended period of time) again in
      the future. Stating that we will definitely hit the blocksize limit again
      in the future is pure speculation about future bitcoin transaction volume
      that can't possibly be known at this time, and is nothing but conjecture.
      If technology increases faster than bitcoin transaction volume, simply
      scaling the Bitcoin blocksize could keep up with future demand.
If Bitcoin
      is successful beyond our wildest dreams and future transaction volume
      outstrips future blockchain space, alternative solutions like
sidechains or
      the lightning network will have more time to be implemented.
   1.
   The full node count will go down if we increase the blocksize because it
   will be more costly to run a full node.
   -
      I'm not sure this is true. I currently run a full node on a higher
      end consumer PC with a higher end home network connection, but if the
      blocksize limit is not raised and transaction fees increase such
that it is
      no longer economical for me to access the bitcoin blockchain directly, I
      will no longer run a full node to support the network. Bitcoin
is no longer
      interesting to me if it gets to the point where the average user
is priced
      off the blockchain. Users that have direct access to the blockchain are
      more likely to run full nodes. If Bitcoin ever becomes purely a limited,
      small settlement network, I will no longer support it and move onto
      something else.
   1.
   The blocksize can only be increased if there is developer ?consensus?
   and the change is not ?controversial?.
   -
      Any blocksize increase will the deemed ?controversial? and lack
      ?consensus?, but doing nothing in the face of consistently full
blocks and
      rising transaction fees is also ?controversial? and will lack
      Inaction, maintaining the status quo, and blocking a blocksize
increase in
      the face of consistently full blocks and rising transaction fees
is just as
      controversial as increasing the blocksize.
   1.
   Don't increase the blocksize now with all the promising work going on
   with sidechains and the lightning network.
   -
      KISS (keep it simple, stupid). When dealing with a highly complex,
      mission critical system, there needs to be a very compelling reason to
      choose a much more complex solution over a simple solution like BIP101.
      Sidechains and the lightning network are much more complex than
BIP101 and
      introduce new points of failure. It's hard enough to get folks
to trust the
      Bitcoin network after 7 years, so it will likely take years until
      sidechains and the lightning network are proven enough to be trusted by
      users.
   1.
   Some miners will be at a disadvantage with larger blocks.
   -
      As folks have pointed out multiple times, network speed is just one
      of many variables that impact mining profitability. I don't believe for a
      second that every miner in China (57% of the network) would be negatively
      impacted by larger blocks because some of them either have decent network
      connections or connect to mining pools with decent network connections.
      Miners will be given ample notice of a blocksize increase before
it occurs,
      so they will have time to make plans to deal with larger blocks. More
      transactions per block should also increase miner profitability because
      more transactions equals more users equals more transaction fees!
In conclusion, I think the next year is a make or break year for Bitcoin
and hope the developers do everything they can to come up with a reasonable
long term growth plan to put Bitcoin in the best possible position to be

What are you so afraid of, Eric? If Mike's fork is successful, consensus is
reached around larger blocks. If it is rejected, the status quo will remain
for now. Network consensus, NOT CORE DEVELOPER CONSENSUS, is the only thing
that matters, and those that go against network consensus will be severely
punished with complete loss of income.
I'm not sure who appointed the core devs some sort of Bitcoin Gods that can
hold up any change that they happen to disagree with. It seems like the
core devs are scared to death that the bitcoin network may change without
their blessing, so they go on and on about how terrible hard forks are.
Hard forks are the only way to keep core devs in check.
Despite significant past technical bitcoin achievements, two of the most
vocal opponents to a reasonable blocksize increase work for a company
(Blockstream) that stands to profit directly from artificially limiting the
blocksize. The whole situation reeks. Because of such a blatant conflict of
interest, the ethical thing to do would be for them to either resign from
Blockstream or immediately withdraw themselves from the blocksize debate.
This is the type of stuff that I hoped would end with Bitcoin, but alas, I
guess human nature never changes.
Personally, I think miners should give Bitcoin XT a serious look. Miners
need to realize that they are in direct competition with the lightning
network and sidechains for fees. Miners, ask yourselves if you think you'll
earn more fees with 1 MB blocks and more off-chain transactions or with 8
MB blocks and more on-chain transactions...
The longer this debate drags on, the more I agree with BIP 100 and Jeff
Garzik because the core devs are already being influenced by outside forces
and should not have complete control of the blocksize. It's also
interesting to note that most of the mining hashpower is already voting for
8MB blocks BIP100 style.

I know full well who works for Blockstream and I know you're not one of
those folks. The Blockstream core devs are very vocal against a reasonable
blocksize increase (17% growth per year in Pieter's BIP is not what I
consider reasonable because it doesn't come close to keeping with
technological increases). I think we can both agree that more on-chain
space means less demand for lightning, and vice versa, which is a blatant
conflict of interest.
I'm also trying to figure out how things like lightning are not competing
directly with miners for fees. More off-chain transactions means less
blockchain demand, which would lower on-chain fees. I'm not sure what is
controversial about that statement.
The lightning network concept is actually a brilliant way to take fees away
from miners without having to make any investment in SSH-256 ASIC
mining hardware.

Being an early hub provider would be an obvious place to start capitalizing
on lightning. Early lightning adopters would be in the best position to do
Long term, Bitcoin needs to scale the blockchain in a reasonable manner and
implement things like lightning.
Limiting the blocksize is a blatant conflict of interest because it creates
artificial demand for lightning that would not otherwise exist if the
blockchain scaled in a reasonable manner.

Let's start with the definition of a conflict of interest before we go any
A *conflict of interest* (COI) is a situation in which a person or
organization is involved in multiple interests (financial, emotional, or
otherwise), one of which could possibly corrupt the motivation of the
individual or organization.
Just because a conflict of interest exists does not necessarily mean the
individual with a conflict of interest has engaged in any wrongdoing. They
could be a saint. However, to not even be able to acknowledge that such a
conflict of interest exists when debating such a serious issue as the
bitcoin blocksize is incredibly naive.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Bitcoin Core versus XT observations 
1.) Most people are running XT as a vote for bigger blocks and not because
they specifically support BIP101. If Core supported bigger blocks, most XT
users would switch back to Core and XT would die.
2.) In this high stakes game of poker, XT just went all in, but Core still
has the far better hand. There are many, many scaling solutions Core could
adopt that would appease XT users enough to kill XT. Don't let perfect be
the enemy of good. The real question is whether or not anyone can provide
enough Core leadership to reach "consensus". The longer it takes for Core
to reach "consensus", the stronger XT gets.
3.) Bitcoin market price has a far greater mining centralizing effect than
larger blocks ever will. Right now, miners with reasonably efficient
hardware and energy costs (.5W/GH mining hardware, 10 cents per kilowatt
hour power, $250 BTC price) spend about half of their mining income on
electricity. If the total Bitcoin market cap is under ~5 billion at the
next halving in July 2016, it's game over for all but the most efficient
(large) miners. The mining centralization that may occur with 8MB blocks in
2016 is nothing compared to the centralization that will occur if the total
Bitcoin market cap does not grow substantially between now and the next
4.) Investors hate uncertainty, and the blocksize issue is adding a lot of
uncertainty right now, which makes the mining nightmare scenario outlined
above more likely. The entire ecosystem needs time to adjust and grow once
a Core scaling solution is adopted. Hopefully this issue will be revolved
well before the next halving in July 2016 so the market has time to adjust
and grow again.
5.) Not-BitcoinXT is a really terrible idea. Mike has proven time and time
again that he will not blink or back down. The chances of Not-BitcoinXT
gaining 25% of the hashrate are pretty much nil, so in effect, all
Not-BitcoinXT will do is help XT reach the 75% threshold sooner and end up
putting more people on the losing side of the fork.
