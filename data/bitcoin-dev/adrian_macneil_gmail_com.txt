@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP numbers 
I'm not sure if anyone has suggested this in the past, but a novel approach
would be to simply let anyone open a pull request and use the PR # as the
BIP  This would avoid conflicts, and avoid the chore of having someone
manually assign them.
Downside would be that some numbers will never get used (for example if PRs
are opened to update existing BIPs), but this doesn't seem to be a huge
problem since already many numbers are going unused.
This process can still be independent from approving/merging the BIP into
master, if it meets quality standards.
