@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Solving the Scalability Problem on Bitcoin 
Solving the Scalability issue for bitcoin  I have this idea to solve the scalability problem I wish to make public.
If I am wrong I hope to be corrected, and if I am right we will all gain by
it. Currently each block is being hashed, and in its contents are the hash of
the block preceding it, this goes back to the genesis block.
What if we decide, for example, we decide to combine and prune the
blockchain in its entirety every 999 blocks to one block (Genesis block not
included in count).
How would this work?: Once block 1000 has been created, the network would
be waiting for a special "pruned block", and until this block was created
and verified, block 1001 would not be accepted by any nodes.
This pruned block would prune everything from block 2 to block 1000,
leaving only the genesis block. Blocks 2 through 1000, would be calculated,
to create a summed up transaction of all transactions which occurred in
these 999 blocks.
And its hash pointer would be the Genesis block.
This block would now be verified by the full nodes, which if accepted would
then be willing to accept a new block (block 1001, not including the pruned
block in the count).
The new block 1001, would use as its hash pointer the pruned block as its
reference. And the count would begin again to the next 1000. The next
pruned block would be created, its hash pointer will be referenced to the
Genesis Block. And so on..
In this way the ledger will always be a maximum of 1000 blocks.
 A bit more detail: All the outputs needed to verify early transactions will all be in the
pruning block. The only information you lose are of the intermediate
transactions, not the final ones the community has already accepted.
For example:
A = 2.3 BTC, B=0, C=1.4. (Block 1)
If A sends 2.3 BTC to B. (Block 2)
And then B sends 1.5 to C. (Block 3)
The pruning block will report:
B = 0.8 and C=2.9. The rest of the information you lose, is irrelevant. No one needs to know
that A even existed since it is now empty, nor do they need to know how
much B and C had previously, only what they have now.
Note: The Transaction Chain would also need to be rewritten, to delete all
intermediate transactions, it will show as though transactions occurred
from the Genesis block directly to the pruned block, as though nothing ever
existed in between.
You can keep the old blocks on your drive for 10 more blocks or so, just in
case a longer block chain is found, but other than that the information it
holds is useless, since it has all been agreed upon. And the pruning block
holds all up to date account balances, so cheating is impossible.
Granted this pruning block can get extremely large in the future, it will
not be the regular size of the other blocks. For example if every account
has only 1 satoshi in it, which is the minimum, then the amount of accounts
will be at its maximum. Considering a transaction is about 256bytes. That
would mean the pruning block would be approximately 500PB, which is 500,000
Terra-bytes. That is a theoretical scenario, which is not likely to occur.
(256bytes*23M BTC*100M (satoshis in 1 BTC))
A scenario which could be solved by creating a minimum transaction fee of
100 satoshis, which would insure that even in the most unlikely scenario,
at worst the pruning block would be 5PB in size.
Also, this pruning block does not even need to be downloaded, it could be
created by already existing information, each full node by itself, by 1) combining and pruning all previous blocks 2) using the genesis block as its hash pointer 3) using a predefined random number "2", which will be used by all. A
random number which is normally added to a block to ensure the block's
hashrate difficulty, is not needed in this case, since all information can
be verified by each node by itself through pruning. 4) Any other information which is needed for the SHA256 hash, for example a
timestamp could be copied off the last block in the block chain. These steps will ensure each full node, will get the exact hash code as the
others have gotten for this pruning block.
And as I previously stated the next block will use this hash code as its
hash reference.
By creating a system like this, the pruning block does not have to be
created last minute, but gradually over time, every time a new block comes
in, and only when the last block arrives (block 1000), will it be
finalized, and hashed.
And since this block will always be second, it should go by the name
"Exodus Block".

Solving the Scalability Problem Part II
The problem with changing the transaction and block chain, is that it
cannot be done without knowing the private key of the sender of the of the
funds for each account. There is however a way to circumvent that problem.
That is to create a special account called the ?Genesis Account?, this
account?s Private Key and Public Key will be available to everyone.
But this account will not be able to send or receive any funds in a normal
block, it will be blocked--blacklisted. So no one can intentionally use it.
The only time this account will be used is in the pruning block, a.k.a
Exodus Block.
When creating the new pruned block chain and transaction chain, all the
funds that are now in accounts must be legitimate, and it would be
difficult to legitimize them unless they were sent from a legitimate
account, with a public key, and a private key which can be verified. That
is where the Genesis account comes in. All funds in the Exodus Block will
show as though they originated and were sent from the Genesis Account using
its privatekey to generate each transaction.
The funds which are sent, must match exactly the funds existing in the most
updated ledger in block 1000 (the last block as stated in my previous
In this way the Exodus Block can be verified, and the Genesis Account
cannot give free money to anyway, because if someone tried to, it would
fail verification.
Now the next problem is that the number of Bitcoins keeps expanding and so
the funds in the Genesis Account need to expand as well. That can be done
by showing as though this account is the account which is mining the coins,
and it will be the only account in the Exodus Block which ?mines? the
coins, and receives the mining bonus. In the Exodus Block all coins mined
by the real miners will show as though they were mined by Genesis and sent
to the miners through a regular transaction.

Thank You Christian for your response.
 :  I dont see the relevance.
 : This idea does not seem
to talking about trimming the full node. Trimming the full node is the key,
the full node is what keeps us secure from hackers. If it can be trimmed
without losing security, that would be good, that is what I am proposing.
 : Same answer as 505.0.
 : I think his proposal is
similar to mine, unfortunately for us his predictions were way off. He was
trying to fix this problem while believing that in the year 2020 the
blockchain would be 4GB!!! It is not his fault, his prediction was in 2011.
But you can see, by his prediction, which was rational at the time, was way
off. And it stresses my point, we need to fix this now. Too bad, no one
took him seriously back then, when the block chain i was 1GB.
*: Another guy with a
valid point, who was first acknowledged and then apparently ignored.
To summarize, this problem was brought up about 6 years ago, when the
blockchain was 1GB in size, Now it is about 140GB in size. I think it is
about time we stop ignoring this problem, and realize something needs to
change, or else the only full-nodes you will have will be with private
multi-million dollar companies, because no private citizen will have the
storage space to keep it. That would make bitcoin the worst decentralized
or uncentralized system in history.

Thank you Thomas for your response.
1) Implement solution is impossible... I have given a solution in part II.
By adding a Genesis Account which will be the new sender.
2)Keeping older blocks: Yes as I said 10 older blocks should be kept, that
should suffice. I am not locked on that number, if you think there is a
reason to keep more than that, it is open to debate.
3) Why 1000? To be honest, that number came off the top of my head. These
are minor details, the concept must first be accepted, then we can work on
the minor details.
4)Finally it's not just the addresses and balance you need to save...  I
think the Idea of the Genesis Account, solves this issue.
5) The problem with node pruning is that it is not standardized, and for a
new node to enter the network and to verify the data, it needs to download
all data and prune it by itself. This will drastically lower the
information needed by the full nodes by getting rid of the junk.  Currently
we are around 140GB, that number is getting bigger exponentially, by the
number of users and transactions created. It could reach a Terrabyte sooner
than expected, we need to act now.
On your second email:
When I say account: I mean private-public key.
The way bitcoin works, as I understand it, is that the funds are verified
by showing that they have an origin, this "origin" needs to provide a
signature, otherwise the transaction won't be accepted.
If I am proposing to remove all intermediate origins, then the funds become
untraceable and hence unverifiable. To fix that, a new transaction needs to
replace old ones. A simplified version: If there was a transaction chain
A->B->C->D, and I wish to show only A->D, only a transaction like that
never actually occurred, it would be impossible to say that it did without
having A's private key, in order to sign this transaction. In order to
create this transaction, I need A's private key. And if I wish this to be
publicly implemented I need this key to be public, so that any node
creating this Exodus Block can sign with it. Hence the Genesis Account. And
yes, it is not really an account.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Revised - Solving the Scalability Problem on Bitcoin 
This is a link to the most updated version of the problem and my proposed
solution, granted it still needs work, but this problem needs to be
resolved quickly. So I hope it will receive the attention it deserves, even
if the solution comes from somebody else.
The latest version of the day:
*Solving the Scalability issue for Bitcoin  *
*What am I trying to solve?* Currently Bitcoin?s blockchain is around 140GB.
In 2011 it took 1GB, and it was predicted back then that in 2020 that size
would be 4GB.
As you can see it is not yet 2020, and we are way over that predicted size.
At our current time, prune nodes which make the block smaller, but they can
not be validated without the full node. And this full node is getting
exponentially bigger, we need to stop that. Because if we don?t no private
citizen will have the capability of storing the full node in his computer,
and all full nodes will be at private multi-million dollar companies. That
would literally be the end of decentralization (or non-centralization).
What I am proposing also makes sure the blockchain has a maximum finite
size, because today the blockchain can grow to any size without limit while
it approaches an infinite size!
Today our blockchain is growing at speed which is much faster than Moore?s
law! This proposal will help set storage growth at a reasonable number.
*A short list of what I am about to explain:   Steps that need to be taken:*
