I see that the latest nightly build (thanks for that, Warren) is still not compatible with Tails/Debian Squeeze. Is there still an intention to address this issue? Might it be fixed by 0.9.2?

Bitcoin-Qt 0.8.6 worked fine on Tails (and Debian Squeeze, I assume). So, it is a regression.
Here's output from the latest nightly build for Linux:
amnesia at amnesia:~/bitcoin-0.9.99.0-20140422-2bbecc8-linux/bin/32$ ./bitcoin-qt
./bitcoin-qt: symbol lookup error: ./bitcoin-qt: undefined symbol: _ZN19QAbstractProxyModel11setItemDataERK11QModelIndexRK4QMapIi8QVariantE
Since Tails has many simple development tools like "make" stripped out for security reasons, one could not simply build from source in Tails. It might be possible to build in Debian Squeeze and transplant that, however. I'll have to give that a shot some time. I'd argue that Tails is an incredibly important -- and hardly obscure -- Linux distribution that Bitcoin should endeavour to support. See:
