I?m afraid this is a highly simplistic view of the costs of running a full node.
My node consumes fantastic amounts of data traffic, which is a real cost.
In the 30 days ending Apri 6, my node:
* Received 36.8 gb of data
* Sent 456.5 gb data
At my geographic service location (Singapore), this cost about $90 last month for bandwidth alone. It would be slightly cheaper if I was hosted in the US of course.
But anyone can understand that moving a half-terrabyte of data around in a month will not be cheap.

It may not be our place to say whether XP is secure or not, but if we say that we support it then we have to run test passes against XP as a platform, and if an XP user reports a bug, then we have to do something to address it.  So, it becomes a test and support issue, not a security issue.
That?s why it doesn?t make sense to support an OS platform that the original vendor (MS) no longer supports themselves.

You?re right.  That?s a huge oversight.  I think any software product you?ve ever considered installing has a section that says
?Hey, we want this much ram on your system, this much disk space, this processor, etc?.
Otherwise, you?re just setting yourself up for a bad user experience from people with marginal machines.
