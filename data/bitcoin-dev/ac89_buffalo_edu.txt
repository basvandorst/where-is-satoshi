@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] BetterHash status 
What is the status of Matt Corallo's "BetterHash" BIP??   I recommend it
goes into production sooner than later.  Any 2nd's ?
Thanks in advance!

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Ring VS Schnorr signatures 
============================== START ==============================
In the world of architectural trade-offs, specifically: confidentiality versus base layer performance, and
in the current regulatory environment, as global monetary affairs begin to get "more real," I'm now leaning towards greater confidentiality rather than my earlier preference for performance.
Do Ring sigs with Stealth addresses impede blockchain performance or do they mis-align with Bitcoin's longer term
dev roadmap?
