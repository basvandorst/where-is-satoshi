@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] how to disable segwit in my build? 
On 13 July 2017 at 03:04, Gregory Maxwell via bitcoin-dev <
I believe that a good reason not to wish your node to be segwit compliant
is to avoid having to deal with the extra bandwidth that segwit could
require.   Running a 0.14.2 node means being ok with >1MB blocks, in case
segwit is activated and widely used. Users not interested in segwit
transactions may prefer to keep the cost of their node lower.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] [BIP Proposal] Standard address format for 
Hi ZmnSCPxj,
Few thoughts about your proposal:
1- I kinda like the idea and I would probably use it, but still I believe
it is a very limited use case and probably most wallet providers will not
be interested in supporting it.
2- Early adopters and people highly involved in the community may
appreciate the "hodl" part in the redemption code, but it could cause
confusion in normal users not understanding the reference.
Regarding the time-zone I think the best option is to stick the UTC
standard, using UTC+14 could be confusing since it is very unusual  and we
are not used to deal with it.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP Idea: Marginal Pricing 
The main issue that I see with this proposal is that miners can still spam
the network for free even with high sat/byte fee levels. They can first
choose the sat/byte rate that maximize their profit, and then include a lot
of spam transactions at that rate that will only pay fees to themselves,
effectively spamming the chain for free and increasing the cost of running
a node.

Something similar to this has been proposed  in this article by Ron Lavi,
Or Sattath, and Aviv Zohar, and discussed in this bitcoin-dev thread
They only discussed changing the fee structure, not removing the block size
limit, as far as I know.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] URI scheme with optional bech32 address 
Hello everyone,
With my team we are working on a walleting application which ideally will
generate a bech32 address when receiving from a bech32 compatible wallet,
and a P2WPKH-nested-in-P2SH address when receiving for a legacy wallet.
However, it is of course impossible for the payee to know in advance the
technological capabilities of the payer, so a solution could be to encode
in a Bitcoin URI both bech32 and P2SH addresses in a way that legacy
wallets only see the P2SH address, while new wallets can also see the
bech32 address and use it to perform the transaction.
In particular, to keep compatibility with BIP21, the  field of the
URI can be used for the P2WPKH-nested-in-P2SH address and a new field (e.g.
 or ), which will be ignored by legacy
wallets, can be used to encode the bech32 address. The assumption here is
that the wallets using such scheme will monitor incoming transaction both
on the P2SH address and on the bech32 address.
I did some research around and I did not find any proposal addressing the
same issue, so my questions are (i) does anybody already proposed something
going in the same direction and (ii) do you see any major drawback in the
BIP21 compatible scheme proposed in this message?
Thanks in advance,

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP - Symbol for satoshi 
I don't believe the will of Satoshi is particularly relevant on this
matter. Having a term everybody can converge on to express small amounts is
very important to improve the user experience, and satoshis seem to have
more chances to achieve this than scientific notations.
My main concern with satoshis as a unit is that it may sound weird/funny to
native Japanese speakers. It could probably be useful to have the opinion
of some of them on this topic.
Regarding the BIP to formalise the symbol for satoshi, I think that maybe
is better to wait for something to emerge with more widespread usage (e.g.
already used by some wallets or service providers). The linked proposal
does not seem to have sufficient support to be proposed as a standard.
