I can't truly express in this email exactly how much I personally disagree
with that statement/belief because I don't think the dev mailing list is
the appropriate forum for such philosophical discussions.
I will say this, though: I think you've missed much of the point of Bitcoin

Unless you're relying upon some hypothetical hyper-inflation of the USD,
how does one accept or justify such fees given the title (and intentions)
of Satoshi's own white paper and corresponding software?
I believe the key words "cash system" must be kept in mind throughout all
of these discussions and developments, or else we risk turning Bitcoin into
something other than cash.
Bitcoin will no longer be a P2P cash system if the fees make transactions
prohibitively expensive for all but the wealthiest of individuals and
I understand that a careful balance must be struck between (measurable?)
decentralization and Bitcoin's use as an actual cash system; however, those
who are willing to annihilate the latter to maintain ONLY the former must
at least be honest with everyone that they really don't care if Bitcoin
becomes something entirely different than Satoshi's original invention and
Call it a necessary transformation or reinvention, and by a new name, if
you will; because, with exorbitant fees, it may no longer be accurate or
appropriate to call it Bitcoin: A Peer-to-peer Electronic CASH System.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP 100 specification 
I agree with Simon's sentiments for question  and was actually going to
pose the same question. Non-votes seem like they may poison the well
mathematically, and counting them anyway seems to encourage a lack of
participation at a time when miners really need to be very much involved.
Since we're handing them even more control over the ecosystem with this
BIP, it would be nice to ensure they (all miners) seriously consider their
impact and role on a regular basis.
I'm curious why we couldn't/shouldn't simply drop the non-votes. (There may
be a great reason that I can't think of, but it's eluding me... LOL)
That said, I don't see any issue with counting votes from outside of the
range as the maximum/minimum accordingly (Simon's question  In fact,
such votes would be very interesting (worthy of further discussion) if they
begin to lean heavily in either direction.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Base Size Increase and Segregated Witness with 
Evening all,
The following BIP submission summarizes an idea that I've been tossing
around for the last year.  I understand that there may be nuances to SegWit
and current consensus layer mechanisms that I may not fully understand, so
please do not hesitate to shred the following text to pieces (I can handle
it, I promise!).
Please note that this BIP assumes failure of the current softfork version
of SegWit to activate in November -- something that I personally do not
wish to see(!). However, given the real possibility of that happening, or
perhaps just some newfound willingness (by "the community") to support a
hardfork in lieu of a stalemate, I figure now is as good a time as any to
share the idea in black and white.
I would really appreciate any/all feedback from the dev community on the
technical merits (read: feasibility) of the idea. I would especially
appreciate feedback from the SegWit developers who designed the current
implementation in 0.14, as they likely have the most intimate knowledge of
SegWit's nuances, and the entire BIP below would likely rely on their
willingness to develop a hardfork version.
Nothing in this BIP is set in stone -- including all values and timelines

Peter -
Do we know that for a fact, though? What evidence or intelligence do we
have to indicate Bitmain itself is the only entity using the covert boost?
A few possibilities:
1. They could have already shared it with a limited number of strategic
2. They could have offered to share it with various parties in exchange for
something (money, support for BU, etc); or
3. They could provide the custom firmware/software to select parties as a
direct response to this disclosure -- which would enhance their defenses
against a soft fork.
4. They could share the firmware/software with EVERY owner of their
equipment in a last-ditch defense against a soft fork. (after all, some
advantage over other equipment manufacturers is still better than no
advantage, right?)
Assumptions could lead to failure, so these are just some things to keep in

years....gradually, no massive fee swings.<<<
How is that captured in the COOP BIP? I can see Luke's 2MB cap referenced
in the BIP, but I don't see anything in the text that would indicate a
gradual increase of any sort.
As someone who has previously written a BIP draft to accomplish a gradual
increase with SegWit, I'd be very interested in seeing what approach
they've chosen.

in December with 8MB<<
I'm not sure how many people to not of the draft BIP I submitted to the
list in early April. It was essentially a combination of Gavin's BIP 109,
Adam's 2-4-8 idea, and something I added to SegWit that I call "Discount
It basically takes the idea of gradual increases one step farther: a
gradual increase of both the Total weight and SegWit discount rate over a
period of X years (a schedule of Flag Day + X blocks increases).
Would this be something that some in the dev community might consider
if/when SegWit is combined with a block increase?

size hardfork, this is probably the best way to do it right now... Legacy
Bitcoin transactions are given the witness discount, and a block size limit
of 2 MB is imposed.<<
The above decision may quickly become very controversial. I don't think it's
what most users had/have in mind when they discuss a "2MB+SegWit" solution.
With the current 1MB+SegWit, testing has shown us that normal usage results
in ~2 or 2.1MB blocks.
I think most users will expect a linear increase when Base Size is
increased to 2000000 bytes and Total Weight is increased to 8000000 bytes.
With normal usage, the expected results would then be ~4 or 4.2MB blocks.
Am I missing something here, or does Luke's suggested 2MB cap completely
nullify that expected linear increase? If so, why? What's the logic behind
this decision?
I'd love to be armed with a good answer should my colleagues ask me the
same obvious question, so thank you ahead of time!
