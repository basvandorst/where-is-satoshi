@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP Number Request: Addresses over Audio 
This is my BIP idea: a fast, robust, and standardized for representing
Bitcoin addresses over audio. It takes the binary representation of the
Bitcoin address (little endian), chops that up into 4 or 2 bit chunks
(depending on type, 2 bit only for low quality audio like american
telephone lines), and generates a tone based upon that value. This started
because I wanted an easy way to donate to podcasts that I listen to, and
having a Shazam-esque app (or a media player with this capability) that
gives me an address automatically would be wonderful for both the consumer
and producer. Comes with error correction built into the protocol

Sorry about the last email, I deleted the repository to get rid of the BIP
number to prevent confusion. The correct address is

I wouldn't worry about payment requests until I built a decoder and made
the transmission a lot faster (probably adding tones and making it 5 bits
wide), which shouldn't be hard

It wouldn't be feasible in the vast majority of cases, but I can't think of
a reason why it can't be built into the standard.

I have updated the GitHub a lot (changed tones to be less chirpy, fixed
some smalls) and made a couple of samples (see attachment for MP3 and FLAC
of both tone tables, first 16 then 4). Is this good enough to warrant an
official BIP number? I haven't built a decoder yet, but it seems like the
encoder is working properly (looked at Audacity, seems like it is working),
and some people on reddit want to "allow for decoding experiments"
What suggestions do you all have for it?

In all honesty, I shouldn't have added the multiple feature. It should
always stay to one and have the Bitcoin address's built in checksum do all
of the heavy lifting (or implement another checksum into the protocol).
Having said that, it would make the most sense to not include BIP21
requests. The frequencies that are going to be used are prone to being
changed (probably moving them into the ultrasound range, at least for the
16 tones)

I thought it was only 12, will change it accordingly.
I looked at Audio Modem and will probably look at the others soon as well.
The general idea of this BIP is to see if you all even approve of the idea
of sending Bitcoin addresses over sound waves. I will push it into the
ultrasound, and I might implement phase modulation.

What would be the advantages of transmitting a BIP32 public seed, instead
of a plain address?
I didn't really think of that, but that's genius.

thats how i thought it worked originally, but im not well versed on that,
so i took his word for it

I started work on the decoder. It works by comparing each cycle of the sine
wave recorded with a certain frequency (freq_t). The function that does
this currently returns the last sample that falls in that range over all
samples. The longest chain to match up with a certain frequency the best is
interpreted as that frequency (assuming it passes an entrance floor to
separate it from static).  I will probably extrapolate the sine wave to
more samples (320 kbps+), but this works OK just for testing. I am also
prepping the docs per the official BIP spec.
GitHub is Is it okay to host the BIP on my own GitHub, or do I need to host it on a
more official repository?
