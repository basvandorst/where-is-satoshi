@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Mempool size consensus + dynamic block size 
To my knowledge so far the main proposals regarding block size changes are either based on predictions, which traditionally we're not very good at, or a voting mechanism by a limited set of stakeholders (miners) whose interests may not be aligned with the rest of the community.
Neither strategy takes into account the most important factor: real-time changes to the mempool. This is for a valid reason, there is currently no consensus on the size of the mempool.
So my question is: has anyone considered the pros and cons of creating consensus around the current (approximate) mempool size?
I propose that, at the expense of some transaction overhead (3 or 4 extra bytes?), each full-node that broadcasts a new transaction can add a mempool_size field that represents their current view of the mempool. As blocks are mined with this new data (which may or not be aggregated in the block header), all nodes can quickly reach consensus on the current average/median/etc mempool size, and agree on a suitable periodic blocksize "re-targetting" (similarly to mining difficulty).
Since all full-nodes (not just miners) get to vote with their transactions the consensus is truly global, and we don't have to change blocksize blindly in anticipation of an unpredictable future.
Would this not work, and if not, why?

What would be the incentive for the majority of transaction broadcasting full-nodes to lie about the mempool size?

I shouldn't have to answer that, but the answer is clearly no.
Please consider this argument when evaluating the pros and cons of BIP 100.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] The need for larger blocks 
This is especially important if take into account all the projects that aim to build upon the bitcoin blockchain and that can have a significant impact, both in terms of storage space as well as transaction volume spikes.
Just recently I suggested the need for a BIP to standardize reporting of "delay alerts" in wallets, so that users can act accordingly (i.e. fee-bump, postpone, cancel) before sending their transactions during these periods of increased transaction volume.
IMHO keeping the users informed of potential issues before committing transactions to the network can go a long way towards preventing frustration and potential backlashes against blockchain tech.
