@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] License for BIP39 word lists 
I would like to use the BIP39 word lists posted in the Github BIP repo
for my own project.
Unfortunately there is no license associated with the lists provided on
Github so I am not sure whether usage for other projects is permitted. I
am not able to file issues on the repo either to suggest adding a license.
Does anybody know under which license these lists are published?
Best regards,
