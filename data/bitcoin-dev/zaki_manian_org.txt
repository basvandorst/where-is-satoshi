@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Building Blocks of the State Machine Approach to 
Hi Peter,
I didn't entirely understand the process of transaction linearization.
What I see is a potential process where when the miner assembles the block,
he strips all but one sigscript per tx. The selection of which  sigscript
is retained is determined by the random oracle.  Is this is primary benefit
you are suggesting?
It appears to me that blocks still need to contain a list of full TX Input
and Tx Outputs with your approach. Some of the description seems to
indicate that there are opportunities to elide further data but it's
unclear to me how.
