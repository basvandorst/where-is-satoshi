As noted elsewhere in the thread, there are two problems with this
1. It asserts that zero-confirmation transactions are in a binary
state of safe/broken instead of recognizing that relying on them is a
non-binary risk analysis on the part of a merchant.
2. Assumptions about what is profitable for miners are based on all
miners having short time horizons for calculating profits.
In addition, I'll add that there is an assumption that honest actors
can not alter their behavior in response to changing conditions.
Since scorched-earth solutions to problems are apparently acceptable
now, what would stop more honest node operators from patching their
nodes to blacklist any peer that relays replace-by-fee transactions,
and maybe even publish an IP address list of those peers?
Punishing Bitcoin users for not adopting somebody's pet solution to a
problem neither responsible nor ethical.
Child-pays-for-parent allows for stuck transactions to be cleared from
the mempool, and allows recipients of zero-conf transactions to adjust
their risk exposure as much or as little as they like.
It's a solution that gives Bitcoin users more freedom, instead of
trying to coerce them into pre-determined directions.

Force is not a helpful or accurate way to describe the situation.
The purpose of Bitcoin to let people trade with each other, and trade requires mutual agreement.
If some people choose not to trade under certain terms, they aren't "forcing" anybody to do anything. They are simply refraining from proposed interactions. Not granting them the right to do this would actually be forcing them to engage in interactions against their will.
It's an unavoidable reality that Bitcoin's usefulness is related to the size (really: economic output) of the group of people who can be convinced that it's in their best interest to agree on a common trade Conversations that feature untrue claims about someone forcing someone else to do something is the opposite of a viable strategy for growing the size of that group.
Arguments about who violated what Bitcoin Core internal governance procedures are not interesting to most Bitcoin users, who generally don't know or care who has commit access to the repository.
Getting angry at Gavin and Mike for providing Bitcoin users with an alternative which they can freely choose or reject is not helpful in persuading users to stay with Bitcoin Core. Making the case why the changes in Bitcoin XT are not beneficial to Bitcoin users could be.
For better or for worse, Bitcoin coin users are going to run the software they perceive to be in their best interests.  Nobody can stop them from making that choice and any effort directed at that end is It's more productive to expend effort making sure the current and future Bitcoin users are as informed as possible about the long term and short term consequences of their choices.
Circling back to the original quote:
Bitcoin does not and can not function as a set of rules imposed by some people onto other people. Bitcoin is a negotiation about the best way for money to function in the future. The only way we get people to use Bitcoin is to convince them that the benefits they gain from agreeing to its protocol outweigh the downsides they encounter.
I'm confident that this case can be made successfully but a prerequisite to a successful negotiation is recognizing that it is, in fact, a negotiation, and that the other parties have full agency and the right to walk away if mutual agreement is not reached.
My suggestion is to spend less time talking about procedural violations and more time convincing Bitcoin users that Bitcoin Core is the best client for them to use, especially if the process of convincing them involves making improvements which the users are asking for (or making a very compelling case about why the users should reconsider).

If there are two transactions which spend the same inputs, and each transaction has completely different output scripts, then this is prima facie fraudulent. If the two transactions have identical output scripts, and one output is reduced in value to increase the transaction fee, that has the appearance of honest dealing. There is a possibility that the payer has chose to under-pay their payee in order to over-pay the miner, but that's not what a reasonable observer would assume at first glance.
Adding outputs to a transaction, while keeping all the existing outputs exactly how they are is another way of increasing the transaction fee of a transaction and is prima facie non-fraudulent.
Note that child-pays-for-parent has none of this ambiguity.
I haven't closely looked into the features of Bitcoin XT because I'm hoping that it never becomes relevant. I do want to see a heterogenous implementation network develop, but Bitcoin XT doesn't really count since it's a derivative of the Bitcoin Core codebase.

I'm not talking about changing the protocol - I'm talking about the business relationships between users of Bitcoin.
I would expect a payment processor to inform the merchants of relevant double spends that it observes on the network, even if the payment is actually successful, so that the merchant can decide for themselves whether or not to pursue it out of band.
Mining is a kind of technical fallback that allows the network to resolve human misbehavior without human intervention. If nobody ever attempted to make a fraudulent payment, we wouldn't need mining at all because the signed transaction itself is proof of intention to pay. That it exists doesn't suddenly make fraud less fraudulent and mean that users who are in a position to pursue out of band recourse shouldn't do I agree that there are valid reasons for replacing transactions in the mempool, I just think they should be implemented in a way that doesn't facilitate fraud.

Again, I'm not talking about any changes to the protocol. The mining mechanism in the Bitcoin protocol is the fallback method of resolving fraud that isn't prevented or resolved via other mechanisms.
There are plenty of other ways economic actors resolve their disagreements other than blockchain adjudication. Sometimes when both parties are identified and reside in the same legal jurisdiction, contract violations and fraud can be adjudicated in courts. In some situations, the parties involved may have access to private dispute resolution techniques.
Sometimes the stakeholders in the network act to preserve the long term value of their investments, even if it means passing short-term profits. The more of those stakeholders there are in Bitcoin, the more effective it is to make the case for choices that are long-term beneficial.
The degree to which anyone should rely on a signed transaction as assurance of future payment is not a question with a universal answer. It depends on the particular details of the situation, and the parties involved, and their own risk tolerances and time preferences. There's no right answer for everyone, which is why "let's break zeroconf because *I* don't think it's safe enough" is a kind of vandalism.

Bitcoin has no concept of identity, but in any type of commercial transaction the parties involved must know some minimal amount of identity information in order to transact at all.
Except for some identifiable special cases, I think a payee is perfectly justified in treating a double spend of a payment sent to them as part of a commercial transaction as a fraud attempt and employing whatever non-Bitcoin recourse mechanisms, if any, they have access to.
- From the perspective of the network, the obviously correct action for any node or miner is to relay the first version of any transaction they see. The primary purpose of mining is to resolve this otherwise-unresolvable problem of determining which transaction among a set of conflicting transactions happened first.
If a node or miner wants to deviate from the obviously correct behaviour, and if they want to avoid harming the value of the network, they should be particularly careful to make sure their deviation from "first seen" doesn't introduce harmful unintended side effects, like making fraud easier.

At the moment none of the following assertions have been proven true,
yet are constantly cited as if they have been:
* A competitive fee market will develop when the transaction rate
becomes constrained by the block size limit
* More users of Bitcoin means less decentralization
Furthermore, the term "decentralization" is frequently used without
being precisely defined in a way that would allow for such proofs to
be debated.
If there's going to be a debate on those points, then the people
presenting points on both sides should take the time to show their
work and explain the methodology they used to reach their conclusions.

Again, this assertion requires proof.
Simply saying things is not the same as them being true.

How many individuals and companies do you propose will ever use
Bitcoin (order of magnitude estimates are fine)
Whatever number you select above, please describe approximately how
many lifetime Bitcoin transactions each individual and company will be
capable of performing with a 1 MB block size limit.
