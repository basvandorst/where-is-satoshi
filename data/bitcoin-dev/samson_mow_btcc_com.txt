Gavin, please don't quote that list on the Classic website. It's horribly
inaccurate and misleading to the general public.
I know for a fact that most companies you list there have no intention to
run Classic, much less test it. You should not mix support for 2MB with
support for Classic, or if people say they welcome a fork, to mean they
support Classic.
