@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Academic research regarding BIP0002 
Hi all,
I am doing a project trying to map out BIP002 ( into a bussiness process model using BPMN2.0.
This is a project regarding an academic research for my studies.
I am by no means an expert in Blockchain nor Bitcoin and have just recently began looking into the technologies.
Is someone willing to review or discuss my model?
If this is not the right place to discuss such a topic, pointing in the right direction is much appreciated.
Kind regards,
Shiva Jairam

Thanks for the tip nopara73.
I did not want to overwhelm the thread with unnecessary information, but then again it is hard to get feedback with no viewable information.
Here is the link to the concept model I have so far.

Just a tip: if you'd like to get feedback on your work, then share your work as well, since not many people are willing to commit to helping unless they know how large the work is.
