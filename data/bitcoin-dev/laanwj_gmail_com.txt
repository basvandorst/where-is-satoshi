I still feel like this is sign message stuff is dragging the kitchen sink
into Bitcoin. It's fine for logging into a website, what you use it for,

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Signature Blocks and URI Sign Requests 
That is a laudable goal.
So your proposal is about signing "Preformatted messages from sites" to
make financial transactions more secure, not arbitrary user-to-user
messages such as email. That really restricts the scope, which is good.
In this case there is no use for S/MIME, which deals with encoding/signing
multipart mail messages. And no need to deal with MIME headers, html, or
embedded images, and such. And we can simply require one character
encoding, no need to support hundreds.
The "request signing" bitcoin URL makes sense in my eyes. Less copy/pasting
is good. Do mind that there is usually a URL size limit (depending on the
browser) so this cannot be used for long messages/contracts. A possible
solution would be to make an option to pass the address where the message
can be retrieved (and maybe also where the signature must be sent, to save
a copy-paste back?).
Looking at existing solutions, the only other "sign request" that I know of
is the CSR ( but
the functionality and goal is very different.
It'd be useful (and IMO most important) to write down some use-cases in
which this makes P2SH easier and less involved. How many steps can be
eliminated of the 14?

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Adding request/reply id in messages 
I also wondered this. My first thought was that it's basically the same as
the PING message, a nonce that is repeated immediately on reply. This makes
it easier to multiplex operations over a single channel. I'm not against
this basic idea, and it is easy to ignore for clients that don't want to
use it.
I think the state comes in here:
      - inv sends back the requestid given in getblocks or a special value
in case of a notification.
      - addr sends back the requestid given in getaddr or a special value
in case of a notification.
"*command1* sends back the requestid given in *command2*".
This requires keeping state on the connection between command1 and
command2. Arguably, this state already exists in the current protocol, but
I'd rather see it reduced than extended.
Also... Many of the described commands don't need this as they already have
a natural "nonce". For example, the id of the requested block header. If
this is passed in the reply, and the caller can correlate the request and
reply without a special nonce administration.

For 0.7 we've added a red "(out of sync)" warning to the balances when the

However, due to the design of the protocol there is a large variance in

There were a lot of subtle changes to the English base messages such as
capitalization or punctuation, I know this is pretty annoying for
translators. It is a pity that there is no way to update all translations
when the English base message changes but not significantly enough to
trigger re-translation. I've looked but Transifex does not have that option.
Also there were new duplicated strings:
Duplicate strings are not a problem. Some strings are used multiple times
in the program, and thus appear multiple times in the translation. This is
because there are cases in which a string that is the same in English is
translated differently in another language based on the context.
At least Qt translator fills duplicates in automatically, with the option
to change them if desired. I'm not sure about Transifex but I've heard it's
the same there.
The default depends on compiler flags, hence the two messages. I suppose
the message could be split up, so that "Use UPnP to map the listening port"
is factored out.
Let's do this after 0.7.0 release though, otherwise all the translations
for those messages will be broken again. There should be no more message
changes before the release unless there is a very good reason.

I do think it would be nice to sweep up dust transactions, however I'm not
that happy with your solution
1) Wouldn't the need to re-transact your coins to keep them safe from
"vultures", result in people frantically sending coins to themselves, and
thus expand the block chain, instead of reduce growth?
2) putting those hard limits in passes a value judgement that IMO should
not be present in the protocol. <1BTC may be worth a lot some day, or it
could go the other way around, with dust spam of 10+ BTC. Either way the
limits will have to be changed again, with yet another fork.
3) The (normal) user does not have a view of his balance consisting of
inputs and outputs of various sizes. He just sees his balance as one
number. And somehow, inexplicably (except through a very difficult
explanation), it's going down... what if he has 10000 BTC in 0.9999999 BTC
units? Annnnnd it's gone after 210000 blocks.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Roadmap to getting users onto SPV clients 
Most of those issues don't have to do with the SPV versus non-SPV problem.
First person doesn't understand what Bitcoin is supposed to do (he's
confusing mining and running a node). An information problem that could be
solved by explaining what is going on.
Another one seems to have a problem with DEP. That's probably an issue with
his OS configuration.
The third one is confused about the fees. Again, an information problem.
Only the fourth one is concerned with synchronization. The other ones could
happen with any client, as they're either based on misconceptions about
bitcoin as a whole or computer problems.
This doesn't in any way make switching to another, reduced security model
client preferable. Let's first try to improve the Bitcoin experience with
full security model, and if that somehow turns out to be impossible it's
always possible to recommend some other client based on the 'user type'.
I don't agree that this point is now. Anyway, security and stability of the
network is of utmost importance to do anything in the future, better to
grow organically than explode.
Many initiatives are underway to improve the Satoshi client (for example to
have Bitcoin-Qt behave as SPV client during initial block download, and as
full node after that), but as usual in open source development, many of us
are doing this basically for fun in our free time it does not always go as
fast as users would like.
I wish there was a straightforward solution for that, yeah pooling together
our development on one or two clients instead of a zillion different ones
could help, but everyone has more fun working on their own client that's
just how things go :)

I also wonder whether the "send to private address" should be part of this

IMO (but your mileage may vary) this BIP should only define the bare-bones
URL scheme, AND provide room for future extensions such
as send-to-private-address, send-multiple-signers, and so on. These should
be forwards-compatible (as Luke-Jr says) in the sense that older clients
can detect schemes they don't understand and give the user an appropriate
error message.
Maybe we need a send-type parameter to define the scheme?
Good point on the version parameter. How are clients supposed to handle
this? Refuse to handle the request if their URL scheme parser version is
older than in the URL? This should be in the BIP.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] BIP 21 (modification BIP 20) 
To ensure forward compatibility with optional fields, we need to define how
a client handles fields that it doesn't know about.
When should it display an error message, and when should it silently accept
and ignore the extraneous fields?
(For example, if something that restricts the validity, such as "expires"
is added later on, it is pretty important not to ignore it. Older clients
should refuse to comply.)
URL signing should indeed be addressed in a separate BIP and be an
extension mechanism, IMO.
"expires" and "message" could go into BIP 21 one as they're easy to
implement and don't need much discussion.

It's usually the right thing to do to be open to future backward-compatible
changes, but I don't know of any such standard, as it equally makes future
non-backward-compatible changes impossible.
Whatever will be defined in the BIP is the standard in this case.
Which is exactly what I want to avoid by defining this up-front.
A versioning scheme can avoid this. Any BIP that breaks backwards
compatibility (for example, adds a multiple-send type or specific
restriction) should increase the version number. A client rejects URLs with
a version number higher than what it knows about.
That's the simplest way to handle it, and enough IMO.

Just my two cents -- I'm against removing the overview page or moving it to
the wiki. I think other open source clients deserve a mention on the
bitcoin.org page.
Many new people are looking for a good Android client, for example. Rather
than randomly searching on Google or the app store, it's much safer to
follow the link from bitcoin.org. Others are looking for a light clients
because they think the Satoshi one is too heavy.
Again, rather than following random links on a search engine or wiki (not
all users have the common sense required for this) it may be better if they
follow links "audited" (or at least discussed) by this community. I agree
with Jim here.
The reference client is already first in that it can be downloaded directly
from the main page of bitcoin.org. That should stay that way for the
considerable future, as it's the most proven.  The position in the alt
clients list is less important. That said, I'm not a big fan of randomized
order because it's confusing. Come back to the page and it's different.
Some other neutral ordering is probably possible.

Splitting the UI into a seperate *process* is a long-term goal. The UI code

under way.
However, the current RPC calls don't suffice to implement a full-featured,
responsive UI. I'm not even sure JSON-RPC is a good fit for a UI<->core
protocol, as it doesn't support bidirectional communication (at least
without pretty ugly hacks).
But what exactly is the problem with having a GUI as part of the main
client project? I don't see how it would "speed up development" to split
the project. By far most of the users use the program through the UI so it
is one of the drivers for requirements on the core, and I'd think it is

Capability-based systems (just look at OpenGL) tend to become horrendously

It's currently (nearly) stateless, however it would be short-sighted to

I like the idea of a capabilities command; as time goes on and the ecosystem
Which is a perfectly reasonable requirement. However, one could simply
standardize what a 'thin client' and what a 'thick client' does and offers
(at a certain version level), without having to explicitly enumerate
everything over the protocol.
This also makes it easier to deprecate (lack of) certain features later on.
You can simply drop support for protocol versions before a certain number
(which has happened before). With the extension system this is much harder,
which likely means you keep certain workarounds forever.
Letting the node know of each others capabilities at connection time helps
somewhat. It'd allow refusing clients that do not implement a certain
feature. Then again, to me it's unclear what this wins compared to
incremental protocol versions with clear requirements.
I'm just afraid that the currently simple P2P protocol will turn into a zoo
of complicated (and potentially buggy/insecure) interactions.
So maybe a capability system is a good idea but then the granularity should
be large, not command-level. The interaction between protocol versions and
capabilities needs to be defined as well. Does offering "getdata" at
protocol version 10 mean the same as offering it at protocol version 11"?
Probably not guaranteed. The arguments might have changed. So it's not
entirely self-documenting either.

I strongly support this too. It is good to make the protocol as

parsing and processing without referring to specific current
implementations of other libraries such as OpenSSL.
What always bothered me is that OpenSSL can change their API to accept
new obscure key encodings at some point, or change their
interpretation, and bitcoin will automatically change with it. As
bitcoin happily links against any OpenSSL version you provide it, in
worst case, this can result in forks and unexpected behavior

The economic parameters of Bitcoin are fixed in stone forever. Adding a

But these are ideas everyone is free to experiment with in new altcoins. If

Importing private keys into the wallet will not be added as a user-friendly

- Under "Now we will encrypt seedb. Derive a second key from passpoint

This has been discussed many times. But in any case: If you encounter this

Otherwise, when someone wants to send you BTC they need to request a new
receiving address from you. Along with this request they can also send a
message, over whatever channel is used to negotiate the payment.
If you're just posting a static bitcoin address somewhere for donations,
consider it an anonymous (wel, pseudonymous) gift jar.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Bitcoind-in-background mode for SPV wallets 
This is primarily aimed at developers of SPV wallets.
The recently reported decrease in number of full nodes could have several
reasons, one of them that less people are running Bitcoin Core for the
wallet because the other wallets are getting ahead in both features and
It's great to see innovation in wallets, but it's worrying that the number
of full nodes decreases.
It may be that lots of people would support the network by running a full
node, but don't want to go through the trouble of installing bitcoin core
separately (and get confused because it's a wallet, too).
Hence I'd like to explore the idea of adding an option to popular SPV
wallets, to spin a bitcoind process in the background. This could be pretty
much transparent to the user - it would sync in the background, the wallet
could show statistics about the node, but is not dependent on it.
In exchange the user would get increased (full node level) security, as the
SPV wallet would have a local trusted node.
Does this sound like a good idea?
Is there any way that Bitcoin Core can help to accomedate this 'embedded'
usage? Specific Interfaces, special builds - maybe add a walletless
bitcoind build to gitian - bindings, dlls, etc?

Bitcoins stands or falls with people running full nodes.
If no one wants to volunteer resources to support the network anymore,

Sorry. I don't think it will ever make sense to run full nodes on consumer
Most consumer hardware is much more powerful than 'cheap virtualized
servers'. More memory, disks are cheap, and at least in the Netherlands
home bandwidth is much cheaper than server bandwidth.
Also: any optimization that helps running on cheap servers will also help
running it on consumer hardware. It's not the one or the other.

My solution would be quick to implement and could help increase the number
of nodes in the short term. It will also smooth the way towards splitting
off the wallet from Bitcoin Core, by giving people a choice what wallet
they use with their full node.
That doesn't preclude looking for longer-term solutions that change the
incentive structure, but that is much more difficult and risky. I don't

Nothing I've proposed here would require larger changes to the architecture

wallet, and that will need an interface to an bitcoind to allow 'running
with full node'. If that can be generalized to be useful for other (SPV)
clients as well, that would be useful, hence I asked for input.

I agree that there is a fundamental incompatibility in usage between
wallets and nodes. Wallets need to be online as little as possible, nodes
need to online as much as possible.
However, a full node background process could also be running if the wallet
is not open itself. Ffor example - by running as a system service.
Bitcoin Core's own wallet is also moving to SPV, so this means a general
solution is needed to get people to run a node when the wallet is not
Maybe the node shouldn't be controlled from the wallet at all, it could be
a 'node control' user interface on its own (this is what -disablewallet
does currently). In this case, there is no need for packaging it with a

I do agree that it is important.
This does require changes to the P2P protocol, as currently there is no way
for a node to signal that they store only part of the block chain. Also,
clients will have to be modified to take this into account. Right now they
are under the assumption that every full node can send them every
(previous) block.
What would this involve?
Do you know of any previous work towards this?

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Chain pruning 
Well with bitcoin, (average) time, number of blocks and (maximum) size are
all related to each other so it doesn't matter how it is specified, it's
always possible to give estimates of all three.
As for implementation it indeed makes most sense to work with block ranges.
This assumes that nodes will always be storing the latest blocks. For
dynamic nodes that take part in the consensus this makes sense.
Just wondering: Would there be a use for a [static] node that, say, always
serves only the first 100000 blocks? Or, even, a static range like block
100000 - 200000?

The use case is that you could burn the node implementation + block data +
a live operating system on a read-only medium. This could be set in stone
for a long time.
There would be no consensus code to keep up to date with protocol
developments, because it doesn't take active part in it.
I don't think it would be terribly useful right now, but it could be useful
when nodes that host all history become rare. It'd allow distributing
'pieces of history' in a self-contained form.
Yes, it would be nice to at least be able to express it, if it doesn't make
the protocol too finicky.
In terms of peer selection, if the blocks you need aren't covered by
That makes sense.
In general, if you want a block 50 from the tip, it would be best to
request it from a node that only serves the last N (N>~50) blocks, and not
a history node that could use the same bandwidth to serve earlier, rarer
blocks to others.

Probably - but that's a very rare edge case. People that are security

While forcefully dropping XP support would seem like a waste of time, and
The _WIN32_WINNT define that is used (0x0501) makes Windows XP the lowest
version that the software will run on. It would be trivial to bump this to
Windows Vista (0x0600).
But in that case the user won't get a helpful message, the software will
outright refuse to run. So I thought, maybe it makes sense to show a
message that XP support is going to be removed - which must happen sooner
or later.
The insecurity of the platform adds urgence to this. So I thought "let's
ask for advice on the mailing list".
But what I get is contortions into unrelated topics (what does auto-update
have to do with this?), paranoid banter about 'manipulating users',
diversions into other topics. Sure, there's a thin line between being
helpful and being seen as manipulative, but it's over the top to compare
this with in-browser banners. It could be so much as a one-time message.

Qt is not part of the compiler/build environment. Thus we don't need

As I said: we can easily build against Qt 4.6 instead. As said, that
wouldn't even need building Qt on linux, just unpacking and exporting

He wants to use it to advertise services that are not part of the P2P

It also wouldn't work. A bit is not enough to find an external service
except in the naive case where the advertised service would have a
fixed port. Not even bitcoind has a fixed port. So there needs to be a
mechanism to find how to connect to the 'external service'. This is
provided by the proposed extension.
It would in principle be possible to advertise an extra service bit
*in addition to* this one, to make it easier to find through the addr
mechanism. But it  would be confusing and IMO an abuse of P2P service

This diverges from the topic but seems like a good idea to me in
general, not so much as replacement for jgarzik's proposal.
Something like `getutxos` or this proposal could be implemented as an
external application or script, instead of having to integrate
everything into bitcoind.
Bitcoind would need a local interprocess message bus for that, and
would need to act as router for messages from/to the P2P network.
ZeroMQ seems like a good choice for that. That's not completely crazy
as there are already plans to add zeromq as an optional dependency for
notifications [1].

well make P2P messages available to other applications (if they

When flushwallet is disabled, the wallet is not flushed (written to
disk in a self-contained state) periodically. This means that there's
a larger chance that the wallet database is in inconsistent state when
the process stops unexpectedly. This can happen either due to a crash,
or an external cause such as the power turning off unexpectedly.
With the wallet in non-self-contained state, the next time that you
start bitcoind BerkeleyDB will have to process log files. There is a
non-zero chance that this will fail and manual recovery is needed.
As the wallet is usually critical, it is unwise to disable that option.

It already happens with 8 peers that if you have lousy peers, the
transaction doesn't reach the network on the first broadcasting. When
sending to only one random peer it will likely be even worse.
I guess the wallet could send out the transaction 'staggered' over
time. It could pick a random new node, broadcast the transaction, wait
a bit, pick a new node, broadcast the transaction until it is comes
back through one of the other peers.
Separating the transaction broadcasting (of the wallet) from, for
example, the nodes used to request blocks from could make sense. Maybe
doubly so if bloom filters are involved.

  Upgrading and downgrading
How to Upgrade
The 'chainstate' for this release is not always compatible with previous
releases, so if you run 0.9.x and then decide to switch back to a
0.8.x release you might get a blockchain validation error when starting the
old release (due to 'pruned outputs' being omitted from the index of
unspent transaction outputs).
Running the old release with the -reindex option will rebuild the chainstate
data structures and correct the problem.
Also, the first time you run a 0.8.x release on a 0.9 wallet it will rescan
the blockchain for missing spent coins, which will take a long time (tens
of minutes on a typical machine).
0.9.3 Release notes
- Avoid a segfault on getblock if it can't read a block from disk
- Add paranoid return value checks in base58
Protocol and network code:
- Don't poll showmyip.com, it doesn't exist anymore
- Add a way to limit deserialized string lengths and use it
- Add a new checkpoint at block 295,000
- Increase IsStandard() scriptSig length
- Avoid querying DNS seeds, if we have open connections
- Check redeemScript size does not exceed 520 byte limit
- Ignore (and warn about) too-long redeemScripts while loading wallet
- fix 'opens in testnet mode when presented with a BIP-72 link with no fallback'
- AvailableCoins: acquire cs_main mutex
- Fix unicode character display on MacOSX
- key.cpp: fail with a friendlier message on missing ssl EC support
- Remove bignum dependency for scripts
- Upgrade OpenSSL to 1.0.1i (see
 - just to be sure, no
critical issues for Bitcoin Core)
- Upgrade miniupnpc to 1.9.20140701
- Fix boost detection in build system on some platforms

reason for prioritizing the consensus library is that it is the first
step toward the goal of isolating the consensus code completely. As
soon as it exists in a repository by itself, it is easier to enforce a
different regime of change control there, or even freeze it completely
over time. To keep track of consensus changes one'd only have to
follow that repository, instead of filter it between tons of GUI, RPC

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Bitcoin address TTL & key expiration? 
Payment request expiration was meant to address this.
Adding an optional expiration timestamp to addresses would be
possible, however, it would be a non-backward-compatible change and
lots of software would have to be changed at this point.
In my opinion encouraging the use of the payment protocol and
deprecating the use of addresses is the best way forward, and not just
for this reason.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Bitcoin address TTL & key expiration? 
Couldn't these services return a payment message instead of an address?
I agree that there is currently an UI issue here: there is no way in
current wallets to store a payment message and pay to it later. We
will need something like that for recurring payments as well.
Bitcoin addresses were never designed with extensibility in mind.
Before the payment protocol there have been lots of ideas to add
functionality to them, but the underlying idea that they have to be
handled by users manually means that they have to be as short as
possible, which is a conflicting aim with extensibility...

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Policy for DNS seeds 
We've established a few basic rules for the DNS seeds as used in the
Bitcoin Core software. See below.
If you run one of the DNS seeds please reply to this and let us know
whether you agree to these terms. if you think some requirements are
unreasonable let us know too. If we haven't heard from you by
2014-08-04 we will remove your DNS seed from the list of defaults.
Expectations for DNSSeed operators
Bitcoin Core attempts to minimize the level of trust in DNS seeds,
but DNS seeds still pose a small amount of risk for the network.
Other implementations of Bitcoin software may also use the same
seeds and may be more exposed. In light of this exposure this
document establishes some basic expectations for the expectations
for the operation of dnsseeds.
0. A DNSseed operating organization or person is expected
to follow good host security practices and maintain control of
their serving infrastructure and not sell or transfer control of their
infrastructure. Any hosting services contracted by the operator are
equally expected to uphold these expectations.
1. The DNSseed results must consist exclusively of fairly selected and
functioning Bitcoin nodes from the public network to the best of the
operators understanding and capability.
2. For the avoidance of doubt, the results may be randomized but must not
single-out any group of hosts to receive different results unless due to an
urgent technical necessity and disclosed.
3. The results may not be served with a DNS TTL of less than one minute.
4. Any logging of DNS queries should be only that which is necessary
for the operation of the service or urgent health of the Bitcoin
network and must not be retained longer than necessary or disclosed
to any third party.
5. Information gathered as a result of the operators node-spidering
(not from DNS queries) may be freely published or retained, but only
if this data was not made more complete by biasing node connectivity
(a violation of expectation (1)).
6. Operators are encouraged, but not required, to publicly document
the details of their operating practices.
7. A reachable email contact address must be published for inquiries
related to the DNSseed operation.
If these expectations cannot be satisfied the operator should
discontinue providing services and contact the active Bitcoin
Core development team as well as posting on bitcoin-development.
Behavior outside of these expectations may be reasonable in some
situations but should be discussed in public in advance.

There is also a java-based 'comparison tool' that tests high-level

acts as an external node. This is not part of the github bitcoin

See All of the wallet code is in `src/wallet.cpp` and `src/walletdb.cpp`.
If the purpose is just studying, the bitcoin core wallet is not the
most readable wallet code around, and also hard to port as it relies
on a full node in the same process. It's better to look at SPV
wallets, for example the bitcoinj-based ones.
Something like that would be useful, yes.

harder (but possible). There is work in progress to make building the
dependencies easier for those.

  Upgrading and downgrading
How to Upgrade
The 'chainstate' for this release is not always compatible with previous
releases, so if you run 0.9.x and then decide to switch back to a
0.8.x release you might get a blockchain validation error when starting the
old release (due to 'pruned outputs' being omitted from the index of
unspent transaction outputs).
Running the old release with the -reindex option will rebuild the chainstate
data structures and correct the problem.
Also, the first time you run a 0.8.x release on a 0.9 wallet it will rescan
the blockchain for missing spent coins, which will take a long time (tens
of minutes on a typical machine).

I'm pretty sure that all the side effects of assertions have been removed

However, the assertion checks are extremely important to the proper sanity

I think most concerns about the current use of asserts would be resolved if
Also, most assertion errors that happen to people running Bitcoin Core are
not caused by software bugs but database corruption errors (usually due to
unclean shutdown).
For example in case we detect missing/truncated block files or UTXO db
consistency we should, instead of raising an assertion error, propose a
-reindex - see also  .
So instead of using assertions we need a fatal error function for those
problems which are probably recoverable in a certain specific way. In
principle starting a reindex wouldn't even need to take down the entire
process (though that's easier for implementation due to cleanup and
assumptions made).

I was just doing what was always done. In practice, the translations
follow a very different cycle than the rest of the code. Entering
translations as well as reviewing them happens inside Transifex.
Sure, someone could "maliciously change strings". It's typical that
this little bikeshedding topic attracts so much attention.
But if it makes all of you happy I won't do the translation update.

There is some postprocessing done in the script that fetches
translation files (see

check for number and presence of formatting characters. I generally
check that by manually looking through the diffs. But would be great
if someone added that.

( I suggest we adapt a
string-based name space for extensions.
A new network version could add a command 'getextensions' to query the
supported extensions, returning a list of extension strings or
(extension,version) pairs. For BIPs some something like 'BIP0064'
could be defined, but for an experiment for example
'experimental-getutxo'. This would be easy to implement and specify.
Unlike with the 64 service bits it does not require (as much) central
coordination to assign as there is no real danger of collisions. It
takes the political aspect out of P2P network extensions, and gives
more freedom to alternative implementations to experiment with their
own extensions. And no more need for bitcoin core to drive what must
be supported with increasing network versions.

Anyhow, if we like to bike-shed so much:

And they're ugly to use as well.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Plans to separate wallet from core 
It's least surprising if the wallet works as a SPV client by default.
Then, users can use it without first setting up a core. Thus the idea
would be to use P2P primarily.
There could be a mode to use a trusted core by RPC for
mempool/conflicted transaction validation and such. But I'm not sure
about this - as we've seen, pure-SPV wallets work pretty well. If you
want it to act as an edge router you can point a SPV wallet at your
trusted core as well.
There are no plans for adding Electrum-like functionality to bitcoind.
There is already Electrum. Let's not reinvent any wheels.
Right, the wallet would keep track of those.
It does not need to keep a full chain database. But it needs its own
record of the chain, headers-only + what concerns the keys in the

Yes, they will share code. At least the basic data structures and
serialization and deserialization. Probably also part of the network
code and utilities like argument parsing (although that's not a hard
requirement - it may be an opportunity to do things better).
So part of Bitcoin Core will have to be turned into a library or
libraries. Movement toward this is already in progress for a while.
We want to move away from "full node wallets". In the beginning it
made some sense to jump-start the network, but the more the chain
grows the less unwieldy they become.
My main argument for the split is that full nodes and wallets have
completely different usage scenarios:
- A wallet should be online as little as possible, ideally only when
you do transactions or want to check for them.
- A full node should be online 24/7 or it is virtually useless to the network.
I suggest you look at the interface for Electrum. It probably does
exactly what you expected the interface between the Bitcoin Core
wallet and Bitcoin Core to become. Electrum server keeps some extra
indices that can be queried by the wallets. It already exists!
But IMO this is a passed stage. SPV wallets w/ Bloom filtering can
work without any special servers, so why require a 'close binding' to
a trusted bitcoin core?
(As said - I'm fine with optional close binding to a core using RPC
with slight security benefits like utxo queries and conflicted
transaction checking, and to get the dynamic fee data, but it should
not be required)
To not require having a bitcoind node always running alongside it.

I don't intend to work on that myself but that's up to the people that
want to contribute to that. Once it's a separate project it could
either be a big success, or it could slowly wither away. It can have a
release cycle separate from the node. Likely faster.
The organizational reason to split off the wallet is to get rid of
that responsibility (and code) from the bitcoind repo. Maintaining a
wallet should not be part of maintaining the core infrastructure. But
just deleting it would be unreasonable.
Hah. I've thought about that migration path as well.
a quick and easy way to set up a wallet as a daemon, to use the
functionality from non-java through RPC.
But there are other interesting upcoming wallet projects as well, for
example CoinVault.

To clarify (and not piss off ThomasV :-): I do not think the idea of
having servers with a reputation of their own is a passed stage. There
are many things that cannot be done at SPV level security with just
the P2P protocol yet. So having fewer but more trusted Electrum
servers is a reasonable compromise.
But for basic wallet functionality it isn't necessary.

ou did want to separate the wallet code from the full node then that'd be
Do mind that some of the steps on the path of bitcoind towards SPV are
also useful in general. For example, headers-first allows parallel
block download, which would solve a lot of sync issues people are
having - a much higher priority than the wallet.
But anyhow I'm describing how I would do it. If you're going to do it,
you can do it in any order that you want. As we're talking about a
separate project here it's not even clear who will be maintainer.
I don't understand your argument against Electrum here. Dependencies?
Come on, that's a matter of software distribution. If that really
bothers you I suppose you could contribute to Electrum server so that
it has less deps. It doesn't make the protocol worth any less.
Although Pieter and I disagree with regard to issue  we agree on
wanting to keep (or at least making) bitcoind as lean as possible.
Maintaining extra indices for others doesn't fit in there - that's
also why the address index patch was not merged. An 'index node' could
be a different animal.

As I've said before -- and I think we disagree here - I like moving
towards a bag of parts of specialized tools, maintained by people that
specialize in those tools, instead of a single project that aims to do
and know everything. This encourages experimentation  and makes
competition possible and I think that is healthy in this space.
Bitcoin has a strict need for consensus in the block chain format,
scripting system and validation. Outside of those, innovation should
be possible without any gatekeeper bottleneck or even widespread
agreement. Wallets, what data to store on disk, what indices to
maintain. But even P2P message extensions, as long as it doesn't
interfere with the rest of the network.
After an experiment is successful it could always be merged into
bitcoin core. But then the 'what-ifers' have less ammo, as it has been
tested in the real world.
For user convenience it's still possible to package pre-assembled
bags. But that doesn't need to figure into how things are developed.

I haven't been talking about the GUI at all in this entire

very few reasons for running a wallet 24/7. One could be if you're
running an exchange that has to send and receive transactions all the
But that's an exception - in the usual merchant/end-user case you're
mostly receiving transactions and sometimes manually or batched-
sending them. No need to leave the wallet running, exposed to the
network outside those times.
How the wallet GUI (if any) relates to the wallet code is a completely
different topic, and a much less pressing matter. Anything from 'GUI
uses wallet as a library' (multibit, electrum, bitcoin core) to
elaborate client-server protocols (btcd, coinvault?) are acceptable
depending on the use case.

If it involves any imagery or graphics we do need contributions (with the

Such a thing would be interesting for a future BIP standard. I see one
problem here: for an unsigned payment request there isn't really an
"origin". Browser URI handlers don't send the referrer either.
This rules out adding a field to the Bitcoin URI 'requests from us must be
signed from now on' (there's no us).
The server that serves the payment requests *could* serve an HSTS-like
header 'only accept signed payment requests from us from now on'. The
client needs to remember this for this server. Then if someone has
compromised that server (or hijacked DNS) to serve fake and unsigned
payment requests, the client can block these.
Neither scenario will help in the case in which the server serving the
Bitcoin URIs is compromised.

We'd already decided that we would need something like Python for the
stats service. Implementing things like web services in C++ is just
not realistic given the time constraints and the great already-written
code that is out there. As an optional tool it should be external, not
part of bitcoind itself.

Must say it looks very nice.
One comment about the graphs: in the 'connected peers' chart you
visualize some larger quantities (especially knownAddresses) and some
very small ones (peer.(dis)connect). This makes the latter invisible
due to scale.
Some random stats may be useful as well:
- Number of connected peers that are SPV clients or full nodes (NODE_NETWORK)
- Current block height (so that it's possible to detect stuck nodes)
- Number of transactions in mempool
- Number of transactions in UTXO set
- Maybe some fee statistics,
 would be useful here
- Number of orphan blocks/orphan transactions

@_date: 2014-05-19 10:48:52

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] About the small number of bitcoin nodes 
That's also possible through the RPC. See "getnettotals". You can also
get stats per peer in "getpeerinfo".
I also suggest looking at Jameson Lopp's Statoshi work
( if you like graphs and more detailed stats.
Yes, such a document would be very welcome.
Maybe coordinate with Sa?vann Carignan or David Harding, it could be
part of their bitcoin documentation project.
I agree with you that a default configuration file is useful,
*however* this does not need to be created by the daemon.
The idea would be to make bitcoind and its data and configuration
system-wide. See A daemon should not even have write access to its own configuration
files. To follow the example of apache, tor, and such the distribution
installs a default configuration file which the user can adapt.
This sounds good, but as usual the practice is much uglier.
Bitcoind was part of the Ubuntu default repos for a while, but they
don't upgrade versions as we need to. This resulted in Ubuntu 12.04
stable being stuck with 0.3.xx forever. It would be even worse for
Debian Stable, which has even older versions of packages.
So right now we need you to add the PPA to get the package for Ubuntu.
This is only a small extra step.
This has to be determined per distribution, though. In some distros
this may be perfectly possible. This is just another place where the
project is completely dependent on volunteers.
Sounds like a fun project for someone in Python. Most of the
information is already available through RPC (and if not, request
Some hacking with ncurses could quickly make a decent tool here. It
could be packaged with bitcoin itself but that's not necessary. For
example Tor has the tool 'arm' which is a separate package.
You may want to talk with Shawn Wilkinson he has some ideas in this
direction. See also the issue
 .
Running the node without wallet is already possible since 0.9.0 in two ways:
- ./configure --disable-wallet when compiling
- run with -disablewallet  (as you say)
This works both for the GUI and the daemon. You can use the resulting
node-only instance ("edge router") with any existing SPV wallet.
There are plans to split off the wallet so that it can run separately,
but I wouldn't be holding my breath.
It feels to me that the general direction things are going in is that
other wallet projects are advancing much faster than Bitcoin Core's
wallet and people will likely switch to other wallet projects for
wallet functionality. Bitcoin Core is moving to an edge router role.
I'm happy to be proven wrong here and would like to see someone work
on bitcoind's wallet, but with the current development resources we
have to focus on a what is most urgent: maintaining and improving the
Yes, it would be great of connectivity and proxy problems were
signaled in some way.
Detecting whether your port is closed from the outside is an imprecise
art at most, though, as it relies on information from others.
A first step could be showing the number of incoming and outgoing
connections separately in getnetworkinfo. If you have no incoming
connections after a while you can be fairly sure that there is no
outward connectivity.
What incentive do peers have to reconnect to you specifically? The
nature of a P2P network is that nodes are interchangeable. If a node
fails or kicks them, they'll just try the next node in the list.
Sometimes that will be you, sometimes it will not.

There is already an (old) patch that implements that. It won't be

Only when the node can download blocks from multiple peers at once it
is really safe to allow limiting rates.
(sure - there are tricks to limit rates anyway, like the script in

needs to be more robust first)

Hello all,
When you're contributing to Bitcoin Core development please sign your
git commits. This is easy to do and will help in assuring the
integrity of the tree.
How to sign your commits?
You can retroactively sign your previous commit using --amend, for example
    git commit -S --amend
If you need to go further back, you can use the interactive rebase
command with 'edit'. Replace HEAD~3 with the base commit from which
you want to start.
    git rebase -i HEAD~3
Replace 'pick' by 'edit' for the commit that you want to sign and the
rebasing will stop after that commit. Then you can amend the commit as
above. Afterwards, do
    git rebase --continue
As this will rewrite history, you cannot do this when your commit is
already merged. In that case, too bad, better luck next time.
If you rewrite history for another reason - for example when squashing
commits - make sure that you re-sign as the signatures will be lost.

Would be incredible to have multisig for git commits as well. I don't
think git supports multiple signers for one commit at this point -
amending the signature replaces the last one - but it would allow for
some interesting multi-factor designs in which the damage when a dev's
computer is compromised would be reduced.
Sounds like a lot of work to get a good workflow there, though.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Increasing the OP_RETURN maximum payload 
Agreed. I'm in favor of increasing OP_RETURN size as well. Don't care
about the actual size.
(rationale: pruning is going to land soonish, and everything is better
than UTXO-polluting methods that encode everything into addresses such
as now used by cryptograffiti)

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Deanonymisation of clients in Bitcoin P2P 
In my experience the problem has always been getting bootstrapped.
Most nodes hardly give any hidden service nodes in their getaddr.
(this has been improved in master by including a set of hidden service
seed nodes)
But this assumes -onlynet=tor. Tor with exit nodes should be less
problematic, unless someone managed to DoSban all the exit nodes as
described in the paper (but I've never seen such an attack myself).
Right, there's something to be said for splitting your own transaction
submission from normal P2P networking and transaction relay.
(esp for non-SPV wallets which don't inherently leak any information
about their addresses)
There was a pull request about this for Bitcoin Core one, maybe I
closed it unfairly  .

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] bitcoind as a library 
The plan is to provide the consensus functionality as a library, the
essential parts that make bitcoin bitcoin.
0.10 will have a basic transaction/script verifier available.
In the version after that, I expect this will be extended to further
utxo set management, but no API has been worked out for that yet.
There are also plans to add a library for transaction signing.
However there is no goal to expose *everything* as a library.
Certainly not wallet- or user interface related functionality.
Specialized utility libraries would fill this purpose better.
See for example  for base58 processing.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] [BIP draft] CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY - Prevent 
The next minor release (0.9.4) could have Gavin's change already.
I don't think CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY will make it into the next major
release though. Once headers-first and pruning is merged (which is
expected to be a matter of weeks). I'd like to split off the 0.10
branch and give it some time to stabilize with a feature freeze, then
do a release before the end of the year.
So 0.11, in say 6 months, would be soonest.

Why would you think so? Orphan blocks are blocks whose parent is not
known. In the case of a reorganization the client 'jumps' to a new
best chain, for this to happen the original tip and the new best tip
and all their parents must be already known.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Malleable booleans 
Off topic nit: I think you're confused with custom BOOL typedefs in C?
C++ booleans are protected against this (C++ standard ?4.7/4 according
to Google).:
 int main()
    bool myBool;
    myBool = 2;
    if (myBool == true)
        printf("It is true!\n");
    else if (myBool == false)
        printf("It is false!\n");
    else
        printf("It is something else!\n");
Prints 'It is true'. You can also use bool(something) as equivalent of
`x != 0`; as in `assert(bool(2) == true);`.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] BIP process 
I'm trying to create a bit of process around the
 repository.
A) Currently a lot of pulls are open for various BIPs and it is not
clear who should comment on them, or who decides on changes to be
Currently all BIP changes have to go through the Bitcoin Core team,
which is a narrow bottleneck and makes little sense when you think
about it. But I don't want to go back to the wiki state in which
everyone can make arbitrary changes to any BIP - we need to distribute
the process somehow.
I'd like to propose to make the author (or someone they delegate to)
the primary contact for each BIP. They should comment on changes, and
either accept or reject them. If they accept them, the change will be
Of course this means that there is a responsibility for the author to
adhere to BIP 1. For example if your BIP is final, don't allow any
technical changes. To do small clarifications, spelling or adding
implementations or examples is OK, but changing or adding to a
protocol is not - this needs a new BIP. Changing your BIP status
without community consensus is also not OK.
B) I also think it makes sense to move the BIP discussion (both about
the BIP process and individual BIPs) to a separate mailing list.
bitcoin-development currently has a dual function: discussion of
Bitcoin Core implementation concerns, as well as global changes to
Bitcoin (in the form of BIPs).
This makes the list too busy for some people, but it is critical that
everyone writing a Bitcoin node or client is up-to-date with proposals
and can comment on them.

@_date: 2014-10-15 10:47:18
@_author: Wladimir 
@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Proposed BIP status changes 
These BIPs should go to Final state - they are implemented all over
the place, and are thus entirely fixed in place now. Any changes would
require a new BIP as amandment:
- BIP 14 (BIP Protocol Version and User Agent)
- BIP 21 (URI Scheme)
- BIP 22 (getblocktemplate - Fundamentals)
- BIP 31 (Pong Message)
- BIP 34 (Block v2, Height in coinbase)
- BIP 35 (mempool message)
- BIP 37 (Bloom filtering)
Let me know if you (don't) agree.

@_date: 2014-10-15 11:36:58
@_author: Wladimir 
@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] BIP process 
Indeed, pull requests don't have a "status".
It would be possible to (ab)use labels for this.
The drawback of labels is that only the repository team can set these,
there is no way to delegate. But I suppose it'd be possible to build
something on top of the github API that handles this.
Well - the only way to avoid that is to set a reasonable deadline,
after which there is a default decision. You'd hope this would
motivate people to get involved in time.

@_date: 2014-10-16 08:22:04
@_author: Wladimir 
@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Proposed BIP status changes 
Not really. BIP changes should be discussed on the mailing list,
that's the way to get community consensus (as specified in BIP1).

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] About watch-only addresses 
It has been merged. There is the "importaddress" RPC call, which works
the same as "importprivkey" except that you a pass it an address.
Yes - aim is in a few months, probably by the end of the year.
AFAIK there are no nightly builds at this moment. Warren Togami was
building them for a while (at  but he
stopped some time around June.
It's not recommended to use master without at least a little bit of
development/debugging experience of yourself (to trace down problems
when they appear), so it's best to build it yourself if you're going
to test day-to-day development versions.

@_date: 2014-10-19 11:49:48
@_author: Wladimir 
@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] BIP process 
The problem is not one of traffic, but of confusion of concerns, and of focus.
That specific questions about Bitcoin Core are being asked, for
example about watch-only functionality, in the same list where changes
to the entire system (BIPs) should be decided on doesn't make sense.
This has in practice caused some developers of alternative clients to
not subscribe to this list, even though they *should* follow BIP
discussion otherwise it makes no sense to have a process in the first

@_author: Wladimir 
@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Bitcoin Core 0.10 release schedule 
Now that headers-first is merged it would be good to do a 0.10 release
soon. Not *too* soon as a major code change like that takes some time
to pan out, but I'd like to propose the following:
- November 18: split off 0.10 branch, translation message and feature freeze
- December 1: release 10.0rc1, start Release Candidate cycle
That leaves three weeks until the freeze. After the release and branch
split-off, the RC cycle will run until no critical problems are found.
For major releases this is usually more painful than for stable
releases, but if we can keep to these dates I'd expect the final
release no later than January 2015.
Let's aim to have any pending development for 0.10 merged before
November 18. Major work that I'm aware of is:
- BIP62 ( - Verification library (  - Gitian descriptors overhaul, so that Gitian depends = Travis depends (
- Autoprune (
- Add "warmup mode" for RPC server (
- Add unauthenticated HTTP REST interface (
Let me know if there is anything else you think is ready (and not too
risky) to be in 0.10. You can help along the development process by
participating in testing and reviewing of the mentioned pull requests,
or just by testing master and reporting bugs and regressions.
Note: I intended the 0.10 release to be much sooner. The reason that
this didn't pan out is that I insisted on including headers-first, and
this took longer than expected. There seems to be a preference to
switch to a fixed (instead of feature-based) 6-month major release
schedule, ie
- July 2015: 0.11.0 (or whatever N+1 release is called)
- January 2016: 0.12.0 (or whatever N+2 release is called)
- July 2016: 0.13.0 (or whatever N+3 release is called)

ACK on the UI change,
I think it would be best to let the full-blown "miner policy class"
wait for 0.11.
OK, that's a low-risk change, it just makes what is now a constant configurable.

See the opening post from  it has some documentation on how
to use the API.
It would be nice to have some write-up about the current functionality
in the release notes, but there currently is none.
It's a RPC-side change, not a P2P-side change so it doesn't require a BIP.
It's not too late, it's not been merged yet.
Though a W3C standard takes a long time to pan out, and it may be more
useful to have this available rather than wait for the API to be
standardized (which means this will need to be postponed at least one
version). As you say, a new interface be added later under another
Note that we're only interested in exposing read-only, public data
which is already available in Bitcoin Core's internals.
We're not aiming to add a fully-fledged block explorer with (say)
address indexes. Although that could be part of the standard if it
allows implementations to support just a subset.
Anyhow - please coordinate this with Jeff Garzik, it's better to work
together here.

Cozz Lovan has been doing great work on Bitcoin Core's wallet code lately.
If anyone cares about Bitcoin Core's wallet, for example its

they can make it into 0.10:

[Qt] Call checkBalanceChanged() periodically instead for every updated tx

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] BIP72 amendment proposal 
Sounds like a good idea to me.
I had no idea that some clients were comparing addresses and amounts
in the URI with the payment request for security, that seems like a
hacky and inflexible way. This is much better.

@_date: 2014-09-13 10:53:34
@_author: Wladimir 
@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] BIP72 amendment proposal 
But if they can truncate they can just as well pass a completely
different hash that matches their payment request. If an attacker can
change the bitcoin: URI, this scheme is broken.
The point of the proposal is to make sure that the payment request
matches the URI. So *if* you communicate the URI by secure means, this
authenticates the associated payment request as well, even if fetched
by insecure means (such as http:...) itself.

  Upgrading and downgrading
How to Upgrade
The 'chainstate' for this release is not always compatible with previous
releases, so if you run 0.9.x and then decide to switch back to a
0.8.x release you might get a blockchain validation error when starting the
old release (due to 'pruned outputs' being omitted from the index of
unspent transaction outputs).
Running the old release with the -reindex option will rebuild the chainstate
data structures and correct the problem.
Also, the first time you run a 0.8.x release on a 0.9 wallet it will rescan
the blockchain for missing spent coins, which will take a long time (tens
of minutes on a typical machine).
0.9.3 Release notes
- Avoid a segfault on getblock if it can't read a block from disk
- Add paranoid return value checks in base58
Protocol and network code:
- Don't poll showmyip.com, it doesn't exist anymore
- Add a way to limit deserialized string lengths and use it
- Add a new checkpoint at block 295,000
- Increase IsStandard() scriptSig length
- Avoid querying DNS seeds, if we have open connections
- Remove a useless millisleep in socket handler
- Stricter memory limits on CNode
- Better orphan transaction handling
- Add `-maxorphantx=` and `-maxorphanblocks=` options for
control over the maximum orphan transactions and blocks
- Check redeemScript size does not exceed 520 byte limit
- Ignore (and warn about) too-long redeemScripts while loading wallet
- fix 'opens in testnet mode when presented with a BIP-72 link with no fallback'
- AvailableCoins: acquire cs_main mutex
- Fix unicode character display on MacOSX
- key.cpp: fail with a friendlier message on missing ssl EC support
- Remove bignum dependency for scripts
- Upgrade OpenSSL to 1.0.1i (see
 - just to be sure, no
critical issues for Bitcoin Core)
- Upgrade miniupnpc to 1.9.20140701
- Fix boost detection in build system on some platforms

  Upgrading and downgrading
How to Upgrade
Because release 0.10.0 and later makes use of headers-first synchronization and
parallel block download (see further), the block files and databases are not
backwards-compatible with pre-0.10 versions of Bitcoin Core or other software:
* Blocks will be stored on disk out of order (in the order they are
received, really), which makes it incompatible with some tools or
other programs. Reindexing using earlier versions will also not work
anymore as a result of this.
* The block index database will now hold headers for which no block is
stored on disk, which earlier versions won't support.
If you want to be able to downgrade smoothly, make a backup of your entire data
directory. Without this your node will need start syncing (or importing from
bootstrap.dat) anew afterwards. It is possible that the data from a completely
synchronised 0.10 node may be usable in older versions as-is, but this is not
supported and may break as soon as the older version attempts to reindex.
This does not affect wallet forward or backward compatibility.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Bitcoin core 0.11 planning 
Hello all,
The release window for 0.11 is nearing, I'd propose the following schedule:
2015-05-01  Soft translation string freeze
            Open Transifex translations for 0.11
            Finalize and close translation for 0.9
2015-05-15  Feature freeze, string freeze
2015-06-01  Split off 0.11 branch
            Tag and release 0.11.0rc1
            Start merging for 0.12 on master branch 2015-07-01  Release 0.11.0 final (aim)
In contrast to former releases, which were protracted for months, let's try to be more strict about the dates. Of course it is always possible for last-minute critical issues to interfere with the planning. The release will not be held up for features, though, and anything that will not make it to 0.11 will be postponed to next release scheduled for end of the year.

It looks like the part between paranthesis is speculation and should be left to a future BIP.

You don't necessarily need to send everyone the same nServices bits.
E.g. you could give whitelisted peers special privileges.
But only advertize the intersection of your supported services (eg those you offer to the general public) in `addr` messages.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Censorship 
Please, this has drifted so far from the goal of this list: bitcoin development, and technical and academic debate about that.
Meta-discussion of communities has no place here.
I'd say: in the spirit of permissionlessness, everyone can create a community or list about bitcoin. If you don't agree with the admin, create your own. That's more constructive use of everyone's time and energy than trying to pressure people to change their behavior on their own home turf.

Thanks for writing this up. Putting the progress, ongoing work and plans related
to scaling in context, in one place, was badly needed.
Sounds good to me.
There are multiple ways to get involved in ongoing work, where the community
can help to make this happen sooner:
- Review the versionbits BIP   - Compare and test with implementation: - Review CSV BIPs (BIP68  /        BIP112   - Compare and test implementation:       BIP-112: Mempool-only CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY

- Segwit BIP is being written, but has not yet been published.
  - Gregory linked to an implementation but as he mentions it is not completely
    finished yet. ETA for a Segwit testnet is later this month, then you can test as well.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] var_int ambiguous serialization 
In serialize.h lingo you are talking about CompactSize, not VarInt.
CompactSizes indeed have redundancy in their representation, i.e. the same number can be represented as up to four different byte sequences.
VARINTs have a different format that (AFAIK) isn't used anywhere in the block chain. See WriteVarInt / ReadVarInt. These were designed to not have any redundancy in their representation.
Are you sure that this is a current concern? Non-canonical CompactSizes are forbidden - in serialize.h this is flagged in ReadCompactSize.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Bitcoin Core 0.9.4 not on bitcoin.org? 
v0.9.4 is not really a release, just a tag in git.
It contains merely a workaround for a change in OpenSSL which caused problems - see Gregory Maxwell's post.
As the releases are statically built against OpenSSL, it is not
necessary to upgrade if you use releases from bitcoin.org. Hence no change on the site.
(but it can be used by people building from source, or distributions packages such as the Ubuntu PPA, which unwisely dynamically link OpenSSL)
Again, there hasn't been any 0.9.4 release, neither a release candidate or anything else.
Testing and such should be focused on the 0.10 release candidates.

Yes, standardizing on a format could be useful.
Just administrative trivia: this would be a new BIP, and not an amandment to BIP32. Excluding small language errors and clarifications in examples, BIPs are not changed after the fact.

bug fixes.

Upgrading and downgrading
How to Upgrade
Because release 0.10.0 makes use of headers-first synchronization and parallel
block download (see further), the block files and databases are not
backwards-compatible with older versions of Bitcoin Core or other software:
* Blocks will be stored on disk out of order (in the order they are
received, really), which makes it incompatible with some tools or
other programs. Reindexing using earlier versions will also not work
anymore as a result of this.
* The block index database will now hold headers for which no block is
stored on disk, which earlier versions won't support.
If you want to be able to downgrade smoothly, make a backup of your entire data
directory. Without this your node will need start syncing (or importing from
bootstrap.dat) anew afterwards. It is possible that the data from a completely
synchronised 0.10 node may be usable in older versions as-is, but this is not
supported and may break as soon as the older version attempts to reindex.
This does not affect wallet forward or backward compatibility.
Notable changes
Faster synchronization
This release automatically estimates how high a transaction fee (or how
high a priority) transactions require to be confirmed quickly. The default
settings will create transactions that confirm quickly; see the new
'txconfirmtarget' setting to control the tradeoff between fees and
confirmation times. Fees are added by default unless the 'sendfreetransactions' setting is enabled.
Prior releases used hard-coded fees (and priorities), and would
sometimes create transactions that took a very long time to confirm.
Statistics used to estimate fees and priorities are saved in the
data directory in the `fee_estimates.dat` file just before
program shutdown, and are read in at startup.
New command line options for transaction fee changes:
- `-txconfirmtarget=n` : create transactions that have enough fees (or priority)
so they are likely to begin confirmation within n blocks (default: 1). This setting
is over-ridden by the -paytxfee option.
- `-sendfreetransactions` : Send transactions as zero-fee transactions if possible (default: 0)
New RPC commands for fee estimation:
- `estimatefee nblocks` : Returns approximate fee-per-1,000-bytes needed for
a transaction to begin confirmation within nblocks. Returns -1 if not enough
transactions have been observed to compute a good estimate.
- `estimatepriority nblocks` : Returns approximate priority needed for
a zero-fee transaction to begin confirmation within nblocks. Returns -1 if not
enough free transactions have been observed to compute a good
RPC access control changes
A new HTTP API is exposed when running with the `-rest` flag, which allows
unauthenticated access to public node data.
It is served on the same port as RPC, but does not need a password, and uses
plain HTTP instead of JSON-RPC.
Assuming a local RPC server running on port 8332, it is possible to request:
- Blocks: - Blocks without transactions: - Transactions (requires `-txindex`): In every case, *EXT* can be `bin` (for raw binary data), `hex` (for hex-encoded
binary) or `json`.
For more details, see the `doc/REST-interface.md` document in the repository.
RPC Server "Warm-Up" Mode
For 0.10 the security of signing against unusual attacks has been
improved by making the signatures constant time and deterministic.
This change is a result of switching signing to use libsecp256k1
instead of OpenSSL. Libsecp256k1 is a cryptographic library
optimized for the curve Bitcoin uses which was created by Bitcoin
Core developer Pieter Wuille.
There exist attacks[1] against most ECC implementations where an
attacker on shared virtual machine hardware could extract a private
key if they could cause a target to sign using the same key hundreds
of times. While using shared hosts and reusing keys are inadvisable
for other reasons, it's a better practice to avoid the exposure.
OpenSSL has code in their source repository for derandomization
and reduction in timing leaks that we've eagerly wanted to use for a
long time, but this functionality has still not made its
way into a released version of OpenSSL. Libsecp256k1 achieves
significantly stronger protection: As far as we're aware this is
the only deployed implementation of constant time signing for
the curve Bitcoin uses and we have reason to believe that
libsecp256k1 is better tested and more thoroughly reviewed
than the implementation in OpenSSL.
[1] Watch-only wallet support
Starting from 0.10.0, the Bitcoin Core distribution includes a consensus library.
The purpose of this library is to make the verification functionality that is
critical to Bitcoin's consensus available to other applications, e.g. to language
bindings such as [python-bitcoinlib]( or
alternative node implementations.
This library is called `libbitcoinconsensus.so` (or, `.dll` for Windows).
Its interface is defined in the C header [bitcoinconsensus.h](
In its initial version the API includes two functions:
- `bitcoinconsensus_verify_script` verifies a script. It returns whether the indicated input of the provided serialized transaction correctly spends the passed scriptPubKey under additional constraints indicated by flags
- `bitcoinconsensus_version` returns the API version, currently at an experimental `0`
The functionality is planned to be extended to e.g. UTXO management in upcoming releases, but the interface
for existing methods should remain stable.
Standard script rules relaxed for P2SH addresses
Bitcoin Core 0.10 implements BIP 66, which introduces block version 3, and a new
consensus rule, which prohibits non-DER signatures. Such transactions have been
non-standard since Bitcoin v0.8.0 (released in February 2013), but were
technically still permitted inside blocks.
This change breaks the dependency on OpenSSL's signature parsing, and is
required if implementations would want to remove all of OpenSSL from the
consensus code.
The same miner-voting mechanism as in BIP 34 is used: when 751 out of a
sequence of 1001 blocks have version number 3 or higher, the new consensus
rule becomes active for those blocks. When 951 out of a sequence of 1001
blocks have version number 3 or higher, it becomes mandatory for all blocks.
Backward compatibility with current mining software is NOT provided, thus miners
should read the first paragraph of "Mining and relay policy enhancements" above.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] bloom filtering, privacy 
Hello Adam,
I have heard this idea of inverting the bloom filter before (possibly in  and as I see it it would indeed improve the privacy. Apart from privacy it would also lower the burden for nodes. A block scan with bloom filter is effectively a cheap DoS on a node.
In addition to that it will also avoid the 'transaction withholding attack' that is possible with the current bloom filtering, at least if the filter is e.g. committed to in the block header.
The drawback would be overhead - the bloom filter per block will have a significant size (to avoid false positives), and the client would have to fetch entire blocks that have its transactions in it.
I don't think that is so bad in practice, after all the % of blocks that will have transactions for a given wallet will generally be low, so the block size is amortized in a way. Of course, if the block size would be increased this would become worse.

Well x509 is an international standard in common use, you can't do much better with regard to portability. Your suggestion about HTTPS makes little sense, you do know what TLS uses x509 internally as well?
Re: protocol buffers, I don't know if it's the best possible one, but one serialization method had to be picked. If it weren't, we could still have still been discussing which one to use by now. Just like for JSON there are bindings for many languages.
Though JSON parsers are much more diverse, which people using Bitcoin Core's RPC have bumped into e.g. some have some problems handling large numbers. Something you wouldn't expect using a straightforward binary format. There's no obvious best choice.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Is there a way to estimate the maximum 
Yes, that about summarizes it.
The block chain is a single channel broadcasted over the entire world, and I don't believe it will ever be possible nor desirable to broadcast all the world's transactions over one channel.
The everyone-validates-everything approach doesn't scale. It is however
useful to settle larger transactions in an irreversible, zero-trust way. That's what makes the bitcoin system, as it is now, valuable.
But it is absurd for the whole world to have to validate every purchase of a cup of coffee or a bus ticket by six billion others.
Naively scaling up the block size will get some leeway in the short term, but I believe a future scalable payment system based on bitcoin will be mostly based on off-blockchain transactions (in some form) or that there will be a hierarchical or subdivided system (e.g. temporary or per-locale

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Libconsensus separated repository (was Bitcoin 
I don't see any reason why Bitcoin Core would not use the consensus library. Eating our own dogfood and such.
Biggest risk, as I've said before, is that the refactoring loading to a (more complete) consensus library will result in code that is no longer bug-for-bug compatible with previous versions, thus defeating its entire purpose and introducing fork risk.
If that can be avoided - for example by going from here to there using pure code moves, as you're trying to do - I'm all for it.
If the rest is done, this is the easy part :)
Code review capacity is still our greatest bottleneck.
And I don't see any way out of that, unfortunately.
I do really care about this.

All our downloads (even old ones) have recently been deleted from sourceforge, for this reason. They haven't been mentioned in Bitcon Core release announcements for a long time.
No opinion on the mailing list. Though I think it's less urgent. The issue of moving the mailinglist has come up before a few times and people can't agree where to move to.

I completely agree here. I'm not against migration if a much better option comes along, but e.g. paying for another provider sounds like nonsense when sourceforge does this for free (with some minor annoyances - other providers will have their own).
Paying per message is far-fetched, something that could work in economic theory with perfectly spherical people in their perfectly efficient market. In practice the likely result would be a mailing list only used for advertisement and promotion, and technical discussion and release announcements would disappear.

Bitcoin Core is completely different from your average open source project in one aspect: where it concerns consensus.
Like in any open source project there is lots of decision making ability for code changes. I'd say look at the changelog for e.g. 0.11  or follow pull requests for a while, to see how many decisions about changes are made from day to day. No, I'm not sitting on my hands, and so is none of the other contributors that you'd like to get rid of.
Consensus changes are *much* more difficult, on the other hand. Even relatively straightforward softforks come with a long discussion process (see BIP62, BIP66). A hardfork is hard to do at the best of times (everyone needs to upgrade their software!), and simply not possible if almost the entire technical community disagrees with you.
Bitcoin is supposed to be a robust, global, decentralized network beyond anyone's control. It makes *no sense* to try to run it as a dictatorship. This would create a handy central position where power can be applied, pushing through changes to the behavior of the system, either by force or other ways of motivation. I refuse to take part in that.
Hence, anything that is controversial needs to be considered really carefully. If I suddenly start making changes to the consensus code without full agreement, by all means take away my commit privileges.
(a major reason for the ongoing libconsensus work is to separate "Bitcoin Core, the node software" and "The Bitcoin Consensus" along clear lines, to avoid this kind of nasty confusion)

Not much more than two, in ~5500 commit over six years. I feel sorry for you that `getutxos` was rejected in a messy way, still you are so held up about it and keep repeating it as if it is a daily occurence. Disingenuous, at the least.

Sure. According to github, there exist 4890 forks of the bitcoin/bitcoin repository.
Forking the code is perfectly fine in itself, that doesn't even need to be said, it's how open source works. Make your changes, run your own version, contribute back the changes (or not).
And I never had a problem with Bitcoin-XT while it was just a patch-set with no consensus changes. But a controversial hard fork of the chain is something else completely.

It looks as if you entirely missed my point. I'm The Decider for *code issues* regarding Bitcoin Core. Consensus issues should not be considered part of that, they span multiple implementations.
So I'm *not* the decider for anything that concerns the behavior of the global consensus, and I cannot be, as I have explained in the previous post, and as Sipa explained in his.
Speaking of process, let me remind you that there is a BIP processs:  If you think it's not clear enough, which may explain why you did not even attempt to follow it for your block size increase, feel free to make improvements.

So then: make a proposal for a better process, post it to this list.
In practice there has been zero interest in improving the BIP process.
E.g. the BIP process was adapted from the Python Enhancement Proposals by Amir Taaki (in 2009 or so?). It hasn't really changed since then, apart from some spelling and grammar corrections. It is not specifically adapted to Bitcoin, and doesn't make a distinction between for example, consensus changes and non-consensus changes.
So that's up to someone to do. You seem to be enthousiastic about it, so go ahead.

Again, for the last time: Bitcoin Core maintainer does not decide about protocol or consensus level changes.
This is not a role for me. Find someone else, if you think you need an arbiter. There was an idea about a Bitcoin Standards Body once, but as far as I know that's not actively being worked on.
BTW: for more exposure a proposal is better posted as a new thread, not as a deep reply to an existing topic.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] The need for larger blocks 
Hash: SHA512
Fully agree Pieter. Couldn't have stated it better.
It has been disappointing and scary to see political pressure tactics being used to change a distributed consensus system. By using the system everyone agreed on one set of consensus rules, that was the "social contract" of Bitcoin. To me, the consensus rules are more like rules of physics than laws. They cannot be changed willy-nilly according to needs of some groups, much less than lower gravity can be legislated to help the airline industry.
It is shocking to hear wide misunderstanding that it is supposedly 'the developers' that decide on such changes. As if this is merely a private top-down project. No, the point was that this can continue without any kind of central guidance, with expected stability. As a developer I work on improving the technical aspects and fixing bugs, not on 'governing' it.
By expecting a few developers to make controversial decisions you are breaking the expectations, as well as making life dangerous for those developers. I'll jump ship before being forced to merge an even remotely controversial hardfork.
The stressful conditions of last weeks have thus made me hostile toward the idea of hardforks. At least to hardforks that make politically loaded changes. In this case further centralization to well-connected geographic locales by increasing network bandwidth requirements.
Resiliency and decentralization are the key aspects. I would not want to risk breaking the system, or at least wildly changing its properties and applicability out of perceived necessity, and fear.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] The need for larger blocks 
At least there's always an 'exit' option. At this point it would be more realistic to create a sidechain, or altcoin with larger blocks, and not experiment with the current one in-flight. Then you won't risk the other 'passengers' who don't consent to it.
It's important to face reality instead of being wishful here. I'd also have preferred to have one happy family, but it is clear that is not the case, and pretending is only going to cause damage by creating false expectations, or eventually even double-spending possibility because of conflicting forks.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] The need for larger blocks 
Sure, most extreme: if secp256k1 or SHA256 starts to show chinks in its armor, or practical quantum computing is getting powerful enough to factor discrete logarithms of those sizes, I don't doubt everyone would go along with a proposal to add new crypto algos.
I do expect there are other possible hardforks that are uncontroversial. Either
- minor issues (maybe solving the time-warp issue with mining) issues planned on the long term
- features that are not politically loaded, on the long term
- major emergencies (anything that is clearly an 'exploit' with regard to coin holders or miners)
Not sure though. The only way to find out is to propose them and see. Maybe wait a bit until things have cooled down...
Note that anything non-critical and non-controversial can be planned and time-locked, say, 5 years ahead, obliviating the need for anyone to quickly upgrade their client.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] The need for larger blocks 
Yes, absolutely. Pushing something through despite a loud miniority (certainly a well-informed one with valid reasons) is controversial.
This is not about miniorities and majorities. The *entire network* needs to agree to switch to your new software. If there are months-long heated discussions on every possible forum that is a clear sign that your change is controversial. As Greg Sanders already says, we know one when we see one...

@_author: Wladimir J. van der Laan 
@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] The need for larger blocks 
You can change your client, individually, to anything you want. You can also decide to switch along with a hypothetical percentage of others. Say, 75% of the users wants to confiscate the other 25% their coins. It is not without historical precedent.
No matter what the split is, or what it is about, the overall result will be confusion and have much less value than when there was one consensus. It's not quite Mutually Assured Destruction, but it is a very bad position to be in for everyone. So I'd dare say it shouldn't happen.
But I'm done arguing about this too.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Improving resistance to transaction 
The user would have to select trusted peers or rely on a web of trust to
pick them. Experience with other networks such as Retroshare shows that
not only this is a lot of work to use, mistakes are easily made. It
will only protect the privacy of those that know what they're
doing and who they're trusting.
Otherwise, paradoxally this could reduce privacy, as the trusted peers
necessarily know (part of) your identity to be able to exchange keys
out-of-band. (and in practice most people are easily tricked into adding someone as
'friend', for Retroshare here is a case in which a law firm did this and
thus could sue people for making files available...)
Indeed, if the goal is to make a secure connections between nodes that
know and trust each other, this could employ any kind of tunnelling on top
of the P2P protocol. CurveCP would be one option. As said I'm not convinced this will help with privacy, but this could be
used for whitelisting: trusted nodes could be subjected to fewer DoS
Seperating the transaction submission from normal node functionality
would already go a long way, and that can be done without any protocol
changes. The transaction submitter would connect to a few nodes
through Tor and drop off a transaction, then disconnect. It would not
advertise itself as the hidden service, and should also use a different
Tor circuit as the node connections.
This could even work if the normal node functionality does not go
through Tor - although then one'd have to be even more careful about
any kind of residual fingerprinting or timing attacks.

@_author: Wladimir J. van der Laan 
@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Block Size Increase 
I'm weakly against a block size increase in the near future. Some arguments follow. For sake of brevity, this ignores the inherent practical and political issues in scheduling a hardfork.
1. The everyone-verifies-everything approach inherently doesn't scale well. Yes, it is possible to increase the capacity, within limits, without completely destroying the system, but if scaling turns out to be a success, even a 20-fold increase is just a drop in the bucket (this will not make a decentralized Changetip possible). The gain will always be linear, at a total cost that scales in the number of (full node) users times the block size. The whole idea of everyone verifying the whole world's bus tickets and coffee purchases seems ludicrous to me. For true scaling, as well as decentralized microtransactions, the community needs to work on non-centralized 'level 2' protocols for transactions, for example the Lightning network.
  I prefer not to rely on faith that 'Moore's law' - which isn't a physical law but a trend - will save us. And it doesn't so much apply to communication bandwidth as its techniques are more diverse. E.g. for Bitsat, 20MB blocks will push the limit.
2a. Pushing up bandwidth and CPU usage will, inevitably, push people at the lower end away from running their own full nodes. Mind you, the sheer number of full nodes is not the issue, but Bitcoin's security model is based on being able to verify the shared consensus on one's own. A lot of recent development effort went into making the node software less heavy. Yes, one could switch to SPV, but that is a serious privacy compromise. In the worst case people will feel forced to move to webwallets.
  That was about sustained bandwidth - syncing a new node from scratch through the internet will become unwieldy sooner - this can be worked around with UTXO snapshots, but doing this in a way that doesn't completely pull the rug under the security model needs research (I'm aware that this could be construed the other way, that such a solution will be needed eventually and fast block chain growth just accelerates it).
2b. The bandwidth bound for just downloading blocks is ~4GB per month now, it will be ~52GB per month. Behind Tor and other anonimity networks, nodes will reveal themselves by the sheer volume of data transferred even to only download the block chain. This may already be the case, but will become worse. It may even become harmful to Tor itself.
3a. The costs are effectively externalized to users. I, hence, don't like calling the costs "trivial". I don't like making this decision for others, I'm not convinced that they are trivial for everyone. Besides, this will increase supply of block chain space, and thus push down transaction fees, but at cost to *all users*, even users that hardly do any transactions. Hence it favors those that generate lots of transactions (is that a perverse incentive? not sure, but it needs to be weighted in any decision).
3b. A mounting fee pressure, resulting in a true fee market where transactions compete to get into blocks, results in urgency to develop decentralized off-chain solutions. I'm afraid increasing the block size will kick this can down the road and let people (and the large Bitcoin companies) relax, until it's again time for a block chain increase, and then they'll rally Gavin again, never resulting in a smart, sustainable solution but eternal awkward discussions like this.
4. We haven't solved the problem of arbitrary data storage, and increasing the block size would compound that problem. More data storage more storage available for the same price - and up to 20x faster growth of the UTXO set, which is permanent (more externalization). More opportunity for pedonazis to insert double-plus ungood data, exposing users to possible legal ramifications.
1. First, the obvious: It gives some breathing room in a year (or whenever the hard fork is planned). If necessary, it will allow more transactions to be on-chain for a while longer while other solutions are being implemented.
2. *Allowing* 20MB blocks does not mean miners will immediately start making them. Many of them aren't even filling up to the 1MB limit right now, probably due to latency/stale block issues. This makes objection 2 milder, which is about *worst case* bandwidth, as well as 4, as the end result may not be 20MB blocks filled with arbitrary "junk".
3. Investment in off-chain solutions is guided by not only fee pressure, but also other reasons such as speed of confirmation, which is unreliable on-chain. This eases objection 3b. Whew, this grew longer than I expected. To conclude, I understand the advantages of scaling, I do not doubt a block size increase will *work* Although there may be unforseen issues, I'm confident they'll be resolved. However, it may well make Bitcoin less useful for what sets it apart from other systems in the first place: the possibility for people to run their own own "bank" without special investment in connectivity and computing hardware. Also the politics aspect (at some point it becomes a question of who decides for who? who is excluded? all those human decisions...) of this I don't like in the least. Possibly unavoidable at some point, but that's something *I*'d like to kick down the road.

Upgrading and downgrading
How to Upgrade
Because release 0.10.0 and later makes use of headers-first synchronization and
parallel block download (see further), the block files and databases are not
backwards-compatible with pre-0.10 versions of Bitcoin Core or other software:
* Blocks will be stored on disk out of order (in the order they are
received, really), which makes it incompatible with some tools or
other programs. Reindexing using earlier versions will also not work
anymore as a result of this.
* The block index database will now hold headers for which no block is
stored on disk, which earlier versions won't support.
If you want to be able to downgrade smoothly, make a backup of your entire data
directory. Without this your node will need start syncing (or importing from
bootstrap.dat) anew afterwards. It is possible that the data from a completely
synchronised 0.10 node may be usable in older versions as-is, but this is not
supported and may break as soon as the older version attempts to reindex.
This does not affect wallet forward or backward compatibility.

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely

bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).
Notable changes
Mining and relay policy enhancements
Bitcoin Core's block templates are now for version 3 blocks only, and any mining
software relying on its `getblocktemplate` must be updated in parallel to use
libblkmaker either version 0.4.2 or any version from 0.5.1 onward.
If you are solo mining, this will affect you the moment you upgrade Bitcoin
Core, which must be done prior to BIP66 achieving its 951/1001 status.
If you are mining with the stratum mining protocol: this does not affect you.
If you are mining with the getblocktemplate protocol to a pool: this will affect
you at the pool operator's discretion, which must be no later than BIP66
achieving its 951/1001 status.

I'm not sure that's the right way to go about verifing gpg keys.
Copy/pasting from webpages is going to run into padding/character set conversion issues, resulting in potential false negatives. If you want to verify mails, you have to verify the original mail, which archives don't make easy (or even possible).
So I'd do this:
The binary release signing key is signed by my normal key:
$ gpg --list-sigs 36C2E964
    pub   4096R/36C2E964 2015-06-24 [expires: 2017-02-13]

$ gpg --list-sigs 2346C9A6

as linked on the download page:

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 release schedule 
In principle, "feature freeze" means that any large code changes will no longer go into 0.12, unless fixing critical bugs. I'm not keen on postponing 0.12 for such reasons - after the HK workshop I'm sure that it will take some development/testing/review before code makes it into anything. Apart from that there's a good point to decouple consensus changes from Bitcoin Core major releases.
We've seen lot of release date drift due to "this and this change needs to make it in" in the past, that was a major reason to switch to a time-based instead of feature-based release schedule.
We can always do a 0.12.1.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Fwd:  Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 release schedule 
I'll interpret the question as "why is the Bitcoin Core software still <1.0.0". Bitcoin the currency doesn't have a version, the block/transaction versions are at v3/v1 respectively, and the highest network protocol version is 70011. Mostly because we don't use the numbers as a signaling mechanism. They just count up, every half year.
Otherwise, one'd have to ask hard questions like 'is the software mature enough to be called 1.0.0', which would lead to long arguments, all of which would eventually lead to nothing more than potentially increasing a number. We're horribly stressed-out as is.

May I remind you that by far, most of that investment is not in the Bitcoin Core software.
It is made to things building on top of the network/protocol, under the assumption that nothing really stupid will happen and the network will not go down etc.
This implies a level of trust in the node software to maintain consensus, but doesn't necessarily mean that all rough corners have been dealt with regarding implementation.
(but this is exactly the kind of argument I'm trying to avoid getting pulled into)
We certainly could, it is a decision to not to.

TL;DR disable UPnP in Bitcoin Core as soon as possible, if you still have it enabled.
Upgrading to 0.11.1rc2 or 0.10.3rc2 will also solve the issue, as they bundle a newer libupnpc (as well as disable upnp usage by default.) However these versions are still in the release candidate cycle, there is some risk in using test versions.

Instead of creating hardforks and all the drama around it I'd
encourage to do your experiments on sidechains, or altcoins. Forks of
the bitcoin chain wil needlessly confuse matters, especially if they
all gain their share of users. In theory an hardfork would be no
different than an altcoin with shared history, but without proper
measures "crosstalk" between forks of the same chain can make for a
messy separation.
(A fact often ignored, because those proposing forks assume they can
just run over people on the other side of the fork by sake of their
Also please don't confuse alternative implementations of the node
software - btcd, obelisk, etc - that try to implement the consensus
rules as faithfully as they can, or even use bitcoin core's consensus
code directly - with deliberate rule changes as done in bitcoin XT.
The former can cause an accidental fork (which will probably be
repaired), the latter exist to split off their chain.

blockchain.info had some problems here for a while. They were not using a full validating node underneath:
- Signatures were not verified properly. This resulted in some panic when it looked like (on their site) a massive number of very old coins were being spent.
- They were relaying loose coinbase transactions. This caused them to be instantly banned from nodes they were connected to.
So there's certainly some scope for fun with fuzzing those APIs.

All of these properties are contingent on the system being decentralized. Asking random end-users if they care if bitcoin is decentralized is like asking random people if they care if their drinking water is dihydrogen monoxide.
Both miner and full node over-centralization could result in
- Permission requirements to submit transactions (miners can be pressured to adhere to KYC rules)
- Transactions being reversed without consent (reorgs by the miner cartel)
- ...even dilution of their fraction of their ledger (if changing the rules becomes normal, I'm sure some smoothtalker could come up with arguments to raise the 21M cap. Another option would be to force the remaining people that are able to run full nodes to comply)
Bitcoin's properties don't come from magic. All its attractive properties are derived from decentralization, on spreading responsibility as widely globally as possible. Without that, it's just an inefficient ledger database.

As long as it's an open system, one can't require a specific license for everything added to the chain.
You could of course make the BIP advisory, but I'm not sure what that would help. You still wouldn't have any certainty what license the contents of block  would be under.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] libconsensus and bitcoin development process 
This is the same point I have been making to Jeff privately.
Refactors are a means to an end: a more modular, reusable and maintainable codebase. This goal is that new functionality can be plugged in more easily, and rebase work for e.g. functionality built on top can go down, not up, if it just hooks into well-defined interfaces here and there.
Although there has been a lot of progress, bitcoind's design is still too monolithic. To add a more involved feature, like say a new index over the block chain data, code needs to be touched all over the place. This change interacts with all other functionality, potentially breaking the base node functionality - risk for users that do NOT use the functionality. This increases risk and review time.
- *If possible* functionality should be built without changing bitcoind's code at all. An external process should be able to keep up to date with the chain, notice reorgs, and process block data accordingly. If bitcoind's interface does not allow that, or it is too difficult, that is what should be fixed. - *if not possible* then a change should at least touch the code in as few places as possible, and integrate with e.g. signal notification.
To name an example of it done right, IMO: Monero's 'simplewallet'. It is a command-line utility wallet that communicates with the node software, and remembers where it was in the chain, and processes changes to the chain state since its last invocation when it 'refreshes'. What is nice is that one can run an arbitary number of simplewallets against one node daemon, and unlike bitcoind's wallet it doesn't need to run as always-on daemon itself. It can be invoked when the user wants to do something with the wallet, or see if there are new transactions.
An index could be implemented entirely externally in a similar way, while still fully handling reorgs.
What one needs for that, I think, is a library that communicate with the node, and which offers functionality abstractly be similar to 'git pull': give me the tree path from my current known tip to the best tip, and supply the block hashes (and block data) along the way. My long-term vision of bitcoind is a P2P node with validation and blockchain store, with a couple of data sources that can be subscribed to or pulled from.

At Monday's code sprint we had a good idea to schedule a regular developer meeting in Attendance is of course voluntary, but it may be good to have a time that many people are expected to be present and current issues can be discussed.

I think scheduling the meeting in UTC (=Iceland time) makes sense internationally because different locales have different DST or no DST at all, so all in all that makes it more complex. It's true that this can make a convenient time less convenient half of the year, for some people, but I don't think there's a time that works for everyone anyway...

Hello all,
The next major release of Bitcoin Core, 0.12.0 is planned for the end of the year. Let's propose a more detailed schedule:
- Open Transifex translations for 0.12
- Soft translation string freeze (no large or unnecessary changes)
- Finalize and close translation for 0.10
- Feature freeze
- Translation string freeze
In December at least I will probably not get much done code-wise (Scaling Bitcoin Hongkong, 32C3, end of year festivities, etc), and I'm sure I'm not the only one, so let's leave that for last pre-RC bugfixes and polishing.
- Split off `0.12` branch from `master`
- Start RC cycle, tag and release `0.12.0rc1`
- Start merging for 0.13 on master branch
- Release 0.12.0 final (aim)

There appears to be common agreement on that.
The only source of some controversy is how to deploy: versionbits versus
IsSuperMajority. I think the versionbits proposal should first have code
out there for longer before we consider it for concrete softforks. Haste-ing
along versionbits because CLTV is wanted would be risky.
As you say, the underlying code has been merged for months in master, and seems to have had quite some eyes on it already.
It does need to be made sure that the backports are correct, however.
Although the tests do provide some assurance, I think those two pulls
require more review.

Microsoft ended support for Windows XP on [April 8th, 2014](
an OS initially released in 2001. This means that not even critical security
updates will be released anymore. Without security updates, using a bitcoin
wallet on a XP machine is irresponsible at least.
In addition to that, with 0.12.x there have been varied reports of Bitcoin Core
randomly crashing on Windows XP. It is [not clear](
what the source of these crashes is, but it is likely that upstream
libraries such as Qt are no longer being tested on XP.
We do not have time nor resources to provide support for an OS that is
end-of-life. From 0.13.0 on, Windows XP is no longer supported. Users are
suggested to upgrade to a newer verion of Windows, or install an alternative OS
that is supported.
No attempt is made to prevent installing or running the software on Windows XP,
you can still do so at your own risk, but do not expect it to work: do not

It is extremely unlikely that the wallet will eat your coins (always backup
nevertheless), but I can't guarantee there won't be some issue where the wallet

Exactly - the plan is that OpenSSL will, in due time, be a dependency only if the
GUI is enabled. Most of the work for that is already done but it has to be made

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 release candidate 1 available 
The term 'pruning', unfortunately is very much overused and overloaded in the
bitcoin ecosystem. Satoshi's paper refers to UTXO pruning. This is Pieter Wuille's "ultraprune",
which has been part of Bitcoin Core for more than three years.
Block pruning is not mentioned in that paper because it is just administrative,
the only reason that nodes store historical blocks at all is to serve it to other nodes,
as well as to catch up the wallet status and for -reindexes.
I don't have time to work on the release notes right now, but if someone else
wants to contribute that'd be awesome.
To give a quotum. The point is that the user can choose how much harddisk space they want to
dedicate to block storage.
Block data that is stored can be used by other software, or potentially be
served to other nodes. The latter is not implemented at the moment - it would require
a change to the P2P protocol, thus right now pruning nodes don't serve block
data at all.
There is no security compromise with pruning. Any value of N is intended to be safe.
Very low values would delete undo data that may be necessary in a reorganization,
but this is prohibited by argument checks.
Release notes are not meant as a replacement or supplement for documentation.
The documentation for -prune is this:
  -prune=
       Reduce storage requirements by pruning (deleting) old blocks. This mode
       is incompatible with -txindex and -rescan. Warning: Reverting this
       setting requires re-downloading the entire blockchain. (default: 0 =
       disable pruning blocks, >550 = target size in MiB to use for block
       files)
As said, there is no safe or unsafe value. The lowest acceptable value is just as safe
as storing everything.

Microsoft ended support for Windows XP on [April 8th, 2014](
an OS initially released in 2001. This means that not even critical security
updates will be released anymore. Without security updates, using a bitcoin
wallet on a XP machine is irresponsible at least.
In addition to that, with 0.12.x there have been varied reports of Bitcoin Core
randomly crashing on Windows XP. It is [not clear](
what the source of these crashes is, but it is likely that upstream
libraries such as Qt are no longer being tested on XP.
We do not have time nor resources to provide support for an OS that is
end-of-life. From 0.13.0 on, Windows XP is no longer supported. Users are
suggested to upgrade to a newer version of Windows, or install an alternative OS
that is supported.
No attempt is made to prevent installing or running the software on Windows XP,
you can still do so at your own risk, but do not expect it to work: do not
report issues about Windows XP to the issue tracker.
- From 0.13.1 onwards OS X 10.7 is no longer supported. 0.13.0 was intended to work on 10.7+, but severe issues with the libc++ version on 10.7.x keep it from running reliably. 0.13.1 now requires 10.8+, and will communicate that to 10.7 users, rather than crashing unexpectedly.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Completing the retirement of the alert system 
As it has been disabled in relevant software I think it's mostly symbolic at
this point, but yes, it makes sense to 'officially' retire the key. Let's
pin the date and make it widely known.
Doing this in organized fashion is much better than the whodunit that would
undoubtly follow when the key would simply leak, which could happen at any
time, as no one can know who it has spread to over all those years.
Re: timing, I'd say leave three months grace time after this announcement for
altcoins and such that may have accidentally have copied it to remove it, then
at the beginning of 2017 broadcast the final alert.
After that it's neutered, it's up to each of us that has the key to reveal it
or not or when. It's a historical curiosity then.

How to Upgrade
If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` (on Mac)
or `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` (on Linux).
The first time you run version 0.15.0 or higher, your chainstate database will
be converted to a new format, which will take anywhere from a few minutes to
half an hour, depending on the speed of your machine.
The file format of `fee_estimates.dat` changed in version 0.15.0. Hence, a
downgrade from version 0.15 or upgrade to version 0.15 will cause all fee
estimates to be discarded.
Note that the block database format also changed in version 0.8.0 and there is no
automatic upgrade code from before version 0.8 to version 0.15.0. Upgrading
directly from 0.7.x and earlier without redownloading the blockchain is not supported.
However, as usual, old wallet versions are still supported.

How to Upgrade
If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` (on Mac)
or `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` (on Linux).
The first time you run version 0.15.0 or newer, your chainstate database will be converted to a
new format, which will take anywhere from a few minutes to half an hour,
depending on the speed of your machine.
Note that the block database format also changed in version 0.8.0 and there is no
automatic upgrade code from before version 0.8 to version 0.15.0 or higher. Upgrading
directly from 0.7.x and earlier without re-downloading the blockchain is not supported.
However, as usual, old wallet versions are still supported.

Denial-of-Service vulnerability CVE-2018-17144
 -------------------------------
A denial-of-service vulnerability exploitable by miners has been discovered in
Bitcoin Core versions 0.14.0 up to 0.16.2. It is recommended to upgrade any of
the vulnerable versions to 0.14.3, 0.15.2 or 0.16.3 as soon as possible.
Known Bugs
Since 0.14.0 the approximate transaction fee shown in Bitcoin-Qt when using coin
control and smart fee estimation does not reflect any change in target from the
smart fee slider. It will only present an approximate fee calculated using the
default target. The fee calculated using the correct target is still applied to
the transaction and shown in the final send confirmation dialog.
0.14.3 Change log
Detailed release notes follow. This overview includes changes that affect
behavior, not code moves, refactors and string updates. For convenience in locating

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP proposal - addrv2 message 
See  for formatted version,
Look under "Considerations" for topics that might still need to be discussed.
  BIP: ???
  Layer: Peer Services
  Title: addrv2 message
  Author: Wladimir J. van der Laan   Comments-Summary: No comments yet.
  Comments-URI:   Status: Draft
  Type: Standards Track
  Created: 2018-06-01
  License: BSD-2-Clause
This document proposes a new P2P message to gossip longer node addresses over the P2P network.
This is required to support new-generation Onion addresses, I2P, and potentially other networks
that have longer endpoint addresses than fit in the 128 bits of the current addr message.
This BIP is licensed under the 2-clause BSD license.
Tor v3 hidden services are part of the stable release of Tor since version 0.3.2.9. They have
various advantages compared to the old hidden services, among which better encryption and privacy
[ Tor Rendezvous Specification - Version 3].
These services have 256 bit addresses and thus do not fit in the existing addr message, which encapsulates onion addresses in OnionCat IPv6 addresses.
Other transport-layer protocols such as I2P have always used longer
addresses. This change would make it possible to gossip such addresses over the
P2P network, so that other peers can connect to them.
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in RFC 2119[ RFC 2119].
The addrv2 message is defined as a message where pchCommand == "addrv2".
It is serialized in the standard encoding for P2P messages.
Its format is similar to the current addr message format
[ Bitcoin Developer Reference: addr message], with the difference that the fixed 16-byte IP address is replaced by a network ID and a variable-length address, and the time and services format has been changed to VARINT.
This means that the message contains a serialized std::vector of the following structure:
{| class="wikitable" style="width: auto; text-align: center; font-size: smaller; table-layout: fixed;"
One message can contain up to 1,000 addresses. Clients SHOULD reject messages with more addresses.
Field addr has a variable length, with a maximum of 32 bytes (256 bits). Clients SHOULD reject
longer addresses.
The list of reserved network IDs is as follows:
{| class="wikitable" style="width: auto; text-align: center; font-size: smaller; table-layout: fixed;"
!Network ID
!Address length (bytes)
To allow for future extensibility, clients MUST ignore address types that they do not know about.
Client MAY store and gossip address formats that they do not know about. Further network ID numbers MUST be reserved in a new BIP document.
Clients SHOULD reject addresses that have a different length than specified in this table for a specific address ID, as these are meaningless.
See the appendices for the address encodings to be used for the various networks.
Send addrv2 messages only, and exclusively, when the peer has a certain protocol version (or higher):
static const int GOSSIP_ADDRV2_VERSION = 70016;
For older peers keep sending the legacy addr message, ignoring addresses with the newly introduced address types.
==Reference implementation==
The reference implementation is available at (to be done)
(to be discussed)
* ''Client MAY store and gossip address formats that they do not know about'': does it ever make sense to gossip addresses outside a certain overlay network? Say, I2P addresses to Tor? I'm not sure. Especially for networks that have no exit nodes as there is no overlap with the globally routed internet at all.
* Lower precision of time field? seconds precision seems overkill, and can even be harmful, there have been attacks that exploited high precision timestamps for mapping the current network topology.
** (gmaxwell) If you care about space time field could be reduced to 16 bits easily.  Turn it into a "time ago seen" quantized to 1 hour precision. (IIRC we quantize times to 2hrs regardless).
* Rolling port into addr, or making the port optional, would make it possible to shave off two bytes for address types that don't have ports (however, all of the currently listed formats have a concept of port.). It could also be an optional data item (see below).
* (gmaxwell) Optional (per-service) data could be useful for various things:
** Node-flavors for striping (signalling which slice of the blocks the node has in selective pruning)
** Payload for is alternative ports for other transports (e.g. UDP ports)
** If we want optional flags. I guess the best thing would just be a byte to include the count of them, then a byte "type" for each one where the type also encodes if the payload is 0/8/16/32 bits. (using the two MSB of the type to encode the length).  And then bound the count of them so that the total is  still reasonably sized.
- Jonas Schnelli: change services field to VARINT, to make the message more compact in the likely case instead of always using 8 bytes.
- Luke-Jr: change time field to VARINT, for post-2038 compatibility.
- Gregory Maxwell: various suggestions regarding extensibility
==Appendix A: Tor v2 address encoding==
The new message introduces a separate network ID for TORV2. Clients MUST send Tor hidden service addresses with this network ID, with the 80-bit hidden service ID in the address field. This is the same as the representation in the legacy addr message, minus the 6 byte prefix of the OnionCat wrapping.
Clients SHOULD ignore OnionCat (fd87:d87e:eb43::/48) addresses on receive if they come with the IPV6 network ID.
==Appendix B: Tor v3 address encoding==
According to the spec [ Tor Rendezvous Specification - Version 3: Encoding onion addresses], next-gen .onion addresses are encoded as follows:
onion_address = base32(PUBKEY | CHECKSUM | VERSION) + ".onion"
 CHECKSUM = H(".onion checksum" | PUBKEY | VERSION)[:2]
 where:
   - PUBKEY is the 32 bytes ed25519 master pubkey of the hidden service.
   - VERSION is an one byte version field (default value '\x03')
   - ".onion checksum" is a constant string
   - CHECKSUM is truncated to two bytes before inserting it in onion_address
Tor v3 addresses MUST be sent with the TORV3 network ID, with the 32-byte PUBKEY part in the address field. As VERSION will always be '\x03' in the case of v3 addresses, this is enough to reconstruct the onion address.
==Appendix C: I2P address encoding==
Like Tor, I2P naming uses a base32-encoded address format[ I2P: Naming and address book].
I2P uses 52 characters (256 bits) to represent the full SHA-256 hash, followed by .b32.i2p.
I2P addresses MUST be sent with the I2P network ID, with the decoded SHA-256 hash as address field.
==Appendix D: Cjdns address encoding==
Cjdns addresses are simply IPv6 addresses in the fc00::/8 range[ Cjdns whitepaper: Pulling It All Together]. They MUST be sent with the CJDNS network ID.

using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.10+, and Windows 7 and newer. It is not
recommended to use Bitcoin Core on unsupported systems.
Bitcoin Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not
as frequently tested on them.
- From 0.17.0 onwards, macOS <10.10 is no longer supported. 0.17.0 is
built using Qt 5.9.x, which doesn't support versions of macOS older than
10.10. Additionally, Bitcoin Core does not yet change appearance when
macOS "dark mode" is activated.
In addition to previously-supported CPU platforms, this release's
pre-compiled distribution also provides binaries for the RISC-V
If you are using the `systemd` unit configuration file located at
`contrib/init/bitcoind.service`, it has been changed to use
`/var/lib/bitcoind` as the data directory instead of
`~bitcoin/.bitcoin`. When switching over to the new configuration file,
please make sure that the filesystem on which `/var/lib/bitcoind` will
exist has enough space (check using `df -h /var/lib/bitcoind`), and
optionally copy over your existing data directory. See the [systemd init
file section]( for more details.

How to Upgrade
If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` (on Mac)
or `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` (on Linux).
Upgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL is
possible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Old
wallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.
Bitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems
using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.12+, and Windows 7 and newer.  Bitcoin
Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as
frequently tested on them.  It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on
unsupported systems.
- From Bitcoin Core 0.20.0 onwards, macOS versions earlier than 10.12 are no
longer supported. Additionally, Bitcoin Core does not yet change appearance
when macOS "dark mode" is activated.
Known Bugs
The process for generating the source code release ("tarball") has changed in an
effort to make it more complete, however, there are a few regressions in
this release:
- - The generated `configure` script is currently missing, and you will need to
  install autotools and run `./autogen.sh` before you can run
  `./configure`. This is the same as when checking out from git.
- - Instead of running `make` simply, you should instead run
  `BITCOIN_GENBUILD_NO_GIT=1 make`.
