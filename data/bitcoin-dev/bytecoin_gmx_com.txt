This may be an appropriate thread to mention that the the "checksum" at the end of an address does not effectively prevent single character errors or transpositions.
For instance   shows that
1ByteCoinAddressesMatch1kpCWNXmHKW 1ByteCoinAddressesMatch1kpCxNXmHKW are both valid addresses even though they only differ by one character.
Similarly, the valid addresses
1ByteCoinAddressesMatchcNN781jjwLY 1ByteCoinAddressesMatchcNN718jjwLY only differ by one transposition.

There was a discussion on  yesterday
I stated that it would be impractical to generate two bitcoin addresses, such that they differed in exactly one character (modulo different checksums).
The corollary to this is that if you find an address with a verifiable signature. Changing one character of that address would have no known private key, and hence be normally undependable.
Does that sound correct?

I'm very pleased that my old idea is getting some traction and that I have been appropriately credited!
I also think the term "reusable addresses" is preferable to anything to do with "stealth" for the reasons mentioned.
You should note that the privacy guarantees they provide are not that strong but their limitations have been adequately discussed elsewhere.
On an unrelated note - I'd like to solicit some help in restoring access to my Bytecoin account on
