?So I'm keeping support for it all while want to be able to provide best
user experience.
Mike, a while ago in ?this thread you've described contactless cards user
experience. I'm also using contactless cards often, and what I'm aiming at
is creating same level of user experience for Bitcoin users.
Encryption over bluetooth is a matter to worry about, and we will introduce
that, but we need to sort out more low level problems first before coming
into that stage.
So, the backwards compatibility is a good issue Michael pointed out.
While processing of multiple "r" parameters is indeed uncertain (since
there is no RFC for that various implementations may behave differently),
the array solution is somewhat better. The array parameter name is "
r%5B1%5D=", i.e. it's not "r=", and we can add plain "r=" alongside. And if
particular implementation understands the array construct - it will use it,
otherwise it will ignore the "r%5B1%5D=" and use only usual "r=".
This doens't work though for cases where particular implementation
understands array construct but doesn't work well with repeating
parameters, since it will see two repeating "r" - an array and a string. I
don't have a solution for that atm.
If add completely new parameter to solve this we will need to make it an
array straight away to address upcoming issues with accommodating other
And then I would also modify existing BIP72 to strictly define "r=" as
"http(s)" ?only ?parameter, while all other protocols (bluetooth, WiFi
Direct, ultrasound, chirp etc) should go to the new array parameter.

Hmm, r1, r2 etc is actually interesting. It takes less chars then array
(yes, array brackets have to be escaped) and provides unlimited number of
options, uniformed approach and priority definition. I'd say that is the
way to go. Any objections?

Ok, agreed. I will submit a pull request to BIP72 then.
Not sure about escaping though. It is indeed not critical for bitcoin URIs,
but still it is a part of RFC, don't think we should go against it.
Andreas, we will implement this on our side, with bluetooth on r= and web
address on r1=.

Hi Lawrence/All
I'm afraid with this BIP for TTP of instant transactions we will end up in
VISA world again. As I see it - it's not about if the TTPs will centralize,
it's only when. Simply because if economy of scales makes growth profitable
and coming into this market is at least a little expensive - this
(centralization, VISA world) will happen, sooner rather than later.
And while some may argue that coming to market in Bitcoin world is cheap so
the crowd will always have a chance to come in and beat the monopolists -
think of one thing. Right now Bitcoin is not seen as money and not
regulated accordingly anywhere in the world, thanks God, but how many years
away we are from the point when it will start to be regulated that way? And
once it is - the monopolies will make sure that rules are restrictive
enough to prevent competition, especially in conjunction with economy of
scales playing against the small newcomers.
The "instant providers list" is susceptible to regulatory influence, and
once in place and widespread - it will be a timebomb under Bitcoin. We need
to solve the doublespend issue without TTP involvement, or at least without
even a slight chance of making this involvement regulateable. Otherwise I
think the Bitcoin experiment will fail.

============================== START ==============================
It took some time but we have finally implemented bluetooth integration
offered by Andreas in our bitcoin payment terminals.
?However it's not ideal at the moment. Basically the main problem is that
in the BIP72 there is no way to provide a fallback alternative URI for
payment request fetch if client wallet supports BIP70 but doesn't not
support fetching over bluetooth or bluetooth connection fails for any
There is a way to define alternative URIs inside payment request itself,
but that doesn't really work as client first needs to get payment request
message itself somehow and this is exactly the problem.
As far as I see there is three ways to solve that:
1. add new URI parameter for bluetooth address
  (e.g. r=
2. allow multiple "r" parameters
  (e.g. r=
3. allow "r" to be an array
  (e.g. r%5B0%5D=
Option  isn't great at all, as it solves existing problem, but not
provides any way to solve same problem appearing again for another possible
Options  &  may be working and seem to be nearly equal, and both are
not great in the way that URI parser behavior in these cases is not clearly
defined. I've checked through relevant RFCs and found nothing specific
about this. According to my limited web experience the array scheme is
working better than multiple repeating parameters.
So I'm looking for some advice on which route of three proposed may be
better here, or if there are any other ways I'm missing.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Instant / contactless payments 
Hi Mike
Not sure if you've seen it, but here is how we do NFC right now
 with XBTerminal.
For now this is just an NDEF URI message with Bitcoin URI inside, and then
transaction itself propagated to the network by the phone using it's own
Internet connection. Far not ideal, but even this is supported only by
Andreas' Wallet, so we cannot move ahead alot really until other wallets
will have some support in this area.
As you see - it's taking just few seconds, most of which is manual payment
confirmation. Btw, ignore my first screen tap, where I'm selecting wallets
- it's an unlikely thing to happen IRL to have several wallets installed at
the same time.
?Also, I think many people may not know about Oyster cards, so this might
need little bit of explanation. And btw, have you been to London lately?
Oyster readers now accept contactless cards directly along with Oyster
cards itself. I wonder if eventually in future we could add bitcoin support
into that system directly, without hardware replacements.
I cannot put much into the actual protocol discussion, but I'm happy to
provide feedback on the side of actual POS implementation needed and
testbase if required.
Have an ?idea - it's a good thing to cap confirmationless payments, but the
actual cap value definition can be tricky considering Bitcoin volatility.
Inless you want to tie it to some external price definition thirdparty
service it could be tied to transaction fees. I mean - if with Bitcoin v0.9
transaction fees will become really floating, and it should eventually
reach equilibrium that will reflect some real world value. Probably a tiny
value, but probably also rather stable value. So confirmationless payment
cap may be defined as x10000.

?Yes, it's part of the? plan. Just again - I need to make sure we support
all major wallets. And no other wallets actually support NFC by now, not
talking about bluetooth. So I imagine we will decide and implement together
some solution here, both on the wallet and POS sides, but I will have to
keep URI method and even QR codes for backwards compatibility, and wait for
other main wallets to accept innovations before we will be able to
completely switch to it.
As I said earlier - bluetooth support for my POS is not a problem, we can
plug it in easily and make it work. Support among all hardware/software and
polished user experience - this is a main thing here really.
 I wonder about the receipt step -- are you generating a PDF on device
?No, I'm generating it on server and sending only URL via NFC. I think this
area will change before we launch in production. Ideally I want ?the device
to be completely autonomous, controlled on site by the merchant, probably
with an app on his phone. But right now we have a backend server that gives
merchant a dashboard with device configuration control, transactions
history, daily reconciliation data and copies of receipts. So the PDF is
sent from that server.
?We should avoid second ?tap ideally, but we need to make sure receipts and
payment proofs are usable and understandable for both payers and payees.
Right now a paperless PDF-only process is already a huge leap ahead
comparing to numerous paper receipts printed for each transaction by
existing POS systems.
Implementing proof of payment based on BIP70 payment request+transaction in
the blockchain+memo will require even bigger shift in the merchant's view
on how business runs. Also it will need additional software on his side to
actually be able to view and confirm these proofs of payment. In theory -
yes, BIP70 will create a way to implement proof of payment. In practice in
real life right now I don't see it viable, it will take time to adopt and
few intermediary steps like PDF based paperless process I've implemented.

It heavily depends on where you use it. Here in UK any card payments are
often limited to minimum of ?5 in small shops that have heavy transaction
fees burden and low margins. Big networks with more resources often let you
pay as little as you want by card, and they more often have NFC enabled POS
So it's not an NFC or POS limit, but a business decision for these small
merchants. Bitcoin can address this issue for sure, but this doesn't
concern NFC.

Hi Andreas
I'm implementing support for BIP70 in my POS at the moment, and I've just
realized that with options you're proposing usecase I'm looking for is not
Right now, before BIP70, I'm sending BIP21 URI via NFC or QR code, and I
need to still be able to use it for backwards compatibility. But at the
same time I want to be able to support BIP70. And also I want to avoid
using external servers, the concept of my POS is that everything is
happening between just payer's phone and payee's POS device. This means
that BIP72 HTTP(S) link inside Bitcoin URI is not suitable for me.
You're also offering an option to include Base43 encoded PR body right
inside the Bitcoin URI, but in a way that is not backwards compatible with
In the end this all means that there is no way for me to at the same time
keep backwards compatibility with all wallets not supporting NFC and BIP70
(all other wallets right now), and keep things inside POS without need for
external servers.
I understand your intention behind base43 encoding and noncompatible URI -
you want to make most possible use of QR codes. But I wonder - did you
compare this base43 to base64 encoded request in a binary QR code format?
How much do we actually win in total bytes capacity at a price of
noncompatibility and increased complexity?
And also maybe we can extend BIP72 to include encoded payment request in
the URL directly in a backwards compatible way?

?I guess this would be best option?. I'm also worried about potential QR
code capacity, since as I imagine we can encounter device that has your
Wallet installed and bluetooth enabled, but no NFC available, so we will
have to operate via onscreen QR codes + bluetooth.
Hmm, if we're inventing an URI for bluetooth, I'd rather follow existing
URI's patterns. BT is strictly point-to-point connection, so BT MAC should
be considered as server address, and payment request ID can be considered
as request path. Probably "bt:/?"
would be more usual and easily understandable.
Really I don't think my PoS will now support multiple simultaneous
payments, but it's good to have this thing in place for the time I will
need it.
I wonder how complex it would be to implement HTTP-over-Bluetooth. Not like
I'm willing to do that now, but HTTP is well known and proven to be quite
good for tasks like this, so in theory it would be handy to have such
capacities in here.
My PoS needs to be compatible with BIP21, as when I'm presenting QR code or
sending NFC message - I have no way to tell what wallet/phone is ??on the
accepting side, so I have to be compatible to existing widely supported
?Well, yes, it would be less efficient than base43. But did you calculate
how much less? ?It's a compatible and already widely used way and loosing
compatibility needs to have serious reasons, so would be great to know
exact figures here.
I can find out base64 size, but I don't have a working base43
implementation (since the only existing is in Java, and I don't speak it).
Can you give me a sample uncompressed PR file of moderate size and a base43
encoded version of it? And I'll convert it into base64 and compare.

I know that general approach to interaction design in Bitcoin assumes
minimal to no difference between payer and payee, and generally I agree
with this approach.
However, for the sake of my PoS development this assumption is wrong by
default, as PoS is a specialized hardware, and one who cared to buy and
install it is probably not in the same situation as the other party that
didn't care to by anything dedicated.
In short - from PoS point of view there is a customer and a merchant. And
my goal is to make thing work in assumption of fast and reliable connection
on merchant side and no connection requirement at all from customer side.
I didn't put a silly example, as of my experience there are really a lot of
places where cellphone connection isn't good enough for reliable Bitcoin
operation. However, if we're talking about merchant establishments - we can
hope for private local WiFi or wired connection on PoS side, so PoS
internet connection shouldn't be an issue. So this is the use case I'm
designing around and this is why bluetooth based BIP70 implementation is
important for me.
I partly agree with Mike on user interface and IOU idea, but I have no
intention to implement anything like that right now.

I had a long discussion recently with somebody who wants and has resources
to do exactly this - paper currency representing bitcoins. Yet we've been
thinking mostly about a centralized solution, where one party is producing
and maintaining paper currency, with bitcoins tied to each note verifiable
via blockchain.
The points we've ended up is that it needs to be:
- reloadable
- NFC based
So anybody can verify any notes instantly by just touching it with his
phone, and so merchants could redeem the notes at the moment of accepting
it, convert it into fully online bitcoins and avoid costs of maintaining
paper money turnover. Probably merchant would sell back redeemed
empty notes to the issuer for a price of the note issue, and issuer will
recharge it and put back into circulation.
One problem we couldn't figure out here though - how to protect the notes
from unauthorized redeem. Like if someone else tries to reach your wallet
with his own NFC - how can we distinguish between deliberate redeem by
owner and fraudulent redeem by anybody else with custom built long
range NFC antenna? Any ideas?

Practically I would approach it from a different angle. We need to make
sure that notes we're accepting are still loaded, but assuming it's NFC
enabled this is still quite easy for the user and is an acceptable
usability drawback.
Then what we need to make sure is that when someone is redeeming the notes
- he has control over physical object itself, ideally for a period of time.
?With some active powered electronics in place it would be easy, but how do
we do it without anything active in place? ?

Asking random ignorant stranger to care to protect themselves never works.
We need solution that requires strictly zero effort.

Hmm, this is firmcoin thing looks like what I mean. They don't have a
solution yet, and prices they quote smartcards are unacceptable, but if
they will manage to get down in selfcost - that may work. Ok, I'll follow
them and see what it will come to.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] DNS seeds unstable 
Hmm, I've mostly setup what's promised, testing DNS seeds now. There is one
problem I see that I can't really solve myself.
This dnsseed daemon cannot serve more than one name at once, which means
that I cannot serve testnet and mainnet seeds off one daemon instance which
means I need to buy two IP addresses for it. That's unfortunate as it needs
much more spendings from me to operate, second IP address will cost nearly
as much as the server itself.
?Can anybody help with this? I cannot into C++ to fix that myself.   ?
Best regards,

Well, it's possible theoretically, but will need another piece of custom
software that will understand DNS protocol and proxy it correctly based on
actual incoming DNS queries.

okay, I've set it up with bind forwarding requests to two dnsseeds running
on separate ports. Though I see a problem with testnet DNS seed itself. It
runs, but somehow it only returns one IP address. Exactly same DNS seeder
looking for mainnet nodes is working fine.
You can reach seeds through
mainnet seed:
dig  bitcoin-seed.alexykot.me A
or directly
dig -p 8353  bitcoin-seed.alexykot.me A
testnet seed
dig  testnet-seed.alexykot.me A
or directly
dig -p 18353  testnet-seed.alexykot.me A
So what can be the problem with testnet DNS seeder?

Misunderstanding. Both seeds are available on port 53 via BIND forwarding.
Just also each DNS seed is available separately on it's own port.

Hi Peter
I've setup DNS seeds myself a week ago, at testnet-seed.alexykot.me and
bitcoin-seed.alexykot.me, but there is a problem with DNS settings that we
with Andreas couldn't sort out quickly.
The problem itself is that I can reach my nameserver and get dnsseed
response if I query it directly with
dig  testnet-seed.alexykot.me
dig  bitcoin-seed.alexykot.me
?But when I try nslookup testnet-seed.alexykot.me? - it fails.
I guess the problem is in my DNS settings but I can't figure out what is it.
o could you share
?how you configured
? for your seed
to help me debug
Best regards,

Hmm, you might be right, as queries
dig  testnet-seed.alexykot.me
dig  -p 18353 testnet-seed.alexykot.me?
?are giving different authority sections.
Hmm, but if I setup custom SOA record for it - it should work, right?
What SOA name should it be actually, assuming that NS record for
testnet-seed.alexykot.me is pointing at alexykot.me?
