I guess the assumption here is a full-block scenario where users of LN would be
willing to pay 100 times the fees users of crude transactions would be willing
to pay for the same limited space in the blockchain, simply because LN would
group 100 real world payments into 1 crude transaction.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Bitcoin Node Speed Test 
Thank you a lot for doing this test!
Two questions:
1) A node is typically connected to many nodes that would all in parallel
download said block. In your test you measured how fast new blocks that
presumably are being uploaded in parallel to all those other nodes are being
uploaded? Or did you download blocks while those nodes were basically idle?
2) What is your percentage of the very slow connections?

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Committed bloom filters for improved wallet 
gmaxwell just made me aware of this mail thread [0]. Some days ago I had
independently and naively started implementing "something similar" [1].
My version totally ignored the commitment and signing part but I'm pretty sure
that 12GB is overkill. My code is currently broken and I have no time to work on
it much but I thought it might be helpful to chime in.
At this point in time the difference between 80GB and 3GB (as my current 1.5GB
of only outputs would suggest if I had covered the inputs) or even 12GB makes
the difference of being able to store it on a phone, vs. not being able to. 80GB
"compressed" to 3GB is not that bad at all. Unfortunately, with segWit this will
be worse, with the higher transaction count per MB.

The really great benefit of having this index is that you could implement rather
efficient cold wallet spending once the wallet has the full index.
With Mycelium you can currently spend funds from a paper wallet or a BIP39
sentence but at the cost of sharing all addresses with our servers. Schildbach
would share addresses with random full nodes for hours or days to find funds of
a new private key with unknown creation date. With CBF it would still be a
matter of maybe minutes on a phone to identify relevant blocks and download
these but it would be very feasible to implement a private, cold storage
spending feature.
Also the index could be further partitioned by P2PKH, P2PK, P2SH, ? This would
lead to a very minor privacy leak for a reasonable reduction in index size.

As established above, there will emerge a market to lock coins, so these locks
will be readily available without having to buy them. Even with V^2 there is no
reason to amass more coins beyond a certain point. Running the biggest 5 V^2
scores should be pretty solid to get in on many coin joins.
Requiring the bond to reside on a hot wallet would be a massive disadvantage.
No matter how you look at the whole problem of sibyl attacks, the honest maker
will have operational costs and gain fees and the sibyl attacker will have the
same plus profit from the deanonymization. As long as makers hunt marginal
profits, the sibyl attacker having the higher margin from deanonymization will
always win. The fidelity bonds would make this even worse, as increased
complexity and entry cost would not favor more makers but less even before the
centralization incentive mentioned above (V^2). To say that old holders have
bitcoins laying around that they can use for such bonds is a fallacy as they
could just as well rent them out on a bonds market.
How about turning this upside down and shift the incentives from being taker to
being maker by introducing a mandatory fee? If each join costs 1% per maker,
people would initially gasp and reject to update to that version but those who
do, will do to become makers, increasing the maker count massively and
eventually most people in frequent need of joining will also become makers to
offset the costs of being takers.
With these changed rules again the sibyl attackers would still have their
competitive edge and would flood the market with even more cheap offers but now
everybody would have an incentive to do the same and as makers have to have the
UTXOs, it's not free to sibyl attack already.

To show how this argument is wrong, think about the market being split between
100 makers, each making 1% of the fees. By your argument, by colluding, they
could make far more than 100% of the fees.
Every cartel of makers pooling their bonds beating the odds can't be the goal.
And again, bonds are just a cost of business. If a $10/month in bonds (paid to a
guy to sign with his UTXOs or interest for BTCs lent or ...) leaves me with zero
fees, a $100/month with $1k in fees and $10k/month with $40k in fees, then there
might be a $1000/month barrier to entry for this market but there are enough
people with $10k available to enter the market and drive the fees (earned per
maker) down such that the barrier to entry increases even further. In the end,
only the holders of the 20 biggest bonds will get meaningful business and the
rest will lose their investment or just not bother being makers. And the sibyl
attackers again are the ones that put up the necessary funds with most ease of
them all.
