Hi All,
I put together a draft describing an idea I had for an alternate set of chain mechanics which solve some of the problems I see with existing proof-of-work and proof-of-stake systems (mining centralization, wealth concentration, nothing-at-stake, lack of full-node incentives, etc.). I'd love to get feedback on the idea.
