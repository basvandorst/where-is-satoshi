If this means essentially that a soft fork deployment of SegWit will require SPV wallet servers to change their logic (or risk not being able to send payments) then it does seem to me that a hard fork to deploy this non controversial change is not only cleaner (on the data structure side) but safer in terms of the potential to affect the user experience.?

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Generalized soft forks 
Please forgive the perhaps pedantic question but in the referred document
It talks about how a soft fork with >50% support will doom the other fork to being orphaned eventually but that hard forks could persist forever.  I fail to see why the same logic that one side having the majority will eventually win wouldn't also apply to hard forks.  Additionally it seems to me that a notable difference between a generalized soft fork as described and a hard fork majority is in the process by which they force the other fork to be orphaned. In a hard fork an unupgraded node would know you were in a forking situation due to your node getting a lot of blocks from the other fork and having to reject them (because they are invalid) whereas in a generalized soft fork you wouldn't know there was a fork going on so there would be less of an impetus to upgrade.  Of course the downside of the hard fork is that the losing side would potentially lose money in the orphaned chain, but presumably this discussion of generalized soft forks is with regards to non-mining nodes so it shouldn't come into consideration. In fact if an non-upgraded miner were to start mining on top of that block which they cannot actually fully validate essentially this condones mining without verification (and trusting that others which have upgraded nodes to have validated the txns for you) as this situation can continue for a prolonged period of time does this not hurt network security ?

The UTXO sets may diverge but they actually will be strict subsets/supersets of each other as no transaction would be invalid on one fork vs another unless the hard fork lasts longer than 100 blocks. This is of course specific to a block limit change hard fork.

Well I'd like to think that with an economy all parts of it interact with each other in ways more complex than simplistic imperative logic.?
I agree that the economic majority is essentially what matters in a hard fork but everyone (miners,devs,public thought leaders,businesses) is part of that economy. Additionally what miners signal as their intention affects the decision of that economic majority (and vice versa). ?You can see the effects of this in traditional political processes in how preliminary vote polling results affect (reinforce) the final vote.?
We also can see the results of this in (dare I mention) the whole XT affair which had the signed intent of many of the economy (payment processors and wallets and one miner pool) and the rest of the miners did not go along with it. This experiment either means that the rest of the miners couldn't be bothered to signal at all (because they didn't know how) or they were affected by the influence of core devs or the opinions of others on the matter and rejected the economic majority. ?(Which would imply core devs have some power by way of indirect influence) I would be inclined to believe the latter was more likely.?
The conclusion which this would seem to imply is that at the very least, miners matter (to what exact extent is debatable). ?And although there is no direct control of any party over the other in the strict sense, the public vocal opinions of any part of the Bitcoin economy does have an effect in its ability to sway the opinions of the other parts.?

Because Bitcoin XT is 1.0.0
---------- Forwarded message ----------
I guess the question then becomes why bitcoin still is <1.0.0
I'd say it's safe to say that it's used in production.

Thanks for that great breakdown Anthony. I think it helps a lot of us get a better handle on the matter without getting too technical.?
A couple of questions on some of the points you made I'd like to put out there:
First I think your unsaid assumption about the fragility of a soft fork showing incorrect confirmations is dependent on the percentage of hash power that didn't upgrade. ?If using your same numbers this was only 5% of the hash power, the attack is effectively not effective (u less the attacker knew an exact merchant that was unfortunately on the minority of the network.?

Thanks AJ,
That is a must more concise example, which I think makes it very clear all the variables at play.?
I agree with its conclusion.?
Though I'm wondering about its actual significance in ability to do harm as with 5% hash power we would have to wait quite a long time before such a block was created and it would be unpredictable when exactly this would occur, and in order to actually execute such a double spend maliciously you would have to 1) notice that such a block was mined and 2) be in a position to double spend a payment with a merchant for physical goods who you would know was using an SPV wallet at that exact time, correct? (By deliberately publishing a txn which would be blocked by the upgraded network)
Isn't that in itself unlikely enough to make this form of double spend unlikely to be exploitable?
Perhaps with malicious wallet software which always publishes "bad" (will be mostly rejected) txn first and then retries with a normal one?
But I agree with you that if the risk is there why not avoid it if possible. ?
