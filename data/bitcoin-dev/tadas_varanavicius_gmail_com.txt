@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Release candidates: versions 0.4.1 and 0.5 
newbie here, thanks for patience.
I start 0.5.0 without wallet.dat. It creates 100 new keys. I then encrypt them. It should be now bug free and totally secure, so I back the wallet up. I then click "new address", it doesn't use the old 2-100 addresses, instead generates a new batch, because it assumes the old ones are leaked, but in fact they are not. I receive funds to my new 2nd address (which is now not backed up). I lose the new wallet. Restore from backup. Bitcoins lost forever?
Sorry if false alarm, thanks.

Let's assume bitcoin has scaled up to 2000 tx/s. We all want this, right?  Block size is 500 MB. CPU, network and archival blockchain storage seem to solvable.
Let's say SatoshiDice-like systems are doing informational transactions that produce unspendable outputs, because they can and users are paying for it anyway (proved in real life). 400 unspendable outputs per second would be realistic.
This would be bloating UTXO data at a speed of 52 GB/year. That's a very big memory leak. And this is just the unspendable outputs.
Bitcoin cannot scale up until such dust output spamming is discouraged at the protocol level.

Isn't there danger of an attack if UTXO is not stored in fast storage?

I'm thinking that (assuming 2000 tx/s and UTXO growing 50 GB/year) a malicious miner could create 1 GB of unspent outputs and then spam nodes with valid transactions. This would not be dangerous, if UTXO were smaller and fit on RAM.
Thank you for reading and correcting me :)
