@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Determine input addresses of a transaction 
PKI would avoid the need for the trust aggregator to be consulted for each transaction. Obviously checking for revocation would be essential. The CA cert can state what kind of guarantee is available.

separate filterinit / filterload - so you can do a new filterload later on if your list changes, without the privacy implications of filteradd.

============================== START ==============================
And then the problem of what domain name to use - ideally a single name would be used so caches had the maximum chance to reuse content. To keep the network distributed perhaps the existing DNS seed mechanism could be used - a few names, each serving a random bitcoind's address. Put :8333 after the name, and enhance bitcoind to respond to HTTP and p2p caching would be used!

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] bitcoin taint & unilateral revocability 
Take a look at this privacy enhancing solution based on fair exchange implemented by bitcoin contracts and cut-and-choose. It would require a public pool of users willing to exchange in common denominations at moments in time together to ensure unlinkability. It also leave a trace of exchange activity in the chain. This could all be added to wallet software to become automatic.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Double-spending unconfirmed transactions 
Miners earn bitcoins, and clearly a network where reasonable certainty can be achieved with 0-confirm transactions is more useful, thus will result in those bitcoins being more valuable. One would expect rational miners (or pool operators) to want to collaborate to reduce the possibilities for double spend attacks as much as possible.
