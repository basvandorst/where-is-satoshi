@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP proposal: Elliptic SSS scheme 
Hi everyone!
Would like to propose the solution for sharing the private key / other
sensitive information with a modified SSS scheme.
The key features are:
1) the secret restoration is not possible without corresponding signatures
2) share[i] belongs to privateKey[i] only, which means it can't be signed
with a different private key
I hope this approach can help on the application level to share sensitive
information or it can be used as m-of-n multi-signature (this is
discussable). I've attached the pdf file with the concept description. Also
here is the repo with a working example in node.js:
Thanks in advance for your time.
