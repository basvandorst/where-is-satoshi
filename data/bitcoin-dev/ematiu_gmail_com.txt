@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] New BIP32 structure 
They replied this on reddit: "Good question! We use 256-bit BIP39
seeds for our 512-bit extended HD wallet keypairs, as advised by
BIP32. We are aware that 128 is considered ok in Electrum but we
wanted to follow BIP32 spec, in particular because we are working with
hardware wallets that have been design with BIP32 in mind and wanted
to avoid any incompatibility issue."
BTW, thanks for starting this thread. I am with the bitcore team,
working on a new multisig only wallet (Cosign).
The schema originally proposed be Mike (/m/cointype/reserved'/account'/change/n
) seems flexible enough for our needs. I wonder, tough, if we can
agree also on a format to exchange the tips (n) of each branch on the
tree when the user export/backup the wallet, as  Allen suggested.

Is the ideal schema that the user should be able to use two different
wallets at the same time? Does a wallet need to assume that derivate
keys could had been used already? That seems complicated. Maybe we
could add a  /(hash of the wallet name)/ on the BIP32 path.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] moving the default display to mbtc 
I live in Argentina. Here, 1BTC is around half of a monthly average
wage (net), so, as you
can imagine, the value of 1 BTC is *very* inconvenient  for everyday
 Also it presents an important entry barrier for new adopters: It would be
easier to accept buying thousands of "bits" than buying a tiny fraction
of a Bitcoin, for the same amount of pesos.
Changing to 1e-6 "bits" will solve both problems. Changing to 1e-6
"microbitcoins" will
solve the first one, but not sure about the second one. Buying (or
earning) mili or micro
something  isn't that sexy either.
Finally, against "micro" and in favor of "bits", micro is noted "?",
which is also
 inconvenient (I had to copy and paste it from an other site). Many
different notations will be used like:  ?BTC, uBTC,  "microBTC" and
even "mBTC".
Please prevent that.
These arguments also applies to many places in the  world (Argentina
is 40 out of 72 listed countries in

Hi Sumit,
Take a look at  it is a
bitcoin indexing API server, with several modules, like a block explorer, a
wallet module, etc. It is built using Node.js.
