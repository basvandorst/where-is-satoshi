Why not just using SI prefixes, as God intended.
MBTC mega 10^6 kBTC kilo 10^3
-    -    10^0
mBTC milli 10^-3 uBTC micro 10^-6
nBTC nano  10^-9 (at all possible?)

I really don't. Just use the SI prefixes.
The display units should be choosable by the user. Why on earth?
The reason SI prefixes were invented is exactly to preven that case.

Alex, you're top-posting and not trimming your replies.
Yes, people really can't tell any difference between
mm, cm, m, dm and km. Not.
You're trying to invent a new symbol for the same unit, instead
of using an established, generic system of prefixes.
That's pretty insane.
I would prefer that nobody does any such silly thing. Bitcoin is not measured in bits. Bits are units of information, and
are measured in bits, kbits, Mbits, Gbits, Tbits, Pbits etc.
What would a sane person think if he saw that on the roadmap, you think?
Ever heard of SI unit prefixes?

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] please check my debug.log 
I've put up some bitcoind nodes after the network is
in need of some, and would like some feedback in that
the nodes are fully operational and doing something
useful. Please check the logs and tell me whether
I'm doing good.

Anything involving lots of unpredictable memory accesses to a large
chunk of fast memory is unASICable. That data vector could be derived
by the same means as an one time pad, and loaded and locked into
memory after boot. If you make it large enough it won't profit from
embedded RAM bandwidth/speedup. The only way to speed up would be clustering,
which doesn't offer economies of scale.
