@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] A DNS-like decentralized mapping for wallet 
The original altcoin, Namecoin, aimed a building a bitcoin-like, blockchain
based decentralized DNS system. Unfortunately it didn't catch, but it would
be the most logical choice for the name registry database.

transaction, thus, valid no matter who is spending. So, you would be
basically leaving the security of segwit transactions to those who actually
are interested in and using them. If your fork becomes popular, it would
decrease the security of Segwit transactions to something akin to the
security model of the Drivechain currently being discussed: only those
particularly interested in that particular sidechain (and segwit witness
could be loosely categorized into a sidechain) will be responsible to
prevent others from stealing funds from the anyone-can-spend transactions.

2017-07-21 16:28 GMT-03:00 Major Kusanagi via bitcoin-dev <
bitcoin-dev at lists.linuxfoundation.org>:
Unless there is a logical contradiction in this phrasing, the proposed
solution does not improves scalability:
 - "Bitcoins lasting forever" implies "unscalable";
 - "not prevent Bitcoin from lasting forever" implies "Bitcoins lasting
 - Thus: "not prevent Bitcoin from lasting forever" implies "unscalable".
In practice, the only Bitcoin lost would be those whose owners forgot about
or has lost the keys, because everyone with a significant amount of
Bitcoins would always shift them around before it loses any luster (I
wouldn't bother to move my Bitcoins every 10 years). I don't know how to
estimate the percentage of UTXO is actually lost/forgotten, but I have the
opinion it isn't worth the hassle.
As a side note, your estimate talks about block size, which is determines
blockchain size, which can be "safely" pruned (if you are not considering
new nodes might want to join the network, in case the full history is
needed to be stored somewhere). But UTXO size, albeit related to the full
blockchain size, is the part that currently can not be safely pruned, so I
don't see the relevance of the analysis.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Freeze Bitcoin protocol and call it Bitcoin 1 
Is it too late to propose to freeze Bitcoin protocol as it is today (no
SegWit, no bigger block)?
Hear me out: assume Bitcoin is frozen as it is now: no more forks, no more
change in consensus rules. Call it Bitcoin 1 (BC1). So, how to evolve and
scale Bitcoin?
Use a very conservative sidechain, call it Bitcoin 2 (BC2), tightly
coupled, block per block, with Bitcoin 1 chain. No fancy experimental
changes there: fix the bare minimum to support more general two-way
sidechains, linear scalability transaction verification time and
transaction malleability. Can be one way only if that makes it simple
enough: coins sent to BC2 can never come back to BC1.
Miners choose to mine a BC2 block alongside a BC1 block, and it can be done
for free once a BC1 block is found. There may be BC1 blocks in the chain
whose corresponding BC2 blocks are missing (and that is not a big deal),
but there will be an economic incentive to mine a BC2 block, since
transaction fees on that chain will be collected.
The economic adoption is completely voluntary and independent of anyone
else, doesn't require the strong consensus of SegWit. If it is feasible to
create a simple enough two way sidechain over BC1, good. If not, economic
value of BC1 will always be at least that of BC2, but never lower. BC2 may
have a lower price than BC1 at first, but since it will have every feature
of BC1, plus the possibility of massive scalability and instantaneous
transactions with a lightning network built over BC2 (a practical
economical advantage), it will most likely value over what BC1 could ever
be alone, raising BC1 price with it.
If these predictions are correct, fewer and fewer people will transact BC1,
eventually with blocks mined empty except for the coinbase, which the miner
may choose to send directly to BC2. If I turn out to be wrong, and people
prefer to stick to the old BC1 for some reason, BC2 becomes just another
speculative altcoin. Thus, everyone migrating should be fully conscious
about the risk of immediate devaluation.
The 2 major risks I see that could hamper the adoption are:
 - Just plain fear: I find the whole economical incentive scenario of BC2
sound and plausible, just as I found Bitcoin sound and plausible when I
heard about it for the first time. I also fear to put my money in BC2, just
as I did when I heard about Bitcoin. BC2 case is even worse, because I can
safely hold my coins in BC1 until I am sure BC2 is solid, so at first we
may experience only enthusiast adoption;
- Technological inertia: everyone wishing to accept BC2 will have to
implement this payment system as for any other altcoin. Every exchange
supporting both will have to create separated markets for BC1 and BC2.
Remember: both chains must be obviously distinguishable. It is even
desirable that the address format in BC2 to be incompatible with BC1 (maybe
staring with "2" ?).
Finally, due to the present state of affairs, with impending activation of
segwit with a promise to hardfork in 3 months, I believe this proposal is
too late, not to mention the stress, emotions and hard feelings of the
situation will make it go largely ill received or ignored. But since I
genuinely believe this to be the best and most conservative way to go with
Bitcoin, I wrote this anyway.
Please forgive me if something like this was discussed a thousand times
before and you wasted your time reading this.

I understand the first-mover disadvantages, but I keep thinking that if the
new chain is Pareto optimal, i.e. is in all aspects at least good as the
original chain, but in some so much better to justify the change, the
initial resistance is an unstable equilibrium. Like a herd of buffaloes
attacking a lion: the first buffalo to attack is in awful disadvantage, but
if a critical mass of the herd follows, the movement succeeds beyond
turning back, and every buffalo benefited, both those who attacked the lion
and those that didn't (because the lion was chased away or killed).

If you have to change Bitcoin to recognize a transfer from the sidechain
back into Bitcoin, you kill the purpose of the sidechain. You could as well
just change the Bitcoin to implement whatever desirable features the
sidechain would have. The whole idea of sidechains is to keep Bicoin
unchangend, and allow for the voluntary transfer of tokens out of Bitcoin
to the sidechain of your choosing.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Horizontal scaling of blockchain 
If I understood correctly, OP was not talking about the process inside a
node being single threaded, but instead that the whole bitcoin distributed
system behaves as single threaded computation. OP seems to be describing a
system closer to what IOTA uses, by distributing among the miners the task
of validating the transactions. Although, without more specific details, it
is hard to judge the benefits.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Built in encryption 
Theoretically, if the recipient address had already disclosed the
public key (i.e. already spent from that address), or shared it with
you instead of (or alongside with) the address, then you can use
recipient's ECDSA key to encrypt the message with ECC, as both ECDSA
and ECC share the same kind of public/private key pair, according to
the this link: In practice, I am not sure the nodes would broadcast such non-standard
transaction (but it can be mined, nonetheless).

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Proposal: rewarding fees to next block miner 
If the miner wants to force fees up, why would he fill up a block with
placeholder high fee transactions, instead of simply cutting off
transactions paying less fee than he is willing to take? Is there any
evidence someone is doing such a thing for whatever reason?
