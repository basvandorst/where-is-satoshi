I posted this to /r/BitcoinMarkets but I thought I might post it here as
Currently 0 mined blocks have voted for XT.
If it ever gets close to even 50%, many things can happen that would
reshape the game completely.
For instance:
- Core could start boycotting XT by not relying to them and/or not relying
from them.
- Core could appropriate the version string of XT, making it impossible to
know how much they are progressing and a losing bet to actually execute the
This kind of node war if the factions were sizeable would make it very
risky to transact at all - balances in new addresses could end up
vanishing. Usability of the system would plummet.
Note that any disagreement between the network and the biggest economic
actors - mainly the exchanges at this point, "wallet services" maybe -
would mean BTC plummets. Hard. And so would confidence.
It's a risky game to play.
PS: I consider this attempt at takeover about as foul as it gets. The
equivalent of repeating a referendum until a yes is obtained: the
reasonable reaction to this is actively blocking said "referendum". There
was a fair play alternative which is voting through coinbase scriptSig like
plain 8MBers are doing, or like BIP 100 proposes for dynamic adjustment.
Once a majority is obtained in this way, devs have to react or if they
don't then this sort of foul play would be justified. But this wasn't the

If someone is surprised with Mike Hearn's antics, I recommend taking a few
minutes to watch this video from 2 months ago:

If this was in place I would contribute more and I wouldn't have to create
throw-away accounts.
This is not a space where you want to be a recognisable target.
Today, BitFury's CEO threatened to sue developers if they didn't kowtow to
his demands to leave the PoW alone. This is unacceptable. Decisions have to
be made on merit and the interest of the project, and nothing else.
This is very important and needs to be given priority. Most Core developers
and all the main ones except Satoshi have built a public persona, either
for ego or for practical monetary reasons. Obviously there's academia where
everything is about plastering your name as much as possible and getting
cited. So it's understood. Although I understand the difficulty of getting
funded and getting trusted without a face, there needs to be an outlet so
people can interact and contribute in a proper cypherpunk way.
Also, GitHub is quite anti-privacy. So I recommend not reusing personal
accounts from work.
