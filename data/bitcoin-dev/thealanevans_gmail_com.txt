============================== START ==============================
you can use with any bip39 wallet sounds perfectly reasonable.
I think any method that doesn't use real entropy, but some fake source of
randomness, such as a book is asking to be hacked and so is not a
reasonable idea.
If an algorithm for book text to BIP39 sentence ever became well used,
common books will be systematically searched for accounts. People will also
choose their favourite passages, so I would expect to see collisions.
You should also note that BIP39 does not need input that is from the word
list. You can use *any text as its input*, the word list and checksum check
is just recommended to be a warning, but again, text chosen from public
sources or common phrases is a bad idea for many reasons.
*> The conversion of the mnemonic sentence to a binary seed is completely
independent from generating the sentence. This results in rather simple
code; there are no constraints on sentence structure and clients are free
to implement their own wordlists or even whole sentence generators,
allowing for flexibility in wordlists for typo detection or other purposes.*
*> Although using a mnemonic not generated by the algorithm described in
"Generating the mnemonic" section is possible, this is not advised and
software must compute a checksum for the mnemonic sentence using a wordlist
and issue a warning if it is invalid.*
What you could do is use a regular true random BIP39 sentence in
conjunction with a phrase from a book as the "passphrase" giving you that
plausible deniability, right up to the point you put that in your will or
tell someone, i.e. for the "what if something happens to me" case. Though I
still think redirecting people to a book phase is risky for this, e.g.
books have editions, there may be a change in the key place.
*> The described method also provides plausible deniability, because every
passphrase generates a valid seed (and thus a deterministic wallet) but
only the correct one will make the desired wallet available.*
P.S. "I have seen many people completely lost with their wallets because of
[BIP39]": I would say "despite" not "because". These people would have
lost/miss recorded a BIP32 hex seed as well.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Suggestion to remove word from BIP39 English 
third party
1. The same words are used for wallets of all kinds of coins, so it's not
obvious it's for bitcoin.
2. Anyone recognising the word "satoshi" as related to cryptocurrency in
general, would also recognise any mnemonic.
3. You could elect to skip a mnemonic that includes the word if it was a
personal concern (but I would discourage selecting a mnemonic base on
personal preference, as could get dangerously close to being a brain wallet
in effect).
4. You could choose to record just the first 4 characters of each word,
"sato" is enough.
5. Where do we stop? the words "coin", "cash", "rich" are in there too.
6. About automated data-recovery, if you are storing mnemonics on HDDs or
other digial media, then you have larger security concerns than it just
being found during HDD recycling.
But most of all:
7. Removing a word or changing a list *is impossible* as verification of an
existing mnemonic requires the list. To change one word, you would need to
provide an alternative to BIP0039 to cope with alternative words, or change
all the words to a completely new set of 2048 English words so that it is
clear which wordlist is in use.

alternative word will represent the same number on the list
That convention would be the alternative to BIP0039 I am referring to.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP Proposal: Revised: UTPFOTIB - Use Transaction 
I don't see any modifications to the proposal that addresses the issue that
miners will always be free to choose their own priority that a few people
brought up before.
I understand you think it's in the miners best long-term interest to follow
these rules, but even if a miner agrees with you, if that miner thinks the
other miners are following the fee curve, they will know it makes no
overall difference if they cheat (you can't prove how long a miner has had
a transaction in their mempool).
The opportunity to cheat, the anonymity of mining, the low negative effect
of a single cheating instance, all combined with a financial incentive to
cheat means that cheating will be rife.

safe to send to him
If you spent your change from transaction A, that would be safe. There'd be
no way you John could end up with 2 BTC from you then.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Transaction Merging (bip125 relaxation) 
So, OP, in your scenario, you have 1 transaction in the mempool, A, then
you want to spend the change before confirmation, so you broadcast a new
transaction, B, which replaces A.
transactions, unless there is a considerable feerate bump, this rule isn't
possible to observe.
I'm confused, the mempool only sees 1 transaction at a time, first A, then
later B. " the original transactions", plural, should not exist in the
B's fee and rate needs to be larger than A's, but B will be greater than or
equal to A anyway. So, just increasing the fee rate will cause a larger fee
Am I missing something?

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Card Shuffle To Bitcoin Seed 
It's not quite enough to just do SHA512, you missed out this condition
(incredibly rare as it is):
Also I can't see how I would use this to seed a hardware wallet that
requires a BIP39 seed as mentioned in your abstract.
For both of those reasons, you may want to just invent/formalize a scheme
that takes Cards -> Entropy.
continue, generate and store their root xprv.
Prior art: Note that Ian Coleman's BIP39 site already supports Cards (and
Dice), see the logic here:
[image: image.png]
Note it detected "full deck". It also calculates the Total Bits of Entropy
and can handle card replacement and multiple decks.
PS, you're a bit out on your entropy calculation, log2(52!) ~= 225.58 bits,
not 219.
