@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Cold Signing Payment Requests 
We do automatic refunds. When bitcoins arrive after an offer has expired
(which happens quite often with webwallets that don't broadcast
transactions immediately), we return all the bitcoins to a specified
bitcoin-address. This happens a couple of times per day and can amount
to a couple of hundred bitcoins per offer.

On the contrary, we would prefer to broadcast the transaction ourselves.

We have BIP70 already in use (over a hundred paid requests).
Could you elaborate on why this needs changing?
