@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Blockchain Voluntary Fork (Split) Proposal 
Here I propose a simple method to solve the scalability issue of blockchain.
It is more like a financial trick rather than a technical solution.
The technical part is very simple:
Split ( hard fork ) the blockchain into two or more blockchains (e.g. two
blockchain A and B), voluntarily.
The two blockchains are the same except for some identifiers to distinguish
the two blockchains.
The coins on one blockchains cannot be sent to the other one or interfered
by the other blockchain (  considering so many hard forks in the last year,
the replay protection should work in this situation)
Everyone get double bitcoins. Each has half  value of original one bitcoin.
Then, we have two almost same blockchains and the capacity of the original
blockchain is doubled theoretically.
When sending coin, the wallet should select one blockchain randomly and try
to send through only  one blockchain (If there is enough bitcoins)
I think it is a  possible solution, if the community realize  no previously
owned asset value  is lost.
The method is inspired by the stock split
When a stock share is split, for example into two shares, the price halves.
The market capitalization remains the same.
There is no dilution of every shareholders' total assets.
The bitcoin often emphasizes that the total coin supply should not be
If the total supply increases, the value of a single coin will be diluted.
That is true.
However, the bad part of inflation of fiat money is not  diluted value of
every unit of fiat money caused by total supply increase.
The problem is the increased supply is not delivered to everyone
proportional to their previously owned money.
The increased supply is released through debt expansion.
The people that can borrow more money with low interest ratio (during QE,
it was nearly 0) can invest  and get profit.
Or they don't even need to pay back the debt. The debt is left to
government, which might never pay back the debt, and some  get more money
from government.
Others' money are diluted.
With voluntary split of bitcoin, dilution of anyone's bitcoin assets won't

Hi ZmnSCPxj
I dont think they need to be ENFORCED to be worth the same.
If the two chains? algorithms are the same , except some identifiers (eg.
btc.0 btc.1?, they have no reason to have different value. If so, the
market will adjust the value.
Also, the total supply can be the same. The amount in blockchains  is just
some numbers. The  wallet can display correct amount, according to the
The voluntary split is also backward compatible with old version
transactions, they can be treated as tx for both chains and included in
both chains later. For new version Tx after fork, some identifiers must be
added , to mark the tx is for that chain only. The miners need to choose
one chain to mine.
After several voluntary splits , the Blockchain basically become a
blocktree, new blocks are added to the leaves(eg. btc.00 btc.01 btc.10
btc.11 ), providing even more capacity.

Miners are most likely to be  equally distributed between the two almost
same chains.
If one chain is faster, according to the difficulty adjustment scheme, it
will become more difficult to mine.
The two chain should have similar chain generation rates with similar
difficulty and similar length.
or the miners will be attracted to the chain easier to mine,
and more miners will make the chain generation rate increase and then,
after difficulty adjustment, harder to mine.
Equilibrium will be achieved.
All the above are based on one assumption: the two chains have the same
value initially or miners believe they will  have  the same value finally.

The human perception of difference will be eliminated.
Will your bank tell you whether your balance means coins or paper money?
If wallets and exchanges only show the total amount of btc rather than
btc.0 and btc.1, there is no human perception difference.
Also note that one valid address is automatically valid on the other chain,
which means you can send money through any one chain. As long as one has
the private key, he/she can get the money anyway. So there is no difference
between number of merchants. The merchant ?s address is valid on both
The exchange cost would be trivial. People don?t need to exchange two same

Hi ZmnSCPxj,
coins each with "1 Dollar" on it?
with "10 Dollar" on it for 10 coins with "1 Dollar" on it, because by
government fiat, such an exchange is valid for all cases.
This is a good question. Does anyone think about why the bitcoins generated
from different blocks have the same value? Some of them are still
distinguishable ( if they are not combined with others sent out).  Would
the bitcoins that can be traced back to the block where it was generated
be worth different from others ?   If one day Satoshi released
his/her/their bitcoins  , would the bitcoins from the first several blocks
mined by Satoshi be worth more?
I think for fungibility, it is not like either it has fungibility or it has
no fungibility. There should be a value of fungibility (e.g. from 0 to 1)
that can be measured or evaluated.
