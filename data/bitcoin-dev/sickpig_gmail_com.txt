many many thanks Krzysztof.
This was badly needed.
This is a way to get more people to understand
the whole system, hence increasing the number
of bitcoin devs on the long term.

fair objection, fwiw.
at the end of the day it's opensource so it could always be improved via pull
request on github.
Krzysztof, in that regard I would add a licence file to make
integration of changes
made by others smoother.
just out of curiosity, do you think it will be possible to create any
other proper
protocol specifications rather than the C++  original?

isn't SegWit gain ~75%? hence 2mb x 1.75 = 3.5.
4x is theoric gain you get in case of 2-2 multisig txs.
am I missign something obvious?

many thanks for the explanation.
so it should be fair to say that BIP 102 + SW would bring a gain between
2*1.6 and 2*2.
Just for the sake of simplicity if we take the middle of the interval we
could say
that BIP102 + SW will bring us a max block (virtual) size equal to 1MB * 2
* 1.8 = 3.6
Is it right?

So hypothetically if wallets/payments processors/full nodes adoption
will take 6 month to get to 50% after the segwit soft-fork activation, this
means that actual network capacity will be increased by:
1.75 x 0.5 + 1 x 0.5 = 1.375
after six month.
An hard-fork on the others side would bring 1.75 since the activation, am I

Hi Raystonn
I don't know if he or someone else has begun writing code to implement
what was described in the liked post, but I'm sure he will reply to
you since he's subscribed to this mailing list.

Hi Peter,

just a minor nit pick, you should update "References" links using the new
mailing list archive.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Fwd: [bitcoin-core-dev] On the initial notice of 
guess that the fact you don't understand it, it's probably related to the fact
that you didn't read properly the tweet you are referring to, for reference this
the tweet URL This is the text of such a tweet:
"He [awemany] *did not* mention the inflation bug in the email, still
he has proof
he was aware of that before sending out the report"
then tweet continue referring a reddit post where awemany while trying
to prove he  was the original author of the report, included a timestamped note
containing the following text:
    BitcoinABC does not check for duplicate inputs when processing a block,
    only when inserting a transaction into the mempool.
    This is dangerous as blocks can be generated with duplicate transactions
    and then sent through e.g. compact block missing transactions and avoid
    hitting the mempool, creating money out of thin air.
  /u/awemany
this the timeline of the timestamping process:
as you can see the note was submitted to originstamp.org before the
report email was sent.
Furthermore as you should be aware, having been copied on the report,
awemany specifically
said that "[the assert(is_spent)] *seems* to prevent the worse outcome
of monetary inflation"
I guess that in the hurry of informing you and other people involved of the DoS
vector he identified and proved, he decided to give priority to
informing Core about that
rather than waiting and continue exploring the idea he had about exploiting the
code to create coins out of thin air.
