I almost did not update to 0.13.0 because the test suite was failing due to python errors. How to fix them was posted on bitcointalk.
0.13.1 came with new python errors in the test suite. So I just said fuck it.
When the test suite actually works in my fairly standard environment (CentOS) in the distributed release, I will upgrade.
Until then, I'm not jumping through hoops to make the test suite work and I'm not running clients that haven't passed the test suite so that's why I almost didn't update to 0.13.0 and haven't updated since.

For 0.13.0 I had to do
export LANG=en_US.utf8
before running the test suite. I build in clean chroot build environment to avoid accidental linking to non-standard libraries, and in that environment the LANG is normally set to C as LANG normally doesn't matter for compiling software that is expected to run regardless of what the LANG is.
That I believe was fixed in 0.13.1.
In 0.13.1 the error is
Running test/bitcoin-util-test.py...
Traceback (most recent call last):

0.13.0 test works just fine (once the LANG is set to something utf8)

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] consensus rule change for TX fee safety 
I think the next hard fork should require a safety rule for TX fees.
15 BTC TX fee for < 7 BTC of outputs.
Probably either a typo or client bug.
My guess is the user was using a client that does not adjust TX fee, and needed to manually set it in order to get the TX in the block sooner, and meant 15 mBTC or something.
I suggest that either :
A) TX fee may not be larger than sum of outputs
B) TX fee per byte may not be larger than 4X largest fee per byte in previous block
Either of those would have prevented this TX from going into a block.
Many people I know are scared of bitcoin, that they will make a TX and make a mistake they can't undo.
Adding protections may help give confidence and there is precedence to doing things to prevent typo blunders - a public address has a four byte checksum to reduce the odds of a typo.
This kind of mistake is rare, so a fix could be included in the coming HF for the possible July 2017 block increase.
Thank you for your time.

You have to not only produce a ripemd160 collision, you have to produce a collision that is also a valid sha-256 hash - and that's much much much more difficult.
