@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] feature: Enhance privacy by change obfuscation 
Damian Williamson via bitcoin-dev This would be really expensive for the network due to the bloat in UTXO
size, a cost everyone has to pay for. Not to mention the fact that it
doesn't really seem that private, as the wallet is likely going to have
to rejoin those inputs in future transactions (and the user will have to
pay a high transaction fee as a result).
