@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] SHA1 collisions make Git vulnerable to attakcs by 
We should distinguish collision resistance from 2nd pre-image resistance, in general.
As previously written, we should care both hash output length and algorithm itself. The weakness of SHA-0 (preliminary version of SHA-1) was reported in 2004, then many research on the structure of SHA-1 were conducted. In the case of SHA-2, it is harder than SHA-1 to find collisions.
Existing security consideration and evaluation criteria were extensively discussed in the NIST SHA-3 competition. Please see the following sites.
We need similar analysis on RIPEMD160 and impacts of attacks on (RIPEMD160(SHA2(msg)). We can also refer the security assumption of hash chain in Asiacrypt 2004 Paper. In the discussion of SHA3 competition, we choose another hash design structure, so called "sponge structure." This leads diversity of design principles of hash function and gives resilience even when one hash design structure becomes vulnerable. As Peter Todd wrote, discussion on design structure and algorithm is important. Discussions on all of algorithm, output length and security requirements are needed.
At some future moment, we should think about transition of underlying hash functions. I?m working on this subject and will present an idea at IEEE S&B.
