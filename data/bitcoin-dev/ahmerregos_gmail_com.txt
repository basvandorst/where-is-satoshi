@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Improving Pre and Post Merging Abilities With 
I'm proposing re-writing bitcoin codebase in Python for improving pre and
post merging abilities, faster operations and better understandability.
Python is a fast language with C support, it is good with hashing things,
it has a good syntax and everyone can read /  understand it unlike C++.
I am willing the coordinate the transformation operation and i believe it
would be really good the get rid of C++.
