@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Two questions about segwit implementation 
op_pushdata allows for unsigned integers and thus it uses the extra byte to
specify that.
A varint (varlen) is unsigned.  0 and anything <= 252 is one byte length,
so 00.
Because you don't have the number of witnesses as you have for
inputs/outputs. The witness data length is assumed to be the same as the
inputs length. And then for non-segwit inputs you need the 00 to specify
that it is empty.
Hope that helps.
