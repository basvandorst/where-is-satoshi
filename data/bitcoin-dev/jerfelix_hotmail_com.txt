It seems to me that there's a huge need for a paper currency that is counterfeit-resistant, inexpensive to print, internationally recognized (border-less), fits in a wallet, and machine readable.
I pitched this idea at the Cincinnati Bitcoin meetup last week, and I didn't get thrown out, so I took the time to document a proposed standard to accomplish this.  I've put my ideas into BIP format, so that you can see what I have in mind, although I picked some BIP numbers myself that seem to be available.  Call them "proposed proposals", or "provisional BIPs".  I've numbered them provisionally BIP-80 to BIP-84.
If you guys think that this idea has some merit, let's discuss.
Submitted with humility and some fear of getting laughed out of here...

Thanks for all the feedback, and for everyone who read through the docs.  My BIP numbering was a blunder, and I have revised the numbering to be PCP-0 (Paper Currency Proposal Number 0) through PCP-4.   I think I was brain-dead on that, sorry, and I am now on PCP.
Please allow me to walk you through my thought process on Paper Currency, if you aren't sold that there's merit.
At present time, paper currency undeniably serves a major purpose in society and has a huge value.  Whether all-digital transfers can totally replace paper is still unknown.
And we citizens currently pay a lot to create paper money that is hard to counterfeit.  That too has tons of value, and it can be measured by looking at how much is spent to design, print, and protect fiat currencies from counterfeiting.  And you can add to that cost the societal costs of successful counterfeiting.  US Numbers exceed $800M annually, and are a fraction of the worldwide numbers.
And travelers routinely pay currency exchange fees, to acquire paper currency that is accepted in particular locales.  So a single internationally accepted, border-less paper currency would have high value, as it could potentially eliminate exchange fees for travelers.
Add all the above costs together, and you can see that this is a multi-billion dollar market that Bitcoin could disrupt.   We could actually eliminate all of those costs, while at the same time put Bitcoins into the hands of people in a form that is more familiar.
That's why this feels like a huge need that can be satisfied by creating a single standard for hard-to-counterfeit, cheap to print, paper currency.    I think the key is a "single standard" that the public recognizes.
I think that there are things that you can do with paper now that can't be done with all-digital transfers.  Maybe my perspective is too US-centric due to tipping customs, but it seems much easier to rapidly leave money for someone without their involvement via paper than digital transfers ever will be.   A recent video showed a stripper/dancer stop dancing and pose to have her QR Tattoo scanned for payment.  (Not that this is all about strippers and PCP, but...) paper would be a much more practical medium than digital transfer in a lot of scenarios.   If you think about it, whether you slipped her a Bitcoin Paper note or digitally transferred payment to her QR code, in neither case is she able to verify receipt of payment until she steps off stage.  But remember, we're typically talking about a buck or ten or twenty, not 3 bitcoins as shown in the video!
I saw a Reddit or bitcointalk comment, I believe credited to Mike Caldwell, saying that the author envisioned transactions where the buyer simply handed over private keys (paper wallets), and the merchant had all the electronics.  Reducing the electronics necessary for transfers seems to be desirable.  Should I have to carry a $300 cell phone to be able to carry and spend $20?  This would be moot if 100% of people had their electronic devices with them 100% of the time they need to spend money, and the device is 100% reliable.  I know for me that's not the case.
So, if the currency medium of paper has value, and Bitcoin can make paper currency more counterfeit-proof, and Bitcoin can eliminate costs, and it's a huge market, and the public is familiar with the paper paradigm, all that's left is for the community to come up with a standard.  That's why I took a crack at it, but I certainly welcome improvements!
Questions: 1)  Is paper a valuable medium for currency?  I contend yes.  2)  What's the proper tradeoff between convenience and security for paper Bitcoin Notes?  I opted for splitting the private key over two QR codes on opposite sides of the page, as opposed to BIP-38, and I explained my rationale in the documents.
The rest of the technical details (the splitting algorithm, for instance) need to be resolved.  But I took a crack at it.
And the marketing details (note size, shape, color, layout, text, do we call them "Bits", etc.) all need to be resolved.  again, I gave it my best effort, but I'm quite certain the community can do better than me!
First step, though, is to determine whether there's consensus to define a standard for paper bitcoin currency.
