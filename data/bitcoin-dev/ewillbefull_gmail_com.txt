I think it's important to expect PaymentRequest-only bitcoin URIs in the
future. Some types of payments (exotic transactions) may not make sense to
have a single fallback address. Or, a page with a bitcoin URI link may be
relying on a separate service provider to assemble the transaction.

============================== START ==============================
P2SH addresses support exotic transaction outputs, but not all exotic
transactions. This payment protocol can allow for combining multiple
outputs. A PaymentRequest for sending money to multiple parties, for
example, could not fall back to a single address.

I've created a simulation framework called simbit to simulate the selfish
mining attack, though it is general enough to simulate any p2p network. I
even put together a rough simulation of MinCen. The goal is to be fun/easy
to rapidly prototype protocols and strategies, and visualize them. It's
written in javascript, so it can be demoed in the web browser or run on
It's still in early alpha and a lot of things are missing.
Feedback is appreciated!
