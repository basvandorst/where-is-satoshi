@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Securing wallet on paper 
I don't know yet the details of how a wallet looks like internally,
but I think it should be possible to print the wallet incl. acct nbr
out on classical paper (as base16 or base64 etc.) for filing it
in a physical home or bank safe.
Later, typing it from paper to a small converter program that recreates the wallet file.
IMO this is a good security against possible computer hardware disasters.
Of course one has to secure this further with encryption against bank fraud/theft etc.
Ie. the output on paper should be encrypted, and the owner
should place the key somewhere else.
I would suggest the developers make such functionality available for the user.
