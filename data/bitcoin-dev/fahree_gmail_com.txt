@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Making bitcoin traceability harder 
Dear bitcoin developers,
trading arbitrary amounts of bitcoins makes it easier to trace who
does what just by observing the amounts being traded, and where the
residual money ends up: e.g. you can identify that obviously, the
recurrent user of address A sent 2.5 bitcoins to the recurrent user of
address B, keeping the rest of his money in A. If instead bitcoin
users practice the discipline, enforced by the client software by
default, of only keeping a power-of-two amount of satoshis in use-once
wallets except where public donation addresses are meant, then tracing
suddenly becomes much harder.
Whether this particular discipline is the best to implement or not,
shouldn't bitcoin clients enforce SOME discipline that makes tracing
harder? After all we know that uniformed goons are eager to watch
who's trading with whom and to crack down on users. We shouldn't be
making it easy for them, though this will mean slightly higher
transaction cost. Merchants would then generate not one but a series
of new addresses at each transaction, and the customer would send
appropriately sized buckets of satoshis to each of the addresses.
There should just be a standard way to specify an amount and a list of
addresses as a target for payment, that merchants can communicate to
customers (though that might require e.g. higher resolution QR codes).
Has this idea already been considered before? Accepted or rejected?

Dear Luke,
thanks for your prompt response.
That's a useful reminder.
Even when you don't reuse your address, by considering the amounts in
a transaction, it is often easy to identify what is the main amount
and what is the residual. e.g. "oh, he spent $1.99 worth of bitcoin
out of his big bitcoin address, so the $1.99 is being paid, and the
rest is still the same person", and so trace identities. By using
power-of-two buckets (based on the binary expansion of the amount), it
becomes harder to do amount analysis. Sometimes, buckets are joined or
split, but that still doesn't help much identify how several buckets
combine into one transaction. As for transaction fees ? indeed, they
should probably be paid in separate small-bucket transactions. I don't
see any particular difficulty about it.
There is nothing urgent indeed. Nevertheless, I fear that the current
usage pattern is too easily traceable, and that tweaks such as the one
I'm proposing could make amount-based tracing much harder.
Thanks for your hard work!
