I don't think Amir wants to put it into the protocol, but I still
don't like much the proposal if it has to rely on servers.
As an aside, even if firstbits it's not useful enough for the human
memory, it is still useful for QR-codes like in the case of green
addresses's POS instant payments.
Would it be too strange to use namecoin?
Some devices may need to rely on block exploring servers, but it is
the easiest decentralized solution that comes to mind.

I didn't thought about firstbits scalability, but the "registering
crap" and squatting arguments don't apply to green addresses because
no one wants fancy or easy to memorize names there. Is just a way to
make the bitcoin addresses shorter in the green addresses protocol to
be able to have various of them in the same QR-code.
I see, the point is to be able to type the alias directly into the client.
I like the DNS proposal. This would allow for both well known working
centralized technology and namecoin (not proven, but decentralized)
options to be used.

No decentralized solution for non-fixed addresses comes to mind.
If we're going to always rely on servers, we should definitely offer
dynamic addresses.
There was a bitcoin service in the forum to which merchants send
different addresses and the service manages the payments for the
merchant without holding his private keys. The service identified each
shopping cart by a combination of the total amount and the selected
address for that cart. I don't remember the name of the service
It could easily implement aliases (the same alias for various rotating
addresses). Of course, the service provider still knows your income
and you still need to provide new addresses to maintain your privacy.
I say this just in case it inspires someone.

What if we specify "bitcoin" to make it easier for software (maybe the
browser, a plugin for the browser, the bitcoin client analyzing the
clipboard...) to easily detect that you expect a bitcoin address when
going to url?
If puted in the bitcoin client, the "bitcoin://" is optional (? and
can also be replaced by http ?) since from the context you already
expect an address or an url that will give you the address.
In the browser:
In the bitcoin client:
  ??
Maybe in the bitcoin client you can put any site and the client
downloads the web to look for occurrences of "bitcoin://" (? or just
valid addresses ?) in it. It caches and shows them to you to decide
what to do with each one.
I have used other programs (jdownloader) that read the clipboard
looking for patterns in links and is very convenient.
Maybe then parameters for the client can be added to this.
Whatever the community have planned for bitcoin URIs.

You're right. Then servers should not use a different address with

I thought the interaction was just the server answering with an
address (maybe also amount and other details). But we don't have to
define how the server will get that address.
Some possibilities:
-A static address: less anonymity, but some people may not care. Say a
donation address.
-The servers stores the recipient private keys and generates a new one
for each payment.
-The server stores a set of addresses provided by the recipient and it
manages what address it gives in each request (like in the web service
I told you I can't find).
IANA reserves some namespace for bitcoin. All right.
The problem comes later.
* Systems such as [BITCOIN] have quirks that require slightly
      delayed settlement due to the nature of their decentralized,
      consensus-based approach to fiscal transfer.  Users requiring
      instant settlement MAY thus see benefit in the use of a
      centralized proxy system or organization as an instantaneous
      financial settlement provider (the 'institution').
As I understand it (probably I'm wrong, because I haven't read the
whole IIBAN draft) there would be a "bitcoin institution" that would
map bitcoin addresses to the bitcoin subspace of the IIBAN.
"    * IANA MAY delegate management of portions of the IIBAN name space
      through such institutions."
If we can find a deterministic method to map the subspace the all
possible bitcoin addresses, everything's fine again. But if that's not
possible, we would need a central institution to manage the mapping
and that would be a step back in decentralization.
I can't find the answer of Gavin's question "How is the mapping done?"
in your post. I'll re-read it though.

People don't have to write or memorize the firstbit address, it's just
to have a shorter string to put it in the QR code. In this particular

If we chose the simple URI proposal namecoin can still be integrated
to map the IP of the server by those who want to.
Does it removes the necessity of the certificates?
If so, we should let people decide between HTTP, HTTPS, namecoin or
whatever they trust.
Shouldn't we be also discussing the valid format of the answered
message? I mean fields like "amount", "concept" and such.

Ok, so HTTP is not an option unless it shows a huge warning. I don't
know the HTTPS possible attack, but maybe it needs a warning message
too, from what you people are saying. Although using namecoin to
identify hosts may be the more secure option, it's integration with
the client seems more difficult and probably most clients won't
support it. Using namecoin to directly specify the payment address
seems a bad idea for most cases for the reasons that have been said.
For the "answer format" JSON seems ok, but I mean a "negotiating
protocol" like luke-jr says. I'd even include green addresses there
but probably many of you don't like the idea.

With the current system, the timestamp can also be cheated, but miners
have no direct incentive to do it. With your system, they increase
their probability of mining a block by putting a false timestamp.
Also, where's the network clock you're talking about? Isn't it the
timestamps in the blockchain?

2011/11/23, Andy Parkins :
Well, I meant "the probability of  your block being the hardest".
What a miner can do is hash the block (cheating the timestamp) for 2
more minutes than the rest of the people and then send it to the other
nodes. Nodes cannot possibly know when did you hashed the block only
by looking at their clock when they receive it, because there's also
network latency.
1) This is part of the satoshi client but not the protocol. A miner
can rewrite this part of the code and there won't be anything in the
chain that contradicts the protocol.
2) I haven't read the code but I'm pretty sure that's not a perfect
decentralized clock.
I will be more specific. Where's the network clock in the chain (in
the protocol)?

But the protocol must have a deterministic way to determine if a block
must be accepted or rejected.
I don't know what NTP is, but if you can have a perfect distributed
clock your proposal may work.

I'm very interested in this. I was expecting transitive/multi-hop
transactions (Ripple) with colored coins, and I don't understand why
is not possible.
SIGHASH_ALL: This is the default. It indicates that everything about
the transaction is signed, except for the input scripts. Signing the
input scripts as well would obviously make it impossible to construct
a transaction, so they are always blanked out. Note, though, that
other properties of the input, like the connected output and sequence
numbers, are signed; it's only the scripts that are not. Intuitively,
it means "I agree to put my money in, if everyone puts their money in
and the outputs are this".
Why "Signing the input scripts as well would obviously make it
impossible to construct a transaction"?
I don't understand that part. I think a new SIGHASH_* type that
doesn't pay attention to that "obviously" is needed to achieve what we
Say we want the following transaction:
A 1 satoshi -> B 1 satoshi -> C 100 btc -> A
It would be necessary to sign the following:
Inputs: from srcA, from srcB,
Outputs: 1 satoshi to destB, 1 satoshi to destC, 100 btc to destA
"from srcC" is not really necessary.
This same scheme can be used for n-hops.
