I think it makes more sense to not add a duplicate parameter.  Current implementations will break if multiple r parameters are used (either reject the URI completely, or do something undefined).  If a new parameter is used, then the current implementations will just ignore it if they don?t support it.

Multiple parameters is currently undefined as far as I can tell.  Should the client take the first, last, or ignore it completely if there are multiple of any parameter?  I think that?s the point of the parameter pollution discussion, which will define it one way or the other.
I?m only familiar with the Electrum implementation, which is currently checking for any duplicate parameters and treating the entire URI as invalid if duplicate parameters exist (following the parameter pollution suggestions).

I have a python implementation that seems to pass this test vector:

I?m not familiar with how the daemon works, however could you set up two daemons listening local on different ports and with a separate daemon or normal dns server that proxies incoming queries to either domain? I don?t know if standard DNS servers would support that, or if you would need a custom proxy application.

You would set it up as a forwarder, not as a zone transfer to bind.  That should proxy the request every time and only cache based on any TTL that?s set in the response.
Here?s an example of how it could work:
