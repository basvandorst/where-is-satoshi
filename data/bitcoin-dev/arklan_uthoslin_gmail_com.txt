Hi guys.
So, as I mentioned on the bitcointalk.org forums thread about the
foundation, I want to get involved in the QA side of bitcoin
development. I've done functional testing in the video game industry for
years. I've read all the messages in this thread, but I'm left unclear how
I can most effectively and quickly being helping out. Could I get a bit of
a directional nudge?

thanks for the great reply jeff. i'm going to get a virtual machine set up
on my system later tonight so at the very least, i myself can start testing.
steve - haven't heard from you in almost a week. I'd still really like to
get a look at the test cases and such you set up.

I'd emailed steve last week to try and get a look at the test cases and
such he worked up, but I've not heard from him. Other then that, I'll grab
the RC tonight and go through it.

while perfectly true for now, hopefully that won't remain the case as we
get people on board with testing. ...ok, sure, it might be a while... but
having the separate list with help with archival type stuff and other
things eventually. we'll see how useful it actually is in time.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Ultraprune merged in mainline 
i can happily start testing this this weekend. however i'm not 100% sure
how to get a copy. i looked around github, but wasn't sure which was the
proper project. could i get a link and a simple "do this, this and this"?
i feel like a newb. ugh.

unfortunately my winter has proven a complicated series of significant life
events - new work, etc - which sees me with little free time to help out.
