Can we recognize Peter Todd's lack of respect and outright unprofesionalism here?
Peter: Someone so young with so little actual experience shouldn't be going around so casually bad-mouthing the work of others or dismissing people with decades more experience than you. Don't write long angry rants against the ideas of others when you haven't even read what they have to say. Own up to it when you get caught doing it. You'll find out the hard way that blackmailing people, even your clients, into using your ideas may get you attention, but it'll make you a pariah in the long run. (does encouraging illegal fraud belong on this mailing list?) Remember that twitter is public. Do you really want future employers reading jokes about pedophilia and rape? Do you want to be known for snappy one liners and giving journalists headlines or writing solid code that gets used by real businesses? (not "DarkLeaks") Are you trying to be a rock star or team member?

You mean you wrote a bunch of FUD about zeroconf transactions while working for companies like Coinbase and GreenAddress that were trying to sell 100% centralized solutions? Lets just be clear on this.
I and many other people tried your replace-by-fee tools and found out that they worked **maybe** 1-2% of the time. You claimed 95% success A "team"
You mean a **Company**? We don't need yet another 100% centralized LocalBitcoins snooping on our transactions.

Are we going to get an answer to this or Adam Back's critique? Doesn't sound like this so-called "proof-of-publication" actually works according to the experts. Is it an concept anyone but Peter Todd actually believes in?

You're the Chief Scientist of __ViaCoin__ a alt with 30 second blocks and you have big banks as clients. Shit like replace-by-fee and leading the anti-scaling mob is for your clients, not Bitcoin. Get the fuck out.
