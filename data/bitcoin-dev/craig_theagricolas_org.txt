This should probably be
*    server.registerMethod(method_ptr(new ExtraGetBalance(extrawallet)));
*    server.registerMethod(method_ptr(new ExtraSendToAddress(extrawallet)), Auth("username","password"));
right?  Easy to miss if both wallets were empty in your quick test...  Awesome job with libcoin, BTW!

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Sending Bitcoins using RSA keys 
Maybe I'm missing something crucial, but what benefit does this dance give over
the slightly more obvious mechanism of simply:
1) Alice generates a new address with her bitcoin client and sends the BTC to
   this new address
2) Alice exports the private key for that address (there is a well supported
   format for that)
3) Alice writes a nice email to Bob, including that exported private key
4) Alice encrypts the email with Bob's public key using GPG and sends it to him
   by email
5) Bob decrypts the email
6) Bob imports the private key into his wallet
There's no need for sending a whole wallet; just the one key is needed.  Every
bit of infrastructure needed above already exists.  And of course, the above
has the same issue as your proposal; this is a way for two trusting parties to
send BTC without using the Bitcoin network, but it's not a payment mechanism.
They now share control of an address; whoever spends that BTC first wins, so
until Bob uses the Bitcoin network to spend that BTC to another address that
only he controls, it's still in joint custody.  And if ensuring that he has
control of the BTC is the last (implicit) step in the procedure above, as well
as yours, then they might as well have simply used the Bitcoin network to do
the transfer in the first place.
Did I miss the point entirely?

PS. Re-reading, I realize that the above might come off sounding snarky or
    dismissive; it's not intended that way.  I'm wondering if I'm missing the
    big picture.

BTW, Adam, I suspect you might be using the console in the GUI, and that might be
under Windows for all I know, but I usually do it this way on the command line
under Linux:
echo -n "Password: ";bitcoind walletpassphrase `stty -echo;read p;echo $p;stty echo` 60; echo
This uses the JSON API to unlock the wallet (for 60 seconds; which is the "60"
at the end), and should work for either the GUI (if you start it with the
-server flag) or the headless bitcoind.  It keeps the password that you type
off the console, and also keeps it out of the history file.  The only issue
with it is that it will show up in the process tree as an argument of the
command for the period of time that the JSON API is being prepared and sent,
which should be fairly short.  This might be a concern if you are on a
multi-user system (you probably shouldn't be doing this anyway), or
worry that spyware might be monitoring for passwords (though if you are
worried about spyware, you should already be concerned about keyloggers,
so...) I doubt this will work (without significant modifications) on
Windows without Cygwin, though.
