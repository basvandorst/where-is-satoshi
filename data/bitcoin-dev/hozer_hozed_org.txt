I want to get some feedback.. I've used distributed version control systems for a long time, and the most useful feature is to be able
to merge two different forks.
So what's the equivalent of this for Bitcoin or other crypto-currencies?
Let's suppose that me and my friends get 'islanded' from the rest of
the internet for a week, but we still want to trade bitcoin. It would
work if there are local miners, until we reconnect.
Suppose we have the main chain (Alice), while bob is on a boat, trading
with some friends, but has no network connectivity.
When bob reconnects with Alice, a 'Merge' transaction happens where a miner looks at bob's forked blockchain, sees no double-spends, and includes BOTH chains.
Now suppose someone on bob's boat has a buggy client, or sent a transaction before disconnect that results in a double-spend on the So we have a merge conflict, which generally requires human interaction,
so bob and his friends broadcast a MERGE request with a transaction fee
sufficient to cover reconciling the double-spends, AND incentivize a miner to do some extra work to merge.
Thoughts everyone?

Now maybe this is a fatal flaw with Bitcoin's hard upper limit for number
of coins, but any miners that with good faith tried to support an islanded
bitcoin network now have generate transactions that get clobbered when
the network reconnects.
I can imagine a way to do this with some freicoin-like demurrage, which
would only impact new coinbase based on the percentage of the hashing
power that was on the other side of the fork. So if you are with the
95% of hashing power, you keep 95% of the new coins when the other 5%
shows back up from being islanded.
And this is also way more complicated than what I had first imagined
to do securely and reliably.

I understand the theoretical benefits of multi-sig. But if you want
to make this mind-numbingly simple, do it on the *existing* single-sig.
But why in the world do we not have a *business* that offers bitcoin
wallet insurance? The bitcoin world (and this list) ran around blaming
MtGox and users for being 'stupid' to trust mtgox.
So start a multi-level marketing business that offers *insurance* so
if your bitcoin wallet gets hacked/stolen/whatever, your 'upstream'
or whomever sold you the wallet comes to your house with a new computer or installs the new wallet software, or whatever, or just
makes it good.
Now, if the **insurance underwriter** decides that multisig will reduce fraud, and **tests it**, then I'd say we do multi-sig. But right
now we are just a bunch of technology wizards trying to force our own
opinions about what's right and 'simple' for end users without ever
asking the damn end-users.
And then we call the end-users idiots because some scammer calls them
and says "I'm calling from Microsoft and your computer is broke, please
download this software to fix it".

Because turning on SSL gives pool operators a way to hack your miners.
Just because SSL is the answer for financial services regulated security
theatre, where fraud means you just roll-back the transaction, it does not
mean it is actually a good cryptographic solution.
There are far better mechanisms that could be implemented using ECDSA keys (aka bitcoin addresses) to authenticate both miners and pools, but
the problem is there zero economic incentive to do so. As long as the

support the hardware, 24x7 monitoring, and maybe a couple of full nodes
running on the servers as well.
And to pick up from another comment on this thread if you don't understand
some of the differences between git and mercurial, or how to set up servers
that pull from git and mirror to mercurial, you will have a lot harder time
tracking down and removing malicous code that could get injected if someone
gets root on a Github server.

coherent global state, and what is similiar or different to Bitcoin's global consensus model of what the balance of every bitcoin address is.

This is why I clone git to mercurial, which is generally designed around the
assumption that history is immutable. You can't rewrite blockchain history,
and we should not be re-writing (rebasing) commit history either.
The problem with github is it's too tempting to look at the *web page*, which is NOT pgp-signed, and hit the 'approve' button when you might have someone
in the middle approving an unsigned changeset because you're in a hurry to
get the latest new critical OpenSSL 0day security patch build released.
We need multiple redundant 'master' repositories run by different people in
different jurisdictions that get updated on different schedules, and have all
of these people pay attention to operational security, and not just outsource
it all to github because it's convenient.
There's no reason to *stop* using github, cause it *is* easy... but you want
to have multiple review of *the actual code*, not just signatures and see if the changes really do make sense.

Thank you Jeff.
Having looked at a lot of linux code, and now a lot of bitcoin code, the
biggest long-term systemic risk I see is that Bitcoin has is the lack of code janitors.
The problem is that janitoring was *disruptive* for non-x86 linux architectures
when it first got going, and it's going to be very disruptive for bitcoin as
well, but it **needs** to happen. The code is too complex and hard to follow as it is now. (now, I could just
be speaking because I haven't paid the social debt of looking at the latest
bitcoin code, including libconsensus), but there really needs to be a focus
on readability, maintainability, and (as much as I hate to say it) a rather
hard-line policy on coding standards.
I don't care which tabbing style or column width you pick, but **pick one**,
and enforce it across the entire codebase.
Maybe this should be bitcoin-stable, and bitcoin-devel, with a 6-9 month
social expectation of minimal cosmetic changes in -stable, with a 1 month
'merge window' where -devel turns into -stable.

that I 'electronically' signed a mortgage document giving some random internet company the rights to foreclose on my home does not mean that my local county Judge or Sheriff are going to do anything if the internet

Good accounting systems (such as mercurial, and proper double-entry financial accounting tools) allow reverting a bad commit, or bad data

Courts can't legislate our code, and we can't expect them to download

unless we meet them at least halfway, and probably need to propose model
municipal and county ordinances that go along with our code releases.

Okay, why the everloving FUCK is there not someone on this list with a

I started using bitcoin because I could audit the code, and when the
developer cabal does stuff 'off-list' what you do is hand over market manipulation power to the selected cabal of company insiders who are
discussing things 'off-list'. The people having a 'private' discussion about how to solve this are
TAKING MONEY from everyone else, by having access to insider information.
I don't think any of the developers actually have a clue this is the result, because a good chunk of them are employed by for-profit companies
funded by venture capital, and VC lawyers are very good at writing employment contracts that provide plausible deniability of insider The press MAKES MONEY (okay, takes money) by manipulating markets,
and venture capitalists pay lots of money to ensure the market is
manipulated in ways they can profit from.
Private market manipulation is one of the costs of anonymity and privacy,
and I don't really like paying for some off-list discussion of what appears
to be a serious scalability and usability problem.
Bitcoin is such a powerful tool because it broadcasts transactions to
the network for everyone to see. Can we please broadcast some more technical details to this mailing list,
including exactly what MtGox is doing, and how they wish to resolve it?
If you gave me the entire code stack that MtGox runs on under an AGPLv3
license, I'm pretty sure I, along with everyone else here could come up
with a workable solution. I think a code release would be a huge win for MtGox as well, and would cement their position as market leader in
transparent cryptocurrency trading.
Otherwise we are just a bunch of dinghys getting capsized one by one
in a sea of market-manipulating white whales. Isn't the closed door
market manipulation of the big banks one of the reasons we all started

If you've got any ideas for a better forum, let me know.
MtGox is one of the largest public faces of the code being developed here. If
the public perception is that this is a bitcoin protocol flaw, then we need
some damned strong and compelling public arguments about why it ain't so. But
after some thought, that's not the critical issue I want to raise on this list.
If something about the implementation, the protocol, of bitcoin-qt or bitcoind
makes it easy for an attacker to mutate transactions and hard for an 'end-user'
such as MtGox to confirm payments, then we've got a fundamental user-interface
We can get all indignant about RTFM or telling the users they are idiots, but
that's not really going to be good for long-term adoption and use.
My opinion is part of the development process should be to react to public
perceptions of how the code is being used (and mis-used), and how the market is
being manipulated, and try to improve it so the whole system is stable,

drive the market price of privacy down to zero.
Who's paying the network/development/bandwidth/etc cost for privacy?

ideal, they just want payments to work and to download cat pictures.
If you say 'regular address re-use is deprecated, and the top 1% in bitcoin
weatlh who own 95% of the miners want privacy', well fine. But you just opened yourself up to 'OccupyBitcoin', and an altcoin that ENCOURAGES plain

Who pays for it? From what I see it's going to double the amount of data needed per address, further centralizing 'full' nodes. I'm fine if the NSA
is paying for privacy (I actually trust them more than banks and advertisers),
but let's just be honest, okay?
If socializing the cost of privacy is Bitcoin's goal, and giving the benefits
to a few that understand it and/or have the resources to determine privacy
providers that won't scam them, then say so, so I can get on with launching
a 'transparencycoin' with a modified code that explicitly ALWAYS re-uses
addresses, and has miners and pools that charge more for addresses they have
never seen before. I bet it will be more distributed and have about half the
average transaction cost of Bitcoin, because most people *just don't care*
about privacy if they get cheap and/or free services.

If you have to invoke a java/ios/etc app you are never going to be consistent,
however if you have a GPL linux kernel module (like I proposed for my still

If you do this right, every device has a well-known payment address for it's
'instant' wallet, and it should be trivial for merchants to just look at the
blockchain and confirm the instant wallet has a sufficient balance to cover
the transaction.
One more comment... having a bitcoin payment application 'check certs' seems
like a great way to ensure that Visa maintains their market share. If it's my phone, and I press the hardware payment button, and I only put $50 on it, I frankly don't care if there's a cert or not. The last thing I

BITCOIN DEVELOPERS to remind the people who profit from our efforts they need

and I would like to respectfully disagree, but still collaborate on all the
other things where bitcoin-core *is* the best-in-class code available.
A truly 'distributed' system must support multiple alchains, and multiple proof-of-work hash algorithms, and probably support proof-of-stake as well.
If sha-256 is the only game in town the only advantage over the federal
reserve is I can at least audit the code that controls the money supply,
but it's not in any way distributed if the hash power is concentrated
among 5-10 major pools and 5-10 sha-256 asic vendors.
I find it very irresponsible for Bitcoiners to on one hand extol the virtues

I was *almost* convinced that the 'new key per address' was a good idea

as a way to make sure all your keys are leaked all over RAM and the nearby
electromagnetic spectrum with side channels intentionally embedded in

I foresee 2^128 being brute forceable in 20-25 years. See below.
So I assume this image is using the Landauer principle for minimum energy (  ), however
it is unknown (to me at least) if a reversible computing ecdsa forcing
algorithm could be implemented. (this may or may not be a quantum
computing device)
Let's suppose for a moment you could, and get a million times better than the Landauer pinciple limit of 2.85 zJ per bit, so we have total
energy to cycle through 128 bits of address space of:
units "2**128 * 2.85zJ / 1e6" "megawatt*hours"
        * 269.39021
An attacker with a sub-Landauer limit/1e6  cracker would need a lot of
silicon area, and a couple of hours energy from a large wind farm, and
could siphon that energy out in a rural area without anyone noticing anything other than a few shipping containers and that the wind turbines
are running more on windy days.
If we go back to just Landauer limit, and assume a 10MW system that runs 24x7 (much like the NCSA Blue Waters Cray machine), we need:
(please check my math, or point out any stupid assumptions I've made)
units "2**128 * 2.85zJ / 10 megawatts" " years"
        * 3073.1914
Or 3000 years. Well that still sounds pretty safe. How about 250MW?
units "2**128 * 2.85zJ / 250 megawatts" " years"
        * 122.92766
Now I'm starting to get worried, because when I started computing, it
was on an 8-bit CPU that was measured in thousand operations-per-second.
In 1996 the largest supercomputer in the world was ASCII Red, with an
amazing 1 trillion floating-point operations per second. This morning
I have a 1-2 Teraflop water-cooled graphics processor sitting next to
me warming the room.
I expect in 5-10 years we'll have silicon with 256 bit registers that
may be able to do thousands or millions of ECDSA calculations per
second per computation unit.

there is a single entity (which may be a cartel) which *effectively*
controls between 30% and 50% of the sha-256 hashing power and is quite
terrified of any alternative, and attempts to purchase, consume, or eliminate any entities that might dilute it's controlled hash rate or
pose a risk of switching to a new algorithm.
We must have a system in which 1 to 10% of the hashrate can provide a
reasonable check-and-balance and competitive pressure to 90% of the
hash rate, or it's going to be fundamentally unstable, and we will
just re-create 'to big to fail' all over again.
You speak of ecological crime without proposing any mechanism in which the ecologically correct thing is also the economically rational thing.

Most money/payment systems include some method to reverse or undo

I see a world in which we have many blockchains, along with not-quite

are inherent engineering trade-offs that one chain can never resolve.

The problem with that statement is I trust a merchant that I went into

The attack surface of devices in your computer is huge. A motivated attacker
just needs to get an intern into a company that makes some kind of component
or system that's in your computer, cloud server, hardware wallet, or what have you that has firmware capable of reading your private keys.
With the possibility of mass trojaned hardware, if we are going to trust the system, it must somehow allow reversal through a human-in-the-loop.
We built 'reliable' TCP on top of unreliable ethernet networks. My experience
with networking was if you tried to guarantee message delivery at the lowest
level, the system got exceedingly complicated, expensive, and brittle.
Most applications, in particular paying someone you already trust, are quite
happy running on reversible systems, and in some cases more reliable and lower risk. (carrying non-reversible cash is generally considered risky)
The problem is that if the base currency is assumed to be non-reversible, then it's brittle and becomes 'too big to fail'.
Where the blockchain improves on everything else is in transparency. If you
reverse transactions a lot, it will be obvious from an analysis. I would much
rather deal with a known, predictable, and relatively continous transaction
reversal rate (percentage) than have to deal with sudden failures where some anonymous bad actor makes off with a fortune.
We already have zero-conf double-spend transaction reversal, why not explicitly
extend that a little in a way that senders and receivers have a choice to use it, or not?

This is a non-issue.
If the hard-fork is not a consensus, then those of us that don't consent
ignore the fool that tried to hard-fork.
If a fool attempting a non-consensus hard-fork actually breaks something,
then you have a fragile system that needs some serious re-thinking.
I think a non-consensus hard-fork would be the best thing that could happen to the bitcoin ecosystem long-term, because it would force some
re-examination of some very bad assumptions.

Bitcoin was/is a disruptive technology for credit card payment processors,
and replace-by-fee/stag-hunt is a disruptive technology for Bitcoin payment
I think whether you call it scorched earth is a bit more of a reflection of
whether you stand to make money, or lose money from the distruption.
Personally, I think 'first-seen' is a dangerous scorched-earth policy that
only benefits the people who own the internet routers that determine what
is seen first.
But from the standpoint of consensus, can we at least agree that it's a
*node policy* decision, and the market particpants should be free to choose
whichever policy works best for them?
Otherwise, I think the only way to make 'first-seen' work is by adding a timestamp to CTransaction.

So let's play this out a little.. Let's call it "Solomon's spend[1]"
Exchange gets hacked, bitcoins move.
The exchange has a contract with an insurance company and miners for 'scorched earth' theft response that creates a double-spend of the original transaction.
So now there's a 10,000 bitcoin incentive for miners to roll back the
chain and start (re)mining the block where the theft occurred.
The exchange gets an insurance payout, some miner wins the lottery, and
the thief gets nothing. Seems like a good deal, what am I missing?

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP clearing house addresses 
I think many of us who think about human - computer interactions see the
need for a well defined process to roll back unexpected behavior in a computer
system. My 2014 era proposal is The fundamental assumption around cryptocoins is you have a secret (private
key) known only by you. Currently in bitcoin if that assumption changes, the
response is blame the user. 'Incompetence, etc, etc'
This is bad business. For any cryptocurrency to really get mass market, we
need to provide our users with key revocation, to be used when the assumption
about being the only holder of a secret is broken.
I think there's a hardfork-worthy choice here:
1) implement reversal/revocation as an add-on feature
2) implement reversal/revocation as a fundamental that every address gets.
Ethereum made a quick hardfork choice to reverse a *single* instance of
unexpected behavior, and looks a lot like a bank bailout. We have the chance
to learn from this mistake, and, apparently, make a lot of money trading
on both sides of the hardfork.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Using a storage engine without UTXO-index 
I would advise anyone worried about 'hard drive access' to order a
512GB NVME (pci-express interface) flash drive (or a laptop), and
I expect the performance will make you wonder why you ever bothered
with cloud.
My (very brief) analysis of the performance of a full chain download
on a new laptop was that there was more overhead in lock contention and
database writes and it barely loaded the machine. Now maybe this is
because the flash **write** speed is slow (but still several orders
of magnitude above spinning disk), but random reads are sure blazing
Flash storage sizes also appear to be growing at similiar rates as the
total blockchain size.
Which begs another question: In a distributed byzantine fault-tolerant
system, why do we even need to bother with persistant storage, except
for long-term archival and chain of custody issues, which we could serialize the in-memory structures out as a stream to things like tape
drives or write-once optical media.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Height based vs block time based thresholds 
If there are miners that start doing 1 second timestamp advances, it would be
simpler (and probably safer) to require a minimum block time spacing of say
30 seconds or 1 minute, and orphan blocks that are too close in time and more
than say an hour behind real-time.
I cannot picture any realistic scenario in which an attempt to block activation
in this way is in anything other than a very expensive temper tantrum for any
miners foolish enough to attempt it.
It *might* be a delay tactic as a 'nuclear option' attack vector for a mining
cabal to run up the difficulty so high as to make it impractical to mine any
new blocks after the adjustment, but there are plenty of altcoins that have
hardforked and gotten along just fine after the same kind of thing due to
profit-switching pools.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] The Nuclear Option: BIP148 + MR POWA 
The fastest way to triple Bitcoin capacity is to split the network into
two or three different blockchains. We encourage forks of software, why
are blockchains somehow different?
Yes, this is risky, and probably volatile.
I honestly don't expect lots of people with large amounts of money invested (exchanges, financial institutions, etc) to go along with something like this, and that say 90% of the wealth with stay concentrated
in whatever chain has the majority SHA256 hashpower.
But as a game-theory excercise to see who's theories actually work?
I highly encourage a real-world test of all these theories.
I would also highly advise finding a simple and robust difficulty adjustment
that occurs every block instead of bitcoin/litecoin's 2016 block use.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] how to disable segwit in my build? 
============================== START ==============================
And this attitude is why bitcoin-core is going to get dropped and,
hopefully, instead of just one code to rule them all, we will have
good specifications and multiple competing implementations.
One of the significant adverse impacts of Segwit is the following:
When viewed on Github, less than one third of the consensus-critical
code is visible on-screen.
This is a maintenance and readability nightmare, in my opinion. There
are many good reasons why giving *users* the ability to firewall off
that code, maybe even with  as ugly as they are, would provide
some much better confidence that one is indeed, not running segwit.
I suspect it would help the community a great deal in comfort level
if this code were easier to read and used some type of coding standard
in which the default github view on the average browser shows all the
code without having a "hidden feature" that requires scrolling that
has no obvious UI indication you even need to scroll.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Requirement for pseudonymous BIP submissions 
I quite agree, and I would add that sometimes making yourself
recognisable is far more important that merit.
If we are really going to go for merit, then we probably need to go
all the way back to examine why is it developers and academics think
they need to have money to make code or reputation to do research.
The best code I've written is stuff I've given away for free, although
sometimes I'm able to leverage being recognized for having written something into getting paid to write more code. The best research
I've done has been self-funded, when I did not subconsciously have
a funding agent I was trying to please with the outcome of the We need a safe space for merit, how about

C'mon people.
Anyone remember when git didn't even exist and all we had was CVS, subversion, and BitKeeper?
Get me a couple of motivated grad students who know Python and we can
turn a combination of Mercurial, BitTorrent, and pynode into a distributed,
leaderless, decentralized version control system that can let users create a crypto key, anonymously propose BIPs, and then get paid in
crypto for the best commits.
Who else would contribute to a crowdfunding effort to do such at thing?

We are talking about money here. Decisions in this project are
not made based on 'merit', they are made based on ROI. If killing
the project is more profitable, many of the actors involved are
obligated to their shareholders to attempt to kill the project.
Or maybe in this case, they might be obligated to their investors
to attempt to try to run all the competing miners out of business
and acquire a majority stake in the hashpower.
If Merit were actually important, I would hope we would be
talking about a way to finance development in a way that provides
real financial incentives for merit, rather than what appear to
be some perverse incentives that seem to be rewarding short-term
traders, conflict, and further consolidation of mining and The other problem with merit is there are just about as many ideas
about what has merit as there are people judging the merit of the
For instance, I think demurrage and increasing the money supply are
ideas with more merit, but those ideas are not profitable to existing
bitcoin investors, and thus are not seriously discussed.
