@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Floating fees and SPV clients 
After reading all 99 messages in this thread, I think allowfee is just about perfect.
It effectively lets merchants to give an allowance against the purchase price for network fees, if they choose.  It is still up to the sender (and/or the sender's software) to get the fees right.  Sometimes the sender will need to pay more fees than allowed, and sometimes the sender will need to pay less.
We can't solve the fee problem, in general.  I'm not sure that we can even define it properly.  But this is something that we can do, that will be useful at least occasionally, and that will cause no harm the rest of the time.
P.S.  Clever senders can use this to defrag their wallets.  Who wants to write the patch for that?

Need is an awfully big word.  One thing we are certain of is that some guy telling us all that we are wrong is nowhere near the "need" level.
Don't take this the wrong way, but things like this make it very hard for us to take you seriously.
Please read up on how the system works, then read up on why we reject the argument from authority, then if you still have something to say, please do so in a proper venue.  One option for this discussion is the bitcointalk.org forums, where you will find literally dozens of threads proposing the exact same thing you are proposing.
This mailing list is NOT for political discussion.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] we can all relax now 
One of the things that really gets me going is when someone devises a model, tests it against itself, and then pretends that they've learned something about the real world.
Naturally, the Selfish Mining paper is exactly this sort of nonsense.  Their model is one with no latency, and one where the attacker has total visibility across the network.  An iterated FSM is not a suitable simulation of the bitcoin system.  The bitcoin network does not have states, and to the extent that you can pretend that we do, you can't simulate transitions between them with static probabilities.
The authors understand this deep down inside, even though they didn't work out the implications.  They handwave the issue by assuming a total sybil attack, and in true academic spirit, they don't realize that the condition necessary for the attack is far, far worse than the attack itself.
Greg said he'd like to run some simulations, and I'm thinking about it too.  Unfortunately, he is busy all week, and I'm lazy (and also busy for most of tomorrow).
If neither of us get to it first, I'm willing to pitch in 1 BTC as a bounty for building a general bitcoin network simulator framework. The simulator should be able to account for latency between nodes, and ideally within a node.  It needs to be able to simulate an attacker that owns varying fractions of the network, and make decisions based only on what the attacker actually knows.  It needs to be able to simulate this "attack" and should be generic enough to be easily modified for other crazy schemes.
(Bounty offer is serious, but expires in one year [based on the earliest timestamp that my mail server puts on this email], and /may/ be subject to change if the price on any reputable exchange breaks 1000 USD per BTC in that period.)
Basically, the lack of a decent network simulator is what allowed this paper to get press.  If the author had been able to see the importance of the stuff he was ignoring, we wouldn't be wasting so much time correcting him (and sadly the reporters that have no way to check his

The HTTP status code system seems to work well enough, and seems to give the best of both worlds.  A 3 digit numeric code that is machine-readable, and a freeform text note for humans.
The clever part about that system was in realizing that the numeric codes didn't need to account for every possible error. They just need to give the other node the most useful information, like "try that again later, I'm having a temporary problem" vs. "That is just plain wrong and it will still be wrong next time too, so don't bother to retry".
We can leave it to the humans to puzzle out the meaning of "403: values of txid gives rise to dom!"

Any reason not to use actual HTTP codes?  I'm not aware of any major deficiency in them.  Most of them won't apply to us, which is fine, they don't seem to apply to HTTP either.  We can extend the scheme on our own if we find a good reason to.
That implies 16 bits, or a varint.  I would avoid a string or varstring here; we already have a text field.  Varint vs. 16 bits is a minor issue, and arguments can be made in both directions.  I flipped a coin and got heads, so I'll say varint.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Finite monetary supply for Bitcoin 
At first, I thought this was a second April Fool's joke, but then I looked and saw that all of the BIPs really do use this format.  As far as I can tell, we are using this insane format because RFC 822 predates ISO 8601 by half a decade.
Since we don't have half a gajillion mail servers to patch, we could, if we desired, adopt a sensible date format here.  The cost to the community would be minimal, with probably not more than a half dozen people needing to update scripts.  It could even be as simple as one guy running sed s/parseabomination/parsedate/g

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Why are we bleeding nodes? 
Multi-sig requires infrastructure.  It isn't a magic wand that we can wave to make everyone secure.  The protocols and techniques necessary don't exist yet, and apparently no one has much of an incentive to create them.
I mean no offense, and I don't mean to pick on you.  Your post stuck out while I was reading.  Secure multi-sig is what we all want, but wanting apparently isn't enough to make it happen.
Other random notes from reading this 50+ post thread:
Perhaps we should have a config flag to prevent a node from serving IBD to new nodes.  IBD crushes marginal machines, particularly those with spinning disks.  This has been extensively discussed elsewhere.
The ideal IBD hosts are serving the blockchain out of a RAM disk. Is there any interest in setting up a network of volunteers to host expensive servers with fast connections?  It doesn't look too terribly difficult to figure out when a node has stopped asking for blocks in bulk, so we could add another config flag to eject nodes once they are done booting.
Even ignoring IBD, I think that we are gradually outgrowing cheapass hosting options.  Personally, I long ago gave up on answering forum questions about running nodes on virtual servers and VPSs.  It is certainly still possible to run bitcoind on small boxes, but it isn't trivial any more.  (Anyone running on less than my Athlon XP 1800+ with 896 MB RAM?)  If we want those nodes back, we need to optimize the hell out of the memory use, and even that might not be enough.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] ASIC-proof mining 
Just some general comments on this topic/discussion.
I suspect that there exist no algorithms which cannot be done better in an application-specific device than in a general purpose computer.  And if there is such a thing, then it must necessarily perform best on one specific platform, making that platform the de facto application specific device.
I'm not sure how one would go about proving or disproving that, but it seems very likely to be true.
IO-bound is exactly the same as memory bound, for devices that have enough memory.  20 GB is already trivial today, and you don't really get into ask-the-wife-for-permission money until you cross 128 GB. The exception would be if the IO was to an oracle outside of the device's control, and artificially limited in throughput.  Such a centralized oracle would be contrary to the goals usually stated by people thinking about anti-ASIC designs, so there isn't much point.
Keeping the algorithm simple, and ASIC-easy, has one other advantage.  Just about anyone can sit down and design an ASIC for SHA, for example, leading to diversity in the marketplace.  A harder algorithm can still be made into an ASIC (or more generally into an ASD), but will require more skilled designers, more expensive fabrication, etc.  This actually concentrates the ASIC advantage into the hands of fewer people, which again, is contrary to the stated goals.

I was trying to use bip10 for multisig and coinjoin, but there was a problem with it.  I'll have to look back at my notes, but I thought I sent you a message about it. And then real life swallowed my bitcoin time...
I think the bottom line was that it would be useful in the generic case with just one minor change.  If there is interest, and it sounds like there just may be, I can dust off my notes and see where I left it.  Probably should do it soon before someone implements it in PB or XML.

Decentralized doesn't mean "everyone is doing it", it means "no one can stop you from doing it".  Observe bitcoin development.  A few people do the bulk of the work, a bunch more people (like me) do work ranging from minor to trivial, and millions do nothing.  And yet, it is still totally decentralized because no one can stop anyone from making whatever changes they want.
So it is also with mining.  The world overall may make it impractical, perhaps even foolish, for you to fire up your CPU and mine solo, but no one is stopping you, and more to the point, no one is capable of stopping you.  There is no center from which you must ask permission.
On moderation, I note that moderation can also be done in a decentralized fashion.  I offer this long overdue example:

Multisig is great for irreversible actions, but pointless most of the time, which is why no PGP developer or user ever thought to implement it.
If you lose a key and an attacker signs a bogus email or commit with it, we all roll back with no lasting harm done.
