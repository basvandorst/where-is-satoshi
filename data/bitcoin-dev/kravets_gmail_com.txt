Hi guys,
This would be a big step forward.  Anecdotally I can report that <5% of *
non-nerds* who don't abandon Bitcoin after waiting for the initial
blockchain download and *ongoing* sync on every restart, end up using
blockchain.info simply because it just works and works on their iPads &
Conversely, all the serious nerds end up using Armory and/or Brainwallets
for ultimate control.

Hi Jim,
Guys, being a late comer/outsider (I got into bitcoin in early 2012), I can
tell you that this particular asylum is definitely run by its inmates.
What all the nerdy devs (and I am one so I know) seem unable to comprehend,
is that regular people out there don't wanna learn all this new stuff and
new terminology they simply have no attention span for it.
Simply channelling them to a decent client that
1. Just works (no blockchain downloads and no re-sync)
2. Allows to retain control of the private keys
Would be HUGE for mass adoption.
Old tired argument about "Bitcoin needs your nodes", so we'll channel you
to get bitcoin-qt client is both manipulative and unnecessary (there's
plenty of nodes and NAT'ed home nodes which don't mine are mostly useless
P.S. coinbase.com is just another trust-me setup takes your coins in
exchange for IOUs, whereas blockchain.info does let you to retain control
of your private keys.
P.P.S. The reason why coinbase has gotten so big is precisely because they
don't trouble regular lawyers and doctors with all the nonsense but simply
give them a
"buy" and a "sell" button.

Perhaps there should be two different sections on the web page.
Nerds  / Non-Nerds
With different recommendations for which clients to use.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] moving the default display to mbtc 
Hi guys,
I've seen many many non-geeks be utterly intimidated and confused by
0.000XXXXX quantities and/or mBTC & uBTC notation
Yes, $10 being rougnly 10,000 Won in South Korean is a great example where
large amounts of units work very well in a major economy.
FWIW,  I would prefer the entire switch-over be done *once* *and *at the
same time switching both BTC to XBT and using the following
Currency Code *: *XBT
Unit Definition  *: *1 Bit = 100 Satoshis
Addition benefit is splitting the term Bitcoin/bitcoin (as in Network and
currency unit) into Bitcoin (network) and Bit (the unit).
Perhaps this project/process should have a name and be listed on a road map
*BRCS: *Bitcoin Re-denomination and [Currency] Code Standardization project
Cheers ...

Hi Luca,
Please allow me to encourage your to follow the BIP workflow as specified
BIP Editor freely allocates BIP numberss, however that does not constitute
approval but allows for much easier discussion of and communication about
the proposal.
Good luck !
