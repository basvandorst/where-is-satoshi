@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Idea: More decimal places for lower minimum fee 
Currently, the minimum fee of 1 satoshi per byte corresponds to about 0.09 USD per kB, which is no longer insignificant. Maybe the time has come now to introduce more decimal places and make the minimum fee 1 of the new smallest unit. This way, everyday payments would again be possible with virtually no fee without flooding the mempool with free spam transactions.
