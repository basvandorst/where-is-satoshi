I would love to work with Netki. However, it's not clear to me what they
are selling. OpenAlias is an open standard, not a company. In contrast,
Netki have very long Terms of Service, that do not help understand what
part of their solution is open-source, and what is the product. They
surely know about OpenAlias, it would be nice to hear what they think
about it.

Hi there.  You are correct that we are a company providing a service,
however, that service is also based on an open standard which we are
proposing.  I'll be honest that we haven't done the greatest job in
promoting the standard so far.  More coming soon on that front.  Any
of the Open Source Wallet Name resolvers that we have created do
lookups against the standard record formats, and not directly against
our servers in any way.  Information on the record formats as well as
links to the lookup API server and some early libraries can be found
here:   and here:
To break it down briefly, we have an open lookup standard based on
both the namecoin blockchain as well as traditional DNSSEC.  (You can
choose your own adventure of using namecoin based names or traditional
ICANN names).  We DO provide a service where we will register or host
names on your behalf. However if you follow the format and host them
yourself, everything will work just fine, and our open source lookup
server and libraries will provide those results exactly the same as if
the names were hosted with us.  To that end, we have had conversations
with several companies in the space who intend to host their own
names, and we intend to work with them on the effort to ensure our
documentation is sufficient to ensure they can successfully do so.
In terms of comparisons to OpenAlias, I think there are a lot of
similarities, but a few differences.  First the similarities:
1> We both use DNSSEC.
2> We both have the option of storing the address directly in the DNS record.
1> We do not use DNSCrypt.  I understand why you chose to, but we were
concerned about broad interoperability and easy broad distribution of
hosting, so decided not to use it.  We have other ways of achieving
privacy, using HD Wallets and Payment Requests.
2> We have the option of storing a URL rather than just a wallet
address in the TXT record.  This allows a second level lookup against
the URL to get back a unique HD Wallet address or Payment Request each
time, further protecting user privacy and security.  Using Wallet
Names with Payment Requests allows for the user experience of typing
in an easy to remember name and getting back the "green lock" and who
the validated recipient is.  This also provides an auto audit of the
end to end DNS SEC process, in the case the path were somehow
compromised, the signature on the payment request can provide an
additional check.
3> We use a 2 tier lookup format.  The first lookup returns a list of
currencies or payment types supported by the Wallet Name.  The second
lookup goes to a record specific to that currency type to get the
address to go to.  We believe this to be a more scalable solution in a
world where someone can have both multiple digital currency types, but
then also multiple types of colored coins, and wants a simple way to
share a single name for all of those different addresses.  This allows
the wallet to do the work behind the scene of choosing the currency it
wants to send, and automatically getting back the right address to
send to, without the user having to do anything different.
4> We mandate DNSSEC while you make it optional.  We did this because
we believe giving the user the option of NOT using DNSSEC is like
letting them order a car with no brakes.  We weren't sure how we would
explain to them why their money was gone when they really didn't
understand the risks they were taking up front. We had a lot of
discussion about it before coming to the decision we did, and I can
see why you went the other way, although I do believe we made the
right choice.
Additionally, we just released another open source API server to help
with the "other half" of the lookup problem.  Its in its infancy, and
we are certainly taking feedback on it at this time.  It is called
Addressimo  and will serve
unique HD Wallet addresses or Payment Requests for every lookup, thus
allowing a user to have a private, secure way to share a Wallet Name
that can be used to send them any digital currency.
I'd love to talk here or offline about merging standards going
forward.  As an FYI, Verisign has also delivered a standard to the
IETF using DNSSEC to pass payment information here:
  We have
started discussions with them about merging standards as well.
They actually have a really nice way in their standard to encode email
addresses that more or less ensures that there won't be name space
collision in the case that there is already a record "joe.user.com"
and you want to create one for "joe at user.com" that we are looking at
adding to what we are doing in the next update to our record formats.
In any case, I'd much rather we had one effort going forward than
multiples, so let's talk!

I am breaking this into a couple of pieces as my first response has been in
a moderator queue for some time because it is too long.
TL;DR version - Wallet Name Service has always been a decentralized and
distributed service that it no way requires you to ever touch the Netki
infrastructure.  We want to work with the community, as we have been from
the beginning, to come up with the best standard possible.
Longer answers inline below.
believe the trade offs should be on perceived privacy versus censorship
resistance and centralization.
By having a limited number of proxies people need to go through to easily
implement, be it the 4 you recommend, or 53, you actually have a very
limited number of actors for an authority or hacker to go to in order to be
able to install/force logging, or censorship.  This very centralization
forces us back to a model where we need to trust a very small number of
actors in order for the system to operate as designed.  This, to me,
appears to be the opposite of the goals of the bitcoin ecosystem.  To
ensure this point is clear, I strongly believe recommending people focus
all lookups through 4 centralized "proxies" is a bad idea and counter to
bitcoin's ideals.
The fact that hackers or state actors need to corrupt only a small number
of servers/services in order to gain global visibility into all queries, I
believe, breaks any perceived privacy gains from using DNSCrypt.  A very
small number of hacks or subpoenas and everyone's records are fair game in
one place.
For the highly privacy conscious they can, today do their DNS lookups over
a non logging VPN connection without forcing everyone else through a
handful of centralized servers.  Or they can use DNSCrypt optionally
themselves.  All of our tools have always been open source and folks can
modify them for their own desired uses, or submit pull requests with their
own ideas.
We'd love to hear others thoughts on this.  While I believe that for now
the centralization trade offs required to use DNSCrypt today (via a limited
number of proxies) outweigh any perceived privacy benefits it provides, we
are always open to what others in the community believe and have made
modifications to how things work before as a result of feedback from
industry participants.
I think DANE is a great idea.  We were just discussing that with Andreas
S., and are currently looking at whether we want to add this as optional
versus mandatory, based on how widely available DANE is for folks using
services like Cloudflare, Akamai, etc for their DNS, which many providers
in the space today are.
Of course, the security conscious could setup DANE on the URL we use AS
IS.  There is no need to create a special kv pair for this as is done in
OpenAlias.  As you know, DNSSEC and HTTPS support this today out of the box.
The CA validation, in our case, is an ADDITIONAL signature based validation
to the DNSSEC chain, not a replacement for it.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Proposal: extend bip70 with OpenAlias 
We looked at doing this in a single lookup as you did.  With one or two
currencies this can be potentially more efficient.  As the number of
supported currencies and addresses under a single name grows, however, this
solution becomes potentially more problematic.  Please follow the use cases
Use case 1:  Wallet Name = "bob.foo.bar" or OpenAlias = "bob.foo.bar"
The only currency supported is bitcoin, and there are no colored coin
formats supported.
OpenAlias case:
1 packet lookup to "bob.foo.bar"
1 packet response with bitcoin address
= 2 packets
Wallet Name case:
1 packet lookup to "_wallet.bob.foo.bar"
1 packet response with supported address types
1 packet lookup to "_btc._wallet.bob.foo.bar"
1 packet response with bitcoin address
= 4 packets
Wallet Name Case 1a:
The wallet doing the lookup knows it wants bitcoin, so it skips the
supported addresses lookup
1 packet lookup to "_btc._wallet.bob.foo.bar"
1 packet response with bitcoin address
= 2 packets
In this use case we might create more traffic, but it could also be reduced
by doing smart lookups.
Use case 2:  Wallet Name = "bob.foo.bar" or OpenAlias = "bob.foo.bar"
Many currencies and colored coin addresses are supported under the same
name, lets say 100.  When you count different currencies and colored coin
types, it could easily be hundreds, or over a thousand.
OpenAlias case:
1 packet lookup to "bob.foo.bar"
100 packet responses with various addresses
= 101 packets
Wallet Name case:
1 packet lookup to "_wallet.bob.foo.bar"
1 packet response with supported address types
1 packet lookup to "_btc._wallet.bob.foo.bar"
1 packet response with bitcoin address
= 4 packets
Wallet Name Case 2a:
The wallet doing the lookup knows it wants bitcoin, so it skips the
supported addresses lookup
1 packet lookup to "_btc._wallet.bob.foo.bar"
1 packet response with bitcoin address
= 2 packets
While you may end doing "less lookups" under Open Alias, as it scales, you
end up causing a significant amount of extra, unnecessary traffic.
In addition to the obvious impact of being orders of magnitude more
wasteful than necessary, it also creates privacy "leakage" by returning
someone 100 different addresses when they only asked for one.
Finally, because a single packet UDP transaction for a DNS lookup can
create possibly hundreds of packets in response, the service can
essentially become an amplifier for DDoS attacks.  (If I spoof the source
address of my target with a query to a lookup that issues hundreds of
packets in response to one packet, and I can have a real impact :( )
I think this is a good point, and one we weighed.  When we were making our
original decisions.  Given the importance of ensuring that the lookups
return the correct value, and the known vulnerabilities in DNS without
DNSSEC, coupled with the fact that ICANN has mandated all zones and
registries move to DNSSEC, our belief was and is that it was worth the
trade off that there were cases where existing domains would not work.
It is important to note, that ICANN has "required" for some years that
registrars and registries support DNSSEC on the domains they register.  I
personally believe we shouldn't delay use of DNSSEC until their registries
had come up to current required Internet standards.  (Here are ICANN's
registrar requirements showing the DNSSEC requirement, btw:
That said, what do others in the industry think?  We are basing our current
standard on our believed best practices, and defaulted to "first, lose no
money", given the irreversibility of bitcoin.
I think "DNSSEC is hard" is a bit of a boogey man that's not really true.
We are working on developing registrar by registrar instructions of how to
do this, and we have typically found that if you are setting up DNS by
yourself, adding DNSSEC doesn't take a lot of additional time, maybe an
hour or so depending on your registrar.
This known concern, however, is why when we launched our product (based on
our standard record formats) that we wanted to launch it with a variety of
options for people.
In addition to these options there are also other hosting providers, and
certain registrars that will allow you to setup DNSSEC on their DNS

they can simply follow the formats on our developer page and do the whole
thing themselves.  If they do this by registering their own ".bit" this

That's some interesting data, and runs counter to the research of the IETF
DNS working group.  If you are willing to share your data, I can put you in
touch with the appropriate folks there to share your research.  I'd also
love to see it!
I'd argue that we aren't locking "huge portions" of the Internet.  You are
correct that about 15% of TLD's are not yet signed, even though they were
required to be by ICANN.
As I said above, I believe the requirement to not lose money and the fact
that other options are available for those running on TLD's that are out of
compliance, is worth the trade off that some existing names won't work
until their TLD's come into compliance with current Internet standards.
And, as we covered above, we don't force anyone to use our registrar, nor
any of our services in order for Wallet Names to work for them.  We never
have.  It's just not who we are.

These are actually vastly different pieces of software, at least from the
description, and a first read of the code.  My understanding is the
software you linked to here basically takes the DNS work out of lookups for
people, as we released:   Its
our Wallet Name Lookup server.
Addressimo, as I described above, provides a different purpose.  Its a way
for service providers, mobile wallet providers or end users to have an
online server that can serve unique wallet addresses ala HD Wallets (BIP32)
or signed Payment Requests (BIP0070).  This allows for an easy way to
increase security and privacy by serving a unique address for every
request, and/or sign the address (and other optional data) with an X509
private key to prove ownership of the address in a way independent of and
supplemental to the DNSSEC chain (also can be DANE for yet another layer of
security).  It also supports offline signing of the Payment Requests so the
server doesn't have to have access to a private key, or need to be trusted.
I'm a little confused by these closing statements.  Our system has, from
the beginning been open in terms of the fact that anyone could both serve
names or do lookups without ever touching our servers, talking to us, or us
even knowing that they did it or that they even exist.  Our system has
NEVER been one where folks were required to use us for any portion of the
service, and from our first beta product launch our open source tools did
all lookups against DNS records and the blockchain, never any proprietary
servers or interfaces on our side.
In terms of the format itself being open, we have already made several
extensions and modifications to it as a result of conversations with
industry participants in order to ensure that what we are building meets
the needs of the community at large.  We will gladly continue to do so, it
is how we ensure we are building something everyone needs!
I'd love to know where you got information that we were in some way a
closed and centralized system so that we can have an opportunity to clarify
that misconception.
In terms of finding a common standard, as I said, I am thrilled to have the
conversations, but there are some places, highlighted above, that would
cause me to hesitate to "just implement" the Open Alias standard.  I can
also see places where bringing the formats together to one standard could
have strong benefits, for example:
I think formatting the record as a key value pair with versioning has
merit, and would love to move it in to what we are doing (and likely will).
On the other side, I think the two level lookup provides a lot of value at
scale over trying to send back a bunch of text records when only a small
portion of the data is used.
I'd love to hear thoughts from others in the community on mandating DNSSEC
and thoughts on DNSCrypt.  I have a strong opinion on both of those but
would love to engage in thoughtful dialogue around what path best suits the
need of the community.
Looking forward to the discussion!

100% agreed.
To be clear, the current name of the service is Wallet Name Service,
Netki has tended to be tagged to it as people are associating the
service with us.  We also intend to offer more services than just
this, so its actually not really good for us to think of Netki as the
service name.  I have no issues with a neutral name for the lookup
You are the second person to raise this.  Clearly this is an item that
requires some discussion before anything is decided for sure.  We had
gone this direction (and I assume Riccardo did as well) to provide a
censor resistant option as well as one that would be low cost for
individuals to be able register their own names.  This also allows for
lookups that never leave the local network.  The trade off there for
mobile wallets was one I feel we failed to properly consider.
I think combining formats to use both the two level lookups and tags
could have value.  Tags could include information like versioning, as
well as whether what is being returned is an address, URL for further
lookup, or other piece of information.
I concur with this approach.  I think it makes sense for us to stay in
contact and communication with the IETF side with the hope of ending
up with something that is, in the end the same, or at least
compatible.  I also agree that we shouldn't wait on the IETF to move
ahead ourselves, more stay in communication with them so that we don't
end up accidentally going in opposite directions, and also so we can
learn best practices from each other along the way.
As you can see, this has been our approach up until now where we have
gone ahead and built and expanded our "standard" based on our
discussions and integrations with other industry participants.
Thanks for the feedback!

Hi Peter,
   Certainly AML/KYC compliance is one of the use cases that BIP 75 and our
certificates can support.  As a quick summary,
There are individuals and entities that would like to buy, sell, and use
bitcoin, and other public blockchains, but that have compliance
requirements that they need to meet before they can do so.  Similarly,
companies and entrepreneurs in the space suffer under the potential threat
of fines, or in extreme cases, jail time, also for not meeting AML or
sanctions list compliance.  We wanted to build tools that allowed
entrepreneurs to breathe easy, while at the same time allow more people and
companies to enter the ecosystem.  We also believe that the solution we are
using has the characteristics that you want in such a solution, for example:
1> Only the counterparties (and possibly their service providers in the
case of hosted services) in a transaction can see the identity data,
protecting user privacy.
2> The counterparties themselves (and possibly their service providers in
the case of hosted services) decide whether identity information is
required for any given transaction.
3> No trace is left on the blockchain or anywhere else (other than with the
counterparties) that identity information was even exchanged, protecting
4> The solution is based on open source and open standards, allowing open
permissionless innovation, versus parties building closed networks based on
closed standards.  The very fact that this solution went through the BIP
process and was adapted based on feedback is an example of how this is
better for users than the inevitable closed solution that would arise if
the open source, community vetted version didn?t already exist.
I don?t know if you are opposed to organizations that have AML requirements
from using the bitcoin blockchain, but if you aren?t, why wouldn?t you
prefer an open source, open standards based solution to exclusionary,
proprietary ones?
BIP 70 and BIP 75 are standards for voluntary information exchange between
counterparties in a transaction.  This is exactly the kind of thing we want
standards for, in my experience.

This was precisely our thinking as well.
This is actually exactly why BIP 75 was designed the way that it was.  Any
(voluntary) identity exchange is done at the application level, on an
encrypted https (or other) connection between the sender and receiver.
Identity data is not passed through or stored on the blockchain, and there
is actually no mark left on the blockchain that identity was even exchanged
on that transaction.
The only people who know identity info was exchanged, or what the identity
was is the counterparties in the transaction, and depending on
implementation, their service provider.  (At a high level, many software
based wallet providers wouldn?t have any visibility into identity info,
where many hosted services would, for example)
We did this to protect user privacy as well as fungibility.
We are allowing the people who want or need to exchange identtity info
(either self signed or 3rd party validated) the option to exchange it, in a
standards based way, directly between peers, without touching the
blockchain or network itself.
Is this more clear?

Hi there,
   For users who don?t wish a service provider to be able to see their
information, even ephemerally, and they would like to exchange information
via BIP75, they can use a software wallet, such as a breadwallet or others,
and that data will only exist on their phone, and the phone of their
counterparty (assuming the counterparty also chose to exchange info, and
was running on a software wallet).
In this way, we allow users to exchange data as they choose, without having
the risk that a service provider be asked for that data.
If a user chooses to use a hosted platform, and also to store their
identity data there, I do agree it could be subject to a subpoena, the same
as when they host their email, and other services.
Finally, they could choose not to use BIP75 at all, and no one would know
whether they did or didn?t (other than their counterparts) as we don?t
leave any residue on the blockchain, or anywhere else in the public eye.
We believe that this solution, due in part to its narrow data aperture, is
the best solution available to the problem we are solving.  We are eager to
engage in any discussions about how to improve the proposed solution, with
an eye to fungibility, privacy, and usability.
That said, there is a real need for people to know who they are transacting
with for usability reasons, for fraud reduction, and also of regulatory
reasons for some players.  To NOT solve it with a carefully crafted
standard means that it is more likely to be solved with back room, quick
and dirty solutions that are not available for community review and

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Proposed BIP extension to BIP 0070 
The following draft BIP proposes an update to the Payment Protocol.
The motivation for defining this extension to the BIP70 Payment Protocol is
to allow 2 parties to exchange payment information in a permissioned and
encrypted way such that wallet address communication can become a more
automated process. Additionally, this extension allows for the requestor of
a PaymentRequest to supply a certificate and signature in order to
facilitate identification for address release. This also allows
for automated creation of off blockchain transaction logs that are human
readable, containing who you transacted with, in addition to the
information that it contains today.
The motivation for this extension to BIP70 is threefold:
1. Ensure that the payment details can only be seen by the participants in
the transaction, and not by any third party.
2. Enhance the Payment Protocol to allow for store and forward servers in
order to allow, for example, mobile wallets to sign and serve
Payment Requests.
3. Allow a sender of funds the option of sharing their identity with the
receiver. This information could then be used to:
        * Make bitcoin logs more human readable
        * Give the user the ability to decide who to release payment
details to
        * Allow an entity such as a political campaign to ensure donors
match regulatory and legal requirements
        * Allow for an open standards based way for regulated financial
entities to meet regulatory requirements
        * Automate the active exchange of payment addresses, so static
addresses and BIP32 X-Pubs can be avoided to maintain privacy
and convenience
In short we wanted to make bitcoin more human, while at the same time
improving transaction privacy.
Full proposal here:
We look forward to your thoughts and feedback on this proposal!

I think we would be open to either leaving them in, or doing a separate
BIP.  What do others think?  I?d prefer to keep them together if the
changes are non-controversial just to cut down on  BIP?s, but thats not
a strong preference.
