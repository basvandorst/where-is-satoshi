This is not a good solution. In UX colors have expected meaning. Red often means error, yellow cation, green possible, etc... Text doesn?t have good legibility in colors, monochrome high contrast being the best.
You will also have issues with colorblind people.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP 174 thoughts 
Hello Folks,
Thanks for expediting this debate, I understand some still disagree about how this final spec should look like.
1. Coldcard's plugin for Electrum using the original BIP spec is ready,  2. Our hardware is ready with this spec (src will be public soon)
3. Samourai Wallet and Sentinel also are ready with the current spec.
We intend to upgrade it once the final spec is ready, but I need to ship Coldcard.

We are planning on implementing the [Deterministic Entropy From BIP32 Keychains]( BIP on Coldcard.
Is there a BIP number planned to be assigned and is there any review of this BIP yet?
