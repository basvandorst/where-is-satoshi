@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP171 - Mocked implementation, generated specs, 
I just released CERISE (website  & github
) a project with the following
artifacts :
   -
   A mocked server implementation to start developing clients :
      -
   A live & documented API to understand and directly calls the methods :
      -
   Specifications of the four methods : Enumerating supported currency-pair
   tokens
   , Currency-pair information
   , Current exchange rate
    & Historical exchange rates
   .
   -
   16 client librairies for various langages (Java, PHP, c++, Rusty,
   Ruby?.) :    -
   and i?m working on a template project to allow developers to quickly
   build a BIP171 compliant server without having to worrying about parameters
   validation, security, rest mechanics? will be done in september.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP171 - Specs, Mock server, 
I worked on the BIP 171
 and I
created Cerise  (github
) that provides the following artifacts
   - BIP-0171 specifications .
   - A mocked BIP-0171 compliant server available online
    you can use to understand the
   API and make calls.
   - A mocked BIP-0171 compliant server as a Java application
    you can use to develop
   your client application.
   - A mocked BIP-0171 compliant server as a Docker image
    you can use to
   develop your client application.
   - A BIP-0171 library  to transform
   your application in a BIP-0171 server.
   - A server template project
    to quickly write
   your implementation and automatically produce your BIP-0171 server.
   - A collection of client libraries  to
   call any BIP-0171 compliant server with your favorite language.
I made some proposal of evolutions here :
I hope it helps and if you have any suggestion on how I could help more,
let me know.
