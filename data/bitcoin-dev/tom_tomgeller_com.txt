@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Procedure for non-tech contributions 
Hey, folks. Sorry if this is documented somewhere -- if so, just point me at it. I couldn't find it, though.
I'm a (non-developer) writer with experience in open-source communities, and I'd like to contribute with writing/editing/marketing. What's the procedure? Is there someone in charge of that area?
Two examples:
1) Gavin recently asked for proofreading of 0.9.0rc2, but it was unclear how to send the changes. (There are many possibilities, some better than others. Git? Google Docs with revisioning? Microsoft Word with Track Changes? The Bitcoin wiki?)
2) The page at  says that "the wiki receiving wallet (for the wiki itself) is also MtGox". Umm, I rather doubt that. :-P But I'm not sure what the current info is, or whom to alert.
Off-list replies welcome. Thanks,

Drak responded:
Ooo, I like this. I *can* use git, but would love to be able to avoid it -- as would most non-technical contributors.
Anyway, this particular solution doesn't appear to be possible in this case, as the file isn't at  , and I don't believe I could copy it to the repository without going the whole git route. Suggestions welcome, here or privately.
The foolishness of sending a payment to a Mt. Gox-held wallet -- which is required to edit the wiki -- strikes me as a pressing issue. If I understand it correctly, this is a hard blocker that'll stop *all* new contributors. Further, I registered for the wiki and never got my confirmation email. Methinks the whole thing is broken. :(
Again, please to redirect me if this is inappropriate for this list. (I'm new here.) Cheers,

Thanks to everyone with advice re: editing text on github, and Mt. Gox' control of the wiki. Regarding the latter, "SerajewelKS" and "gmaxwell" in IRC/bitcoin confirmed that fixes are underway, but didn't give specifics. I'll wait.
Regarding text editing, special thanks to Wladimir for the simplest solution:
I'll try to make time to go over the 0.9.0rc2 text soon. Cheers,

It failed testing. I assume I'll get emails as others add comments; please contact me privately if it doesn't, and you're willing to help this n00b. Thanks,           Tom Geller  *  Oberlin, Ohio  *  415-317-1805

Just an FYI: The Bitcoin wiki ( is down.
Is there a communication procedure or point person for such things?
