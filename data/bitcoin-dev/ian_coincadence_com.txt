@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] LockUnspent not working, bug? 
My first post to the list, not sure this is the right place, let me know if it is better to open an issue on GitHub.
This is occurring on OS X with Satoshi 0.11.0, the TXID and vout belong to the wallet:
command: lockunspent true "[ { \"txid\": \"fd697746c67f68a206bb7377fd40f35d146cc5821883e4c4b6cbf82b48e62a13\", \"vout\": 1 } ]"
output: true
command: listlockunspent
Additionally after locking the TX with lockunspent I am able to spend it from the wallet.
