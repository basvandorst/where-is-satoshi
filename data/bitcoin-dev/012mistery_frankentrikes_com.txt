@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Why not archive the backend of Bitcoin blockchain? 
On 3/17/18, someone posted on the Lightning-dev list, "Can I try Lightning without running a fully-fledged bitcoin block chain? (Yubin Ruan)."? The inquirer was asking because he didn't have much space to store the entire blockchain on his laptop.
I replied:
On THIS note and slightly off-topic but relevant, why can't chunks of blockchain peel off the backend periodically and be archived, say on minimum of 150 computers across 7 continents?
It seems crazy to continue adding on to an increasingly long chain to infinity if the old chapters (i.e. more than, say, 2 years old) could be stored in an evenly distributed manner across the planet. The same 150 computers would not need to store every chapter either, just the index would need to be widely distributed in order to reconnect with a chapter if needed. Then maybe it is no longer a limitation in the future for people like Yubin. "
It was suggested by a couple of lightning developers that I post this idea on the bitcoin-dev list.? So, here I post :).
