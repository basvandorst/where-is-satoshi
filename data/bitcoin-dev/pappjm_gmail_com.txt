My understanding of the paper is that the blinding factor would be included in the extra data which is incorporated into the ring signatures used in the range proof.
Although, since I think the range proof is optional for single output transactions (or at least, one output per transaction doesn't require a range proof since there's only one possible value that it can be to make the whole thing work, and that value must be in range, I'm not entirely sure how you'd transmit it then, though in any case, since using it will pretty much require segwit, adding extraneous data isn't much of a problem.  In both cases, I imagine the blinding factor would be protected from outside examination via some form of shared secret generation... Although that would require the sender to know the recipient's unhashed public key; I don't know of any shared secret schemes that will work on hashed keys.

ECC doesn't work like RSA; you can't encrypt directly with a public key.  That's why you generate a shared secret between sender and receiver.  See also, ECDH. (Basically, if (m, M = m*G) is your private/public key pair, and (n, N = n*G) is your recipient's private public key pair, you can both generate shared secret S = m*N = n*M = m*n*G without revealing your private keys to each other, and without revealing the secret to anyone else as long as they don't know either private key. You then use S as the basis for the key to some symmetric Normal Bitcoin transactions are made to the hash of a public key because once the public key is known, it becomes easier to break it if we ever develop quantum computers. That's why it's recommended that you only spend from a particular address once (if possible) since its only in spending that you are required to reveal your public key.   Since you can't do a shared secret with a public key hash, AFAIK, you'd have to know the public key of your recipient to be able to do ECDH.
