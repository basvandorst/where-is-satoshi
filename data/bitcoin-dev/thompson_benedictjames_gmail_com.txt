@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Full node "tip" function 
I feel like this would be pointless as the vast majority of users would
likely download the blockchain from a node that was not enforcing a tip
requirement as it would seem like unnecessary cost as in protocol?s such as
BitTorrent there is no such tips in sharing files and the blockchain
distribution is in eccense the same thing. However perhaps I am
underestimating the generosity of node operators but I feel that adding a
cost to the blockchain (assuming that all users add a tip requirement)
would lead to centralisation.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Visually Differentiable - Bitcoin Addresses 
Checking the first few bytes of a Bitcoin Address should not be considered
sufficient for ensuring that it is correct as it takes less than a second
to generate a 3 character vanity address that matches the first 3
characters of an address.

The last few bytes can be generated to be the same also.
