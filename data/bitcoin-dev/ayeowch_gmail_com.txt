@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Missing fRelayTxes in version message 
I personally don't treat the relay field as optional, i.e. it is there as
0x01 if it is set. Otherwise, it is simply a trailing zero byte. Hence, the
right way of reading the packet as with any network packet is to first
retrieve the header information, get the actual payload length, then parse
the payload accordingly. I can also choose to include 0x00 for my relay
field in my outgoing packet and reflect that accordingly in my length field
in the header.

relay field (bool/1 byte) required in all version packets coming from
client with protocol version >= 70001?

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] 32 vs 64-bit timestamp fields 
Hi list,
Can someone explain why do we have 32-bit and 64-bit timestamp fields
instead of all being 64-bit?

Do we know for certain or at least a rough figure of the node count in
the network?

Is the number representing the count for the client nodes?
I was curious of the count myself earlier this week and started to
traverse down the network using getaddr message starting from seed
nodes and found upward to 57k nodes running protocol >= 70001 with
timestamp no older than 24 hours.

Hi Mike,
I am glad you are still following up with Bitnodes. The recent spike in
nodes count should probably be taken with a grain of salt; run  (
 does appear artificial to me, i.e.
potentially bogus nodes being added. I am still working on a more in depth
analysis on the data.
There are quite some TODOs for the project at the moment for the next
couple of months. I have included propagation data as well into the list.

I believe the requests Jeff is seeing came from my crawler although anyone
could be running it ( since there is no
IP address in the log to confirm the source of the requests.
This is a sample log of an actual request from my crawler at 148.251.238.178
*2014-07-30 22:43:54 receive version message: /getaddr.bitnodes.io:0.1/:
version 70001, blocks=313244, us=X.X.X.X:8333, them=0.0.0.0:0
, peer=148.251.238.178:47635*
Currently, the crawler takes a full snapshot of the network of reachable
nodes as soon as it is done with previous snapshot. I want to be able to
diff between the snapshots to get the join and leave nodes periodically.
Each full snapshot is taken on average between 3 to 4 minutes hence the
requests that you see from the crawler every 3 to 4 minutes.
I have a task in my schedule (
 to improve
upon this method by skipping a new connection with currently reachable
nodes while still being able to perform the diff.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Sudden temporary drop in reachable nodes? 
Hi Mike,
That was because I had to restart the crawler for update. This disconnects
the crawler from all reachable nodes temporarily and it will take about 15
minutes (3 snapshots) before the crawler stabilize again. I will look into
annotating these drops with a note.
