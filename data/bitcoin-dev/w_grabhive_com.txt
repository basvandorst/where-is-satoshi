For usability purposes, we at Hive would like to have an auto-updater in our wallet app.
What is a safe way to do this? I understand that Bitcoin-QT lacks such an updater for security reasons... Has been thought out in more detail since that decision was made?
We have been toying around with the idea of placing one server behind a Tor hidden service, whose only function is to output a checksum of the update package. The theory is that if it is well-secured, it will at least be immune to tampering at the physical hosting level.
Any thoughts or advice about any of this?

Thanks very much indeed everyone, this is all very helpful. Much to research and think about.
Interestingly, a thread is presently raging on liberationtech about Tor Browser Bundle, and the subject of automatic updates has come up. Gregory Maxwell responded thusly (cross-posting for completeness):

To those of you in the know about modern browser tech:
Does it seem at all conceivable that an SPV wallet could be built entirely in JavaScript? And if indeed it is within the realm of the possible, how would such a thing be safely distributed for use? Would a signed Chrome Plugin be an ideal vehicle?

We have been discussing something like this over here too, as well as exploring more esoteric blockchain+signature-based "SSO" implementations as discussed by John Light and others.
One of our long-term ambitions with Hive is to provide a (mostly) user-transparent, decentralized authentication service. It sounds like our infrastructure could already handle a Persona implementation, and we very much want to get behind some forward-thinking standard. So as long as the plan _IS_ to remove said 'centralized struts' at the appropriate time, I'd say we're interested in exploring this further.

Right, I'm not suggesting that we have this wallet in a web app, but rather precisely what you are talking about: using special browser features, and bundling it. I am fundamentally monoculture-opposed, but given Chrome's present installed base, that initial target makes sense to me, provided that we could have a one-click installation (as per normal, via the Chrome Store).
Chrome also has this "Native Client" plug-in: I know next to nothing about it, and this goes off the rails of the Subject, but perhaps an SPV implementation there could be a solution to the concerns you expressed?

"Packaged app pages always load locally. This allows apps to be less dependent on the network. Once a user installs an app, they have full control over the app's lifecycle. Apps open and close quickly, and the system can shut apps down at any time to improve performance. Users can fully uninstall apps."
Does this mean that upon install, a nice, icon-emblazoned package will drop into my /Applications folder on a Mac, or in my Windows Start menu, etc... Or are packaged apps always launched and maintained from within Chrome itself?
Provided that the technical stuff could be made to work within the context of the more limited API, this certainly seems like an interesting, user-friendly way to distribute a Bitcoin wallet!

I for one support your rallying cry of decentralization.
If you are implying that even 10,000 full nodes seems far, far too few for a distributed system that may ultimately face a very well-connected and well-funded threat model, I agree with you completely. However, I took Gavin's statement to mean something like a factual statement about the load-bearing nature of that many nodes, rather than an actual target number for some future iteration of the network.
Partial UTXO sets sound like a great idea -- are they really being ignored? I am pretty new to the development process here, but I assumed (as with many open source projects) that ideation, debate and implementation take a while to churn. Has a prototype of that been developed already, are you implying that you funded something like that and it never got built? If there are some GitHub links that I missed, please send them over.
Maybe you should open that topic back up in its own thread, so we can bring it back into view?

Hi devs,
Just wanted to cross-post this here since it seems very relevant.
We're launching BitcoinKit.framework, a Cocoa framework that allows developers to write Bitcoin wallet apps for Mac OS X. BitcoinKit uses bitcoind, and serves a small and tidy API for developer use. Support for other Bitcoin implementations (libcbitcoin, etc) is soon to follow.
BitcoinKit's first application is as the backbone of a new Mac wallet app called Hive, which will be released soon at Grab the source here:
Support is available via GitHub issues and this Bitcointalk thread:
A sample GUI app is also included:

Hi Mike,
You are absolutely right about the synchronize time, it's one of our main frustration points right now and we clearly won't deliver the kind of user experience we want, without fixing this. Actually we were thinking of extending Jeff Garzik's picocoin as time permits, but the plan is far from concrete at the moment.
What you say about trans-piling bitcoinj is _really_ appealing. We discounted Java simply because an OS X JVM is no longer guaranteed, but otherwise bitcoinj is ideal for our purposes. How can we assist or otherwise accelerate such an effort?

I for one would be interested in taking a look at that.
In San Jose I was asking around about the possibility of hiring someone to complete such a patch. Pieter Wuille introduced me to Eric Lombrozo, who expressed interest, but has since gotten quite busy. So we haven't arrived at a detailed estimate of what it would involve.
Maybe it would be better to start a completely new thread for this topic, but I would very much be interested in an open dissection of what adding SPV support to bitcoind would take. I am willing to fund or (ideally) co-fund this endeavor, if I can ever get my head around it. I'm super interested in all of these possibilities (including micro-stripped-VMs and transpilation), but would simply like to encourage the proliferation of _options_ whenever possible.

Hello everyone,
In the previous thread, I expressed interest in seeing an SPV bitcoind, further stating that I would fund such work. Mike Hearn followed up with some of Satoshi's old code for this, which is now quite broken. The offer and interest on my side still stand, as more diversity in SPV options seems like the right way to go.
Time-permitting, I would really appreciate feedback from knowledgable parties about the possible approaches to an SPV bitcoind. We at Hive ideally want to see something that could one be merge into master, rather than a fork.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] An "app store" and non-network transaction 
Hi everyone,
Our OS X wallet "Hive" features an integrated application platform. We hope this will be a great way for folks new to Bitcoin to discover a variety of Bitcoin businesses, from exchanges, to merchants, to games. The applications are locally hosted HTML/JS, and generally feature the most stripped-down UIs possible. We display them in a mobile-proportioned WebKit frame inside of Hive itself. Transaction requests within apps trigger native Cocoa dialogue boxes and everything feels nicely integrated and secure.
Should Hive succeed in gaining a foothold, we hope that we may one day be able to sustain ourselves via an aggregate of very small fees on transactions within this app platform. We like the approach because it lets us stay focused on making Hive great, and keeping it free, but at the same time we recognize that it is a kind of obligatory middleman... With all that that implies? I'm not totally sure, and that's what the question is about.
Obviously there are a couple of brain-dead approaches: We could track what users do in the app, and send the business a bill (with blockchain proof, of course). Or, we could avoid troubling the business and have each user send a micro-transaction to some address of our choosing. The first one is messy and essentially makes us spyware. The second one is technically difficult, making a mess of transaction history, balances, and possibly in-app price listings. I'm not happy with either, but would lean towards the second one if I had to choose.
I'm not 100% sure if this is the appropriate venue for it, but before we make that decision, I wanted to state our intentions and see if I could get some fresher ideas in the door. We want to be as ethical and (ideally) decentralized as possible -- priorities  and  -- but are otherwise open-minded.
Some technical details for the curious:
1) Yes, everything will be free software under a GPL license -- including the app store and the apps themselves! That may seem to be risky given our proposed business model, but we are open-minded and think we very much welcome the 'competition' of a would-be forker / hope we can work together. ;-)
2) Although our BitcoinKit.framework supports both bitcoind and bitcoinj, we will be using bitcoinj with an integrated VM for the time being. The main draw is SPV, although to be honest we would prefer to support the network more via something like Peter Todd's partial UTXO sets idea (hint hint, anyone?).
We will be at the conference in Amsterdam on the 27th of this month if any of you want to meet and discuss.
Thanks for your time,

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Social network integration (brainstorm) 
Mike Hearn had a rather cool idea about watermarking images with Bitcoin addresses in order to facilitate auto-magically linking social networking profiles: apparently even without API access, reasonably large user images are available publicly via the major services (Facebook, Twitter).
Since this process would necessarily be somewhat manual and would of course be "undone" anytime the user changed his/her profile image, it is probably not a solution for everyone. But it seems that this could be a helpful way to at least _begin_ organizing Bitcoin around people and organizations in a way that is broadly familiar.
I haven't been able to get this to work myself, but Blockchain.info seems to offer sending 'coin via Facebook:
There is also the very cute Bitcoins With Friends:
Most of the other apps that I have seen at one point or another have vanished. I recall reading that Facebook was not particularly friendly to them, hence the present interest in more subversive (?) ways of making those connections.
Again, I am not 100% sure that this is the correct place for it, but I'm opening this thread to other such ideas in case anyone else wants to discuss it. Our motivation is making Bitcoin easier to use, and we suspect that even imperfect social network support will move us closer to that goal.

Hey Mike!
In the long term, I think this makes perfect sense. After all, that's really what the first option is at its heart. About search engines, that's also a great point. We've thought about doing this, but my concern was that the ecosystem on the whole is too young and fragmented for this to make much sense. Until for example speciality search engines for Bitcoin products and services manifest (I'm sure they are coming), I suspect the results might be a little vague and unsatisfying.
I really see Hive's app platform as a stepping-stone to more mature things. Hopefully several companies like BitPay end up offering both great affiliate programs and search engines very soon. Until then, that's why something like sending transaction fees directly from the user's wallet is even on the table.
Yes, I should clarify. We do want businesses to be able to have that control. However we also want to do a kind of submission/review process in order to ensure some user experience continuity and also to monitor for potential exploits. The plan is ultimately to have a public repository for applications, maintained by us. We will review the pull requests of third parties and the Hive app will always try to pull the latest (approved) updates. Does that make sense? It's centralized responsibility and potential risk if we cannot keep up with demand, but again -- we want to try the approach, at least while starting out.
That's absolutely true, but at the moment the only thing I can really say is that we'll cross that bridge when we get there. ;-)
Funny you should mention it! I just mocked this idea up last week, though I assumed a cruder system of "voting" to an address that corresponds to a feature -- literally, voting with your wallet (for your wallet, ad infinitum). I watched your talk about assurance contracts and other "hidden" features, but am not entirely sure that I understood it enough to know how it would work in this context. Sorry for the persistent hand-holding requests, but some advice would be very welcome.
If it is a real burden for the users, that's the best argument I've yet heard. However, my impression from Peter's post was that it would be fairly painless for them. I guess there's also the question of diminishing returns: Is the network value of a full "user" Bitcoin node less than one run on a dedicated server? Will it eventually be? I don't know enough about that to comment, but I do know that in the Tor example, exits are chosen based on some criteria (I think, available bandwidth?). Is there a parallel in Bitcoin?
(Probably best as a separate thread...)
Thanks for your thoughts, Mike.

Well, let's assume that our "public good" is based on the 5-step model described here:
This good corresponds to something like "Facebook contact synchronization" and has a target of 50 BTC, though we also want to be able to take more if people are willing to give it.
From here, it is unfortunately a little over our collective heads; we have as of yet no experience with the scripting language. I suppose I'm trying to twist your arm for an example, and maybe an anecdote. How would we do it? Does it require the donors to do anything esoteric? I saw "but they do not broadcast it" -- does this happen automatically when coins are sent to that address, for example?

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Simple contacts exchange (was: Social network 
Hi all,
We're thinking about ways of automatically exchanging contact details between wallets, in order to encourage the proliferation of identifiable names and photos rather than long and hard-to-verify addresses.
The simplest version goes like this:
2 BTC Bitcoin is sent to someone, and a data lookup hash is inserted into the transaction. When it arrives on the other end, it is indeed looked up, and instead of being presented with a dialogue that says "you received 2 BTC from 13Y94z43Nbbb6wevRyk82CeDoYQ5S28zmA", it's "You received 2 BTC from Frank Jones" including a nice photo.
Now. We can simply delete this data in reference to the transaction ID after it happens (or delete it after a time), but is there any more decentralized way to do it? I would prefer us to run no dedicated servers that would ever put us in a position of being coerced into giving data, or otherwise altering our system to store it.
Any thoughts about this?

Luke pointed out that we should not be inserting extraneous data into the blockchain, so this sounds like the best option, Eric. I'm under the impression that a Bitcoin user Alice cannot see the actual public key of Bitcoin user Bob, so if we had Hive store metadata on a server relating to a given transaction ID, I would not be able to use those public keys key to encrypt. Is this a misunderstanding or is it correct?
Assuming it is correct, the best that I could come up with was storing the transaction ID with a _fresh_ public key on a server, each time a transfer is made. Altogether it looks like this:
- Alice generates a new keypair & revocation certificate for the transaction
- Alice makes a Bitcoin transaction to Bob
- Alice sends the transaction ID plus the new public key to server
- Bob receives the Bitcoin transaction
- Bob generates a new keypair & revocation certificate
- Bob does a transaction ID lookup on the server, receives Alice's public key, sends his own new one
- Bob encrypts his user metadata against Alice's new key
- Alice downloads and decrypts Bob's metadata
- Alice uploads her revocation certificate
- Alice uploads her own metadata
- Bob downloads Alice's metadata
- Bob uploads his revocation certificate
- (Server removes all keys with revocation certificates)
I presume going the extra mile to generate new keys for each transaction is helpful for privacy?
The above seems rather inelegant to me. I really don't like that clients (wallets) are going to be beating down the server all the time checking for keys, or that there is a possibility of a desynchronization so severe that the user receives the data much too late for it to be useful. But, I suppose it can work.
Another thing I'm considering is Alice/Bob validating each other. I suppose we should include some kind of code that we encourage people to read to each other over the phone or some other medium, to ensure that "it really is Alice", before (for example) returning money to a very legit-looking personage.
Any other thoughts? I would love to do this without using any servers at all ("serverless keyserver", anyone?), but I am not quite sure how.

Couple of things I just thought about:
1- Presume server should only sweep with two (or more, see below) revocation certificates being present
2- Need to insert something in the flow so that Alice can verify that the uploaded key is actually Bob's (and perhaps vise-versa, given an extremely dedicated attacker with a fast connection?).
Is there a way to do  without creating yet another transaction? Admittedly I am still really puzzled about the accessibility of public keys in Bitcoin!
Please remember that the idea is to have two wallets securely exchange a packet of metadata about a transaction beyond the scope of Bitcoin itself (a name, perhaps a small photo, etc) in order to increase usability. This will be my last post here on the topic except to reply in case anyone else contributes.

Thanks Mike.
I definitely took all your comments to heart, but we're looking to road-test something quickly for the sake of user experience in our own wallet. I wouldn't mind us contributing to a BIP once we have a better grip on the payment protocol itself, but (for example) I'm still not sure that I understand _why_ signed certificates are even required. Isn't that likely be an obstacle to adoption for use cases like this?
