@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] BitCoin and MinorFs/AppArmor 
My efforts on MinorFs2 have been stalled for a large period of time
(resulting from the fact that I was writing it in Python and Google
pulling the plug on its codesearch server showed me that Python was a
language that I hadn't sufficiently mastered. Recently, after almost a
year of reluctance at starting from scratch, I finaly set myself to
rewriting what I had done so far in C++ and to continue development.
Yesterday I've also started at a library for making the usage of MinorFs
by applications like Bitcoin more convenient. The idea is that LibMinorFs
will become a simple to use library for making applications
I would like to ask if the bitcoin developers would be open to using
this library within bitcoin for making BitCoin MinorFs2 aware, allowing it
to store things like the BitCoin purse in a private directory that is not
available to other unrelated (potentially trojan) processes running under
the same uid.
The API is defined in the inc/minorfs/ directory and the usage shown in
Both the library and the filesystems are still far from being done, but I
would like to know if you guys would be open to a pull-request that would
incorporate a copy of this library into Bitcoin, making BitCoin use
private storage when available, implemented using the above API.
Please let me know what you think.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Review for slides for "defeating trojans" talk 
Completed the first draft of my slides+speaker-notes for my upcoming
"Defeating Trojans" talk at the OHM2013. BitCoin is one of the main
examples I use in this talk to emphasize the need for programs like
BitCoin to have
their own private storage apart from $HOME.
To make sure I don't misrepresent BitCoin, could anyone here help me out
by reviewing my slides,  please let me know and I'll e-mail my (open
office) slides to you for review.
