@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Okay, time to bring up bitcoin/bitcoin 
I've sat on this for some time after starting this.  I have forked this from bitcoin core and am working on a secure tax "mode" for bitcoin.  It is written in Autoit.  I know I know, scripting language alert!  I would like people to look at:
Look at it, and let's have an open dialog about it.  I want to know the good, the bad, and the ugly!

As far as choice of U R L, it may be a poor choice but I did this because I wanted it connected with the core.  As far as fishing it certainly is not that!  This is a serious project.

I tell you that this is a serious project for bitcoin.  You are free to assume the worst.  After all, I did say the good the bad and the ugly would come out of this.  I happen to be a big believer in bitcoin and I feel this project holds water.  If you disagree, that's fine.

I understand now why someone thought I was fishing.  That link should work just fine...I'm not sure what the problem is as I know I forked correctly.  I guess I'll need to register a domain for it an get a page going and link from there.  I just haven't gotten around to it but will do that.  I'll get going!  Just know that I would never set up fishing; that's not my style.

Thank you for giving me the benifit of the doubt.  I did not realize my mistake.  I hope we can now get back to talking about bitcoin

I was trying to point you to that.  I am embarrassed.

I personally like the ida.  Are you talking about a flag that could toggle this "in the background" mode or recoding for in the background use?

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Warning message when running wallet in 
I think we should get to the bottom of this.  Should we assume that xp is not secure enough?  What is this warning?  Who is issuing this warning?

Should we then add an alert message to wallet installers such as, "Such and such will not run on windows xp?"

Okay, so we simply stop supporting it.  Should bitcoin pull support

Okay, so how about an autoupdate function which pulls a work around off the server?  Sooner or later, the vulnerabilities must be faced.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Coinbase reallocation to discourage 
I have some questions:
1.  How can we work towards solving the double-spending problem?
2.  Is it possible to "scan" for double-spending and correct it?
3.  Is the network at large not secure enough?

This all sounds verry restrictive.  Is it possible to do a "sweep" in order to "clean up" double spending?  Why punish miners for the sake of punishing them?

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Lets discuss what to do if SHA256d is 
It is good to start thinking about such things.  Let's face it, it could happen.  However, short of having bitcoin use another algorithm for encryption, I am not sure much could be done.  That's just me.
