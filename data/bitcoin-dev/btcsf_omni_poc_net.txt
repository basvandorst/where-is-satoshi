@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Abnormally Large Tor node accepting only 
It's not quite accurate that the Tor node's throughput is 'mostly'
plaintext Bitcoin traffic. The node will only exit bitcoin traffic (or
anything else on port 8333) but most of the bandwidth is probably used
in being a Tor relay where there can be no port number discrimination.
However by providing so much bandwidth to the Tor network (maybe
record-setting?) and providing exit service for 8333, the node puts
itself in a strong position to do any or all of the following:
(a) Observe a lot of Bitcoin traffic from users connecting with Tor.
(b) Tamper with said traffic in some way.
(c) Hide the administrator's self-generated Bitcoin traffic in a crowd
of other Bitcoin traffic emitting from the same IP address.
Any of those possibilties might be intriguing.
