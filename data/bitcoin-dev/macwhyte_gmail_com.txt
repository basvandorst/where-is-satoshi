(including fee management) and just use bitcoind to send, receive, and
verify transactions. It's not meant to be a drop-in solution for running an
entire bitcoin deposit and withdrawal system, it just provides the bare
tools required to build your own. If you need a pre-built solution, there
are companies that provide those types of services as a platform (BitGo,
for example).

I'm talking about services that are built to handle multiple accounts, like
exchanges and payment processors.
No, you don't. You can write a script that repeatedly asks bitcoind for the
block height, and when it increments you know a new block has been
confirmed. So then you request the transaction list from the latest block,
and check each confirmed transaction against your database of receive/watch
addresses. If there is a match, you record the transaction info in your
database so you can use it as an input later to create a spend transaction.
You could also use something like Bitpay's Insight to make interfacing with
bitcoind easier.
What are you trying to build?
I prefer to wait until all facts are in before I pass judgement. I think
BitGo is an excellent company with a great track record. If used properly,
they are extremely secure. If you are worried about storing funds there
long time, don't--just use them to detect incoming payments and move your
funds elsewhere for long term storage.

Wouldn't you lose the ability to assume transactions in the blockchain are
verified as valid, since miners can't see the details of what is being
spent and how? I feel like this ability is bitcoin's greatest asset, and by
removing it you're creating an altcoin different enough to not be connected

That is a good point. As you said, it puts a lot more burden on the coin
holders. One big downside would be data management. Instead of simply
backing up a single HD private key, the user would have to back up entire
histories of every output that has been sent to them if they want to secure
their funds.
It also requires them to be online to receive payments, and I think finding
a method of sending the private message containing the coin's history is
going to be a bit of a challenge. If you connect directly to the recipient
to convey the information through traditional channels, anonymity is lost.
Sending messages through the bitcoin network is one option to protect
anonymity, but without active pathfinding there's no guarantee the payee
will even get the message. I'm assuming you'd have to essentially replace
tx messages with encrypted BBC histories, and mempools are quite full as it

One more thought about why verification by miners may be needed.
Let's say Alice sends Bob a transaction, generating output C.
A troll, named Timothy, broadcasts a transaction with a random hash,
referencing C's output as its spend proof. The miners can't tell if it's
valid or not, and so they include the transaction in a block. Now Bob's
money is useless, because everyone can see the spend proof referenced and
thinks it has already been spent, even though the transaction that claims
it isn't valid.
Did I miss something that protects against this?

I agree, audio-based transference isn't really great for a podcast or radio

have cameras, though. I think it would be better to define a standard for
transmitting information over audio, but not define what information is to
be conveyed so people could use the method for sending pub keys, payment
protocol requests, or anything else developers might want to make use of.
I'm guessing some sort of data-over-audio standard already exists? In which

that the intruder wouldn't know this is a honeypot, or that they would know

@_author: James MacWhyte 
@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Capital Efficient Honeypots w/ "Scorched Earth" 
I was talking about the traditional concept. From Wikipedia: "Generally, a
honeypot consists of data (for example, in a network site) that appears to
be a legitimate part of the site but is actually isolated and monitored,
and that seems to contain information or a resource of value to attackers,
which are then blocked."
I would argue there are ways to make it look like it is not a honeypot
(plenty of bitcoin services have had their hot wallets hacked before, and
if the intruder only gains access to one server they wouldn't know that all
the servers have the same honeypot on them). But I was just confirming that
the proposal is for an obvious honeypot.
intruder has is designed to waste the honeypot AND additional funds
belonging to the honeypot creator. That's pretty good, from a game theory

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Managing block size the same way we do difficulty 
Hi All,
I'm coming late to the party. I like the Block75 proposal.
Multiple people have said miners would/could stuff blocks with insincere
transactions to increase the block size, but it was never adequately
explained what they would gain from this. If there aren't enough legitimate
transactions to fill up the block, where do you plan to earn extra income
once the block is bigger?
Miners would be incentivized to include as many legitimate transactions as
possible, but if propagation time is as big an issue as some of you have
said it is, miners would also be incentivized to keep their blocks small
enough to propagate. So why not give them the choice? Once the block size
gets too big to propagate effectively, miners would be naturally
incentivized to limit how much data they put in each block, finding the
perfect balance.
In my opinion, none of the downsides presented so far have been a good
argument. Risk of a 51% attack is not unique to this proposal, saying "we
could also do that with hardcoded limits" doesn't actually point out any
problem with this proposal, and miners already have the ability to add or
withhold transactions from their blocks.
We trust our miners to serve us by acting in their own best interests, and
this proposal simply gives them more options for doing that. If anyone can
make a strong argument against that would earn top marks in a high school
debate class, I'd love to hear it!

Thanks for starting this discussion, Erik.
This is not quite accurate. BIP75 is designed to be independent of any name
resolution system. You could use it with a static URL that you share, for
example, or even use it to implement a mesh-network payment system over
bluetooth. Netki's wallet names do use DNS, but that isn't related to this
What BIP75 *does* do is provide a way for a client to get a new payment
address for every payment. I personally think it is better than BIP47 for
the uses you mentioned (subscriptions, etc).
I'm glad you brought up identity methods other than x509. At breadwallet we
are thinking about how to establish the most universal system, and letting
users identify themselves with any of a selection of identity systems is
ideal. I think the pki_data slot should be constantly expanded to allow new
identity types, but they should be explained/standardized in the BIPs that
add them and use universal names. "netki://" wouldn't be appropriate, for
example, if their method is open sourced and possibly used by others--it
should instead be given a product name like "dnswallet://" or something
more clever.

KYC isn't the only use case. There are other situations in which you would
want to confirm who is sending you money. Making it *required* would of
course be a horrible idea, but allowing people to identify themselves, in
many cases with an online-only identity that isn't tied to their real world
identity, will be very useful to newly-developing use cases.

I like your idea about expanding Bitcoin URI's to include signatures. For
BIP75 store and forward servers we are already thinking the DNS record
would have the user's public key as well as the URL of their store and
forward endpoint, so as soon as that becomes a standard you could use it
just for the public key part. Expanding the Bitcoin URI should be done as
well, for people who want to go the simpler route and not rely on servers.
Erik, Andy, everyone else,
I don't understand why subscriptions would need to be built into the
protocol. With BIP75 the merchant could automatically issue a
PaymentRequest message every X amount of time, and the customer's wallet
would either display the request like normal or be set to pre-authorize
requests from the merchant. If the merchant goes out of business, the
requests would stop coming. This sounds like a UI issue and not a
protocol-level requirement.
If you think I'm wrong, please explain why :)

Our BIP just defines protocol definitions, and doesn't really dictate how
people use them (we're coming up with a new title for the BIP, by the way,
to more accurately convey that). Using our definitions as building blocks,
someone could definitely accomplish what you described. For example, Joe
Mobile Wallet User's wallet could upload a slew of generic PaymentRequest
messages with signatures to prove his identity, and the server could then
create encryptedPaymentRequest messages using the server's key for
encryption and communication with the other party. In this case the server
would essentially be a proxy for the user without having actual access to
the user's private keys.
My personal goal with the protocol was to keep it extremely flexible so
developers could use it to build all different types of schemes while
keeping standard messages that could be forwarded between services if
needed. Does the above make sense?

If you are okay with anyone being able to view your PaymentRequest
messages, then you wouldn't need to encrypt them. Just upload them to the
server and let it give them away--no trust needed as long as you include a
signature. If you want only certain people to be able to see your messages,
then you need to denote those people in some way. In this situation, you
would do that by trading public keys and uploading encryptedPaymentRequest
messages to the server that only those people could read.
Using the encrypted method doesn't require the devices to be online, but it
does require at least one of the parties to know the other party's public
key. Do you have a specific use case in mind?

Hi everyone,
Our BIP (officially proposed on March 1) has tentatively been assigned
number 75. Also, the title has been changed to "Out of Band Address
Exchange using Payment Protocol Encryption" to be more accurate.
We thought it would be good to take this opportunity to add some optional
fields to the BIP70 paymentDetails message. The new fields are:
subtractable fee (give permission to the sender to use some of the
requested amount towards the transaction fee), fee per kb (the minimum fee
required to be accepted as zeroconf), and replace by fee (whether or not a
transaction with the RBF flag will be accepted with zeroconf). I know it
doesn't make much sense for merchants to accept RBF with zeroconf, so that
last one might be used more to explicitly refuse RBF transactions (and
allow the automation of choosing a setting based on who you are transacting
I see BIP75 as a general modernization of BIP70, so I think it should be
fine to include these extensions in the new BIP, even though these fields
are not specific to the features we are proposing. Please take a look at
the relevant section and let me know if anyone has any concerns:

That's a valid point, and one we had thought of, which is why I wanted to
get everyone's opinion. I agree the proposed field extensions have nothing
to do with encryption, but does it make sense to propose a completely
separate BIP for such a small thing? If that is the accepted way to go, we
can split it into two and make a separate proposal.

I agree doing it out-of-band is the easiest solution for people who need
this privacy right now, but I do like the idea of adding this feature as
the number of SPV wallets is going to increase. I think the best way to
organize things would be to give encrypted messages their own port number,
similar to how http vs. https works.
We don't want two networks to develop, separated by which nodes support
encryption and which don't, so ideally nodes would rebroadcast messages
they receive on both (encrypted and non-encrypted) channels. This would
essentially double the required bandwidth of the network, which is
something to think about.

unencrypted connections, and are only interested in other peers that
support encryption. From their perspective, it is quite inefficient to get
a generic list of peers and then have to connect to each one searching for
those that accept encryption. If we use port numbers, we can assume any
connection that comes on the encrypted port is only interested in encrypted
communication, so a getaddr to an encrypted port would only return a list
of other encryption-capable peers.
This isn't an issue if the plan is to require all peers to support
encryption, and we assume the majority of the network will upgrade before
too long.
You're right, there would not be an increase in bandwidth. Please forget I
said that :) But following the logic I wrote above, it would be possible
for peers to become segregated (those who require encryption would only
connect to each other). It wouldn't be a problem as long as there are
enough peers that provide both encrypted and non-encrypted connections; or,
as I said above, if we can assume every peer will support it. Maybe the
issues I'm thinking of are just growing pains that will be solved once the
majority of people upgrade?

We've made some significant changes to BIP75 which we think simplify things
Instead of introducing encrypted versions of all BIP70 messages
(EncryptedPaymentRequest, EncryptedPayment, etc), we have defined a generic
EncryptedProtocolMessage type which is essentially a wrapper that enables
encryption for all existing BIP70 messages. This reduces the number of new
messages we are defining and makes it easier to add new message types in
the future.
We've also decided to use AES-GCM instead of AES-CBC, which eliminates the
need for the verification hash.

appropriately. Instead of using this list to debate what wallet designers
should or shouldn't do, we should just provide the tools and "let the

In practice it has quite a few qualities that make it a bit more resilient
for physical (written) storage.
If a few letters of a word get rubbed off or otherwise become illegible, it
is pretty easy for a native speaker to figure out what the word is supposed
to be. Even a non-native speaker could look through the word list and
figure out which word fits. Missing characters in a hex string require more
advanced brute force searching, which the average user isn't capable of.
Additionally, having the bits grouped into words makes a more serious
recovery easier. If you lose one entire word, it can be brute forced in
about 5 minutes on a normal pc, even if you don't know which position the
missing word is in (I have published a tool that does just this:
 If you are missing
two words, you can brute force it in about a week (napkin math).
If you were missing a random chunk of a hex string, I don't know how you'd
go about brute forcing that in a timely manner.
As an aside, from a UX standpoint we've seen that the 12 words don't *look*
important so people don't take them seriously (and they get lost). A hex
string or equivalent would look more password-y, and therefore would most
likely be better protected by users.

A URI is useful as a standard for one-way communication, but on-chain

transaction in one direction, but once the signer has signed the

you could include a callback URL, like BIP72 does, so the signer can pass
the signed transaction back to the organizer. However, BIP72 was created as
a backwards-compatible extension to BIP70, which was designed for one-way
communication. Since there is no way to be backwards compatible here, there
is no need to limit yourself to the URI system. Instead of creating a new
URI and using it for something it is not suited for, it would be better (in

I tend to have this conversation a lot ;) I'm not sure what Aymeric has in
mind, but my suggestions are for use by the small few who properly
understand how these things work. I am not suggesting blockchain.info
require every user to choose a book passage to use as their backup phrase!
There are so many small things that could be done to make a text input
unique. Choose the X number of words from the start of the Nth sentence.
Replace all punctuation with exclamation points. Combine two sentences from
different pages. It would be nigh impossible to brute force any of these,
and would require hints/instructions from the owner to recover.
But I admit if this is not intended for standardization, discussing it on
this mailing list is probably unwarranted.

Mid-level hardware can check 50k addresses per second, which means it would
only take around 2 hours to check all possibilities. So please don't think
this presents any kind of challenge to someone who finds your 20 pieces of
paper and assumes you would only keep them if they are hiding your wallet ;)
Entropy-wise, simply using a strong RNG would provide a better result than
relying on the printing company. Maybe they only print 35 different
combinations and assume people don't eat Chinese food enough to notice?
If it's poor entropy and doesn't really provide any protection against
being brute forced if found, I'm not sure why you would want to go
this route :)
