ok, imagine if firstbits didn't exist. instead of going to firstbits,
you would have gone to your terminal, opened up brmlabs website, and
copied the address from there?
there may be some arguments for name-> address translation, but i'm
sorry to say, that your example is not one of them. if anything, it
seems to suggest that firstbits is completely useless, since it saves
approximately zero effort.

well, it's easy to miss the point when the example you use doesn't
make the point you think you're making. :D
but ok, yes, it would be nice to send directly to something like
1brmlab from the client. i suppose figuring out how to make sure that
1brmlab actually does send to whom you think it sends, is left to the
details of implementation, but that's a separate question.

+1 on git. not necessarily as replacement, but at least as backup.
could possibly use markdown and github pages, which automagically
pushes git commits out to the website (uses markdown syntax, iirc)

this is an excellent "painting the bikeshed" question, so i cannot
resist participation :)
imo, anyone who has any business looking at the beps (which would
generally be technically-minded people), will be smart enough to
google for "bitcoin bep003" to find what he's looking for. so i don't
see an issue, whatever acronym we end up using.

i'm sure that with the list being unused, we could change the charter

Indeed, good points on all counts.
good points. re 1), i'm pretty sure that -dev is the most active
bitcoin-related public mailing list. things may have changed in the past
half-year, but it seems unlikely.
charter can be changed if needed. creator/maintainer, that being me, is
generally known to be a pretty decent guy :). i'm not attached to this
particular list though, but whatever happens, i'd hope that there will
be more people willing to share administrative duties. not sure if
googlegroups is the best interface, if we can find some good free host
with mailman, downloadable archives, the works, that may be preferable.
i started that group on gg simply because it was free and easily
available and easy to set up.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Random order for clients page 
This discussion is quite bikesheddy, but (or thus? :) ) I will put in my
The main thing to think about, I think, is "what would be best for the
users". To that end, I suggest the following:
* I do think a page on bitcoin.org listing relatively major, and
relatively vetted, clients is a good idea. Removing it completely and
relegating it to a wiki page, which is likely to contain all sorts of
marginal crufty clients, would likely be a disservice to the users.
* Randomized order is likely also a disservice to the users. We should
list clients in order of "goodness", as determined by whoever(s) we
decide to put in charge of the page. This "goodness" should likely to be
some kind of weighted average of features, security, goodness for
bitcoin network, etc. [1]
** If randomized order is after all chosen, it should be done in
javascript client-side, rather than doing daily page reorgs. If people
without JS don't see random, it's not material at all.
* Prose vs. feature matrix: both have their good and bad points, as
discussed upthread. I think the users will be best served by a
combination of both:
** Prose descriptions of clients should deliberately include negative
points, not just let the user infer them by lack of corresponding
positive mention. (e.g. "This client has fast startup time. That means
you're completely trusting the server operator with your money.") This
task is left up to the person(s) in charge.
** A feature matrix, with carefully chosen and /well defined/
categories, /in addition to prose/ would likely also be of service to
the users. That could be left to the wiki though. The current wiki
clients page seems to be having a good go at it.[2]
** If we are targeting people who "don't know what they're doing", it
may be a good idea to have a 'decision assistant' type setup, where
users are asked several questions and are recommended clients based on
these answers. (This could be done in a static way by having a matrix of
Finally - I'd say we're spending disproportionate developer resources on
this question, and if it were completely up to me, I'd resolve this
situation in the following quick-and-painless way: leave page as is, add
negative points to prose, link to wiki clients list. Estimated time to
completion: 1 hour (to think through which negative points to add).

That way there's an easy link from the main site, but the content is
readily editable and expandable.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Safe auto-updating 
If you want package authentication, you should at least throw in some
digital signing, not just a checksum. With a compromised host, both the
checksum and binaries can be changed undetectably, but if there's a
signature made by a key that is not kept on the host, there's no way to
fake a valid binary.
There may be other issues people would want to bring up, but surely just
a checksum is not sufficient.

an updater for security reasons... Has been thought out in more detail
since that decision was made?
a Tor hidden service, whose only function is to output a checksum of the
update package. The theory is that if it is well-secured, it will at
least be immune to tampering at the physical hosting level.

the point was just that "if need be" free capacity is available without
having to throw money at it. until there's no need, doesn't matter.
also hackability (and ui) should be irrelevant for the autoupdate
process (which i presume will do all kinds of checksum and sig
verification). and it's likely the autoupdates that will create very
lumpy download demand.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] moving the default display to mbtc 
this seems like such a paint-the-bikeshed problem that it's sure to
generate vast volumes of discussion, waste a lot of people's time, and
all for only a dubious (imo) gain. (case in point - here i am
contributing to it :) ).
i agree that we should avoid centralizing this. i'll go a step further
and note that the client already has a dropdown allowing individuals to
choose units. merchants are free to choose to price in different units.
exchanges are free to denominate trade in different units.
i suggest we just let the market do its thing and not get into trying to
'make a decision' of any sort.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Running a full node 
Hi Francis,
Here are some rough guidelines for you, based on the statistics from my
disk usage: about 30GB currently for the blockchain data. It'll only
keep growing from here, but relatively slowly.
cpu usage: pretty much nothing, after you have synced the blockchain.
ram usage: after it runs for a few months, my node gets up to using 1.5
GB of ram or so.
bandwidth usage: my node averages about 500GB of traffic per month, most
of it outgoing.
Hope that gives you a rough idea of what you can expect for running full
