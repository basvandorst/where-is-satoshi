Hello Devs,
I am Patrick Sharp. I just graduated with a BS is computer science. Forgive
my ignorance.
As per bip-0002 I have scoured each bip available on the wiki to see if
these ideas have already been formally proposed and now as per bip-0002
post these ideas here.
First and foremost I acknowledge that these ideas are not original nor new.
Side Chains:
Bip-R10 offers a mechanism to assign custody or transfer coins from one
chain to another. However I did not find a bip that proposed a formal
bitcoin side chain.
My proposal
   - They are officially supported, tracked and built by official bitcoin
   software meaning that they are not an external chain
   - each chain has an identifier in the block header i.e. main chain: 0,
   first chain: 1, second chain: 2...
   - the number of chains including the main chain that exists is always a
   power of 2, this power will also be included in the block header.
   - each address is assigned to a chain via chain = (address) mod (number
   of chains)
      - to be valid an addresse's next transaction will first send their
      coins to their chain if they are not already there
      - if the address they are sending to is outside their chain their
      transaction will be submitted to both chains and transaction fee will be
      split between chains
   - They come into being via a fork or split
      - every 2016 blocks (upon recalculation of difficulty) if some
      percentage (lets say 10%) of blocks on any chain are larger than some
      specified amount (lets say 750 KB) then all chains are called to
      their power value and fork on their block.
         - miner of chain x creates genesis block for chain x+2^previous
         power
         - upon fork, the difficulty of the old chain and the new chain
         will be half the next difficulty
      - if every chain has gone 2016 block without surpassing some amount
      (lets say 250 KB) at least some percentage of the time (lets say 10%) all
      chains will be called to join, decrement their power and double their
      difficulty
         - given miner of chain x, if x not less than 2^new power, chain
         will be marked dead or sleeping
         - miners who mine blocks on the chain that was joined (the chain
         with the smaller identifier) may have to make a block for the sleeping
         chain if transactions include funds that fully or partially
originate from
         the sleeping chain
         - dead chain are revived on next split.
      - each block's reward outside of transaction fees will be the
      (current bounty / 2^fork power) except obviously for dead blocks who's
      reward is already included in their joined block
   - benefits
      - dynamically scales to any level of usage, no more issues about
      block size
      - miners have incentive to keep all difficulties close to parity
      - if miners are limited by hard drive space they don't have to mine
      every chain (though they should have trusted peers working on
other chains
      to verify transactions that originate off their chains, faulty block will
      still be unaccepted by the rest of the miners)
      - though work will still grow linearly with the number of chains due
      to having to hash each separate header, some of the overhead may remain
      constant and difficulty and reward will still be balanced.
      - transactions are pseudo equally distributed between chains.
      - rewards will be more distributed (doesn't' really matter, except
      that its beautiful)
   - cons
      - because most transactions will be double recorded the non-volatile
      memory foot print of bitcoin doubles (since miners do not need
all chains i
      believe this solution not only overcomes this cost but may decrease the
      foot print per miner in the long run overall)
      - transactions will hang in limbo until both chains have picked them
      up, a forever limboed transaction could result in lost coins, as
long as a
      transaction fee has been included this risk should be mitigated.
I believe this idea is applicable to the entire community. I would like
your thoughts and suggestions. I obviously think this is a freaking awesome
idea. I know it is quite ambitious but it is the next step in evolution
that bitcoin needs to take to be a viable competitor to visa.
I come to you to ask if this has any chance of acceptance.

Hello Devs,
I am Patrick Sharp. I just graduated with a BS is computer science. Forgive
my ignorance.
As per bip-0002 I have scoured each bip available on the wiki to see if
these ideas have already been formally proposed and now as per bip-0002
post these ideas here.
First and foremost I acknowledge that these ideas are not original nor new.
Trimming and demurrage:
I am fully aware that demurrage is a prohibited change. I hereby contest.
For the record I am not a miner, I am just aware of the economics that
drive the costs of bitcoin.
Without the ability to maintain some sort of limit on the maximum length or
size of the block chain, block chain is not only unsustainable in the long
run but becomes more and more centralized as the block chain becomes more
and more unwieldy.
Trimming is not a foreign concept. Old block whose transactions are now
spent hold no real value. Meaningful trimming is expensive and inhibited by
unspent transactions. Old unspent transactions add unnecessary and unfair
   - Old transactions take up real world space that continues incur cost
   while these transactions they do not continue to contribute to any sort of
   payment for this cost.
   - One can assume that anybody with access to their bitcoins has the
   power to move these bitcoins from one address to another (or at least that
   the software that holds the keys to their coins can do it for them) and it
   is not unfair to require them to do so at least once every 5 to 10 years.
   - Given the incentive to move it or lose it and software that will do it
      for them, we can assume that any bitcoin not moved is most likey
      lost.
      - moving these coins will cost a small transaction fee which is fair
      as their transactions take up space, they need to contribute
      - most people who use their coins regularly will not even need to
      worry about this as their coins are moved to a change address anyway.
   - one downside is that paper wallets would then have an expiration date,
   however I do not think that a paper wallet that needs to be recycled every
   5 to 10 years is a terrible idea.
Therefore I propose that the block chain length be limited to either 2^18
blocks (slightly less than 5 years) or 2^19 blocks, or slightly less than
10 years. I propose that each time a block is mined the the oldest block(s)
(no more than two blocks) beyond this limit is trimmed from the chain and
that its unspent transactions are allowed to be included in the reward of
the mined block.
This keeps the block chain from tending towards infinity. This keeps the
costs of the miners balanced with the costs of the users.
Even though I believe this idea will have some friction, it is applicable
to the entire community. It will be hard for some users to give up small
benefits that they get at the great cost of miners, however miners run the
game and this fair proposal is in in their best interest in two different
ways. I would like your thoughts and suggestions. I obviously think this is
a freaking awesome idea. I know it is quite controversial but it is the
next step in evolution that bitcoin needs to take to ensure immortality.
I come to you to ask if this has any chance of acceptance.

I shamefully was not aware. However familiarized myself with them.
Non official chains suffer from the fact that few if any miners are going
to mine them so they lack security on par with the main chain. And more
over most users aren't going to use them because its not magic.
That being said think they are and will always be a great place to develop
and prove out concepts.
If my ultimate goal is official side chains that include part of the reward
such security is at parity between all chains and that the official
software automatically enable users to distribute their burden, would my
course of action be to build an external proof-of-concept side chain of
side chains?
or do you doubt that official reward splitting chains will ever find their
way into bitcoin core?

By magic I meant that that it happens all by itself without any extra
Thank you for your responses. I have been enlightened. As ZmnSCPxj has
pointed out lightning network and pruning accomplishes everything I set out
to accomplish. And sharding is exactly what I had in mind. I will keep this
in the back of my mind and perhaps even attempt will implement it if it
still seems worth doing later.
You guys are totally awesome!!!
I here by withdraw my proposal for the time being.

Thank you for your responses. I have been enlightened. For the time being
the combination of the UTXO's and pruning will accomplish what I desire. I
suspect that there will come a time when the UTXO database becomes too
large, but I guess that is a problem for another day. If that day ever
comes 10 years was just an example, like you said there are reasons to
preserve value beyond that point, perhaps a human lifetime or two would be
a better choice.
Side question: wouldn't it be a good idea to store the hash of the current
or previous UTXO's in the block header so that pruned nodes can verify
their UTXO's are accurate without having to check the full chain? and/or
maybe include a snap shot of the UTXO's every x blocks?
You guys are totally awesome!!!
