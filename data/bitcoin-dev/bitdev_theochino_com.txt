I might have a "crazy" simple solution.
authenticate him using Bitcoin.
HBO John Oliver's program might have given me (and hopefully others) the
brilliant idea to protect the Bitcoin network from the overzealous reach of
the politicians. One need to start a Church, and to start the Church one
need funds (121UZ1hDs9MgCHonA8vjXr89D8FuDf5c7t) to start.
John Oliver's program on HBO about Churches (and the hypocrisy of some) was
epic and such entity could argue that Bitcoin is a belief system (which it
is) and would force the issue at a Federal level under the Church and State
separation. - John's video : At this time, I am waiting for the License issue to walk its course in New
York State.
   - I am waiting for my License to be denied (to protest) and appeal it.
   - Waiting to hear from the License process to appeal the law in general.
   - Meeting Elected officials (in New York City, NY State, and France) and
   educating them on Bitcoin.
Every time we (the community) talk about Bitcoin, it can sound like
religion; therefore why not go all the way and do what John Oliver did ?
Seed money would help. :)
Regarding the Fork, from my perspective of a small company, I see that like
it was with IRC with the ICMP node split. The Church thing is not here to
take side but to "try" to protect the Bitcoin.
We will need to ordain ministers selected after completing prescribed
courses of study setup by the developers.
In short I am asking Satochi to help this church with original coins. If it
is a troll, I am talking to the Dev Community at large to recruit them to
ordain the ministers.

Foundation; still don't have enough information and thing will move faster
than I can devote the time to read about it.)*

Talking politics, Devs do day and night, however politics is also about
knocking on door and not sitting behind a keyboard writing a perl script to
spam the politicians with the same content. Politics is about maneuvering
to be in a position to get the elected official to do what you want because
if he don't, you will make sure it will not get elected next time.
I personally never could finish drilling into the code (which is very
elegantly written) because some New York idiot decided that Bitcoin was too
dangerous for society to handle. I had to stop playing with the code and
turn my attention elsewhere. *You can read the opinion of one of the idiot

Another use for the audio would be for watches that can listen but can't
use a camera (ie: Samsung S2), so sound would be great.

Ken and team,
Took some time but here it is ! *Bravo !*
And as usual reporter make up the shit they want ... Feel free to remind
them that we had a working group and we worked on it.
The "Could be" is a bit too much. It's time we keep reporter in check so
feel free to remind her in your own way.
My way is "pissed off tweet", 877277497796198400 but used your own way.
A page is officially turned.
