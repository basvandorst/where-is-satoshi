Setting aside all security benefits (which the user can obviously choose to
implement or ignore), a major benefit here is being able to have multiple
wallets use the same blockchain process. I have 3 different bitcoind
processes running on the same server to utilize multiple wallets. Using
them serially isn't an option in my case. Also, peers can run the cheaper
process instead of having the wallet functionality which isn't even used.
On the security front, this doesn't seem to be any less secure and it gives
the user the flexibility to make it as secure as they feel comfortable. If
they want to run them both as the same user with no SELinux or file
protections (this isn't stopping or encouraging that) they're already doing
that now with bitcoind, albeit with possibly a larger attack surface.

Heads up... downloaded the linux tar.gz to my OVH box and got my server
terminated. Screenshot from the email:
They claimed I was attacking 88.198.199.140 over port 443.

Didn't mean that bitcoind was connecting over port 443. I didn't even get a
chance to compile. I was literally just finished downloading the tar.gz
file when my server was terminated.
Still trying to convince them I wasn't attacking anyone so they can
re-enable the server.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] New side channel attack that can recover 
This adds a very minor amount of security, if any, if someone manages to
hack into your "hot wallet" server they can just initiate a non-multisig
transaction and still steal all your bitcoins in that wallet. You can't
give the argument that the RPC API is password protected because the
password is stored in plain-text in the config so all someone has to do is
first grep for the file. There doesn't appear to be a way to force ALL
outgoing transactions to be multisig and even if there was one, would you
be able to force one of the addresses to be the "hardened" server? That
still wouldn't prevent anyone from just stopping bitcoind, changing the
config, then restarting it.
Unless you're using your own custom wallet software there doesn't seem to
be any sufficient way to prevent someone from stealing all your money once
they have access to your server. Other software, like MySQL has access
controls so I can prevent ALTERs, DROPs, DELETEs, etc for all "live"
accounts limiting the scope of any attack if they manage to get into the
server. Maybe this is beyond the scope of bitcoind, not sure.
