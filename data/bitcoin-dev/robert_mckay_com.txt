If bitcoin listened on IPv6 that might help for alot of people. Windows 7
users get a teredo IPv6 address (unless they disable it) when behind NAT on
IPv4. Take any win7 box and put it on a typical NAT /DSL setup this is what
happens. I think this might actually work for more users than have UPNP
support on their DSL gateways. teredo IPs aren't that stable though (they
change frequently) and they might tend to flood the address cache with stale

If miners wanted to continue mining empty blocks without bothering to monitor the Tx pool they would just switch to stuffing the empty blocks with a dummy transaction of their own to get round your new rules. They could also spam them to the p2p network so that they end up in the mempool if that were necessary. This would probably still be slightly easier than 'doing it properly'.
Once the block reward halves in a few months time then receiving transaction fees will probably become more important to the miner's profit and loss calculations and they'll spend the extra time to implement proper transaction processing. I suspect if we do nothing this particular issue will go away. Perhaps it could be helped along by publishing some example code to make it easier for them.
The ability to refuse transactions seems like an important part of the game theory of transaction pricing. Miners are supposed to be able to jack up transaction costs by declining to process no fee or too low fee (in their opinion) transactions.. the counter balance is that they are losing money by doing that and leaving more on the table for the next miner to score a block.
I expect that in the future there will be other instances when people complain that the miners are being 'unfair' and that the rules should be changed in some way to lower transaction fees (ie: increase block size).
If block sizes are increased ever larger and miners aren't allowed to refuse to process transactions it will get rid of the financial motivation for mining and less mining will happen. We should be very careful when making these kinds of changes.
Setting percentage quotas of stuff in the mempool sounds dangerous.. miners that hear about a block from a rival miner soon enough could possibly DOS the mempool on the rest of the network to get the block rejected. I think it should be legitimate not to publish a transaction to the p2p network at all.. in the future there will probably be lots of networks other than the p2p network.. right now we have the IPv6 network and the IPv4 network.. in the future there could be many other protocols and perhaps not all transactions will make it back to the old legacy ipv4 p2p network or into the mempool of bitcoin nodes on that network.. but they should still be able to get into the block chain.

Unless all the miners are monitoring the work they do for their pools and the actual miners that found the blocks noticed (unlikely) - the only way anyone knows which pool did anything is the source IP that first disseminates the new block. Also since it's unlikely that both of the doublespend blocks would be found by the same end miner, neither of them would know that the pool operator was responsible even if they were monitoring their work.
There's nothing stopping the pool owner from channeling the doublespend blocks through some other previously unknown IP, so I don't think they would suffer any reputational damage from doing this repeatidly.

It's just as easy to steal emails via a BGP or DNS redirect anyway.. you could even take over the actual domain at the registry level by stealing a password reset via BGP or DNS redirect and actually many registries will hand over control of a domain by faxing them a forged driving license in the owner's name anyway so it doesn't even really need to be a particularly sophisticated attacker. Once you have registry control of the domain it's easy enough to get an SSL cert too, probably even an 'extended validation' one.
When Afghanistan was taken over the entire .af TLD was probably transferred using a forged fax to ICANN ( but I guess that's a little different :p

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Tor / SPV 
I think it might be ok to use proof-of-stake on as an anti-sybil scheme on tor.. people would obviously not want to associate their wallet with their IP address, but is there any harm in associating it with a (temporary) tor service id (especially one that isn't used for anything other than relaying bitcoin transactions)? If each node you connect too can sign some challenge with a key that controls some BTC (and your client node verifies that the funds are different) then that might be useful.. even if it were only a small 0.01BTC stake that would be similar to the cost of obtaining another IP through a cheap VPS or VPN and significantly higher than the cost to an attacker who is able to MITM everything and operate on any IP anyway.

Here's a packet dump of a connected client:
Doesn't seem particularly abusive.. only one connection, not doing much traffic. I don't have any easy way to deserialize this and see if it's doing anything unusual but it's there if someone wants to have a go.

I don't think Sybil attack is the right term for this.. there is only one IP address.. one "identity".
I'm not even sure that this behaviour can be considered abuse.. it's pretty much following the rules and maybe even improving the transaction and block propagation.
As far as monitoring transaction origins someone could do that using lots of different IPs instead of just one (more like an actual Sybil attack rather than this non-Sybil attack).. and noone would be making a fuss (and imo, probably someone does do that too as it would be useful to capture a larger number of inbound connections).

It should be possible to configure bind as a DNS forwarder.. this can be done in a zone context.. then you can forward the different zones to different dnsseed daemons running on different non-public IPs or two different ports on the same IP (or on one single non-public IP since there's really no reason to expose the dnsseed directly daemon at all).

Setting it up as a zone forwarder causes each request to go through to the dnsseed backend for each request.

This stackoverflow describes a similar situation;
you can additionally specify the port to forward too;
it should be possible to forward to different ports on 127.0.0.1 for each dnsseed instance.

Hi Alex,
I think the problem is with my suggestion to use bind forwarding.. basically bind is stripping off the authorative answer bit in the reply.. this causes the recursor to go into a loop chasing the authority server which again returns a non-authoritve answer with itself as the authority again. I'm not sure if this can be fixed without hacking the bind src, so maybe it wasn't such a great suggestion in the first place. Basically I think if bind was returning authorative answers it would work, but I can't see any way to make that happen in the bind

No, I don't think so. The problem is the 'aa' flag is missing (see the 'flags' section in dig). Perhaps if you could suppress the authority records the recursor would give up and just accept the non-authorative answer, but that isn't a good solution even if it might work for some

A simple hack would be to crontab up a couple of dig scripts that every minute 'dig' (dig's output is in bind zonefile format) the bitcoin-seed and write the results to two zonefiles that bind can then serve.
dig  -p 5353 > zonefile1.zone
dig  -p 5354 > zonefile2.zone
pkill -HUP named
Ugly, but should work.

Basically the problem with that is that someone could setup a single full node that has the blockchain and can answer those challenges and then a bunch of other non-full nodes that just proxy any such challenges to the single full node.

The main motivation is to try and stop a single entity running lots of nodes in order to harvest transaction origin IPs. That's what's behind Probably the efforts are a waste of time.. if someone has to keep a few hundred copies of the blockchain around in order to keep IP specific precomputed data around for all the IPs they listen on then they'll just buy a handful of 5TB HDs and call it a day.. still some of the ideas proposed are quite interesting and might not have much downside.
