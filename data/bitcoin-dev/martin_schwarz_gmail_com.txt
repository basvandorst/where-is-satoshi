I think we should set the right incentives to invalidate these assumptions. If the fees as well as the security guarantees
on the main chain are highest and fees are dropping with the distance from the main chain on each level of side chains,
wouldn't communities with many internal transactions create their own side chain with low fees? I'd expect geographic
as well as virtual communities to be forming enjoying cheap fees on their 'local' chains and expensive but comparabily rare
'long distance' fees. One would expect geographic chains (e.g. continents) as well as virtual ones (e.g. the Open Bazaar
users' chain) to form. To save fees, a typical user would maintain a wallet in each of her communities which are loaded
and drained with rare expensive transacations, whereas daily business with many transactions is done cheaply within
each community chain. So, indeed, I would argue that side chains equipped with the right cost incentives for cross-chain
transactions would lead to a scalable and efficiently self-organizing network of side chains.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Draft BIP : fixed-schedule block size increase 
in 2022 your proposal (BIP as well as code) crosses the 32MB maximum
message size limit. In order to avoid deployment of code that deterministically
fails fatally in 2022, I'd propose to stop the doublings at 32MB for now and fix
the message size limit in the mean time. Since the message size fix requires
a 2nd hard fork anyway, your current 8GB limit could be re-instateted in that
2nd fork as well. Even if you disagree, I'd suggest to address the topic in the BIP.

Isn't there some way to "rebase" a relative lock-time to some anchor even
further in the past while cancelling out the intermediate transactions?
