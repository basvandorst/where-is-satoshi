@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] testing bitcoin nodes 
I'm working as (software) test specialist and run private a full bitcoin node (based upon Raspberry Pi 4).
I've been trying to figure out the tests performed during installation/upgrade/compilation of the software for the node.
Is there any overview on what's the (common) test approach, or other stuff. Because the tests on GitHub don't help me that much.
I'd like to figure out what/how is tested, maybe refine test cases, and try some manual test also, as part of learning.
Who would be able to join me or share information that guides me.
Thanks in advance,

As no one was able to respond, a gentle reminder : ?
