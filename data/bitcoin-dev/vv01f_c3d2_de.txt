You can provide a reusable payment code (BIP-47) instead of an actual address. Unfortunately that not yet supported by the clients/apps most people use. Just that would be less a hurdle than providing a service that e.g. generates addresses from xpub.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] URI scheme with optional bech32 address 
When I use the example of HTML forms ?
test for URI schema
The resulting URI is:
That means that a URI attribute is not necessarily singular and can
indeed occur multiple times.
So as we do not have athority in our URI?
for URI = scheme:path[?query][
where query=[key1=value1[&key2=value2]]
?under the circumstance that path has a newer standard we can implement
fallback with: query=[path=newerversion[&path=evennewerversion]]
?as our path is the address, resulting in e.g.:
the effect should be
1. old clients ignore address attribute
2. supporting clients select the address attribute over the address
given in path *if* they support the format
3. future address formats do not need a new attribute
open to me would be:
* the order of the attributes and how this should be recognized/priorized
* is there any precedence for that multiple use of an attribute in URI
I think order of attributes should remain irrelevant, thus supporting
clients should check all attributes of the same name and attributes
should be defined for repetitive (like address) or not (amount) in the
BIP. This will still not support sending different amounts to multiple
addresses and be consistent with the older version of the URI scheme.

I already pointed out a while ago that the separator could be the & and
the returning value is either an address or an array of addresses.
So no comma or other delimiter needed.
also I would suggest to call the parameter `address` and not a shortcut
for it as we are used to `message` and `amount` spelled out as well.
