It doesn't do much good to only focus on the immediate symptoms at the
exclusion of big picture trends. There are three things happening now
that have nothing to do with operating systems.
1. The resource requirements of a full node are moving beyond the
capabilities of casual users. This isn't inherently a problem - after
all most people don't grow their own food, tailor their own clothes, or
keep blacksmith tools handy in to forge their own horseshoes either.
2. The growth of small and medium-sized native Bitcoin businesses is
lagging  Native here means their revenue and expenses are both
denominated in BTC. Most business adoption we've seen so far doesn't
actually handle bitcoins themselves. They use Bitcoin as a payment
method whose processing they outsource.
Contributing to this is the fact that Bitcoin Core, although it has made
great progress in the 0.9 release, can't be accurately described as
"enterprise ready".
3. The P2P protocol used by the network is broken from an incentive
perspective. Resource usage wouldn't be a problem as long as the users
which consume resources pay for them and the users who provide resources
are compensated, and they communicate via an efficient price discovery
mechanism. Right now there is no obvious way to incorporate price
discovery for bandwidth usage or storage space without a completely new
P2P protocol, and the effectiveness with which progress has been blocked
towards price discovery of transaction fees (the area where it is most
obviously necessary) means that I'm not optimistic that this subject
will ever be effectively addressed by Bitcoin Core.

In order to prevent future confusion: whenever I talk about

reality as it currently exists.
If I ever decide to talk about hypothetical future requirements in

imposed by the software that's actually available for casual users to

The bottleneck is not bulk disk space, but rather IOPS.
Most users don't have spare machines to dedicate to the task of
running a full node, nor is it acceptable for them to not be able to
use their device for other tasks while the node is bootstrapping.

If anyone cared about user privacy, then whatever was supplied to

If enough miners don't like a block that has been mined, they can all
work to orphan it without any change to the protocol whatsoever.
Why are proposing this a change to the network that allows miners to
vote to disregard output scripts, instead of creating an out of band
network via which miners can coordinate actions using the capabilities
the protocol already allows?
Once you've changed the network such that it is no longer a machine
that faithfully processes scripts, and instead is a machine via which
a set of controllers can decide which valid scripts will be honored
and which ones will not, what will be the next proposed condition
under which the miners can confiscate and redistribute balances?

I think everybody understands that Bitcoin has a positive net present
value exactly because it, unlike every other digital currency which
came before, does not include a feature that allows for balances to be
confiscated. Implementing any such feature, to any degree at all,
would render Bitcoin completely valueless.
There are two possibilities here:
If you understand this, then your proposal is a malicious attempt to
undermine Bitcoin.
If you don't understand this then you suffer from a very serious case
of economic illiteracy, a case so bad that your continued
participation in Bitcoin represents a clear and present danger to all
Bitcoin users. If you can't even get the easy questions right, then
god help us all if you're ever faced with a difficult one.
I don't have enough evidence to distinguish between the incompetence
hypothesis and the malice hypothesis, but it doesn't matter.
Regardless of your abilities or motives your proposal is unacceptable.
If you want a currency where miners can vote to steal from other
miners then implement it in Hearncoin and leave Bitcoin alone.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Framework for modular input selection policy 
One of the areas that isn't as well developed as it could be in terms of
wallet design is fine-grained control over input selection policy.
Coin control is great when a human is manually crafting transactions,
but that's not really a very scalable solution.
The attached image is a possible way to stack different independent
selection algorithms. If wallets implemented something like this, it
would be easy for other programs to implement new application-specific
algorithms that would not need to completely reinvent the wheel.
As an example, voting pools in Open-Transactions will implement cold
storage in a FIFO manner, meaning that UTXOs will be clustered into
groups which should be consumed in a specific sequence. Within that
constraint, however, they still want to minimize transaction size.
If wallets were designed to make selection policy modular, they'd only
need to implement their FIFO algorithm and stack it in before the
default algorithm. Surely this capability would be useful to other
projects as well.
It would also allow people who want to prioritize privacy over
transaction cost to easily modify the behavior of their clients and
would make it easier to incorporate new tx construction algorithms like

Hash: SHA1
If you allow the solution set to include pay-to-play networks, and not
just free P2P networks, then it's easier to find a solution
Imagine every node is competing with its peers in terms of relevancy.
Relevancy is established by delivering newly-seen transactions first.
Each node keeps track of which of its peers send it transactions that
it hadn't seen and forwarded to them yet (making sure that the
transactions do make it into a block) and uses that information to
determine whether or not it should be paying that peer, or if that
peer should be paying it, or if they are equal relevancy and no net
payment is required.
Once any given pair of nodes can establish who, if anyone, should be
paying they could use micropayment channels to handle payments.
Nodes that are well connected, and with high uptimes would end up
being net recipients of payments. Mobile nodes and other low-uptime
nodes would be net payers.
Now that you've established a market for the service of delivering
transaction information, you can rely on price signals to properly
match supply and demand.
People who hate market-based solutions could always run these nodes
and configure them to refuse to pay anyone, and to charge nothing to
their peers, if that's what they wanted.

Also consider that currently there are many people have already
demonstrated a willingness to donate bandwidth and resources to the
public by running nodes, so those people aren't going to disappear.
They could operate mixed-mode nodes, with a fraction of the allowed
incoming connections reserved for free peer, with free connections
might be limited in terms of time duration. Bitcoin-accepting
brick-and-mortars would probably allow free access to anyone connected
to their internal wifi to facilitate people wanting to pay.
Crowdfunded free bridges, assurance contracts, etc are all other ways
to let people get into the network with no upfront cost.
