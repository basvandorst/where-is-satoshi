How would this affect the user in terms of disk storage? They're going to
get hammered on space constraints aren't they? If it's not required how
likely are users to enable this?

This is probably just noise, but what if nodes could compress and store
earlier transaction sets (archive sets) and serve them up conditionally. So
if there were let's say 100 archive sets of (10,000 blocks) you might have
5 open at any time when you're an active archive node while the others sit
on your disk compressed and unavailable to the network. This would allow
nodes to have all full transactions but conserve disk space and network
activity since they wouldn't ever respond about every possible transaction.
This could be based on a rotational request period, based on request count
or done periodically. Once their considered active they would be expected
to uncompress a set and make it available to the network. Clients would
have to piece together archive sets from different nodes, but if there
weren't enough archive nodes to cover the chain they could ratchet up the
amount of required open archive sets when your node was active.
I fully expect to have my idea trashed, but I'm dipping toes in the waters
of contribution.

Looks like only about ~30% disk space savings so I see your point. Is there
a critical reason why blocks couldn't be formed into "superblocks" that are
chained together and nodes could serve a specific superblock, which could
be pieced together from different nodes to get the full blockchain? This
would allow participants with limited resources to serve full portions of
the blockchain rather than limited pieces of the entire blockchain.

Ok I think I've got a good understanding of where we're at now. I can
promise that the next person to waste your time in 30 days will not be me.
I'm pleasantly surprised to see a community that doesn't kickban newcomers
and takes the time to explain (re-explain) concepts.
Hoping to add *beneficial* thoughts in the future!

"So my question to the community is, how invasive is this to bitcoin's
source code?"
I'd say not very considering you have regression testing mode.

I would agree that the in person aspect of the WoT is frustrating, but to dismiss this as "geek wanking" is the pot calling the kettle. The value of in person vetting of identity is undeniable. Just because your risk acceptance is difference doesn't make it wanking. Please go see if you can get any kind of governmental clearance of credential without in-person vetting. Ask them if they accept your behavioral signature. I know there is a lot of PGP hating these days but this comment doesn't necessarily apply to every situation.

In the context of Bitcoin I will concede that perhaps it holds true for now.
I also never said the actual credential you receive from a government
agency is trustable. I completely agree that they are forgeable and not
necessarily reliable. That was not my point. I was referring to the vetting
process before issuance.
Just as you have behavioral characteristics online that contribute to
trusting an "identity" you also exhibit in person attributes, such as
physically being in a specific location at a certain time or blue eyes or
biometrics, that are valuable. You simply cannot capture those in an
online-only world. I don't see how you can deny the value there.
You are most certainly and undeniably the expert in the Bitcoin context
here so I will not even attempt to argue with you on that, but I just think
it's not realistic to ignore the value of an in-person network in other
contexts. You called it "geek wanking" with no qualifier "in the Bitcoin
context" so excuse me if I misunderstood your intent.

This sounds horrible. You could basically monitor anyone with a wallet in a highly populated area and track them super easily by doing facial recognition. Yes you could photograph people but it's way more burdensome. Sorry to go off topic a little.
