@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Progress on Miner Withholding - FPNC 
Hello all,
By the way, is this FPNC is similar to the way the current (or recent) code of Ethereum that is selecting branches based on the difficulty of the crypto puzzles solved to obtain the blocks of this branch without comparing the sizes of the subtrees?
Any ideas?
