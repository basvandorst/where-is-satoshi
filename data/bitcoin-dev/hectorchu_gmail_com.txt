@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Block size hard fork 
I haven't seen much discussion on this list of what will happen when the
blockchain forks due to larger blocks. I think the debate surrounding this
issue is a storm in a teacup, because transactions on the smaller chain can
and will appear on the bigger chain also. There is nothing tying
transactions to the blocks they appear in.
Miners will migrate to the bigger chain in search of higher profits due to
higher volume of fees. They can also collect the higher fees of the smaller
chain by including into the bigger chain as many as possible of the
transactions from the smaller chain.
To stop this from happening the smaller chain would somehow need to change
the serialized format of their transactions so the signatures would no
longer be valid across chains.
Incidentally I read somewhere that the losing chain would have their coins
sold down. Trying to sell the smaller chain's coins in the short term at
least is not advisable, as those transactions will appear on the bigger
chain too.

Right. Why anyone would want to do this intentionally, however, is not
clear. The coins would be worth less as they wouldn't be fungible across
the chains anymore.
Additionally, new coins will be issued, along with fees, on both
This is something that hadn't entered my mind when I made my assertions. At
the moment I can't see any way to avoid this fact.
Also any transaction whos casual history extends from one of the above
Wallets could detect this and notify the user. Due to Gresham's Law, I'll
admit the observation that these outputs would likely get spent in
preference (as they are less fungible), but whether the payee would be
happy to accept them is a different matter.
Well in your example they wouldn't, because they know that your version
wouldn't be accepted by the economic majority. But it's not as clear cut
for the larger blocks case. They may move over gradually as they see the
new chain gain acceptance, demonstrated by the higher trading volume on it.

I will assert that the block size is political because it affects nearly
all users to some degree and not all those users are technically inclined
or care to keep decentralisation in the current configuration as you do.
This debate has forgotten the current and future users of Bitcoin. Most of
them think the hit to node count in the short term preferable to making it
expensive and competitive to transact.
We all need a little faith that the system will reorganise and readjust
after the move to big blocks in a way that still has a reasonable degree of
decentralisation and trustlessness. The incentives of Bitcoin remain, so
everyone's decentralised decision throughout the system, from miners,
merchants and users, will continue to act according to those incentives.

The users of Bitcoin are living in a free world. Bitcoin like many
political systems requires the cooperation of the majority. If a majority
of miners decide to change the rules to benefit only themselves then the
system will quickly lead to collapse, until a new system arising from the
ashes of the previous one is erected.
In fact the situation is more optimistic than this. Miners don't set the
rules, the economic majority does. The miners must follow the rules that
are acceptable by the economic majority, or quickly go out of business.

Mike's position is that he wants the block size limit

your view that the block size should be artificially constrained below the
organic growth curve (in a way that will penalize a majority of existing
and future users) lies at the other extreme. The majority position lies
somewhere in between (i.e. a one-time increase to 8MB). This is the
position that ultimately matters.
If the block size is increased to 8MB and things get demonstrably a whole

always do another hard fork later to reduce the block size back to
something smaller, and henceforth the block size will never be touched

Not all markets need to have highly liquid trading outlets in order to be
thought of as such. Inefficient markets are where there is an imperfect
matching mechanism.
I don't think a fee market exists and that demand or supply are not easily
Demand and supply are reflected in the market in the following two prices:
- BTC/USD
- Average transaction fee levels * Average transaction volume rate. In
other words, this is the block-by-block, remainder of the block reward

To put some flesh on the bones of this idea, imagine a hypothetical
security named BLK. Demand for bigger blocks should buy up BLK and demand
for smaller blocks should short BLK. The price of BLK in BTC is the ideal
block size.
Now imagine that there are futures contracts for the security BLK. On the
settlement date of those futures the current BLK/BTC price of those futures
is taken to be the new Bitcoin block size for the next 3 months.
For instance, if I predict or want the block size to be higher on September
than it currently is, I would buy up September BLK futures. My actions
would nudge the price up, and if come September I am right I get what I
want and have a floating profit on the futures market.
The nice thing about a futures market is that it allows capacity planning
for the months ahead. Also there is no need for an underlying BLK security
for a futures market in BLKs to exist.
If the market is efficient and correctly sets the block size, BTC/USD will
rise and the BTC profits of the market participants will go up in USD terms
as a result.

Has there ever been any discussion of locking coins till a certain date for

Say that the date for counting votes is 3 months from now. Every one who
wants to cast a vote must lock coins until the vote closes (using CLTV). To
increase the weight of your vote, lock more coins. Write your choice in the

On the date the vote closes the nodes tally up the coin values for the
various vote options, and the choice with the highest total is the winner.
Not saying this could be used to solve the block size issue necessarily,
but we could have choices like:
1) Keep block size the same
2) Reduce block size by 10%.
3) Increase block size by 10%.

Thanks Mark.
Ok next obvious question (apologies for all of these but it seems you are
the authority on Lightning here). Is the Lightning system limited in the
number of hops there can be in the payment channel? I am looking at the
initial Lightning slides presented in February and it looks like the
locktime decrements by 1-day along each hop. So the more hops there are the
longer my bitcoins are potentially locked up for?

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] What Lightning Is 
Tom, my understanding is that the money that is debited from a payment hub
is simultaneously credited from either another payment hub or the person
making the payment, so that the net funds flow at a payment hub always sums
to zero. So no, there is no credit advanced by the payment hub to anyone.
Given Mark's previous answer of using CPFP and other tricks to pay for the
Bitcoin transaction fees, we can assume that Bitcoin fees do not play a
part in the payment channel balances.
So, the interesting question is what are the costs of running a payment
hub? The tx fees that a payment hub would have to pay to settle its Bitcoin
transactions would be passed on as a cost to the clients of the payment
hub. Also there is a cost to locking up funds in a payment channel (time
value of money). The lost interest or opportunity cost on those funds would
need to be paid for by its clients as well. And don't forget normal running
costs such as networking and electricity.

have to swallow all the costs of the hubs in the channel.

Bitcoin is imploding due to a failure of consensus. There has been a
failure of consensus on how to fix the design flaw evinced by the block

relying solely on altruism.
This is the root cause of the disagreement. Not on what value the block
size should be set to, a symptom and red herring. The whole argument
against a block size increase is the further reduction in the node count.
Therefore it makes sense to focus all energies on solving the root cause if
we are to save Bitcoin in the short and long run. It is tempting to toy
with the idea that a superior cryptocurrency which fixes the flaws can
supplant Bitcoin while it dies, but there is significant merit in the
suspicion that if Bitcoin fails the whole idea of cryptocurrencies will die
with it for another generation.
Below I will outline my thoughts on how Bitcoin can be improved so that
more people will be incentivised to run nodes.
1. The current incentive is run like a lottery.
Mining becomes more and more of a lottery the more value that Bitcoin
acquires. Prudent and rational people don't partake in lotteries as the
expected payoff is negative. Due to rewards at the block level, this leads
to a winner-takes-all situation, which leads to centralisation.
2. Decentralised proof-of-work is equivalent to value.
On 15 August 2015 at 18:43, Satoshi Nakamoto via bitcoin-dev <
being forced or pressured into it.
Proof-of-work is the basis of Bitcoin's security, which contributes to
Bitcoin's value. Further, the more decentralised that proof-of-work is, the
greater the value proposition of Bitcoin as a currency resistant to change
by coercion.
3. Importance of a public technical forum.
In order for there to be consensus, there must be a triumph of ideas over
people. Ideas are immortal, people are not. Also, pragmatism over idealism.
There must be no rank within the community, and no censorship or ignorance
of others no matter their past contributions. However, it stands to reason
that those who are more educated and experienced should be taken more
seriously than those who are not.
4. Stronger ties between transaction validation and proof-of-work.
As pointed out, mining in the pooled sense can be done without doing any
validation whatsoever. By tying mining with transaction validation, the two
must become inseparable.
The logical conclusion of this is that instead of mining blocks per se,
transactions must be mined individually.
5. Fees to be paid to nodes.
The incentive to run nodes shall be made monetary. All the reward is
currently going to those who do not really support the network.
50% of a transaction's fee should go to the node that mined the transaction.
6. The timechain.
Currently it is difficult to envisage anything other than grouping
transactions into blocks and timestamping them. The POW timestamping
service must have sufficient time gap between blocks.
Therefore as transactions are mined each one will have the possibility to
become a block in the timechain. The POW difficulty for a block will
obviously be much greater than the POW required to mine a single
This also requires every mined transaction to contain a block header, in
case it becomes a new block in the block chain. It will contain a prev
block hash, a merkle tree of mined transactions in the mempool, a nonce and
two separate coinbase addresses. One coinbase output will be used to pay
the miner of the transaction, and the other will also pay the miner the
(50%) transaction fees of the other transactions in the block, if the POW
on the transaction also satisfies the POW difficulty of a block.
7. Transaction POW difficulty.
Block POW difficulty can remain as it currently does, to produce blocks at
approximately 10 minute intervals.
Transaction POW difficulty affects the rate at which mined transactions are
Now, since each transaction contains a prev block hash an important
decision to make is whether to mandate that all transactions within a block
contain the same prev block hash, and that the prev block so referenced is
the immediate previous ancestor block, or whether any transaction may be
admitted into a block so long as the prev block referenced by the
transaction is any previous ancestor in the main chain.
If the former, then any transactions which don't make it into a block must
be re-mined for inclusion in the next block. Hence this more closely
enforces the rate at which transactions are mined and included.
The rate at which transactions are mined and included in blocks is
obviously proportional to the block size. The transaction POW difficulty
can be adjusted periodically so that the transaction rate or block size
follows a smooth trajectory and does not make any sudden jumps.
Greater decentralisation of POW leads to increased mined transaction rate
(given sufficient unmined transaction rate production). The inverse is also
true. Hence transaction rate and block size is proportional to degree of
8. Miscalleneous observations.
Nodes only need work on transactions if they are valid.
Mined transactions are a weak guarantee that they will be accepted by the
The originator of a transaction may self-mine his own transaction to avoid
paying some of the fee.
Transactions with higher fees and smaller size will be mined in preference.
Large block spam attack is expensive due to the POW needed to mine the
gigantic number of transactions.
Decentralisation of nodes is encouraged to be close to the location of real
transaction origination i.e. consumers. Unmined transactions may not be
relayed by a node if it chooses to work on it, if the fee is high enough.
Block-level reward is still a decentralised lottery. Transaction-level
rewards go to those running the network. Fees will go up as it will be the
nodes that are mining transactions that need to be individually
compensated, and not miners mining only block headers.

SPV is for checking validity of transactions that have already entered

validation by doing a POW on it.
If we stipulate that the coinbase fields only hold space for a single
pubkey, then the entire block header including the two coinbases
should only take an extra 100 bytes or so. Transactions are already
routinely 250 bytes+. So an increase of roughly 33%.

If you as an SPV node are waiting for unconfirmed transactions to be

transactions, decreasing the likelihood of receiving the mining

If Bitcoin Core loses miner majority to XT this is probably what it
will have to do to maintain security of its chain.

That guy is going to easily make back his 150 BTC with interest, if he
is short BTC. Should be a clear signal for the market to trend lower,
probably below $180 by the time of the test.

Uh, that would totally not work.
I think my proposal of using CLTV to lock coins (votes) is better.
Failing a soft-fork to implement that in time, counting votes from the
UTXO set is also ok - the difference between that and CLTV is that it
is not as strong an evidence of commitment.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Proposal: Requiring a miner's signature in 
A proposal for stemming the tide of mining centralisation -- Requiring a
miner's signature in the block header (the whole of which is hashed), and
paying out coinbase to the miner's public key.
Please comment on whether this idea is feasible, has been thought of before,
etc., etc. Thank you.
Mining is centralising to a handful of pool operators. This is bad for a
number of political reasons, which we won't go into right now. But I have
always believed that some years down the line, they could hold the users
hostage and change the rules to suit themselves. For instance by eliminating
the halving of the block reward.
Currently the block header is formed by the pool operator and distributed
hashing by the pooled miners. It is possible to divide the work among the
miners as the only thing that is used to search the hash space is by
a nonce or two.
I propose that we require each miner to sign the block header prior to
hashing. The signature will be included in the data that is hashed. Further,
the coinbase for the block must only pay out to the public key counterpart
the private key used to sign the block header.
A valid block will therefore have a signature in the block header that is
verified by the public key being paid by the coinbase transaction.
Work can no longer be divided among the pooled miners as before, without
sharing the pool's private key amongst all of them. If the pool does try to
take this route, then any of the miners may redeem the coinbase when it
matures. Therefore, all miners will use their own key pair.
This will make it difficult to form a cooperating pool of miners who may not
trust each other, as the block rewards will be controlled by disparate
and not by the pool operator. Only a tight clique of trusted miners would be
able to form their own private pool in such an environment.
Pooled hashpower, instead of earning bitcoins legitimately may try to break
the system instead. They may try a double-spending attack, but in order to
leverage the pool to its full potential the pool operator would again have
share their private key with the whole pool. Due to the increased
and coordination required for an attack, the probability of a 51% attack is
much reduced.
