@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] DOS-Attacks on bitcoin-client? 
I'm using your bitcoin-qt client (version 0.8.1). Normally everything is working pretty fine, but sometimes it seems that other nodes produce an enormous amount of traffic. I have not had the time to investigate thoroughly yet. I only have briefly viewed with tshark.
So far I have just restarted the client in the hope that it no longer connects with the 'evil' node. This usually works quite well.
Is anything about DOS-Attacks known to you?

See: I'm developing currently a LiveCD for hot/cold wallet management on

project. If there are better alternatives, let me know.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Update alert false positives 
bitcoin-qt produces on many systems an unnecessary alert:
"URGENT: Upgrade required: see Especially the stable channel is affected:
This is a bit frightening for normal users. I think the best would be to
turn off this message (if possible). It produces too many false
positives and motivates people to maybe harmful workarounds.

Sorry, I'm not a developer, but I have got a question. It's a little bit
off-topic and can't maybe answered easy.
As I understand this attack someone renames the transaction ID before
being confirmed in the blockchain. Not easy but if he is fast enough it
should be possible. With a bit of luck for the attacker the new
transaction is added to the block chain and the original transaction is
discarded as double-spend. Right?
Up to this point the attacker has nothing gained. But next the attacker
stressed the Gox support and refers to the original transaction ID. Gox
was then probably fooled in such cases and has refunded already paid
Bitcoins to the attackers (virtual) Gox-wallet.
So far everything is clear. But what I do not understand: Why apparently
had so many customers of Gox payment defaults or severely delayed
payments? I would imagine that the attacker may have doubled not only
his own transaction (maybe for obfuscating the fraud). But then all
transfers would still have go through anyway. And a normal customers
would have been satisfied. Most people observe only their wallets, I
think. What am I missing here?
Sorry, is perhaps a silly question. But maybe you can put me on the
right track.

Some believes it is possible that the email could be genuine. Some say
that only the content is important. I have closely followed. An
interesting discussion. Thank you all so far.
But let's say the poster would be the real Satoshi. Would we discuss his
posting if he would not claim to be Satoshi? There are a lot of smart
people on this list, which publish occasionally quite useful ideas. But
much of this is hardly the subject of greater discussion. Especially not
when it comes to the blocksize. On this subject almost everything has
been already said. But not yet by everyone. Especially not by Satoshi.
Satoshi would have a decisive influence on the community. I'm sure. To
say it does not matter who's talking is maybe genteelly but a little bit
remote from everyday life. Or not? Satoshi is the creator. What he says
is in the newspaper and is perceived by all. If he says it's okay to do
nothing as long as we stand together, then people have the courage to do
maybe something dangerous or something wrong. Then people only follow
their hearts. Otherwise they follow their fear. It is a paradox of the
human nature that some type of Dictatorship can make you free. I say
some type, not any type. Enough said.

Unanimity is mission critical for Bitcoin and must be an absolute
priority. If not the vast majority is in favor for a fork, then the fork
should be avoided until a consensus is found. Even if it takes until the
cows come home.
But it is very likely now that it will come to a fork. No matter which
site will win, this will produce a lot of humiliated people at the end.
That's not good and leads to bitterness on both sites.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Will there be a freeze of the current protocol 
BitPay seems to support BIP 101:
We do not know where this is going. But I suspect that ultimately also
the core client will increase the block size.
Bitcoin is also the subject of research. I think that research is much
to slow (and uncertain) for many companies and users. This is the
reason for XT. Nevertheless, I think further research on the base of the
current protocol version is very important. Thus, I hope that the
current block chain survives. Albeit at a lower level with fewer
users. And expressly not to sabotage necessary changes in the main project.
Let's suppose XT prevails or core is changed within the terms of BIP 101:
Do you think that there are enough people to continue with the old
protocol version? Would developers fork a Bitcoin client for supporting
the old nodes with security updates? Or will there be a compatibility
mode in XT, so that XT behave like an old Bitcoin node? What about
smaller but important projects like picocoin?

I really can not imagine that a 20-year plan will be successful. At one

thing for sure at the moment.
I hope that the current protocol and blockchain will be continued.
Perhaps with fewer people. That would settles the matter for the time
being. ;)

Am 21.08.2015 um 15:34 schrieb Will Madden:
As a protocol Bitcoin could support millions of full nodes. What you
talking about is the number of shareholders. But these are poorly
determined by the block size. The number of shareholders is determined
by many parameter but manly by the decreasing-supply algorithm. Which
"was chosen because it approximates the rate at which commodities like
gold are mined". See: While the decreasing-supply algorithm of Bitcoin has many advantage it's
very hard to believe that the block chain will ever reach mass adoption.
Even after 6 years, hardly anyone owns Bitcoins. Like Gold Bitcoin is
distributed in large blocks to a few. Exceptions prove the rule. In the
last 6 years the 1MB limit has been sufficient. I don't think that we
will hit the 8MB limit in the next 6 years, except for stress tests and
I don't think that a relative tight block size could harm Bitcoin
middle-term. Only experienced users penetrate the block chain directly.
They know what they are doing and deal with problems. When space for
transactions starts to become scarce and the fees rise too much, the
developers have enough time to make a change. It would then also not so
controversial. A matter of a few days or weeks. Especially if all
necessary preparations have already been taken.
But I know that my opinion is very different from other claims. However,
reliable people share some more fatalism as I'm currently find in some
parts of the the Bitcoin community. Fear is a very bad adviser and can
make a genius stupid.

It would feel better for me if you would keep the power of two:

For interbank trading that would maybe enough but I don't know.
I'm not a developer but as a (former) user and computer scientist I'm
also asking myself what is the core of the problem? Personally, for
privacy reasons I do not want to leave a footprint in the blockchain for
each pizza. And why should this expense be good for trivial things of
everyday life?
If one encounters the block boundary, he or she will do more effort or
give up. I'm thinking most people will give up because their
transactions are not really economical. It is much better for them to
use third-partys (or another payment system).
And that's where we are at the heart of the problem. The Bitcoin
third-party economy. With few exceptions this is pure horror. More worse
than any used car dealer. And the community just waits that things get
better. But that will never happen of its own accord. We are living in a
Wild West Town. So we need a Sheriff and many other things.
We need a small but good functioning economy around the blockchain. To
create one, we have to accept a few unpleasant truths. I do not know if
the community is ready for it.
Nevertheless, I know that some companies do a good job. But they have to
prevail against their dishonest competitors.
People take advantage of the blockchain, because they no longer trust
anyone. But this will not scale in the long run.
