@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] question about ProcessMessage() 
Hi, in main.cpp, ProcessMessage(), the line:
if (vAddr.size() < 1000) that appears at about line 3290
(not sure which, as I have made changes.)
What is the purpose of this line?
vAddr.size() was already checked at about line 3240, and if it was >
1000, the function has returned.
Is pfrom->fGetAddr allowed to be true iff  vAddr.size()==1000 ?
Could not find it in list archive.
