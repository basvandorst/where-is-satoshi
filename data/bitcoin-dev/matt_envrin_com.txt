Hi Matt,
I think your best bet is probably just push it out privately via blog post / Github, and see if it gains any traction with other developers.
I'm a little uncertain as to the relevance though.  All those variables (purpose, network, asset_type, account, change, index) need to be stored internally within the wallet database, as there's no way to retrieve the path used from just the address, correct?  In that case, what's the meaning of that exact path structure when a) it can't be retrieved from just the address, and b) the values will be stored internally within the wallet when you lookup the address.

Say you generate a child key using the path m/6'/4'/7'/99'/0/196, which is what your proposed path structure would be, and it results in the address 1DpY7PtPVURvjrGsdAjbZAZ7cL9GD8tc5w.
When the wallet notices a transaction in the blockchain that has 1DpY7PtPVURvjrGsdAjbZAZ7cL9GD8tc5w as an output, it's going to have to lookup the address within its database to get the values 6/4/7/99/0/196, as there's no way to retrieve them from just the address.  So technically, you might as well just use m/account'/change/index if using hardened child keys, or m/change/index if not, as recommended, because the wallet will still function the exact same way.
