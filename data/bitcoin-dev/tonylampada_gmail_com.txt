@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Crowdfunding Bitcoin development on 
Howdy everyone.
This is my first post on this lits, so please allow me to introduce myself.
I'm Tony, 31, software engineer, brazilian.
More about myself here  and
I'm reaching out to this list because I've built a free software
crowdfunding platform that you might find interesting/useful.
It's called FreedomSponsors - will you please take a look?
- - FS lets people place money bounties on issues of open source projects.
(like bitcoins issues listed at  If
more people have the same needs, they can "chip in" on that offer. Payments
are made directly to developer *after* the issue has been resolved (no
escrows involved).
Right now, the only supported payment option is Paypal, but I'm already
working on enabling the use of Bitcoin both as a currency and a payment
So, if you like it, feel free to use it, and maybe even contribute to it
(which is *very* welcome) - it's open source on Github -
If you have any feedback, I'm happy to hear about it.
