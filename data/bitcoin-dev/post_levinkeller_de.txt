Hear hear Tamas,
I agree. I personally prefer to use the "only-bigblocks" branch and not XT
with all its features - but as I am not mining that doesn't mean much
anyhow. Nevertheless I am happy to be able to publicly proclaim my opinion
that the block size should be raised asap.
Thank you for going ahead Mike

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Minimum Block Size 
Hey everyone,
as with the current "max block size" debate I was wondering: Is anyone here
in favor of a minimum block size (say 2 MB or so)? If so I would be
interested in an exchange (maybe off-list) of ideas. I am in favor of a
lower limit and am giving it quite a bit of thought at the moment.

Interesting. I am writing down something similar. Will share soon.

If someone could threaten the network by releasing a hard-forking bitcoind
version, then already all is lost. Bitcoins stability does not (and cannot)
depend on the "good will" of anyone. If it would, we should all abandon
this silly project. Relying on the good will of people is the worst idea
one could have.
So please (please please) go ahead and release your hardforking bitcoinds
you have been holding back. Competition is everything.

Dear Eric,
thank you for sharing your thoughts.
It obviously boils down to political beliefs, not so much technical
arguments. I understand that you are in favor of a "guided
decentralization" and you are most happily invited to follow this path. I
don't want to be on it. I want total decentralisation of bitcoin and many
other parts of the current system.
So in the end the hard fork might be perfect, because people like you will
not waste so much more energy and time fighting people like me (and others)
who are following different dogmata because we are using different coins
and talking about different code. Interestingly enough in the end we will
probably have a winner - determined by the price - so I am looking forward
to the outcome. It is just the time so make some bets, which I embrace.
Another interesting thing is, that you actually fear problems arising from
this. What do you have to loose? Just stick with the old bitcoin version
and weather this storm. Bitcoin is not going to vanish or break from this.
It is just forking. One fork will come stronger out of this. You just have
to choose a side and live with it, if you loose it all. But that is the
story of bitcoin since the beginning. If you ask me, you fear the choice,
not the change.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Export format for xpub 
Hello everyone,
I think this is my first email to this mailinglist so I will shortly
introduce myself:
I am Levin and the CEO of Coyno ( Based in Berlin,
mathematician. Bitcoiner since 2011.
And now the reason for this email: Andreas (Schildbach) just released a new
update of his wallet. It now provides an export functionality for the m/0'
key in order to run read only copies on other devices. We already support
the format on our website. Of course we would love for this to become
standard. I also updated the Wiki article for Andreas' Wallet:
How do you like it? How does this format get standard? Shall I try to get a
pull request to BIP32 passed?

Why even bother with the specific HD scheme such as BIP32  or BIP44. What
are the interesting parameters?
   - gap limit
   - which node of the derivation chain is actually exported (m0' for
   BIP32, m44'0'account' for BIP44)
   - which subnodes are used for external and internal purposes
   - creation date
To import the data in a read only application it is not important which
node one actually gets and in all implementations the subnode of the
exported node "0" is used for external addresses and "1" for internal
There is no usecase to export any higher node than m0' in BIP32 or
m44'0'account' as one can only derive any child nodes of the higher nodes *with
the private master key*. As for lower nodes (like further down the path)
there is also no need to export because in all implementations today they
will only give around half of the used addresses.
So I think a more general but very useful export scheme would be:
bitcoin-pub-export:xpub[gibberish]?gaplimit=[number]&path=[path in
derivation tree]&subchains=[numbers]&creationdate=[unixtimestamp]
Why not have more descriptive parameters? Saving on data?
I am a big fan of unix timestamps. Would vote for Andreas' format on the
creation date.
