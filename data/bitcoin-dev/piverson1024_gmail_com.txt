I agree with Greg.  What is happening is a cause for celebration: it is the
manifestation of our long-desired fee market in action.  That people are
willing to pay upwards of $100 per transaction shows the huge demand to
transact on the world's most secure ledger. This is what success looks
like, folks!
Now that BTC is being phased out as a means of payment nearly everywhere
(e.g., Steam dropping BTC as a payment option) (to be replaced with the
more-suitable LN when ready), I'd propose that we address the stuck
transaction issue by making replace-by-fee (RBF) ubiquitous.  Why not make
every transaction RBF by default, and then encourage via outreach and
education other wallet developers to do the same?
The frustration with BTC today is less so the high-fees (people realize
on-chain transactions in a secure decentralized ledger are necessarily
costly) but by the feeling of helplessness when their transaction is
stuck.  Being able to easily bump a transaction's fee for users who are in
a hurry would go a long way to improving the user experience.

Allowing a "no-RBF" flag serves only to fool new users into believing that
0-conf is more secure than it is. There is already too much confusion about
this point.
In Bitcoin was assume that miners are profit-maximizing agents, and so we
must assume that (flag or not) miners will replace transactions from
mempool with conflicts paying a higher fee. From that viewpoint, full RBF
is already "de facto" policy in Bitcoin. So I agree with Luke and Peter:
remove the flag and make all transactions RBF as "de jure" policy too.
At the same time, we need more outreach and education to clarify the risks
of 0-conf, and we need to show miners how they can earn more profits by
adopting full RBF.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Hard fork proposal from last week's meeting 
Thank you for the proposal Wang Chung!
It is clear that, spam aside, blocks are getting full and we need increase
them soon. What I don't like about your proposal is it forces all node
operators to implicitly accept larger blocks in 2020, even maybe against
their will. 32 MB blocks might result in a loss of decentralization, and it
might be too difficult to coordinate for small blocks before it's too late.
So I think Core can't decide on hard forks like this. It must be left up to
the users. I think only choice is for Core to add a run-time option to
allow node operators to increase block size limit, so that this very
controversial decision is not coming from Core. It must come from the
