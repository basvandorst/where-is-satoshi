The problem with this is that you might have word A which is similar to B,
but B is also similar to C.  So we scrub B from the list, someone enters B,
and we have no way to know if it means A or C.  It leads to a much more
complicated scheme to ensure that all errors are correctable.
Scrubbing A, B, and C is preferable, since it leads to no ambiguity and
there is no need to try to correct an error.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Message Signing based authentication 
This was one of my concerns when implementing a scheme where you sign a
refund transaction before the original transaction is broadcast.  I
originally tried to pass a hash and have the server sign it.  However, I
had no way to know that what I was signing wasn't a transaction that was
spending my coins!  So I changed the code to require sending the full
transaction, not just the hash.  The other way to mitigate this is through
not having any unspent outputs from this key.
For authentication, you could have both a user-generated and
server-generated portion, so that you signed something that clearly had
data from you, so even if the server-data was a hash of $EVIL_DOCUMENT, you
have clear plausible deniability in that your data that is also signed is
"ATTEMPTING LOGIN TO XYZ.COM Hash($EVIL_DOCUMENT)".

I actually had a use case in my case where it was possible, and that was
the check I used to get around it, just configured it so that I always
generated a new key when I needed to set up a 2 of 2 Multisig Refund Tx.
 It was either that or making sure I had no unspent outputs.  The use case
of doing it was laziness in just creating a single key.

Required vs. strongly recommended is an important distinction.  Satoshi
Dice reuses EC Keys for every single transaction.  Exchanges will have the
same address you deposit in over and over, which gets reused.  This is a
best practice argument rather than a protocol requirement.

I also would prefer to go straight to uBTC as the "standard wallet unit".
 It works out perfectly with Satoshi's being the decimal units.  Something
that costs $10USD would be 25000uBTC.  This isn't a problem for a place
like South Korea, where 10USD is about 10,000 Won, so we aren't even off on
a scale of usable currencies in major economies.
The downsides are obviously confusion (causing mistakes resulting in lost
coins), and possibly from a psychological perspective on price (uBTC are
worthless!).  On the other hand, it also might help people feel like they
are getting in on the ground floor still (I own 100,000 uBTC!), and reduce
the perception the Bitcoins are not divisible (I have heard several people
worry that 21 million is not enough units).
Alan's ideas for compatibility with multiple fields will also be helpful to
solving the confusion issue.

I think formalizing the specification could go a long way and encouraging
alternate implementations is going to be the best way to reduce unexpected
small bugs having a bad effect except on the "buggy" node.
That being said, it's a huge chicken and egg problem.  No one wants to go
off the reference client since it could lead to working on a forked chain
as a miner or having bad data as a client.
I don't know if there is a good way to try to take small pieces, get
consensus, possibly have some type of universal test cases and running on
testnet that would solve the problem.
I wouldn't mind taking on parts of this when I have time, specifically

While that solution does work for many use cases, it does make it much
harder to do anything needing chained transactions.  Granted, this is the
short term solution for current implementations, but having a transaction
identifier that does not change does open up other use cases.
For example, Alice wants to send coins to a multisignature address with
Bob, such that both parties are required to spend the coins.  Alice also
requires for Bob to send coins to this address as well before they will
proceed.  Alice cannot guarantee that Bob will cooperate (and vice versa),
so before she broadcasts the transaction to send to A+B, she sends Bob a
transaction that spends her incoming transaction back to herself, but has a
time lock of far into the future.  Bob signs this, returns it to Alice, and
she broadcasts her funding transaction.  At this point, Bob disappears,
loses his key, or just decides to spite Alice and her coins are locked.
 Since she has a refund transaction, she can broadcast it in a month and
get her coins back.  Except her funding transaction has been modified such
that the txhash is different, so her refund is now invalid.  She would need
Bob to issue a new refund as soon as her funding transaction hits the
blockchain if it is modified, which defeats the point of the trustless
refund transaction.
Longer term it would be more ideal have a canonical identifier for the
transaction before it even gets to the chain to support these use cases,
even if wallets are able to properly identify the status of it's
transactions.  Obviously this is a difficult problem to solve and cannot be
implemented without breaking changes, but it would be a nice goal to be
able to completely remove malleability.  There are other important use
cases where having a unique identifier just for internal accounting is

This is somewhat problematic in my use case since some parts need to be in
the chain earlier than others and have the same ID as expected.
I haven't gone back to see if there are any ways around it, but the main
problem here is I need the Contract TX to be in the chain much earlier than
redeeming, but I need the refund transaction to be in the chain much
earlier.  Perhaps there are some tricks to pull off to get it to work, but

Mike is making an assumption that is not necessary, which is the price of
the most commonly used unit should be between is $.50 and $1000.  The issue
to revisit or not shouldn't require $1,000,000 Bitcoin price.  Typing a ton
of decimals is incredibly annoying.  Doing the mental math in my head is
annoying.  Even if a cup of coffee costs 3.12345 mBTC, that's a lot more
annoying than 3123.45 uBTC.
The points that people liked mBTC better than BTC doesn't mean anything
when comparing uBTC to mBTC.  Many people just stopped thinking at the mBTC
level, do not understand the implications involved in switching to uBTC, or
even considered uBTC.  The idea that we can just poll what people want to
give them the ideal experience is also flawed, in that users often don't
know what they want until they have it in front of them.
There is basically no downside to uBTC, except a few places already
switched to mBTC.  For exchanges, which are dealing with decimals since
they will do BTC/USD rather than the opposite, it might make sense for them
to continue to use mBTC or BTC.  For wallets and prices for users,
especially when there are large decimals since the price is still based on
more stable currencies, then converted to Bitcoin, let's switch to what is
I haven't seen a single good argument for keeping it in mBTC (other than

It certainly is not subjective, in that people are far more used to dealing
with whole numbers than decimals.  Try reading the first one, then reading
the second one.  Tell those numbers to someone else, have them write it
down, and see how many people screw up the first vs. the second.  This has
nothing to do with whether it "looks expensive".  There are reasons for
wanting the numbers to be higher as well, as evidenced by the number of
Dogecoin enthusiasts who like "having more", even if it doesn't matter.
 That part gets more subjective, but still favors micros in most cases.
 Sure, 3000 may sound like a lot, but if you have a lot more, it's all a
different scale.
If the argument is for keeping things based on what is already done, why
even switch to millis?  After all, everyone is used to full Bitcoins, why
even change to millis?  Whatever your arguments are there, for switching
base bitcoins to millis, try to see why they fail at micros (other than the
subjective argument that I'm used to decimal units of currency being worth
a cup of coffee, even though numerous people all over the world don't have
that conditioning).

Fairly useless experiment, since the vast majority of users will almost
always stay at the default.  The winner will always be whatever was
selected as the default initially.  This might work if the default was
randomly chosen, and you see what actually annoyed users enough to switch
off of it most often.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] New BIP32 structure 
For every branch (say multiple accounts), how would a new wallet be able to
know how many sequence items to scan?  It seems like not only do you need
to have standard rules for the hierarchy, but how the usage can be
detected.  The other scanning seems pretty straightforward.  For accounts,
it seems like you could have a situation where you want to initially set up
10 different accounts, but only account  gets any transactions.  If a
new wallet was trying to scan with this seed, it would have to know to keep
scanning each account until it found the account.  The user would have to
be responsible for knowing how many accounts there are, or some rules would
need to be in place to not allow creating accounts until earlier accounts
can be proven to have existed in the blockchain.  Or I am missing something.

Don't most of these coins have a magic number already assigned that is
unique? (0xD9B4BEF9 for Bitcoin, 0x0709110B for Testnet, FBC0XB6DB for
Litecoin, etc...).  This seems like a good candidate for identifying coins,
and also supports Testnet cases well.  Maybe there are some alts without
such a magic number that might prevent that?

@_date: 2014-03-27 11:13:46
@_author: Allen Piscitello 
@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] New BIP32 structure 
The idea was to use the magic number as the source for cointype.  If it's
too big, as Tamas showed, perhaps a hash of it, and for coins without a
magic number, a hash of their name (or some unique identifier).
That being said, I agree with Andreas that something that is 90%
inter-operable seems very dangerous and will give people false expectations
when they miss the corner cases.  If the structure isn't going to be shared
completely and have all support shared, having it completely incompatible
along with a mechanism for converting part of it to another wallet seems
superior.  The worst types of losses will occur when someone tests out
something with a limited use case, sees that it appears to work, makes
dangerous assumptions, then gets burned when it's too late.

The benefit I see is avoiding reuse of keys between coins while not having
each wallet implementation have to know about each coin in order to scan
for transactions.  Wallet X supports Doge and Bitcoin.  If both used a
shared sequence of keys, say the first two end up Bitcoin, then 10 Doge,
then some more Bitcoin.  If you took this seed to Wallet Y, which only
supports Bitcoin (either the wallet's support or what is installed on the
system it's being used), it will see a gap of 10 addresses, and presume no
more scanning with a 5 gap limit.  The alternative is to reuse keys for
each coin.
It also seems like a solution might be to only expect interoperability on a
single sequence, and provide backups of each final sequence to use between
different wallet implementations.  This allows flexibility in hierarchies
depending on needs and support of wallet, but allows sharing.  The short
seed would only be useful for the same wallet, but sharing between wallets
would use the longer keys.  That will give predictable behavior for users
(although less friendly) and lead to less errors.
