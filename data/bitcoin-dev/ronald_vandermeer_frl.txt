@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Suggestion to remove word from BIP39 English wordlist 
Hello guys,
After reviewing some bitcoin improvement proposals, I noticed that one of the words that can be found on the BIP39 English wordlist is ?satoshi?. I suggest removing this word from the list so it?s less obvious that it?s a bitcoin seed when found by a malicious third party.

That convention would be the alternative to BIP0039 I am referring to.
I would disagree here:
All that really would need to be done is select another word that is not on the 2048 list, and then agree that by convention,  the words 'satoshi' or the alternative word will represent the same number on the list. It seems to be to be a fairly simple thing to implement.
