@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] SPV bitcoind? (was: Introducing 
I should introduce myself. I am the BitcoinKit developer. If you can call that way a dude that wrapped up already existing code for Mac developers easier to understand and use :-)
I'm replying mostly because libcoin is something that I would like to have a closer look at.
Problems I've encountered with it so far are as follows:
1. It uses QT.
Well. It's a lib. Or at least I've thought it was. But it seems that I really need it to compile it. Dunno why yet.
2. Steps to create xcodeproject doesn't work
For some reason when I've tried to follow steps to create an xcodeproject from the cmake, it failed.
3. It doesn't compile at all
Even after installing QT libs and using cmake to compile it from the terminal? it fails on bitcoind.cpp. My assumtion is that cmake or not - it uses llvm to compile the stuff.
Because of the templates that bitcoind is actually using that's not gonna work ever. That's why BitcoinKit is a separate dynamic library that's compiled with gcc (or at least llvm pretending to be gcc ;P)
Michael, have you tried to use your sources on Mac OS X recently? It seems to be a bit? outdated.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Tor and Bitcoin 
Hi everyone,
We at Hive had plans to make our wallet proxy through Tor by default. When it became apparent that this was not presently possible because bitcoinj lacks SOCKS support, it opened a minor discussion suggesting that this is perhaps not advisable practice for SPV wallets in the first place. To quote Mike Hearn:
While the scenario outlined seems unlikely, it's best to be prepared... What do you all think? How can this be done properly?
As we said to Mike, if Thailand has actually made Bitcoin illegal, then packet filtering may not be far off for certain regions, and it would nice to be proactive and prepared. At the moment, Thailand already has cruder, URL-based filtering... But vendors like Cisco are no doubt constantly selling them on the virtues of more advanced censorship technologies.
Gregory Maxwell is the person who wrote the hidden service support for bitcoind, right? It might be interesting to get his comments here. grabhive.com ( | twitter.com/grabhive ( | gpg: A1D5047E

Apparently that won't help. That's just embeding the existing tor code and rerouting internal Cocoa internet communication via tors proxy.
What guys need is bigger configurability in tor itself. I can understand that. It's doable tough.
