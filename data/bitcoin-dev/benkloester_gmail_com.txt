Something similar to this has been proposed  in this article by Ron Lavi,
Or Sattath, and Aviv Zohar, and discussed in this bitcoin-dev thread
They only discussed changing the fee structure, not removing the block size
limit, as far as I know.

Is there a contingency plan in the case that the incumbent chain following
the Bitcoin Core consensus rules comes under 51% attack?
If the 2x fork really does have the support of >66% of miners (which
remains to be seen), it seems like they'd have spare capacity to perform
such an attack. In which case, a rushed hard fork might be the only option
to guarantee the survival of the chain, would it not?
I'm aware of Luke's work on BitcoinHardfork
, but not aware of whether this has
actually been tested in the field by anyone - ie whether anyone actually
has even run the code much / created a testnet. What are the options for an
emergency hard fork, and how much testing has each seen?

Mark, this seems an awful lot like an answer of "no", to my question "Is
there a contingency plan in the case that the incumbent chain following the
Bitcoin Core consensus rules comes under 51% attack?" - is this a correct
In fact, beyond a no, it seems like a "no, and I disagree with the idea of
creating one".
So if Bitcoin comes under successful 51%, the project, in your vision, has
simply failed?

I don't get it. At the moment, the number of Bitcoin is fixed (at 21
million) by the geometric decay of the block reward.
Adding any other means of creating coins besides the existing block reward,
or altering the block reward schedule, is extremely likely to be seen as
messing with fixed supply. And not adding another method to create coins
wouldn't work - because then redemptions would have to come out of miner's
block reward, which I don't imagine they're going to share just because you
The only way you might convince users that adding a second way to mint
coins is not messing with fixed supply, is if there is some kind of proof
that the number of coins being minted is accounted for by past burnt coins.
We could call this 'regeneration'. But then you also need a way to prevent
double-regeneration, in which the same burnt coins are used as proof twice.
And you would also need per-sidechain accounting, so that you can't just
regenerate burnt coins that were originally burnt for sidechain A when all
you have is coins on sidechain B. But where to put all this logic? Building
a system that enforces the accounting for sidechains into Bitcoin, as Lucas
pointed out, is not much different to just building the sidechain itself
directly into Bitcoin.
And if you did assemble all that, what you have anyway is a two way peg,
which I suspect will be isomorphic to the very sidechain proposals you seem
to be criticising/attempting to do better than.

So you are essentially imagining that a perpetrator will combine the
crypto-nerd fantasy (brute forcing the passphrase) *with* the 5-dollar
wrench attack, merging both panes of Randall Munroe's comic? Seems
vanishingly unlikely to me - attackers are generally either the wrench
type, or the crypto-nerd type.
This thread started by you asking Pavol to give an example of a real-life
scenario in which this functionality would be used, and your rebuttal is a
scenario that is even less likely to occur. "Very dangerous" is a huge
When living in Brazil I often carried two (IRL) wallets - one a decoy to
give to muggers, the other with more value stored in it. I heard of plenty
of people getting mugged, but I never heard of anyone who gave a decoy
wallet getting more thoroughly searched and the second wallet found,
despite the relative ease with which a mugger could do this. I'm sure it
has happened, probably many times, but point is there is rarely time for
contemplation in a shakedown, and most perpetrators will take things at
face value and be satisfied with getting something. And searching a
physical person's body is a hell of a lot simpler than cracking a
Moreover, there's no limit to the number of passphrases you can use. If you
were an atttacker, at what point would you stop, satisfied? After the
first, second, third, fourth wallet that you find/they admit to owning?
Going beyond two is already Bond-supervillain level implausible.
