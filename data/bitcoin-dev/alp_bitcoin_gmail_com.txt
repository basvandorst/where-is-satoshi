This proposal seems hopelessly broken.
Who decides on which companies are eligible?  Is there some kind of
centralized database that one registers?  Who administers this?  What is to
stop someone from creating a million fake companies to sway the voting?
How does a company make it's vote?  How does one verify that the person
voting on behalf of a company is actually the correct person?

These are non-answers.  Someone must decide.  Someone must decide what kind
of company counts (e.g. does a dark market seller count as a business?
Does some guy who sells $10/year worth of goods using Bitcoin count the
same as large companies like Coinbase/BitPay/Blockstream).  Someone must
decide which websites are checked for votes or addresses.  Someone must
decide if a rogue employee made a transaction on behalf of the company or
Registering domain names is trivial and can be automated if the incentives
were needed for it.
You mention developers who have commit access.  This excludes the vast
majority of developers.  You also don't mention which repositories count.
Do the developers of bcoin count or not?
These questions all would need to be answered before any kind of proposal
like this can be taken seriously.  Without these kinds of answers, this
proposal is far from complete.

10% say literally never.  That seems like a significant disenfranchisement
and lack of consensus.

Doing nothing is the rules we all agreed to.  If those rules are to be
changed,nearly everyone will need to consent.  The same rule applies to the
cap, we all agreed to 21m, and if someone wants to change that, nearly
everyone would need to agree.
On Feb 8, 2017 10:28 AM, "Andrew Johnson" It is when you're talking about making a choice and 6.3x more people prefer
something else. Doing nothing is a choice as well.
Put another way, if 10% supported increasing the 21M coin cap and 63% were
against, would you seriously consider doing it?

varies depending on the context (95%, 75%, 51%). Nowhere does it say
"everyone needs to agree".
There's a pretty huge gap between 90% and nearly 100%.  90% excluding 10%
only 7 times results in only 48% of the original base.

Your definition of forward may be different than other users.
Yes, I chose Bitcoin because it relies on a strictly held consensus
mechanism and not one that changes on the whims of the majority.  We have
tens of dozens of political currencies for that.
increase it when we needed it.  The white paper even talks about scaling to
huge capacity.  Not sure where you got the idea that we all agreed to stay
at 1MB forever, I certainly didn't.  It was never stated or implied that we
could change the coin cap later(please cite if I'm mistaken).
The community has not agreed that it is needed at this time.  Perhaps they
will change their mind at some point in the future.  We have also learned a
great deal since the publication of the initial whitepaper, such as the
unstable state without a backlog or subsidy.  Fortunately, participation in
this system is voluntary, and you are free to leave at any time.
This seems to be venturing quite off topic, and perhaps would be better
suited for the bitcoin-discuss list.

I fail to see how any non-mining user can attack a miner.  The worst they
can do is refuse to buy their coinbase transaction.  Do you believe that
users are obligated to buy coins from miners?  If not, then all miners are
voluntarily choosing a set of rules to enforce and a set of policy to mine.

Can you outline how a minority of hash rate can attack a majority? Users
are free to follow tighter rules than before, or they may reject it.  The
majority of hash rate can continue the old rules or not.  Where is the
attack?  I see a disagreement being resolved peacefully through unilateral
through changes in the same UASF way. I?m very happy that UASFs can?t work
because that would be the end of Bitcoin's freedom and decentralized nature.
Governments would be much more equipped to simply go directly to the miners
to enforce this for them - why even bother with millions of distributed
miners when you can knock on a few doors and get your policy?

This unnecessarily complicates transaction selection for miners by
introducing a second (and possibly third if I understand your proposal
correctly) dimension to try to optimize.
See:  Segwit already solves this exact issue by replacing block size with block
weight, so I fail to see how this proposal would make any improvements
without introducing significant complications.

As a user, I would far prefer a split over any kind of mandatory change
that would drastically harm the ecosystem.  Many users feel the same way.
Level 3 is a pure attack on users who do not conform to your beliefs.
Please do not put words in people's mouths claiming they wouldn't prefer a
split when many would.  If you wish to fork off, please do so responsibly.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Hard fork proposal from last week's meeting 
What meeting are you referring to?  Who were the participants?
Removing the limit but relying on the p2p protocol is not really a true
32MiB limit, but a limit of whatever transport methods provide.  This can
lead to differing consensus if alternative layers for relaying are used.
What you seem to be asking for is an unbound block size (or at least
determined by whatever miners produce).  This has the possibility (and even
likelihood) of removing many participants from the network, including many
small miners.
32MB in less than 3 years also appears to be far beyond limits of safety
which are known to exist far sooner, and we cannot expect hardware and
networking layers to improve by those amounts in that time.
It also seems like it would be much better to wait until SegWit activates
in order to truly measure the effects on the network from this increased
capacity before committing to any additional increases.

I suggest you take a look at this paper:
  It may help you form
opinions based in science rather than what appears to be nothing more than
a hunch.  It shows that even 4MB is unsafe.  SegWit provides up to this
8MB is most definitely not safe today.
Whether it is unsafe or impossible is the topic, since Wang Chun proposed
making the block size limit 32MiB.
Wang Chun,
Can you specify what meeting you are talking about?  You seem to have not
replied on that point.  Who were the participants and what was the purpose
of this meeting?

That is not a suggestion.
Wang - still waiting on the details of this meeting.  In the spirit of
openness, I think you ought to share with the community what kind of secret
meetings are happening.

I'm not sure what the data you present has to do with the discount.  A 75%
discount prevents witness spam precisely because it is 75%, nothing more.
The current usage simply gives a guideline on how much capacity is gained
through a particular discount.  With the data you show, it would imply that
those blocks, with SegWit used where possible, would result in blocks of
