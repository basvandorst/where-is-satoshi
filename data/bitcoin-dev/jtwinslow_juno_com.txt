@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Why Satoshi's temporary anti-spam measure isn't 
Regarding the block size increase, at least conceptually it seems to me there should be an easy solution. If we look at what works well with bitcoin, for example the block reward halving and difficulty regimes which due to their step function nature both contribute to the stability and predictability of the bitcoin universe while still allowing for the necessary dynamic adjustments. It seems to me there should be a corresponding and equally simple solution for the maximum block size.
I've never quite understood the supposed rationale behind the proposals for a new static maximum of 20 MB or 8 MB or 2 MB other than it would be trivial to implement. Why not come up with an equally simple, predictable dynamic function consistent with what is already proven to work in the bitcoin universe that would both preserve the scarcity of transaction capacity to encourage a fee market but also allow for more transactions when needed.
For example how about something like once every month at month-end, take the 6-month average non-zero transaction fee block size and multiply by 1.5?
With the # of transactions increasing then plateauing you arrive at a constant excess capacity of around 33%:
MO    ABS    MBS    EX CAP
1    750    1000    25.0%
2    775    1000    22.5%
3    800    1000    20.0%
4    825    1000    17.5%
5    850    1000    15.0%
6    875    1219    28.2%
7    900    1256    28.4%
8    925    1294    28.5%
9    950    1331    28.6%
10    975    1369    28.8%
11    1000    1406    28.9%
12    1000    1438    30.4%
13    1000    1463    31.6%
14    1000    1481    32.5%
15    1000    1494    33.1%
16    1000    1500    33.3%
17    1000    1500    33.3%
18    1000    1500    33.3%
Similarly, in a declining then plateauing # of transactions market you also arrive at a constant excess capacity of about 33%
MO    ABS    MBS    EX CAP
1    750    1000    25.0%
2    725    1000    27.5%
3    700    1000    30.0%
4    675    1000    32.5%
5    650    1000    35.0%
6    625    1031    39.4%
7    600    994    39.6%
8    575    956    39.9%
9    550    919    40.1%
10    525    881    40.4%
11    500    844    40.7%
12    500    813    38.5%
13    500    788    36.5%
14    500    769    35.0%
15    500    756    33.9%
16    500    750    33.3%
17    500    750    33.3%
18    500    750    33.3%
With some simple statistical analysis, one could easily arrive at a statistically-inferred excess capacity linked the to probability of transaction volume exceeding the new cap in any forward monthly interval. In the tables above, I have used my own intuition that people seem to be generally comfortable with excess capacity of >= 33% and become less so at < 33%.
A scheme like this would have multiple benefits:
1) Adapts predictably and automatically to both rising and declining market demand for transactions
2) Preserves the fee market with a constant target excess capacity
3) Monthly adjustment interval and six month lookback allow for sufficient time to plan for changes in system capacity
In the case where transaction volume spikes such that it exceeds the monthly limit, the fee market would then take over to ensure high priority transactions get through fastest. In the case of malicious activity, such an attack would have to be maintained for well over a month to significantly adversely affect the maximum block size. As long as there is a non-zero cost to such attacks, the likelihood of maintaining one for a period of months decreases significantly.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Let's deploy BIP65 CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY! 
Two observations from a Bitcoin investor and non-programmer:
1) I think it's possible that those who are adamantly opposed to a soft fork may be largely (if not completely) correct on purely technical terms, but that they also may be underestimating the risk of a contentious hardfork.
2) The downsides of a softfork are unclear because they seem to be based primarily on inelegant coding, not that it couldn't be made to work.
As a Bitcoin investor, I am becoming increasingly concerned that the rancorous and mostly unproductive debates occurring here daily are slowly closing the window of opportunity for Bitcoin to succeed. If this were a start-up or public company, the stock would be plunging. Why? Simple. Uncertainty. While I think (and I'm sure most here would agree) that these debates are necessary (and due to Bitcoin's decentralized nature perhaps even necessary to have in a public forum) but when these debates go on and on indefinitely thereby reducing confidence in Bitcoin's future something different needs to be done. In a public company or startup these debates would be happening in private with a an eye on competition, public/market perception, timing and anticipation of a shareholder-value-increasing outcome followed by a press release or marketing campaign. And the clock is always ticking.
My suggestion is the top devs from both sides need to get together offline and decide what the best compromise would be and then publicly promote a non-contentious solution that balances the technical with market concerns that everyone can get behind. Continuing to debate technical issues ad-infinitum without compromise or waiting until the Hong Kong conference in December to start making a decision while Bitcoin dies on the vine should not be an option. If anything, the conference should be the time at the end of which a confidence-inspiring technical roadmap is announced.
Further, I would like to add that in my perception what Bitcoin needs to and can easily become is essentially a public utility/backbone blockchain (like IP is to the internet) upon which all current and future blockchain stakeholders should see as their best and cheapest option for entering the space. For this to happen Bitcoin, from a user's standpoint needs to be simple and reliable, and from an investor/developer standpoint cost-effective and scalable. I don't see why this can't happen.
