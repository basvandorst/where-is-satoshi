I agree, it looks very slick.  Well done.
While on the subject of connected peers, what about the idea of adding the ping time from this node to other peers?  The problem with fitting that information into the current design is that the graphs seem to be comprised of overall statistics for this node, not per-peer statistics that can vary between peers (such as ping time).  If a line were to be added to a graph to represent each peer's ping time, the number of lines (statistics) on the graph would have to vary in real time as peers are added or removed, which would be a challenge.
I earlier added the "ping" feature to bitcoind, and it works to measure the ping time, however this feature is on-demand: it won't ping other nodes unless requested.  So, something would have to send the "ping" RPC command on a regular schedule, to ensure the graph is updated with new information.  Also, there is currently no support for overlapping pings (although that would be easy to add), so if a peer is slow enough to not respond at all to the first ping request, and a second ping request goes out in the meantime, any late response from the first ping request would then be discarded.
Great graphs, and these are just brainstorms for future ideas :)

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] replace-by-fee v0.10.0rc4 
Probably out of my league, but I will respond here anyway.
I am in favor of replace-by-fee, but only if it were to be applied to a very limited subset of transactions: namely, transactions that seek to supplement, not replace, the original transaction.
In other words, a replacement transaction would only be accepted if it were adding additional value (additional transaction inputs and/or outputs).  Otherwise, the original transaction would stand.  Reducing any of the promised outputs, or diverting them to some other recipient, would not be allowed.
This would solve the problem of a stuck transaction: a transaction that is taking seemingly forever to confirm, because one forgot to pay the miner?s fee, something that happened to me once.
Stuck transactions are bad, both for the recipient (they aren?t getting paid) and the sender (some of their funds are still tied up, because change from that transaction has not returned yet).
With replace-by-fee, the sender of a transaction can send it again, with additional inputs (to pay more miner?s fees) and additional outputs (to receive the change, if any is desired, from those inputs).  So, now the sender is self-empowered to ?shove through? their stuck transaction, by voluntarily choosing to pay more for it, a market-driven solution to the problem.
There are really good reasons to not allow replace-by-fee as a general policy that can apply to all transactions, as others have already mentioned.  However, I still believe the idea has merit, for this special limited case of supplementing a transaction.
