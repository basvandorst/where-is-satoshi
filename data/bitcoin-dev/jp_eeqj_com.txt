@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Serialised P2SH HD chains 
What is the use case for something like this?  It?s my impression that a single token that can be used to obtain many P2SH addresses paying to a multisig script looks something like
   bitcoin:?r=
As it?s impossible to actually transmit a tx without network access, why would it be necessary to, at payment time, not contact the payee and use the existing bip70 authenticated payment request protocol to find out exactly what multisig address they?d like paid at that moment?
The model that you describe where a payer can, without communication with the payee, generate additional multisig p2sh addresses based on a set of xpubs presumes that the payee would never want to e.g. cycle their own keys or change their cooperating multisig participants? keys.  Is this wise?
Lately I?ve been thinking of bitcoin addresses (even multisig) as sort of MX records - something that the paying user shouldn?t depend on being static, because they are derived from keys that may change (or be lost or compromised) over time.  The canonical ?pay me at this address forever QR code? should be a bitcoin: URI that points to a payment request generating URL, should it not?

To clarify: the raw bytes of the public key itself, not the ascii base58 representation of the pubkey hash - right?

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Bitcoin governance 
If people attempt to govern Bitcoin, Bitcoin falls apart.
That's why there is no voting and there are no unnecessary hard forks; Bitcoin operates on consensus.
Engineering and research along these lines is folly, as any attempt to impose such concepts as "voting" will rightfully find itself with nothing to govern.
It is a common misconception that the core devs govern Bitcoin; indeed they are the core devs only because they do not try to govern. I urge you to review the history of the term "unix" for an instructive example of what happens in systems that do not depend on consensus. And now back to regularly scheduled development, I hope.
PS: A personal request to the list: could we please limit ourselves to posting about the research and development of Bitcoin Core? Many of us must stay continually abreast of all progress on Bitcoin Core by reading all of -dev daily and subjecting everyone's email inboxes to hundreds of pet theories about governance and block size opinions without patches or simulations is simply abusing the list membership to soapbox. I encourage you to make blog posts instead and post them to /r/Bitcoin or suchlike versus taking up attention span on an *engineering* mailing list.

It seems to me that FSS RBF must enforce identical OP_RETURN data on the output scripts as the first seen transaction, as well, to safely continue support for various other applications built atop the blockchain.
Is there a canonical implementation of FSS RBF around somewhere I can review?

According to this post, it is possible to configure Google Calendar to show an additional time zone to your localized one, and GMT/UTC is indeed in the list.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP Proposal - Address Paste Improvement 
One can also make the argument that if the user's clipboard is able to be read/modified, then their working environment is already compromised and that the responsibility is already not upon specific application software, but the user or OS.
Down here in the real world, an application that does not support copying and pasting of addresses is not an application that is very useful (to say the least) to many people who want to manage their own wallet, though I understand your desire to avoid such.  Perhaps offering alternatives such as supporting signed BIP70 payment requests is what you mean to do.
That said, I still think working around specific malware threats and vectors isn't the application's job, especially when doing so for a tiny, tiny fraction of users that have malware outweighs the needs of the 95%+ that need to support the "I have an address on my clipboard I need to pay" case.
