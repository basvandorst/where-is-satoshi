@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Let's deploy BIP65 CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY! 
I agree with Mike Hearn that there is no consensus on using a soft fork to
deploy this feature. Either everyone agrees that we should all agree on
consensus or else there is arbitrary disagreement. You cannot have it both
It is very important that we reach consensus on consensus or, if you will,
meta0consensus. I think we should Do nothing as that is clearly the choice
that we have taken re: blocksize. If we use one set of rules for that
decision we should use the same set of rules for all decisions and there is
no middle ground.
Thank you.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] This thread is not about the soft/hard fork 
For soft forks, consensus is required. In fact, we (today) have miners who
individually choose to mine blocks that are completely empty, with no known
input from (or communication with) the outside world. This is a consensus
process. Users can switch back and forth all they like, and this only
happens when there is unanimous miner-developer consensus. Most of the time
they don't even know, that they are under consensus.
It is only "controversial hard forks" which DON'T require wide agreement
and developer endorsements. Hear me out.
This is because, with zero dev-agreement, we have two benefits: first,
there are tremendous security issues which can be fixed by trying more than
one hard fork at once (these fixes can prevent loss of funds), and, second,
because each fork is equally Acked and Nacked (a Schrodinger's Ack, if you
will), they will have equal standing, and therefore users will be equally
indifferent to both forks and they will both live for a long time (and
users will be able to pick the fork that best fits them, empowering the
People have overlooked how simple this issue is because of the political
climate. We need a climate change, pardon the pun.

Really great stuff, Mr. R! We can use differential equations to measure
centralization pressure (I'm pretty sure, good idea). If we want
decentralization (or even mere stability), we must impose a
counterbalancing rule such that each past commit makes one *less* likely to
get their next commit pulled. For example, a "one man one commit" policy.
Yes, this is essential. Greg, stop making it so hard for me to  determine
the evolution of Bitcoin by making it hard to express my vote based on the
code I choose to run. Blockstream is always doing that I am sick of it.
Mr. R really understands these concepts at a deep level and people need to
pay more attention to what he has to say. Nash equilibriums are very
important mathematical concept, for example:

I think I can solve the debate and give everyone what they want.
Some people want BIP65, others do not.
We can roll out 65 in a clever way, such that Greg/PeterT can get it, but
Mike and Peter R don't need to have it (both versions can run alongside
each other). Even better, people can switch back and forth between versions
as much as they like.
How might this work? Well, paradoxically, we could do this by *imposing
additional constraints* on transaction validation, such that transactions
made a very specific certain way will always look valid to non-CLTVers, but
for CLTVers they will not be valid unless the CLTV rules are followed. The
obvious concern is that non-CLTV people might receive invalid payments.
However, their software is already set up to request payments in a non-CLTV
way, so, luckily, this is actually not a problem at all! SPV clients can
elect to only connect to nodes which are non-CLTV.
Problem solved!
I am happy to have solved this problem for you all, and ended this discord
harmoniously. If we all put our heads together, these words of founding
father Aretha Franklin will ring true: "there's nothing we can't overcome".

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Public Debate Challenge 
I disagree.
Therefore, we do not have a consensus.
As there is no consensus, you need to do one of two things:
1) Post a 10 page, 5 paragraph persuasive essay about how you are a Traitor
to Consensus, and do it
loudly on Reddit, MySpace, LinkedIn, etc, so that everyone in the community
is correctly informed.
2) Do nothing.
This is a very logical argument and is of the utmost seriousness, as what
Peter[:-1] is doing is a threat
to Consensus, which is the very foundation of Bitcoin. These are related
I question Peter[:-1]'s motives and hereby challenge him to a public debate
with the following conditions:
- - The subject is Bitcoin.
- - The debate may take place at any time at any place.
- - You will not know that the debate has begun until it is over.
