@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] MultiSig request URI proposal 
I have an idea that subject.
There are already BIP 21.
But Multisig request URI is non exist.
My idea is below:
rawtx: raw transaction (encoded by base64)
- pubkey={{public key for sign key pair}}
- hd_wallet_position={{path for HD wallet position}}
This URI scheme is used for multisig request from website to user's local
How do you think ?
