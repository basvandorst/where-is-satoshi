Hash: SHA1
I agree that a unit based on 1e-6 BTC is easier to use in practice
than BTC. The name microbitcoin is ok-ish. Nearly all countries
officially use the SI-system, but that doesn't mean that the average
citizen knows all the SI prefixes. Mega, kilo and milli are
universally understood, micro not so much. This is a serious
accessibility concern.
But I dislike the term bit for the already stated reasons: It's
already used in various languages for various things. Simply using
Satoshis may be easier and is universally understood.

Nearly every payment system in existence has this problem: you have to
be able to enforce the contract out-of-band. The scenario you describe
is no worse than a payment network with instant, secure confirmations
because Alice could just as well refuse to make the second payment.

By my interpretation of RFC 6838, the Bitcoin Foundation or even Gavin himself could register a vendor tree for Bitcoin. In the case of the foundation registering, getting the subtree named vdn.bitcoin should be no problem.
It's mostly about the good feeling of having followed the rules and proper procedures, I doubt that there is a difference in practice

There are reasons to have assertions enabled by default in software like
Bitcoin Core, where incorrect behaviour can be costly. But this comes at
a prize: our assertions have to satisfy certain performance
requirements. It's no longer possible to do expensive, redundant checks
in performance critical code, which is one of the main advantages of
asserts. Imho, asserts are not intended for small range checks etc, but
are meant for checks that a hash hasn't changed, that a tree structure
is still a tree, that data is still sorted, or that data structures are
in sync.
I think most concerns about the current use of asserts would be resolved
if the currently used asserts would be changed to a nicer definition
which is independent of NDEBUG, and a second class of debugging asserts
would be introduced, which is exclusively for expensive, redundant
checks and is disabled by NDEBUG.

As you said, that's in the US, and I strongly suspect the sole reason
is that in the US the currency symbol is written in front of the
amount. I often pronounce $10k as ten kilodollar, using it exactly
like a SI-prefix.
The much better argument against SI prefixes is that the prefixes for
values less than 1 tend to be much less well known: Most people know
that kilo means 1000, many know that mega means 1,000,000, but few
know that micro means 0.0000001, and those that do tend to confuse
micro and nano.
