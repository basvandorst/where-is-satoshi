What is Bitcoin if not decentralized?
Bitcoin the most awkward, unprivate and damaging currencies ever
created.  It is terribly slow for general use, and it is very
difficult for users to get over the technical hurdles required to use
it safety.  It is simultaneously the least private payment system ever
conceived for general use, yet still manages to consistently help
terrorists and pedophiles.  Over half a gigawatt of power is used to
power the miners which timestamp the network, causing hundreds of
millions of tonnes of CO2 and radioactive particles to be spewed into
the atmosphere.
Perhaps we can justify these damages as the cost of decentralization,
similar to one justifying the tor anonymity network as having
significant positive effects outweighing the negative.  However if you
are truly willing to give the goal of absolute decentralization up as
unachievable or unrealistic, it would be much more sensible to replace
the entire Bitcoin network with a couple of geographically distributed
SQL servers and call it a day.
Without decentralization as an ultimate goal, Bitcoin is an
abomination that is best dismantled.

Proof of work is probabilistic transaction ordering (and timestamping
by extension), the only perceivable value in it is that it is
decentralized. If you don't have that set as a requirement there are
plenty of companies around who will act as a time stamping notary for
you, just as there are many cloud services around to host the SQL-
based Bitcoin replacement.

The justification for the existence of Bitcoins hinges on it.  What is
described in the whitepaper is a system without the trust of third
parties to process electronic payments, this can not exist without
decentralization.  Absent any unforseen revelations this is a
requirement rather than a suggestion or fleeting fancy.  Below a
decentralized Bitcoin you are free to make systems as centralized as
you please without affecting the parent, below a centralized Bitcoin
there is no room to make it less.  We really only have one shot at a
properly bootstrapped, decentralized currency, and it would be a great
shame to mess up the one we have with hasty decision making for
unclear goals.

Decentralization is a ubiquitous term within the Bitcoin, and the
definition is by no measure new or often confused.  It is realizing
that systems involving trusted third parties have undesirable
properties, be it regarding privacy, fraud, censorship, and removing
the effect of them as much as is physically possible.  WASTE and
RetroShare are examples of decentralized messaging and file
distribution systems, acknowledging the privacy problems involved with
centralized systems like AOL Instant Messenger or IRC.
Bitcoin is a decentralized currency which allows any person the
ability to transact in a way that does not require specific trust in
any particular party.  Users can independently verify that
transactions they receive are valid and confirmed, with strong
confidence that they can not be reversed or modified.  A third party
does not hold these same properties, there is no reason to believe the
information they present other than trust they will not lie, cheat, or
violate privacy at their own will.  Given information by a trusted
third party (such as a balance or existance of transaction), a person
has no ability to independently validate their claims as you do in a
decentralized system.

That would be incredibly foolish given the history, where even heroic
attempts at making consensus compatible re-implementations have ended
rather poorly.  bitcoin-ruby and btcd have collectively had numerous
consensus failures, some only recently found by fuzzing the scripting
environment.  There are more failures than publicly disclosed, and
almost any failure can be leveraged to split the network and steal
money.   Ethereum attempted to create four clients, written to a
defined specification, and even with all the money in the world has
managed to have numerous consensus failures due to misunderstanding or
Gavin clearly hasn't kept up with the ridiculousness of that task.

You are describing the essence of sidechains.  You might want to check
out Elements Alpha, which has some outrageous experimental changes to
transaction structure.  It's a technical Bitcoin sandbox which doesn't
require launching yet another altcoin.

I don't think code quality is of a particular problem in alternate
implementations, the difficulty of getting it right is simply
astronomical.  If you attempt to re-implement just transaction
signature verification you run into edge cases remarkably quickly,
most use of Bitcoin today barely scratches the surface of what was
added to Bitcoin for future expansion.

For the purposes of the conversation this was only brought up to re-
enforce my claim that this is outrageously difficult software
development, irrespective of the quality of the code being produced in
alternate implementations.  Sorry if that came across as an attack
against your software in particular, it wasn't intended.
The point I was trying to make is that this is simply a hard
development situation to be working in, we don't know what behavior is
inferred by the use of CPP and even more so OpenSSL (as the DER
encoding consensus failure made abundantly clear).  There's almost
certainly more problems lying around given how generally dusty a lot
of the transaction environment is, it's very easy to get off the
beaten track with Bitcoin script.

The only implementations with any significant network presence are
btcd and Bitcoin Core, fuzzing them should be sufficient if these
services are doing validation of transactions using one of the two.
For example two of the ones you have linked are based in Insight,
which uses Bitcoin Core for validation.  If they aren't validating
transactions before broadcast they won't make it more than a single
hop through the P2P the network so they are of minimum concern.

There's no requirement for there to be multiple interpretations of the
consensus code, this is why libbitcoinconsensus exists.  Why do you
think Bitcoins survival is predicated on reimplementation?
I'm aware that these problems apply to Bitcoin Core.
