@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] standardize on bitcoin signed ecies ? 
Does anyone see a value in a standardized PGP-style message,
which would allow someone performing a bitcoin transaction to
send signed encrypted messages using only public and private
bitcoin keys ?
I'd like to propose a signed encrypted message protocol, in case
someone see's value in encoding such a thing into a BIP.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] bitcoind as a library 
Two minor observations:
DecodeBase58Check is listed as inline, but isnt actually inlined in the
This makes it both non-present in libbitcoin_common.a and unavailable
to other code that would use libbitcoin_common.a as a library. (bug?)
In general, the hierarchy of tools is poor/weak. for example base58.h could
be a fairly
independent low level math/string library, but it includes caddress, which
requires chainparams, and makes the whole dependency tree quite involved...
Is there an intention that the various internal libraries could/should
be strengthened and heirachicalized such that they would be suitable for
3rd party development of bitcoin related services and tools, or is that not
a goal, and some other project would have to fill such a role ?

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] cryptographic review requested 
I've made a proposal for a standardized ecies scheme for bitcoin
communication. To address gmaxwell's criticism, I'd like to also
follow up with a proposed change to BIP44, such that a structured
wallet would also include a series of identity keys, both addresses
which will be used for signing, and public keys which would be used
as destinations for encrypted messages.
If anyone is familiar with ECIES and would be interested, there is a
working implementation at which also includes this whitepaper:
Abstract This document describes a scheme for sending signed encrypted
messages using bitcoin public and private keys. Motivation PGP and
Bitmessage and other secure communications channels exist. This standard
allows for secure messaging using a bitcoin wallet alone, without the need
for other software. This standard allows the owner of an address to
conveniently prove ownership to the holder of another address privately
without the need for separate secure communications channels. Specification:
Message Format In the rest of this text we will assume the public key
cryptography used in Bitcoin. The || operator is concatenation. All
operations are defined over binary, and not text conversion of the data.
When serializing public keys the compressed encoding is always used, even
if the input parameters are passed as uncompressed. Bitcoin addresses are
always serialized from compressed public keys, and for mainnet. (directives
to use testnet or uncompressed keys ignored) String literals are
represented as if for the C programming language in native UTF-8. No
assumptions are made about the payload message format, it may even be
binary. Caveat Decryptor. Plain unformatted text message payloads are
recommended to use utf-8.
   - CompactSize format is a variable size little endian length field
   serialization format, know as a bitcoin "Variable length integer"
   - CompactSizePrefix(X) = CompactSize(X) || X
   - QTHASH(x) = SHA256((SHA256( CompactSizePrefix("Bitcoin Signed
   Message:\n") || CompactSizePrefix(x) )
This standard assumes the reader is familiar with the bitcoin compact
signature format, which is a 65 byte signature which allows the verifier to
recover the public key associated with the signature, eliminating the need
to send it with the message. Once consequence of this format is that
signatures of tampered messages will nearly always result in some public
key, but it will not be the same as the orignial signing key. The address
of the sender will be provided to enable validation of the signature. The
format is a 1 byte recid, followed by ECDSA R then S values.
   - CompactSign( PrivateKey, 32 byte QT Hash ) == 65 byte message
   - CompactVerify( 65 byte message, 32 bytes Hash ) public key counterpart
   of (PrivateKey)
   - ECIES with HMAC_SHA256 for mac, PBKDF2 for KDF
   - PBKDF2 is used with 2048 iterations, salt=( "Bitcoin Secure Message"
 ecies_nonce_publickey )
   - AES is used with 256 bit keys, and CFB mode, with a 128 bit feedback
   buffer. No padding or envelope, simply a pure byte cipher
   - compact_signed_message = 0x01 || CompactSizePrefix(M) ||
   Sender_Address || Signature
   - compact_unsigned_message = 0x00 || CompactSizePrefix(M)
   - Secure message format: ECIES( compact_signed_message or
   compact_unsigned_message )
Summary of the functions defined:
   - eM = SendMessage( M, Signing_Key, Dest_Pub )
   - M,Sender_Address = ReceiveMessage( eM, Decrypting_Key ) It is
   acceptable for deterministic nonces to be used for signatures, however
   nonces generated for ECIES must be high quality random bytes. (excepting
   unit test vectors)
Message Sending Inputs:
   - The message to send "M" (treat as precise binary bytes, no space
   stripping or normalization)
   - The bitcoin private key "Signing_Key" to be used to sign the message
   - The bitcoin public key "Dest_Pub" to be used as the destination of the
   message Algorithm Calculations:
   - Calculate the QTHASH(M) to obtain "M_hash", 32 bytes of data
   - if signing Sign with CompactSign(Signing_Key,M_hash) to obtain
   "Signature", 65 bytes of data ** Calculate the compressed address of
   Signing_Key to obtain "Sender_Address" 21 bytes of data ** Serialize 0x01
 CompactSizePrefix(M) || Sender_Address || Signature to obtain
   "Signed_Message"
   - if not signing, instead Serialize 0x00 || CompactSizePrefix(M) to
   obtain "Unsigned_Message"
   - Generate 32 random bytes "ecies_nonce_bytes"
   - Generate a bitcoin private key from ecies_nonce_bytes, "Nonce_Key" 32
   bytes of data (retry if invalid)
   - Derive the compressed public key of Nonce_Key, "Nonce_Pub", 33 bytes
   of data
   - ECMultiply Dest_Pub by Nonce_Key to obtain the point
   "Shared_Secret_Point"
   - Serialize Shared_Secret_Point as a compressed point "Shared_Secret"
   - Derive "KeyingBytes" = PBKDF2( Shared_Secret ) to get 80 bytes of data
   - Directly Derive "AES256_Key" from the first 32 bytes of KeyingBytes
   (index 0 to 32)
   - Directly Derive "HMAC_Key" from the second 32 bytes of KeyingBytes
   (index 32 to 64)
   - Directly Derive "AES_IV" from the last 16 bytes of KeyingBytes (index
   64 to 80)
   - Encrypt Signed_Message or Unsigned_Message using AES256_cfb_128 using
   AES_IV and AES256_Key to obtain "Encrypted_Payload". Same length as M
   - Compute the HMAC_SHA256 of Encrypted_Payload using HMAC_Key, truncate
   to the first 8 bytes to obtain "Message_HMAC"
Serialization output
   - Serialize Nonce_Pub || Encrypted_Payload || Message_HMAC to obtain
   "eM" For text transmission eM may be sent encoded with base 64, otherwise
   binary is preferred.
Message Receiving Inputs:
   - The message received "eM" (decode from base64 if needed)
   - The bitcoin private key "Decrypting_Key" to be used to decode the
   message Algorithm Calculations:
   - Deserliaize eM to recover "Nonce_Pub", "Encrypted_Payload", and
   "Message_HMAC"
   - ECMultiply Nonce_Pub by Decrypting_Key to recover
   "Shared_Secret_Point"
   - Serialize Shared_Secret_Point as a compressed point to yield
   "Shared_Secret", 33 bytes of data
   - Derive "KeyingBytes" = PBKDF2( Shared_Secret ) to get 80 bytes of data
   - Directly Derive "AES256_Key" from the first 32 bytes of KeyingBytes
   (index 0 to 32)
   - Directly Derive "HMAC_Key" from the second 32 bytes of KeyingBytes
   (index 32 to 64)
   - Directly Derive "AES_IV" from the last 16 bytes of KeyingBytes (index
   64 to 80)
   - Compute the HMAC_SHA256 of Encrypted_Payload using HMAC_Key, truncate
   to the first 8 bytes to compare with Message_HMAC
   - If the Message_HMAC did not match, the message is corrpted so abort
   - Decrypt Encrypted_Payload using AES256_cfb, AES_IV and AES256_Key to
   recover "Payload_Message"
   - Verify that the first byte is a 0x01 or 0x00, else abort. 0x01
   indicates signed
   - if signed Deserialize "Payload_Message" to obtain "M",
   "Sender_Address", and "Signature"
   - if not signed Deserialize "Payload_Message" to obtain "M", and return
   M
   - Calculate the QTHASH(M) to obtain "M_hash", 32 bytes of data
   - Call CompactVerify(Signature, M_hash) to obtain "Signing_Pubkey"
   - Calculate the compressed address of Signing_Pubkey to obtian
   "Sender_Address_check" 21 bytes of data
   - Compare Sender_Address_check and Sender_Address, if they are not
   identical, fail/stop
   - Output Sender_Address to indicate who the mesage is from, and that the
   signature is valid and untampered with
   - Output M, considering it is valid and the content untampered with
Test Vectors By convention keys will be in WIF format, public keys in
base58_check format, messages in c style UTF-8 string literals. Encrypted
messages are in Base64 format. Compliant implementations will use random
nonces from a cryptographically strong DRBG. For the units tests, they will
be provided in hex format. The nonce bytes provided are to be used both for
the ECIES ecies_nonce_bytes, as well as for the Signature algorithm. Test

If anyone is interested in using a bip44 Wallet to generate
deterministic GPG identities, I have implemented a demonstration in
this allows a user to manage a GPG identity for encryption
and signing with zero bytes of permanent storage. (on tails for example)
Paper is here still:
One minor correction added which specifies that the smallest S value
should be used, to prevent different ecdsa implementations from creating
non-canonical/identical outputs.
comments welcome
