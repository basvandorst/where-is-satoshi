@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] OP_CHECKWILDCARDSIGVERIFY or "Wildcard Inputs" or 
content, a bitcoin address could accumulate a dozen of transactions
before the webmaster changes the address to a new one.
Would this use case be a better match for something such as stealth
addresses or hierarchical deterministic addresses?

This is quite off topic, so please consider another channel. As long as you
have my attention, I previously started a cryptographically secure RPS game
as a proof of concept.
Unfortunately, I do not have the time to develop it at the moment, but you
can message me off the channel if you would like to discuss things further.
Thank you,

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP Number Request: Addresses over Audio 
Would it be feasible to transmit an entire BIP21 URI as audio? If you were
to encode any extra information (such as amount), it would be useful to
include a checksum for the entire message. This checksum could possibly be
used instead of the checksum in the address.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP proposal: Increase block size limit to 2 
I would say that a company's terms of service should include their position
on this issue. It does not seem reasonable that they all are required to
provide access to coins on every single fork. Are custodial wallet users
also entitled to Clam, Zcash, and Decred, and others?
Regardless, I think this thread should be about the technical merits of the
BIP. Discussion of hard forks would be better held elsewhere.

will not be orphaned unless they are intentionally segwit-invalid (which
they currently are not). If you have told miners otherwise, let me know.
He stated that "any invalid blocks they produce" will be orphaned. This is
not false. If non-upgraded miners do not produce blocks that are invalid
per the new rules, their blocks will not be orphaned. This is consistent
with Peter's comment.
