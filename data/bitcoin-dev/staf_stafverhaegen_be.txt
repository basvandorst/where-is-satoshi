What annoys me are people that seem to think that in order to promote
layer two scaling on-chain scaling has to be severely limited. I am
convinced that in order for layer 2 to flourish enough on-chain
bandwidth has to be available, not artificial scarceness.
In order to allow more on-chain bandwidth also sharding solutions should
be investigated so not every transactions has to pass through each node
and without the need of channels but protocol between nodes.

In order to evaluate this statement the definition of microtransaction
has to be defined. I guess there will also be no consensus on that...

I'm thinking more of a system where different nodes can agree to do part
of the transaction processing. In that way 20000 nodes could work like
5000 full nodes.

Everything is relative. Some months ago I did some investigation and
Bitcoin mining used lees energy than the diesel used by the gold ore
mining industry...

What on first sight seems trivial may be totally different when looking
deeper. People here seem to not realise that a lot of data centers (the
IAAS ones) just are just grouping the computers and provide remote
access. The client have full control over the machines. The center thus
just provides the hardware, the power and the internet access. They
typically don't inspect your internet traffic only reduce the speed if
you are going above certain threshold. Additionally there are countries
like Iceland that specifically make laws to not let the government get
power over data and network traffic in data centers.
Domestic ISP services typically want to prioritize traffic and thus have
most of the time network traffic deep packet inspection (DPI)
capabilities. These are thus much easier forced by government to filter
certain traffic. Additionally these companies often fall under
telecommunication laws also given government more control over them than
in a typical data center.
I host my Bitcoin node in a German datacenter and am sure it is more
censorship resistant that a node going through any American ISP.

Yes, DRM for example.
