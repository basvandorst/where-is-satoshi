It depends on how clever the spammers get encoding stuff. If law enforcement forensic tools can pull a jpeg header + child porn out of the blockchain, then there's a problem that needs mitigation.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Service bits for pruned nodes 
One of the technologies that can be borrowed from Bittorrent (besides downloading from multiple peers at once) is analysis by clients of the part distribution, which allows a client to download and share the least-propagated parts first to maintain high availability of the whole file, even when not one individual currently has downloaded the complete file (the seed has left the swarm).
Unlike Bittorrent, a partial-blockchain swarm client needs to make informed decisions about how much to download, such as rules like "until it sees at least 20 complete blockchain-equivalents in the swarm", "until it has 10% of the blockchain itself", "work backwards, all blocks from the hash tree required to verify my payments" or other minimums that might all be criteria.
Bittorrent only considers directly connected peers' piecemaps when making decisions of what to download. Bitcoin, however, already has a protocol to allow peer discovery beyond the connected nodes; this could be extended to communicate what parts the peer is hosting. Careful thought into attack vectors would need to be paid in design, so that only a majority of outbound-connected peers's advertisement are able to inform consensus about part or peer availability, messages able to remove a peer or part availability from other's lists are confirmed independently without such removal verification generating DDOS traffic amplification, lying clients can be marked as discovered by the majority, etc.
Such thought doesn't have to be paid if directly implementing Bittorrent, but it has the burden of centralized trackers or expensive DHT, and it also doesn't have any logic informing it besides "don't quit until I get the whole file".

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] btc name server 
Namecoin already has an id/ and a/ (alias) namespace for such use:
{ "name" : "id/pichler", "value" : "\"BM-GtK6TiTtVo9toGVdk2zy3t4jGXZyZeMH\"", "expires_in" : 29397 },
{ "name" : "id/pigeons", "value" : "{ bitcoin: 1BekNv7ezkx8eAjdkrUta2BTp9bbxU9LGG, bitmessage: BM-opfhTsUKdTezPiWFHxRQtM1ZMDvjKMkHf, ripple: rnziParaNb8nsU4aruQ
dwYE3j5jUcqjzFm}", "expires_in" : 10089 },
{ "name" : "id/pisces", "value" : "\"BM-GtK6TiTtVo9toGVdk2zy3t4jGXZyZeMH\"", "expires_in" : 32034 },
{ "name" : "id/plattler", "value" : "\"BM-GtK6TiTtVo9toGVdk2zy3t4jGXZyZeMH\"", "expires_in" : 30999 },
{ "name" : "id/pope", "value" : "{\n   \"bitmessage\"    : \"BM-2D7L1Suh1choaKt321Le3bS6PT6nxfWqpR\"\n}", "expires_in" : 29765 },
It's popular enough that it's been squat spammed by a few actors recently, and several bitmessage IDs are there along with Bitcoin addresses, etc.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Warning: many 0.7 nodes break on large 
It was reported that not all 0.7 died from the BDB error either. This will likely take a post-mortem to determine exactly what build environments and versions are incompatible, by feeding each the bloated block (hopefully there are lots of snapshots of the bad chain being the best height for testing; I forgot to get one).

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] A bitcoin UDP P2P protocol extension 
My first concern was that I and about everyone else only has TCP/UDP port forwarding, but at least for the first:
UDT uses UDP to transfer bulk data with its own reliability control and congestion control mechanisms. Multiple UDT flows can share a single UDP port, thus a firewall can open only one UDP port for all UDT connections.
The latter appears not so friendly to NAT.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] 0.8.2rc1 - testnet datadir behavior 
Testnet glitch, something broke...
Fired up 0.8.2rc, and .... where's the coins? Where's the blocks?
I get a new empty datadir/testnet3 subdirectory.
bitcoin-qt.exe -datadir=c:\testnet (with a testnet=1 bitcoin.conf file option in that directory) stored wallet/blocks/chainstate in the root with previous versions. Now the root datadir data is ignored (except the config file) and a new hierarchy was created in subdirectory So what's happening?
This looks to be done by  ... after searching the code for the change and then finding the commit.
1 day from opened to committed, released six days later... no changelog.
The datadir previously worked as I expected with both bitcoin-qt and bitcoind interacting with no problems, when simply specifying a command-line datadir, so I don't see the bug.
I can see how the previous behavior might be dangerous if the config file was removed. I just did that, and there's a cool freakout where my testnet wallet balance looks like real BTC and Bitcoin tries to reorg 67662 blocks starting from the genesis block. After receiving real block 73354 per debug log, a nice unrecoverable crash:
"Assertion failed!"
File: src/main.cpp Line 1745
Expression: pfork != NULL
This needs to be added to the changelog, since dropping in this binary will break testnet stuff if anybody is using Bitcoin this way for their testnet faucet, etc:
" * testnet data now stored in testnet3 subdirectory, enforced even when specifying datadir on command line (manually move your data first)"
