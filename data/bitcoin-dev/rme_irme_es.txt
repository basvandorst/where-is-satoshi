@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Proposal: Encrypt bitcoin messages 
I believe that all comunications should be encrypted by default, no matter
that is public information (tx info), the only exception I would make would
be block packets (to avoid increasing propagation time).
I suggest that Bitcoin Core should generate a public/private key pair and
share the public one with peers.
This could provide privacy and integrity but not autentication.
This way you can impersonate a bitcoin node (active mitm) but you cant just
be passive and record all transactions send or recieved by an IP address.
Today you can just watch for incoming/outgoing transactions to determine
what tx are created in the Node, when you find one you can see the Bitcoin
address inputs and outputs and track that person's bitcoins.
As an example, SSH provides this kind of encryption, althogh Bitcoin Core
should ignore fingerprint changes (caused due to reinstalls).
Please feel free to disqus why this is not needed or why you like this idea.

Only messages between peers are encrypted, only during transit.
Before sending a transaction to Node B you use his public key, so Node B
has the key

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Possible attack: Keeping unconfirmed 
I dont know if this attack is even possible, it came to my mind and I will
try to explain it as good as possible.
Some transacions keep unconfirmed forever and finally they are purged by
Bitcoin nodes, mostly due to the lack of fees.
Alice is selling a pizza to Bob, Bob is now making the payment with Bitcoin.
The main goal of this attack is to store a unconfirmed transaction send by
Bob for a few days (it will not be included in the blockchain because it
has no fee or due to other reason), Bob might resend the payment or might
just cancel the deal with Alice.
Bob forgets about that failed trade but a couple of days later, Alice, who
has stored the signed transacion, relays the transaction to the network (or
mines it directly with his own hashpower).
Bob does not know what is happening, he believed that that transaction was
"canceled forever", he even does not remember the failed pizza deal.
Alice has now the bitcoins and Bob does not know what happened with his
This might also work with the Payment Protocol because when using it Bob
does not relay the transaction to the network, its Alices job to do it,
Alice stores it and tells Bob to resend the payment, Bob creates another
transaction (If has the same inputs as the first TX this does not work)
(this one is relayed by Alice to the network).
Alice comes back a couple of days later and mines with his hashrate the
first transaction (the one she didnt relayed to the network).
Alice now has two payments, Bob does not know what happened.
I hope that I explained well this possible attack, I dont know if there is
already a fix for this problem or if it is simply impossible to execute
this kind of attack.
Thanks for your time.

Alice does not intercept the transaction, she only saves it and expect that
it will not be confirmed (because has 0 fee for example).
Also using the Payment Protocol I believe that Alice is the only person
that can relay Bob's transaction.

I believe that the Payment Protocol works that way, the merchant broadcast

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Proposals for improving Bitcoin mining 
First of all I apologice due to the possible mistakes in my writing below,
I am not a Bitcoin developer but I have some knowledge about it.
We all know the recent news, Ghash pool controlling 51% of the hashrate.
While some consider it a threat others think that is not harmful.
The thing is that we have to do something to stop this from happening again.
My proposal is to start thinking about miners that join a pool like
independent miners and not slave miners, this includes creating a new
mining protocol that does not rely on the pool sending the list of
transactions to include in a block. Each individual miner has to collect
transactions by his own and mine that, this can be achieved by running a
full node or by running a SPV like node that ask other nodes for
Once this protocol is developed and standarised we as a community could
require all pools to use it (because its better, because is more
trustless...), not by imposing it but by recommending it.
Pool owners could send some instructions using this protocol to the miner
about how many transactions to include per block (some pools want small
blocks), how many 0 fee transactions to include, how much is the minimum
fee per Kb to include transactions and some info about the Coinbase field
in the block.
This way is impossible to perform some of the possible 51% attacks:
   - A pool owner cant mine a new chain (selfish mining) (pool clients have
   a SPV or full node that has checkpoints and ask other peers about the
   length of the chain)
   - A pool owner can't perform double spends or reverse transactions (pool
   clients know all the transactions relayed to the network, they know if they
   are already included on a block)
   - A pool owner cant decide which transactions not to include (but they
   can configure the minimum fee).
   - A pool owner cant get all the rewards by avoiding other pools from
   mining blocks (Because the pool client knows the last block independently
   that is from his pool or other).
The only thing that a 51% pool owner can do is to shut down his pool and
drop the hashrate by 51% because he does not control the miners.
If the pool owner owns all the hardware in the pool my proposal is not
valid, if the pool clients dont use this protocol my proposal is not valid.
I want to know if this is possible or its been developed or there is
already a working protocol that works like this, also I want to read other
people's ways to address this threat, thanks for reading.

But miners dont want to run full nodes, its better to develop some SPV like
that connects to some nodes.
Also I believe that stratum mining protocol improves some performance
things that GBT lacks.
If a new protocol that requires blocks created by miners is developed and
named in a cool way, miners could ask for protocol support to his favourite

About the small number of bitcoin nodes:
Hi, I read the message that Mike Hearn sent to this mailing list some days
ago (2014-04-07 11:34:43) related to the number of bitcoin full nodes.
As an owner of two Bitcoin Nodes, one in my home computer and one in a
dedicated server, I believe I can contribute with some of my thoughts and
- Allow users to view the bandwith used by Bitcoin Core:
This is available in the Bitcoin Core GUI (btw, when the computer is
restarted the data gets reseted) but I cant find it in the bitcoind
commandline, people that run nodes want to see the amount of GB that they
have "donated" to the network.
- Educate users about the correct setup of a bitcoin node:
Add a page in the bitcoin.org website with a tutorial about running Bitcoin
Core with the ports opened, about runing bitcoind, etc. This guide shoud
not be for regular users but for advanced ones.
- bitcoind and Bitcoin Core should create a bitcoin.conf file on the first
The first time the software should create a default config file with a
random RCP password and username (user can change it later) and the config
file should be commented so the user can know how to change configurations.
This is very useful in setups without GUI, for example in Ubuntu Server.
- bitcoind and Bitcoin Core should be in Linux repos:
People want to type "yum install bitcoind" or "apt-get install bitcoind"
and install bitcoin. No one wants to follow a tutorial made by somewho
saying that you have to add external repos to install bitcoin in your
For example Electrum has been added to Ubuntu software center recently.
Bitcoin Core an bitcoind should be on CentOS, Debian, Ubuntu and Ubuntu
Server repos.
- Create a "grafical interface" for bitcoind on Linux servers:
Create a command, for example "bitcoind show" that shows a nice summary in
your Terminal (Console) with all the data that a node administrator wants
to know.
When I say "grafical interface" I mean like "top" command, an interface
made out of characters in ASCII.
- Split Bitcoin Wallet from Bitcoin Node:
I believe that this is planned, some people want to help the network and
others want to keep a wallet, someones want both.
With bitcoind you can use the option "disablewallet=1" that allows to save
some memory.
- Inform users if 8333 port is closed:
That should be more visible, I dont mean an alert or warning but some icon.
- Keep connections if bitcoind is restarted:
I noticed that if I restart bitcoind (to apply new config) my reset to 0
and take some hours to rise up to ~40. I believe that my peers should
notice that I am down for less than ~15 minutes and try to connect again
