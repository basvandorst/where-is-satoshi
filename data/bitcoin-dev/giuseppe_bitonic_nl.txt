Except that Mozilla/Apple/MSFT will update these certificate stores -
second their policies - and your snapshot/collection might get
outdated at a different pace than the OS-provided certificates,
depending on how you (or the package maintainer) are rolling out updates.
I am not saying that OS-provided certificate stores are a holy grail,
as they comes with their quirks&headaches (for example try to install
your CA certificate on Mac), but generally I consider shipping your
own snapshot a bad practice, as it makes the system less secure by
default for the casual user and harder to audit for the (eventual) admins.
If you are a developer, that's a whole different story.
