Bitcoin could embed a lisp interpreter such as Scheme, reverse engineer
the current protocol into lisp (inside C++), run this alternative engine
alongside the current one as an option for some years (only for fine
tuning) then eventually fade this lisp written validation code instead
of the current one.
Scheme is small and minimal, and embeds easily in C++. This could be a
better option than the libconsensus library - validation in a functional
scripting language.
That doesn't mean people can't program the validation code in other
languages (maybe they'd want to optimize), but this code would be the
It's really good how you are thinking deeply how Bitcoin can be used,
and the implications of everything. Also there's a lot of magical utopic
thinking in Ethereum, which is transhumanist nonsense that is life
denying. Bitcoin really speaks to me because it is real and a great tool
following the UNIX principle.
I wouldn't be so quick to deride good engineering over systematic
provable systems for all domains. Bitcoin being written in C++ is not a
defect. It's actually a strong language for what it does. Especially
when used correctly (which is not often and takes years to master).
With the seals idea- am I understand this correctly?: Every transaction
has a number (essentially the index starting from 0 upwards) depending
on where it is in the blockchain.
Then there is an array (probably an on disk array mapping transaction
indexes to hashes). Each hash entry in the array must be unique (the
hashes) otherwise the transaction will be denied. This is a great idea
to solve transaction hash collisions and simple to implement.
Probabilistic validation is a good idea, although the real difficulty
now seems to be writing and indexing all the blockchain data for
lookups. And validation is disabled for most of the blocks. Pruning is
only a stop gap measure (which loses data) that doesn't solve the issue
of continually growing resource consumption. Hardware and implementation
can only mitigate this so much. If only there was a way to simplify the
underlying protocol to make it more resource efficient...

In England under RIPA 2000 legislation, it's irrelevant whether you have
the data or not. If the authorities compel you to hand over that
information, and it is within your means to obtain it then you are
obliged to do so under threat of criminal offense.
So any mechanism whereby data could be collected from Bitcoin users,
whether it's stored ephemerally or not, if the police have reasonable
suspicion to think it exists then they can compel all parties to work to
get them the data they require.
If the mechanism flat out does not exist, that is miles better than
could exist. Deniability is not a defense when served with a police
notice for disclosing data.
You have to think not only about the end result, but also about how
these mechanisms can be used for intimidating users or leveraging

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Transaction Replacement by Fee 
Where can I find the rules on transaction replacement?
For instance what are the valid ranges for the sequence values in
transaction inputs? Normally I set this value to MAX_UINT32, and the
locktime to 0.
Can I change the outputs? Can I add more inputs to pay a higher fee?
Just looking for clarity on this aspect of Bitcoin. Any resources would
be much appreciated.

Hi, AFAIK snicker is limited to 2 party mixes for the foreseeable future.
What makes this a useful anonymity system for cryptocurrency/Bitcoin?
