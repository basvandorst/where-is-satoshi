@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Stamping transaction 
*stamping transactions* is as simple idea but has huge impact.
Simply, stamping transaction means putting previous block hash in the
header of the transaction. With this simple technique we can *decouple
*translation from
the block.
I have described my idea here:
I know bitcoin developers tends to not change the core, but you can
consider it for next big change.

Good day ZmnSCPxj
Thank you so much for your time to read my proposal.
About your comments, I do agree with some of them but maybe we need to
discuss more about them.
You might agree that any changes (especially a fundamental change like
stamping transactions) comes with advantages and probably some
disadvantages. I believe the advantages of stamping transactions are worth
having it.
*The main point of stamping transactions is decoupling transactions from
the block. *
*Blockchain size matters*
SegWit is a good witness that shows blockchain size matters. Nowadays, Data
storage is cheap and easy, but that doesn't mean it's a simple matter. If
you need to have a data-center to keep a copy of a blockchain, then you are
far from a decentralization system.
*A Solution*
Stamping transaction is a simple idea to keep the size of the blockchain as
small as possible. The question that I was looking to answer is how we can
decouple the transaction from the blocks.
Who cares about the transaction that happened 10 years ago. In the real
world you may go to your bank and ask them to give you transaction history.
But they probably have limits. They might say we just only keep the last 3
months in our system.
unspendable `scriptPubKey` with 0 output value.
SoftFork is not possible here. Because the transaction will not be saved
inside the block (only tx hashes). Block format needs to be changed.
Therefore the block will be invalid.
I don't think we need to memorize the last N block hashes.  We can have
something like:
Current_Height - Height_Of(tx.stamp) <= N
I think Stamping transactions have nothing to do with the
incentivization mechanism.  Forgive me if I couldn't get your point.
It's bad of me that I don't really know how mempool works in Bitcoin. My
assumption is that there are some junk transactions (transactions that are
valid but have very low or zero fees) inside the mempool. Stamping
transactions might help to get rid of them time to time.
Best Regards,

As I said before, I don't expect a hard fork for this change. I wanted to
share my thoughts with you guys. Anytime the bitcoin community decides to
make a hard-fork, you might consider this change as well.
I believe decoupling transactions from the block is beautiful.
 About transaction verification,
Transactions have their own way to survive. Owner of the coin can keep the
history of his transactions.
But there is no guarantee that ndes should keep all of them from the
genesis. It depends. Maybe some nodes want to keep  all the transactions,
some part of them and might nothing.
Also we can think about check pointing. When a new node connects to the
network, it doesn't need to validate all the blocks since genesis. It can
start validating from a checkpoint.
And also adding 32 bits to the header of translation (which won't be saved
inside the block) is not a big deal.
