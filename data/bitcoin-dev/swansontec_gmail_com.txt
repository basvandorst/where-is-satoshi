@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Serialised P2SH HD chains 
Yes. A few of us over here in San Diego actually started working on a
format like this a few months ago, but it's been on the back burner
for a while.
Our motivation was to come up with a shared HD wallet format. Say I
would like create a 2-of-3 multisig wallet using my phone, PC, and
hardware key fob. All three devices would presumably be running
different wallet software, so we need some sort of standardized HD
multisig chain-description format that all three wallets can
understand. That way, regardless of their other differences, the
wallets can at least agree on how to generate new addresses.
Of course, once you share this chain-description file with a third
party, they too can generate addresses out of the wallet. This can be
used for auditing (like for charities), for receive-only wallets (like
a merchant kiosk), and for recurring payments. The recurring payment
case is a little problematic, since you need to trust the payee with
your privacy. I imagine this would only be useful for payouts you
manage yourself, like a mining pool, and not something you share with
the general public.
Our format is very similar to yours. We have a script template, just
like you do, but we describe the HD chains in a separate section
rather than in-line with the script. The script template only comes
into being once the chains have been gathered together into one place,
so the chain descriptions need to stand alone.
Unfortunately, we still have a lot of details to work through before
we have a concrete proposal that's ready for this mailing list.
Perhaps we can work together to come up with something.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] bip-0021 and bip-0072 ambiguities & mistakes 
I am attempting to write a parser for bip-0021 URI's, including
support for the new bip-0072 payment parameters. My goal is absolute
correctness. Unfortunately, these BIP's have a few ambiguities and
mistakes which ought to be corrected.
First, I would like to point out that internet RFC 3986 governs the
general syntax for URI's. It obsoletes RFC 1738 and various other
early RFC's. Since RFC 3986 came out in 2005, I think we can agree
that any bitcoin URI scheme should use this and not the earlier ones.
Unfortunately, bip-0021 never actually mentions RFC 3986, which is a
big omission. Even worse, bip-0072 explicitly refers to RFC 1738,
which is obsolete. This is a problem, since the old, obsolete standard
requires more escapes than are actually necessary. Updating bip-0072
to refer to RFC 3986 instead would allow shorter, more readable
bitcoin URI's (things like slashes in payment addresses wouldn't need
to be escaped).
Secondly, neither of the bip's describe what to do with international
characters. I doubt anybody wants to limit the "label" and "message"
parameters to 7-bit ASCII, so a character encoding needs to be
defined. RFC reccomends that all new URI schemes use UTF-8 as their
encoding, which is perfectly reasonable. The bip-0021 standard just
needs to actually say so.
Finally, there is an error in the bip-0021 BNF grammar, which never
mentions the '&' separator between query elements.
What is the procedure for getting these BIP's corrected? Submit a pull
request with the changes? Hopefully we can all agree that these fixes
are useful and necessary.
P.S. The bitcoin-qt client uses QUrl to parse bitcoin uri's, and that
is based on RFC 3986. Thus, the bitcoin-qt client is probably already
implementing these suggestions.

All right, I have submitted the pull request. Hopefully, the specified
behavior now corresponds more closely to what the bitcoin-qt client is
actually doing, and to what the RFC recommends.

It's not really clear why this is better than BIP 44 as it already
stands. You have the same fields, but they are just in a different
order. Couldn't you just use the existing BIP 44 hierarchy, but add
the convention that "wallet/account N" is the same wallet in each
supported currency?
For example, if I have a wallet called "business expenses", which
happens to be wallet m / 44' / 0' / 5', for Bitcoin, then the same
wallet would be m / 44' / 3' / 5' for Dogecoin, and m / 44' / 2' / 5'
for Litecoin.
I am trying to think of examples where your proposal is better than
BIP 44, but I can't think of any. Even backup recovery works fine. I
assume that your idea is to continue iterating over the different
wallet indices as long as you are finding funds in *any* currency.
Well, you can still do that with BIP 44. The fields are in a different
order, but that doesn't affect the algorithm in any way.
Maybe you have some deeper insight I'm not seeing, but if so, you need
to clearly explain that in your motivation section. The current
explanation, "This limits the possible implementations of
multi-currency, multisignature wallets," is pretty vauge. Also, there
is nothing in this spec that addresses the multisignature use-case.
The BIP 45 spec does a lot of extra work to make multisignature work
I'm not trying to criticize your proposal. I'm just trying to
understand what it's trying to accomplish.

Oops, sorry I missed that.
Since that's the reason this proposal exists, I would consider putting
it right up top where people can see it. Also, since this proposal is
specifically designed for multi-sig, I would look at what BIP45 is
doing and maybe incorporate a "cosigner_index" branch. Otherwise, this
idea seems like a reasonable way to organize a wallet.

Suppose Alice and Bob share a multi-sig wallet. Alice would like to
accept payment from Mallory, and Bob would like to accept payment from
Maude. So, they would each like to create a separate payment address.
If Alice and Bob both generate the same address, the incoming funds
would be mixed together (bad), and Mallory and Maude might learn about
the relationship between Alice and Bob (also bad).
Unfortunately, Alice and Bob are in a place where they can't
communicate (maybe Bob has no cell service). There is no way for Bob
to send a message like "I'm making a request on address_index N,
Alice, please use a different index for your request."
The cosigner_index solves this. When they set up the wallet, Alice and
Bob agree to always use a different value for the cosigner_index. That
way, addresses from Alice will never overlap with addresses from Bob,
since they are on different branches. Doing it this way adds privacy
and doesn't cost anything.
With this added in, your path would be:
m / purpose' / wallet' / coin_type / cosigner_index / change / address_index
XPUB's generated from your wallet would then be compatible with XPUB's
generated by other multi-sig wallets like CoPay, since the
(cosigner_index / change / address_index) structure stays the same.

Hello Alan,
Your scheme is basically the same as the BIP45 scheme, except that you
have collapsed the "cosigner_index" and "change" fields into a single
field with the formula:
    combined = 2*cosigner_index + change
This removes one level from the hierarchy, but ultimately produces the
same number and type of chains as BIP45 (just addressed differently).
I kinda like the BIP45's approach of giving each field has its own
dedicated purpose. What is the motivation behind flattening the
I ask because the wallet I work on, Airbitz, will be adding multi-sig
at some point in the future, and we need to figure out what kind of HD
tree structure we will be using. Our ideal structure would basically
be BIP 44 plus some "no-collision" logic:
    m / purpose' / coin_type' / wallet' / cosigner_index / change /
I feel like interoperability with Copay would be worth the extra HD
branch. Assuming Kefkius adds similar no-collision logic, his proposal
is pretty close to our ideal:
    m / purpose' / wallet' / coin_type / cosigner_index / change / address_index
Of course, I am open to hearing your thoughts on this as well.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] 75%/95% threshold for transaction versions 
The BIP 62 approach to malleability isn't the only option. Another
approach is to sign the transaction in such a way that the input
txid's are allowed to change without invalidating the signatures. That
way, if malleability happens, you just adjust you transaction to match
and re-broadcast. That proposal is here:
The "Build your own nHashType" thread on this mailing list contains
the discussion.
I personally prefer this solution, since it nails the problem
completely with one simple and obvious change. The BIP 62 approach is
more like a game of wac-a-mole.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Proposal for P2P Wireless (Bluetooth LE) 
You are right, of course. There is no way to make Bluetooth 100%
secure, since it is an over-the-air technology. You could try securing
it using a CA or other identity server, but now you've excluded ad-hoc
person-to-person payments. Plus, you need an active internet
connection to reach the CA.
You can try using proximity as a substitute for identity, like
requiring NFC to kick-start the connection, but at that point you
might as well use QR codes.
This BIP is not trying to provide absolute bullet-proof security,
since that's impossible given the physical limitations of the
Bluetooth technology. Instead, it's trying to provide the
best-possible security given those constraints. In exchange for this,
we get greatly enhanced usability in common scenarios.
There are plenty of usable, real-world technologies with big security
holes. Anybody with lock-picking experience will tell you this, but
nobody is welding their front door shut. The ability to go in and out
is worth the security risk.
Bluetooth payments add a whole new dimension to real-world Bitcoin
usability. Do we shut that down because it can't be made perfect, or
do we do the best we can and move forward?

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Bip 32 Question 
The `n` is the curve order, as shown here:
This step is necessary to keep you on the curve. The
secp256k1_ec_privkey_tweak_add function from libsecp256k1 handles this
automatically, but if you use OpenSSL or some non-EC math library, you
probably have to do it yourself.
