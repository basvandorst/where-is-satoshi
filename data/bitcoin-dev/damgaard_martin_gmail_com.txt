@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Suggestion for a universal bitcoin value scale 
Hi bitcoin-dev at lists.linuxfoundation.org
Here is my humble attempt to make a contribution to the impressive work that you all are doing. I am unfamiliar with the normal BIP procedures. I have therefore just tried to follow the example of BIP 176 by Jimmy Song, in order make something similar. I suggest a universal bitcoin value color scale, for tackling the same decimal problem, as identified by the BIP 176 proposal.
I have attached the document in three different formats (*.rtf, *.pdf and *.docx) as I do not know your preferred format. I hope you will find my suggestion useful.
Thank you and all the best Martin Damgaard

Hi I have made a GitHub version of the suggestion:
where I have collected the commons made to the first version in a remarks-file. I will try to make a new version incorporation the different commons, and if anyone would like to help they will be more than welcome to join.
All kind of suggestions are more than welcome, and thank you for the good points made so far. All the best Fra: Ad?n S?nchez de Pedro Crespo

It would be great if you could submit this as a markdown document published somewhere with version control, such as GitHub. That'd make life easier for anyone willing to contribute to your proposal.

A very good point. I have realized the immature nature of my suggestion due to this and a number of other good remarks, and will like to retract the initial suggestion.  Thank you and all the best Martin Damgaard

A potential problem is that it would be a new attack vector to simply
color something to appear as e.g. 10x more than it really is, if
everyone started using this system.
