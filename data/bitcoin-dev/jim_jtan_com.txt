@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Base-32 error correction coding 
Can we do better than correcting single transcription errors?  I'd
imagine that transposition of two adjacent characters, or insertion or
deletion of a single character, would be very common.  At the very
least, a transposition could be corrected by interleaving the two
"halves of the coded representation", e.g.:
   ABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABAB
insead of
   AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB
