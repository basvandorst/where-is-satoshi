I totally agree on the kitchen sink concern; I would personally like to see
something like a one-year required discussion period on all non-security
changes proposed to the blockchain protocol. We know almost nothing about
how bitcoin will be used over the next 20 years; I believe it's a mistake
to bulk up the protocol too rapidly right now.
There's a famous phrase from the founder of Lotus about Lotus' engineering
process: "add lightness." The equivalent for protocol design might be "add
simplicity." I'd like to see us adding simplicity for now, getting a core
set of tests together for alternate implementations like libbitcoin, and
thinking hard about the dangers of cruft over a 10+ year period when it
comes to a technology which will necessarily include a complete history of
every crufty decision embodied in transaction histories.

I agree that it would be nice if the protocol stayed stateless.
I also think we should try and keep in our heads the aggregate
bitcoin-universe cost of implementing any protocol change; even a very
small change, something that truly only takes one hour of time from each
bitcoin node client developer to implement, test and bugfix (hah!) Has a
cost in the (tens?) of thousands of USD added up across those who need to

These are interesting thoughts, karma for bitcoins essentially.
I would like CoinLab to publish a 'cost of subverting 1-n transactions with
90% probability' metric soon, and I think it would help everyone to
understand what that number is.
When we started out, you probably needed to wait 5 blocks for $10 or $20 of
bitcoin value transfer.
Now, I'd happily accept a $1k transaction with 1 confirmation.
More difficulty shortens the safe time we can transact large volumes in,
which is good for the network.
I'm not sure of the current implementation of replacement transactions, can
anyone on the core team speak to this? Can I replace transactions, or is
that part of the spec unimplemented or deprecated right now?

I do think SOPA and PIPA could impact bitcoin, what if, for instance,
copyrighted material made its way into the blockchain?
Already the DMCA would make it hard for someone publishing blocks online to
do anything but cease under a DMCA request. SOPA, at least, would go
farther and allow the US to cut all access to 'offending' sites elsewhere
in the world.
At any rate, I don't think these bills are 'aimed at' BitCoin, and the

The proposal is simple, and it's a small change for miners, I imagine.
My question is: why?
I worry about stuffing too many requirements on the coinbase. I suppose the
coinbase is easily extendible if we run out of bytes, but I think I'd like
to see some more discussion / good / bad type cases for making this change.
What do we get over just the prev_hash by doing this?
If this is just a voting mechanism for moving to v2 blocks, that's cool,
but it would be nice to codify voting in the coinbase a bit? Maybe? We've
now once voted with /p2sh/ and this is a different mechanism now, if I
understand it properly.
Anyway, some background would be great; if I missed it, I'm happy to go

I'm unclear on the economics of this attack; we spent a bit of time talking
about it a few months ago at CoinLab and decided not to worry about it for

Does it have asymmetric payoff for an attacker, that is, over time does it
pay them more to spend their hashes attacking than just mining?
My gut is that it pays less well than mining, meaning I think this is
likely a small problem in the aggregate, and certainly not something we
should try and fork the blockchain for until there's real pain.
Consider, for instance, whether it pays better than just mining bitcoins
and spending those on 'bonuses' for getting users to switch from a pool you
Watson, I don't believe the attack signature you mention is a factor here,
since the pool controls the merkle, only that pool will benefit from block
submission. The nonce / coinbase combo is worthless otherwise, and so this
attack is just in brief "get lucky, but don't submit."
So, can anyone enlighten me as to some actual estimates of badness for this

As it is right now, we've split our codebase a bit; we rely on the client

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] BIP 33 - Stratized Nodes 
Thanks for this, Amir.
My initial reactions:
1) This is cool and useful (but see 3)
2) This is significantly less secure than validating an entire blockchain;
it's certainly worth working out some use cases here in more detail than
just a sample conversation. More on this below
3) What about discovery? Will a client now have the chance to look for
NODE_STRATIZED clients on IRC? How do you envision a stratized server
decides which transactions to relay/store? Or is it just a caching layer in
front of a high quality blockchain service? If it is just a caching
service, the question of cache hits / misses is an interesting one as well.
4) What are the economic motivations to run a stratized server? Other than
cheating people of course.
5) Seems like a 'send me everything for this source address' is going to
save a lot of roundtrip conversations for what I imagine the most common
request will be.
Inre: majority agreement on transactions, and even balances, it would be
nice to work out some theoretical security / cost / value calculations for
the following scenarios:
Likely value and cost to someone of subverting / lying about
1) An n-confirmation transaction, n > 0
2) A 0 confirmation transaction
3) A NODE_STRATIZED transaction chain for a client with m connections to
NODE_STRATIZED servers
4) An address balance request for a client with m connections to
NODE_BALANCE_INFO (I made this name up) servers

We just implemented our own mining tool, soup-to-nuts, and I would say that
the likely motivation for what I presume are botnet owners is just economic.
It's a lot more work to make sure your merkleing and keeping up-to-date are
happening than it is to just get an 80 byte header from a central server,
and re-calc a single transaction merkle client-side.
Not to mention the extra work to keep track of what version of
getmemorypool output you're receiving work for in a broadly distributed
For what it's worth, we did this extra engineering work since we care about
Bitcoin, but if I just wanted to pull value out of the ecosystem, we would
have skipped it.
The only solutions to this are economic solutions -- making such 'cheater'
blocks less valuable, or increasing the value of the transactions.
Also note that botnet operators likely care, in the end, about fiat
currency, so going to 25 btc per block in what I think of as transaction
fee subsidies won't necessarily impact this -- it's a matter of what
happens to exchange rates vs generation rates that will matter.
I think we also have to moderate this consideration against the rights (and
arguable benefits) of someone wanting to build an express-delivery mining
service, one that will provide provably faster certification for those
adding a transaction fee of, say, 1 btc.
My own experience now in the MMO world is that we have to carefully
understand how we deal with griefers who control massive resources (compute
or gold-farmers). It may not be a winning battle to choose a solution which
harms the rest of the network in exchange for harming the griefers.
This is definitely out of the box, but one solution might be to change the
difficulty calculations to just ignore 1tx blocks; that would minimize
impact on others to a great extent, and would let someone set up an express
block service if they chose. I guess we'd have to settle on whether or not
such blocks counted towards the issuance countdown as well. Or, we could
allow only 1/10 generation fees on such blocks.

One of the issues here though is that it would be nice if miners published
their own tx rules -- it might be hard to impute them from data.
I had started a thread about this on bitcoin.org some time ago, and I don't
recall what the general outcome was.
I had imagined an open service whereby a miner could publish a short string
in their conbase tying to the service and the service would have different
metadata, including the miner's transaction guarantees.
We offered to host this before, and would still be willing to host such a

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Punishing empty blocks? 
OK, I have a few thoughts on this:
1) Germane to the original conversation, anything hard to implement will
not get implemented by miners.
2) Coinbase is hard-limited to 100 bytes; this has to include space for
voting as well as extra nonce, etc. So, I'm not sure that a full URL is a
good plan.
3) I'm a little fuzzy on the details of BIP governance; but I'm happy to
write one up and get my thoughts down, or someone who's more familiar could
do it, I suppose.
I propose the following spec:
periodically a miner may choose to publish a url through their coinbase as
1) They shall prepend \mi: to the url to designate it as a url for miner
info, and append a trailing \ to the url
2) The url given in the coinbase shall have http:// prepended to it before
3) The destination may be a redirect (to allow short URLs), or may deliver
4) The content-type returned by the final site post-redirect shall be
either (preferred text/json) or text/plain or text/html
4) The text of the document delivered shall be a JSON format dictionary,
and shall include at minimum the following fields: 'min_fee', 'pool_name',
and 'last_modified' Optional fields can be determined over time as
necessary by the mining community
5) The Service Level Agreement isn't binding, but miners who implement it
are expected to make a best efforts attempt to follow it.
So a valid coinbase could be:
Generally a miner would occasionally publish the \mi:\ when they had
updated their SLA, or just every so often, but the canonical location would
be the final destination URL from the redirects.
Inre: Luke's complaint about JSON, it is the language of the web. There is
no easier format for both computers and humans to read, and in this case,
it includes extensibility, which is nice, since we have no idea how miners
will wish to divvy up their services; I think one would need to make a
strong case against JSON for a specific reason to not choose it by default.
Thoughts welcome!

I see. That is undeniably more secure and "bitcoin-y" than my suggestion.
It's also really a lot more work, especially in that it requires extra
linkages between codebases that in my mind are largely separate.
I'm just one voice, but I persist in believing that the 'lighter' solution,
especially for something that may not be a particularly big problem in the
bitcoin world is good -- it carries much less technical implementation debt
going forward, and has a lower risk of sort of seizing up development with
additional necessary code to worry about for those implementing to-spec
If that lighter solution turns out to be gameable, or has problems that
require the full force of the bitcoin network and concepts, that would be
the time to implement the improved version. That's just my approach,
however. I worry that building in any additional requirements to the
protocol or codebase adds significant cost to the network as a whole over
the next 10 years.

I disagree with a bunch of your points, but I'll wait on others to comment,

you elucidate?
I am assuming major mining folks have written their own coinbasing
facilities, but perhaps this is not the case -- if so, I agree that some
work is necessary for such miners.
Finally I will just comment that I am guided by the general perspective
that many things about bitcoins are opt-in; therefore it makes sense to me
put difficult work onto those who are motivated to do it, and keep things
as easy as possible for the 'maybes' to participate -- hence small
courtesies like allowing text/plain or text/html.

which would benefit from out of band messages and notes.
This is small, but an interesting tidbit from BTC Foundation payments;
roughly 3-5% of our initial members double-spent. WOW, that's terrible.
I presume that's because they use web wallets without double-click
prevention. But, seriously! A tiny UI issue that's a big deal in an
irrevocable payment system.
I'm trying but can't think of a lightweight solution to this off the top of
my head. Not that that proves much.

comes into clarity for me just how innovative and incredibly awesome this
would be for financial controls for companies. Imagine the bookkeeper
inputting payments, and the owner (or 2 of 3 owners) approving them. I can
even imagine large member groups having 2/3 or majority spend rules.

We've been toying with the idea of a 'dead' button, one that issues a bunch
of pre-generated txs sending stuff out to a previously secured 'backup' set
of addresses (we don't think in terms of wallets, just keypairs).
In this scenario, you have a long-term storage address (or set of them),
and if you need to hit the panic button, previously signed transactions
send value over to your emergency storage.
If you've mucked around sending / receiving with your long-term storage,
you'd only catch some BTC, not necessarily all, but what's nice is the
panic transaction leaking has lower security requirements than your private
keys -- worst case it's out, and you've got to deal with stuff in emergency
storage, as opposed to losing all your coins.
You could pair this with a server that checks if 'safe' addresses have
'unauthorized' transactions showing up on the blockchain, and you'd have a
reasonable automated security layer. Maybe. :)
I'm interested in thoughts on this approach as well.

So, this

I will hold my thoughts about the net social good of rent-seeking large
corporations taking money from consumers over fraudulent reversals.
Actually, I won't, I just said it.
At any rate, it got me thinking, can we layer on revocability somehow
without any protocol change, as an opt-in?
My initial scheme is a trusted (hah) escrow service that issues time
promises for signing. If it doesn't receive a cancel message, it will sign
at the end of the time.
The addresses would be listed by the escrow service, or in an open
registry, so you could see if you were going to have a delay period when
you saw a transaction go out.
This seems sort of poor to me, it imagines that mythical thing, a trusted
escrow service, and is vulnerable to griefing, but I thought I'd see if
some of the brighter minds than me can come up with a layer-on approach
When I think about it, I can imagine that I would put a good number of my
coins in a one day reversible system, because I would have warning if
someone wanted to try and spend them, and could do something about it. I'm
not sure if it gets me anything over a standard escrow arrangement, though.

I think this is a very interesting idea. As Bitcoiners, we often stuff

works better as a curing period, essentially an extended version of the
current 100 block wait for mined coins.
An alternate setup comes to mind; I can imagine this working as a sort of
gift economy; people pay real BTC for merge-mined "beta BTC" as a way to
support development. There is no doubt a more elegant and practical
solution that might have different economic and crypto characteristics.
