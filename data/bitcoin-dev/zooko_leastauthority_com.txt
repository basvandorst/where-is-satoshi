> 1) Rule changes.  We don't want these.
In general? What constitutes a rule change?
For example, if I understand correctly (from what Gavin said at
Bitcoin 2013), there is a move afoot to lift the block size limit.
Although, when I went to confirm my understanding by reading the
bitcoin-development list archives, I don't see mention of this. Is
there another forum I should be reading if I want to follow Bitcoin
Anyway, I hope that there are some rule changes that you would
consider for Bitcoin, although I recognize there are vast classes of
such changes that you wouldn't.
I'm trying to figure out what's the most productive way to show you,
and everyone, candidates for such changes. Things that are definitely
not suitable for merging to trunk tomorrow, but might be suitable in a
year or two, or "Next Time We Have A Hardfork".
I don't think alternative bitcoin-clones are the best venue for those.
Although they are certainly good venues for changes which can never
make it into Bitcoin.
Perhaps the best venue for such a thing is just to fork bitcoin.git on github.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] [softfork proposal] Strict DER signatures 
.Hi there. Thank you for your work on this.
I've looked over  and
 . I didn't
actually audit the included reference implementation of
IsValidSignatureEncoding(), and I didn't check whether the test
vectors in exercise all of the branches that are changed by this patch.
I have the following comments:
* It seems like a good idea to do this.
* I don't see any problem with using the upgrade mechanism from BIP 34
for this. It's cool! I'm happy that such a mechanism seems to work in
* Should the bipstrictder give a rationale or link to why accept the
0-length sig as correctly-encoded-but-invalid? I guess the rationale
is an efficiency issue as described in the log entry for
* Does this mean there are still multiple ways to encode a correctly
encoded but invalid signature, one of which is the 0-length string?
Would it make sense for this change to also treat any *other*
correctly-encoded-but-invalid sig (besides the 0-length string) as
incorrectly-encoded? Did I just step in some BIP62?
* It would be good to verify that all the branches of the new
IsDERSignature() from
are tested by the test vectors in
. Eyeballing it, there are about 20 branches touched by the patch, and
about 24 new test vectors.
* It would be good to finish the TODOs in
so that it was actually testing the upgrade behavior.
* missing comment:
Okay, that's all I've got. Hope it helps! Thanks again for your good work!

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Relative CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY (was CLTV 
I'm in favor of relative CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY, but I don't have a very
specific reason. I just have a vague worry that there can be "race
conditions" in which a txn with an absolute CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY goes
into the blockchain later than one of its signers expected that it
would, and therefore there is a surprisingly short delay between that
transaction going into the blockchain and becoming spendable.
This worry of mine is assuaged by using relative CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY instead.
