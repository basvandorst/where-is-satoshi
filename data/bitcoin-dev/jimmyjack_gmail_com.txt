Thank you Simon for sharing your tests, if possible can you share TX hashes please. I would recommend to send them money post-mortem. What you did is really valuable information, however it can be classified as fraud. I really don?t want open this topic here, just suggesting to keep your record clean :-) Can you please share the TX Hash
Peter, I noticed on your twitter you have a lot of bad things to say about Blockcypher and their business model (which I might not full agree, but totally respect), can you share any evidence they perform any form of Sybil attack on the network, please.

Have you talk to them? If not, how can you be sure they don?t run large number of standard nodes and actually make the network stronger? Personally I never bring claims like this if I just assume. A lot of people in the community really trust you, do you realize you potentially hurt them for no reason?
btw I do not work for them nor have any money invested in them in case anybody asks

I guess we sort of disagree here, perhaps my word ?strength? was not the right word. Yes, running 6000 vs 7000 nodes makes no difference for the network strength, but (a) running 50 nodes vs 5000 does make a difference. I would love to see how the number of nodes drop if companies like blockcypher turn off their servers. Obviously it would not go 50. (b) running different clients (if blockcypher runs non-reference-bitcoinD client) makes the network less open wide-spread bugs
I feel we are really derailing the original topic btw  :-)

my guess, he is talking about this   - slam dunk technique for doublespend
I find this useful

Is this unrelated to Bitcoin Vigil idea published in 2014?
