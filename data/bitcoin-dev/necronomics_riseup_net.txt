@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Block Size Increase Requirements 
I saw this. I was also pointing this out to the people who were asking me. A
commit to a personal repository does not at first seem more than
experimental. sipa commits weird/neat things to private branches all the
time, after all.
About the only argument IMO in favour of block size increases is to that making more room in a block will make it attractive to use for more
people at some point in the future: increasing transaction velocity,
increasing economy size, increasing value overall.
Who else but miners and pool operators will run full nodes when full are being shut down because they are too large and unwieldy to maintain? is already so that casual users refuse to run full nodes. This fact is
indisputable. The only question remaining is, "Do we care?" Arguments
against users who feel that the dataset is too large to run a full node,
full-time, start from a premise that these users are a static and fraction. Is this even true? "Do we care?" I do. I will shortly only be to run half the nodes I currently do thanks to the growth of the at its current rate.
I would refuse to mine under such a regulated regime; moreover, I would
enjoy forking away from this, and, I suspect, the only miners who remain
would be those whose ultimate motivations do not coincide with the That is, the set of miners who are users, and the set of users who are
miners, would be wholly non-intersecting.
This is unfortunate but true.
The explicit form of the block dictated by the reference client and
agreed-to by the people who were sold on bitcoin near the beginning included) was explicitly the notion that the rules were static; that the
nature of transaction foundations and the subsidies would not be Here we have a hardfork being contemplated which is not only but does not even address some of the highest-utility and most-requested
features in peoples' hardfork wishlists.
The fact that mining has effectively been centralized directly implies destabilizing changes that some well-heeled (and thus theoretically at least) people have explicitly begun plans to fork the blockchain will have an unknown, and completely unforeseen combined effect.
We can pretend that, "If merchants and miners and exchanges go along, who else matters," but the reality is that the value in bitcoin exists
because *people* use it for real transactions: Not miners, whose profits parasitically fractionally based on the quality and strength of the economy as a whole; not exchanges who lubricate transactions in service the economy; not even today's merchants whose primary means of accepting
bitcoin seems to be to convert them instantly to fiat and not meaningfully in the economy at all; not enriched felons; but actual There are two ways to look at it, assuming that the blocksize change
increases bitcoin's value to people after all: mining centralization will be
corrected; or, mining centralization will not be corrected.
I would argue that rapidly increasing profitability at this point will
exacerbate the mining centralization problem, and in much the same way when people were throwing money and unknowingly funding the massive of the current cabals when bitcoin's exchange-driven rise to $1200 was Thus, even if the premise were true, what will a blocksize increase given mining centralization itself is a bigger systemic risk?
The recent "revelation" that there are masses of paid trolls on popular
forum sites like reddit who supposedly don't even know who is hiring and the anger of more vociferous commenters in general, does not the relevance of every non-"industry" voice.  I think elevating the
discussion away from the users does the system and the development as a whole quite an injustice.
I have seen most of these; or the ideas seem obvious based on their It is not okay. If the current mining cabals continue to exist, and
flourish, and the developers make major changes that ignore this glaring
elephant, then the decentralized promise of bitcoin will be put more at
