We would only end up with few copies of the historic data if users
could choose what parts of the blockchain to store. Simply store
chunks randomly, according to users available space, and give priority
to the "N most recent" chunks to have more replicas in the network.
You don't need bittorrent specifically for a DHT, if publicity is a
problem. There are many DHT proposals and implementations, and i bet
one of them should be more suitable to the bitcoin network than

Of course.
My proposal was just for the pruned nodes.
I.e. You would have a majority (maybe not even a majority required) of
nodes storing the whole blockchain and pruned nodes would store
"random" parts of the blockchain, according to the resources they
have, which would be organized as a DHT.

Or have blocks distributed through pruned nodes as a DHT.

I am of the same opinion, although i understand Gavin's point. Would
the multisig seed work for this purpose?
I have been toying with this idea and I think that for this BIP to
make sense it would require a "root" key as your login. Then if you
need to make transfers the system would request you to create and
associate a new key to your account for each purchase (signing the new
key with the root one for example).

anyway, any kind of compression that comes to the blockchain is
orthogonal to pruning.
I agree that you will probably want some kind of replication on more
recent nodes than on older ones. However, nodes with older blocks
don't need to be "static", get the block distribution algorithm to
sort it out.

2014-03-25 13:49 GMT+00:00 Peter Todd :
This argument is quite the fallacy. The only reason we have that few
pools is because each of their miners doesn't find it feasible to mine
"on their own". if you count the individual miners on those pools you
will get to the scale Gavin was trying to point out.
Nevertheless i think that is just a minor disagreement, since tree
chains help decentralization.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Forget dormant UTXOs without confiscating bitcoin 
I really like ideas that tackle this issue. The question imho is what is
the incentive to run a "Full UTXO node" instead of a pruned or archive node.
For starters, it would be nice to know what would be the savings for Full
UTXO nodes over archive nodes right now.
Also, what advantages would this have over "archive pruned nodes: nodes
that store X blocks of the whole blockchain before 420000". Seems like an
interesting intermediate use case to me too.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Proposed alternatives to the 20MB step 
I've been following the discussion of the block size limit and IMO it
is clear that any constant block size limit is, as many have said
before, just kicking the can down the road.
My problem with the dynamic lower limit solution based on past blocks
is that it doesn't account for usage spikes. I would like to propose
another dynamic lower limit scheme:
Let the block size limit be a function of the number of current
transactions in the mempool. This way, bitcoin usage regulates the
block size limit.
I'm sorry i don't have the knowledge of the code base or time to make
simulations on this kind of approach, but nevertheless I would like to
leave it here for discussion or foster other ideas.

Then demonstrate it. He has been raising quite valid points over the
maintenance of bitcoin core.
This is the same problem as the changes to consensus rules in bitcoin
core: they aren't explicitly defined for the external audience. Thus
forcing people to lobby for hard forks.

even though what you say is true, we should aim for wallets not to
require those instructions, by standardizing these things in BIPs.
let's hope bitcoin doesn't fail in standards as our industries have in
the past...

He also said that the equation for miners has many variables, as it
should. There is no disadvantage if the network speed is the same
between the miners. If there is a difference in network speed, the
miner is incentivized to invest in their network infrastructure.

no, let me rephrase: The disadvantage alex refers to only exists if

Just like easy ASIC access, low price electricity, etc are not a free

I would suggest to compile that list for your stage 3, so that you can have
an hardfork that fixes most of those things, and there should be some
repository with those changes deployed.

You can do it on 2nd layer solutions such as the lightning network,
with their own format.
On the base layer you cannot do it without a hard fork, or it would
undermine the invariants of bitcoin.
