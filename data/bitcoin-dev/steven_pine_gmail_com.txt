Block size scaling should be as transparent and simple as possible, like
pegging it to total transactions per difficulty change.

I would support a dynamic block size increase as outlined. I have a few
questions though.
Is scaling by average block size the best and easiest method, why not scale
by transactions confirmed instead? Anyone can write and relay a
transaction, and those are what we want to scale for, why not measure it
I would prefer changes every 2016 blocks, it is a well known change and a
reasonable time period for planning on changes. Two weeks is plenty fast,
especially at a 50% rate increase, in a few months the block size could be
dramatically larger.
Daily change to size seems confusing especially considering that max block
size will be dipping up and down. Also if something breaks trying to fix it
in a day seems problematic. The hard fork database size difference error
comes to mind. Finally daily 50% increases could quickly crowd out smaller
nodes if changes happen too quickly to adapt for.

My understanding, which is very likely wrong in one way or another, is
transaction size and block size are two slightly different things but
perhaps it's so negligible that block size is a fine stand-in for total
transaction throughput.
Potentially Doubling the block size everyday is frankly imprudent. The
logarithmic increases in difficulty, which were often closer to 10% or 20%
every 2016 blocks was and is plenty fast, potentially changing blocksize by
twice daily is the mentality I would expect from a startup with the move
fast break things motto.
Infrastructure takes time, not everyone wants to run a node on a virtual
amazon instance, provisioning additional hard drive and bandwidth can't
happen overnight and trying to plan when block size from one week to the
next is a total mystery would be extremely difficult.
Anyone who has spent time examining the mining difficulty increases and
trajectory knows future planning is very very hard, allowing block size to
double daily would make it impossible.
Perhaps a middle way would be 300%  increase every 2016 blocks, that will
scale to 20mbs within a  month or two
The problem is logarithmic increases seem slow until they seem fast. If the
network begins to grow and block size hits 20, then the next day 40, 80...
Small nodes could get swamped within a week or less.
As for your point about Christmas, Bitcoin is a global network, Christmas,
while widely celebrated, isn't the only holiday, and planning around
American buying habits seems short sighted and no different from developers
trying to choose what the right fee pressure is.
questions though.

there are fee-paying transactions around to pay them. What scenario are you
imagining where transaction volume increases by 50% a day for a sustained
period of time?

It's pretty clear Mike has turned into  concern troll and bully. He insults
people, mischaracterizes others, quibbles over words and definitions and
has stated numerous times in other forums he has no interest in building
consensus changes he doesn't agree with himself.
He's lost his integrity and trust and why the core developers waste their
time with his antics is beyond me, let Mike fork Bitcoin, develop XT, and
ignore his input on core unless some XT feature is deemed good enough to
incorporate, that is how a thousand other open source projects deal with
trolls like Mike.

It's amazing how foolish some people are to continue trusting governments
especially in light of recent history: a seemingly endless, Orwellian 'war
on terror', multiple regional conflicts often justified by fake evidence,
wholesale disregard of law and basic human covenants such as do not
torture, ubiquitous and secret global surveillance.
Anyone who doesn't consider governments the proper threat model is either a
shill or an idiot.

That's a simple fallacy, historically governments even hegemons, fail, in
fact it would be odd to assert that a government will not fail, therefore
ascribing godlike and limitless powers to a government is again the view of
either a shill or someone untutored in history.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP proposal: Increase block size limit to 2 
Is it me or did Gavin ignore Yifu's direct questions? In case you missed it
Gavin --
"We can look at the adoption of the last major Bitcoin core release to
guess how long it might take people to upgrade. 0.11.0 was released on 12
July, 2015. Twenty eight days later, about 38% of full nodes were running
that release. Three months later, about 50% of the network was running that
release, and six months later about 66% of the network was running some
flavor of 0.11."
On what grounds do you think it is reasonable to assume that this update
will roll out 6x faster than previous data suggested, as oppose to your own
observation of 66% adoption in 6 month. or do you believe 38% node
upgrade-coverage (in 28 days ) on the network for a hard fork is good
There are no harm in choosing a longer grace period but picking one short
as 28 days you risk on alienating the nodes who do not upgrade with the
aggressive upgrade timeline you proposed.
When Gavin writes "Responding to "28 days is not long enough" :
I keep seeing this claim made with no evidence to back it up.  As I said, I
surveyed several of the biggest infrastructure providers and the btcd lead
developer and they all agree "28 days is plenty of time."
For individuals... why would it take somebody longer than 28 days to either
download and restart their bitcoind, or to patch and then re-run (the patch
can be a one-line change MAX_BLOCK_SIZE from 1000000 to 2000000)?"
Isn't Yifu's comment, evidence, the very best sort of evidence, it isn't
propositional a priori logic, but empirical evidence that. As for why
people take longer, who knows, we simply know from passed experience that
it in fact does take longer.
It's extremely frustrating to read Gavin's comments, it's hard to believe
he is engaging in earnest discussion.

I agree that it seems like a safe assumption that adoption would be faster,
whether it is "very safe" and "significantly faster", whether it will be 6
times faster, all of those assumptions seems significantly less safe and
robust to me.
The nature of the bitcoin protocol, that it is a decentralized census based
protocol involving currency, suggests to me that roll out schedules ought
to be conservative with a minimum of assumptions. In light of the most
recent protocol upgrade, 6 months for this hard fork seems to me to be the
most conservative time frame with the fewest assumptions.
As for why it needs to be so fast, ie what are the dangers of it being as
slow as 6 months?
"I strongly disagree with the statement that there is no cost to a longer
grace period. There is broad agreement that a capacity increase is needed
"Broad agreement", that really seems to be another assumption, the fact
that the debate has been as long and acrimonious as it has been suggests
that there isn't broad agreement. Also, resorting to "SHOUTING" doesn't win
any favors when it comes to engaging in reasonable discussion om the
technical merits of a proposal.

and we should respect it by knowing that it's good enough to wait for,
and for however its activated to be done the best way we know how.
Regarding this last point I was under the impression that if Segwit did not
activate by November then core was going to move on, is that no longer the
case, does the core team plan on trying to activate Segwit in some other
I am also curious, but has there been a softfork, hardfork, or other major
census change that was not rolled out and done by the core team? I only
mention this because BIP148, if it goes ahead (and is successful), would be
the first time a consensus change occurs outside of the core developers --
but again I am not an expert on the history of changes and could be wrong,
I only bring this up because core developers have in the past stressed they
are a part of the bitcoin ecosystem and not the drivers of it (at least
that is the ideal it seems).
My impression is that the community is ready for this and wants it, and if
that impression is correct it will go ahead. No one knows the future, and
simply assuming it's better to be slow and methodical isn't especially
convincing. Technology is in someways the history of failure, we like to
celebrate the seemingly sudden breakthroughs and successes but it's rare
that the original innovator retains a monopoly on their invention, more
often it becomes quickly refined and iterated upon as market forces take
hold to bring costs down and other external political issues
take precedence, all this is say that in ten years everyone could be
chuckling over the 3 year bitcoin scaling debate, or they could be using
litecoin, or ethereum or some other crypto coin, or something entirely
different, no one knows.

I don't want to be rude and I will refer to your expertise, but segwit does
have a 'time out' as defined in BIP 9 with the date of November 15th? Does
core plan on just releasing another BIP with a new timeout hoping it will
eventually get 95% census?
As for the other point, we can play semantics but that's boring, I guess my
meaning was every census change has gone through a core defined process
(not counting the changes that occurred before there were BIPs and such),
isn't that the case? If the currently discussed UASF goes through it would
seem like the first time census occurred outside core's mailing list of
pull requests, acks, and merge to master, I only note it as a thing of
To be clear, the fast and reckless part for you is the mechanism by which
segwit could possibly be made active? Do you envision a means of segwit
being made consensus that does not have 95% mining support?
I appreciate your time and expertise, and to not take up anymore, back to
lurking i go.

I'm glad some discussion has been moved back here.
Correct me if I am wrong, but currently core developers are arguing over
whether or not to allow an optional configuration switch which defaults off
but signals and enforces BIP148 when used. Who are we protecting users
from, themselves? Are you protecting core? from what? I am somewhat
genuinely befuddled by those who can't even allow a user config switch to
be set.
I guess I find it all incredibly silly, but perhaps I suffer from some
basic confusion.
