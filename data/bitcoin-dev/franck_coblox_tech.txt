Hi Mike,
Any reason why you decided to consider the higher value the "fittest" one
instead of keeping in line with the difficulty algorithm where smallest
values, prefixed with more zeroes, are considered more valuable/difficult?
Also, can you elaborate if anything special would happen if the competitive
chains were created around a difficulty adjustment?
Cheers, Franck
