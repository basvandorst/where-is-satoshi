@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Is Bitcoin mempool synchronized? 
============================== START ==============================
Hi there,
I have been assuming Bitcoin system to be well synchronized, including mempools. But after being challenged, I started to think that I actually cannot verify this without knocking the door of every miner in every single second (just a time slice reasonable to me; stop torturing me by asking why). Can anyone share any thoughts with me?
Thank you,
