I like the intend of this attempt to bring more clarity to the blocksize
debate, however it would be more help to make this a information site about
the current outstanding BIPs and summarize their differences rather than
voting mechanism.
 (ofcourse the author of the BIPs would "vote" for their own proposals.)
It would be good to include supporting and counter statements regards to
these BIPs on the site.
in addition to highlight certain things like pools in china have voiced
their opinion that increase should happen, and 8mb is something they are
comfortable with, which is not directly related to a single BIP, but never
the less relevant in this discussion.

accordingly to public release[1], They.
1. agreed that blocksize increase is needed.
2. opposed original 20mb, suggest 8mb instead as it is more technically
3. do not want blocksize to change in the "short term future" ( direct
translation. ) and in the document states.
"after discussion we are in agreement that the blocksize should be within
the ball park of 8mb for the short term future."
They have no explicitly rejected or supported the other components of
BIP101. It's my opinion that as long as the change is < 8mb. they'll take
I don't believe in trying to predict the future, on adoption, technology
growth, nor geopolitics. I think it matters very little which BIP we need
up deploying, as long as all the attack vectors are covered, especially for
the dynamically adjustable ones.
One thing is for sure though, not increasing the blocksize is not an option.
we can't predict the future, in the mean time, Hardfork Responsibly?.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIPS proposal for implementing AML-KYC in bitcoin 
I've done some work in this area. see  it's
currently shelved due to lack of legal and regulatory framework.
1. this should not be directly implemented on the protocol level. I believe
its Jeff Garzik who once said "stolen bitcoins is a legal problem, not a
technical one." Legal problems are not technical problems.
2. it is the responsibility of company and individuals to answer questions.
example, stolen bitcoins gets send to address X, and address X is a payment
address of company Y. it is company Y's responsibility to answer to
corresponding agencies responsible. What actions comes out of that is yet
to be determent.
other examples such as, you are using a wallet app, and sending bitcoin
payments to a known malicious address. ( e.g. crypto-locker or other
malware address that replaces the output address.), does the wallet app
warn its users?
Again, while these are not technical problems, they will need answers
eventually. I'll be happy to discuss further off this mailing list as it is

Nielsen's Law of Internet Bandwidth is simply not true, but if you look at
data points like  which will show we are at
least on the right track, but this is flawed still.
The fact of the matter is these speed tests are done from local origin to
local destination within the city, let alone the country ( see note about
how these test are only conducted 300 miles within the server). and our
current internet infrastructure is set up with CDNs for the web and media
these data points can not and should not be used to model the connectivity
of a peer to peer network.
Uplink bandwidth is scarce is China and expensive, avg about $37 per 1mbps
after 5, but this is not the real problem. the true issue lies in the
ISP transparent proxy they run. this is not a problem isolated in just
China, Thailand and various other countries in Asia like Lebanon. I have
also heard in various IRCs that southern France also face this similar
issue due to poor routing configurations they have that prevents
connections to certain parts of the world, unsure if this is a mistake or a
geopolitical by-product.
As for your question earlier Gavin, from Dallas TX to a VPS in Shanghai
on ????/Shanghai telecom, which is capped at 5mbps the data results match
my concerns, I've gotten low as 83 Kbits/sec and as high as 9.24 Mbits/sec.
and other ranges in between, none are consistent. ping avg is about 250ms.
The temporary solution I recommend again from earlier is MPTCP:
 which allows you to multiple
interfaces/networks for a single TCP connection, this is mainly developed
for mobile3g/wifi transition but I found uses to improve bandwidth and
connection stability on the go by combining a local wifi/ethernet
connection with my 3g phone tether. this allows you to set up a middlebox
somewhere, put shadowsocks server on it, and on your local machine you can
route all TCP traffic over the shadow socks client and MPTCP will
automatically pick the best path for upload and download.

Nice insight Peter,
This further confirms the real problem, which doesn't have much to do with
blocksize but rather the connectivity of nodes in countries with
not-so-friendly internet policies and deceptive connectivity.

I will abstain on this wrangle of "when",
Instead I'd like to address some of the network topology health issues
that's been brought up in this debate.
Due to how blocks are being broadcast by miners at the moment, it is not
difficult to find the origin node of these blocks. These more influential
origin nodes are a minority, about <100 out of ~6000, <2%. These data
points are important to certain attack vectors. It is highly recommended
that pools adopt broadcast logic that rotates broadcasting nodes and
increase their node count.. Eloipool has this implanted for those seeking
to adopt/see it in action in the wild.
China is a particular worse-case due to the sporadic nature of their
internet infrastructure, especially connecting from/to outside of gfw, on a
average node-walk I can get up to a 10% difference while I know for a fact
some of the nodes shown to be down are up.
In F2Pool's case, I see 6 replay nodes, I don't know if that's enough or
that's all the nodes F2Pool runs, but it may be beneficial to set up
multi-homing with shadowsocks over mptcp to increase the stability. also
see if you can get a CERNET connection to be part of your rotations since
their backbone is quite good.
comments, question and grievances welcome.

"We can look at the adoption of the last major Bitcoin core release to
guess how long it might take people to upgrade. 0.11.0 was released on 12
July, 2015. Twenty eight days later, about 38% of full nodes were running
that release. Three months later, about 50% of the network was running that
release, and six months later about 66% of the network was running some
flavor of 0.11."
On what grounds do you think it is reasonable to assume that this update
will roll out 6x faster than previous data suggested, as oppose to your own
observation of 66% adoption in 6 month. or do you believe 38% node
upgrade-coverage ( in 28 days ) on the network for a hard fork is good
There are no harm in choosing a longer grace period but picking one short
as 28 days you risk on alienating the nodes who do not upgrade with the
aggressive upgrade timeline you proposed.

Happy Lunar New Year Everyone!
The notion of large set ( 30% to 40% ) of un-maintained full nodes are not
evident on the network. below is data based on a personal snap shot taken
around Dec, 2015. with the following assumptions.
1) nodes running non standard version strings are considered a preference
by the node operator and are not included.
2) nodes below 0.10 are counted as so called "un-maintained" even though
they also can be a choice of the node operator.

Satoshi:0.8.6, 74
Satoshi:0.9.1, 49

Satoshi:0.9.0, 5
Satoshi:0.9.2, 5
Satoshi:0.8.0, 4
Satoshi:0.8.99, 1
Satoshi:0.8.4, 1
There are 406 nodes total that falls under the un-maintained category,
which is below 10% of the network.
Luke also have some data here that shows similar results.
I'm afraid we have to agree to disagree if you think dropping support for
60% of the nodes on the network when rolling out an upgrade is the sane
thousands of nodes?! where did you get this figure? who are these people?
*Please* elaborate.
I don't understand this statement at all, please explicate.
