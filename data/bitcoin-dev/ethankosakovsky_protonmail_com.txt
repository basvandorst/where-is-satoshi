Yes, I plan to submit as a BIP. I was just letting it sit for a while for others to consider.
I was also considering to split the BIP into two. One for the the entropy derivation, and the Applications section would be another BIP. This would be akin to how BIP32 is the basis for derivation schemes like BIP39, and BIP44, BIP49 etc.

I have opened a BIP PR at and also created a Python library with test vectors referenced in the BIP text. I am still unsure if I should or shouldnt split the BIP's "Applications" into a separate BIP or leave in the current BIP.

I would like to present a proposal for discussion and peer review. It aims to solve the problem of "too many seeds and too many backups" due to the many reasons stipulated in the proposal text.

This proposal provides a way to derive entropy from a HD keychain path in order to deterministically derive the initial entropy used to create keychain mnemonics and seeds.
BIP32 uses some initial entropy as a seed to deterministically derive a BIP32 root for hierarchical deterministic keychains. BIP39 introduced a method of encoding initial entropy into a mnemonic phrase which is used as input to a one way hash function in order to deterministically derive a BIP32 seed. The motivation behind mnemonic phrases was to make it easier for humans to backup and store offline. There are also other variations of this theme.
The initial motivation of BIP32 was to make handling of large numbers of private keys easier to manage and backup, since you only need one BIP32 seed to cover all possible keys in the keychain. In practice however, due to various wallet implementations and security models, the average user may be faced with the need to handle an ever growing number of seeds/mnemonics. This is due to incompatible wallet standards, hardware wallets (HWW), seed formats and standards, as well as, the need to used a mix of hot and cold wallets depending on the application and environment.
Examples would span wallets on mobile phones, online servers running protocols like Join Market or Lightning, and the difference between Electrum and BIP39 mnemonic seed formats. The reference implementation of Bitcoin Core uses BIP32, while other cryptocurrencies like Monero use different mnemonic encoding schemes.
We must also consider the different variety of physical backups including paper, metal and other physical storage devices, as well as the potentially splitting backups across different geographical locations. This complexity may result in less care being taken with subsequently generated seeds for new wallets need to be stored and it ultimately results in less security. In reality, the idea of having "one seed for all" has proven to be more difficult in practice than originally thought.
Since all these derivation schemes are deterministic based on some initial entropy, this proposal aims to solve the above problems by detailing a way to deterministically derive the initial entropy used for new root keychains using a single BIP32 style "master root key". This will allow one root key or mnemonic to derive any variety of different root keychains in whatever format is required (like BIP32 and BIP39 etc).
Input starts with a BIP32 seed. Derivation scheme uses the format `m/83696968'/type'/index'` where `type` is the final seed type, and `index` in the key index of the hardened child private key.
Entropy is calculated from the HMAC-SHA512(key=k, msg='bip-entropy-from-bip32') of the derived 32 byte private key (k). Entropy is taken from the result according to the number of bits required. This entropy can then be used as input to derive a mnemonic, wallet etc according to the `type` specified.
In order to maintain the widest compatibility, the input to this function is a BIP32 seed, which may or may not have been derived from a BIP39 like mnemonic scheme. This maintains the original motivation that one backup can store any and all child derivation schemes depending on the user's preference or hardware signing devices. For example, devices that store the HD seed as a BIP39 mnemonic, Electrum seed, or BIP32 root key would all be able to implement this standard.
This proposal could be split into multiple discrete BIPs in the same way that BIP32 described the derivation mechanics, BIP39 the input encoding with mnemonics, and the derivation paths like BIP44, BIP49 and BIP84. This has been avoided to reduce complexity. The resulting private key processed with HMAC-SHA512 and truncated as necessary. HMAC-SHA512 was chosen because it may have better compatibility in embedded devices as it's already required in devices supporting BIP32.

Yes thank you. I find abstracts hard, I will try again.
Currently I need a separate BIP30 for many of my wallets. I cant have one master seed for all my wallets because some are less safe than others and storing the master in each environment will increase the chance it could be compromised (e.g. hot environments). I cant export a hardened xprv from my main BIP32 keychain and import it to my JM/Android wallet because they dont support it. There's also a usability issue there since xprvs are not easy to type.
1. Join Market server (online)
2. Lightning node (online)
3. Trezor (offline)
4. Smartphone wallet with coffee money (online) (and no HWW support)
5. Bitcoin Core (doesn't use BIP39 at all)
I cannot use the same BIP39 seed across all these services. 1,2,4,5 are effectively hot wallets.
The problem is BIP39. BIP32 is fine but the backup process is not human friendly. It would have been better to simply serialize 128 or 256 bits of entropy into words like BIP39 does and be done with it. After that, it's all deterministic anyway. Instead BIP39 tries to ensure pseudorandom entropy by hash-stretching the initial entropy.
We can already export keychains from BIP32, as xprvs, but there is also no easy way to make as a human readable/typeable like BIP39 mnemonics. Most wallets don't allow you to import an xprv anyway, but again, good luck typing it.
What we are left with is an ecosystem that widely implements BIP39, so practically speaking if I want to use multiple wallets and cannot share an existing seed with that device, I need separate 12 or 24 word mnemonics. That's 5 times the complexity to store than one (in my case). I need a new cryptosteel. If I have two different geological locations for backup, it's hard to add more, since I need to travel. The whole point of BIP32 was one master key would rule them all - set up once, back up once and it's done. BIP39 was simply to make it human friendly to write down the seed on paper.
The easy solution as I see it is have one BIP39 mnemonic as my "master root key". From there it makes a BIP32 keychain and I can deterministically create child BIP39 seeds by taking a hardened path, using the private key as entropy ENT to create a new BIP39 mnemonic. If I do it this way I can have one initial backup, and if I need more wallets with a different seed, I can do it without worrying about backups. I'm future proof this way.

I think my proposal can be summarized simply:
1. get a child private key, hmac it and get entropy bits.
2. Use that entropy to feed BIP39 to make a new mnemonic seed
Bitcoin Core hdseed is a private key, so we can also do the same steps here
1. get a child private key, hmac it and get entropy bits.
2. Use that entropy to create a WIF to become the key for hdseed in Bitcoin Core.
I standardize this by using paths (like BIP44/49)
index allows me to generate multiple childs for that type.

Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts. I agree there are wide considerations surrounding key handling and storage. I dont think my proposal interferes with that perspective any more than BIP32 itself would. How keys are handled is a separate matter than the cryptography of key derivation and trying to get back to the one single backup that is future proof.
My proposal is not concerned with how the initial master key/seed is generated, just that we have one. My proposal is concerned with how to avoid having to generate more master keys because of the wide adoption of standards that impose restrictions (like BIP39); or the fragmented methods of initialization various wallets; as well as the instances where sharing the BIP39 seed with multiple wallets is undesirable due to security concerns (for example hot and offline wallet); or just plain incompatible standards.
If we were to start everything from scratch, we would obviously do things differently. However, there are already millions of wallets created using existing standards. It's just not possible to reset sadly.
I am proposing two separate things.
  - that we use fully hardened paths to derive keys in order to derive entropy.
  - that a BIP44 like derivation path can be used to describe what the entropy is intended for
    For example we use the prefix 83696968 (ASCII seed in decimal) `m/83696968'/type'/index'`
      - `type` defines how the entropy will be used
        `0` means use 128 bits of the entropy as input to BIP39, producing a 12 word BIP39 mnemonic
        `4` means use 256 bits of the entropy as the secret exponent to create a compressed WIF (for use as hdseed in Bitcoin Core)
    In this way, we can neatly define the specific use-cases of the entropy maintaining some order.
      - `index` is the key index so we can generate multiple instances of this type of entropy
To answer your question about whether to one-way-transform the resulting k. In practice, k is already safe because it was derived from a fully hardened path which protects the parent tree. However, the purpose here semantically is to be entropy. But k is not entropy, it's a private key on that derivation path. Neither are we exporting and xprv. We want entropy to seed the derivation of something else specified by the `type`. For that reason I consider it important to transform k by way of a hash or hmac. Using HMAC over hash is a decision based on an abundance of caution to ensure ward off unwanted side effects should k be used for a dual purpose, including as a nonce hash(k), where undesirable and unforeseen interactions could occur.
I am not proposing the nesting, although nothing would prohibit it, I'm just proposing one master root key from which all child keychains can be derived and overcome the incompatibilities and impracticalities detailed.
Sure! What's the URL of the Github?
