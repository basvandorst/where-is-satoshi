Some bitcoin "security vulnerabilities" have been discussed by Dan Kaminsky
at BH 2011, there is one article about this dated yesterday:
The article is very unspecific though. They talk about a tool called
"blitcoin" that "unmasks" both sides of a bitcoin transaction. A google
search also turned up nothing, except some misspellings.
Does anyone have more information?

Well it's good that the bitcoin network is seeing some security testing.
So I understand that we have a combination of problems at the moment:
1) A DDoS possibility  (if this is really the cause of the network
connectivity problems)
2) An attacker can figure out which node first broadcasted a transaction, by
connecting to the entire network or having everyone connect to his node(s)
3) The recipient re-broadcasts transactions (is Theymos right here?),
allowing both the sender and recipient to be found
Drawok's suggestion about using UDP packets with spoofed sender addresses is
interesting, as UDP has another advantage; you can open up an "inbound" UDP
port on almost any NAT router without any UPNP magic: just send out an UDP
packet, the router will wait a certain time for answers (on a mapped port
number) and relay these back.
It also has some potential issues; the client needs special privileges to
spoof sender addresses, and some ISPs might filter out packets with
non-matching sender addriess (unsure how common this is).

Hm this would potentially allow getting the IP for any recipient Bitcoin
address, given that a client with the private key connects to the network
once in a while.
Send them a transaction that is guaranteed to not be written into a block by
a miner, then monitor who rebroadcasts it over a few days/weeks.
I guess this could also be used to find out who has the stolen coins.

Yes. Optionally layering Bitcoin over Tor/I2P is a much better option than
trying to replicate an onion network in Bitcoin itself. For one,  traffic
analysis is much more difficult if your onion routing network contains
multiple kinds of traffic. Also it would complicate the core algorithm and
waste developer time. Doing anonymity *right* is very hard. So let's leave
it to the Tor/I2P people that know what they're doing.
Except the part about making the client/network more resistant against DDoS.

Right, while it doesn't warrant completely changing the transport protocol
to UDP or implementing onion routing,  I'm all for simple timing and order
randomization changes if they can make attacks like this less effective.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Change to multiple executables? 
In the current mainline client everything is lugged into one executable
(with an optional daemon-only one). I think this is a bad idea for various
reasons, and would propose something like:
   - bitcoind: bitcoin daemon
   - bitcoin(-qt): bitcoin GUI executable
   - bitcoincl: bitcoin RPC command line
By default, all three would be built. In non-GUI mode, only bitcoind and
bitcoincl are built (the names are obviously open for discussion).
   - It is more clear to the user. One command, one function.
   - It simplifies the main functions.
   - The UI would no longer double-function as daemon. It is a waste of
   memory to link the UI libs if you only want to run a background process.
   - The UI and daemon would no longer double-function as RPC call. Why load
   the code for UI and network if you just want to send a single command over
   JSONRPC?  This would also prevent accidentally launching the daemon/UI
   locally if you just want to send a command and forget to give an argument.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Change to multiple executables? 
UI would obviously still have RPC functionality with -server. I don't mean
dropping that. The UI links both the UI and the network code (for now, until
this is separated out and the preferred UI<->core communication method is
through RPC).
I just mean that the *headless* daemon is separate from the UI executable,
which is the case for any other sane client/server-based program in
existence, from bittorrent nodes to game servers.
It would also make it possible to build the command line RPC client
(bitcoin-cl) *without* building the server or UI. Useful if you want to
remotely control a Bitcoin daemon but not want to build it locally.

@_date: 2011-08-10 13:18:38
@_author: John Smith 
@_subject: [Bitcoin-development]  Change to multiple executables? 
No no no I never stated that the UI should no longer support RPC. If you
want the UI, with RPC, you can still run the UI executable with -server.
There are many usecases in which you want to access the UI bitcoin client
using RPC...
I only meant that it would also build the *headless* daemon by default, as
separate "bitcoind" executable. So you cannot run the UI exectuable as
headless server anymore. The -daemon option would go away. It would make the
setup a lot easier: The UI can connect to  X and display a splash screen
immediately without first looking at the command line arguments, whereas the
headless daemon can ignore all that stuff and get straight to work.
It's easy on windows:  just install Qt Creator (comes with the Qt SDK),
install the extra dependencies (build instructions are in README.rst), and
hit build.
On MacOSX I'm not sure.  I think it's similar, as a few people built it for
MacOSX and contributed settings for the .pro file...
It can build the GUI fine for every platform, however it can only build the
GUI, not the headless daemon or the command line client. You'd still need
old fashioned makefiles for those.
Cmake or autotools would be better, especially as those are intelligent
enough to auto-detect the name of libraries such as boost, and detect
presence of optional dependencies (miniupnp).

As the project is still in "experimental" phase I suppose people can expect
changes like this? And the change is pretty much trivial, and it makes sense
for a future direction (UI<->Wallet in separate processes for security
To be honest I feel a bit like every change that I (and I've also heard this
from others) propose is shot down, no matter how well formulated.  This is
actively discouraging developers from joining this project.

not perfect, and it makes sense to look ahead a bit.
I think it would be better to switch to two branches, like most other open
source projects I've worked with:

0.4.x -> trunk, more impactful changes, refactorings, eventual major release

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Change to multiple executables? 
I do think to be an successful open source project we need more developers
and more features. Activity is very important, it is kind of the lifeblood.
Yes, a project will generally become more stable and slow in time as it
nears "perfection" (or at least, a local optimum) but the current source is
*far* from that.
Yes -- bugs and scalability issues need to be addressed, but this will be a
lot easier if some underlying problems are solved. And if we ignore the end
users, they may run away and it becomes a pointless exercise.
Taking the "long view" this includes build system, handling of
threads/concurrency, modularization, pluggable DB and storage back-ends,
separating the system into multiple "locked-down" processes, and so on.
This can all be done while remaining P2P-compatible for as long as possible
(we have versioning, don't we?).
My proposal with multiple branches was about looking at the long view as
well as the immediate firefighting.  Yes, some changes might be riskier than
others, but we can't just cargo-cult Satoshi's work forever... so with
multiple branches, people can choose whether they have the balls to try
something newer or just want to run the older version with the issues they
know and love.
It's better to be open. Look at Open Office, it only started to un-stagnate
when it was forked out of Oracle's stranglehold. People want to work on
these things, so why not?
Until this is addressed, developers will prefer creating their own fork or
even alternative client. After this UI stuff is handled I'll probably join
up with one of them.
IMO this should have been your first reply, instead of first discourgaging
me from doing it. Just make a list of what needs to be done.
But I won't bother anymore... Let's just keep lumping everything in one
executable. It's the Satoshi way.
Exactly. My gripe is more about the negative attitude then anything else.
The focus is always on the negative sides of every proposal, a bit of a
climate of fear.
I've had an employer that worked in the same way. Eternally hammering on
"stability" the codebase, hiring 100's of extra developers, all firefighting
and fixing immediate issues with "priority", the code became a minefield.
Even with 8 hours of testcases, the overall structure of the code caused so
many issues that customers feared every new release more. A classic negative
feedback loop.
I understand where it is coming from, many people just come and dump their
"ideas" and never implement a line of code. But if people are actually
proposing to implement something, or implemented it, they should IMO be
given the benefit of the doubt. Not all outside ideas are bad.

Bitcoin-qt is now feature complete (including wallet encryption), and has

It is now in status of feature freeze.
The project builds on Windows, MacOSX and Linux using qmake.

is translations, currently we only have English, Dutch and Russian.

This weekend I closed some old github issues that are no longer

I've also closed some issues that deal purely with Wx UI issues like this
I think my statement is valid, that we no longer support the old UI? Or
maybe some people want to take up maintenance of the old UI? I don't think
that has very high priority, and should probably not be in the main project.
Some of the older issues are absolutely still relevant, but 150+ open
issues is not something to be proud of, and I wonder how other open source
projects deal with this without too much stepping on people's toes :-)

- CMake generates native build scripts for Make (all platforms), XCode,

- CMake has a clearer syntax, m4/autotools is very convoluted
- CMake is very fast
- CMake is supported natively in Qt Creator in the QT SDK, and is used by
many other KDE/QT as well as other open source applications. Many people
discourage the use of autotools for new projects.

For debians it's as simple as apt-get install cmake, which is not a big
problem as you need to install the other dependencies (such as boost) as
well to build.

It would change the sequence to

So a shell script named 'configure' that starts 'cmake .' is the most easy

So, what about native build script generation for other platforms? autotools
can only generate makefiles (with at least two intermediate code generation
steps), which is quite limited.
IMO cmake is simple and elegant compared to the autotools monster. I don't
see why it would be "just as bad". And I have quite some experience with
both systems. Autotools is a hell to debug. cmake certainly isn't perfect,
but at least it's a leap forward.
It also requires a dependency that isn't installed by default anywhere, as
Yes, apart from that only obscure projects such as LLVM,  Blender, and
OpenCV are using it. Nothing of any importance.
BTW for cmake there is "ccmake" which is even better than configure --help

It doesn't for the native build systems on at least Windows and OSX. Yes,

You don't need to use the UI. It's just a convenience. Command line can
simply be used if you want.

Hello devs,
For UI purposes I'd like to be able to associate metadata to transactions
and address book records.
To be clear, this is completely client-side and will never see the block
For transactions:
-   std::string description; // A description that the user can give to a
transaction, after he sent/received it, for example "ordered eggs"
For addresses:
-   bool visibleInInterface; // Visible in interface; useful to hide old
addresses/labels from the lists, without removing them for lookup purposes
These are my current ideas; probably, more metadata can be useful later on
(accounting category, links to 3rd party services, etc), so an extensible
system would be nice.
Any ideas as to what would be the best place to put this, while minimizing
the core changes?
I'm aware that this could also be implemented completely inside the UI code,
but I'm not sure this is nice, as it would put database handling etc there
and would mean even more data files for the user to backup/track.

Some refactoring would be much safer than trying to reproduce every nook and

core communication, and especially so that UIs no longer have to poll for
I propose to use the boost::signal mechanism for that. It is basically a
glorified callback system, but allows decoupled delivery of 'signals' from
an object. Multiple other objects can listen in on an event without the
emitting object having to care.
class CWallet { ...
    boost::signal balanceChanged;
void CWallet::newTx (...) {
    ...

GUI::balanceChanged(int64 new_balance) {
   someWidget->setValue(new_balance);
Specific notifications that would be useful:
   - balanceChanged(int64): spendable balance changed
   - transactionAdded(int256): new transaction added to wallet
   - transactionUpdated(int256): transaction info changed
   - transactionRemoved(int256): transaction removed from wallet (can this
   happen? for completeness)

   - notification(std::string message, int severity): warning/error occured
   in wallet processing, notify user
   - int askFee(std::string message, ...): ask user for fee

and developers)?
No speculation about economic or political futures, no philosophical pissing
contests, no "I trust/distrust this/that exchange/company" FUD, no repeated
discussion of things already answered in the FAQ, etc.
There is a place for all of those, but not in the official forums of an open
source project. IMO, if we link an official forum from bitcoin.org at all,
it should be a neutral place for helping people adopt the technology (a bit
like the Ubuntu forums, for example).

I think a simpler forum would also be easier to moderate. Main criterion: is
it helpful to users? If not, lock/remove it.
Two categories: Technical Support, Development (which can be split up
between client work, and other software/websites integrating bitcoin).
Those two can be replicated per language if a large enough group exists in
that country that is also willing to maintain order.
I have no problems with volunteering some time moderating, but not on the
current forums.
If this is really a capacity issue then IMO we should simply remove the link
and come up with an alternative medium to address user issues (such as a
moderated mailing list).  But I don't really believe this. There's a ton of
successful forums that did pick the right structure and helpful moderators,

influence on the project's direction. Which is making us as developers look
really bad. As if we're some political faction that wants to bring down
world governments and unleash a global anarchistic doomsday scenario.

On the other hand, I do like forums in general.  It would be nice have an
official help forum dedicated to just the client software (and protocol) and
how to use/integrate/modify it.  It should come with a link to the FAQ
before posting.
Also, as a mailing list is (kind of) limited to text only, a forum makes it
easier to discuss graphical subjects such as UI.
Then again given the kind of people bitcoin seems to attract, it might be
unrealistic to think a normal forum can be maintained... On the other hand,
people that misbehave can then be sent to the bitcointalk forums :-)

                addressRet.SetHash160((uint160)item.second);
            if (keystore == NULL || keystore->HaveKey(addressRet))
                return true;
        }
It will only return "true" on keys that are in the keystore (your own
private keys...). After commenting out the "if (keystore == NULL ..." line,
the display is fixed.
But that simple solution might have impact somewhere else.

Bounties would be much less than a developer salary. The idea is not to pay

Which, in many cases, is enough. Many times, fixing a bug is a few hours of
debugging, then fixing three lines of codes.
Sometimes it just takes a monkey to sit behind a PC and bash on it frantic
enough (with a debugger) to find and fix bugs :-) Competition to fix bugs is
(up to a certain level) good, it gets people off their ass. But I think the
competition problem is very hypothetical. It assumes there will suddenly be
*a lot* of people that want to fix the same bug. That's unrealistic...
Writing a few test-cases (which is better than the 0 we have now) also won't
take a Linus-level developer to work on it full time. A reasonable dev just
needs to put some time into it.
That leaves the more difficult work to the lead devs.
For a distributed currency I must say there is very little belief here in a
distributed process. Yes, you can also start a company and hire people to
work on it full time, but then they'll be working on helping customer not
solving bugs of the issue tracker (which might have an overlap, but not
necessarily). And it also isn't clear whether changes are contributed back
to the project.
You should not underestimate the open source community. There's a lot of
smart students eager to work on interesting, high-impact projects. Bitcoin
certainly fits that description, but the problem is that Bitcoin isn't
really that known yet with devs, and they need a little push to get
involved. And to work on the current code-base, because usually they will
look at the code and decide it's a piece of crap and want to rewrite it (new
people syndrome).
Yes, there might be one-time-and-run-off flakes, but hey that's life... you
only need to gain a few (semi)dedicated devs from it anyway, not recruit an
army of loyal minions.
I'm not saying this push has to be bounties. It could be a nice page, for
example just posting the bounties on the forum is a start, but certainly not
enough. They just get buried in troll poop, and a lot of the forum users are
... *psychological analysis removed*. You really want to reach out somehow.
It should at least have a nice page that attracts people on the
bitcoin.orgsite, and explains why you should work on Bitcoin (because
the project is so
awesome and fun) and some form of attribution (not just a mention in the
gitlog, but bounties is only one option) if you do manage to fix a bug.
Heck a scoreboard with "number of bugs squished" could be a start :-) We
need to be creative here...

Oops, should have gone to the list
BTW, talking about the unit testframework: It doesn't build here by default:
$ make -f makefile.unix test_bitcoin  USE_UPNP=
g++ -static  -o test_bitcoin  obj/test/test_bitcoin.o -Wl,-Bstatic -l
boost_system -l boost_filesystem -l boost_program_options -l boost_thread -l
db_cxx -l ssl -l crypto -Wl,-Bdynamic -l gthread-2.0 -l z -l dl -l pthread
(.text+0x20): undefined reference to `main'
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
make: *** [test_bitcoin] Error 1
Two ways to fix this:
1) Add  BOOST_TEST_DYN_LINK  to the top of test_bitcoin.cpp. This is
needed for dynamic linking.
2) Link boost_unit_test_framework statically
test_bitcoin: obj/test/test_bitcoin.o
        $(CXX) $(CFLAGS) -o $@ $(LIBPATHS) $^ $(LIBS) -Wl,-Bstatic
-lboost_unit_test_framework -Wl,-Bdynamic
(yes, it needs the switch to dynamic again at the end, otherwise libgcc will
be linked statically which results in an error ...)

I think my Qt GUI is pretty much ready for merging. I've been using it for a

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Speeding up "getbalance <account>" calls 
I think the easiest way to speed this up would be to scan the wallet every
time a block comes in or something else changes in the block chain (or, if
you prefer, some pre-set interval of N minutes). Then go over the entire
wallet and the accumulate balances for all accounts. This could be done in
amortized linear time using a hash_map.
1) This reduces the time the API takes to return the balance for an account
to a predictable, very short time. Just the time to look up the balance in
the hash table (and return 0 on miss). The number crunching happens in the
network thread, not while you're waiting on the API.
2) Less bug-prone than "incremental caching" as you propose, and doesn't
require determining which accounts are influenced by a new block
3) Block chain reorgs are no problem.

Hello Brian,

Indeed. It could make sense. That's the reason why Qt distinguishes strings
based on context as well as content.
But it could also be nonsense. Can you be more specific as to which strings?

Are you sure you want to require qmake for the daemon build?
I agree having a unified build system would be nice, but qmake doesn't add
anything for non-qt software. Better to stick with a makefile.
If the goal is 'making it easier for the user' maybe it'd be best to make a
bash script that wraps both, that builds the daemon if possible, and the UI
if possible, and converts command line flags.

Would it be possible to port some of the existing translations?
Well, the strings in the core can be reused one-on-one as the _ function is
mapped to the Qt translation function.
And some of the UI texts probably can be reused as well, at least for a
rough approximation.
The files will have to be converted, as Qt uses an XML-based format whereas
Wx uses a line-based one. Also, Qt translations have a "context"
(file/object) defined whereas in Wx the "msgid" is only the English text.
Nah, nothing that a bit of Python hacking can't solve.
Though IMHO its not a huge deal if qt is merged without all the
Exactly... if there is some time between Qt being merged and Wx being phased
out, translations can be added. The Qt translation tool (Qt Linguist) is
user friendly enough to be used by anyone.
Sounds fine with me,

You can put assignments on the commandline; for example,
qmake "CONFIG+=test" test.pro
Like in plain make, these variables can be used for conditionally
enabling/disabling libraries or other options in the .pro file.
(reminds me that I still need to add the USE_UPNP option)
Note that qmake is a pretty simple tool, optimized for conveniently building
Qt applications in a cross-platform way; it in no way compares to
cmake/autotools or another "full" build system. But it's enough for building
bitcoin-qt on the supported target architectures so that's good enough for
me... For "bitcoind" and "bitcoin-wx" you probably want to keep around the

Oh yes there is interest. I meant to reply but haven't been able to put much
energy in bitcoin development lately.
More strict privilege seperation between applications on a least-authority
basis is something that Ubuntu is certainly going to need if they're serious
with the app store thing (and want to keep up with Android and Macosx...).
This has been needed for a long time, and this would be useful for any
private data managed by applications running as the same user (ssh,
browsers, pgp, ...)

You have to rewrite the entire thing from scratch?
This is probably blasphemy but: how can it be compared to the android model,
with a UID per application/user, and thus layering the security on top of
current UNIX/ACL permissions?  Is another FS really needed?

There is a lot of complaining about this alert system, but I really don't

As others have already said, it's just a message. Even if someone managed to
compromise the private key, the most they could do is spam graffiti messages
or try phishing. There are much worse things that could happen to the
network (in which case an alert system could come in very handy). It's just
not worth worrying about.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Bitcoin-qt ready for merging 
It has been under development for a long time, the thread on the bitcointalk
forum is "substantial evidence" that many people are using it (also, I
receive quite a lot of mail about it, and the number of followers on github
steadily fluctuates around ~30).  So nothing obvious is broken, at least, I
think has worked better than the Wx UI for quite a while.
But as I've said before I'm fine with keeping bitcoin-qt as a parallel,
experimental, release for a while.  I think that's the only way to get more
testing with people that don't want to or can't build from source (could
just mark the download as "New GUI, experimental" or so...).
To be honest I think it should be merged at least as experimental ASAP, it
would save a lot of GUI complaints on the forum about things I've
implemented months ago already. However I will only put up a pull request as
soon as it is clear that it will actually be integrated. It is too much work
for me to keep the pull request up-to-date if it lingers for months like
many others have.

Sounds good. I'm also doubtful of depending on two crypto libraries when
OpenSSL does perfectly well.
However, losing compatibility with miners is not very nice. Is there really
not a way to compute midstate with OpenSSL?
