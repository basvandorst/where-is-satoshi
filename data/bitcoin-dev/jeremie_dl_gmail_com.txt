I doubt this list is for this kind of thing. I am following
bitcoin-development since a long time but never participated because I
believe discussions should be well-focused and I never had anything
relevant to say.
Evan, I am pretty sure that emails such as yours will cause the true
discussions between core-dev (or those closely graviting around) to
move elsewhere on a less public channel, where people like me won't be
able to follow them anymore. Thus my request: please post this kind of
things elsewhere, because you are hijacking a list just to target his
audience, but not to contribute relevant content. (A definition
usually describing spam).

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Partial wallet rescan 
Hi all,
Before starting to implement a patch for a specific need, I would like
to be sure that it was not written already and available somewhere.
This list is probably my best chance.
I would like to add an optional parameter  to "-rescan",
from which the rescan would then start. When performing the wallet
rescan, everything before the block number  would be
Thus, it would do pretty much the same thing as the wallet birthday
mechanism (which relies on nTimeFirstKey), the difference being that
the point in time where to start would be *explicitly* given by the
user, at launch time, on the command line. Another possiblity is to
provide as parameter a time stamp instead of a block height; the
interesting part for me is that anyway that information is explicitly
provided by the user.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Fwd: death by halving 
Answering today's concerns with yesterday's facts is dangerous,
especially with bitcoin on a 4 years period. I personally consider all
arguments like "we went through once, and nothing special. So no
disturbance worthy of discussion to expect" baseless.
Also, starting a topic with mentions of "death" is not leading to any
useful discussion.
 starters: don't oversell your topic with that kind of
vocabulary hype. "death by halving", seriously?
 else: don't focus on the chosen vocabulary, or use it to
discard what might be a relevant discussion topic.
The fact that a topic was brought up many times since a long time,
does not mean it is not relevant. It only means it is a recurring
concern. I read no convincing argument against a significant
disturbance of the mining market to come. The fact that it is known in
advance is no counter argument to me.
Environmental conditions will have changed so much, the next halving
occurence might have nothing to do with the previous one, and it
should be perfectly ok to discuss it instead of putting the whole
thing under the carpet.
What is most important to the discussion to me: the main difference
between the last halving and the one to come is the relative weight of
ideology vs. rationality in miners's motivations. Effectively putting
us closer to the original bitcoin premises (miners fully rational).
Miners were close to being 100% individuals last halving, they are now
largely for-profit companies. This isn't a change we can overlook with
pure maths or with previous experience.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Block Size Increase 
Any proposal to switch to a new hardcorded value so we have time to
*really* figure out later what's next and all implications, is a road
to a gigantic issue later when we want to switch to that "next".
Sure we would have more time to think about, research all
implications, simulate, discuss, etc. But the ability then to agree
enough on a change to roll it out successfully will be much smaller,
because of the economy being built on top of Bitcoin being much larger
and the technical specifications of Bitcoin being closer to a complete
What I'm trying to say is that we should look at long term lasting
solutions even if it takes more effort and time right now and puts the
network into some "troubles" for a while, because they're short term
"troubles". (You define "troubles", depending on which side you stand
at the moment...).
I personally believe in adaptive block size mechanisms, because:
(i) common sense tells me harcoding is never a solution for a system
    whose usage is for many aspects unpredictable
(ii) we can't rely on human consensus to adapt it (seeing the mess
     it is already this time).
It would have the advantage to place this block size issue entirely as
part of the algorithmic contract you agree on when you use Bitcoin,
similar to the difficulty adapation or the block reward.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Block Size Increase 
Looks like a solid description of what would happen.
I fail to see how this description wouldn't be applicable also to a
20MB-network in some time in the future, say ~3 years from now, if
Bitcoin keeps taking off.
If you agree that it will be harder in the future to change the block
limit again, and we switch to hardcoded 20MB, then aren't we just
going from an immediate relief to a future larger blockage?

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Hardfork to fix difficulty drop algorithm 
Could you be more explicit, which altcoin is that?
Probably not until you get to the details of any proposal. What is
your exact proposal here? Algorithm? Parameters?
As you likely know a too short time window would be dangerous for
other reasons. Getting to an agreement as to what is reasonable or not
is not necessarily trivial.
