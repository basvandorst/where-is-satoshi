@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] TestNet block starved? 
Any idea what's going on with TestNet?  No blocks for nearly 2 hours now,
according to multiple block explorers (blockr.io, my own bitcoin node, etc).
Prior to the last block (530516), there were a lot of blocks with zero
transactions and only an occasional block with a ton of txs.
Any info?

I like the simplicity of this approach.  Demand driven response.
Is there really a need to reduce the max block size at all?  It is just a
maximum limit, not a required size for every block.  If a seasonal
transaction surge bumps the max block size limit up a notch, what harm is
there in leaving the max block size limit at the "high water mark"
indefinitely, even though periods of decreased transaction volume?
I'd argue to remove the reduction step, making the max block size
calculation a monotonic increasing function. Cut the complexity in half.

Ya, so?  All that means is that the experiment might reach the hard fork
tipping point faster than mainnet would. Verifying that the network can
handle such transitions, and how larger blocks affect the network, is the
point of testing.
And when I refer to testnet, I mean the public global testnet blockchain,

Again, I'm not suggesting further testing in sterile environments.  I'm
suggesting testing on the public global testnet network, so that real-world
hazards such as network lag, bandwidth constraints, traffic bottlenecks,
etc can wreak what havoc they can on the proposed implementation.  Also, a
test deployment would give more people an opportunity to see how the
proposed implementation works and "kick the tires", which might help to
reduce some degree of angst about the proposals.
Your point appears to be that the biggest challenge facing Bitcoin is not
technical, but political. Sadly, you may be right.

How do "big-block" testnet nodes running this 6382 rev recognize each other
on the peer network? If I set up a 2MB block limit testnet node and
-addnode another 2MB block testnet node (say, JornC's node) to it, and my
node mines a block stuffed with 1.3MB of test txs, the other "big-block"
node should accept my mined block, but it will be rejected / immediately
orphaned by the rest of the testnet network because it exceeds their notion
of block size limit, correct?

The limits Alex proposed are generous (bordering on obscene!), but dropping
that down to allowing only two levels of chained unconfirmed transactions
is too tight.
Use case: Brokered asset transfers may require sets of transactions with a
dependency tree depth of 3 to be published together. ( N seller txs, 1
broker bridge tx, M buyer txs )
If the originally proposed depth limit of 100 does not provide a sufficient
cap on memory consumption or loop/recursion depth, a depth limit of 10
would provide plenty of headroom for this 3 level use case and similar

Having thousands of utxos floating around for a single address is clearly a
bad thing - it creates a lot of memory load on bitcoin nodes.
However, having only one utxo for an address is also a bad thing, for
concurrent operations.
Having "several" utxos available to spend is good for parallelism, so that
2 or more tasks which are spending from the same address don't have to line
up single file waiting for one of the tasks to publish a tx first so that
the next task can spend the (unconfirmed) change output of the first.
Requiring/Forcing/Having a single output carry the entire balance of an
address does not work at scale. (Yes, this presumes that the tasks are
coordinated so that they don't attempt to spend the same outputs. Internal
coordination is solvable.)
In multiple replies, you push for having "all" utxos of an address spent in
one transaction.  Why all?  If the objective is to reduce the size of the
utxo pool, it would be sufficient simply to recommend that wallets and
other spenders consume more utxos than they create, on average.
I'm ok with "consume more utxos than you generate" as a good citizen / best
practices recommendation, but a requirement that all prior outputs must be
spent in one transaction seems excessive and impractical.

Apologies if this has already been stated and I missed it, but:
Can transactions in a buried block be overridden/replaced by RBF?
Or is RBF strictly limited to transactions that have not yet been
incorporated into a block?

@_date: 2015-05-26 15:09:35
@_author: Danny Thorpe 
@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] First-Seen-Safe Replace-by-Fee 
Thanks for the clarification.
So, since RBF applies only to pending transactions in the mempool awaiting
incorporation into a block, there is a window of opportunity in which the
pending tx is incorporated into a block at the same time that the spender
is constructing and publishing a replacement for that pending tx.
The replacement transaction would be rejected by the peer network as a
double spend because it conflicts with the now confirmed original tx, and
the spender will have to go back and create a new stand-alone transaction
to accomplish what they hoped to do with an RBF replacement.
So an implementation that wishes to take advantage of RBF will still need
to have a "plan B" implementation path to handle the corner case of a
replacement tx being rejected as a double spend.
Is this correct?
I'm just trying to get my head around the implementation cost vs benefit of
RBF in the context of my applications.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] [BIP] Normalized transaction IDs 
A signer modifying the order of inputs or changing outputs when
"re-signing" a transaction (which already has dependent child transactions
spending its outputs) seems like quite a different hazard than a malicious
third party modifying a transaction in the mempool by twiddling opcodes in
the signature scripts.  The former seems like more a matter of keeping your
own house in order (an internal affair) while the latter is an external
threat beyond the transaction writer's control.
While I agree that having a canonical ordering for inputs and outputs might
be useful in some cases, there are also use cases where the relative
positions of inputs and outputs are significant, where reordering would
change the semantics of the transaction.  SIGHASH_SINGLE, for example,
makes an association between an input index and an output index. Open Asset
colored coins are identified by the order of inputs and outputs.
Let's keep canonical ordering separate from the normalized transaction ID
proposal. Baby steps. Normalized transaction IDs provide an immediate
benefit against the hazard of third party manipulation of transactions in
the mempool, even without canonical ordering.

Few bitcoin library implementations use the same string names for mainnet

"With a very powerful "Desktop" machine bitcoin-qt dominates CPU/GPU
That doesn't match my experience.
System responsiveness / user experience can suffer when running bitcoin-qt

and severely disrupt the user experience.

The initial blockchain synchronization / "catch up" is CPU and disk
intensive, but after initial sync I find bitcoin-qt uses only a trivial
amount of CPU to keep up with verifying new blocks and new transactions.
Running bitcoin-qt occasionally is a much more painful user experience than
running bitcoin-qt continuously.
I'm running Bitcoin Core v0.12.rc2 on an old dual core Pentium E2160 at
1.8GHz, 6GB RAM, 64 bit Windows 10, with the Bitcoin data on SSD. This
system is about 6 years old and was an economy model even when new. Not
what I would call a powerful system. I've only added RAM and the SSD.
On that machine I run two instances of Bitcoin-qt - one for mainnet, and
another for testnet, and an instance of bfgminer to manage a handful of USB
Block Eruptors for testnet mining. Both bitcoin-qt instances are typically
at their max of 25 connections (each). Total CPU load floats around 11%,
with only occasional spikes to 40% for a few seconds.  The mainnet
bitcoin-qt process uses about 700MB of RAM, testnet about 300MB.
This machine did fall into disk grinding paralysis during initial sync /
catchup with the v0.10 and v0.11 builds of bitcoin-qt, when the Bitcoin
data was on a spinning disk. Moving the Bitcoin data to an SSD drive had
the greatest impact on breaking the disk-bound whole-system paralysis.
Increasing the system RAM, upgrading to v0.12, and upgrading the OS to Win
10 all contributed smaller improvements.
It is possible to run a full node on a small desktop machine concurrent
with user apps. Just get the Bitcoin data off of spinning media and onto
