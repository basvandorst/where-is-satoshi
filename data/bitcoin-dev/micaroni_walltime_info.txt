@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Transifex administration 
G'day great devs,
How can I gain status of maintainer, admin or / and reviewer in  ?
I'd like to set the description, project logo and whatever is missing on Bitcoin project inside Transifex. I believe if it is better configured it can attract more contributors. Of course my English is not perfect how you can see, but surely I'll copy the description from wiki, source code docs and other fonts written in native English. The logo I'll set the official one.
Also, I want to be able to make review in Portuguese BR. Unapologetically my Portuguese is perfect, I studied the grammar several years and I am native speaker. I've been contributing in Portuguese BR and yesterday I completed the 35% missing translations.
Thank you so much in advance,
Felipe Micaroni Lalli

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] About the small number of bitcoin nodes 
Is the small number of bitcoin nodes a concern? If yes, why? What kind of attack can the network suffer? And where can we find statistical information about the full nodes running?
I guess the only effective incentive to keep a node running would be financial. A kind of proof of stake would be nice on bitcoin. But I have no idea how to begin with.

Hash: SHA1
This feature makes possible Bitcoin Core to read a balance of any
public address via RPC call or, after importing the balance, it became
available only via QT interface?
