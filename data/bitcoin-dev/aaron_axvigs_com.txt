@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] "bits": Unit of account 
That piece of horse equipment is called a bit in the US too.  But the point
stands: most people don't use "bit" on a daily basis other than referring to
"a little bit of ."

That's a very anglocentric way of thinking.
Here in the Netherlands, a "bit" is something you put in a horses's mouth.
It's also used as imported word (in the information sense).
We've never used the term for money.
