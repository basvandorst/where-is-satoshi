Of course, if only a small percentage of mining power adopts this
scheme, everyone that does so will presumably be harming themselves by
doing so since they're essentially increasing the odds that the next
block they mine will become invalid...

The error about not finding boost is a red herring and as far as I can
tell bogus. The problem is that it finds Qt and tries to configure
some Qt code that doesn't seem to have actually been released. Try
Also, you'll probably need to set BDB_INCLUDE_PATH manually or it
won't find db.h
Hope this helps,

I think that tag's in

v0.5.2 may not have been pushed to the official github repository.

Should do (unless BIP 16 broke something). In fact both the GUI and
RPC commands use CBitcoinAddress and IsValid to validate addresses in
that way.
Again, should do, and it's used by the RPC commands for sending
Bitcoins as well. Really there's not a lot that needs to be changed.
I'm pretty sure even the change in MaxAddressLength is only necessary
to send coins to multisig addresses on testnet, sending them on
mainnet should just work.

That's actually slower-than-Atom class hardware you're running on
there, with full disk encryption on what's a very CPU and IO-heavy
workload. From the benchmarks I remember, your CPU is literally slower
than the first generation of single-core netbooks - the ones reviewers
recommended against using full disk encryption on because they just
didn't have enough CPU power to manage it. It's not surprising that
Bitcoin isn't usable on that setup.
