1.- At some point in time, fees will need to be the the main part of the reward of miners, so, I do not see any need to lower them. If we keep them forever low, the network will be less and less secure because of the halvings.
2.- I think this change involves a Hard Fork (please correct me if I am wrong). In my opinion, the risk of a HF is not worth it.
3.- And more important for me, If blocks get bigger and bigger it would hurt decentralization which is absolutely key for Bitcoin to be valuable.
