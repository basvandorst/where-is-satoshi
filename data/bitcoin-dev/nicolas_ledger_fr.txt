any Java Card supporting ECC can sign on user supplied Weierstrass curve
parameters - you can find a good shopping list at
 (look for ALG_ECDSA_SHA256 on
javacard.crypto.signature). The NXP JCOP platform (found in Yubico Neo) is
a popular choice, and then you can add your own custom logic for validation.

I'd also agree with this - and it's convenient to test against simulators /

ACK for Ledger. What's necessary to sign a transaction is well known, I
don't see how driving any hardware wallet from the wallet itself or from a
third party daemon implementing that URL scheme would make any difference,
other than providing better devices interoperability, as well as easier
maintenance and update paths for the wallets.
