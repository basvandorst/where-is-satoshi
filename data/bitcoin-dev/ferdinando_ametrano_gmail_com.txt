In november 2008 bitcoin was a much younger ecosystem, with less liquidity
and trading, smaller market cap, and the halving happened during a quite
stable positive price trend.
In the next months competition might easily drive down mining margins, and
the reward halving might generate unexpected disruption in mining
Moreover, halving is not strictly necessary to respect the spirit of
Nakamoto's monetary rule and its 21M limit. At the beginning of the 3rd
reward era (block 420000, in 2017) a new reward function could become
effective R(b)=k*2^(-h*b/210000) where b is the block number and R(b) is
the reward. The parameters h and k can be calibrated so that R(419999)=25
and sum_b{R}=21M
?If the increased issuance speed in the third era is considered
problematic, then each era could have its own R_e(b)=k_e*2^(-h_e*b/210000)
fitted to the amount of coins to be issued in that era according to the
current supply rule, e.g. fitting k_e and h_e to R(419999)=25 and
Would such a BIP have any chance to be considered? Am I missing something?

:-) I meant 2012, of course, but loved your wit
who said the contrary?
This thread is, in my opinion, a waste of time.

I would love a proper rebuttal of a basic economic argument. If increased
competition will push mining revenues below 200% of operational costs, then
the halving will suddenly switch off many non profitable mining resources.
As of now the cost per block is probably already about 100USD, probably in
the 50-150USD.
Dismissed mining resources might even become cheaply available for
malevolent agents considering a 51% attack. Moreover the timing would be
perfect for the burst of any existing cloud hashing Ponzi scheme.

because mining profits are many times operational costs. This might change
because of competition, in that case halving in price will become
It amazes me that basic economic considerations seems completely lost here,
especially when it comes to mining. We should have learned the lesson of
how a small error in the incentive structure has lead from "one CPU, one
vote" to an oligopoly which might easily become a monopoly in the near

On Tue, Oct 28, 2014 at 11:00 PM, Thomas Zander I didn't start the thread and so didn't research the archive. Until two
posts ago there was no reference about the issue being discussed before. A
link would have been much kinder than harsh dismissal. I will research and

yes, you're right I meant about $100USD per BTC, i.e. $2500 per block.
Because of my mistake I'll shut up and go back researching the archive on
this issue.
Thank you for the kind summary of the many good reasons why halving is a
non-issue. Very much appreciated, especially considering how precious is
your time.
