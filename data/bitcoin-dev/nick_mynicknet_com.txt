You must be new here. MtGox very rarely comments on things like this publicly, outside of irc or their website. Second, MtGox problem is a MtGox problem. You have no right to demand access to their private code. If you feel wronged as a customer, sue them. Otherwise, they have no obligation to you.
I believe you are "barking up the wrong tree".
