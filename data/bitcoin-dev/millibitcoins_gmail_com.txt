(not sure so sent again after subscribing (one use case added))
Dear Bitcoin developers,
Below is provided a draft BIP proposal for a master mnemonic sentence from which other mnemonics sentences can be derived in a deterministic non-reversible way (on an offline computer). This would make it much easier to split funds into smaller fractions and use those in a HD-wallet when appropriate (just by inserting 12 or more words), without ever putting the master mnemonic at risk on an online computer. But there are many more use cases.
A reference implementation, specifically for use with a Trezor, has been generated and can be found at: I'm not a professional programmer or cryptographer, so the idea and reference implementation will probably need a lot of reviewing but I do think Bitcoin needs this extension and the corresponding ease of use and improved security model.
In the hope you like the idea,
   BIP: ???
   Title: Derived mnemonics from a master mnemonic.

This BIP??? uses a master mnemonic sentence, as described in BIP39, for the deterministic generation of derived mnemonic sentences. The derived mnemonics are of the same format as the master mnemonic but can consist of a higher or lower number of words.
Binary seeds can then be generated for derived mnemonics (and master mnemonic) as described in BIP39. Each of these seeds can be used to generate deterministic wallets using BIP-0032 or similar methods.
A mnemonic code or sentence is superior for human interaction as described in BIP39 and can, for example, be written on paper or even memorized. However, once a mnemonic has been used online, even through the use of a hardware wallet, the mnemonic could be compromised. This should be considered a bad practice from a security standpoint.
We therefore propose the generation of a master mnemonic offline and from this generate (also offline) multiple derived mnemonics in a deterministic way for online use. The master mnemonic is never used online and the master mnemonic cannot be obtained from the derived mnemonics. Examples of use cases are described below.
==Generating the master mnemonic==
The master mnemonic is first derived as a standard mnemonic as described in BIP39.
==From master mnemonic to derived mnemonics==
 From the master mnemonic a new string is created:
string = MasterMnemonic + " " + Count + " " + Strength;
Here, MasterMnemonic are the space separated words of the master mnemonic. Count = 0, 1, 2 denotes the different derived mnemonics of a given strength and Strength = numWords / 3 * 32, where numWords is the number of words desired for the derived mnemonic and only integer arithmetic is used in the calculation (e.g. for numWords = 14, Strength = 128). Both Count and Strength are converted to strings.
This string is then hashed using sha512:
hash = sha512(string);
and turned into a byte array:
for (var i=0; i>> ((i%4)*8)) & 0b11111111;
This byte array is then used to generate a new mnemonic as shown in the reference implementation using the method described in BIP39. The core of the new code in the reference manual can be found by jumping to "start: new code" in the reference software.
A passphrase for the master mnemonic has the same effect on the derived mnemoncis (so must be included).
==Reference Implementation==
The reference implementation generates addresses based on BIP44 for a 24 word master mnemonic and is available from
github (not yet)
==Checking the derived mnemonics using Electrum==
The displayed addresses in each of the reference implementations can be easily checked using Electrum in the following manner:
move the directory ~/.electrum to a backup directory.
start Electrum and choose:
Restore a wallet or import keys
Hardware wallet
Restore Electum wallet from device seed words
TREZOR wallet
Insert one of the mnemonics and check that the same addresses are generated by Electrum
Check the private keys:
move the directory ~/.electrum to a backup directory.
start Electrum and choose:
Restore a wallet or import keys
Standard wallet
Import one of the private keys and check that the correct address has been generated.
Some checks should include a passphrase.
==Examples of Use Cases==
A person with 25 bitcoin splits funds using 5 derived mnemonics and sends 5 bitcoins to the first address of each derived mnemonic. He can then use a (hardware) HD-wallet and simply insert one of the derived mnemonics to put only 5 bitcoins online and at risk at once. All funds can be recovered from the master mnemonic.
A person wants to give 10 bitcoin to each of his family members, giving each participant a derived mnemonic and sending bitcoin to each of them. The donating person can always recover the derived mnemonic if one of his family members loses his derived mnemonic.
For his Trezor wallet, someone wants to memorize only a 12 words master seed but wants to insert a 24 words derived seed so a key logger on his computer has 24! possibilities to check and not 12! (not a possibility for the current reference implementation but trivial to add).

Why not use "coinbit". A bitcoin is equal to 1 million coinbits.
A bit could then be seen/used as an abbreviation of coinbit.
