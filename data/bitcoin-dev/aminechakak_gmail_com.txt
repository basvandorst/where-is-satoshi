@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP - Symbol for satoshi 
I don't know if this is the right place to do so, but it says on the
website to first propose ideas for BIPS to the mailing list.
I would like to propose  idea for a satoshi symbol (monetary).

The lightning network uses satoshis as a base unit.
Here is the proposal :
Pleas let me know if it would be appropriate to write a BIP for it.
Thank you for your consideration.
