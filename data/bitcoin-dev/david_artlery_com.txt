@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP proposal: Increase block size limit to 2 
I saw this in your blog post:
"Miners producing up-version blocks is a coordination mechanism. Other coordination mechanisms are possible? there could be a centrally determined ?flag day? or ?flag block? when everybody (or almost everybody) agrees that a change will happen."
Can you describe this a bit more? How would either a "flag day" or "flag block" work as an alternative and why did you decide against them?
More thoughts and questions inline, thanks!
Can you explain and justify why that is the case? It would be nice to see that rationale laid out more fully as to why it's no different.
I'm not familiar with the context of your slack discussion, but why would you wait to summarize that only after the first-greater-than-1mb-block?
Is there a way to provide more transparency and visibility into that process and level of readiness? Is there an expectation of certain levels of readiness here before certain other things happen? I was thinking it would be really useful to have a visual timeline of events associated with all of this. Maybe you could add that to one of your web pages?
Well that, but also past performance isn't an indication of future performance, necessarily. They might have gone out of business, to give one example. There is surely assumed self-interest, but I have also seen rumors floating around of this being used as an arbitrage opportunity. Would suck to imagine that ever happening, but since this seems like it's being managed on more handshake type of deals (or conversations), are there any legal documents backing those commitments up? Or is that definitely overkill?
Maybe it's worth documenting the full range of possible series of events and then their presumed level of unlikelihood? "What can go wrong will go wrong", "Black Swan" events, type of considerations. :) Often when people discuss unlikely things like crypto being broken, it's like, "Assuming processing power of x, increasing at a rate of x, and a known age of the universe of x, it would take a billion times the known length of the universe for that to happen".
Certainly not everything fits so easily into that framing, but it would be really helpful to see the "what could possibly go wrong" things fully enumerated.
