It kills Bitcoin as a store of value.  Disk space is not the problem; bandwidth is.  The blockchain won't go to infinity as you suggest, as it is bounded by certain constraints.  It's growth is a function of the transactions in a block, and the number of blocks is linear in growth.  Sent from my iPhone
