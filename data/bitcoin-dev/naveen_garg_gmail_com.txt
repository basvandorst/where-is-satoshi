Here is a business idea:
customers send you a bitcoin transaction printed on paper.
You scan the transaction and broadcast it to the network.
Your fee could be the greater of some minimum or like 0.01% of the
transaction value.
The fee could be sent as just another paper transaction, it could even just
be cash.
You could expand into a snailmail based email or publishing platform.
Customers send you a letter.
You make the letter available in one or more of the following forms:
1. as a single webpage
2. sent via email to a specified address
3. in a data dump along with all open letters received that day / week /
month / year / or decade.

Make a transaction with two outputs.  Output A is your payee.  Output B is a fee to whoever transmits the transaction to the network.  Sign and print the transaction, along with private key controlling address of output B.  Put it in the mail with instructions to 1 or more greedy people who don't know you.   Does namecoin allow mixing outputs for name registration with pay to hash outputs ?  If so, you could use namecoin for anonymous publishing via post.  Or just make output A in bitcoin scripted with op_return if its a 40byte tweet.
