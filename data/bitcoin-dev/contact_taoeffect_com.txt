@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Crossing the line? [Was: Re: Let's deploy BIP65 
Dear list,
Mike has made a variety of false and damaging statements about Bitcoin, of which this is but one:
On plan99.net  there are several embedded videos that refer to him a ?core developer? of Bitcoin. And now it seems he is claiming to be Satoshi.
It seems to me that Mike?s emails, false statements (like the one above about coining SPV), arguments, and his attempts to steal control of Bitcoin via the contentious Bitcoin XT fork, represent actions that have been harming and dividing this community for several years now.
In many communities/tribes, there exists a line that, once crossed, results in the expulsion of a member from the community.
So, two questions:
1. Does the Bitcoin-devs mailing list have such a line?
2. If so, does the community feel that Mike Hearn has crossed it? (I personally feel he has. Multiple times.)
Thanks for your thoughts,
Greg Slepak

Hard forks should always come in response to some major crisis that all participants can agree is an actual crisis, as per the excellent rational here:
And here:
Also, if you?re going to do a hard fork, you?d better make the most of it as hard forks must be a *rare* world-is-ending-if-we-don?t-do-it thing (otherwise Bitcoin cannot be considered decentralized in any sense of the word).
So for any sort of hard fork, be sure to address the real threats and challenges that are facing Bitcoin today:
1. Mining centralization.
2. Privacy.

Look, if we?re going to declare something an emergency, we cannot on the one hand say things like: "I strongly believe bitcoin has no place in the world if the fee raise much higher than a few cents per typically-sized transaction?, and on the other declare that there is an emergency worth redefining what *Bitcoin is* because the average txn fee is on the order of 7 cents [1] and has remained reasonable for some time [2].
If you?d like to understand what a qualifying emergency looks like, read the links:
In terms of scaling, we are nowhere close to an emergency.
Scaling is priority  maybe, and it?s being taken care of.
Meanwhile, we should be directing our attention one the more pressing and serious concerns like mining centralization & privacy.
Mining centralization is a serious issue. It is *not cool* that 4 dudes (and 1 government) have the power to redefine what Bitcoin is *right now*.
Relevant post with suggestions for fixing that:
As far as I can tell, P2Pool & GBT are not the same thing, but I?ve been told that P2Pool might use GBT in some way, even though it?s listed on the wiki as not using it. [3]
A hard fork would ideally enforce decentralized mining pools somehow so that transaction selection is done at the edges instead of the center.

Dear Paul,
Drivechain has several issues that you've acknowledged but have not, IMO, adequately (at all really) addressed [1].
I think there are far safer solutions for scaling Bitcoin and integrating it with other chains than DC, which is again, a serious security risk to the whole network, as per [1].
Adopting DC would be an irreversible course of action, and one that in my opinion would unnecessarily damage not only other sidechains, but the main chain as well.
There is no rush, a proper solution is likely to present itself (I even have one that I'm toying with, but it's not quite ready yet for publication). I'm sure others are thinking similar thoughts too.

There is a difference between replying to an email, and addressing the issues that were brought up in it.
I did read your reply, and I chose not to respond to it because it did not address anything I said.
Here's an example:
Here, you admit that the security of the sidechains allows miners to steal bitcoins, something they cannot do currently.
You next tried to equate three different types of theft, what you called "Classic Theft", "Channel Theft", and "Drivechain Theft", saying:
To anyone who understands bitcoin, there is a very clear, unmistakeable difference between double-spending ("Classic Theft"), and *ownership* of the private key controlling the bitcoins.
Similarly, to anyone who understands bitcoin, there is also a very clear, unmistakeable difference between censorship ("Channel Theft"), and *ownership* of the private key controlling the bitcoins.
The entire email was a very long-form way of admitting to all of the issues that were raised in the previous email, while making it sound like you had addressed the issues.
I am not sure how else to respond to that email, given that none of the issues were really addressed.
Drivechain is an unmistakeable weakening of Bitcoin's security guarantees. This you have not denied.
There is no reason to weaken Bitcoin's security in such a dramatic fashion. Better options are being worked on, they just take time.

Dear Chris,
I have heard this nonsense repeated countless times in order to justify adopting Drivechain.
This is not how security works.
A child can "opt-in" to using a loaded gun, but is it a good idea to make it easy for them to do that?
This is effectively the same thing Drivechains is doing.
It is a request to modify the Bitcoin protocol to make it easy for Bitcoin users to give their Bitcoins to miners.
Does that sound like a good idea to anyone?
If so, please leave, you are compromising Bitcoin's security.
Security is about making it difficult to shoot yourself in the face.
If I design a car that has a button that randomly causes the brakes to give out if pressed, is that a good idea? Can I justify pushing for such a "feature" just because it's "opt-in"?
No. That is fallacy.
It is not how secure systems are designed.

I think he has been rather misleading in his presentation of the risks.
He outlines them in a very technical manner, yes, but then goes on to promote them to lay people as if they're no big deal, which is completely misleading.
That is completely different.
It is disingenuous to say the two are remotely similar. The two situations have little-to-nothing in common.
In the present situation, anyone-can-spend outputs are used by probably less than 0.1% of users, and most software doesn't even allow for the possibility.
In Drivechain it's *encouraged-by-design*!

That's a fair point, I confused anyone-can-spend with anyone-can-pay [1].
Isn't it different in the case of P2SH and SegWit, don't full nodes validate the script?
In other words, miners don't have complete control over the coins, full nodes keep a check on them.
At least that was my understanding, and if that's not the case then it doesn't make sense to me why Pieter would earlier in this thread object to Drivechain on the grounds that it's a different security model.

I'm assuming it's OK with you that I pick up from where we left off in the "Scaling Roadmap" thread [1], so as to be on-topic per your request. (For others reading, part of my reply to the previous email in this thread is here [2]).
For reference, I said:
CryptAxe's response was in part:
I am now looking closer again at step number 4 in the Drivechain specification [2]:
4. Everyone waits for a period of, say, 3 days. This gives everyone an opportunity to make sure the same WT^ is in both the Bitcoin coinbase and the Sidechain header. If they?re different, everyone has plenty of time to contact each other, figure out what is going on, and restart the process until its right.
It seems to me that where our disagreement lies is in this point.
The Drivechain spec seems to claim that its use of anyone-can-pay is the same as P2SH (and in later emails you reference SegWit as well). Is this really true?
The following suggests to me it isn't:
1. Pieter Wuille's email suggests he disagrees [4]
2. Per the question in [1], it's my understanding that P2SH transactions contain all of the information within themselves for full nodes to act as a check on miners mishandling the anyone-can-spend nature of P2SH transactions. However, that does not seem to be the case with WT^ transactions.
In P2SH txns, there is no need for anyone to, as the Drivechain spec says, "to contact each other, figure out what is going on". Everything just automatically works.
If the security of WT^ transactions could be brought up to actually be in line with the security of P2SH and SegWit transactions, then I would have far less to object to.

I'm right here, are you having a conversation with me or are you on a stage talking to an audience?
What does that have to do with my question? The counting period, if I understood correctly, is something miners do, not full nodes.
Also, if the document is old and/or outdated, do you happen to have a link to a more update-to-date version of the spec? It would be helpful for review.
Right, for [DC and [DC but for [DC an [DC you marked it as "Yes" without substantiating why you did so.
And that is not how P2SH works.
How is that an answer to my question?
What does "[DC and [DC would certainly have an interest in understanding what is going on" mean?
In P2SH, all upgraded nodes will reject invalid P2SH transactions, period.
What exactly would [DC and [DC nodes do when faced with an invalid WT^ transaction ? invalid in the sense that it contains funds which miners are stealing?
Again, in P2SH miners cannot steal funds, because all full nodes have a fully automatic enforcement policy.

Dear Paul,
I may very well have confused who counts what, but for this discussion on *theft* it's irrelevant, so I won't push further on this.
Let's move on to the theft.
To be crystal clear: I am entirely uninterested in the un-upgraded nodes, what you call [DC
They are irrelevant to my argument.
This is false.
For miners to steal P2SH funds, the P2SH script would have to be coded to explicitly allow them to do it.
How many P2SH scripts are you aware of that are used for the purpose of facilitating such theft?
I know of none, and I bet there are none.
Whereas in DC, every single usage of DC allows miners to steal funds.
It appears you are playing games with the meaning of "invalid" here, so that sentence is invalid.
I was very clear what I meant by "invalid" in my email: WT^ transactions that represent miners stealing funds. Please stick to that and do not play word games.
So, here you are again re-affirming that WT^ transactions representing stolen funds are allowed in DC, and by tying them all together you are also affirming that the SPV proofs mentioned in DC are completely irrelevant / pointless / unused.
So in the first sentence you say they "cannot steal funds", but everything else you've said, including the following paragraph, and your specification, indicates they can.
I've finally collected all my thoughts / concerns and have also summarized them in this document:

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Replay attacks make BIP148 and BIP149 untennable 
This is just me putting in my formal objection to BIP148 and BIP149 based on my experience with the ETH/ETC hard fork and involvement in that drama.
First, it's important to note that ETC/ETH HF is a very different situation from BIP148 and all other soft-forks. To those on this mailing list, the reasons should be self-evident (one results in two incompatible chains, the other doesn't).
However, replay attacks are common to both possibilities (i.e. when BIP148 has <51% hash power).
I believe the severity of replay attacks is going unvoiced and is not understood within the bitcoin community because of their lack of experience with them.
I further believe that replay attacks are the  issue with BIP148, BIP149, etc., superseding wipeout attacks in severity.
These are not baseless beliefs, they're born out of experience and I think anyone will reach the same conclusion upon study.
In a nutshell, replay attacks mean that all talk of there being potentially "two coins" as a result of BIP148 is basically nonsense.
Replay attacks effectively eliminate that possibility.
When users go to "sell their legacy coins", they've just sold their 148 coins, and vice versa.
Both of the coin-splitting techniques given so far by the proponents BIP148 are also untenable:
- Double-spending to self with nLockTime txns is insanely complicated, risky, not guaranteed to work, extremely time consuming, and would likely result in a massive increase in backlogged transactions and increased fees.
- Mixing with 148 coinbase txns destroys fungibility.
Without a coin, there is no real threat from BIP148. Without that threat, there is no point to BIP148, and the miners know this.
These and other concerns are outlined and explained in more detail in this conversation I had yesterday with John Light:

Maybe this is yet another example of a recurring criticism of Core: that core doesn't community these issues very well to journalists / reports / media / community outside of this list.
Because outside of this list it's been all about those 148 coins, and almost zero mention of replay attacks.

Point to this solved problem?
Your "solution" here is not a solution:
 Let's assume you invented a simple way to double-spend txns to self (which you haven't, fyi), then that is an issue in of itself as the point of bitcoin is to *prevent* double-spending to self.
There would need to be much more time for the community to discuss the implications of wallets have a "double-spend to self" button in them.
Yes it does destroy same-chain fungibility, as discussed on twitter [1], you're making miner coins special on both chains.
It effectively does. If people want to proceed blindly, ignoring replay, they're welcome to read about the consequences [2].

My understanding is that the two situations are quite different.
Unlike mixing to coin-split, CoinJoin doesn't create a high demand exclusively for coinbase transactions.
However, of the proposed methods, coin-mixing seems the better option, because it might be reasonably easy (I don't know) for exchanges to obtain 148 coinbase coins, and mix their coins with them, extending the coin-splitting capability beyond just miner coins and then using that to split incoming coins.
That seems like the most reasonable approach I've heard so far. Whether exchanges would be willing to do that is a separate question.
This method is time consuming and not guaranteed to work. CPFP can be used by an attacker to get your original txn into the 148 chain.
Why thank you aj, you're so good at spelling. :-)

In order to *get to that point*, you need >51%.
Not only that, but, if you started out with <51%, then you need >>51% in order to *catch up* and replace the large number of blocks added to the legacy chain in the mean time.
So, since >51% is _required_ for BIP148 to succeed (and likely >>51%)... you might as well do as SegWit did originally, or lower the threshold to 80% or something (as BIP91 does).
Without replay protection at the outset, BIP148, as far as I can tell, isn't a threat to miners.

See thread on replay attacks for why activating regardless of threshold is a bad idea [1].
BIP91 OTOH seems perfectly reasonable. 80% instead of 95% makes it more difficult for miners to hold together in opposition to Core. It gives Core more leverage in negotiations.
If they don't activate with 80%, Core can release another BIP to reduce it to 75%.
Each threshold reduction makes it both more likely to succeed, but also increases the likelihood of harm to the ecosystem.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Drivechain RfD -- Follow Up 
In Drivechain, 51% of miners have total control and ownership over all of the sidechain coins. The vision of Drivechain is to have many blockchains "plugged in" to the main chain.
Today, well over 51% of miners are under the jurisdiction of a single government.
Thus the effect of Drivechain appears to be the creation of a new kind of digital border imposed onto the network where everyone hands over ownership of their Bitcoins to a /single/ mining cartel when they wish to interact with /any/ sidechain.
Drivechain would be a reasonable idea if that weren't the case, but since it is, Drivechain now introduces a very real possible future where Bitcoins can be confiscated by the Chinese government in exactly the same manner that the Chinese government today confiscates financial assets in other financial networks within China.
One argument is that the psuedo-anonymity granted by Bitcoin addresses could theoretically make this less likely to happen, and while that is true, it is also true that every day Bitcoin becomes less and less psuedo-anonymous as governments invest in blockchain analysis tech [1].
How many high-profile confiscations ? now via the Bitcoin-blockchain itself (no longer being able to blame a 3rd-party exchange) ? is Bitcoin willing to tolerate and open itself up to?
In a world before Drivechain: the worst that a 51% coalition can do is prevent you from spending your coins (censorship).
In a world with Drivechain three things become true:
1. The Bitcoin network centralizes more, because more power (both financial power and power in terms of capability/control) is granted to miners. This is likely to have secondary consequences on the main-chain network as well (in terms of its price and ability to evolve).
2. A 51% coalition ? and/or the government behind it ? is now able to financially profit by confiscating coins. No longer is it just censorship, "asset forfeiture" ? theft ? becomes a real possibility for day-to-day Bitcoin users.
3. Drivechain limits user's existing choice when it comes to who is acting as custodian of their Bitcoins, from any trustworthy exchange, down to a single mining cartel under the control of a single set of laws.
The argument given to this is that a UASF could be initiated to wrest control away from this cartel. I do not believe this addresses the concern at all.
A UASF is a very big deal and extremely difficult to pull off correctly. Even when you have users behind you, it *requires* significant support from the miners themselves [2]. Therefore, I do not believe a UASF is a realistic possibility for recovery.
I would only support Drivechain if all of these issue were addressed.

Dear list,
In previous arguments over Drivechain (and Drivechain-like proposals) I promised that better scaling proposals ? that do not sacrifice Bitcoin's security ? would come along.
I planned to do a detailed writeup, but have decided to just send off this email with what I have, because I'm unlikely to have time to write up a detailed proposal.
The idea is very simple (and by no means novel*), and I'm sure others have mentioned either exactly it, or similar ideas (e.g. burning coins) before.
This is a generic sharding protocol for all blockchains, including Bitcoin.
Users simply say: "My coins on Chain A are going to be sent to Chain B".
Then they burn the coins on Chain A, and create a minting transaction on Chain B. The details of how to ensure that coins do not get lost needs to be worked out, but I'm fairly certain the folks on this list can figure out those details.
- Thin clients, nodes, and miners, can all very easily verify that said action took place, and therefore accept the "newly minted" coins on B as valid.
- Users client software now also knows where to look for the other coins (if for some reason it needs to).
This doesn't even need much modification to the Bitcoin protocol as most of the verification is done client-side.
It is fully decentralized, and there's no need to give our ownership of our coins to miners to get scale.
My sincere apologies if this has been brought up before (in which case, I would be very grateful for a link to the proposal).

Hi Paul,
I thought it was clear, but apparently you are getting stuck on the semantics of the word "burn".
The "burning" applies to the original coins you had.
When you transfer them back, you get newly minted coins, equivalent to the amount you "burned" on the chain you're transferring from ? as stated in the OP.
If you don't like the word "burn", pick another one.

Is that what passes for a technical argument these days? Sheesh.
Whereas in Drivechain users are forced to give up their coins to a single group for whatever sidechains they interact with, the generic sharding algo lets them (1) keep their coins, (2) trust whatever group they want to trust (the miners of the various sidechains).
Drivechain offers objectively worse security.

It would not change the number of Bitcoins in existence.

That is not correct.
There is a fixed amount of Bitcoin, as I said.
The only difference is what chain it is on.
It is precisely because there is a fixed amount that when you burn-to-withdraw you mint on another chain.
I will not respond to any more emails unless they?re from core developers. Gotta run.

# Blockchain Timestamps Unnecessary In Proof-of-Work?
*Author: Greg Slepak ([ at mastodon.social ]( ))*
The Bitcoin blockchain has a 10-minute target blocktime that is achieved by a difficulty adjustment algorithm.
I assert, or rather, pose the hypothesis, that the use of timestamps in Bitcoin's blockchain may be unnecessary, and that Bitcoin can operate with the same security guarantees without it (except as noted in [Risks and Mitigations]( and therefore does not need miners to maintain global clock synchronization.
The alternative difficulty adjustment algorithm would work according to the following principles:
- The incentive for miners is and always has been to maximize profit.
- The block reward algorithm is now modified to issue coins into perpetuity (no maximum). Any given block can issue _up to_ `X` number of coins per block.
- The number of coins issued per block is now tied directly to the difficulty of the block, and the concept of "epocs" or "block reward halving" is removed.
- The chain selection rule remains "chain with most proof of work"
- The difficulty can be modified by miners in an arbitrary direction (up or down), but is limited in magnitude by some maximum percentage (e.g. no more than 20% deviation from the previous block), we call this `Y%`.
 Observations
- Miners are free to mine blocks of whatever difficulty they choose, up to a maximum deviation
- The blockchain may at times produce blocks very quickly, and at other times produce blocks more slowly
- Powerful miners are incentivized to raise the difficulty to remove competitors (as is true today)
- Whether miners choose to produce blocks quickly or slowly is entirely up to them. If they produce blocks quickly, each block has a lower reward, but there are more of them. If they produce blocks slowly, each block has a higher reward, but there are fewer of them. So an equilibrium will be naturally reached to produce blocks at a rate that should minimize orphans.
A timestamp may still be included in blocks, but it no longer needs to be used for anything, or represent anything significant other than metadata about when the miner claims to have produced the block.
 Risks and Mitigations
Such a system may introduce risks that require further modification of the protocol to mitigate.
The most straightforward risk comes from the potential increase in total transaction throughput that such a change would introduce (these are the same concerns that exist with respect to raising the blocksize). The removal of timestamps would allow a cartel of miners to produce high-difficulty blocks at a fast rate, potentially resulting in additional centralization pressures not only on miners but also on full nodes who then would have greater difficulty keeping up with the additional bandwidth and storage demands.
Two equally straightforward mitigations exist to address this if we are given the liberty of modifying the protocol as we wish:
1. Introducing state checkpoints into the chain itself could make it possible for full nodes to skip verification of large sections of historical data when booting up.
2. A sharded protocol, where each shard uses a "sufficiently different" PoW algorithm, would create an exit for users should the primary blockchain become captured by a cartel providing poor quality-of-service.

Real quick (I've received some off-list replies and do plan to respond to those), want to be clear: this thread is not meant to be interpreted as a proposal to modify Bitcoin (it is not a BIP), it is just, exactly as the subject says, some thoughts I had that I hadn't seen expressed elsewhere, that I felt like sharing, in case they are at all useful/interesting to anyone.

So, this might not have been clear, but by "if we are given the liberty of modifying the protocol as we wish" I meant that I was discussing a protocol where these sorts of concerns are not an issue because we are not limited by the constraints of Bitcoin's current design.
There have been plenty of proposals across the web for how to design a blockchain where what you're referring to is not an issue because of merkle commitments, etc., and some blockchains already do this (e.g. I believe Ethereum does this via parity).

The DCS Triangle was independently discovered by myself and Trent McConaghy.
It is a useful tool for clearing confusion about blockchain scalability and blocksize-related debates.
The DCS Theorem is a probability proof of the triangle, and it's now on arXiv:
