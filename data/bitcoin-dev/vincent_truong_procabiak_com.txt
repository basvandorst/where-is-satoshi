@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP 9 style version bits for txns 
So I have been told more than once that the version announcement in blocks
is not a vote, but a signal for readiness, used in isSupermajority().
Basically, if soft forks (and hard forks) won't activate unless a certain %
of blocks have been flagged with the version up (or bit flipped when
versionbits go live) to signal their readiness, that is a vote against
implementation if they never follow up. I don't like this politically
correct speech because in reality it is a vote... But I'm not here to argue
about that... I would like to see if there are any thoughts on
extending/copying isSupermajority() for a new secondary/non-critical
function to also look for a similar BIP 9 style version bit in txns.
Apologies if already proposed, haven't heard of it anywhere.
If we are looking for a signal of readiness, it is unfair to wallet
developers and exchanges that they are unable to signal if they too are
ready for a change. As more users are going into use SPV or SPV-like
wallets, when a change occurs that makes them incompatible/in need of
upgrade we need to make sure they aren't going to break or introduce
security flaws for users.
If a majority of transactions have been sent are flagged ready, we know
that they're also good to go.
Would you implement the same versionbits for txn's version field, using 3
bits for versioning and 29 bits for flags? This indexing of every txn might
sound insane and computationally expensive for bitcoin Core to run, but if
it isn't critical to upgrade with soft forks, then it can be watched
outside the network by enthusiasts. I believe this is the most politically
correct way to get wallet devs and exchanges involved. (If it were me I
would absolutely try figure out a way to stick it in isSupermajority...)
Miners can watch for readiness flagged by wallets before they themselves
flag ready. We will have to trust miners to not jump the gun, but that's
the trade off.

I suppose whether the wallet devs want to implement the soft fork or not is
irrelevant. They only need to indicate if they are ready i.e. they've
tested the new soft fork, hard fork or feature and validated that it
doesn't break their nodes or wallet software.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Forget dormant UTXOs without confiscating bitcoin 
Dormant threshold is way too low. There's many news articles about people
forgetting that they used to mine bitcoins and then suddenly remembered.
This will continue to happen for much longer than 8 years as people
rediscover bitcoin when it goes further mainstream. You can't expect them
to have run a node/kept their utxo before they were aware of this change
and then realise miners have discarded their utxo. Oops?
Since we can't predict when mainstream will happen, you instead need a
threshold where the key holder is likely dead. That should be like 80 years
or 120 years, so 4.2m to 6.3m confirmations.
Next paragraph is off topic:
IMO it would be even better for these dormant & dead key holder's utxos to
also re-enter the economy as miner fees; let 1 dormant utxo to be mined per
block. It would need a hard fork. But then maybe people would stop being so
stupid with burning bitcoins/sending it to 1BitcoinEater, or mining a
million bitcoins from day 1 and leaving it, if they know it'll eventually
go into another miner's pockets. This could be used to fund cheap
transactions forever, and miners would be incentivised to hold copies of
these dormant utxos since it could become theirs one day. But this would be
even more controversial than just expiring them as we are in no short
supply of people who believe in Bitcoin's deflationary, fossil fuel
(burnable) economy, rather than a cyclical economy that better resembles
how we treat lost gold today...

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Bitcoin, Perceptions, and Expectations 
"Fast transactions"
Fast transactions implies it is slower than Visa, and Visa is 'instant' by
comparison from the spender's POV. Bitcoin is still very instant because
wallets still send notifications/pings when transactions are first seen,
not when it goes into a block. We shouldn't mislead people into thinking a
transaction literally takes 10 minutes to travel the globe.
Maybe this feels like PR speak. But being too humble about Bitcoin's
attributes isn't a good idea either.
If we're going to look at perception, image and expectations, perhaps we
can start to look at redefining some terminology too. Like confirmations,
which is an arbitrary concept. Where possible we should describe it with
finance terminology.
"0 conf transaction"
0 conf is the 'transaction' - just the act of making an exchange. It
doesn't imply safe and I believe using the word 'settle' in place of
confirmations will automatically click with merchants.
"1st conf"
A 'confirmation' is a 'settlement'. If it is 'settled', it implies final
(except by court order), whereas confirmation usually means 'ah, I've seen
it come through'. I rarely hear any sales clerk call credit card
transactions confirmed. More often you will hear 'approved' instead.
Although 1st conf can be overtaken, so...
"n confirmations"
This term can probably stay since I can't come up with a better word.
Settlements only happen once, putting a number next to it breaks the
meaning of the word. "Settled with 4 confirmations" seems pretty clear.
Alternatively I think instead of displaying a meaningless number we ought
to go by a percentage (the double spend improbability) and go by
'confidence'. "Settled with 92% confidence." Or we can pick an arbitrary
number like 6 and use 'settling...' and 'settled' when reached.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Max Block Size: Simple Voting Procedure 
Some changes:
Votes need to be 100%, not 50.01%. That way small miners have a fair
chance. A 50.01% vote means large miners call the shots.
Users (people who make transactions) need to vote. A vote by a miner
shouldn't count without user votes. Fee incentives should attract
legitimate votes from miners. A cheating miner will be defeated by another
miner who includes those votes, and take the fees.
This lets wallet providers and exchanges cast votes (few wallets will
implement prompts and will just auto vote, so if you don't agree, switch
wallets. Vote with your wallet).

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] User vote in blocksize through fees 
(Sorry for spam, forgot to cc the mailing list)
RE: miner economics
Miners who have an agenda can forego fees to achieve it and create their
own txns if it is completely txn/user driven. It is better to just count
miners votes and let the user votes be their backing.
Although miners need to include txns that have the same vote as them, or
you expect them be able to vote themselves with their own txns, with
backing eventually there will be a large pool of unconfirmed txns that vote
against them. Which means a juicy choice of fees for an honest or small
miner to vote the other way (if there are any).
If the votes are required to be near unanimous (almost 100%) rather than
majority rule, there will be a small miner out there who will vote honestly
and reset the vote on behalf of those users, because there is a fee
incentive to do so (a pure honest miner doesn't care about fees. But
they're a dying breed). If it is a majority rule type of vote, bigger
miners will set the vote direction and small miners have no say no matter
how they vote. From a decentralisation perspective, it is better to want
the big guns to have a small voice, otherwise it will tend towards
Troll users (voting against when the direction is very clear) can still be
ignored by excluding their txns unless they're paying attractive fees. (So
it isn't exactly 100%, but it'll be close). Miners have some power but
ultimately they will represent the users if the users votes are clearly
If you think 100% is hard, 95-90% could be a compromise but that requires
an assumption that at least 5-10% will have their voices unheard. And that
might be OK. Personally, 100% is consensus, anything less is just a
RE: vote bits
I think letting a vote go up and down in the same vote is a strange one.
Personally I think binary votes simplify the process.
Would it be better to 'announce' a vote that will contain a certain change.
For example, hash of a config file that said change MAX_BLOCK_SIZE -> 8mb.
More things can use the same mechanism by including changes in a config (or
whatever script/markup) file as needed in the future, for whichever
constants you want to expose to votes.
Votes can just be 0 and 1 for no/yes and omitted for neutral. My preference
is 1 for yes, 0 for no neutral/ignored and omitted for no, so that it is
backwards compatible and doesn't skew votes to the agreeing direction, and
forces node owners and wallet developers to upgrade and participate.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Use CPFP as consensus critical for Full-RBF 
(I haven't been following this development recently so apologies in advance
if I've made assumptions about RBF)
If you made CPFP consensus critical for all Full-RBF transactions, RBF
should be safer to use. I see RBF as a necessity for users to fix mistakes
(and not for transaction prioritisation), but we can't know for sure if
miners are playing with this policy fairly or not. It is hard to spot a
legitimate RBF and a malicious one, but if the recipient signs off on the
one they know about using CPFP, there should be no problems. This might
depend on the CPFP implementation, because you'll need a way for the
transaction to mark which output is a change address and which is a payment
to prevent the sender from signing off his own txns. (This might be bad for
privacy, but IMO a lot safer than allowing RBF double spending sprees... If
you value privacy then don't use RBF?) Or maybe let them sign it off but
make all outputs sign off somehow.
Copy/Paste from my reddit post:
Going to chime in my opinion: opt-in RBF eliminates the trust required with
miners. You don't know if they're secretly running RBF right now anyway.
Whether Peter Todd invented this is irrelevant, it was going to happen
either way either with good intentions or with malice, so better to develop
this with good intentions.
Perhaps the solution to this problem is simple. Allow Full-RBF up to the
point where a recipient creates a CPFP transaction. Any transaction with
full RBF that hasn't been signed off with a CPFP cannot go into a block,
and this can become a consensus rule rather than local policy thanks to the
opt-in flags that's inside transactions.
and am just guessing it can be used this way. I'm not familiar with the
CPFP is needed so that merchants can bear the burden of fees (double
bandwidth costs aside, and frankly if RBF is allowed bandwidth is going to
increase regardless anyway). That's always the way I've being seeing its
purpose. And this makes RBF much safer to use by combining the two.

Would this alter the way txns will be prioritised in order to try to win?
You would always pick txns with the best BTCDD to maximize your chances of
being the block to build on.
I see this as potentially being a bad outcome for bitcoin's fungibility.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Hash of UTXO set as consensus-critical 
This way lets us protect from 51% overwrites for a whole year:
1. Hash utxo set as is today, H1, and store it in a block.
2. At the same time, store a copy of the utxo set for H1 on disk, D1
3. After 1 year, create D2, then wait for H2 (if a fork happens then
recreate D2 and see which wins)
4. The block with H2 must hash on top of H1
4. Blocks before H1 can be safely pruned by the network, only keeping D1
for reference/validation, plus blocks the node wants to keep (data/colored
5. After 1 year, repeat for H3.
7. D1 can also be dropped after a few days once D3 is up, since the H1
securing D1 would have been pruned with H3's usage of D2 by then.
This reduces the security model from 'always secure' to 'secure, as of last
year'. An attacker will need to have hidden hashing power to overwrite a
years worth of blocks. Which I think would be hard enough.
The attacker can also try to undo a freshly built Hn, but because we can
build Dn first and wait for Hn, the nodes should be expecting the same
hash. They also serve as automated checkpoints to prevent them from
overwriting all of it.

Current meeting time visualised globally.
I think I found a good compromise: if the US want to accommodate Asia and
willing to sacrifice preference, 23:00 to 00:00 UTC might work.
It isn't easy to grab everyone's preference and accommodate everyone, so
this might work in theory but people may not be free to show up. US should
be ok. UK can participate or catch some nice z. Asia will need a bit of
early bird time but it's not as crazy as 3am. AU also fits in there nicely.
A meeting like this once a month should be enough probably (say, do this on
the first week of the month, and run every other week on the main
schedule). But I don't know whether there are enough people in Asia/AU to
make it worth it. Asia/AU people, thoughts?
