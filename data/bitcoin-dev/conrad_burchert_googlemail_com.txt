Some notes:
Hardforks like Bitcoin ABC without a malleability fix are very unlikely to
have payment channels, so the problem does not exist for those.
The designers of a hardfork which does have a malleability fix will
probably know about payment channels, so they can just build a replay
protection that allows the execution of old commitments. That needs some
kind of timestamping of commitments, which would have to be integrated in
the channel design. The easiest way would be to just write the time of
signing the commitment in the transaction and the replay protection accepts
old commitments, but rejects one's which were signed after the hardfork.
These timestamps can essentially be one bit (before or after a hardfork)
and if the replay protection in the hardfork only accepts old commitments
for something like a year, then it can be reused for more hardforks later
on. Maybe someone comes up with an interesting way of doing this without
using space.
Nevertheless hardforking while having channels open will always be a mess
as an open channel requires you to watch the blockchain. Anybody who is
just not aware of the hardfork or is updating his client a few days too
late, can get his money stolen by an old commitment transaction where he
forgets to retaliate on the new chain. As other's can likely figure out
your client version the risk of retaliation is not too big for an attacker.

As soon as there is competition for block space, people will likely
outsource creating the proof of work on the transaction to "transaction
miners". This would likely result in giving a fee to those transaction
miners. If those are the same miners as those mining the block, we are back
at the current system.
Put in other words: We are already doing this, you are paying the miner for
a piece of the proof of work of the block. If you want to mine instead of
paying, just mine a block and use a part of the block reward to pay the fee
for another transaction.
This also does not work to prevent spam. Instead of paying the transaction
fee you can just pay someone to mine proof-of-work on your spam
transactions, resulting in roughly the same cost. There is no reason a
normal user would be better in doing this than a spammer, likely it is the
other way around as the spammer is a more reliable customer for a miner.
