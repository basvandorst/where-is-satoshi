@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Suggestion to remove word from BIP39 English 
I would disagree here:
All that really would need to be done is select another word that is not on
the 2048 list, and then agree that by convention,  the words 'satoshi' or
the alternative word will represent the same number on the list. It seems
to be to be a fairly simple thing to implement.
