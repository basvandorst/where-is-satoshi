Maybe this site serves up exploits selectively?  I'm guessing most people are getting the 'domain for sale' but whoever is the target probably gets something special?

resolves to addresses announced by AS53665
Some basic info about AS53665 can be seen at They probably have a dedi or VPS at Cogent.  They didn't even create an IRR record for their AS or their only route.
Let's see what google has to say about malware from AS53665 (TL;DR - it's a malware site)

Maybe he has a fork on the real github.com and the link was a mistake.
I think it's possible that 'Kevin' is for real and maybe he doesn't realize he linked to a phishing site, if it was an accident.  If this is the same person, then he's blind, and maybe that's why he wrote 'U R L' instead of the usual 'URL', by using speech to text or some other assistive tech.  It might be that he tried to fork github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin and just provided the wrong link.  But regardless, stay away from the one with two Bs in it.

Teredo is available by default on Microsoft systems and it's actually very common to see Teredo addresses as peers in torrents - this should work for bitcoin too, though I'm not sure if an app needs to set special flags to gain access to it.. there are probably some security settings around it.  In the US, AT&T/CenturyLink provide IPv6 by way of 6RD for DSL customers, Comcast has native IPv6 on residential (but not business) cable modems, and of course those who want to can always set up with a tunnel broker like Hurricane Electric - they even let you use your own IPv6 addresses.  IPv6 is great, but having an application running its own tunnels would not be a good way to leverage it.
Probably what's keeping a lot of them from being reachable is that most people just plug their CPE into a NAT router (without IPv6).  Teredo can help here though.
Putting an IPv6 checkbox in the settings with a link to an explanation might help with education and result in smarter operators who can make their nodes reachable.  A built in checker would be even better - something like a checklist showing red/green for different aspects of reachability (v4/teredo/v6).

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Warning message when running wallet in 
I think a warning like this is inappropriate.
There are many reasons to use an out of date operating system and high level applications like wallets need not concern themselves with the rest of the system.  Maybe the wallet can scan your browser cache and tell you to stop visiting somesite.com too?
It just sounds like some kind of behavior modification that's being discussed here.. not-so-subtly suggesting that users shell out money for a newer version of the operating system, just to use their bitcoin wallets in a 'blessed' configuration.  This actually sounds very similar to what happens with Apple iPhones.. they somehow manage to 'invalidate' the charging cables and accessories with every major software version.  One day an accessory is working fine, then after the update users get a behavior modification nag every time they use it, urging them to buy a new one.  Along these same lines, might as well put a warning about the registry keys needing to be cleaned, and maybe a 'shock the money' banner[1].
You guys all know how it works with financial software - there are many organizations using decades old software (and hardware) because they know its shortcomings, they've taken care of them in a way that works them, and they don't want to start all over just for the sake of having the newest version.

Mutual CHAP could work.  This is commonly done in PPP and iSCSI.  The idea is simply that both sides authenticate.  The server expects the client to provide a password, and the client expects the server to provide a (different) password.  If you masquerade as the server, you won't be able to authenticate because every client has a different password they expect from the server, so they won't do work for you. MITM on the server can capture the exchange but CHAP protects against replay.

It looks like it might be firewalled, probably just need to fix the ACL in EC2.

I got ~500 uncaught bounce notifications, so it seems like something broke.
