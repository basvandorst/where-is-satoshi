@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Off-chain transactions and miner fees 
Hello all,
one argument I often read on this mailing list is that it's essential to
reward miners with transaction fees at some point to secure the network.
Off-chain transactions, whether it's Lightning or something else,
potentially extract fees, which may otherwise be paid to miners, if the
transactions were actually on-chain.
In this context, wouldn't it be contradictory, maybe even harmful, to
aim for an environment, where some/many/most transactions are off-chain?
I have not yet seen this conflict addressed in the recent discussions.

weren't for the Lightning network. The base Bitcoin layer can't handle
the transaction throughout that Lightning can, so the Lightning fees
were never available to Bitcoin miners in the first place.
This is questionable to some degree:
While it's given that limited space inherently limits the number of
on-chain transactions, one could argue that the limited space could
result in significantly higher fees due to the competition.
Likewise, if we assume there were a higher/no limit, then it would also,
or especially, be favorable to pay miners, instead of
off-chain-serivce-provider X.
In both scenarios, with, or without capacity limit, it doesn't seem
favorable to move transactions off-chain.
