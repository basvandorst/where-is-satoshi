@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Dynamically Controlled Bitcoin Block Size Max Cap 
I'm no authority on the subject, but I don't understand why there is a max
block-size, other than anti-spam measures.
The only other reason I have heard for a max-block-size is to force people
into paying higher fees.
This seems like the wrong way to force fees.  If you want to force fees,
then do exactly that - make fees required, and set a minimum... don't force
people to pay fees by limiting transactions per second.  That's like
shooting yourself in the foot to get free surgery....

I agree with the simplicity of this approach and with removing the
reduction step... it's unlikely the block size would ever need to be
reduced, only increased with demand?
I like this solution better than either kicking the can, or raising the
block size based on chain height (another dynamic solution).

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] RE : Visualizations of Votes 
While I like the idea of voting on the block size debate...  Why is this
vote limited to miners only?
I would prefer to see a vote by owners/holders of bitcoin, not miners of
If miners with 10%+ hashrate are the only ones who get to vote... bitcoin
development is an oligarchy

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP 102 - kick the can down the road to 2MB 
I would prefer a dynamic solution that did not necessitate a second hard
fork down the road.
I propose doubling the block size every 100k blocks (~2 years)
block 400,000 = 2MB (2016)
block 500,000 = 4MB (2017)
block 600,000 = 8MB (2018)

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Block Size Increase 
Instead of raising the block size to another static number like 20MB, can
we raise it dynamically?
Make the max block size something like:
pow(2, nHeight/100000) * 1MB;  //double every ~2 years
