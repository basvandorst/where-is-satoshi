As I understand Github is not to be used for the high-level discussion
of a draft BIP so I will post my thoughts here (is this specified
somewhere? Can we specify this in BIP-0001?).
-   I have some concerns about the structure and the wording of this
    proposal. I think both the structure and the internal wording can be
    slimmed down and simplified
    -   I also believe the "history lessons" should be trimmed out,
        mentioned at best
    -   There's separate BIP for at least one of the code forks
-   BIP-001 specifies that BIP proposals should not be given a BIP
    number until after they have been spelled checked and approved by an
    editor. Greg Maxwell: was this followed?
-   What kind of proposal is this? Informational, Process or Standards
    track?
    -   I believe it should be Standards Track. Include the proposed
        upgrade path as a patch into core as a module that hard forks
        can use in the future. This will also give us some space to work
        through some of the complexities of forks in a definite way.
    -   Alternatively maybe we can split up this BIP into a Standards
        track and a separate Informational BIP?

Here?s a BIP. I wrote the BIP mostly to stir the pot on ideas of governance, but I?m moderately serious about it. This is set in Markdown for readability, but here?s the BIP-0001 Medawiki version:    Title: BIP Acceptance Process
  Author: Andy Chase
  Status: Draft
  Type: Process
  Created: 2015-08-31
The current process for accepting a BIP is not clearly defined. While
BIP-0001 defines the process for writing and submitting a Bitcoin
improvement proposal to the community it does not specify the precise
method for which BIPs are considered accepted or rejected.
This proposal sets up a method for determining BIP acceptance.
This BIP has two parts:
-   It sets up a process which a BIP goes through for comments
  and acceptance.
  -   The Process is:
      -   BIP Draft
      -   Submitted for comments (2 weeks)
      -   Waiting on opinion (two weeks)
      -   Accepted or Deferred
-   It sets up committees for reviewing comments and indicating
  acceptance under precise conditions.
  -   Committees are authorized groups that represent client authors,
      miners, merchants, and users (each as a segment). Each one must
      represent at least 1% stake in the Bitcoin ecosystem.
BIP acceptance is defined as at least 70% of the represented percentage
stake in 3 out of the 4 Bitcoin segments.
This document is placed into the public domain.
BIPs represent important improvements to Bitcoin infrastructure, and in
order to foster continued innovation, the BIP process must have clearly
defined stages and acceptance acknowledgement.
A committee system is used to organize the essential concerns of each
segment of the Bitcoin ecosystem. Although each segment may have many
different viewpoints on each BIP, in order to seek a decisive yes/no on
a BIP, a representational authoritative structure is sought. This
structure should be fluid, allowing people to move away from committees
that do not reflect their views and should be re-validated on each BIP
Each committee submits a declaration including their claim to represent
a certain percentage of the Bitcoin ecosystem in some way. Though
guidelines are given, it's up to each committee to prove their stake,
and it's up to the reader of the opinions to decide if a BIP was truly
accepted or rejected.
The author doesn't believe this is a problem because a BIP cannot be
forced on client authors, miners, merchants, or users. Ultimately this
BIP is a tool for determining whether a BIP is overwhelmingly accepted.
If one committee's validity claim becomes the factor that decides
whether the BIP will succeed or fail, this process simply didn't return
a clear answer and the BIP should be considered deferred.
-   **Submit for Comments.** The first BIP champion named in the
  proposal can call a "submit for comments" at any time by posting to
  the [Dev Mailing
  List]( )
  mailling with the BIP number and a statement that the champion
  intends to immediately submit the BIP for comments.
  -   The BIP must have been assigned BIP-number (i.e. been approved
      by the BIP editor) to be submitted for comments.
-   **Comments.**
  -   After a BIP has been submitted for comments, a two-week waiting
      period begins in which the community should transition from
      making suggestions about a proposal to publishing their opinions
      or concerns on the proposal.
-   **Reported Opinions.**
  -   After the waiting period has past, committees must submit a
      summary of the comments which they have received from their
      represented communities.
  -   The deadline for this opinion is four weeks after the BIP was
      submitted for comments.
  -   Committees cannot reverse their decision after the deadline, but
      at their request may flag their decision as "likely to change if
      another submit for comments is called". Committees can change
      their decision if a resubmit is called.
  -   Opinions must include:
      -   One of the following statements: "Intend to accept", "Intent
          to implement", "Decline to accept", "Intend to accept, but
          decline to implement".
      -   If rejected, the opinion must cite clear and specific
          reasons for rejecting including a checklist for what must
          happen or be change for their committee to accept
          the proposal.
      -   If accepted, the committee must list why they accepted the
          proposal and also include concerns they have or what about
          the BIP that, if things changed, would cause the committee
          to likely reverse their decision if another submit for
          comments was called.
-   **Accepted.**
  -   If at least 70% of the represented percentage stake in 3 out of
      4 segments accept a proposal, a BIP is considered accepted.
      -   If a committee fails to submit an opinion, consider the
          opinion "Decline to accept".
  -   The BIP cannot be substantially changed at this point, but can
      be replaced. Minor changes or clarifications are allowed but
      must be recorded in the document.
-   **Deferred.**
  -   The acceptance test above is not met, a BIP is sent back
      into suggestions.
  -   BIP can be modified and re-submitted for a comments no sooner
      than two months after the date of the previous submit for
      comments is called.
  -   A BIP is marked rejected after two failed submission attempts. A
      rejected BIP can still be modified and re-submitted.
**BIP Committees.**
-   BIP Committees are representational structures that represent
  critical segments of the Bitcoin ecosystem.
-   Each committee must prove and maintain a clear claim that they
  represent at least 1% of the Bitcoin ecosystem in some form.
  -   If an organization or community does not meet that requirement,
      it should conglomerate itself with other communities and
      organizations so that it does.
-   The segments that committees can be based around are:
  -   Bitcoin software
  -   Merchants/services/payment processors
  -   Mining operators
  -   User communities
-   A person may be represented by any number of segments, but a
  committee cannot re-use the same resource as another committee in
  the same segment.
-   **Committee Declarations.** At any point, a Committee Declaration
  can be posted.
-   This Declaration contain details about:
  -   The segment the Committee is representing
  -   Who the committee claim to represent and it's compositional
      makeup (if made up of multiple miner orgs, user orgs, companies,
      clients, etc).
  -   Proof of claim and minimum 1% stake via:
      -   Software: proof of ownership and user base (Min 1% of
          Bitcoin userbase)
      -   Merchant: proof of economic activity (Min 1% of Bitcoin
          economic activity)
      -   Mining: proof of work (Min 1% of Hashpower)
      -   For a user organization, auditable signatures qualifies for
          a valid committee (Min 1% of Bitcoin userbase)
  -   Who is running the committee, their names and roles
  -   How represented members can submit comments to the committee
  -   A code of conduct and code of ethics which the committee
      promises to abide by
-   A committee declaration is accepted if:
  -   The declaration includes all of the required elements
  -   The stake is considered valid
-   Committee validation is considered when considering the results of
  opinions submitted by committee on a BIP. A committee must have met
  the required stake percentage before a BIP is submitted for
  comments, and have maintained that stake until a valid opinion
  is submitted.
  -   Committees can dissolve at any time or submit a declaration at
      any time
  -   Declaration must have been submitted no later than the third day
      following a BIP's request for comments to be eligible for
      inclusion in a BIP
BIP Process Management Role
BIPs, Opinions, and Committee Declaration must be public at all times.
A BIP Process Manager should be chosen who is in charge of:
-   Declaring where and how BIPs, Opinions, and Committee Declaration
  should be posted and updated officially.
-   Maintaining the security and authenticity of BIPs, Opinions, and
  Committee Declarations
-   Publishing advisory documents about what kinds of proof of stakes
  are valid and what kinds should be rejected.
-   Naming a series of successors for the roles of the BIP Process
  Manager and BIP Editor (BIP-001) as needed.
Conditions for activation
In order for this process BIP to become active, it must succeed by its
own rules. At least a 4% sample of the Bitcoin community must be
represented, with at least one committee in each segment included. Once
at least one committee has submitted a declaration, a request for
comments will be called and the process should be completed from there.

That's my goal: to take the hodgepodge of we already use for acceptance,
and apply rules that allow true acceptance to be identified in a clearer
If people don't follow the "rules" then the system simply won't work, this
is mentioned in the last section.

As posted:
**Enforcement/Organization** I agree with your comments. I don't believe in
setting up an organization to manage this process (would be too much power
and not really needed because the internet is pretty good at information
sharing). Therefore, I designed it around the assumption that participation
is voluntary. This means that it's hard to enforce rules like forcing
groups to see the other side. Groupthink/Echo chambers is real and is bad
but it's hard to change human nature.
In regards to enforcement, I believe that the best approach would be to
motivate committees to produce the best opinion they can (and also proof of
stake, another weak point in this proposal), as the better they can do this
the more likely the community will accept their opinion as valid and
Indeed, I believe that without an organization managing the process, it's
up to each individual reader of each BIP/Opinions set to make the decision
on whether or not there is clear and true community acceptance.
**Committee versus another approach**
Pros of using Committees:
* Committees are used today in many fields with a range of success. Lots of
previous work to work off of here, history is established.
* Many segments already have committee-like structures (Merchants produce
shared signed documents, miners often represent themselves, User groups
have representatives like voting on subreddit moderators, Core Devs have
Core Devs)
* Committees can filter a range of opinions down to a yes/no
* Committees have real people that can be talked to, contacted, etc.
* Much easier to proof stake in a range (People generally accept the
Bitcoin Core has 70-90% of the market share) vs someone trying to proof
they make up (.000001% of the Bitcoin user-base)
* Committees have some stability, encourages experience and expertise
(Committee members can be knowledgeable in their area and adequately
understand BIPs)
* Fear of committees working in the dark, censoring opinions (i.e. "Dark
smokey room of fat cats") (Possible solution: make committee power fluid
i.e. easily abandon-able: miners can change pools, users can change client
forks, change merchants, users can re-group, encourage transparency)
* More centralized, centralization of power (generally bad) (Possible
solution: encourage smaller committees)
* Centralization pressure (groups may seek to consolidate to gain power)
(Possible solution: Segmentation)
* Encourages groupthink, political maneuvers, turns good people into
politicians, mud-tossing
**Another possible approach: micro votes**
* Each user can represent themselves, no censorship
* People feel more involved and empowered
* How to prove and prevent manipulation?
* Only motivated people will contribute. Motivated people may be motivated
for bad reasons.

The 32Mb limit is here:
It's to keep the message size small enough that messages can be serialized
in memory.
Jeff if you decide to lift the 32MB limit (you really should, unless your
plan is to potentially hard force another Blocksize discussion again which
might be okay). I suggest having the 32MB ceiling auto-raise according to a
exponential factor (1.5?) starting 1 year from now.
Basically hard limit ceiling 2016-2017: 32 MB
Hard limit ceiling 2018+: 32*((currentYear-2018)*1.5) MB
The factor could be 2 like BIP-101 but I imagine you will want to be more
conservative. The delay time could also be longer if you think it will take
longer to fix the message size issue across all implementations.

Thanks for your thoughts.
My proposal isn't perfect for sure. There's likely much better ways to do
it. But to be clear what I'm trying to solve is basically this:
Who makes high-level Bitcoin decisions? Miners, client devs, merchants, or
users? Let's set up a system where everyone has a say and clear acceptance
can be reached.
My motivation for writing this proposal is stated right at the start:
BIP-0001 defines the process for writing and submitting a Bitcoin
Improvement Proposal to the community it does not specify the precise
method for which BIPs are considered accepted or rejected."
BIPs are considered "accepted" right now based on an undefined system,
quite honestly. Btc Drak: What's the system for accepting a BIP? Words like
"consensus" come up but they aren't defined. My goal is to define a system
that makes finding "consensus" (I like the word "acceptance" better) in a
clear and fair way.
I.e. what's broken?
* Being sure that a proposal is widely accepted or rejected
* Preventing deadlock (i.e. one person's weak objections preventing
* Receiving feedback from important segments like user groups,
merchants/exchanges, etc. in a systematic and clear way instead of going
and forth or having "oracles" on technical advisory boards.
Yes/No. Work gets done with the current process. Work can get done with
this process. The goal is for this process is to be safer/clearer/better
defined way.
As we move forward, we want to balance the powers in such a way that we may
want to pause a bit before we accept each proposal. 2 weeks for comments +
2 weeks for opinions will slow things down, but it shouldn't stall
meaningful work. I used 4 weeks for the process with the understanding that
most proposals are clear and easily acceptable. Controversial proposals
will likely need more time and thus will likely have be submitted at least
twice to discover a clear response.
"Accepting" a BIP means just that: It's accepted. What's acceptance mean?
This proposal provides an answer.
Client implementations, users, miners, and merchants can feel safe
implementing and using a feature that has clear acceptance. This process
isn't meant to force anything on client implementors, users, miners, or

I understand your concerns. What kinds of changes do you think should go
through a process like this? Just hard forks?
I was thinking that an advantage of making all BIPs use this process is
that it makes it familiar and well used. Kinda like a muscle grows stronger
with use. If only hard forks go through the process then there's the risk
that the process has to be spun up whenever they happen which might cause
Another reason I was thinking is that even small, local changes, it doesn't
hurt to have a few more people take a look at it and approve it.
The bureaucracy only applies to BIPs, not PRs. There's only been 18
approved/final/accepted BIPs in 4 years since BIP-0001. That's only about
~5 per year. I get that bureaucracy is often a waste of time, but I just
don't think every second counts for these things.

this proposal. I would welcome that.

Dang you are right Thomas! I'm just pretty excited about this proposal and
sparking a discussion on this issue.
Here's some updates and thoughts:
   - Luke said: "BIPs wouldn't be recognised as such because nobody cares
   to meet the higher requirements"
      - Possibly true, but maybe not! I think people like having a say
      especially people with a lot of money on the line or those who are really
      passionate about Bitcoin
      - One counter example, I emailed all the sponsors of the workshop
      conference about their stance in regards to scalability going into the
      workshop and I got a 47% response rate (with 21% responding with
a concrete
      answer). See here:
            - One example that agrees with you, I talked to the       community and they seemed very against participating in future
BIPs or even
      allowing discussion with people outside their community:
         - I'm seeking a historian or political science expert to assist me in
   this area. If you guys know any I'd be glad to talk to them about working
   with them.
   - Many people are complaining about the stake part, and are worried
   about the ambiguity. I firmly believe that proof of stake is a poor voting
   mechanism because it gives the most power to those that have a lot of
   money.
      - I think proof of stake might work for merchants to prove they have
      a decent economic stake if they sign with a well-known cold
wallet address,
      but I agree with someone that said merchants may be hesitant about doing
      that.

Mediawiki formatted documented:     Title: BIP Realistic Acceptance Process
    Author: Andy Chase     Status: Draft     Type: Process     Created: 2015-09-06
The current process for accepting a BIP is not clearly defined. While
BIP-0001 defines the process for writing and submitting a Bitcoin
improvement proposal to the community it does not specify the precise
method for which BIPs are considered accepted or rejected.
This proposal documents the current method for which BIPs are accepted
or rejected.
Due to the large number of BIPs and the different processes that were
followed, this BIP is specifically based around the acceptance process
of BIP-0064. This was picked because it picks up a lot of the edge cases
that BIPs often have.
The primary motivation of this document is to allow for a discussion on
a realistic and acceptable BIP acceptance procedure. There has been a
quite few calls for documenting and using the current "realistic" method
for BIP acceptance:

This game works best with at least 3 people and a basic familiarity with
the BIP process.
-   Story: You are a confident software superstar who has worked at
    Hooli and has taken up a passion for Bitcoin. You've realized that
    you need a specific protocol in Bitcoin core for an application you
    are working on. You've been funded a lot of money for this project
    so you don't really have any option but to try to put it into the
    core protocol.
-   Rules:
    -   Each turn counts as a day
    -   You can prevent anyone from taking a drink at any time by
        handing them a buck, looking into their eyes and saying "we are
        the future of Bitcoin"
    -   If you can't remember a word replace it with the word
        "consensus"
    -   If try to take a drink but are out, you must try to explain what
        a "fork" is to the person on your left in the most complicated
        way possible.
-   Start:
    -   Take a turn drawing up your implementation (draw a picture
        of something)
    -   Hand the "implementation" to the person on your left who writes
        down words explaining the picture in the abstract using
        big words. Hand it back. This is your BIP Draft.
        -   Roll die, number rolled is the number of required elements
            from BIP-0001 that you included in your BIP draft
            -   take a drink for each element you included
            -   If you rolled a 6 oops you didn't include a
                copyright declaration. Nothing happens.
    -   Submit for comments on mailing list
        -   For three turns, receive criticism. Each turn:
            -   Someone says your proposal is trash! take a drink and
                roll a die:
                -   If 1-2: Smash your hand on the table with your other
                    hand and take out the pain on the person to your
                    right who is criticizing your proposal. Take a drink
                    to ease the pain.
                -   If 3-4: Make an ad hominem statement about the
                    person on the right. Look them in the eye and take a
                    smug sip.
                -   If 5-6: Ignore it. Do nothing.
        -   Finish your drink if you get any positive remarks or
            constructive feedback about your BIP (in other words don't
            finish your drink).
    -   Submit draft pull request to bitcoin/bip.
        -   Story: Congrats! This represents an important milestone in
            the BIP process. You put in the effort to get the BIP draft
            vetted and you are ready to perform the janitorial task of
            publicly submitting your BIP into the official BIP repo for
            the world to see and refer to. The road ahead won't be easy,
            there's rules to obey and guidelines to follow. Think this
            will be quick and painless? Think again, a bit of short
            sidedness or a forgotten rebase will cost you time, and time
            is money.
        -   Setup (1 turn):
            -   Take a drink and roll a 6 sided die. Now self-assign a
                BIP number based on that. Say: "I'm not sure what the
                process is for picking a number, so I just grabbed one
                that's free." Take a drink if the number was taken.
            -   Flip coin. If tails take a drink and argue about
                following procedures: Say: "Seems like a timesink
                to me".
            -   Roll 6 sided die. If you get a 7, BIP editor reads your
                BIP and makes editorial suggestions.
            -   Flip a coin: If heads you will be asked to submit a
                change to the index readme as well. If so drown your
                misery by finishing your drink.
        -   Maintainence. Each day:
            -   Roll die. If 6:
                -   If you were asked to submit a change to the index
                    readme: flip a coin. If heads, your merge commit has
                    conflicts and you will be asked to rebase. If tails
                    continue:
                -   Did you receive any sort of comment in the last 2
                    days?
                    -   If so do nothing
                    -   If not, your BIP draft was merged! Celebrate!
                        Finish your drink.
            -   Flip coin. If heads take a drink as you received
                comments about implementation-level issues in the high
                level draft. Person to your right must say to you: "not
                a fixed size type? And why does the signed-ness not
                match the BIP?"
                -   You must now stealth fix issues in the background,
                    squashing history. Do not answer the question with
                    an explanation but instead remain positive. Say:
                    "Good catch, thanks!"
                -   Roll die. Take a stealth sip for each commit you
                    squashed
            -   Repeat until merged.
    -   Submit pull request with implementation
        -   Story: Amazing! Not only are you a brilliant writer and
            communicator, you happen to be a software engineer as well.
            Truely a the right combination of ethics and ethos in
            your genetics. Now you get to submit your change to see if
            it's a good fit for inclusion into Bitcoin core.
        -   Setup (1 turn)
            -   Flip a coin. If you get either heads or tails that means
                you didn't include any unit tests. Take a drink.
        -   Maintenance (3 turns):
            -   (1 turn) Peter found a DDoS vulnerability in your code.
                Take a drink of shame and say: "I don't think the attack
                you have in mind works."
            -   (1 turn) Someone says you haven't tested this patch
                enough yet. Take a test drink and say: "I attempted to
                write unit tests for this, but Core has no
                infrastructure for building test chains"
            -   (1 turn) Roll a dice. You can either take that many sips
                or insult the person on your right that many times. The
                person on your left may assist with the insults. Insults
                must be one of:
                -   "that would complicate the implementation
                    considerably"
                -   "You are welcome to implement such an upgrade in a
                    future patch, if you like"
                -   "You're making assumptions about the design without
                    understanding it."
                -   "Your second statement is nonsensical."
                -   "This patch is what it is. If you'd like it to be
                    better feel free to contribute code to make it so."
    -   Roll die. If 1-5 your patch was never merged. If 6 your patch
        was merged but then reverted. Finish your drink if
        this happened.
    -   Hard fork
        -   Story: Fantastic! You've gone through the BIP draft process
            and now its time to shift from the PR (pull request) process
            to the PR (public relations) process. You goal is now to
            convince everyone to join a client with your patch in it. If
            you get 70% (the economic supermajority) to join your patch
            you win the game. To signify they've joined your client,
            take their BIP document.
            -   You have to get 100% if you are playing with 5 or less
                people
        -   Setup (1 turn)
            -   Pick a reddit username. Flip a coin. If heads the person
                on your left makes up a name for you. If tails use your
                real name. Your profile picture is a strange picture you
                of a much younger age. Everyone must now refer to you by
                your reddit name prefixed but "u/" like so: "u slash
                sloppy lizard, it's your turn".
        -   Controversy (each day):
            -   Roll a die:
                -   If 1: Make a blog post about how your client is
                    the best. Make up a headline and say it. Everyone
                    must thumbs up or thumbs down. Those who thumbs down
                    must take a drink. Roll a die and that number from
                    the left looping around joins your client (only if
                    their thumb was up, you can join your own client).
                -   If 2: Announce a new community without censorship.
                    Anyone can finish their drink to censor this action.
                    If not censored, roll a die to see who joins (same
                    rules as 1)
                -   If 3: You make a silly beer joke on twitter. Take
                    a drink. No one joins.
                -   If 4: Point to the roof! Last one to point mined one
                    of your blocks and has to join your client. They
                    must also take a drink and say (begrudgingly): "to
                    the moon".
                -   If 5: Someone incites Fear, Uncertainty, & Doubt
                    about your client. Everyone is now scared of you.
                    First one to look you in the eyes has to join your
                    client and take a drink. Lasts only until your
                    next turn.
                -   If 6: Ask someone to join your client. They
                    must accept. Both take a drink of friendship.

Thanks for your response BTC Drak, I will attempt to summarize your
points and respond to them:
* Some BIPs are not consensus critical -- True, see my response to Luke
* BIPs do not imply usage -- This I covered in my paper.
* Acceptance can be defined by actual use -- That's one way of doing it
Wildly incorrect. My BIP had nothing to do with getting published. The
first words you can read in my proposal are as follows:
* but the proposal is "complete" when the proposer is happy with the final text.
This would be a cool inclusion. That is the intent of my "Submit for
comments" process.
Overall your post seemed to miss the point of my proposal, but that's
likely my fault for poor wording. I'm trying to develop a process of
coming to "consensus" i.e. gathering feedback and reducing opinions
down to a yes/no should this BIP happen or should we find a better
Importantly, it's not client specific. It's just a way of saying "hey
everyone, here's a problem and solution that a lot of people agree on"
or "hey everyone, here's a problem and solution that has a few
problems with it"
It's true that even if a "BIP" is "accepted" by my proposal it still
may not actually happen (this is mentioned in my proposal), and I
believe that's healthy. We can't force a change on anyone nor should
Since so many people are missing the actual problem I'm solving,
here's another way of wording it: A BIP is proposed and goes through
the process. A PR is submitted that matches the BIP perfectly, and is
submitted and vetted. Should wladimir merge it?
My process isn't perfect solution that would make it so we could
replace wladimir with a wladBot. But it's a tool we can use for
gathering meaningful information to help guide that decision. Waiting
on all objections to be handled works okay so far but won't work

What's some more information about the "memorizing and sharing" use
case? In most cases if you wanted someone to send you money you'd send
them a payment request via email (or just send them your address).
There's a bunch of solutions to your problem listed here:
But sending a payment request via BIP-70 is the "best practice":

Wanted to throw up here some feedback I got off-list. Source:

that's an important point. I've gotten that echoed from a few people
now. I was thinking that a re-submit could be called if more time is
needed but I think your method of allowing the author to have control
over the pace makes a lot of sense.
What does accepted mean? "Accepted" is the hardest thing to grasp in
this paper. There's just no way to force client authors, users, and
miners, to integrate and use a change, even if one is accepted by my
process. I.e. I'm trying to define what "accepted" even means, but
maybe I should use different words that don't have baggage. Like my
process could indicate "community greenlight" and client authors who
refuse to follow "community greenlight" can do so, but they are going
against the wishes of the community and that becomes obvious. Other
client others (like btcd) might follow the greenlight recommendation
instead and users are free to switch to that. Then there could also be
"community redlight", and "no decision reached" in which there was
conflicting views.
If I go this route, I could use the word "accepted" to mean something
like "appears in the longest fork", or "is in use by multiple clients,
merchants, & users" (for things like urls that aren't
How to prove stake?
"How groups prove their stake" is the hard question that has to be
addressed in this proposal or any. I've pushed forward several
recommendations but there's no perfect solution that everyone will
accept. For users, in the comments I suggested a "community sample"
method that requires that only a random few people in a group to give
up their privacy.
The "accepted" or "greenlit" standard in my proposal is defined as:
least 70% of the represented percentage stake in 3 out of the 4
Bitcoin segments. It's true that it seems weird to have 1 group in a
segment by itself (seems like too much power), you have to recall that
committees can consist of several groups that have agreed to act
together. If the 1 miner group had conflicts they'd separate to make
public both their views.
I'm interested in if you think that definition should be changed or if
you are worried about those risks.

Thanks for your comments Luke.
That's right. I want to be able to include more voices and be able to get a
clearer idea of acceptance then the process currently has available.
This process should work alongside the current one; not replace it.
*known to be* Is what I'm working towards; yes; but I think we need
additional tools/processes to determine that then what we currently have
it should be *determining* acceptance.
The committee determine acceptance when taking their opinions in aggregate.
The source of their indication might be similar to what we currently have
(esp for Core Devs, etc.)
The committee structures are fluid-- that is users are able to re-organize
at any time.
adopt a BIP that doesn't require consensus
This might happen, but is not a flaw in my process. My process makes it
clear they are going against the acceptance of the rest of the community. I
don't intend to "force" anyone to implement or use an accepted BIP. If that
is desired that's outside the scope of this BIP.
user base is a privacy violation.
I made a suggestion for this here:
If there are other ways for honest but anonymous voting mechanisms (that
aren't proof-of-stake since that's proof-of-most-money) I'd be all ears.
I agree these are flaws in the proposal. I'm not sure that one way of
indicating should be considered valid forever, but may have to change over
I think the process could be used to determine this.
I'm not sure what you mean here but would love more information.
