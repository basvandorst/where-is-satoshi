The term bit is really only overloaded for those who are techy. 95% of the

There's currently a set of rules which government what constitutes a valid

of fear that a major won't follow and they will waste hashing power.
If there was a rule supported by the majority that considered blocks with

One issue I do see is the protocol requires participants to check the
inputs submitted by others are valid. Lite clients (at least of the p2p
variety) cannot perform this check.
You could skip the verification part and if the inputs turn out to be
invalid then you'll find out when it doesn't confirm. This would problem
open the protocol up to dos attacks and prevent part of the "blame" phase
from working properly.
Alternatively you can have the participants submit the merkle proof for the
input. This would require inputs to have at least one confirmation, however.

Absent a concerted effort to move to something else other than 'bits', I
would be willing to bet the nomenclature moves in that direction anyway.
'Bits' is just a shorten word for 'millibits' (or microbits, if you
will). It's easier to say and my guess is people would tend to use it
naturally own their own. Kind of like 'bucks' for dollars.
The other synergies are:
-bit is part of the word Bitcoin. The currency unit bit is part of a
whole bitcoin.
-bit symbolically represents the tech nature of the bitcoin.
-bit used to be a unit of money way back when. This largely reclaims it.
-when used as money bit when in references to a precession metal coin.
The name 'bitcoin' references that as well as the mimicking of the gold
standard in the protocol rules.
All around I don't think there is a better fit. I doubt people will get
confused by it. The context it's used in will distinguish it from other
uses of the word.

The nonces cannot be derived from your wallet seed and, since they

a backup for that anyway. So we would end up having to back up all the

Of course it's easy to send the necessary data out of band as opposed to
OP_RETURN. The problem is if you do that the transaction cannot not be

wallets and avoiding the need to make regular wallet backups.
If users wishes to use stealth addresses with out of band communication,
the benefits of HD would largely be lost and they would be back to
making regular backups ? this time after /every/ transaction rather than
every 100.
There are only a couple options in such cases:
1) The user could send the payment to an addresses that is derived from
seed, but now you're using even /more/ storage space than you would by
just using OP_RETURN.
2) The user can backup after every transaction, which nobody wants to do.
3) The user could use some form of a cloud backup service and place
trust in them that their servers wont go down and lose their coins.
None of those options are really that appealing. OP_RETURN seems like
the best alternative to me, at least for that use case.

I agree but right now wallets not using stealth will only lose metadata,

Can you explain how the spv node fails against an attacker with a

need to Sybil them but also summon a massive amount of hashing power to
create a chain of headers (while forgoing the opportunity to mine valid

But could someone with that much hash power not Sybil a full node and give
them a chain for valid blocks (but on an orphan fork)? The failure model
doesn't seem specific to spv to me.

On Dec 18, 2015, at 10:30 AM, Pieter Wuille via bitcoin-dev There's that, but there's also a case where an attacker creates a majority chain that follows the old rules but not the new ones. Non-upgraded nodes would accept a transaction on what they believe to be the consensus chain only to find that when they try to spend those coins no one accepts them because they were part of an invalid chain.
This has the effect of dropping non upgraded nodes to a form of spv security without their consent.
This is in contrast to a hard fork where a full node operator could explicitly set their node to accept higher version blocks that it can't validate. They get the soft fork functionality back but they have at least consented to it rather than have it forced on them. Doing forks that way would also have the benefit of notifying the user they are accepting unvalidated coins, whereas they wont know that in a soft fork.

One of my biggest concerns is that these solutions (lightning network in

would be a bitcoin network using larger blocks. We don't exactly know
what the economies of scale are for pay hubs and could very well end up
with far fewer hubs than nodes at any conceivable block size.
Of course, it could also turn out to be fantastic, but it seems like an
enormous gamble to basically force everyone in the ecosystem to
collectively spend millions of dollars upgrading to Lightning /and then/
see whether it's actually an improvement in terms of decentralization.
To me, a much more sane approach would be to allow people to voluntarily
opt in to those other solutions after we've had an opportunity to
experiment with them and see how they actually function in practice, but
that can't happen if the network runs out of capacity first.

Thanks for doing some work on this Jonas. It's something I've been

As far as the use cases others mentioned, connecting and SPV wallet to
your full node is certainly one. It would make it easy to, say, connect
the android bitcoin-wallet to your own node. I've hacked on that wallet
to make it connect to my .onion node, but it's very slow border-line
unusable. Basic encryption and authentication would make that viable.
Also, while bloom filtering in bitcoinj is broken, it could be fixed by
just creating a single filter and filling it with 1000 addresses and
persisting it to disk. The main issue is you can't restore from seed
that way and would have to revert to what bitcoinj does now and blow
your privacy. If you had the ability to make an encrypted connection to
a trusted node just for restoring from seed, you could save your privacy
during a restore.

issues mainly come up when trying to get the filter to match both

As a Bitcoin user I find it abhorrent the way you are proposing to
intentionally cripple the chain and rules I want to use instead of just

I just want to point out what appears to be doublespeak going on here.
First, I think it would seem obvious to an observer that a sizable portion
of the community (certainly greater than 5%) view segwit as preventing
"rules I want to use instead of just peacefully splitting" but no
consideration was given to these people when designing segwit as a
softfork. I believe it was Luke who went as far as saying consensus does
not matter when it comes softforks.
Furthermore, when segwit was first introduced it kicked off a round of
softfork/hardfork debate which I participated in. The primary concern that
I and other raised was precisely what is going on now.. that miners could
unilaterally impose an unpopular change to the protocol rules.
At the time I told, rather forcefully, by multiple people that miners have
an "absolute right" to softfork in whatever rules they want. Which, of
course, is absurd on it's face.
But I don't see how people can make such claims on the one hand, and then
complain when this process is used against them.
It amounts to nothing more than "When it's rules I like we get to impose
them on non-consenting users. When it's rules I don't like it's an attack
on the network".
It was completely obvious this entire time that softforks were a very
slippery slope, now we are indeed sliding down that slope.
