Yes, I can see the turtles there.
Understood. :)  I would definitely like to see in Gitian any
improvements that make it easier for newcomers to get started.

The SPV node could connect to the IP using Tor.  It would preserve the
privacy of the SPV node - hard to see it's running Bitcoin.  It also
reduces the ability of an attacker to MITM because the routing varies
with each exit node.

BTW, I believe that the number of hops can be reduced below 3 on both
sides (client/server).  For Orchid, this will require a change to
CircuitPathChooser.  For other Tor implementations, it might require
using the control port to custom-build a circuit.

It would also be good to gossip the mapping of (IP -> onion address).
This would allow detection of a future MITM, since the MITM can't spoof
the onion fingerprint.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Multisign payment protocol? 
Interestingly, Blockchain's android wallet is based on Android Wallet /
bitcoinj.  So with HD in bitcoinj we would get Multibit, Android Wallet
(Andreas Schildbach's) and remove one roadblock to Blockchain going HD.
Electrum HD seems more or less ready.  So I'm optimistic that we'll see
a pretty fast transition to HD for the majority of the user base.
HD is important for some multisig flows, including the watchdog type
where you want to detect change going back to the wallet.
We have a proposed flow for watchdog type multisig
and a reference implementation off the Electrum 2.0 branch.
It actually works just like a regular spend from a UX point of view,
unless the watchdog decides that it needs a second factor for a risky
transaction.  With a risky transaction, the user just gets a
callback or enters an OTP.

Probably the most neutral way to go about this is to lexicographically
sort by encoded representation bytes.  In java, that would be

It would seem that threshold ECDSA with keys derived from separate seeds
has better security properties than one seed that is then split up.  The
main thing is that there is no single point of attack in the generation
or signing.

That's a good point. In the paper, they have a deterministic wallet
scheme in section 3.3.  It is non-interactive, so that's good.  On the
other hand, it's not BIP32, so that adds complexity.
Good points, although multisig is catching on quickly in the ecosystem.
AFAIK, all production wallets can send to p2sh addresses.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Securing hardware wallets 
I would like to solicit feedback on a whitepaper I wrote about securing
hardware wallets even if the hardware or software is compromised.  Let's
consider turning this into a BIP.
Abstract: With wide adoption hardware wallets present a very tempting
target. Once enough wealth is controlled by a specific hardware wallet
model, attacking the supply chain of the wallet becomes attractive.
Malware could be inserted in hardware or software. The random seed could
be generated in a way that is predictable to the attacker or the seed
could be leaked.
The paper describes a way for a "Warden" computer to manage a hardware
wallet in a way that protects the resulting private keys from

There are a couple of attack vectors to consider:
* The recipient's machine is compromised
* The sender's machine is compromised
BIP-70 and other ways of having the sender verify the destination on a
second device will help protect against sender compromise.  For a
person-to-person situation, you could verify the address by voice.
For the case where the recipient is compromised, you would want to
verify the address with the recipient's multisig security service.
Extending BIP-70 to allow multiple signatures would be one way to go
about this.  You would at least want to have a web page controlled by
the security service where you can verify addresses.

At CryptoCorp we recommend to our customers that they sort
lexicographically by the public key bytes of the leaf public keys.  i.e.
the same as BitPay.

I would also guess that the cost to provide service to SPV wallets is
less than $0.01/mo per wallet and in any case less than long-term
transaction fees.  This can either be taken up by the wallet author or
transparently through a payment channel by the user.

I'd like to offer that the best practice for the shared wallet use case
should be multi-device multi-sig.  The mobile has a key, the desktop has
a key and a third-party security oracle has a third key.  The oracle
would have different security thresholds for countersigning the mobile.
This way you can have the same overall wallet on all devices, but
different security profiles on different keys.
That said, I do agree that mnemonic phrases should be portable, and find
it unfortunate that the ecosystem is failing to standardize on phrase

Unfortunately there's more incompatibility than just the date issue:
* seed: some follow BIP39, and some roll their own
* HD structure: some follow BIP44, some BIP32 derivation, and some roll
their own
So actually very few wallets are seed-compatible, even ignoring the date
That's a reasonable solution.

You make some good points.  However, I still hope for standardization by
"profile".  E.g. a "consumer profile" for wallets with just one account,
a "business profile" for small business wallets.  If an application
falls outside of the standardized profiles, they can roll their own or
try to promote a new standard.
I think there are some important advantages to not being forced to use
the old wallet to send coins when switching wallets. The three I can
think of right now are: maintaining transaction history, emergency
transition when a wallet has a serious (e.g. money losing) bug and web
wallet with server down.
Another important reason to standardize is to reduce the "roll your own
crypto" temptation on the wallet creator part, where the wallet-specific
algorithm is more likely to contain weaknesses.
I do agree that trying to come up with one uber standard will likely
fail and is probably counter productive.

A good way to go about this from a UX point of view is warn the user
that their "phrase is non-standard", but allow them to insist.
 bytes thus allowing for complete and universal seed derivation without any reliance on word list. The word list is merely to generate a mnemonic, after that it has no role in seed generation so you can change it at anytime and it will never effect future mnemonics.

Telling the merchant who my security provider is not that different from
a privacy point of view from using their wifi.  In both cases they would
see us connect to the provider.  The connection / payload would be
encrypted of course.
In the mean time, we can un-multisig some of the coins for daily use, up
to a defined velocity limit.  (credit to Mike Hearn's for this idea)
Let's bring it closer.  p2sh.info shows an exponential increase,
currently at 8%.  At this rate, the majority of the coins will be
multisig near the end of the year.
