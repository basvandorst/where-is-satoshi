Hash: SHA512
I know this is a delayed reply.
Without intending to revive an older thread, my intentions are to clarify
what I have meant in my original post just in case anyone misinterprets where I said
"For example would be something like this:
If block = (empty OR  <%75 of mempool) THEN discard
This threshold just an example."
I should have clarified that with this idea blocks would not be rejected if does not match what that nodes have in their mempool, because as you have said,
there is no consensus on the contents of mempool and the mempool will vary from
node to node.
Instead what I have meant is that with this idea, nodes would only reject blocks if
they are empty or less than a determined percentage when compared to what is in mempool.
While this specific defense proposal I posted may or may not be a good idea, was only throwing this idea out there to create discussion on possible defenses against an empty
or near empty block attack.

Check out namecoin, there is also blockstack as someone mentioned, but I personally feel namecoin is technologically better.
If do not want a static bitcoin address mapped to a username, could use a stealth address (we need more
support for stealth addresses in bitcoin wallets).

Interesting, I just mentioned namecoin literally seconds before this email arrived.
Saying "it did not catch" is not accurate I'd say. It still works great, and namecoin
has actually made great progress this year 2017. I'd say that namecoin has great potential
but just not widely adopted yet.
Would be real nice to have namecion support in major bitcoin wallets for name to data mapping.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Single signature for all transactions in a block? 
Hash: SHA512
I had a question relating to scaling and privacy enhancements.
I believe that segwit combined with aggregated signatures
and coinjoin can potentially achieve such. The idea is to
use aggregated signatures in conjunction with coinjoin. So
that all inputs of a coinjoin transaction would have a single
signature vastly decreasing size while having privacy at the
same time. If majority of transactions in a block did this I
assume that significant more transactions could be fit into a
block? However the question I have, with the extra blockspace
made possible by segwit, is this extra blockspace limited to only
witness data or can it be used for transaction data such as the
scenario I have described here?

When the original white paper was written the idea was that nodes
would be miners at same time. That the distribution of mining power
being mostly on par with the distribution of nodes if I understand
correctly. The problem we face now I fear, is the mining power
becoming centralized. Even if every bitcoin node invested a $1000
into mining power and mined at a loss, it still would not even
make a dent in hash distribution. Currently there are around 6000
known nodes. If each node invested $1000 for say 10 ths of hashing
power. At current hashrate of around 3,674,473,142 GH/s this would
only make up %16 of hash power. This is out of balance as while
nodes are distributed mining power is becoming very centralized
due to the creation of monopolization of ASICs. The problem we
are facing is a small group of a couple people whom control a
large amount and growing of hash power. At time of this writing
it has quickly risen to 39% and at current rate will soon become
50% of hashing power that is controlled by a small group of a few
people. Their intentions are too hijack the bitcoin network to a
cryptocurrency that suits their dangerous agenda. Dangerous because
their plan would centralize power of consensus as I understand it,
to themselves the miners. Dangerous also because the code base of
the attempting subverters is buggy, insecure, and reckless from a
technological standpoint. Even though they only have very minute
amount of nodes compared to legitimate bitcion nodes, the danger
is that they are very quickly taking over in mining power. While
it is true that nodes will not accept invalid blocks that would be
attempted to be pushed by the conspirators, they are threatening to
attack the valid (or in their words, "minority chain") by dedicating
some mining power soley to attacking the valid chain by mining empty
blocks and orphaning the valid chain. So even though the majority
of nodes would be enforcing what blocks are valid and as a result
block the non-compliant longer chain, the conspiring miner can simply
(as they are currently threatening to) make the valid chain unuseable
by mining empty blocks.
If a malicious miner with half or majority control passes invalid
blocks, the worst case scenario is a hardfork coin split in which
the non-compliant chain becomes an alt. However the problem is that
this malicious miner is very recently threatening to not just simply
fork, but to kill the valid chain to force economic activity to the
adversary controlled chain. If we can simply defend against attacks
to the valid chain, we can prevent the valid chain from dying.
While empty or near empty blocks would generally be protected by
the incentive of miners to make money. The threat is there if the
malicious miner with majority control is willing to lose out on
these transaction fees and block reward if their intention is to
suppress it to force the majority onto their chain.
Proposal for potential solution Update nodes to ignore empty blocks,
so this way mined empty blocks cannot be used to DOS attack the
blockchain. But what about defense from say, blocks that are
not empty but intentionally only have a couple transactions
in it? Possible to have nodes not only ignore empty blocks,
but also blocks that are abnormally small compared to number of
valid transactions in mempool? For example would be something like this:
If block = (empty OR  <%75 of mempool) THEN discard
This threshold just an example.
What would be any potentials risks
and attacks resulting from both having such new rulesets and not
doing anything?
Lets assume that the first problem of blocking empty or near empty
blocks has been mitigated with the above proposed solution. How
likely and possible would it be for a malicious miner with lots of
mining power to orphan the chain after so many blocks even with
non empty blocks? Is there a need to mitigate this? If so is it possible?
Time is running short I fear. There needs to be discussion on various
attacks and how they can be guarded against along with various
other contingency plans.

According to current hashrate distribution tracking site coin.dance,
very likely within less than four weeks according to current hashrate
takeover rate.
While a fork is very likely, that I dont really fear because worst
case scenario is that bitcoin still survives and the invalid chain
becomes an alt.  My fear is the centralized mining power being used
to attack the valid chain with intentions on killing it. [1]
Shouldn't this 50% attack they are threatening be a concern? If it
is a concern, what options are on the table. If it is not a concern
please enlightent me as to why.

The attack quoted from his article:
    [Level 2] Anti-split protection??Miners will orphan the
    blocks of non-compliant miners prior to the first larger block
    to serve as a reminder to upgrade. Simply due to the possibility
    of having blocks orphaned, all miners would be motivated to
    begin signalling for larger blocks once support definitively
    passes 51%. If some miners hold out (e.g., they may not be
    paying attention regarding the upgrade), then they will begin
    to pay attention after losing approximately $15,000 of revenue
    due to an orphaned block.
    [Level 3] Anti-split protection??In the scenario where Levels
    1 and 2 protection fails to entice all non-compliant miners to
    upgrade, a small-block minority chain may emerge. To address the
    risk of coins being spent on this chain (replay risk), majority
    miners will deploy hash power as needed to ensure the minority
    chain includes only empty blocks after the forking point. This
    can easily be accomplished if the majority miners maintain a
    secret chain of empty blocks??built off their last empty
    block??publishing only as much of this chain as necessary
    to orphan any non-empty blocks produced on the minority chain.

You do realize that segwit includes many improvements of which are unrelated to scaling? These same improvements of which
simply increasing the blocksize alone would not fix or enable. Segwit is not just a blocksize increase.
Bitcoin Cash, while increasing the blocksize directly, from my understanding has yet to implement the
improvements and capabilities that segwit enables.
One example being, with transactions hashes being able to be calculated in advanced prior to signing
(due to the signature being in different section than that used
to calculate the transaction ID) it is possible to create transaction trees, enhanced smart contracts, trustless mixing protocols,
micropayment networks, etc...
Segwit also increases the security of signatures.
There are lots of other things segregated witness enables as well.
By saying "..segwit changes alone.... decided to also..." Bitcoin Cash has not implemented segwit. Bitcoin Cash only
increased the blocksize.
that wording above at least from the way I read it, seems to imply that Bitcoin Cash has segwit.

Pardon my unproffesional tone in my original comment.
But thank you for passing on these corrections. This looks much better.
I have a few comments that might lend to making this even more accurate or complete.
It is nice to see Bitcoin Cash use the proper ticket "BCH" and with
clarrification that segregated witness  was a softfork (backwards compatible
and optional to unupgraded nodes) instead of a hardfork. While segwit might
seem to compact more transactions to unupgraded nodes still using the 1 MB
blocksize limit (because signature data is stored outside of this legacy 1MB
limit), segwit is not actually more compact, but rather is a conservative blocksize
increase as a result of the new block space made available through segwit upgrade.
(One question I do have, which I am going to ask on the bitcoin-dev mailing list, is
"Is the increased blockspace made available through SegWit limited to just witness data?")
Segwit is not just about increased blockspace or transaction capactity though, but
also has more advantages as a result of seperating the signature into a different
segment. More information can be found here One advantage is with segwit seperating the signature data, advanced smart contracts and functions
on top of bitcoin can be used. This is due to transaction IDs being able to be calculated without
signatures, or before being signed.
Segwit also increases signature security, and if I am correct enables signatures algorithms to be
able to be upgraded via a softfork.
Segwit also enables Lightning Network. Lightning Network upgrade to Bitcoin enables instant and really
cheap transactions which can handle micropayments and massive scaling of throughput of transactions per second.
With micropayment networks such as Lightning Network, payments can be made off-chain, while still being enforced
by and settled on the Bitcoin blockchain. The Bitcoin blockchain would act as a settlement or dispute layer. As
a result this would also result in freed up space on the bitcoin blockchain as well.
The political reasons which differ from the "bitcoin cash" crowd, and the "bitcoin" crowd is the long term vision
of how to scale Bitcoin. The majority of the "bitcoin cash" crowd believes that scaling should be done by
simply raising the blocksize.
The majority of the "bitcoin" crowd, believes that increasing the blocksize to accomodate for all transactions like
what "bitcoin cash" is doing, would lead to dangerous centralization of whom would able to operate a Bitcoin node.
This is due to the factors of both storage, and bandwidth which are needed to sync and store the blockchain by nodes.
The Bitcoin Lightning Network:
Scalable Off-Chain Instant Payments
DRAFT Version 0.5.9.2
page 2-3 outlines a good description of why increasing the blocksize to accomodate every global transaction as a scaling
solution is not feasible.
In summary,
So while the majority of the bitcoin crowd see micropayment channels and micropayment networks on higher layers as the
next step in scaling for handling majority of transactions, the "bitcoin cash" supporters prefer to simply increase the
blocksize to handle all these transactions.
I plan on reading the rest of this paper to see if I have any other things to add.

(I am also forwarding this message to the bitcoin mailing list just in case there
are other technological errors that could use correction in this draft paper or
anything that should be added with my comments.)
To the authors of this paper,
I am commenting on Draft NISTIR 8202 Blockchain Technology Overview located at
Just in case that document is modified or removed I have also downloaded
it to redistribute this error ridden draft at a later point if neccesary,
and I also had the Internet Archive save a copy here for sake of archival reasons
to give context to this message.
There are a couple things I would like to contribute on regarding some
corrections needed in this paper. I must say, the content in this paper is
making me doubt the credibility of the NIST. I am starting to wonder if the
NIST is also incompetent with lack of credibility just like with most other
government institutions. Falsified information published as truth such as this
only expose their ignorance and incompetence and also propagate such ignorance
to other institutions and people whom rely on NIST for information or research.
The information presented in this paper is technologically invalid and contains
false information. I understand that mistakes happen, but this specific section
regarding "8.1.2 Bitcoin Cash (BCC)" is obviously written without prior research.
Even if research was done no citation is included to back these claims.
I ask you to please conduct research and validate information before publishing it,
especially when the credibility of the NIST is at stake.
I will proceed to outline some corrections.
1. Bitcoin Cash uses the ticker BCH, BCC is the ticker for BitConnectCoin
2. "When SegWit was activated, it caused a hard fork"
This is incorrect information. Segwit was not a hardfork. Rather segwit was
a softfork meaning that it is backwards compatible with unupgraded nodes and
miners. With it being a softfork it actually prevents a fork in the blockchain
by still being valid to unupgraded nodes and miners. Because segregated witness
is not a hardfork its use is optional.
3. "and all the mining nodes and users who did not want to change started
calling the original Bitcoin blockchain Bitcoin Cash (BCC)"
The original bitcoin blockchain is still called Bitcoin. Segwit did not create
any fork in the blockchain. Bitcoin Cash however was a hard fork that resulted
in a forked blockchain and new altcoin.
Bitcoin is Bitcoin,
Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin Cash.
4. "Technically, Bitcoin is a fork and Bitcoin Cash is the original
Technically, that statement is not truth.
Bitcoin Cash was forked from the original Bitcoin blockchain to create
the altcoin "Bitcoin Cash" (BCH) by people whom believe that the blocksize
should be large enough to accomodate all individual transactions on the main
chain. Without going into any of my personal opinions of which one is better
(bitcoin vs. "bitcoin cash") technically Bitcoin Cash was a hardfork and is
not the original chain but a forked one. It is a hardfork as the blocks
generated by BCH are incompatible with BTC nodes. Because of this lack of
backwards compatibility, and the resulting fork in blockchain is why BCH is
technically a hardfork.
This is just one section of this paper I have read thus far. It makes me
wonder how many other fallacies are throughout this paper. I also wonder how
many other NIST papers exist out of draft form that contain errors. Even
the smallest amount of research could have prevented this in the case of
this paper, unless you are intentionally pushing false information.
I hope these comments are of benefit to the improvement of this paper.

Thank you for your comments.
You, along with many others, expressed concern on section 8.1.2.
To help foster a full transparency approach on the editing of this section, I am sending the revised section to you for further comment. 8.1.2	Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
In 2017, Bitcoin users adopted an improvement proposal for Segregated Witness (known as SegWit, where transactions are split into two segments: transactional data, and signature data) through a soft fork. SegWit made it possible to store transactional data in a more compact form while maintaining backwards compatibility.  However, a group of users had different opinions on how Bitcoin should evolve ? and developed a hard fork of the Bitcoin blockchain titled Bitcoin Cash. Rather than implementing the SegWit changes, the developers of Bitcoin Cash decided to simply increase the blocksize. When the hard fork occurred, people had access to the same amount of coins on Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.

This is much better than the original. My question, the part where it says segwit makes transactions more compact, I thought that transactions are not more compact but rather they just take advantage of extra blockspace beyond that of 1 MB? Yes they would appear to be more compact to un-upgraded nodes due to the witness being stripped, but the transactions are not actually more compact right?
