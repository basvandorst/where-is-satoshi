@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP Number Request: Addresses over Audio 
If this is just encoding BIP-21 addresses, it is basically an "audio QR
code". In this case, does publishing it as a BIP still make sense? (Not
to imply that it doesn't, but it's something you should consider.)
Please look at existing implementations of audio modems when creating
your design. A lot of this work has been done many times before, so
there is a lot to learn from.
Your selected frequencies are harmonics of each other, meaning nonlinear
distortion will make detection more difficult. The Bell 202 and similar
modem standards chose AFSK frequencies to minimize interference.
Repeating a message multiple times is a very inefficient method of error
recovery. It works, but there may be better techniques, such as trellis
modulation or other convolutional codes.
Defining channel models to simulate your various use cases will help a
lot to determine if you have met your requirements.

P.S. I also briefly considered audio to exchange transactions with a
hardware wallet. Using GNU Radio made the implementation much easier.

I also agree with this - the user experience would be a lot better
without the need to install custom adapter software, especially for the
desktop case.
There could be two layers to the specification - the raw messages that
need to be passed, and the transport mechanism to pass them (USB HID, QR
code, audio...). For the most common case (USB), both layers could be
defined, and other transports could be added later. This split already
exists in the draft specification, though it's not very clear (URIs
include return URIs that don't make sense for a pipe, for example).
The existing URI scheme, while allowing disambiguate by manufacturer,
provides no way to to enumerate available manufacturers or enabled
wallets. This means that the "driver" would have to include a GUI to
select this. Also, passing return URIs seems rather fragile - are there
any other examples of protocols that use URIs for bidirectional IPC?

The proposed BIP only removes covert ASICBOOST. As long as the ASICs can
also do the non-covert ASICBOOST, it shouldn't have any impact on miner

It's actually the best thing to use an ASIC tightly coupled with DRAM
for - for example, HBM and HBM2 which reduce latency and increase
throughput by placing the DRAM on an interposer with the ASIC die, or
even putting the logic on the DRAM die itself.
It would need at least proof that existing chips using HBM are ideal for
Cuckoo Cycle (unlikely) and that no DRAM manufacturer could ever be
coaxed into making an ASIC (even harder to guarantee).
I think any long term PoW change is irrelevant to the review or adoption
of the covert ASICBOOST BIPs, given the many unresolved problems of such
a change.
