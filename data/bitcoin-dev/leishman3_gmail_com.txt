Interesting analysis! I think there are a few important effects that aren't
being considered.
1. When the block reward is halved, inflation is halved as well. Is this
halving already priced in by the market or will it result in an upward
pressure on the price?
2. It was acknowledged that the referenced analysis did not take into
account the result of a double-spend attack on the bitcoin price. However,
the effect of a detectable double-spend attack on the Bitcoin network is
not isolated to Bitcoin markets. The price of altcoins often trend with the
price of Bitcoin, so attacking Bitcoin may reduce the profitability of
'multipool' mining. Any alt-coin market vulnerable to the malicious
hash-power would probably go into panic mode.

Awesome! Haven?t had the chance to run it myself yet, so curious what benchmarks you are getting?

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Miner dilution attack on Bitcoin - is that 
Well miners already regularly mine empty blocks. However, it is usually in
the economic interest of the miners to collect transaction fees. This
incentive should hopefully be enough to prevent miners from choosing to
produce many empty blocks.
If a nation state attacker decides to allocate billions in resources to
attack Bitcoin, then that is a bigger discussion. The risk there is
double-spends, not empty blocks.

Hey Niels,
I'm no expert on bitcoind tests, but maybe these bits of information can
help you get started:
The steps to build bitcoind typically involve running:
make install
When you run autogen, the autoreconf
is invoked which creates the configure script that gets run next. The
configure script is generated based on the configure.ac
 file, which
performs a number of compatibility checks for the compiler and other
tooling. You can see these checks being performed with
the AX_CHECK_COMPILE_FLAG calls.
My understanding is that running configure does a lot of system
compatibility checks. When you run "make", I do not think any tests get run
by default, but I could be wrong about this. If you want to run unit tests
you need to run "make check". You can read more about this here
There are unit tests for bitcoind written in C++ and a lot of integration
and higher level tests written in python.
Hopefully this information was useful and accurate. Again, I could be wrong
about exactly how the build process works as it's not super obvious.
Hopefully someone else more knowledgeable than me can chime in here if I
got anything wrong.
