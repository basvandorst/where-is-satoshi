I have the same opinion.
On the other hand, I can imagine using compression on local blocks storage (be it compressed filesystem, or compression in the user space/in the application - compare with  Now that we support pruning and obfuscating, this could be another option. Saving ~20% can be interesting in some usecases.

Select your preferable compression library and google for it with +CVE.
E.g. in zlib:
?allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted compressed stream?
?allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash)?
Do you want to expose such lib to the potential attacker?

The newer versions contain much more accurate reporting of memorypool usage that reflect the real memory usage:
  "size": 58536,
  "bytes": 770044257,
  "usage": 1652554832

If this happens at all (the exchange rate of the coin can accomodate such expectation), the local fee market will develop, fees will raise and complement mined coins, thus bringing more miners back to the game (together with expected higher exchange rate).
