I believe the reasoning for this is stated in the Coin Type section.
"Public derivation is used so that cosigners need only know one of each
other's public keys, rather than needing to distribute public keys for each
BIP44 has a coin level, but it's a private derived level, so cosigners
would not be able to generate multiple crypto currencies of each others'
without giving each other n xpubs where n is the number of currencies
shared. This new proposal basically sticks coin type on the public
derivation side of things so that I could generate litecoin or darkcoin
multisigs without your permission...
This BIP seems like a good fit for multi-currency wallets based on
multisig. So kudos for putting it in writing.
However, I don't know if this is really a BIP thing. It's not improving
Bitcoin (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal... remember?), in fact, by definition
it is improving altcoin usability.
For that reason alone I will say I disagree for a BIP for this.

Hello All,
I have put together a proposal for a new generation methodology of HD
The method is a modification of BIP32, so if something is unclear or not
explicit, please assume it follows BIP32.
I am looking forward to any and all criticism and help with writing /

If this is deemed worthy enough to be drafted into a BIP, I would

would be.
Thank you, I will paste the link to the proposal below.

That is similar to an idea at FC15 (
 but instead of increasing
the number of keys needed up to m, and protecting against m-1 leaks. (so if
you have to give keys out to 10 departments you must store 11 keys, or 363
bytes, I have decided to leave it at 2 keys protecting 1 leak, and then
using convention to prevent calculating the master private key by requiring
all private keys AND all extended private keys (aka "nodes" in my proposal)
to be derived alone under their respective parents.
In theory this will prevent leakage of private keys from destroying the
entire HD wallet entirely.
Services like "Reality Keys" could be a perfect use case (he must release
private keys relating to the outcome, so he has decided against using BIP32
to generate addresses for the bets.
Any Cryptographers that would like to take a look at the math and see if
it's sound, I think I am properly breaking any linear relationships between
keys... but I would like a second opinion.
Thank you for your reply,

Hello Bob,
No, in fact I could give you any node (derived extended private key) or key
(derived normal bitcoin address private key) AND any node's extended public
key above them, and as long as the keys are generated within my
specifications, you can not derive the associated extended private key to
the ancestor extended public key.
If you think it still compromises the entire wallet, please show me in
pseudo code / explanation.
without your a,b?
I just added a Motivation section showing one example called Reality Keys.
They send bitcoins to Yes/No bet addresses and the result of the bet's
private key is revealed to award the winners via special P2SH scripts.
So they would need to give out "smaller" keys (aka normal private keys) and
it would be better to manage them hierarchically instead of just generating
millions of keys ahead of time and storing them on USBs or something.

Hello All,
I have updated the algorithm to include b in the derivation of a and vice
In the comment section of the gist, jhoenicke kindly pointed out that a
derivation was not including b at all, so colluding derivation was weak to
1 leaked descendant private node.
I am on my phone, but once I get home I will write out how to compromise
the parent private node with two child private nodes and the parent public
Hopefully writing that out will help give an understanding of any other
hidden tricks.
Sorry if a majority don't think BIP32 is a problem, but if anyone who has
interest could comment and double check the math, I would appreciate it.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] A BIP for partially-signed/not-signed raw transaction 
I have been seeing issues like the following many times on all the
different projects that support multisig with users responsible for partial
transaction transport.
I would like to gather opinions before proposing a BIP, (like whether we
need one or not) so please let me know what you think.
Basically, Electrum, Copay, Coinb.in, Bitcoin Core, etc. all have different
methodology for serializing partially signed multisig raw transactions, as
well as not-signed raw transactions regardless of scriptPubkey.
I think we should all be on the same page when serializing not-signed and
partially signed transactions so that the person could look at the data
alone and know what is necessary and how to manipulate it to sign and
complete the transaction.

Hey Thomas,
Just to clear the air, I am not OutCast3k, but I have submitted various PRs
to coinb.in under multiple handle names, and also Copay and Electrum. (You
could say I have multisig in my blood if you want to be cheesy)
I think I'm going to go ahead and draft up a BIP and submit it here just to
get the ball rolling.
Any ideas or input can be sent to me directly via email. I'll also start a
Telegram group chat  in case
anyone wants to join in on the discussion.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP 39: Add language identifier strings for 
This is very sad.
The number one problem in Japan with BIP39 seeds is with English words.
I have seen a 60 year old Japanese man writing down his phrase (because he
kept on failing recovery), and watched him write down "aneter" for
So instead I had him use Copay which generates Japanese words, wrote it
down 20x faster, and perfectly. Was able to recovery on the first try.
Imagine if I didn't tell him to try recovery before using it? (iirc Trezor
doesn't say to wipe and recover before using???)
If you understand English and can spell, you read a word, your brain
processes the word, and you can spell it on your own when writing down.
Not many Japanese people can do that, so they need to copy letter for
letter, taking a long time, and still messing up on occasion.
Even native English speakers who can't spell can mess it up badly too.
To be honest, a key storage format that doesn't support multiple languages
is much more dangerous than any doomsday situation you can think of for
supporting them.
BIP39 states that seed derivation is INDEPENDENT of wordlists, and that
failure to verify checksum (not knowing the wordlist falls under this)
should "WARN" the user and not fail, continuing to derive the seed anyways.
Currently the only wallet I know of following this part of the BIP is,
ironically Electrum. I can recover any BIP39 phrase from any wordlist even
if Electrum doesn't know it.
I really hope you reconsider multi-language support for everything moving
I understand it's a nightmare to plan for and support, which is fine if you
were just developing a piece of software sold by a company based in a
western country... but you are trying to make a standard for an
international currency. Defining "everyone should only use English, because
ASCII is easier to plan for" is not a good way to move forward as a
I am just thinking of all the users I will have to help out down the road
when they come crying to me saying they can't recover, and it turns out
they wrote down some non-English gibberish in roman characters claiming "I
wrote the English just as it was on the screen!" and I have to write a
brute force script to try all the word combinations for the mystery words.
(I have done this before)
Just my two cents. Not to be accusatory or anything.
Please reconsider. Thanks.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] PSBT global key for network 
Hi Jimmy,
The only time I could see this being a problem is in the case of a
Otherwise the likelihood that two unrelated networks could have a tx with
an id that is identical are low.
Everything included in PSBT thus far is info for verifying something
helpful, and providing the information needed for signing and verifying
what will be signed.
Adding a network section will be the inverse of that. The info doesn't help
you verify anything, since I could lie about the network, and you will need
to go out and check the network is as the PSBT says it is anyways.
Network is also not needed for signing.
In fact, come to think of it, even if there was a fork-coin incident, even
if you were able to separate PSBTs via network info, it won't matter if
there's no replay protection anyways, so giving a false sense of security
in thinking "I have explicitly stated my network so I should be ok"
(developers will think this, I guarantee) is actually a security minus IMO.
Currently BitcoinJS only uses network parameters to allow for the use of
addresses in addOutput... but I'm starting to think we should remove it...
not sure...
