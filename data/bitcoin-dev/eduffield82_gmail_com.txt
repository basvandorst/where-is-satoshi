I'm posting this here for visibility. Some researchers in Israel have
proposed a way to increase the transaction limit to 200 transactions per
second by implementing a new blockchain selection algorithm called GHOST.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Looking for GREAT C++ developer for exciting 
We?re a startup looking for 1 or 2 really good C++ programmer that is
familiar with the bitcoin internals to help with a for-profit startup.
We will be able to provide more information about the project after signing
a non-compete/non-disclosure agreement. Our coin will be one of the truly
unique coins that are not just a clone of the original Bitcoin code. In
short the project will be a merge-mined altcoin that will provide a very
useful service to the whole crypto-coin ecosystem.
If you have added any features to Bitcoin or related technologies this is a
definite bonus. Please include information about the work you?re done in
the space.
We have detailed plans on how to implement it and the roles we are looking
to fill. If interested please email eduffield82 at gmail.com with a
description of your work experience and we?ll vett the applications and
share our plans to see if you?re interested.
