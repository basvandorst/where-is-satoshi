@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Bravo Charlie One: Branding Bech32 
I here record for the devs a thought I had a few days ago on the Bitcoin Forum about BIP 173 Bech32 addresses.  I?ve heard Greg Maxwell say that ?Bech32 is designed for human use and basically nothing else?; so I hope I be not untoward in considering the following human-friendliness enhancement to entwine with the technical ambit of this list.  This MAY be suitable for mention in an informative specification, or informative section thereof.
To help gain user familiarity with and acceptance of the error-correcting, case-insensitive Bitcoin addresses of the future, I propose a need for what I think marketers call ?branding?.  The best branding is that which derives naturally from some intrinsic quality of a thing; wherefore I look to what may perhaps be a bit of serendipity in the specification.
I expect that in practical use, one of the great advantages of Bech32 addresses will be the relative ease of communicating them aloud?especially over the phone.  In similar circumstances, when trying to convey unusual names or pseudorandom strings, I?ve found radio alphabets to work well at their intended purpose.  And when reading Bech32 Bitcoin addresses in the most popular radio alphabet, they will always start with a catchy phrase:  ?Bravo Charlie One?.
That?s memorable, $SEARCH-able, and yet also one of those unique, otherwise meaningless phrases which gets marketers excited.  Keeping to a word triplet, I hereby submit for consideration as the official nickname for Bech32 Bitcoin use:  ?Bravo Charlie Addresses?.  These are the Bitcoin addresses with the magic words, suitable for a motto:  ?Bravo Charlie One means money.?  Add a logo ? la Segwit?s, and raise user awareness of this exciting new technology!
Beyond the branding issue, recommendations for Bitcoin spelling-alphabet use in English and other languages may perhaps be a suitable matter for such standardization as would facilitate coherent user documentation.  I invite discussion.
Of course, this branding only applies directly to Bitcoin Bech32 addresses.  The BIP 173 authors were gracious to make the standard generally adaptable; and it has already seen some uptake amongst altcoins.  I myself am now contemplating how Bech32 would be a superior human-facing format for key fingerprints for PGP, SSH, and even TLS, with HRPs of ?pgp?, ?ssh?, ?tls?, etc. and some appropriate means of embedding the key type just as ?bc? embeds the witness version.  There is an urgent general need for a specification which reduces the inherent pain of wetware in handling pseudorandom strings; and I do think that anything which familiarizes users with Bech32 in a specific use will be beneficial to Bech32 adoption generally.
To celebrate, as seen in my sig, I created for myself a new Bravo Charlie Address which expresses that I am pleased:  Now, I have an error-correcting, case-insensitive address which can receive only genuine Bitcoin cash money.  Because ?Bravo Charlie One means money.?
Here?s to the Bitcoin address format of the future!

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP 39: Add language identifier strings for wordlists 
I propose and request as an enhancement that the BIP 39 wordlist set should specify canonical native language strings to identify each wordlist, as well as short ASCII language codes.  At present, the languages are identified only by their names in English.
Strings properly vetted and recommended by native speakers should facilitate language identification in user interface options or menus.  Specification of language identifier strings would also promote interface consistency between implementations; this may be important if a user creates a mnemonic in Implementation A, then restores a wallet using that mnemonic in Implementation B.
As an independent implementer who does not know *all* these different languages, I monkey-pasted language-native strings from a popular wiki site.  I cannot guarantee that they be all accurate, sensible, or even Per the comment at  of the quoted file, I also know that for my short identifiers for Chinese, ?zh-CN? and ?zh-TW?, are imprecise at best?insofar as Hong Kong uses Traditional; and overseas Chinese may use either.  For differentiating the two Chinese writing variants, are there any appropriate standardized or customary short ASCII language IDs similar to ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 which are purely linguistic, and not fit to present-day political boundaries?
My general suggestion is that the specification of appropriate strings in bitcoin:bips/bip-0039/bip-0039-wordlists.md be made part of the process for accepting new wordlists.  My specific request is that such strings be ascertained for the wordlists already existing, preferably from the persons involved in the original pull requests therefor.
Should this proposal be ?concept ACKed? by appropriate parties, then I may open a pull request suggesting an appropriate format for specifying this information in the repository.  However, I will must needs leave the vetting of appropriate strings to native speakers or experts in the respective languages.
Prior references:  The wordlist additions at PRs   (Japanese);  (Spanish);  (Chinese, both variants);  (French);  (Italian);  (Korean);  (Indonesian, *proposed*, open).

You present some interesting ideas; and I will be much interested in the Github issue you referenced?thanks for that.  However, this discussion is *far* beyond the scope of my simple proposal and request to add standardized native language and short-ASCII identifier strings to the BIP repository.  I suggest that readers solely interested in the existing BIP 39 standard and its direct application to Bitcoin should stop reading right here.
That being said, I should briefly address some of the issues you raise (with further discussion best continued elsewhere):
I *strongly* urge the importance of language-specific standardized wordlists.  Even an individual who has secondarily acquired reasonable fluency in English will most likely have the least difficulty memorizing, transcribing, and otherwise handling a ?mother-tongue? mnemonic.  Such an advantage is important in applications whereby even slight errors can be fatal, and every bit counts.  This is to say nothing of persons who have limited or no English-language knowledge.
Yet for multiple reasons, multilanguage support is only feasible with standardization.  Wordlist creation is a highly specialized task.  Independent implementation of standards is imperative for avoiding implementation lock-in; and independent implementors (such as I) would be unable to create sets multi-language wordlists on their own, anyway.  For a view of the language-specific process involved in creating a wordlist, I invite everybody following this discussion to review BIP repository PRs   (Japanese);  (Spanish);  (Chinese, both variants);  (French);  (Italian);  (Korean, rejected); and  (Korean).  The rejection of  for Korean, and its superseding with  is particularly instructive.
With standardized wordlists, independent implementation is easy.  In my own implementation, the language switching backend (excluding the UI[1]) for multilingual mnemonic generation required only relatively small C code changes, as seen here[0]:
[0] [1] Admittedly, the multilingual requirements for seed generation will take a bit more; and my nonstandard, non-BIP39 ideas which require decoding words directly back to bits will take yet more.  But it is still not I only began writing this tool one week ago, as of today; and it has been a side project requiring small amounts of time, not a full-time dedicated task.  When I fully complete all aspects of seed generation, then users will have the option of another simple open-source tool which *will* be able to output a binary or BIP-32-formatted (?xprv?) 512-bit seed, given input of an existing mnemonic in any language supported by official BIP 39 wordlists.  Output can then be imported to any wallet software which supports BIP 32, regardless of the wallet?s langauge support (and whether or not the wallet supports BIP 39 at all).
**The ease of creating such tools squarely answers your concerns about vendor lock-in.**  And yes, it?s easy.  I can attest as a lone coder, it?s easy for me to create ?easyseed? as a side project!
Finally, aside:  In the discussion at SLIP repository issue  I see mention of m-of-n SSSS.  I have been mentally whiteboarding just such an application involving mnemonics.  Watch for it.    It is likely that I will crib the BIP 39 wordlists, given the impossibility that I could create my own set of wordlists in many languages.  I only wish that the BIP repository had support for more languages.  More!  Adding each new language to my implementation(s) will require approximately one-line code changes for me.
(Aside further:  Why is there not a Dutch wordlist?  I should like to add that, please?meneer Provoost.  More wordlists!)
Aside still yet further:  Should you be interested in more general applications of mnemonic phrases for pseudorandom strings, I think you will like this future feature which currently exists only as an Easter egg, (un)documented in my commit log:
Further discussion is invited by private mail, in an appropriate public venue, or otherwise not on a bitcoin-dev thread which makes a simple request and proposal as to the existing BIP 39 standard?thanks.

Well said.  Thank you for telling of these experiences.  Now please, let?s put the shoe on the other foot.
I ask everybody who wants an English-only mnemonic standard to entrust *their own money* to their abilities to very, very carefully write this down?then later, type it back in:
(Approximate translation:  ?Whatever would you do if Bitcoin had been invented by somebody named Satoshi Nakamoto??)
No, wait:  That is only a 12-word mnemonic.  We are probably talking about a Trezor; so now, hey you there, stake the backup of your life?s savings on your ability to handwrite *this*:
Ready to bet your money on *that* as a backup phrase in your own hands?  No?  Then please, stop demanding that others risk *their* money on the inverse case.
If you cheat here by having studied Japanese, then remember that many Japanese people know English and other European languages, too.  Then think of how much money would be lost by your non-Japanese-literate family and friends?if BIP 39 had only Japanese wordlists, and your folks needed to wrestle with the above phrases as their ?mnemonics?.
In such cases, the phrases cannot be called ?mnemonics? at all.  A ?mnemonic? implies aid to memory.  Gibberish in a wholly alien writing system is much worse even than transcribing pseudorandom hex strings.  The Japanese man in the quoted story, who wrote ?aneter? for ?amateur?, was not dealing with a *mnemonic*:  He was using the world?s most inefficient means of making cryptic bitstrings *less* userfriendly.
I began this thread with a quite simple request:  Is ????? an appropriate string for identifying the Japanese language to Japanese users?  And what of the other strings I posted for other languages?
I asked this as an implementer working on my own instance of the greatest guard against vendor lock-in and stale software:  Independent implementations.  ?  I asked, because obviously, I myself do not speak all these different languages; and I want to implement them all.  *All.*
Some replies have been interesting in their own right; but thus far, nobody has squarely addressed the substance of my question.
Most worrisome is that much of the discussion has veered into criticism of multi-language support.  I opened with a question about other languages, and I am getting replies which raise a hue and cry of ?English only!?
Though I am fluent and literate in English, I am uninterested in ever implementing any standard of this nature which is artificially restricted to English.  I am fortunate; for as of this moment, we have a standard called ?BIP 39? which has seven non-English wordlists, and four more pending in open pull requests (   I request discussion of language identification strings appropriate for use with that standard.
(P.S., I hope that my system did not mangle anything in the foregoing.  I have seen weird copypaste behaviour mess up decomposed characters.  I thought of this after I searched for and collected some visually fascinating phrases; so I tried to normalize these to NFC...  It should go without saying, easyseed output the Japanese perfectly!)

BIP 39 was designed to make brainwallets secure!  If a user generates a weakling 12-word mnemonic from 16 tiny octets of entropy drawn off the non-artistic /dev/urandom, then protects its seed with a creative passphrase haiku about the power of human stupidity, then the result will have a 128-bit security level.

It says, ?Bitcoin attests data existed?.  Within the scope of those three commands, I don?t see any proof of who put it there.  Does OTS check the PGP signatures on *commits* when it does that `git-extract`?  The signature on the v0.15.1 tag is irrelevant to that question; and FWIW, I don?t see *that* signature being verified here, either.  Second paragraph:  Moreover, with the breaking of SHA-1, it *may* be feasible for some scenario to play out involving two different PEMs with the same hash, but different public keys (and thus different corresponding private keys).  I don?t know off the top of my head if somewhere could be found to stash the magic bits; and the overall scenario would need to be a bit convoluted.  I think a malicious committer who lacked access to the signing key *may* be able to create a collision between the real certificate, and a certificate as for which he has the private key?then switch them, later.  Maybe.  I would not discount the possibility off-hand.  OTS would prove nothing, if he had the foresight to obtain timestamps proving that both certificates existed at the appropriate time (which they would need to anyway; it is not a post facto preimage attack).
Potential solutions using PGP:
0. Don?t use clearsigning.
1. Use a detached signature.
2. Use `gpg --verify -o -` and pipe that to `grep`, rather than illogically separating verification from use of data.  (By the way, where is the *hash* verified?  Was `grep` piped to `sha256sum -c`?)
3. Have shell scripts written by somebody who knows how to think about security, and/or who knows how to RTFM; quoting gpg(1):
4. Obtain an audit from Peter Todd.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Plausible Deniability (Re: Satoshilabs secret shared 
I despise the term ?plausible deniability?; and that?s really the wrong term to use in this discussion.
?Plausible deniability? is a transparent excuse for explaining away an indisputable fact which arouses suspicion?when you got some serious ?splain? to do.  This is usually used in the context of some pseudolegal argument about introducing ?reasonable doubt?, or even making ?probable cause? a wee bit less probable.
?Why yes, officer:  I was seen carrying an axe down the street near the site of an axe murder, at approximately the time of said axe murder.  But I do have a fireplace; so it is plausible that I was simply out gathering wood.?
I rather suspect the concept of ?plausible deniability? of having been invented by a detective or agent provocateur.  There are few concepts more useful for helping suspects shoot themselves in the foot, or frankly, for entrapping people.
One of the worst examples I have seen is in discussions of Monero, whereby I?ve seen proponents claim that even under the worst known active attacks, their mix scheme reduces transaction linking to a maximum of 20?40% probability.  ?That?s not good enough to convince a jury!?  No, but it is certainly adequate for investigators to identify you as a person of interest.  Then, your (mis)deeds can be subjected to powerful confirmation attacks based on other data; blockchains do not exist in isolation.  I usually stay out of such discussions; for I have no interest in helping the sorts of people whose greatest concern in life is what story to foist on a jury.
In the context of devices such as Trezor, what is needed is not ?plausible deniability?, but rather the ability to obviate any need to deny anything at all.  I must repeat, information does not exist in If you are publicly known to be deepy involved in Bitcoin, then nobody will believe that your one-and-only wallet contains only 0.01 BTC.  That?s not even ?plausible?.  But if you have overall privacy practices which leave nobody knowing or suspecting that you have any Bitcoin at all, then there is nothing to ?deny?; and should a Trezor with (supposedly) 0.01 BTC be found in your possession, that?s much better than ?plausible?.  It?s completely unremarkable.
Whereas if you are known or believed to own large amounts of BTC, a realistic bad guy?s response to your ?decoy? wallet could be, ?I don?t believe you; and it costs me nothing to keep beating you with rubber hose until you tell me the *real* password.?
It could be worse, too.  In a kidnapping scenario, the bad guys could say, ?I don?t believe you.  Hey, I also read Trezor?s website about ?plausible deniability?.  Now, I will maim your kid for life just to test whether you told me the *real* password.  And if you still don?t tell me the real password after you see that little Johnny can no longer walk, then I will kill him.?
The worst part is that you have no means of proving that you really *did* give the real password.  Indeed, it can be proved if you?re lying by finding a password which reveals a hidden wallet?but *you* have no means of affirmatively proving that you are telling the truth!  If the bad guys overestimated your riches (or if they?re in a bad mood), then little Johnny is dead either way.
In a legalistic scenario, if ?authorities? believe you have 1000 BTC and you only reveal a password for 0.01 BTC, the likely response will not be to let you go.  Rather, ?You will now sit in jail until you tell the *real* password.?  And again:  You have no means of proving that you did give the real password!
?Plausible deniability? schemes can backfire quite badly.
What about data obtained via the network?  I don?t *only* refer to dragnet surveillance.  See for but one e.g., Goldfelder, et al., ?When the cookie meets the blockchain:  Privacy risks of web payments via cryptocurrencies?   Your identity can be tied to your wallet all sorts of ways, any of which could be used to prove that you have more Bitcoin than you?re revealing.  Do you know what databases of cross-correlated analysis data customs agents have immediate access to nowadays?or will, tomorrow?  I don?t.
In the scenario under discussion, that may not immediately prove ?beyond a reasonable doubt? that you lied specifically about your Trezor.  But it could give plenty of cause to keep you locked up in a small room while your hard drive is examined for evidence that Trezor apps handled *addresses already known to be linked to you*.  Why even bother with bruteforce?  Low-hanging fruit abound.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Plausible Deniability (Re: Satoshilabs secret 
Preface:  As a longstanding policy, whenever I buy a new hard disk or decommission an old one, I immediately `dd` it from start to end with a pseudorandom byte stream.  The result is indistinguishable from my disk encryption setup, which leaves no apparent on-disk headers.  I don?t do this for ?plausibility? reasons, but rather, 0. to assure that immediately upon use, any sectors written with disk encryption cannot be distinguished from unwritten sectors, and 1. to make things overall more fun for potential cryptanalysts.  I do realize the small problem that I can?t affirmatively prove any particular disk in my possession to *not* contain decryptable data; and many of them don?t!
(I think that next, I may start writing my disks with headers for LUKS, which I do not use...)
Whereupon, I challenge plausible deniability designers to `dd` a 6TB disk with pseudorandom bytes, then try walking it across the U.S. border until it gets searched.  What could possibly go wrong?  Should you be ordered to decrypt it, the disk *could* be *plausibly* filled with pseudorandom bytes; and you would not be committing the crime of lying to an officer, when you truly state that in fact, it *is* filled with pseudorandom bytes.
Please, I want to see this ?plausible deniability? theory in action.  You owe it to your users to test the theory empirically, in circumstances in which users have here reported applying it.
Now, in reply:
On 2018-01-13 at 02:11:08 +0000, Damian Williamson Or PGP.  Or in a broader sense, Tor.  Or in the physical world, a high-security safe bolted to your floor.  Security systems attract attention.  Smart people develop appropriate threat models, keep their security systems confidential where it is practical to do so (don?t brag about your high-security safe), and work to increase the popularity of network security systems (PGP, HTTPS, Tor...) to reduce how much they stand out.
In the context of this discussion, it does help that Bitcoin is becoming popular.  It would help much more if Trezors and similar devices were as commonplace as iGadgets.  But when considering the potential threats to any specific individual, the only ?plausibility? shield is to not seem like someone who is likely to have *much*.  Of course, this is not a problem specific to Bitcoin.  Depending on the threat, the same danger applies to owning a substantial amount of gold, cash, or even money in a And therein lies the trick.  Unsophisticated adversaries such as common criminals may be fooled, or may not care if they can quickly grab *something* of value and run away.  But if your threat model may potentially include any adversaries possessed of both brains and patience, ?plausible deniability? solves nothing.  Such an adversary will not likely be satisfied with the standard of ?plausibility?.  More likely, the prevailing standard will be:  ?I wasn?t born yesterday, and I *know* that you are hiding something.?

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Proposal to reduce mining power bill 
Observation:  This totally destroys Bitcoin?s transaction-ordering security.  A ?51% attack? could be executed by any miner who has >50% of the hashpower *proportionate to miners who are allowed to mine a particular block*, rather than >50% of *global* hashpower.  (I infer that this could be done retroactively, and wave my hands over some of the details since you did not talk about reorgs.)  The same applies as for attacks requiring 33% or 25% of total hashpower.
Potential attack, assuming that N *must* be based partly or wholly on the existing set of ?next-coinbase? addresses:  A large miner could gradually push N higher, by progressively committing new ?next-coinbase? addresses which differ in the next bit for all previously seen combinations of bits.  Large miners would have a vast advantage over small miners, insofar as deliberately incrementing N by one more bit could only be done by a miner who creates 2^(N+1) blocks (= 2 * 2^N).  By such means, it may be possible for a very large miner to eventually lock out all other miners altogether, and monopolize all Bitcoin mining.
Now, questions:
How is N determined?  By a wave of the hands?
What part of which block hash is matched against N bits?  You were quite unclear about this, and other important details.  (Much of what I say here is based on assumptions and inferences necessary to fill in the How, exactly, are reorgs handled?
How does this interact with the difficulty adjustment algorithm?  Indeed, how is difficulty determined at all under your scheme?
What happens to coinbase fees from a ?new-miner-block??  The way I read your scheme, the ?new-miner-block? must necessarily have no payout whatsoever.  But you discuss only ?new bitcoins?, which are a diminishing portion of the block reward, and will eventually reach zero.  Coinbase from fees must go somewhere; but under your scheme, a ?new miner? has no payable address.
What if no existing ?next-coinbase? address matches?  Is N constrained to be sufficiently short that a match is guaranteed from the existing set, then that makes it trivial for large mining farms to collect addresses and further dominate (or even monopolize) the network in the attack described above.  If it isn?t, then the network could suddenly halt when nobody is allowed to mine the next block; and that would enable *this* attack:
What stops a malicious miner (including a ?new miner? creating a ?new-miner block?) from deliberately working to create a block with a hash which does not have N bits matching any of the existing ?next-coinbase? addresses?  Contra what you say, block hashes can?t be ?considered random?.  Indeed, partial preimage bruteforcing of block hashes is the entire basis of mining POW.
Asking here more generally than as for the attack described above, what stops mining farms with large hashpower from submitting many different ?next-coinbase? addresses in many different blocks?  If N be small, then it should be feasible for a large mining farm to eventually register a set of ?next-coinbase? addresses which match any N.  **This increases mining centralization.**  If N be large, then this creates the possibility (or raises the probability) that no address will match, and nobody will be allowed to mine the next block.
How could miner anonymity be preserved under a scheme whereby each ?next-coinbase? address can be linked to a previous ?next-coinbase? address?  The only way to start fresh would be with a prohibitively expensive no-payout block.  Mining can be totally anonymous at present, and must so remain.  Miners are only identified by certain information they choose to put in a block header, which they could choose to change or omit?or by IP address, which is trivially changed and is never a reliable identifier.
How does this even save electricity, when there is much mining equipment (especially on large mining farms) which cannot be easily shut down and restarted?  (Allegedly, this is one reason why some big miners occasionally mine empty blocks.)  Though I suppose that difficulty would drop by unspecified means.
Further observations:
This scheme drastically increases the upfront investment required for a new miner to start mining.  To mine even one new block all by oneself, without a pool, already requires a huge investment.  Add to that the uncompensated energy cost of mining that first block with *no* payout, and I expect that the bar would be prohibitive to almost all new entrants.  Mining costs and incentives are delicately balanced by the design of the network.  Whereas incumbents are much favoured by your scheme, further increasing miner centralization.  Large incumbents could also use this to produce a mining permissions market, by selling the private keys to committed ?next-coinbase? addresses.
I have not even tried to imagine what oddball attacks might be possible for any miner with sufficient hashpower to deliberately cause a small

On 2018-01-19 at 20:54:52 +0000, Jefferson Carpenter ?Moore?s law? is not a law of nature.  Indeed, chipmakers began bumping up against the limitations of *actual* natural laws about 15?20 years ago.  That is why instead of increasing core clock, they play the tricks which opened the way for Meltdown and Spectre.  Feature size, and thus transistor counts, will soon enough run into physical limitations, too.
But the scenario you describe does not even require such a discussion.
2^256 work for brute force is on the order of 10^77 hashes.  For the number of atoms in the observable universe, I?ve seen estimates ranging from 10^78 to 10^82.  Thus, you are suggesting that within 400 years, computers will be able to compute one hash for every myriad of atoms in the observable universe?perhaps one hash for every *ten* atoms.  Moreover, you suggest that twenty-fourth century computers will do this fast enough to meet Bitcoin?s ten-minute target rate.
Such a proposition bypasses science, leaps over science fiction, and lands in the realm of religion.  Perhaps a deity could do this?using a computer made of other than matter, powered by other than energy.  Humans will *never* be capable of such a feat:  Not now, and not in a billion years.  Certainly not a mere four centuries hence!
(I do not here positively exclude the possibility, however slim, that mathematical breakthroughs may yield a preimage attack on SHA-256 which is significantly better than bruteforce.  I *do* positively declare it impossible that Earth-beings will ever be capable of performing 2^256 work.  Or even 2^128 work, for that matter.)
