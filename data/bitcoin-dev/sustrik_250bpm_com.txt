Have it been considered to do this via IETF? The process there is hardened by 40 years of experience and 7000+ RFCs. Probably better than anything you can devise yourself.

Sorry, I haven't meant you personally. It was just a generic question about using existing process instead of inventing a new one on the go.

I wanted to have a look at how the whole Bitcoin thing works recently. Being a distributed application, I've searched for the protocol spec. What I found were two wiki pages (Protocol & ProtocolRules) that looked more like notes someone wrote down while implementing the application.
Have I missed something? Is there any effort underway trying to produce a decent spec? If not so, I am willing to help with that.

Imagine myself, with no prior knowledge of Bitcoin looking at the document. It starts with "Hashes". What hashes? No idea what's going on. Now compare that to a well written RFC. It starts with introduction, description of the problem, explains the conceptual model of the solution, then dives into the details. There's also Security Considerations part in every RFC that is pretty relevant for Bitcoin.
As I said, I am willing to help with writing such document, it would be a nice way of learning the stuff, however, help from core devs, such as answering question that may arise in the process, or reviewing the document would be needed.

In fact, yes.
In the end it boils down to saying something like: "Bitcoin is a unique global distributed application and thus all implementations MUST support the version of the protocol currently in use, irrespective of whether it have been documented and/or published. This RFC is meant only for informational purposes and is a snapshot of the protocol as to Oct 22nd That being said, I understand the idea of not publishing the spec so that everyone is forced to work with live data.
Heh. Haven't seen that one.

I would love to do so.
However, from what Peter Todd said above, my feeling was that spec is deliberately vague to force compatibility with the reference implementation rather than with a document.
While that kind of compatibility-via-obscurity won't probably work in a long run, in short run it can prevent proliferation of implementations and thus give protocol more space and flexibility to evolve (I've done the same trick with ZeroMQ myself once).
Anyway, if my impression was wrong I am happy to give it a try.

Does that imply that the notes are deliberately obscured to force everyone to check the source code?

That's a nice and concise way to put it and any potential protocol documentation should start with a statement like that.
One interesting question is whather alternative implementations are more likely to get it wrong because the protocol description is wrong or because the authors misunderstood the reference implementation source code.
Extensive documentation of the source code, a la Knuth's literate programming, may be some kind of a middle ground.
Ok. Several people expressed an interest in the topic, so I'll give it a try and see how it fares.
