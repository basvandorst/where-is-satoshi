@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] BIP 38 NFC normalisation issue 
I don't know for sure if the test vector is correct NFC form.  But for what
it's worth, the Pile of Poo character is pretty easily accessible on the
iPhone and Android keyboards, and in this string it's already in NFC form
(f09f92a9 in the test result).  I've certainly seen it in usernames around
the internet, and wouldn't be surprised to see it in passphrases entered on
smartphones, especially if the author of a BIP38-compatible app includes a
(possibly ill-advised) suggestion to have your passphrase "include special
I haven't seen the NULL character on any smartphone keyboards, though - I
assume the iOS and Android developers had the foresight to know how much
havoc that would wreak on systems assuming null-terminated strings.  It
seems unlikely that NULL would be in a real-world passphrase entered by a
sane user.
