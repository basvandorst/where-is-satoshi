I am surprised nothing like this exists already, so am all for the idea.
Maybe I am misunderstanding, but I'm not sure you want to have
thousand separators and other locale stuff in there. All currencies
including USD are often shown in Swedish using space or dot as
thousand separator and comma as decimal separator, e.g. "1.234,56 USD"
or "1 234,56 USD". I.e. this is something that the locale of the
user's environment defines, not something the server should have
opinions about. It is also not ideal to propose a given format based
on the user's locale, as some users have preferences for this (I
personally use US locale for numbers, and a US person who is visiting
Sweden wouldn't want this to suddenly change).

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Simple lock/unlock mechanism 
With the recent trend of physically robbing people for bitcoin (or
other cryptocurrencies), I thought it would be beneficial to introduce
a standard for locking up a portion of your bitcoin in a simple
'gotta-wait-awhile' system.
The idea is to simply create a transaction spending a set of UTXOs to
a P2SH address with an OP_CSV attached to it, and then throw away the
private keys.
To spend the bitcoin, you would have to broadcast the transaction and
wait the given amount of time, then use the new txout.
There are several ways to shoot yourself in the foot trying to do this
manually, but e.g. Bitcoin Core could handle this in a fairly
straightforward manner by introducing two new commands, which I call
freeze and unfreeze:
bitcoin-cli freeze [amount OR array of txid+vout objects] [days, default 1]
E.g. bitcoin-cli freeze 10 5
E.g. bitcoin-cli freeze ["abc123:1", "def346:0"] 3
The unfreeze command would by default list all freezes:
bitcoin-cli unfreeze
txid         days     status
bcd123   5           frozen
dca999   3           frozen
including the txid would broadcast the unfreeze and status would
become 'thawing' until the amount becomes available:
bitcoin-cli unfreeze bcd123
bitcoin-cli unfreeze
txid         days     status
bcd123   5           thawing
dca999   3           frozen
The benefit of this is that it becomes physically impossible for you
to spend the coins until you thaw them, and if this becomes standard
enough, it should disincentivize potential robbers as it would be
expected that you keep most of your assets locked up. They could of
course hold you hostage until the period is over, which may be worse,
but I think that kind of operation would be substantially more
difficult than a simply rob-and-run.
The drawback is that you have to broadcast a transaction in order to
spend the content, and you cannot bump the fee so the transaction
could get stuck in a high-fee situation.

A few p.s.'es:
1. Graftroot probably breaks this (someone could just sign the
time-locked output with a script that has no time-lock).
2. Address reuse of discarded privkeys would be a problem. A way to
alleviate might be that freezing includes a send to a new address and
the privkeys for that new one are discarded instead. One extra
transaction, but reduces the risk of accidentally throwing away
`donations4mybook` vanity keys.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Simple lock/unlock mechanism 
That kind of defeats the purpose. If you go through the trouble of
doing that, you can just do multisig and skip the freezing part
entirely. A robber would have to get you and the cosigner to sign in
both cases, and the CLTV could be overridden with graftroot.
1. Create TX1=(tx, sig) from UTXO A to p2sh B which has a CSV
timelock. Discard privkey A.
2. After broadcasting TX1, you need privkey B to spend it.
3. Use graftroot and privkey B with a script without timelock to spend B.
The robber can simply force you to execute step 3, since you have the
privkey to B.
That's a good point. Even more of a reason to include as part of
'freezing' a send to a new ephemeral key as 'initialization'. Sucks to
pay triple fees though (freeze ephemeral + unfreeze + actual use).
I was hoping there was a way for a person to simply lock-up the major
portion of their coins easily.
As a sidenote: a security firm (e.g. one that comes to your house when
the alarm goes off) could have a service where seeing an unfreeze
transaction which you have told them about without you giving a heads
up beforehand is equal to alarm going off.

I think I'm confused on this. To use graftroot it has to be a pubkey,
not a p2sh thing.

He can use pruning to only store the last X MB of the blockchain. It
will store the UTXO set though, which is a couple of GBs. In total, a
pruned node with pruning set to 1000 MB ends up using 4.5 GB
currently, but it varies slightly due to the # of UTXOs in existence.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Signet update 
Some progress (courtesy of ajtowns!) has been made on the Signet
proposal (BIP-325):
* Block signatures are now verified as transactions
Among other things, this means Signet is (probably) compatible with
PSBT (thanks sipa!), and no longer requires the custom "simple
signature verifier/creator" stuff.
This unfortunately means Signet will hard fork, but I don't think
anyone is using it seriously yet, so it shouldn't be an issue.
The BIP pull request is here: Feedback welcome.

Follow-up to this: there is now an alternative to this which proposes
that the rejection criteria in BIP 2 is updated to require there to be
an actual concern. This is here:
Please nod or something at either or both of them.

I am making a minor proposed change to BIP-0002
I propose that we change the 3-year-rule to allow anyone to change the
status of a BIP to "Deferred", rather than "Rejected".
Rejecting a BIP already has ambiguous meaning in BIP-0002 as it
stands, with "hard" rejects:
and "soft" rejects:
My proposal is that we disambiguate the second into "deferred" instead.
Alternatively, we add a new status e.g. "Inactive".
