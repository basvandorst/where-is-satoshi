@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Proposal: SPV Fee Discovery mechanism 
It would be 'completely predictable' for whoever knew the state and policies of a miner's mempool, but from an end user's perspective that wouldn't matter much: The end users wouldn't know if their transaction(s) would make the cut or not, somewhere in the network, and by what time. They (obviously) won't know what miners will find the next block(s), they won't know the miners' mempool sizes, potential custom eviction policies, etc.
I agree that this can be somewhat remedied by FSSRBF/CPFP, though, provided wallets give users a good (semi-automated?) interface for such transaction replacements/chains.
