Most Stratum pools already do multiple updates of the header every block bandwidth is really inconsequential, it's the latency that kills. At the time you are looking up to 15 seconds between the first and last pools to push
headers to their clients for the latest block. It's sort of inconsequential with
a 10 minute block time, but it cuts into a 1 minute one very heavily.
Some pools already don't do their own validation of blocks, but simply other pools, pushing them to be even more latency focused will just make this an
epidemic of invalidity rather than a solution.
You can't really use these as examples of things going just fine. None of these
networks see anything approaching the Bitcoin transaction volume and none have
even remotely the same network size. Some Bitcoin forks use floats in critical code and work "just fine", for the moment. We can't justify decisions with "but the altcoins are doing it".
Is there even a single study of the stale rates within these networks?

Same way ghash.io was banned from the network when used Finney attacks
against BetCoin Dice.
As Andreas Antonopoulos says, if any of the miners do anything bad, we
just ban them from mining. Any sort of attack like this only lasts 10
minutes as a result. Stop worrying so much.

If your end goal is "compete with VISA" you might as well just give up
and go home right now. There's lots of terrible proposals where people
try to demonstrate that so many hundred thousand transactions a second
are possible if we just make the block size 500GB. In the real world
with physical limits, you literally can not verify more than a few
thousand ECDSA signatures a second on a CPU core. The tradeoff taken
in Bitcoin is that the signatures are pretty small, but they are also
slow to verify on any sort of scale. There's no way competing with a
centralised entity using on-chain transactions is even a sane goal.

Are you really that pig headed that you are going to try and blow up the entire system just to get your way? A bunch of ignorant redditors do not make consensus, mercifully.
