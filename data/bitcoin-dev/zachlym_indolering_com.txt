@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP39 (mnemonic seeds) Unicode normalization 
I am working on a replacement for BIP39 and noticed that the password
section mandates a Unicode normalization pass but does not prohibit
unassigned character points.
I believe that this is problematic as newer drafts of Unicode alter the
output of normalization passes.  So if a user assigned a password using a
wallet that linked to Unicode 9 but input a code point reserved in Unicode
10, updating the wallet to Unicode 10 could incorrectly remap that code
point [0].
Thank you,

P.S. The relevant RFC on this subject specifies a different normalization
procedure [1]
