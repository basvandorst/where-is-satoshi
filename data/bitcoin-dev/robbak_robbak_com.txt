@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Roadmap to getting users onto SPV clients 
Hybrid SPV sounds like a good idea to me. Allows it to work out-of-the-box,
then slowly gets up-to-speed with the full network - working low priority,
or even not at all, if it detects a slow system or network link.
Another idea is always distributing the client with a checkpoint that is
only days old, then starting by pulling in more recent blocks, so it can
transact. Following that, it will pull in progressively older blocks as
time permits.

The obvious problem is that if you can frame it as a valid address, you can
put what you want there. If you can make it pass the validation, miners
have no way of knowing it's not a valid address.
Of course, there is nothing new about this. I ran strings on the blockchain
and found all sorts of ascii rubbish right from the beginning.

That sounds workable. I take it that the P2SH address is not stored? I like
it that this denies the possibility of storing data in the block chain, but
does not block interesting uses like creating date stamps - You can still
store the 'fake P2SH' value whose checksum is secured by the blockchain.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Service bits for pruned nodes 
While I like the idea of a client using a DHT blockchain or UTXO list, I
don't think that the reference client is the place for it. But it would
make for a very interesting experimental project!

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] 0.8.0rc1 status 
I have done test builds on FreeBSD.
Clean builds using gcc and clang, building both the qt gui and the command
line daemon, and the tests run clean as well. The qt gui runs, and cleanly
reindexed and caught up. I have no problems to report.
I am not doing any adjustments apart from applying the needed changes to
the include directory statements.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Proposal: MultiBit as default desktop 
But... Multibit is Java. Java's security problems has made it an instant
uninstall item on windows PCs for about a year now. Java exploits are a
dime a dozen.
Yes, you can reduce some of the problems by manually disabling the browser
plugin, but how many users will do that?
Recommending a fast SPV client as a first wallet - yes, of course.
Recommending users open such a huge attack interface on their computers by
installing Java - No go. Until Multibit is provided as a compiled binary
without a Java dependency, it is DOA.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Double Spend Notification 
Personally, I agree, but a different decision has been made by the main
The issue is this: consider two transactions in the unconfirmed pool. One
transaction has 2BTC input, 1.5BTC to one address (the payment), .4995 to
another address (change) and .0005 standard fee. Another transaction
appears - Same input, 1BTC to one address, .999 to another, and .001 fee.
Which one would a miner include? On pure self interest, the second one,
because it has twice the fee. Anyway, the miner has no real way of knowing
which transaction was real, and which the fraudulent double-spend. The
network does not keep accurate timestamps, so it has no way of really
knowing which is first. A bit of artificial DDOS-type overload on the
recipient's system, and the real transaction could easily appear last.
So the decision has been made to make 0-conf double spends trivial, so no
one will ever trust 0-confs. If a later transaction appears with a larger
fee, it will be considered to be the valid one, and the first one dropped,
as long as the first one has not been confirmed. This makes undoing a
mistaken transaction possible.
So anyone needing 0-conf-like speed will have to make other arangements,
such as contracting with enough mining pool power to never drop their
transactions unless confirmed multiple times. Secure 0-confs is an
impossible target with blockchain cyrpto-currencies as the stand. Any ideas
on how to make them work are welcome, of course - as long as we haven't
heard them too many times before.

That's good - what I had taken away from the replace-by-fee discussions was
that it was finally decided.
My opinion is that we should be doing what we can to make 0-confs as
reliable as possible - which will always be 'not very', but a solid system
to notify on attempted double-spends is a good start.
I'd like to know how Peter Todd's experiment with the 2BTC reward has gone.

Not at all - ACK from me, fwiw. Any attempt at a double spend should be
shouted from the housetops.
What Miners should do with that is still up for debate, it seems. My
opinion is that they should hold on and attempt to confirm the first,
letting it go only if a conflicting transaction is mined elsewhere. (Let
your Yes mean Yes...) But I understand the contrary arguments.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Tentitive port for FreeBSD 
Here is the link to the FreeBSD build system 'port' that I am planning to
get committed when 0.8.2 is released. Any comments appreciated.
The Makefile mostly just applies the users request for GIU/QR/UPNP. The
major change is using the external port for leveldb. The files directory
contains 5 patches - 2 that add boost-crypto to LIBS because we still need
that until boost is updated, one that patches the build to use that
external leveldb, and 2 minor fixes that are needed to build. I have got
branches ready for pullreqs on those minor fixes - I'll double check them
and make pullreqs this evening.
Again, any comments very welcome.
The files are available at
Robert Backhaus.
