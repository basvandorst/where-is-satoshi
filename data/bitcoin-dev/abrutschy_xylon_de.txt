@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Why are we bleeding nodes? 
Exactly. I stopped running a full node on both of my desktops machines
in the last month. Both systems were simply becoming very noticeable
(=unbearably) sluggish. I am also running dedicated nodes, which are
fine, but on a desktop latency is a major issue (or, let's say,  a
different issue than on a server).
I didn't notice any network latency, but that's hard to judge as our
internet is pants anyway.
PS: my machines aren't the newest, but still do a stellar job (without
bitcoind running ;)

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] "bits": Unit of account 
Agree - but why do you propose not only a new label but also a different
Also, everybody in the metric world is used to the milli- prefix due to
meters and millimeters. It's not such a stretch to expect people to
master that; but I agree that most people would struggle with microbitcoins.
There have been many proposals for more or less arbitrary subunits. What
would be the merit of your proposal? I don't really follow the reasoning
that it's better if it's uncommon for everyone rather than just uncommon
for people not used to metric units.
Regarding the label of a "bit": I have to agree with the others that bit
is heavily overused as a unit, but I am a computer scientist, so I don't
have the "average joe's" perspective on this. I find it weird to use as
it's already in use in English - "a bit of work" etc
I don't really see the advantage of a "bit" - it is part of "bitcoin"
and it's short, but that's about it. I think we are free to pick
anything we want for a label, so why not avoid ambiguities?
See this thread for many creative ideas for labels (and another
arbitrary subunit proposal:

I agree that overloading isn't an issue when necessary, but my point was
that the necessity is lacking. If we're free to pick anything, why pick
something that is overloaded?
Moreover, "bit" is an abbreviation of bitcoin and might be confused with
it. Most currencies use a work that is phonetically very different and
short, so why not do the same?
Pluk, or cred, or finney (as proposed the thread I posted), or
whichever. We could call it "unsp" for unspent ;)

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Significant losses by double-spending unconfirmed 
What are these pre- and post-Hearn-relay drop rules you are speaking
about? Can anybody shed some light on this? (I am aware of the
minrelaytxfee setting proposed in the 0.11.0 release notes, I just
don't see what this has to do with Mike Hearn, BitcoinXT, and whether
there's a code change related to this that I missed).
Related: is there somewhere a chart that plots `estimatefee` over
time? Would be interesting to see how the fee market evolved over
these past weeks.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Removing transaction data from blocks 
At DevCore London, Gavin mentioned the idea that we could get rid of sending full blocks. Instead, newly minted blocks would only be distributed as block headers plus all hashes of the transactions included in the block. The assumption would be that nodes have already the majority of these transactions in their mempool.
The advantages are clear: it's more efficient, as we would send transactions only once over the network, and it's fast as the resulting blocks would be small. Moreover, we would get rid of the blocksize limit for a long time.
Unfortunately, I am too ignorant of bitcoin core's internals to judge the changes required to make this happen. (I guess we'd require a new block format and a way to bulk-request missing transactions.)
However, I'm curious to hear what others with a better grasp of bitcoin core's internals have to say about it.
