@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Floating fees and SPV clients 
Hi all, first post so go easy on me!
Background/Intro: I'm a C/C++ software engineer with a keen interest in
Bitcoin working for everyone. I've spent the last couple of months pitching
Bitcoin to merchants & end users (previously I mined),
While I agree as Peter said, transparency with fees is good and leaving it
to the wallet designer to decide to either show / hide these (as Gavin
suggested) there is no denying that users hate fees/charges. That's why in
the UK so many online retailers offer free delivery (again perceived as a
zero value add charge). Infact, if you ask the average consumer, they only
have a mild inkling that there are fees paid by the merchants for using
credit cards.
So I'd agree with Gavin's proposed spec in an optional uint64 minfee which
senders(wallets) should deduct from the total paid to the receiver. If
however the sender is doing a dust collection txn (surely hugely unusual
for legit users?) then the sender should pay the additional costs. Does
that make "minfee" actually "minfeeperkb"? Perhaps, but wallets should aim
to not display such implementation details.
As a newb though, I have to ask, how does the receiver/requester/merchant
enforce these fee requests are respected?
