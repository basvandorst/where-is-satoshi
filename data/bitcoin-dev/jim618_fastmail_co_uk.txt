@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Roadmap to getting users onto SPV clients 
I think Alan's list of 'what should an ideal first client look like' is
right here.
relatively quickly but still have the safety of a deterministic wallet
then they should have a good first user experience. MultiBit is not
there yet, but BIP32 support is on the roadmap.
If we have a 'shopping list' of what we want in a first client then that
gives me (and others) a list of what to focus on implementing.
Also, as BIP32 support is added to clients and codebases then the actual
variant of software to use to access your wallet will become relatively
less important. Combined with a standardised seed -> passphrase
algorithm the user can just type in their long passphrase into any BIP32
compliant software and click/ buzz/ whirr : there is their wallet. We
should have a little logo for HD wallet compliance ! :-)
As Bitcoin's users become more varied there will be a spectrum of how
'involved' they want to be computationally so we should have offerings
to reflect this.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Random order for clients page 
I think we are all so familiar with Bitcoin that we forget how daunting
and confusing it all is to new users. The clients page does a good job
in explaining that there are various pieces of software that they (the
new user) can use with their bitcoins.
It also helps with the question "Who can I trust ?"
By having the clients on a link from the "mothership" of bitcoin.org it
gives credence to all of the alt clients.
This last point is a good reason to only include open source clients
IMHO. RE: The position randomisation - I have to admit I was secretly pleased
with the original layout, as MultiBit just happened to have the "eye
candy" position of "top and centre".  It is only fair to have them
switch around.

Hi Amir,
I am fine with the MultiBit description (+ subsequent suggestions like taking the language text out).
Looking forward to seeing it on the bitcoin.org site.

One approach you could use would be to use bitcoin signing on a list of the build artifacts together with their SHA256 hashes.
If you have a look at the MultiBit release notes you get the overall idea:
Currently these aren't machine readable but you can imagine
having a machine readable statement with:
+ a list of the files in the build
+ their SHA256 hashes
+ the above bitcoin signed by multiple signatures e.g. 2 of 3
The client can then download the file, check the signature,
check the hashes and knows which files to download.
The acceptable Bitcoin addresses for signatures would
be a whitelist in the client code.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Fees UI warning 
Yes I saw that on reddit too.
I think it applies mainly to custom transactions rather
than where fees are calculated automatically.
Another variant of not understanding change that loses
people's bitcoins I have encountered is:
1) Import a private key of a brainwallet/ paper wallet.
2) Send a small amount of bitcoin from that key.
3) The user then secure deletes all copies of the wallet
'for security'. If they are not careful they can delete
a change address with funds on it.
In MultiBit I have tried to reduce this possibility by:
1) Hiding the ability to delete wallet (in the next version
I am removing it entirely)
2) There is always a single key in a new wallet. When
a user imports a key then that makes two. I always send
the change to the second address, if it is available.
(This is bad for privacy but at least lessens the chances
that the funds become lost). If users are determined to use a brain wallet and secure delete every copy of the wallet after they use
them you cannot stop them (it is their machine after all)
But these two options help lessen the chance of bitcoin
loss if they do.
For the HD version of MultiBit we are removing the import
of individual private keys entirely and only supporting HD
addresses, primarily for safety reasons.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Proposal: MultiBit as default desktop 
Yes I would like to bundle a JVM as it would simplify the user
There are a few downsides though:
+ all the build packaging will need redoing and retesting.
+ it will bump up the MultiBit download from about 11MB to 30-40MB (I think). This drops the maximum copies of MultiBit the multibit.org server can deliver per day from around 90,000 to 30,000ish. The multibit.org server maxes out at 1 TB of bandwidth per day.
Currently there is no provision to update anything automatically.
I would like to start having Bitcoin signed files that MultiBit can
and update (initially the checkpoints file, I18N files - NOT code
at first because of the security implications). I think this needs to be in place before bundling a JVM so that users don't have to
keep redownloading it.
Having lists of all the artifacts signed and them having SHA256 hashes then makes it practical/ safe to start mirroring the code. I can see
each mirror crosschecking the others that the SHA256s are correct
for instance. This would increase the maximum number of downloads we could cope with.

Currently there are about 2,500 downloads a day for MultiBit.
There are download stats here:
With a mirror from Mike and perhaps another instance at
multibit.org that would get us to 100K per day so probably
nothing to worry about.
I think the highest daily download stats I have seen were in the
April 2013 'boom' where Bitcoin-QT downloads hit 30K per day as
I recall.
The 30-40 MB including a JVM is based on the download sizes for
CharlesProxy.com which does this for their Windows downloads.
The sizes are here:
This is a Java codebase too.
Yes there must be an auto-update framework (but without ECDSA signing most likely). I haven't spent much time on this

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Proposal: MultiBit as default desktop client 
Hello Everybody,
Over the last few months we have been steadily adding
functionality to MultiBit including:
+ encrypted wallets
+ sign and verify message
+ stability improvements and bug fixes.
As a result of these efforts I think MultiBit is now
suitable for the entry level Bitcoin user. I propose that we put MultiBit as the default desktop client on the bitcoin.org "Choose your wallet" page.
I think a typical new user comes to bitcoin.org from a google search or a Bitcoin news article. We want them to peruse the bitcoin.org site and try out a wallet. They should be able to get MultiBit up and running in a tea break. Then perhaps they get a colleague to send them some bitcoin from an Android phone by zapping a QR code. We say: "Welcome to the Bitcoin economy !"
There is plenty MultiBit cannot do of course. However if
in the first ten minutes we get the new user interested there is a good chance they will go on to explore other Bitcoin wallets and solutions. Let me know if you think this is a good idea (or not!)
and if you have any questions.

A few replies, in order of point raised:
Arguments against multibit default:
* Less testing, field experience on desktop
Yes this is true - downloads of multibit have typically been around
1/7th to 1/5th of bitcoin-QT downloads. It helps of course that
the bitcoinj networking/ object model is also used by Andreas as you note.
I think Mike has squashed the deadlocking problems with reentrant locks (primarily in the Wallet). I haven't seen one in at least a month.
We discussed proxy support on the bitcoinj mailing list a while ago and at the time the stumbling block was the Java library used for the networking (Netty) did not support it. Mike or Miron would know better than I if this is still the case.
Change address behaviour will improve significantly when HD
wallet support goes into multibit/ bitcoinj (I am hoping to get my
bit done over the summer). Matija Mazi has been working on a Java impl of HD wallets so it is coming down the pipe but
there is a lot to do yet.
Connections out from MultiBit are:
+ 4 bitcoind nodes on port 8333
+ multibit.org (188.138.113.201) for help, current version info
   (and probably more in future)
+ the currency ticker will make HTTP gets to the source of
   whichever exchange(s) you have set up e.g MtGox, CampBX.
   This calls should disappear if you switch the currency conversion
   and ticker off.
I think that is all the connections out I make.
Mainly due to the exchanges abruptly changing their APIs and
breaking things we are planning to put in intermediate "Exchange Data Provider" servers. Tim Molter is working on this
in his XChange project. That will enable us to patch the server
when things change and the multibits in the field won't be
affected. There will probably be a couple of these initially
for redundancy.
Alex: Yes I think most users migrate to blockchain.info or,
more recently coinbase.com. They are both good wallets
but I'd like to keep Bitcoin as P2P as possible.
I think you are right here on the number of full nodes versus
SPV nodes.
I don't think we even know yet what are the working ratios of
full nodes to SPV nodes. I haven't seen anybody do any analysis on this.
I doubt multibit will ever participate in the Bitcoin network other than as an SPV client. All the optimisation is to reduce
data traffic - it is effectively a mobile wallet that happens to
live on a desktop. It is not really intended to be more than
"a wallet for regular people to store and spend their bitcoin".
In English the nomenclature for direction of the transactions
is: "Sent to" and "Received with". To be honest I haven't transliterated the localisation files to check other
language packs but the localisers are pretty good in my

I missed Greg's point on confirmations.
It is definitely a challenge to explain/ visualize both:
+ has the transaction propagated the network ?
+ it it confirmed/ buried in a block ?
when those words probably don't mean much to
the intended audience.
The transaction status icons I *think* do it

It basically boils down to:
1) triangle or square : bad.
2) filling circle : good
3) tick mark : great.

Yeah "email jim' was never going to work so I have
bumped up MultiBit support (a bit) by:
+ having a dedicated Support page on the website
      It has fixes and support notes for the most common gotchas.
+ the in-app help also now has a 'Support' section with    "Troubleshooting' and the commonest gotchas.
   I've also written more help to cover as much as possible.
+ Failing that people are directed first to bitcoin.stackchange.com
   (I have a notification set up for the 'multibit' keyword.
+ Then finally users are directed to the github issues to search    existing or raise a new issue. Gary and Tim often chip in on there to
   close    issues down as well as me.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] BIP32 "wallet structure" in use? Remove 
Oh dear.
For reasons that are perfectly reasonable we are close to losing any chance of intra-client HD compatibility for BIP32 wallets.
In the next 12 months there will probably be collectively millions of users of our new wallets. I don't want them to suffer from vendor lockin.
Can we not agree on a lowest common denominator that we agree to support ?
An "HD Basic" if you like. For entry level users we can keep things simple and any "HD Basic" bitcoin will be fully interoperable.
Sure, if you use anything fancy you'll be locked in to a particular wallet but a lot of users just want somewhere safe to put their bitcoin, spend it and receive it.
I appreciate standising everything is very difficult (if not impossible) but if we don't have a minimum of interoperability I think we'll do our users a disservice.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] New BIP32 structure 
Good to hear the bip32 wallet structure is _so_ close to being standardised.
For MultiBit HD, we have put in support for 12/18/24 words but have the UI 'suggest' to use 12.
You can see this on the wallet creation wizard Gary recently blogged about:
There's a little combo for the seed length, with 12 as the default.
 You mention gaps. We are creating new addresses on the UI in a panel marked 'Request' where the user also types in a QR code label and a note to themselves. This gets stored away as a first class 'PaymentRequest'. The UI 'suggests' that each address is used once. There will be some gaps (where the payment request is never paid) but we aren't bulk creating addresses. I am hoping this shouldn't cause Electrum a problem.
We are also storing a timestamp (the number of days since the genesis block) to help wallet restore but that is SPV specific.
IP32 allows for a range of entropy sizes and it so happens that

The wallet words system isn't perfect for sure but it does help the user in two main ways:
1) Assuming wallet devs ensure forward compatibility for _their_ wallet the user knows they can recover their bitcoins using the same wallet software in case of a Bad Thing Happening.
2) To an imperfect degree, they can transfer/ recover their bitcoins that are stored in Wallet X into Wallet Y. We need to give them guidance on how to do this.
I think it is up to each wallet team to explain to their users clearly how they can do this in their help. It's only good manners to show your guests where the fire exits are.
It can be a simple help page saying:
"If you want to transfer your bitcoin out of MultiBit HD to Lighthouse, do this, this and this.
If you want to use the Trezor wallet you created in MultiBit HD on myTrezor.com, do this, this and this."
That way users have clear instructions on how to recover their bitcoins.
Users don't care about BIP this or BIP that but they REALLY DO CARE about keeping their bitcoins.
