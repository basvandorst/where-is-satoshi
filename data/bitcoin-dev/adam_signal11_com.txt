Maybe I'm not following the conversation very well, but if you have a small
hardware device that first displays a signed payment request (BIP70) and
then only will sign what is displayed, how can a MITM attacker do anything
other than deny service?  They'd have to get malware onto the signing
device, which is the vector that a simplified signing device is
specifically designed to mitigate.
TREZOR like devices with BIP70 support and third party cosigning services
are a solution I really like the sound of.  I suppose though that adding
BIP70 request signature validation and adding certificate revocation
support starts to balloon the scope of what is supposed to be a very simple
device though.
Regardless, I think a standard for passing partially signed transactions
around might make sense (maybe a future extension to BIP70), with attention
to both PC <-> small hardware devices and pushing stuff around on the
Internet.  It would be great if users had a choice of hardware signing
devices, local software and third-party cosigning services that would all
interoperate out of the box to enable easy multisig security, which in the
BTC world subsumes the goals of 2FA.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Proposal: Move Bitcoin Dev List to a 
Recent versions of mailman strip DKIM signatures, rewrite the envelope-from
to use an address at the list's domain and set reply-to to the original
authors address to resolve the DMARC issue.  I'm on several lists that do
this and it works just fine.
+1 on moving the list.  Given the fact that the mails are archived in
public, it's not really a huge deal how it takes place.  One month sounds
reasonable (although I think it could be done on a shorter timescale).  I'd
setup the new list to allow subscriptions, but keep it moderated to keep
discussion from moving until the cut, send lots of warnings and then on the
big day unmoderate one and moderate the other.
It's a great opportunity to hardfork something in Bitcoin without risk of
breakage, losses or entertaining melodrama. : )
ps. I think SF will let project admins download mbox archives of the list,
the new admins should be able to import them to keep archive consistency in
one place.

Hi Warren,
If you set dmarc_moderation_action to "Munge from", the list will detect
when someone posts from a domain that publishes a request for strict
signature checking for all mails originating from it (in DNS) and rewrite
the envelope-from to the list's address.  Reply-to will be added and set to
the original sender.
I think that this is probably a better way to workaround the issue (rather
than playing with getting the list to not break the signature) until these
things mature further.

It changes the mechanics at least.  A quick glance at RFC(2)822 makes it
clear that this is a pretty weakly specified behavior and is somewhat of an
edge case.  However, rewriting the envelopes has become somewhat prevalent
since strict DMARC has been adopted and I suspect that most recent MUAs
will handle it well.  I know that at least with gmail it works as I would
expect.  (Makes sense considering that this is how Google Groups handles
the problem.)
In any event, I really think it's worth a shot since having the subject and
footer tags is valuable. If it turns out to be problematic, it's not the
end of the world and things could be easily switched to go the lkml route...

Maybe you could forward my response to the list as an FYI?
