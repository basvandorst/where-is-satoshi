It seems so much easier to just allow bitcoin testnet to be used more widely for larger scale bitcoin staging. People can assign value as they wish to testnet bitcoins but at their own risk/peril. This incremental amount of value though would allow for testing of larger ideas, ideas that perhaps might not be appropriate in their nascent stages to apply for bitcoin. Have your seen 'proof of existence'? It's basically a bitcoin notary service that proves a document existed before it gets inserted into the blockchain. While a good idea- you could argue that it's blockchain spam as well- especially if one were to adapt it to high volumes in the future for notarizing permanently things like tweets (for example) or combining it with something like colored coins. These are great ideas, but maybe better suited to a proto bitcoin without needing to fashion a brand new coin. Sent from my iPhone

That is true, but someone is already running it as a service on the blockchain itself. See:
You can imagine similar  services cropping up for things like torrents, sending btc tweets, etc. While I am not saying these things are particularly refined ideas in and of themselves, people should have an opportunity to play with them, and better testnet. Sent from my iPhone

Why use ripple and not just use the testnet? The advantageous of allowing testnet to be used as an alt-coin are That Non standard transactions can be tested in a pseudo live environment where because the coins have some nominal value people are incentivized to try and steal and come up with clever ways of gamin the system. This sort of knowledge would be invaluable if non standard transactions are ever going to become a reality on main net. It also allows developers a chance to develop in advance new technologies and services that currently won't run on bitcoin main net but might be enabled in the future at which point they can switch over to main net. Additionally without any development happening with non standard transactions as currently there is no economic incentive , there might be a strong argument to never bother enabling non standard transactions as the risk of doing so might not justify in many people's minds  the benefits as if no one develops anything in advance  most users might not find the theoretical possibilities worth the risk, thus permanently hobbling the full potential of satoshis idea. Rather if testnet were allowed to act as an alt coin something cool might be developed that the main net users might desire enough to overcome the inertia of the status quo. Additionally it should be considered that the time in the future when non standard transactions might be enabled  might be so far in the future when bitcoin has hit mass adoption and changing anything might require far more political negotiations between users and devs then currently. Meaning that perhaps much more proof of functionality and value as well as testing might e required. Sent from my iPhone

Is there a relatively easy way to switch between Testnet versions in the
client? On the forums I am in discussion with one member who mentioned the
idea of a Main net, a testnet and a "beta-net" where the coins on the
beta-net would be allowed to have value. It seems like simple and logical
way to do this would be something like a "testnet=1, testnetversion=3" in
the bitcoin.conf file. Is this possible?
