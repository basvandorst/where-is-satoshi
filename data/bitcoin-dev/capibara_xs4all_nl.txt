@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] BitCoin and MinorFs/AppArmor 
A few years ago I wrote a least authority based set of filesystems named
MinorFs that worked closely together with AppArmor (suse/ubuntu) to give '
pseudo persistent processes' their own private but decomposable and
delegatable piece of filesystem storage:
Currently there is only one perfect fit for MinorFs and that's the stack
AppArmor/MinorFs/E-language-persistent-application. There are some close
fits like running ssh without a passphrase (
 )
but these require lots of manual fiddling by the user to get working. The
ssh trick would probably work with bitcoin, but as you can see from the
link above, it would be rather cumbersome.
I am trying to get specs together for rewriting MinorFs (in Python) in a
way that would make it easy and natural for application developers that
want their application to be able to protect user data (like bitcoin
wallets) from mallware running under the same uid as that user.
Currently minorfs granularity is hard fixed to that of the 'pseudo
persistent process', and that granularity is determined as described in
the following link:
When using pseudo persistent processes, you basically end up with
file-system storage that follows almost all of the modeling principles of
the object capability model. This is great when designing a least
authority program from scratch and writing it in the (object capability)
e-language using its persistence facilities.
Given however that I don't expect bitcoin, openssh, chrome, firefox, or
any other application that would benefit from what MinorFs provides to be
rewritten in E, it seems like the next version of MinorFs should give up
on the purity of its least authority model, and take an approach that
better suits common development languages and practices.
With bitcoin being a project that could benefit most from what MinorFs has
to offer, I would like to ask bitcoin developers to think about what
attributes from the current granularity level (pseudo persistent process)
should be kept, what attributes should be dropped, and what properties
should be added to arrive at an 'id' that is the best fit for granularity
of persistent private storage for bitcoin.
I really want to accommodate bitcoin developer needs in this, so all input
that helps me help you guys to get the next MinorFs version to accommodate
your needs to a level that code to use MinorFs where available can be
added to bitcoin, would be extremely welcome.
Let me know what you think,

I just finished the specs and design for MinorFs2.
I hope its a good fit for bitcoin this way.
I think 'process-Chain granularity' or 'Worker granularity' might be
suitable for bitcoin. But possibly a more course granularity level would
be required.
If there are any potential changes any of you could think of for these
specs and this design that would make bitcoin and MinorFs2 a better match
please let me know.

Given that there was not a single response to my post, I gather there is
no to little interest in an updated MinorFs that could be used by bitcoin
on systems that support AppArmor (Ubuntu and OpenSuse).
Nevertheless I've put down the initial set of specs for a rewrite of
MinorFs for if anyone would like to comment on them to make a future match
with Bitcoin more likely, I'm open to all sugestions:

I think the two could be considered complementary. Basicaly the existing
MinorFs provides to the pseudo-persistent-process that private members
provide to objects. 'Encapsulation of variables that still can be
delegated by the object that encapsulates them'. In the MinorFs2 that I
just started writing, I try to lower the barrier to using MinorFs by
providing facilities to do pick a granularity for 'object' more suitable
for most lines of development (where pseudo persistent processes are an
unnatural concept).
Think of BitCoin running as user certain user as an object and a piece of
malware running as the same user as a second object. You can than think of
the users home directory as a global variable, while MinorFs gives a
private home to both the bitcoin object and the malware object. The
bitcoin object can delegate parts of its private state to other objects,
but as long as bit-coin doesn't do that, the private state won't be
Its a good idea to have data on disk encrypted even if you use something
like Minorfs, if only to protect against bootable media attacks.
Basically the existing MinorFs will work already with the existing BitCoin
due to the fact that Bitcoin seems to extract $HOME from an environment
variable, but there are some caveats:
* It needs a bash script for starting up bitcoin with $HOME set to the
  MinorFs home.
* Bitcoin can be started in only one way. That is, bitcoin started from
the gnome menu is interpret being a completely differnt bitcoin than
bitcoin started from an xterm.
* There can only be one bitcoin started and running at once.
* All potential malware needs to run with at least an AppArmor profile
that keeps it from reading /proc/$PID for pids other than itself.
In the new version I'm contemplating, there would I think at least be a
minor change to bitcoin needed:
* bitcoin would have to use a small library that provides a
'minorfs_getpwuid' function.
This function will work like getpwuid on any system without an active
MinorFs2, and for any non apparmor confined process.
On a system with MinorFs running it should return a passwd structure with
the home changed to the MinorFs2 home.
All read and write operations will map directly to the underlying
file-system, so basically it comes with the same lack of guarantee that
file-system comes with once the underlying media becomes flaky.
Haven't really thought about that, what is considered the currently proper
way to keep backups for bitcoin?

I think its best. The old version I wrote in Perl using some rather rarely
used perl modules from cpan that don't have packages in either opensuse
nor ubuntu. I've moved most of my other new development projects to Python
or C++ for a long time, so Python has become much more natural for me to
work in, while migrating all perl module usage to a packaging compatible
set would also be a pretty large task.
learned from the existing MinorFs and do a rewrite in Python, making sure
all python modules used are available in both OpenSuse and ubuntu.
MinorFs IS basically a set of user space file-systems on top of current
UNIX/ACL permissions. Without further changes with application granularity
and without delegation of sub-trees, the two are basically equivalent.
The plans I currently have will allow a migration path from such a model
to one with a finer granularity level where sub systems delegate sub trees
to eachother in a pass by reference way.
