I think the description at your website leaves out the truly interesting part:
How do you decentralize this securely?
- How do Alice, Bob, Charlie and Dave communicate, i.e. which network is used for communication and how?
- How does Alice know that Bob, Charlie and Dave are not the same person?
(= how do you prevent a Sybil attack?)
Because thats the real problem with mixing it seems - ensuring that your mixing partners are actually 100 people and not just 1 attacker. There are probably many mixing algorithms which work if you solve that problem, but I don't see how you offer a solution for it :(

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Reconsidering github 
Assuming there is a problem with that usually is caused by using Git the wrong way or not knowing its capabilities. Nobody can modify / insert a commit before a GnuPG signed commit / tag without breaking the signature.
More detail at the bottom at [1], I am sparing you this here because I suspect you already know it and there is something more important I want to stress:
Bitcoin has currently 4132 forks on Github. This means that you can get contributions by pull requests from 4132 developers. That is a HUGE amount, and you shouldn't ditch that due to not using all features of git :)
To get a grasp of how much that is: When you search projects with more than 4100 forks, there are only 32 of them!
You are one of the top open source projects, and you should be grateful for that and keep Github up so the other people can send you pull requests with their improvements :) Volunteer contributions need to be honored and made as easy as possible, for people are investing their personal time.
Greetings and thanks for your work,
[1] If you GPG-sign a commit / tag, you sign its hash, including the hash of the previous commit. So is a chain of hashes and thus of trust from all commits up to what is signed. It's pretty similar to the blockchain actually :) So Github cannot modify anything. If they did,  the head of the hash-chain would change, and thus the signature would break. Git would notify people about that when they pull. Of course people can still ignore that warning and let Github rewrite their Git history. But people who aren't educated about this shouldn't be release managers. They should not even have push access to your main repository, they should only be sending pull requests. Thats is where the decentralization of Git is: In the pull-requests. The people who deal with them should verify tag and possibly even commit signatures carefully, and not accept anything which is not signed. Also, before deploying a binary, the very same commit which is going to become a binary has to be given a signed tag by the release manager, and by everyone who reviews the code. The person who deploys the actual binary needs to verify that signature.
There is an article which elaborates on some of the ways you have to ensure Github doesn't insert malicious code - but please read it with care, some of its recommendations are bad, especially the part where its about rebasing because that DOES rewrite history which is what you want to prevent:

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Proposal: Encrypt bitcoin messages 
Instead of spawning a discussion whether this aspect is a reason to NOT encrypt, you should do the obvious:
Fix that as well. X being broken is not a reason for not fixing Y.
Pad the then encrypted packets with random bytes. The fact that they are encrypted makes them look like random data already, so the padding will not be distinguishable from the rest.
Also, add some random bias to their timing.
And besides: It would be nice if everyone could acknowledge that making Bitcoin as anonymous as possible is a natural desire. People demanding you to do this is bound to happen over and over again until you do it :) So just get on with it instead of postponing it due to doubts.
There is Tor, there is Freenet, and there are other anonymous P2P networks, and they can help you do get it done - the said problems have been well-known there for quite some time and people have thought about how to solve them.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Lets discuss what to do if SHA256d is 
Hash: SHA256
I thought a lot about the worst case scenario of SHA256d being broken in a way which could be abused to A) reduce the work of mining a block by some significant amount
B) reduce the work of mining a block to zero, i.e. allow instant mining.
Bitcoin needs to be prepared for this as any hash function has a limited lifetime. Usually crypto stuff is not completely broken instantly by new attacks but gradually. For example first the attack difficulty is reduced from 2^128 to 2^100, then 2^64, etc.
This would make scenario A more likely.
Now while B sounds more dangerous, I think in fact A is:
Consider how A would happen in real life: Someone publishes a paper of a theoretical reduction of SHA256d attacks to 2^96 bit. Mathematicians will consider this as a serious attack and create a lot of riot.
If no plan is made early enough, as in now, the Bitcoin Core team might then probably want to just do the easiest approach of replacing the hash function after a certain block number, i.e. a hard fork.
But what about the Bitcoin miners, those who need to actually accept a change of mining algorithm which renders their hardware which cost MILLIONS completely worthless?
Over the years they have gotten used to exponential growth of the Bitcoin networks hashrate, and therefore exponential devaluation of their mining hardware. Even if the attack on SHA256d causes a significant growth of difficulty, the miners will not *believe* that it is an actual attack on SHA256d - - maybe it is just some new large mining operation?  They are used to this happening! Why should they believe this and switch to a new hash function which requires completely new hardware and therefore costs them millions?
They will just keep mining SHA256d. Thats why this is more dangerous, because changing the hash funciton won't be accepted by the miners even though it is Something smarter needs to be thought of.
Now I must admit that I am not good at cryptography at all, but I had the following idea: Use the altcoin concept of having multiple hash functions in a chain. If SHA256d is broken, it is chained with a new hash function.
Thereby, people who want to mine the new replacement hash function still will need ASICs which can solve the old SHA proof of work. So existing ASIC owners can amend their code to do SHA256d using the ASIC, and then the second hash function using a general purpose CPU.
This would also allow a smooth migration of difficulty - I don't even know how difficulty would react with the naive approach of just replacing SHA with something else: It would probably be an unsolvable problem to define new rules to make it decrease enough so new blocks can actually be mined by the now several orders of magnitude slower CPU-only mining community but still be high enough to be able to deal with the fact that millions of people will try their luck with mining at the release date.
While this sounds simple in theory, it might be a lot of work to implement, so you guys might want to take precautions for it soon :)

Hey folks,
FYI the issue is that Luke-Jr wants to include code which can censor stuff like SatoshiDice transactions because he thinks they are denial of service:
While everyone is jumping on the neutrality Bitcoin should have, you're forgetting that there are also *legal* implications:
The *technical ability'* to filter certain types of network traffic can cause you to be legally liable to *USE* it to filter illegal stuff. So even if the filter code is disabled by default, it can put Bitcoin users in legal danger: Law enforcement can try to force them to use it.
This for sure depends on the country you are living in, but in general I think it can be agreed that it will be a lot easier to defend a "my node relays everything uncensored" policy against law enforcement if you wouldn't even have the technical ability to filter stuff because the code just cannot do it anyway. So please do not even include this code as disabled, and if possible do not even write or publish it :)
Also, as I don't have a Gentoo bugtracker account, can someone please add this comment there?

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Analyzing mathematical / scientific sanity of XT's 
For sake of peace, I wanted to give a chance to XT's block size growth efforts by actually *reading* BIP101 [1] which seems to be their specification.
Thus, please read this mail as something which aims to establish peaceful cooperation between the non-XT and XT community; not as something which wants to brush off BIP101 :)
Please also be aware that I am an outside non-Bitcoin developer, and thus judge the document merely from the stuff which it actually contains, not from discussions during its development.
I hope this actually allows increased objectivity: A scientific document such as BIP101 should be fully self-contained.
BIP101 proposes this:
I.e. a fixed function instead of adaptive, demand-based growth.
Let us for a moment give the benefit of doubt and blindly assume that a fixed function is better than the adaptive growth which I advocated [2].
If we ignore the reasons [3] behind the choice of the initial value of 8MB for simplicity, what this function aims to model is this:
So you're trying to match a natural process of resource growth with a bounded exponential growth function. I would blind-guess the natural growth to be something like [4] or [5]. Your function is not symmetrical, so it is for sure not aims to be [4], rather maybe close to [5] ?
Let us blindly assume it is a honorable and adequate way of limiting resource usage to try to limit usage of a resource (= block size) to a function which matches measured natural supply of the resource (= available CPU / storage / network as the proposed function aims to model).
We can probably all say that this is a standard scientific behavior, and used in many systems.
Now what is also the mathematical / scientific standard is this:
If you aim to match a natural dataset with a model function of it, you 1) a plot of the measurements of the natural data you're trying to match. I.e. you plot your source data behind "based on long-term growth trends for CPU power, storage, and Internet bandwidth". I am unable to locate such a plot in the BIP101 document; and also not a link to the raw source data. Can you please provide at least the raw data, if not a plot?
2) a plot of your model function. Also cannot find this in BIP101. Can you please provide it?
3) a joined plot of 1 and 2. This is what will prove whether your model is adequate: If the source data and your model function match, it is. This is the central thing I am missing in BIP101.
I would be happy if you could provide the plots, or at least the raw data. I would love to offer help with GnuPlot, but this will take some weeks [6].
Let me stress further possible mathematical problems which show why the plots are important for deciding whether BIP101 is a good idea:
Once we have a plot of the functions, the central question will be this:
Has the natural source data sufficiently revealed its saturation curve so we can guess its defining constants?
This is important because: While the logistic function [4] seems to be symmetrical, and thus the constants are revealed without nature reaching saturation yet, it is quite possible that the natural growth of CPU / disk / network is rather a generalised logistic function [5] which is not symmetrical. Then we would have to wait until saturation starts so we can guess the constants needed to model it.
Thus, if natural growth has not reached the beginning of saturation yet, and the saturation curve cannot be guessed, it is questionable of whether BIP101 is adequate: It is then possible that natural saturation is slower than BIP101-saturation (= more resources will be available than consumed), and in the future we will reach a situation where blocks are smaller than the natural capacity again.
Then the whole discussion to increase block size will happen again - but possibly with a much larger economy behind Bitcoin, and thus much less possibility of reaching consensus.
Thus, in conclusion, please:
- provide plots, or at least data.
- once you have the plots, be open to scientifically admit that BIP101 might be insufficient if the plots show the open questions I have just elaborated. I am also open to admitting that your data is sufficient from what I can say DISCLAIMER: I am in no way good at math. Hence please only use my elaborations to disprove stuff, not to prove it.
       (while it existed for 16 years, we only have 3 months of funding left,
        so please excuse me abusing this publicity to say that we accept
        Bitcoin donations :)
[1] [2] Notice: Similar to what is said in the main part of the mail about data and plots, it would be nice to provide source data and plots for this as well.
[4] [5] [6] I'm busy with finishing my bachelor's thesis for the next two weeks, which is rather very important to me :) Afterwards, I am willing to help with GnuPlot. But I think it is crucial to resolve the fears of the community much sooner, so you should maybe consider plotting this yourself.

Remember, the previous v0.11.0 release notes said:

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Three Month bitcoin-dev Moderation Review 
The original mail which announced moderation contains this rule:
I assume "+1s" means statements such as "I agree with doing X".
Any sane procedure of deciding something includes asking the involved people whether they're for or against it.
If there are dozens of proposals on how to solve a particular technical problem, how else do you want to decide it than having a vote?
It's very strange that this is not allowed - especially if we consider that the Bitcoin community is in a state of constant dissent currently.
The effect is likely that you push the actual decision-making to IRC, which less people have access to (since it's difficult to bear the high traffic), and thus form some kind of "inner circle" - which makes decisions seem even more as if they're being dictated.
So please consider allowing people to say whether they agree with something something or don't.
Other than that, thanks for the good latency of moderation, I guess you're doing hard work there :)

So "+1"ing is OK as long as I provide a technical explanation of why I agree?
While I still think that this is too much of a restriction because it prevents peer-review, I would say that I could live with it as a last resort if you don't plan to abolish this rule altogether.
So in that case, to foster peer review, I would recommend you amend the rules to clarify this.
Example: "+1s are not allowed unless you provide an explanation of why you agree with something".

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 release candidate 1 available 
Thanks. The RC2 changelog now says:
From having read the Bitcoin whitepaper quite a few months ago ago, I have the very very basic understanding that pruning is meant to:
- delete old transaction data which merely "moves coins around"
- instead only store the "origin" (= block where coins were mined) and "current location" of the coins, i.e. the unspent transactions. Notably, I understood it as "this is as secure as storing everything, since we know where the coins were created, and where they are".
So from that point of view, I would assume that there is a "natural" amount of megabytes which a fully pruned blockchain consists of: It would be defined by the final amount of unspent coins.
I thereby am confused why it is possible to configure a number of megabytes "to allot for raw block & undo data". I would rather expect pruning just to be a boolean on/off flag, and the number of megabytes to be an automatically computed result from the natural size of the dataset.
And especially, I fear that I could set N too low, and as a result, it would delete "too much". I mean could this result in even security relevant transaction data being deleted?
Thus, it would be nice if you could yet once more edit the release notes to:
- explain why a N must be given
- what a "safe" value of N is. I.e. how large must N be at least to not delete security-relevant stuff?
- maybe mention if there is a "auto" setting for N to ensure that it choses a safe value on its own?
Sorry if my descriptions are from a layman's point of view. I intentionally did *not* re-read the Bitcoin whitepaper to have a better understanding:
I think having a layman's understanding is a good usability test for such
