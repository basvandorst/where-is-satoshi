Given there is no money at stake in these prediction games, it is no surprise that the results are implausible.

I'm also a user who runs a full node, and I also like this idea. I think Gavin has done some back-of-the-envelope calculations around this stuff, but nothing so clearly defined as what you propose.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Why Satoshi's temporary anti-spam measure 
On July 29, 2015 7:15:49 AM EDT, Mike Hearn via bitcoin-dev:
I respectfully disagree with this analysis. The implication is that bitcoin is merely one of a number of payment technologies. It's much more than that. It's sound money, censorship resistance, personal control over money, programmable money, and more. Without these attributes it's merely a really inefficient way to do payments. Given these advantages, there is no reason to believe the marginal cost of a transaction can't far surpass that of a PayPal or bank transfer. I personally would pay several multiples of the competitors' fees to continue using bitcoin.
Sure, some marginal use cases will drop off with greater fees, but that's normal and expected. These will be use cases where the user doesn't care about bitcoin's advantages. We must be willing to let these use cases go anyway, because we unfortunately don't have room on chain for everything anyone might want to do.
Therefore, bitcoin tx fees can go much higher than the competition.
Remember how Satoshi referenced the banking crisis in his early work? The 2008 banking crisis was about a lot of things, but high credit card and paypal fees wasnt one of them. There's more going on here than just payments. Any speculative economic analysis would do better to include this fact.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] The need for larger blocks 
Which market participants are you referring to?
I entered the bitcoin market with open eyes, aware that it faces hard scalability challenges by design. I was also aware that because of these challenges, eventually transaction fees would have to rise.
Nevertheless, I made the decision to invest because of the utility I gain from the anti-censorship, privacy, control, store of value, and security aspects of bitcoin -- many of which stem from decentralization, which others have demonstrated to be linked to the block size.
On the other hand, there are undoubtedly other market participants who heard hype about "zero fee transactions to anywhere in the world", believed it would scale, and made (mal)investments as a result.
As for how many market participants of each flavor, and how deep their respective pockets, who knows? My experience in markets has lead me to realize that it's never wise to assume I know what "the market" does and doesn't know. If Jeff Garzik is right about what the market has priced in, then yes, filled blocks will be rocking the boat. But who's to say that the smartest, biggest investors and traders don't already see this scaling problem, and have already priced it in? In this case, a sudden large increase in the block size is actually rocking the boat. The point is, you can't know either way, so trying to pre-empt the market in this way is erroneous.
Regarding entrepreneurial investment specifically, why should we favor the entrepreneurs who require a more centralized bitcoin over those who were more considerate of the possibility of rising transaction fees when making their business models?
In my mind, we should favor neither, which is why I'm basically in agreement with Pieter that this sense of "emergency" shouldn't really be a part of the debate.
Not that I'm taking a stand on the specific block size issue either way. I just think this particular line of reasoning (presupposing what information the market has and has not already baked in) is unsound.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Proposed alternatives to the 20MB step 
Along the lines of aligning incentives with a diversity of costs to a variety of network participants, I am curious about reactions to Justus' general approach:
I realize it relies on pie-in-the-sky ideas like micropayment channels, but I wonder if it's a worthy long-term ideal direction for this stuff.

This strikes me as a leap. There are alternatives that still use bitcoin as the unit of value, such as sidechains, offchain, etc. To say that these are "not bitcoin" is misleading.
Are we sure that raising the block size is the only way to avoid "unpredictable transaction failure"? If so, and it's as bad as you say it is, aren't we screwed anyway when we inevitably start hitting the cap (even if it's raised 10x or 20x)? And if that's the case, then don't we do a disservice to users by continuing to pretend that we can make this problem go away?
On what do you base this? Gold has a very high cost of using (storage, transport) and yet is perhaps the most widely accepted store of value.
