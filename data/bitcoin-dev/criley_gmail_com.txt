I agree that finding the right line is difficult and purposefully crippling
(too strong a term?) the software is not necessarily the best way to
encourage long term adoption.
For example, I ran version 0.3.x from July/August 2010 for several years on
a miner without upgrading to anything higher than the 0.3.24 release since
the usage pattern on that machine didn't require it.  It might have been to
the ~0.7.0 release, I am not sure when I finally upgraded it.  On a machine
that had my wallet, I kept it updated, but forcing upgrades may not be the
best plan given that hard forks should be few and far between.  Security
updates, are important, but leaving it up to the operator of the node to
determine when to upgrade is an important feature.

This seems to be drifting off into alt-coin discussion.  The idea that we
can change the rules and steal coins at a later date because they are
"stale" or someone is "hoarding" is antithetical to one of the points of
bitcoin in that you can no longer control your own money ("be your own
bank") because someone can at a later date take your coins for some reason
that is outside your control and solely based on some rationalization by a
third party.  Once the rule is established that there are valid reasons why
someone should not have control of their own bitcoins, what other reasons
will then be determined to be valid?
I can imagine Hal Finney being revived (he was cryo-preserved at Alcor if
you aren't aware) after 100 or 200 years expecting his coins to be there
only to find out that his coins were deemed "stale" so were "reclaimed" (in
the current doublespeak - e.g. stolen or confiscated).  Or perhaps he
locked some for his children and they are found to be "stale" before they
are available.  He said in March 2013, "I think they're safe enough" stored
in a paper wallet.  Perhaps any remaining coins are no longer "safe enough."
Again, this seems (a) more about an alt-coin/bitcoin fork or (b) better in
bitcoin-discuss at best vs bitcoin-dev. I've seen it discussed many times
since 2010 and still do not agree with the rational that embracing allowing
someone to steal someone else's coins for any reason is a useful change to

is believed QC or Moore's law could impact bitcoin.  Changing bitcoin so as
to require that early coins start getting "scavenged" at that date seems
unneeded and irresponsible.  Besides, your ECDSA is only revealed when you
spend the coins which does provide some quantum resistance.  Hal was just
an example of people putting their coins away expecting them to be there at
X years in the future, whether it is for himself or for his kids and wife.

necessary to partially ignore short-term gain for long-term benefit. It is
in miners and everybody's long-term interest to have a reliable transaction
service. A busy transaction service that confirms lots of transactions per
hour will become more profitable as demand increases and more users are
prepared to pay for priority. As it is there is currently no way to fully
scale because of the transaction bandwidth limit and that is problematic.
If all valid transactions must eventually confirm then there must be a way
to resolve that problem.

proposal is a glowing endorsement. I understand that there would be
technical issues to resolve in implementation, but, are there no
fundamental errors?
been waiting in the pool then, each node could simply keep track of when a
transaction was first seen. This may have implications for a verify
routine, however, for example, if a node was offline, how should it
differentiate how long each transaction was waiting in that case? If a node
was restarted daily would it always think that all transactions had been
waiting in the pool less than one day If each node keeps the current
transaction pool in a file and updates it, as transactions are included in
blocks and, as new transactions appear in the pool, then that would go some
way to alleviate the issue, apart from entirely new nodes. There should be
no reason the contents of a transaction pool files cannot be shared without
agreement as to the transaction pool between nodes, just as nodes transmit
new transactions freely.
how many transactions to include in a block, I say it is a standoff and
miners will conform to the proposal, not wanting to leave transactions with
valid fees standing, and, not wanting to shrink the transaction pool. In
any case, if miners shrink the transaction pool then I am not immediately
concerned since it provides a more efficient service. For the question of
including transactions according to the proposal, I say if it is possible
to keep track of how long transactions are waiting in the pool so that they
can be included on a probability curve then it is possible to verify that
blocks conform to the proposal, since the input is a probability, the
output should conform to a probability curve.

target confirmation from the fee recommendation. That transaction has still
not confirmed after now more than six days - even waiting twice as long
seems quite reasonable to me. That transaction is a valid transaction; it
is not rubbish, junk or, spam. Under the current model with transaction
bandwidth limitation, the longer a transaction waits, the less likely it is
ever to confirm due to rising transaction numbers and being pushed back by
transactions with rising fees.
transactions might be spam. Having an ever-increasing number of valid
transactions that do not confirm as more new transactions with higher fees
are created is the opposite of operating a robust, reliable transaction
confirm. Even a business choosing a modest fee has no guarantee that their
valid transaction will not be shuffled down by new transactions to the
realm of never confirming after it is created. Consumers also will not
accept this model as Bitcoin expands. If Bitcoin cannot be a reliable
payment system for confirmed transactions then consumers, by and large,
will simply not accept the model once they understand. Bitcoin will be a
dirty payment system, and this will kill the value of Bitcoin.
the lucky few who have fees high enough to escape being pushed down the
every ten minutes, only those choosing twenty-minute confirmation (2
blocks) will have initially at most a fifty percent chance of ever having
their payment confirm. Presently, not even using fee recommendations can

transactions are tried to see if they will be included.

appropriate. Perhaps a mathematician with experience in probability can
develop the right formulae. My thinking is a steep curve. I suppose that
the probability of all transactions should probably account for a
sufficient number of inclusions that the target block size is met although,
it may not always be. As a suggestion, consider including some zero fee
transactions to pad, highest BTC value first?
one-hundred (high) it can be directly understood as the percentage chance
in one-hundred of a transaction being included in the block. Using
probability or likelihood infers that there is some function of random. If
random (100) < transaction priority then the transaction is included.
waiting on a curve value are each a number between one and one-hundred, a
rudimentary method may be to simply multiply those two numbers, to find the
priority number. For example, a middle fee transaction waiting thirty days
(if n = 60 days) may have a value of five for each part  (yes, just five,
the values are on a curve). When multiplied that will give a priority value
of twenty-five, or,  a twenty-five percent chance at that moment of being
included in the block; it will likely be included in one of the next four
blocks, getting more likely each chance. If it is still not included then
the value of time waiting will be higher, making for more probability. A
very low fee transaction would have a value for the fee of one. It would
not be until near sixty-days that the particular low fee transaction has a
high likelihood of being included in the block.
reason for addressing the issue is to ensure transactional reliability and
scalability while having each transaction confirm in due time.

a fee distribution. Any zero fee transactions would have to be ignored.
