proposals, please let me know. Especially if there are any
suggestions on how the signature section can be revised.

I've renamed it to "Bitcoin Developer Specification" a little while ago.
Maybe it should rather be named "Bitcoin Developer Reference"? Either
way, creating a good description of Bitcoin is an incremental process
and there are certainly many quirks I'm not aware of. I hope that
together we will soon be able to fill in the missing gaps.
Warm greetings,
Krzysztof Okupski

plenty of
comments from Bitcoin Core developers, Bitcoin enthusiasts and many others.
For the encouraging words and improvement proposals I'm very grateful. I
to incorporate to the best of my abilities and am happy to present a
revised version.
As before, it can be found under:
I hope it will prove useful to the community and thank in advance for
any further
improvement proposals.
Kind regards,

Dear all,
I'd like to kindly ask, those of you that have a bit of spare time, to
take a look at a Bitcoin protocol specification I've written. It is still
in development and, as some of you have already indicated, needs
improvement. I'd be very thankful if some of you could take the
time to review it. If there are any errors or suggestions from your
side, I'd gladly hear them. My e-mail can be found on the front page
of the document:
Warm greetings,

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Bitcoin API Wrapper 
Dear everyone,
I've developed a C++ wrapper for JSON-RPC communication with
an existing Bitcoin installation. For everyone that is a developer and
interested in building extensions or alike, this might prove useful.
The code can be found on GitHub:
