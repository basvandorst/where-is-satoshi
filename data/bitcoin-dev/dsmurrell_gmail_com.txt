Dear All
I'm not sure this is welcome here. Someone suggested I let the devs
know about it here. I've made an open forum on which to post
discussion about cryptocurrency related research:
Jeff helped me with the naming a bit some time ago. It's not had much
attention but then I've not advertised it much.
Please check it out and let me know if something like this is
worthwhile in this community. I'm not aware of much of the research
myself but a central repo of it seemed lacking and this adds
discussion capabilities to the repo.
If you guys have any potential use case for this, please consider
holding some of your discussions about research that interests you
here. If it gets core devs talking on it (if it's actually useful to
you that is), then I'm sure that others will be inspired to use it.
Even just one discussion thread will help if this regard.
It's not for profit so I'm not trying to make any money out of you.
It's just an experiment.
Kind regards
Daniel Murrell

I've already added it here:
I made this site to allow discussions on exactly these sorts of things
to be publicly visible and easily discoverable in the future (this is
why I replied to all).
Please let me know what you think of the site.
p.s. I'm not trying to monetize this site. I just tried to make
something I thought could be useful.

Sorry Bryan, this was the first paper posted to this list since I've
been on it that I added to my site. I was quite excited about this.
I was not planning on and certainly won't be making this advertisement
after every paper posted on this list (I may do it on reddit). I did
post on reddit a few times yes, but I assumed that this list's user
base didn't overlap extremely (does it?). I'm not sure why my posts
got down voted there. The down voters gave me no constructive feedback
about the usefulness of my site, and neither have you.
Are you able to give me your feedback on the site I've spent quite
some time setting up privately so that we don't spam this list again?
