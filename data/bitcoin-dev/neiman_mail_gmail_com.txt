@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] How accurate are the Bitcoin timestamps? 
First time posting here, please be gentle.
I'm doing a research project about blockchain timestamping. There are many
such projects, including the fantastic OpenTimestamps.
All of the projects essentially save some data in a block, and rely on the
block timestamp as a proof that this data existed at some specific time.
But how accurate are Bitcoins timestamps?
I didn't find any discussion or research regarding Bitcoin timestamp
accuracy (also not in the history of this mailing list). I share here a
simple analysis of timestamp accuracy, and a suggestion how to improve it.
Basic observations and questions:
We may consider exchanging average with standard deviation in the
difficulty adjustment formula. It both better mirrors changes in the hash
power along the interval, and disables the option to manipulate timestamps
without affecting the difficulty.
I'm aware that this change requires a hardfork, and won't happen any time
soon. But does it make sense to add it to a potential future hard fork?

Thank you for replying. I agree that under the 50%+ assumption, timestamps
are reasonably accurately, but I fail to see a reason to make this
I'm comfortable with the 50%+ assumption regarding ledger manipulation
(double-spending, deletion of transactions etc.). I'm much less comfortable
with it regarding timestamps manipulation.
Consider the following situation:
(1) miners are selfish,
(2) miners have a financial incentive to be dishonest.
(1) is a common state on how miners function nowadays. (2) is the case that
interests us when coming to do this analysis.
In the case of ledger manipulation, the 50%+ assumption is not because we
assume that miners are good-hearted (this violates (1)). It is there due to
an assumption that the financial damage to a miner would be bigger than the
gain in (2). This happens since a ledge manipulation may cause miners to
lose block rewards, and certainly will devaluate Bitcoin, an asset which
they possess.
In the case of timestamps manipulation, I don't see any financial damage
caused to miners. Timestamps manipulation (besides the 2016*n blocks) won't
harm the function of Bitcoin, and may even go undetected (it seems to me
that the main blockchain explorers don't track it). I don't see a
justification for the 50%+ assumption here.

Could you say a few more words about this lack of security? Or share a link
if you have one. I know very little about NTPs.
