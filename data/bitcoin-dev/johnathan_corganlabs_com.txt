@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Proposal: MultiBit as default desktop 
By way of endorsement, at the GNU Radio Project we switched to
CloudFlare's free service tier a few months ago.  We host on AWS EC2 our
own web servers, downloads, and git repositories.  CloudFlare has
reduced our bandwidth bill by about 50%, with very little pain.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Message Signing based authentication 
Anyone else concerned about signing an arbitrary string?  Could be a
hash of $EVIL_DOCUMENT, no?  I'd want to XOR the string with my own
randomly generated nonce, sign that, then pass the nonce and the
signature back to the server for verification.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] the XBT 
My understanding is that XBT is a proposed standard, and hasn't been
approved by ISO yet.  Did that change?

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Proposal: Encrypt bitcoin messages 
I'm still trying to understand the original premise that we want
encrypted communications between nodes.
I can certainly see the value of having *authenticated* traffic with
specific nodes, using an HMAC for the protocol messages in place of the
current checksum.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Stealth Addresses 
I agree wholeheartedly against using "reusable address".  I personally
am fine with "stealth address", but can see where there might be a
negative connotation.
Might I suggest "master address", which is neutral in connotation, but
indicates both that it is fixed and that payment addresses are generated
as needed from it.
But please, no "reusable address."

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] request BIP number for: "Support for Datastream 
?The trade-off decisions among bandwidth savings, CPU performance, and
latency are local, and I think it shouldn't be assumed that any particular
node will want to support it.  I recommend that if P2P message compression
is implemented, it should be negotiated via the services field at
connection time.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] request BIP number for: "Support for Datastream 
?This reinforces the idea that such trade-off decisions should be be local
and negotiated between peers, not a required feature of the network P2P.?

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] How to evaluate block size increase suggestions. 
This topic is straying from Bitcoin development into general Bitcoin
governance, policy, or other meta-issues.
We have now the new bitcoin-discuss mailing list now, specifically for
these more free-flowing topics:
Please take further discussion of this thread to that forum.
Thank you,

There was some confusion over the following email which was posted to the list
which appears to have been cancelled before a decision could be reached.
Please note the email seems inflammatory in the "acknowledgement" section and
really should have been rewritten to contain specific details of the objection
and corrections expected.
To be clear posts to the mailing list are either approved, or rejected for not
meeting the posting standards. This allows the author to make a quick correction
and resubmit. All rejections are cc'd to

with lots of distractions one for everyone :)
I'm copying the entire message below:
