I strongly object to removing the only mechanism that allows anyone to say
that bitcoin is p2p, in the truest sense of the word. Moves like this that
favor only the pool operators and private mining interests are signs that
bitcoin is headed towards a monopoly/cartel model, and that would be a
tragic outcome for something that holds a great promise. Nobody knows what
mining will look like in the future, and denying the individual novice the
ability to mine at a small scale, even if we may think it is inefficient
now, is not a good path to start down.
If there are technical problems with getwork, maybe they should be
addressed and fixed instead of outright abandoned.

Well, he did make the bitcoin.org/may15.html page already. It would be
crazy to change that now.

The problem with academics is that they don't have to worry about the real
world. They get paid to publish things, not to be helpful to society.

Has anyone from Mycelium weighed in on this? Is their doublespend attack
detection broken with this kind of irresponsible behavior?

If you're going to go through the trouble of signing your public emails,
please publish your public key on a major key server or at least somewhere
where google can crawl it. Thank you.

Whenever a public key is altered in any way it should be
resubmitted/republished, so yes, please do so.
DO NOT PUBLISH YOUR PRIVATE KEY. That is the data used to sign a document.
You only need to publish your PUBLIC KEY or otherwise share it with
recipients of your signed message so that others can verify it as properly
signed or not.
