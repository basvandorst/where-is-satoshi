@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Password-protected private key export format 
Hi folks,
I've been working on a new private key export format that includes
simple password-protection.  Details of the scheme are posted at:
It is intended as an interchange format, not specifically integrated
with wallet encryption, and simple enough to be produced by the
vanitygen program.  Importing to the official bitcoin client using a
method like the import/export patch would require the user to provide
the password of the private key, in addition to the wallet password if
the wallet is encrypted.
Comments on the format are welcomed!
As the proposed format is base-58, I would like to make a request to use
one of the data classes as proposed by Pieter Wuille about a month ago:
If this doesn't fit with the general bitcoin development agenda, that's
OK too, but I would like to explore some possibility for a protected
export format for private keys.

Hello all,
The description of the password-protected export format has been revised
slightly, and now includes multiple algorithms and a parameter byte for
selecting the encryption parameters.  As before, the thread is here:
Unless there is an existing or other planned use for data class 32, or
another specific objection, I would like to use it for
password-protected private keys.  Going by Sipa's description, this
would mean that a password-protected private key for bitcoin is type 32,
and for the testnet, type 79.
