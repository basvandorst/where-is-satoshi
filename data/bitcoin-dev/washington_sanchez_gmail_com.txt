@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Dynamic limit to the block size - BIP draft discussion 
Hi everyone,
I know many of us feel that the last thing the Bitcoin community needs is
another BIP related to the block size, but after a lot of reading and
commenting, I'd like to throw this idea out there.
I've already written it up as a BIP and would like some constructive
feedback/suggestions/alternatives related to some of the variables in my
Dynamic limit to the block size
The goal is to dynamically increase the maximum block size conservatively,
but allow meaningful relief to transaction volume pressure in response to
true market demand. The specification follows:
- Every 4032 blocks (~4 weeks), the maximum block size will be increased by
10% *IF* a minimum of 2000 blocks has a size >= 60% of the maximum block
size at that time
  + This calculates to theoretically 13 increases per year
- The maximum block size can only ever be increased, not decreased
For example, if this rule were to be instituted January 1st 2016, with a
present maximum block size 1 MB, the limit would be increased to 1.1 MB on
January 29th 2016. The theoretical maximum block size at the end of 2016
would be ~3.45 MB, assuming all 13 increases are triggered.
As the maximum block size rises, so the cost of artificially triggering an
increase in the maximum block size.

A selfish mining attack would have to be performed for at least 2000 blocks
over a period of 4 weeks in order to achieve a meager 10% increase in the
block size.
If there goal is to simply drive up fees to gain acceptance into the block,
we're in exactly the same position we are in today (as in nothing stops a
miner from doing this).
If the goal is to increase the block size to push out smaller miners,
they'll have to perform this attack over the course of years and destroy
any economic incentives they have for mining in the first place.
 why give this power up to a subsection of the ecosystem in order to make
Well this same could be said for developers trying to predict what the
appropriate block size should be over the next 20 years... it's a hallmark
to a group of bankers trying to predict the appropriate interest rate for
the entire economy. Just as it is impossible to predict the appropriate
hash rate to secure the network, so it goes for the block size. Both need
to adjust dynamically to the scale/adoption of the network.

1) It's not really clear to me how that would work, but assuming it does
then it will go into a basket of attacks that are possible but unlikely due
to the economic disincentives to do so.
2) That said, is the Achilles heal of this proposal the lack of a mechanism
to lower the block size?
3) Let me put it another way, I've read that both Gavin and yourself are
favorable to a dynamic limit on the block size. In your view, what is
missing from this proposal, or what variables should be adjusted, to get
the rules to a place where you and other Core developers would seriously
consider it?

Sure thing Gavin.
If you want blocks to be at least 60% full...
First off, I do not want blocks to be at least 60% full, so let me try and
explain where I got this number from
   - The idea of this parameter is set a *triggering level* for an increase
   in the block size
   - The triggering level is the point where a reasonable medium-term trend
   can be observed. That trend is an increase in the transaction volume that,
   left unchecked, would fill up blocks.
   - Determining the appropriate triggering level is difficult, and it
   consists of 3 parameters:
      1. Evaluation period
         - *Period of time where you check to see if the conditions to
         trigger a raise the block size are true *
         - Ideally you want an increase to occur in response to a real
         increase of transaction volume from the market, and not some
short term
         spam attack.
         - Too short, spam attacks can be used to trigger multiple
         increases (at least early on). Too long, the block size
doesn't increase
         fast enough to transaction demand.
         - I selected a period of *4032 blocks*
         2. Capacity
         - *The capacity level that a majority of blocks would demonstrate
         in order to trigger a block size increase*
         - The capacity level, in tandem with the evaluation period and
         threshold level, needs to reflect an underlying trend towards filling
         blocks.
         - If the capacity level is too low, block size increases can be
         triggered prematurely. If the capacity level is too high, the
network could
         be unnecessarily jammed with the transactions before an
increase can kick
         in.
         - I selected a capacity level of *60%*.
      3. Threshold
         - *The number of blocks during the evaluation period that are
         above the capacity level in order to trigger a block size increase.*
         - If blocks are getting larger than 60% over a 4032 block period,
         how many reflect a market-driven increase transaction volume?
         - If the threshold is too low, increases could be triggered
         artificially or prematurely. If the threshold is too high,
the easier it
         gets for 1-2 mining pools to prevent any increases in the
block size or the
         block size doesn't respond fast enough to a real increase in
         volume.
         - I selected a threshold of *2000 blocks or ~50%*.
      - So in my proposal, if 2000+ nodes have a block size >= 60%, this is
   an indication that real transaction volume has increased and we're
   approaching a time where block could be filled to capacity without an
   increase. The block size increase, 10%, is triggered.
A centralized decision, presumably by Satoshi, was made on the parameters
that alter the target difficulty, rather than attempt to forecast hash
rates based on his CPU power. He allowed the system to scale to a level
where real market demand would take it. I believe the same approach should
be replicated for the block size. The trick of course is settling on the
right variables. I hope this proposal is a good way to do that.
*Some additional calculations*
Block sizes for each year are *theoretical maximums* if ALL trigger points
are activated in my proposal (unlikely, but anyway).
These calculations assume zero transactions are taken off-chain by third
party processors or the LN, and no efficiency improvements.
   - 2015
      - 1 MB/block
      - 2 tps (conservative factor, also carried on below)
      - 0.17 million tx/day
   - 2016
      - 3.45 MB/block
      - 7 tps
      - 0.6 million tx/day
   - 2017
      - 12 MB/block
      - 24 tps
      - 2 million tx/day
   - 2018
      - 41 MB/block
      - 82 tps
      - 7 million tx/day
   - 2019
      - 142 MB/block
      - 284 tps
      - 25 million tx/day
   - 2020
      - 490 MB/block
      - 980 tps
      - 85 million tx/day
By way of comparison, Alipay (payment processor for the Alibaba Group's
ecosystem) processes 30 million escrow transactions per day. This gives us
at least 4-5 years to reach the present day transaction processing capacity
of 1 corporation... in reality it will take a little longer as I doubt all
block size triggers will be activated. This also gives us at least 4-5
years to develop efficiency improvements within the protocol, develop the
LN to take many of these transactions off-chain, and network infrastructure
to be significantly improved (and anything else this ecosystem can come up
(let me know if any of these calculations are off)
