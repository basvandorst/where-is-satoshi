@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] I want to rebuild the GUI in JavaScript 
You may find my (incomplete) front-end of interest:
The live demo is backed by a -disablewallet node, but it was able to accept payments and send them via QR codes before I stopped development.
The source is available via AGPLv3.
I am unable to continue development due to time constraints.
