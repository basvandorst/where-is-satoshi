Interesting position there Peter...you fear more people actually using
bitcoin.  The less on chain transactions the lower the velocity and the
lower the value of the network.  I would be careful what you ask for
because you end up having nothing left to even root the security of these
off chain transactions with and then neither will exist.
Nobody ever said you wouldn't run out of capacity at any size.  It's quite
the fallacy to draw the conclusion from that statement that block size
should remain far below a capacity it can easily maintain which would bring
more users/velocity/value to the system.  The outcomes of both of those
scenarios are asymmetric.  A higher block size can support more users and
Raising the blocksize isn't out of fear.  It's the realization that we are
at a point where we can raise it and support more users and transactions
while keeping the downsides to a minimum (centralization etc).

Who said anything about scaling bitcoin to visa levels now?  We're talking
about an increase now that scales into the future at a rate that is
consistent with technological progress.
Peter himself said "So, I think the block size should follow technological
The blocksize increase proposals have been modeled around this very thing.
It's reasonable to increase the blocksize to a point that a reasonable
person, with reasonable equipment and internet access can run a node or
even a miner with acceptable orphan rates.  Most miners are spv mining
anyways.  The 8 or even 20 MB limits are within those parameters.
These are not mutually exclusive.  We can design an increase to blocksize
that addresses both demand exceeding the available space AND follow
technological evolution.  Peter's latest proposal is way too conservative
on that front.

And given Peter's assertion that demand is infinite there will still be a
an ocean of off chain transactions for the likes of blockstream to address.

Peter's proposal undercuts matching blocksize growth to technological
progress not limiting centralization pressure.  They are somewhat related,
but I want to be clear on what I originally stated.  I would also point out
that Peter's proposal lacks this technical criteria as well.
That being said, I think designing any growth rates on theoretical
centralization pressure is not sensible and Peter's proposal rightly
excludes it and attempts instead for a very gradual increase over time
attempting to match blocksize growth that is consistent with technological
bandwidth growth.  The problem is that it ignores the last 6 years (we are
already "behind") and underestimates bandwidth and storage growth. (See
Nielsen's law which states 50% and has held for 30 years).
Peter seems to be of the belief that since bitcoin will never be able to
handle all the world's transactions we should instead "...decrease the need
for trust required in off-chain systems...".  This is akin to basing all
the world's transactions on a small settlement layer, much like balancing a
pyramid upside down it will topple.
I'm of the belief that the "reasonable node" test is a simple enough test
to maintain decentralization.
A raspberry pie 2 node on reasonable Internet connection with a reasonable
hard drive can run a node with 8 or 20mb blocks easily.
As Peter's proposal indicates, "If over time, this growth factor is beyond
what the actual technology offers, the intention should be to soft fork a
tighter limit."  I wholeheartedly agree, which is why we should plan to be
ahead of the curve...not behind it.

I don't think I would classify placing things in consensus critical code
when it doesn't need to be as "structural tidying".  Gavin said "pile on"
which you took as implying "a lot", he can correct me, but I believe he
meant "add to".
user autonomy)
This implies there you have no confidence in the unit tests and functional
testing around Bitcoin and should not be a reason to avoid refactoring.
It's more a reason to increase testing so that you will have confidence
when you refactor.
Also I don't think Martin Fowler would agree with you...
"Refactoring should be done in conjunction with adding new features."
"Always leave the code better than when you found it."
"Often you start working on adding new functionality and you realize the
existing structures don't play well with what you're about to do.
In this situation it usually pays to begin by refactoring the existing code
into the shape you now know is the right shape for what you're about to do."

I see, thanks for clearing that up, I misread what Gavin stated.

Does an unlimited blocksize imply the lack of a fee market?  Isn't every
miner able to set their minimum accepted fee or transaction acceptance

I shouldn't have said unlimited, i should have said a greater blocksize
limit such as 8mb.
Anyways, why is that the assumption?  If a miner can do so, and do so
profitably, isn't that just competition?  Isn't that what we want?  If a
miner can mine low transaction fees at a profit then don't they deserve to
have their spot?  Surely if they do so unprofitably they quickly find
themselves out of business?  Besides, if a miner mines low fee transactions
by breaking rank, how does this affect another miner EXCEPT for the
additional blocksize load.  I would maintain this is just competition
amongst miners gentlemen.  And it's a good thing.
Right now things are distorted because most income comes from the coinbase,
but as transaction fees start to constitute the majority of income this
idea seems to have more importance.
