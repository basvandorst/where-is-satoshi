Hi there,
I was wondering if you guys have come across this article:
The TL;DR is that somebody is abusing the BGP protocol to be in a position
where they can intercept the miner traffic. The concerning point is that
they seem to be having some degree of success in their endeavour and
earning profits from it.
I do not understand the impact of this (I don't know much about BGP, the
mining protocol nor anything else, really), but I thought it might be worth
putting it up here.

However certificate revocation and updates in miners are pain in the ass,
that's why majority of pools (mine including) don't want to play with
Another solution which would have less overhead would be to implement
something akin to what openssh does. The OpenSSH client stores a
certificate fingerprint, which is then verified automatically upon further
connections to the server.
The initial connection needs to be verified manually by the operator,
at connection time, which is a lot harder to maintain than injecting a
client.reconnect. This, combined with your concern about up to date
certs/revokes/etc, is why BFGMiner defaults to TLS without cert checking for
Seems to me that it would correctly mitigate the attack mentioned in the
wired article. I am surprised that miners are not worried about losing
their profits, I would personally be quite annoyed.

I think what he is saying is that there is no point in having three signatures if they are not segregated in a secure manner. This is to say, if you use your computer as one "factor", and a third party website as another, but you use the same computer to access the website, there is no gain in security.
Another example would be an android phone. If your computer is compromised and your browser is authenticated to your Google account, you could remotely install an "app" on your phone.
I don't know if I understood/explained myself correctly; I think two factor is better than one and there is a security gain if implemented

Thank you for your response, that does make sense. It's going to be
interesting to follow what is going to happen!
