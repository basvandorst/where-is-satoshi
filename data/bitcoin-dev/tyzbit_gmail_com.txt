@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Numerifides - Proposal for Decentralized 
I have been working on a proposal called Numerifides which would provide a
general method to register human-readable names and arbitrary data (such as
username->GPG key, domain->IP address, Lightning node Alias-> URI, etc).
Here are the key highlights:
--New transaction type called "numerifides" transactions
--Lock up Bitcoin for a certain amount of time to make the mappings valid,
discourage "namesquatting"
--Transaction puzzle attached to transactions to allow community consensus
revocation of highly contested names or "squatted" name mappings.
--Transactions are RBF so if name is contentious or miners wish to censor,
one honest greedy miner can include the censored user's high-fee
--Solves Zooko's triangle of Secure, Decentralized and Human Meaningful
Full working spec is here: I'd love feedback and possible enhancements, as I know this early rough
draft does have a lot of room for improvement (I also think it would be
remiss to incentivize filling blocks with data like this, and a possible
change proposed on the lightning-dev list by ZmnSCPxj is a P2WSH defining
the mapping that is gossiped about outside of the Bitcoin network, but I'd
like to hear all comments).
Thank you for your time.

Hello again,
I've reworked this idea a bit as alluded to previously.  The key highlights
of Numerifides are now:
- Transaction is a normal transaction paying to a script hash with a
CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY encumbrance.
- Users "mine" their registrations to produce TXIDs with Proof of Work
attached (providing for a way to secure and "commandeer" names).
- Secondary network for gossiping name->data mappings, that is rooted from
the numerifide transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain.
The "mining" is done simply by incrementing a nonce in the registration
data (off-chain).  This prevents "namesquatting" like we see on Namecoin.
There is an easy formula that uses the Timelock, Proof of Work and amount
of Bitcoin locked that determines which transactions are authoritative for
a given name mapping.
Feedback and criticism appreciated,
