@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] More appropriate XDG menu category for 
Hey list,
Currently the bitcoin-qt application's XDG desktop integration on some
desktop environments requests that it be placed under the "Office" menu
category.[1] This is a rather broad category and I would like to suggest
that this be refined further into "Finance", given that XDG's menu
specification allows for this.[2]
I believe the line in question in bitcoin-qt.desktop should be as
        Categories=Office;Finance;
I would have provided this trivial patch myself, but my knowledge of Git
is rather weak and I apologize.
