@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP proposal: Inhibiting a covert attack on the 
Quite different in that the DAO fork was about an application level bug
and this current proposal is about a possibly dangerous incentive at
protocol level.
In the first, a protocol change was called to recover funds lost for an
application level bug. In the latter, a protocol change is being called
to address a perceived incentive problem in the protocol.
A good comparison would be if a protocol level change was being proposed
for a case like mt gox. But it's not.
Plus... This proposal only addresses one covert asicboost and not other
overt forms.
Even though we may, as well, have good reasons to block other overt forms.
