I feel everyone should re-read that last paragraph as it carries the most
weight IMO.

In this scenario how do you ensure the miner solving the block cannot
reapportion the subsidy to himself rather than the pool?

as I understood your proposal the entire block would be created on the
miner rather than just the block header. Currently miners do not receive a
list of transactions, they receive information required to create the block
header, this is how you keep miners honest. if the miner is creating the
full block we are right back to where we were.
I've only worked with implementing the mining process for a few months now
so someone correct me if I have the process wrong
