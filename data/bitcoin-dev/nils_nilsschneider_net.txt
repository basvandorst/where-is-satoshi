@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] BIP process 
That's a good idea. What about using GitHub's Wiki feature for BIPs?
They support MarkDown which is easy to read in text editors so we could
someday create a repo with all finalized BIPs. That's a lot easier than
importing a mediawiki dump. The last time en.bitcoin.it went down I
tried to setup a static mirror and that was nearly impossible without a
full LAMP stack. Also, BIPs should only contain images when absolutely

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Help wanted: translations 
I have exported all .ts to transifex.
I'm now trying to figure out how to use it but it looks like
tx pull && git add src/qt/locale/* && git commit src/qt/locale/ && git push
will be all that's needed to push translation updates from transifex to

I think it's possible to add it yourself. Just click on "add translation"

Can we use a git repo or something more redundant for BIPs? They're
rather important and the wiki has been unreliable before.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] BitCoin and MinorFs/AppArmor 
MinorFs sounds like an interesting concept and but wallet encryption
(already being tested and close to release) is a simpler solution for
Would MinorFs help securing the wallet on a server, maybe even a
(insecure) VPS?
Can it work without changes to Bitcoin? If not, what is the minimal
amount of changes needed?
Is there any guarantee it will never corrupt the wallet?
What would be the proper way to do backups?

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Deprecating "midstate" in getwork? 
I'd like to simplify the internal reference miner and remove all
dependencies on cryptopp (it's the only place we use cryptopp instead of
Unfortunately, cryptopp is also used to calculate getwork "midstate".
This field is redundant and the miner could easily calculate it from the
blockheader so I'd like to remove it.
Any thoughts? Where should such a change should be announced so all
miners can be upgraded?

Yes, that's possible and what
 does. However, deprecating
midstate (and hash1) would allow for much cleaner code.
A pull request for marking midstate (and hash1) as deprecated can be
found at

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Random order for clients page 
I don't think that's a good idea as it can easily confuse or annoy users
when things move around. The ordering should be preserved as much as
possible so users can remember where they found a client they liked
(e.g. 2nd row, 1st column and screenshot with light and blue colors).
Making them search the entire page is inefficient and will just get
worse once there are many clients on the page (and I think that's the goal).
