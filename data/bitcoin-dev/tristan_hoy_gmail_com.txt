Hi all,
Recently I've been exploring what a post-quantum attack on Bitcoin would
actually look like, and what options exist for mitigating it.
I've put up a draft of my research here:
In summary:
1) None of the recommended post-quantum DSAs (XMSS, SPHINCS) are scalable
2) This is a rapidly advancing space and committment to a specific
post-quantum DSA now would be premature
3) I've identified a strategy (solution 3 in the draft) that mitigates
against the worst case scenario (unexpectedly early attack on ECDSA)
without requiring any changes to the Bitcoin protocol or total committment
to a specific post-quantum DSA that will likely be superseded in the next
3-5 years
4) This strategy also serves as a secure means of transferring balances
into a post-quantum DSA address space, even in the event that ECDSA is
fully compromised and the transition is reactionary
The proposal is a change to key generation only and will be implemented by
wallet providers.
Feedback would be most appreciated.

Hi Tim,
Just read through your post, thanks for the heads up - I only just joined
this mailing list.
In a post-quantum world, your second "d" type transaction is completely
forgeable, which means it is vulnerable to front-running. An adversary
capable of breaking ECDSA needs only listen for these transactions, obtain
"classic_sk" and then use a higher fee (or relationship with a miner) to
effectively turn your original "d" transaction into a double-spend, with
the forged transaction sending all your funds to the adversary.
I'm pretty confident that a PQ DSA is required to prevent front-running,
and that no "commit-reveal" scheme will be secure without one.
The other issue with your approach is that if it is rolled out today, it
will effectively double transaction volumes - this is what I tried to solve
in solutions 2 and 3 in my article by instead modifying the address
generation process.

Thank you for clarifying, I should have caught that.
The worst-case outcome is that ECDSA is broken before PQ addresses are rolled out. There is no reactive response to this - all the existing ECDSA addresses will be compromised. A proactive measure is required, and it should be deployed sooner rather than later.
Any two-step approach adopted now as a proactive measure will not only bloat the blockchain, it will also double the effective confirmation time - for all transactions between now and when PQ addresses are rolled out, which seems unlikely to happen in the next 5 years. The bloat will be permanent.
Either way, would you mind if I included your approach in the article, with credit? I will seek your review before publishing.
