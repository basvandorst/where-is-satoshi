It would be nice if the detached signer and the normal wallet could both
verify the correctness of generated addresses before you cause coins to be
sent there.
e.g. the hardware wallet could give its master public key to Bitcoin Core
and you can thereafter generate your receiving addresses on Core, with the
option to have the HW wallet validate them.
One of my biggest fears about using any wallet is the "whoops, cosmic ray
flipped a bit while producing receiving address; SFYL!" possibility. For
high value cold storage, I always generate my addresses on two independent
machines using two different pieces of software. Am I nuts for doing that?
With the above scheme, you are pretty well protected from losing money if
your HW wallet is defective. You could still lose it if the HW wallet was
evil of course, but that strikes me as much more likely to be discovered

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Reasons to add sync flags to Bitcoin 
I posted this to /r/bitcoin yesterday but it got minimal comments. One uses
suggested I try the mailing list so here it is:
The idea presented here could have the following benefits:
1. Improve mining decentralization
2. Reduce variance in mining profitability
3. Reduce or eliminate SPV mined blocks
4. Reduce or eliminate empty blocks, smoothing out resource usage
5. Reduce or eliminate the latency bottleneck on throughput
6. Make transaction stuffing by miners be either obvious or costly
7. Gives miners something to do while they wait for attractive transactions
to appear
8. Can be easily done with a soft fork
 idea:
Ideally, all miners would begin hashing the next block at exactly the same
time. Miners with a head start are more profitable, and the techniques that
help miners receive and validate blocks quickly create centralization
What if there was something that acted like the starting flag at a race,
which could suddenly wave and cause all of the miners to simultaneously
begin hashing the next block?
Let a sync flag be a message consisting of:
1. Hash of the previous block.
2. Bitcoin address
3. Nonce
This tiny message could propagate through the network at maximum speed. If
miners had to include the hash of this flag in the next block, then all
miners wait for this flag, and when it suddenly spread through the network,
all miners could simultaneously begin hashing the next block.
The sync flag should not be produced too quickly. You want to give everyone
enough time to be ready to hash the next block. Let's say that the hash of
the sync flag is a proof of work that is targeted for 2 minutes.
To fund this proof of work, the protocol is modified to demand that the
block produced 10 blocks after the sync flag must allocate 25% of the block
reward to the address published by the sync flag. In this way, sync flags
are produced in 2 minutes, and blocks are produced in 8 minutes, with 10
minutes total.
Illustration 1: Illustration 2:  of reasons:
**Improve mining decentralization**
One factor driving centralization is the imperative miners have to achieve
low latency in receiving and validating blocks. To achieve low latency, it
helps a lot if you have expensive low-latency internet connections, curated
network topologies, and large pools that have a plausible chance of finding
consecutive blocks. If miners are expected (or forced) to validate a block
prior to mining on top of it, the rational end game would be to outsource
the validation step to a trusted third party specialist who can choose
optimal locations on the globe to serve their (multiple?) mining pool
clients. These are all less decentralized than the mining situation Satoshi
and others imagined.
**Reduce variance in mining revenue**
Currently, there are about 144 opportunities per day for a pool or solo
miner to see any revenue at all. With sync flags, that number doubles to
288. Sync flags are only worth 25% of what a block is worth, but this still
represents a significant reduction in variance. This variance is one factor
causing solo miners to group into pools, and large pools to be more
attractive than small pools.
**Reduce or eliminate SPV mined blocks**
One way miners have sought to make
full-block-transmission-and-validation-latency irrelevant has been through
"SPV" mining or "Head-first" mining. There is some evidence that these
techniques may be widely used, and that badgering the miners about it is an
ineffective strategy to stop them.
In SPV mining, a miner would simply accept any block header that shows the
correct proof of work. All other validation is entrusted to other miners.
This practice is quite dangerous as the SPV miners can wander off on some
invalid chain, taking SPV nodes with them. If this occurs during a soft
fork, these blind miners can also fool unupgraded fully validating nodes
into following them.
"Head-first" mining means that miners start hashing as soon as they receive
the block header with the correct POW, but they simultaneously validate the
block, and abandon it if is not valid. I consider this to be pretty safe,
as it strictly limits the length of an invalid chain that can result from
mining without validating. However, "Head-first" mining can plausibly
generate 2 or 3 confirmations of an invalid block. It would be nice if such
confirmations did not happen.
The sync flag technique is similar to head-first mining, but rather than
hashing the next block while they wait for transmission and validation of
the prior block, they hash the sync flag. Nodes can differentiate between
sync flags and blocks, and can ignore sync flags when counting
**Reduce or eliminate empty blocks, smoothing out resource usage**
Empty blocks are another consequence of SPV or Headfirst mining, because
the miner cannot safely include any transactions in the block they are
hashing until they have validated the prior block. By delaying the start of
hashing the next block until after validation, miners would not have this
reason to mine empty blocks.
**Reduce or eliminate the latency bottleneck on throughput**
Centralization pressure due to latency issues has been a major
preoccupation over the last year. If latency mattered much less, it could
represent a scalability improvement that could enable higher throughput.
**Make transaction stuffing by miners be either obvious or costly**
Currently, the entire block reward goes to the miner who mines it. One
unfortunate consequence of this is that it does not cost the miner anything
to covertly stuff the block with transactions. These transactions would pay
fees and be indistinguishable from ordinary transactions, but the fees are
paid by the miner and then immediately returned to the miner.
With sync flags, the miner must share these transaction fees with the
address contained in the sync flag 10 blocks prior. This means that if the
miner gives the transactions a normal looking fee, they will incur a cost
that will be paid to the sync flag. If the miner wants to avoid this, they
must give their stuffing transactions a zero fee, which provides evidence
that they are stuffing.
Also, when miners stuff with transactions using a zero fee, they cannot
manipulate the perception of how much fee it takes to get into a block.
Note that miners could still try to covertly stuff blocks that will pay a
sync flag that they themselves created. if this is a big concern, it can be
addressed by forcing blocks to pay multiple sync flags.
**Gives miners something to do while they wait for attractive transactions
to appear**
which worried that as the block subsidy reduced and transactions became a
more important fraction of miner revenue, it would be rational for miners
to turn off their mining equipment for a "gap" phase after a block is
found, to allow time to pass as more lucrative transactions entered the
I don't know whether this will actually happen. The presence of a suitable
backlog of transactions would help prevent this dynamic from emerging. But
if such idling behavior was the optima mining strategy, it could create a
serious vulnerability. Idle hands are the devil's workshop as the saying
goes, and idle miners represent a pool of inert hashpower that is available
to rent for all kinds of destabilizing purposes. It would be better to put
those miners to profitable work mining a sync flag while they wait.
Also, this creates a more efficient price discovery mechanism for
transactions, because you allow transactions paying high fees time to
arrive to the marketplace, rather than take whatever anyone is offering
because all the "good" transactions got gobbled up in the prior block.
**Can be easily done with a soft fork**
Although a hard fork would be more efficient, sync flags could be easily
implemented using a soft fork by introducing the following rule:
Every block must include a transaction which pays 25% of the block reward
to the address given by the 10th previous sync flag, and commits to the
hash of the 1st previous sync flag.

Two changes to the proposal (see repo for explanations)

2. Blocks now donate to 5 sync flags instead of 1
I also added comments about selfish mining and invalid block spam.
Response to replies:
tomz at freedommail.ch: What is the advantage over optimistic mining?
1. Sync flags can be somewhat smaller than block headers.
2. Sync flags improve variance by doubling the number of chances to win
3. Sync flags can be distinguished from normal blocks, so SPV clients can
ignore them as confirmations.
4. Sync flags reward all miners equally. Optimistic blocks have to be empty
unless you mined the previous block, which damages decentralization.
5. Sync flags result in fewer empty blocks, smoothing out resource usage
6. Sync flags make transaction stuffing by miners either obvious or costly
7. Sync flags give miners something to do while they wait for attractive
transactions to appear.
erik at q32.com: Flags will be selfish mined.
I agree that flags would likely be selfish mined. I have modified the
proposal to say that flags have the same POW target as blocks, so the
selfish mining vulnerability should be equal to the current protocol.
martijn.meijering at mevs.nl: Why expect more selfish mining?
Because flags had small POW relative to blocks. After you find a block, why
not hide it while you take a crack at the flag?

Not quite the same:
1. Sync flags can be somewhat smaller than block headers.
2. Sync flags can be distinguished from normal blocks, so SPV clients can
ignore them as confirmations.
3. Sync flags make transaction stuffing by miners either obvious or costly
4. No one pays for empty blocks, except for the block subsidy. Some miners
may choose to only mine the non-empty blocks, resulting in
hashpower-for-rent to make mischief or hashpower that oscillates, creating
a situation where empty blocks take longer to mine than full blocks.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Reasons to add sync flags to Bitcoin 
If there is concern about the
block-with-valid-header-but-invalid-transactions-spam-attack, I have a
strategy using sync flags that may drastically reduce the problem.
Sync flags documented here:
The strategy to defeat the above attack is illustrated here:
The key is to relax the requirement that a flag commit to a completely
valid block. The flag is valid if it commits to a valid block header, even
if the block body is invalid.
mining a flag the moment they obtain (or discover) a valid block header.
As soon as the spam is discovered, miners can choose to either abandon the
flag and return to mining on the previous block, or they can continue
mining on the flag.
It's difficult for me to game out which of these strategies would be
preferable. My first thought is that the miners should have the incentive
to mine whichever option has the fewest miners, which should result in a
50/50 split.
However, the miners who continue mining the flag have a chance of ending up
in a situation where they mine the flag before anyone mines a valid block.
If this happens, it is sub-optimal for them. They can start mining for the
next valid block but if someone else broadcasts a valid block header they
will be in the same pickle that miners under the current protocol are: they
must either keep mining for a valid block, or SPV mine the newly arrived
block while they do validation. The third option, of mining a flag, is not
available to them, because the flag has already been mined for this cycle.
As a result of the above, it may be most rational for miners to (upon
learning that they are mining a flag on top of an invalid block) split
their hashpower unevenly between the flag and continuing to mine for a
valid block. The hashpower split reflects their estimates of the cost of
the above negative outcome. I think the split would be pretty close to
50/50, but deviations from 50/50 would not necessarily be bad. For example,
if they split 52/48, with more hashpower toward finding the valid block
instead of the flag, then that decreases the likelyhood that the flag will
be discovered before the next valid block, which is good for all of the
miners. So it's a nice positive feedback.
This approach mostly neutralizes the harm done by the (currently very rare)
invalid block spam attack. As a kind of amazing side effect, the work done
to produce the spam is incorporated into the blockchain cumulative Proof of
Work, and the spammer is not paid for this contribution.

way to express the mass of a human, we might then find a group of people

I weigh 14 yoctoearths. This would be tidy, systematic and precise, but
that might not be enough to make it the best option. It might be even
better to choose a base unit that human intuition can make sense of, and

I dislike the name "bits" but I think 100 satoshis does make a nice base

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] An alternative way to protect the network from 
Here is the text of a post to reddit from Feb 2017, discussing a similar
idea, and wondering if it could reduce the incentive to delay broadcast of
solved blocks:
# How an anchored Proof of Stake Sidechain can help the Bitcoin main chain
# Steps:
1. Soft fork Bitcoin to enable side chains
2. Create a side chain that is secured with Proof of Stake. Call blocks on
this chain "POS-blocks." The original chain is made of "POW-blocks."
3. Side chain mints one POS-block after each POW-block on the main chain,
and contains the hash of the POW-block, and the hash of the previous
POS-block. See diagram [here.](
4. Side chain Minters must make a deposit in order to mint. If they mint an
invalid POS-block, they lose the deposit.
5. Side chain blocks are small enough to broadcast and validate quickly
(e.g. 100 - 300 KB).
6. Soft fork a new rule into Bitcoin that encourages POW-blocks to include
the hash of the prior POS-block. Specifically, penalize POW-blocks which do
not point to the prior POS-block by doubling the difficulty necessary for
them to be valid. Call POW-blocks which do not point to the prior POS-block
but are valid because of their very high POW "hard blocks."
In the following diagram POW2 and POW4 are valid because they point to the
prior POS-block and also satisfy the difficulty requirement. POW3 does not
point to the prior POS-bock, but is valid anyway because it contains proof
of work at twice the normal difficulty.
# Advantages:
1. Allow people who do not control ASICs to influence which transactions
2. Allow people who do not control ASICs to influence which chain gets
3. Reduce the incentive to selfish mine. Once a miner discovers a block,
they should broadcast it immediately in the hopes that a Minter will build
on it, because that is the most likely way their block will not go stale.
Miners will also immediately start trying to build a hard block. (Maybe
statistics could tell us what is the proper range for the Hardness
Multiplier. I guessed 2 would be good.)
4. Reduces the effective block interval while reducing the incidence of
stale blocks, empty blocks and SPV mining. After a POW-block is mined, it
is immediately broadcast to the network, seeking a qualified Minter to
extend it. Minters have a deposit, which they will lose if they mint an
invalid block. Pointing to the hash of an invalid POW-block would produce
an invalid minted block, so Minters have a strong incentive to completely
validate the POW-block before they mint on top of it. After validating,
they mint a block and broadcast it. While the Minter is validating the
previous POW-block, competing miners also have time to fully validate the
previous POW-block. By the time the Miners receive the POS-block, they know
what transactions they can and cannot include in their own block, because
the Minter only processes transactions on the side chain. There is less
reason to mine empty blocks, because there is adequate time to update the
mempool before mining the next soft block begins, and because hard blocks
take a long time to produce. The risks involved with mining on an
un-validated POS-block can be made small by the fact that there is a
deposit that will be destroyed if the POS-block is invalid. POS-blocks can
be validated quickly because they are small.
Here is a gantt chart of the schedule described above:
5. Unlike a pure POS system, a cabal of early Stake holders cannot cheaply
hatch an alternate history. Much less imperative for nodes to go to a
trusted peer and ask whether the chain they are being fed is legitimate.
6. After step 6 above, the side chain would have essentially the same
security characteristics as the main chain, and could be used
7. No hard fork required, and this soft fork could be deployed even if the
miners do not consent to it. Some hybrid POS system would be my
recommendation as preferable to simply changing POW algorithms in the face
of miners abusing their power.
8. Users can opt into the POS sidechain, and it can fully prove itself in
production before there is any attempt to anchor the main chain back to it.
Even if consensus cannot be obtained to execute step 6, the mere existence
of such a chain could deter tomfoolery on the part of POW miners, lest they
galvanize the community into throwing the switch.

transactions will profit from these transactions, whereas smaller and more

I think you are conflating 3 different (though overlapping) groups:
1. Block header generators. These need 'good internet' meaning very low
latency, reasonable bandwidth, good place in network (e.g. FIBRE or mining
backbone). They need reliable computers with enough RAM and CPU to validate
prior blocks promptly and immediately assemble new blocks.
2. Hashers. These need cheap electricity, access to economical uses of
waste heat, cheap mining hardware. e.g. IOT electric water heater.
3. ASIC manufacturers. These need lots of capital, etc.
It might be helpful to keep these three groups distinct in your mind and
conversation, and to use the protocol as a crowbar to pry them into
separate people, or at a minimum make it economically possible to
participate in one role without needing to participate in the other two. If
different, geographically and politically dispersed groups are helping
perform these functions, it aids decentralization.

I disagree. Changing the difficulty adjustment algorithm could improve the

and trading the tokens on the chain. This property could help keep the
price of the token high, which is what pressures hashpower to align with
user interests.
bitcoin chain dies from disuse after suffering a hashpower attack,
especially a centrally and/or purposefully instigated one, then bitcoin
would be failed a failed project.
IF the incentive problem could not be resolved then Bitcoin would be a
failed project.
But here is a bit of good news.
Bitcoin has developers!
And those developers can publish a contingency plan!
And that contingency plan can be an emergency hard fork to a different
retarget algorithm.
And that emergency hard fork can gain consensus if it is broadly preferred
over the status quo.
If 90% of the hash power follows NYA, blocks are going to take 100 minutes
until difficulty adjusts after 4.5 months.
That is quite a handicap, even for a honey badger. Emergency hard fork
carries a risk, but depending on the scenario in November, it could be a
risk worth taking.
One more thing. If miners think they are going to succeed in starving the
legacy chain to death, they might be more likely to try. If they get a
credible signal that the legacy chain will react by changing the retarget
function and thereby be more likely to survive, they might feel less
committed to a strategy of starving the legacy chain. This could be
especially true if they are giving up profit for what they fervently hope
will be a short period of time.

Or like keyart:
Images would definitely be quicker to verify by a human, but I don't think
humans can RELIABLY verify anything close to 25 bytes through an image.
Our visual processing system is designed wrong for this purpose, since it
subconsciously "corrects" visual input to whatever we expect to see.
It isn't enough to say that any small change produces a "significantly"
different image. What you need is for it to be (practically) impossible to
construct an image that looks similar but is wrong, which is a far higher
standard. For example, any change to a private key renders a significantly
different address -- but it is possible for an attacker to grind their way
to a similar-looking address.
I would recommend displaying 16 words in a 4 x 4 grid, but otherwise with
no visual distractions.
For example, don't provide an image next to the words as a help. Don't use
colors to differentiate two different sets of 16 words. What will happen is
people will see a pattern that triggers a sensation of familiarity, and
they will not carefully verify all of the words -- which is what security
For higher security keys, you could grind an address with enough zeros at
the beginning to be expressed by fewer words. For example, you could grind
to an address that could be fully expressed with a 12 word (4 x 3) grid
that would be easier for a human to verify reliably.

Clearly it is better for the miner if they know about C, because knowing
about C costs them nothing, but not knowing about C will sometimes result
in them earning less fees.
Clearly it is better for the people who are creating C for those
transactions to be mined instead of the more expensive A and B transactions.
Everyone else is better off in that more transactions would get included in
A concern about burdening full nodes with extra transactions to relay that
may not be more profitable to mine than the transactions they replace is
still rational -- though intuitively it seems like there would be a limit
on how many times an attacker could cheaply reorganize transactions into
something with a higher fee rate.
Perhaps there are also concerns with reconstruction of blocks from compact

benefit that, uh, grows over time. The thing I do not see people noticing
is that we actually pay little to no security price for this benefit.
To see this, consider Alice, who starts from a UTXO snapshot made at
current height - 50,000 and Bob who validates from genesis.
After her partial validation, Alice is satisfied that she is in possession
of the UTXO set-- she is in consensus with the rest of the network peers.
However, Bob realizes that there is actually an invalid block at current
height - 50,001.
Three things to notice:
1. This scenario essentially cannot happen. There is no way that the miners
are going to stack 50,000 blocks on top of an invalid block without the
economic majority abandoning the invalid chain.
2. If this scenario DOES happen, Bob has learned about it too late for it
to matter to Bob. The blockchain Bob wants to be on is the one that
everyone has been using for the last year, whether or not it is besmirched
by an invalid block.
3. If this scenario DOES happen, and Bob DOES want to reject the last
50,000 mined blocks as invalid, he may discover to his dismay that in the 1
year since the invalid block, mischievous entities have enough time to mine
equally weighted alternative histories from the Genesis block forward to
the invalid block, meaning that Bob has no way to use POW to come to
consensus with other Bobs out there.

real IBD. There are HUGE security implications for this.
This is a perfect example of what I am talking about when I say that people
do not appear to notice that there is no important security implication to
be found here.
If there are huge security implications for this, then I am keen to hear
them. In the scenario I have described, what advantage does Bob have over
Alice? What actionable information has Bob gained, and what is the action
he can take with it in hand? What value does Bob receive in return for the
electricity he has spent validating the previous blocks? I cannot find any,
but I am open to hearing the answer, and I think others would benefit from
knowing it as well.

And then make UTXOs containing OP_CODESEAPRATOR (etc.) and mined prior to
the soft fork activation standard, with weight penalties as appropriate, so
there would be no difficulty spending them before the cutoff?
