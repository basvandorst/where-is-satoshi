to defend itself against attacks of any form.
Agree 100%. Plus yeah, lotsa luck getting any success via those channels...
But assuming the answer to the perceived problem is to ?fight fire with
fire? (using social / marketing based efforts) who ?should? pick up the
mantle here? Without inciting riots by asking the question, wouldn?t that
ostensibly be something the Bitcoin Foundation would lead on here? In any case, it?s frustrating to watch the ongoing FUD and scammery going
unanswered in any ?official? capacity.

If I'm understanding the problem being stated correctly:
"Bitcoin is under a branding attack by fork coins."
The proposed solution is to disincentivize fork coins from using the word
Bitcoin by altering the license terms. I'm not a lawyer, but it seems to me
that the words of the license are basically useless unless there is an
entity that intends to make use of court systems to threaten noncompliant
projects into submission.
In my opinion, the perceived attack on Bitcoin here is social /
marketing-based, thus it makes sense that any defense against said attack
should also be social / marketing-based. I don't think that Bitcoin should
be reliant upon courts or governments to defend itself against attacks of
any form.

Somewhat related question -
In the interest of avoiding running multiple bitcoind full nodes - is there
a method to allow a Lightning node to point to / access a separate
already-existing node, vs. requiring it to have its own dedicated local
instance of bitcoind running?
I.e. if I already have a full bitcoin node running, could I use RPC calls
or something to tell my Lightning node to use that node, instead of
spinning up *another* full node? I?m currently minimizing the network
thrashing by whitelisting my LN bitcoind node to only point to my existing
full node for updates, but if I could just point my whole LN node at it,
that?s save on disk storage etc. etc. etc.
Apologies if this is already in there (or has been added) and I missed it
because I haven?t kept up with release notes?

Kulpreet Singh via bitcoin-dev Yes, Lightning nodes need to monitor the network for transactions that
they need to react to. This is basically tailing the blockchain and
looking for anything suspicious. The `bitcoind` sitting next to the
lightning node however does not need to keep an index of the
transactions, at least for c-lightning, because we just ask for the full
block that then gets scanned for transactions of interest and then we
discard the rest of the block. We never ask for a specific transaction
from `bitcoind` and therefore we don't need to run with `-txindex`.
Pruned nodes should work, as long as the current blockchain head that
the lightning node has seen does not fall into the pruned range, since
in that case it won't be able to fetch and process the blocks anymore.
I don't think we should ever require `-txindex` to run a lightning node
(I know some implementations did in the past), since that'd be a very
onerous requirement to run a lightning node. Tailing the blockchain is
more than sufficient to get the necessary data, and hopefully we can get
our reliance on `bitcoind` down to a minimum in the future.
Absolutely no problem, it is a common misconception that `-txindex` is
required to run a lightning node in all cases :-)

Resolved -> RTFM
Worked like a champ, first try. Thanks! Wish I had thought to look into that sooner! My c-lightning node?s resource footprint is even smaller now. Unfairly small.
And now that I?ve unexpectedly regained ~180 GB worth of free SSD space from not having that extra full node, I?m feeling wealthy. Accordingly, I?m off to squander my newfound riches over at satoshis?s place. )
