Where is my "Bitcoin Address" within this new QT version?
 The windows appear but, I can't find my bitcoin address.

Testing the 0.5.0 in Linux, I see a strange behaviour:
 1- Open qt-client, blockchain stops the downloading at 10%... Wait 30
minutes... not reach 11%...
 2- Close and reopen the qt-client, blockchain start again at 0%... Normal!?
 3- Now the download of the blockchain is working, reach 15% and growing...
 I have a open firewall for the Bitcoin protocol. My 0.4.0 client works
just fine, with more than 30 connections at the same machine (but another
Linux user).
 Also, where can I find the number of connections using new Bitcoin-QT?

The bidcoin-qt for Linux does not have the Bitcoin icon at the Desktop
Pager (Ubuntu Oneiric 11.10).
 This is a cosmetic change.

I try to reproduce the error by doing this (Ubuntu 11.10 64bits):
 rm -rf ~/bitcoin # CAUTION
 ./bitcoin-0.4.0-linux/bin/64/bitcoin
 * Encrypt my wallet
 * Close Bitcoin 0.4.0
 Next open Bitcoin 0.5.0rc7:
 ./bitcoin-0.5.0rc7-linux/bin/64/bitcoin-qt
 * Automatic wallet upgrade (I guess) working... No crashs...

Hi everybody!!
 This is my first message here... I'm ThiagoCMC at bitcointalk...
 Well, one of the features that I like most is that, every time I receive
some Bitcoin amount, a new address appear at my "AddressBook"automatically,
AND, I like to track it.
 This feature is broken at 0.3.24 but it is working again! Thanks BTW!!
 But, I've read in some places that you guys are thinking in disable this
feature... Is that true?!
 PLEASE, do NOT deactivate this feature! I mean, do not deactivate ANY
feature. Instead of, just add a option to turn it ON and OFF. Right?!  ^^
 Bitcoin is the most amazing project since Linux and Git!!  :-P
 Thank you guys!!

Hi John!
 Thank you for your answer...
 I have "two kinds" of address, the "static address", which I created myself
for any personal reason, and the "dinamic address", which is the automatic
generated address when I receive some Bitcoin amount, I label each one (the
automatic created by the software) with something like "DINAMIC-1",
"DINAMIC-2" and so on...
 I use my "dinamic address" in a "random" way, following the moon phase...
 My point is: I like to keep track of all my Bitcoin Address, they are all
 Please, leave this feature alive, as a option, disabled by default.
 I don't know why people fear about their own address... It is all under
"Receiving" tab! There is nothing to fear about it.
 ---
 BTW, I think this option should have some explanations at the "Options
screen", for example:
 For increasing your anonymity, enable the "Dinamic Bitcoin Address" option
and make sure to always use one new and different address for each
transaction. And do not link each address with your person!
 (X) Dynamic Bitcoin Address (a new Bitcoin Address will be created
automatically for you, after each new received Bitcoin amount)
 ---
 Thank you so much!

Only for the record, I'll integrate BitcoinJS (app) into Diaspora and, the
server side will be based on libcoin!
 Of course, this code will be part of Diaspora and every single Diaspora*
Pod will be able to host its own users's wallets...  ;-)
 I appreciate any help during this development!

Hi Michael!
 Thank you for libcoin! It is a awesome evolution for Bitcoin and for the
CryptoCurrencies as a hole... Thanks!!!
 Anyway, I am unable to compile libcoin under my Ubuntu 11.04. At this
machine, I have compiled and running Bitcoin (from sources), Namecoin,
Devcoin, Litecoin, IXcoin and I0coin, all from sources but, when I try to
compile libcoin, I got:
user at desk:~/libcoin$ ./configure

Hi Michael,
 Thank you for your attention!
 Now, I'm trying to start libcoin's bitcoind using high ports but, it
always try to listen at 8332, no matter what I "say"...
 Look:
$ cat .bitcoin/bitcoin.conf
 But:
Error: Address already in use
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'DbException'
  what():  DbEnv::close: Invalid argument
 When I "strace it", I can see:
bind(12, {sa_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(8333),
sin_addr=inet_addr("0.0.0.0")}, 16) = -1 EADDRINUSE (Address already in use)
 I already tried:
 Without success...
Thanks again!

Hi Michael!
 I would like to ask you one thing:
 1- Release a new version of Libcoin closest as possible with mainline
 I mean, do not add any extra code to it and also, do not change any stdout
 How much do you think that this will cost?
 For the extra code: I'll need to run the "blockchain side" as Linux user
called "blockchain" and, each of my regular Linux user will have its own
wallet.dat file (without the blockchain).

Hi Michael,
 NOTE: Re-add bitcoin-dev to this thread on Cc...
 I'll test this ASAP! I REALLY need this feature (blockchain server <->
wallet client).
 I just want ask you some things...
 1- How close is Libcoin with original Bitcoin? I mean, the output is a
little different, the bitcoind help output was disabled and, I'm afraid
that Libcoin can possibly being distant from Bitcoin in the future... That
can happen?!
 2- Do you have plans to update Libcoin on every new upstream Bitcoin
release? How fast will be this updates? Do you need more resources/people
working on it?
 Another questions not involved directly with Libcoin/Bitcoin but, I'll
need it for my future Bitcoin projects, and Libcoin is on my radar:
 1- Do you know about Diaspora* Project?
 2- Do you have skills in Ruby on Rails development?
Thank you!

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Announcement: libcoin 
Since libcoin is "chain agnostic", I was wondering if the project can be
used like this:
 When I install it with "make install", I would like to have something like
 Regular file: /usr/local/bin/libcoincore # or whatever you like
 Symlink -> Regular file
 /usr/local/bit/bitcoind ->  /usr/local/bin/libcoincore  # bitcoind is a
symlink to libcoincore
 /usr/local/bit/litecoind ->  /usr/local/bin/libcoincore  # litecoind is a
symlink to libcoincore
 /usr/local/bit/devcoind ->  /usr/local/bin/libcoincore  # devcoind is a
symlink to libcoincore
 /usr/local/bit/namecoind ->  /usr/local/bin/libcoincore  # devcoind is a
symlink to libcoincore
 ...and so on...
 So, libcoincore will interpret the ARGV[0] and, for each string, it will
initiate the appropriate internal functions...
 I don't know if Libcoin already does something like that... I'm not a
developer/code reader... Just a small nerd with big ideas...  ^_^

Hi Michael,
 Let's talk a little bit more about this awesome stuff!
2012/3/22 Michael Gr?nager Well, +1000 for that!! Since bitcoin-qt and bitcoind binaries share a lot
of functions... There is a need for some kind of library, right?! So, both
(and even more apps) can use it!  :)
 I'll try to help you here... One thing that I like to try and announce is:
 Use P2Pool with libcoin instead Bitcoin! BUT, to that work, libcoin must
behave EXACTLY like Bitcoin 0.6.0rc5 (at least).
 If it works, I'll update my P2Pool guide here:
 A Complete Guide to P2Pool - Merged Mining (BTC/NMC/DVC/IXC/I0C) plus LTC,
  I think that this will bring much more eyes to Libcoin!! Don't you think?!
 Let's do it?!?!
COOL!! I just finish my Diaspora test environment, can you try it?!
Too bad... lol
My plan with Diaspora is to include a wallet for each user and, Libcoin
sound perfect for it.
If I use original bitcoind, each Diaspora user will consumes a lot of
resources and I'll need to build a private cloud computing for running
user's wallets more safely...
You know when you log into Diaspora and there is a Cubbi.es app for it?!
So, the same way Cubbi.es manages/shows your pictures within Diaspora, my
(our) application will manage our Bitcoins!! And users will be able to
send/sell Bitcoins between them (maybe integrating it with Bitcoin-OTC will
be a good idea for the future)...
