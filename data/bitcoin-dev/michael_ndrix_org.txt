@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Release candidates: versions 0.4.1 and 0.5 
2011/11/17 Martinx - ????? I've noticed this same behavior with 0.5 release candidates.  I remember
seeing it with 0.4 also, so I think it's not a regression.  I haven't yet
pinned down the cause.  It would be nice to fix; especially for those
downloading the blockchain for the first time.
 Also, where can I find the number of connections using new Bitcoin-QT?
Hover over the signal icon in the lower right corner.  The icon looks like
a cellphone signal indicator.  The number of connections is displayed in a

Are there current users of gettransaction for whom the performance penalty

I think this is a great change for IPv4 too.  On certain machines with
slow IO, I routinely delete the address database before starting
bitcoind to improve load times.
I've started a couple patches with a similar design, but not produced
anything I'm happy with.  That work has persuaded me that this
architecture is a valuable improvement over what we have today.
If the Bitcoin client has multiple peer discovery methods enabled
(IRC, DNS, seed nodes, etc), it might be wise to guarantee that at
least one peer is selected via each method.  This requires a Sybil
attacker to control all peer discovery methods for a successful
Cool design.  It seems resilient to many attacks.  A Sybil attack
coming from a large botnet (which controls addresses in many ranges)
can still fill all buckets in both tables, I think.  As far as I can
tell, that wasn't possible with the old design.

The randomness prevents finely crafted attacks since an attacker can't
predict which bucket his address ends up in.  I don't think it helps
against brute force attacks though.  If 60% of the network's nodes are
controlled by an evil botnet, 60% of the nodes we pull out of the
address manager point to the attacker.  If a client has 8 connections
to the network, a Sybil attack would succeed 1.7% of the time.  At
current network size, 60% of listening nodes is 2,800; only 2-5% of a
decent botnet.
Nodes that accept incoming connections are far less vulnerable, since
the probability of success decreases exponentially with the number of
connections.  95% botnet control with 125 connections has 10^-6 chance
of success.
Perhaps we could add a command-line option for increasing the maximum
number of outbound connections.  That way, nodes unable to accept
incoming connections can easily decrease their susceptibility to Sybil
I think it should be disabled by default one release after the new
address manager is released.  That way, we're not changing too many
parts of the bootstrapping process at once.
As an aside, I can't help but wonder whether ISPs blocking IRC traffic
filters some botnets out of the IRC bootstrapping channels; keeping
them more "pure".

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] CAddrMan: Stochastic IP address manager 
I think I've explained myself poorly.  On my nodes, the old address
database routinely has 120k addresses.  With the new address manager,
it will have 20k addresses.  Filling the former with 60% evil nodes
requires 72,000 evil nodes; while the latter requires 12,000.
As I mentioned in my first post, I think the new address manager "is a
valuable improvement over what we have today".  I think it should be
included in the next release.
I also think we should be aware that we're making it somewhat easier
to isolate outbound-only nodes.  A single listening node can support
15 non-listening nodes (125/8).  The network currently has 5
non-listening nodes for every listening node.  That ratio has stayed
quite stable, so I think we have wiggle room if we wanted to allow
more outbound connections in some circumstances.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] HTTP REST API for bitcoind 
+1 and thank you. I've prototyped a couple different Bitcoin projects that
would benefit from this.
I'm traveling with poor 'net so I haven't read the patches yet. I echo pull
request comments about using Accept and Accept-Encoding headers. Same for
an API version number in the URL.
It'd be helpful, eventually, to have APIs corresponding to Bitcoin addr and
version messages.  Metadata about the network and the peer, respectively,
are valuable in my use cases.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] HTTP REST API for bitcoind 
We already have a good private HTTP interface.  Most benefits of this REST
interface come from exposing it publicly.  As always, the challenge is
balancing costs and benefits.  I'm not confident that either can be known
with certainty until a well-written prototype is running in the wild.  As
some nodes expose this interface, we'll gain concrete experience from which
node operators can make informed security trade offs.
