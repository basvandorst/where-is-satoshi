Hash: SHA512
Hello all,
BitPay has just released our first whitepaper on ChainDB, a new
peer-to-peer database system backed by the Bitcoin blockchain.  This
paper outlines our intended consensus mechanism, proof of fee.
Please take a look at the paper here: We are seeking comments and feedback on this mechanism.  I am happy to
answer any questions about the paper itself.
