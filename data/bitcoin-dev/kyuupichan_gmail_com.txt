@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Fwd: death by halving 
Economically a halving is almost the same as a halving in price (as fees
take up more of the pie, less so).
Coincidentally the price has halved since early July to mid-October, and
we've not even seen difficulty fall yet.
I don't think there's much to see here.
