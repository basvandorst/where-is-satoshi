I am proposing to create a AML-KYC module to control the network and also
qualify use cases in OFAC compliant way.
Here is the attached doc.
Please provide your feedback and suggestions.

Thanks for the comments and feedback.
I have previously read those threads as suggested by some members.
In relation with transactions, I do agree with suggestions that they should
be left on their own, and assumed that people would work in the  best
interest of themselves and society. Everything is debatable, but let's
agree with it.
But for miners, I can think of no other option to stop those who are
hashing and winning blocks+transaction fees and not in safe country
list(directly or indirectly).
Some have asked for proofs, but that is tough to substantiate. I have
hints, honestly.
Would you sit idle if Haqqani network is funded by bitcoin mining?
We have created a billion dollar market by bitcoin and ,sadly, for everyone
without borders. Sick, I am saying this, but freedom is more of
responsibility than celebrations of open hugs. And those who don't care
about it are threat for you and us, equally.
Folks, suggest something, scrap my idea, but let's build something to save
this ecosystem, otherwise it is impossible to realise this dream of
decentralized currency. Other coins and protocols are there who may
implement something, and egoists always meet the ashes.
Criticize with open mind.

Fine point.
So where is the solution? What to do?

So you mean that,
   1. Govt agencies already know about everything and anything this subject
   is about, but passively.
   2. Due to passive nature, the actions are post incident and not pre. So
   there is a risk of many ticking time-bombs which some JB (Jack Bauer or
   James Bond or Jai Singh Rathore) would diffuse. Sorry for being dramatic,
   the purpose is to make the point, and nothing else.
   3. The subjected proposal doesn't breach the decentralisation, but just
   not like swiss democracy.
I am not a legal expert, but know this much that there are 2 kinds of
crimes, one against liberty and other against life. Most of online privacy
advocacy is for liberty. But money is attached to life and not liberty. So
this has to change. It means life for many and many depend on it.
And the appeal is, Let us get active.
PS: I do not own much of bitcoins to be an advocate, but many others do and
any mayhem would affect me somehow, even if in farthest of world.

Thanks for nice decentralized discussion.
This wasn't and isn't a parody.
Mining is insecure (for society) and security is passive.
All the raised points are proven by esteemed members themselves.
Closing from my side.
God Bless,
