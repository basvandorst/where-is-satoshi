@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Serialised P2SH HD chains 
Eric Lombrozo is doing work similar to that. You may wish to connect.
He's building a BIP to standardize a multisig application of BIP32.
Like there are xprv and xpubs for single keychains, he is developing a similar construct that would embed all information necessary for a "multisig xpub" (total keychains in system, minimum # of keys required, and which derivation paths on each keychain are to be combined to make the resultant multisig wallet)
The result would be taking an xpub style string and piping it through a BIP32-like algorithm to pop off P2SH addresses in a deterministic order, just like BIP32 pops off standard addresses in deterministic order.
I will ping Eric to connect with you in case the both of you are working on something similar and you can help each other.
