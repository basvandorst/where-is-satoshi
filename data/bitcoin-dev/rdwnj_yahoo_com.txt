[Aside: When replying to the digest, please try to trim it]
It appears that we will soon be at a hashrate where all the desktop
CPUs in the world couldn't really make a dent in it... certainly not
desktop cpus using the slow integrated cpu miner, which is much slower
than external optimized cpu miners.
But this is why I suggest packaging up a modern mining tool that
supports CPU/GPU/FPGA/ASIC mining against a current bitcoind. Doing so
would reduce the difference between testnet and mainnet, and provide
an actually useful tool for contributing directly.
Though again, I note, that Jeff's patch doesn't actually remove the
integrated miner (I think it should?).? Just the getwork support for
external miners which don't use getblocktemplate... and if you're
going to download one of those you could go download bfgminer instead.

Here, too. If I'm too impatient to wait for the next block that is.
I think it'd be a pity if the easy way to mine blocks would be removed.
My comments start here.
I agree with Andreas. The mining code in bitcoind & qt is not so hard to improve and even use, such as it is. I am sorry to say that using bfgminer is one big, complicated install, on Windows at least, AFAICT from looking at the github code bfgminer-2.10.11.zip. Seems much more work than I had bringing up bitcoind/qt from the "ground up" on my Windows machine. And the mining code is only a small part of the end of main.cpp .
I don't see it harming the rest of the code when I run it in the daemon or Qt.
Can't one mine "from a distance" using the RPC interface now anyway, even with the code still there?
I assume that you all would like to have a "seething horde" of new Windows users running and using bitcoin? I know that I sure am trying to make that happen. I think an integrated, wallet, miner, full node on the net (which I presume bitcoind/bitcoin-qt are) is the first step, and maybe should always exist? Though other variations could exist too. Could even be a compile Define, like USE_PNP for example, to strip off this or that?
So for me, if I want to mine, just because my solar powered laptop has some free cpu cycles, I don't mind having a "snow ball's chance in hell" of solving the "next" block. At ~0.5 MHPS on my CPU it takes me ~2.5 hours to go through all (2^32)-1 nonces for a tentative new block, with a particular set of transactions. I only can get "deep" into the nonces when one of those +30 minute blocks comes by! And they do from time to time.
I think forcing users to have two computers to mine, or run two programs,? is "pushing it" so to speak? And do I also see some wallet removal code being conjured up on git hub?
I think the beauty that is Satoshi's original bitcoin idea should be kept, together in one package. If the code was properly commented, formatted, organized , etc.etc., which I understand is "postponed" when one is "in the zone" writing code, then I think separating the wallet code or mining code, ought to be much easier. I feel that the dirty task of at least "calling things by their right names" (as said in the Chinese proverb) should be done first. As an example calling the main Berkeley database environment class instance of the wallet an abbreviated 5 lower case letter cryptic "bitdb" reminds me of the time when ram and disc storage were "dear" and compilers couldn't handle "long" names! I would call it something much grander! Only 46 places to change ! Also the member DbEnv dbenv is equally underplayed as it is the main actor in the play! Let's not even mention pdb being used both for a BerkeleyDB? CDB.Db* and as an albeit private leveldb DB*.!
Pointers that aren't called pSomething, un-commented/un-documented magic numbers where commented constants should be, and on and on it goes.
So I just sit back doing the clean up on 0.8.1, then .0.8.2, now 0.8.3 while you architects march ahead oblivious to the cryptic minefield of code that exists underneath :) My aim is to first clean up the code enough so that I can understand it. Then eventually, take it over to a real Windows project/solution where it can be made into an executable that is palatable for the masses.
Getting off soapbox now and retreating to the back...(bitcointalk.org that is)

??? There is some consensus that when the internal miner is to be removed, a
simple miner should be packaged with the main repository as separate
program (the "reference miner"?). The only change is that it does no longer
need to burden the core code
(see also the discussion here: I see no burden to the code when it is not mining, if that is what you mean by
burden. The miner code's hashes/sec are a function of how much CPU time it gets. When I am gcc compiling, I see the hashes/sec drop, but bitcoind keeps up easily side by side with  latest transactions and new blocks. And I only have a single core AMD Athlon 1.8GHz cpu.
I would hate to admit how many browser windows and tabs I have open too,
and an IDE (LOL)!I will admit that I have modified the miner code a little, ?to use (potentially) every allowable nonce and to check for a new block in a timed fashion and be less aggressive, 8 bytes of 0 instead of 4, in checking for a potential solution.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Modularizing Bitcoin 
One of the primary upcoming priorities for bitcoin?s infrastructure, beyond the bloom filter, will be the continued modularization of the system.
Here at the Bitcoin Grant, we would like to jump start this development with a financial incentive and initiate an ongoing conversation on how we can work together towards developing a smarter, more efficient system of tomorrow, today.
Up for grabs: 500 bitcoins or $500,000; whichever is greater.
Taking on a project of this scope is a highly intensive, technical undertaking and we believe excellent developers should be compensated as such, especially when it comes to open source projects.
One of the main goals will be to separate the wallet from the node, as we have already done with mining. This way, the wallet, which will only hold private keys and create transactions, would pass transactions directly to a relay node, based on the bloom filter. Meanwhile, the block node will maintain the block chain and validate and relay new blocks.
Such developments would significantly strengthen the system. Modularization would make cancer attacks less likely and increase the node count, which, currently, is fairly low.
This is by no means is a feature request, merely ideas as to initiate a discussion. We welcome any feedback or suggestions. And of course, let us know if you would like to contribute to this project by submiting a grant proposal.
 I don't know if this is the proper method of replying or even if I am allowed to reply!
Modularization can have many meanings, depending upon one's past! The code is somewhat compartmentalized/modularized now. But if one forces complete separation of the parts, with a 'loose coupling', etc., I find that the performance tends to suffer and the size increases. In the Java world there is the notion of refactoring one's code. This would be too much, I think, in this case. When I developed with a team and alone, I would make what used to be called 'step-wise refinements' on existing working code. To me, one of things this meant was doing a one to one transformation of the source code, in such a way as to have the identical, byte for byte, executable file, but a 'better' set of source files. A similar process would seem appropriate here. Especially since there is much in the code that I don't understand :) As to 'separating the wallet from the node', do you mean allowing the wallet.dat file to be anywhere, and not restricted to the 'OS default' or 'datadir' directory? If so, I have done that with no change to the current behavior, and also the wallet.dat now can have any legal filename too! I haven't tested it yet on bitcoin-qt, but it runs on bitcoind. I am still 'ramping up' on github to get the code into view. After testing on bitcoin-qt of course.
What may I ask, is a cancer attack?
If any of this inappropriate, forgive me.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] on CDB::Rewrite() 
I only bring this up here since I can't raise  Perhaps it runs on the silk road servers:)
Upon looking at the 0.8.5 & earlier code for CDB:Rewrite(), in the files db.h and db.cpp, you will notice that in db.h it is declared bool static, but in db.cpp it isn't. Is this a problem? Or a feature? Or nothing at all?
Furthermore, it is called only in wallet.cpp -->CWallet::EncryptWallet() but its return value is ignored? Again, intentional or a bug or a feature or a ...?
Now CWallet::EncryptWallet() is called by AskPassphraseDialog::accept() and WalletModel::setWalletEncrypted()and they seem very interested in what? CWallet::EncryptWallet() returns. Could this be involved in some old issue with wallet encryption on bitcoin-qt 0.8.1?
There seems to be plenty of this kind of "suspicious" code to ferret about in, with one's IDE during quiet moments. Amusing is to follow return 0 and return 1 to try and infer their meaning, their intent?

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] locks and directories 
Is it required, presumed, assumed, coincidence, chance or irrelevant that the three different databases in bitcoin:
1. the network addresses database, reflected in peers.dat
2. the levelDB block chain database (blocks/blknnnnn.dat, blocks/revnnnnn.dat, blocks/index/nnnnn.sst et al, chainstate/nnnnn.sst et al)
3. the Berkeley DB wallet database (db.log, wallet.dat, database/log.nnnnnnnnn1)
are all in the "datadir" directory?
I only ask since it would seem that a more mature (?) bitcoind or bitcoin-qt would optionally, like the three (databases) in separate paths or drives, etc. It would seem easier to transport, backup etc. the pieces one wants. I find the block chain database is the most important (time consuming), because of its size, to duplicate and transport in order to backup. This also attacks the "Criticism" section in The first question is: can one backup by just looking at the dates, and just back up those files with the equal or newer dates, and the "log, current and manifest" files? An initial then incremental backups, as it were.
I am thinking of the frailties of data on OS's such as Windows in the hands of the "less than adept" shall we say. Also if one takes part in backing up one's data, one may actually have some idea where it is!

Not to get snarky or OS elitist but as I understand it windows security,
even during its support period has been measured in low digit number of days
in the year when is NOT an outstanding known remote root compromise or
combination of remote user compromise + priviledge escalation.? Add in
phishing, watering holes, malware and the average windows computer is
probably compromised a dozen times over.? Apparently for sometime it was not
easily possible to secure it install boot - install OS, connect to network
to download security updates, IP range scanned and compromised faster than
you can patch it.
The trick was to install off line, add your own (free or commercial s/w firewall) then connect, behind a router that had no port forwarding, etc.? Hell before cheap routers I ran one Win95B as I remember, using ICS to a hub that feed my LAN and in front was a dialup and a cable modem.? Atguard was the S/W firewall, worked great and never was penetrated.
And if one used IE for anything, or any form of Outlook one was and still is a fool. There are still fools who think that their Windows Vista, 7, 8 or 8.1 is safe because MS updates it days, weeks or longer after an exploit is found/exposed/known... And
they feel that they can install and run anything anyone says is OK?? No firewall can protect against shall we say digital naivety. Ah what fools these mortals be.? Then there are others that have never used IE, never installed/enabled Outlook, never enabled UPNP &/or, DCOM; never executed "unknown" s/w, and always had their own s/w firewall on, long before MS even thought of "Windows Firewall".? Does anyone (other than zone alarm) check for data leaving one's computer "unexpectedely"?? Those machines could run Win95B, Win98SE, NT4, Win2K, XP pro long past MS's "cut off date" and barely notice
anything. The show stopper is usually the browser (FF) or Adobe flash or pdf demanding more OS functions, usually so that they can perform more functions more poorly, I'm sorry to say.

??? Nice work, but please don't call it the "Bitcoin protocol spec". Your
document is not a spec. It is an attempt to describe in English the Bitcoin
protocol, but anyone who implemented it based on your description would get
it wrong. For example you didn't mention the SIGHASH_SINGLE bug and many
other important areas like the difficulty transitions are also left
As a loose description of the protocol for newbies it's an invaluable
resource and perhaps we should link to it from the developer guide. As
something that claims to be a specification it is quite possibly dangerous
- the only spec that matters is the C++ original.
Hello Mike,
What C++ original might that be?? Version 0.1.0? 0.9.x? 0.8.6?? And what parts of which version?

 Yes, check macros like that can be useful.
 I like the kernel's policy, which parallels our direction:
 1) Enable and use lightweight assertions for most users.
 2) No assertions with side effects
 If you want to compile them out, that's fine, but they
 should always
 be present in production software.
 _____________________________________________________
I don't think many of you actually read what I said, and you went off on your own tangents.
I said:
this commit and code with all side effects removed from the assertions.
in Vol 37, Issue 4
I intentionally left the gcc code alone.  Only the MSC code is assert "fixed".  I would have hoped that someone would have noticed and incorporated these changes into the gcc code.  Simply by removing the  _MSC_VER ...  ...   etc. etc.  Did I say I compiled them out? No!  Did anyone bother to look at my code or what I said?
Here is an example from main.cpp  CTransaction::UpdateCoins(...
-    // add outputs
+    // add outputs      sure looks like an assert with side effects here!?
+ _MSC_VER
+    bool
+        fTest = inputs.SetCoins(txhash, CCoins(*this, nHeight));
+     _DEBUG
+        assert(fTest);
+    +    if( !fTest )
+        releaseModeAssertionfailure( __FILE__, __LINE__, __PRETTY_FUNCTION__ );
+         assert(inputs.SetCoins(txhash, CCoins(*this, nHeight)));
Note that I do the test, and if debugging, I let it abort() the program if it fails.  Note that in release mode it calls a new function on failure, that I leave you to discover what it does.  I see that this assert has been "fixed" in 0.9.x, but I think my "fix" is better, since it allows release mode code to run better, if not identically.
I changed every assert() in the bitcoind 086 sources to behave this way.  Since C++ is perniciously baroque, it is not clear if a side effect can or has occurred in the most innocuous of C++ statements. Is the example above side-effect free?
Here is a piece of what I made my decision on:
 and the link to the book previously given.
Also, no one answered the question about bitcoin-qt, to whit, can or should it be compiled in RELEASE mode because of this?  Should it have always been compiled in DEBUG mode in the past too?

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] alternatives to the 20MB block limit, 
Hello all,
With all the discussion about the Block size limit, I thought it would be interesting to measure, in some sense, the average Tx size.? Then given a fixed average block period (Bp) of 10 minutes (i.e 600 seconds), all one needs to do to estimate an average block size is ask the question: what average transaction rate (tps) do you want?
So for tps ~ 10 (Tx/sec) and an average transaction size (avgTxSz) of 612 Bytes (last ten blocks up to block 357998 (2:05pm EDT 5/25/2015) we have a block size of 612 * 10 * 600 = 3,672,000 Bytes
Alternatively, given an avgTxSz ~612 and maxBl = 1,000,000 we have (maxBl / avgBlSz) / Bp is the actual current max tps, which is ~2.72 tps.
The avgBlSz for the 10 blocks up to block # 357999 is ~ 576 Bytes, so the current possible tps is ~2.89 and the maxBL for a tps = 10 is 3,456,000 bytes.
So I think one should state one's assumed tps and a measured or presumed avgTxSz before saying what a maxBl should be. So for a maxBl ~20,000,000 Bytes and a current avgTxSz ~600 Bytes, the tps ~55.5 FWIW
