I would like to propose bip48 (taking bip44 as inspiration), with the purpose of documenting modern multi-sig derivations.
Please see a rough draft of the proposed bip attached, comments/input welcome.

Hi Luke,
It looks to have the same motivations and be compatible with  (if I am reading it correctly).
The only guidance I have on proposing a bip is what is on the readme 48 would be fitting if it is unused.
This is still very much a work in progress and there does seem to be community support.
Pavol and others have shared relevant info/suggestions which I will be using to update the proposal.
Will share again here when the next draft is ready.
Many thanks,
