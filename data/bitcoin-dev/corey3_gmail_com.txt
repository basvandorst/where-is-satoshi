I agree on the importance of having the credible threat of being able to
operate in the underground, and for the reasons you outlined.  However, I
see that threat as being inherent in the now-public-knowledge that a system
like Bitcoin can exist.  The smart governments already know that
Bitcoin-like systems are unstoppable phenomena, that they can operate over
Tor and I2P, that they can and do run without central servers, and that
they can be run on commodity hardware without detection.  Bitcoin itself
does not need to constantly operate in survival-mode, hunkered down, and
always ready for big brother?s onslaught, to benefit from the protection of
the ?credible threat?.
It?s important to accurately asses the level of threat the Bitcoin system
faces from regulation, legislation, and government ?operations?.  If we are
too paranoid, we are going to waste resources or forgo opportunities in the
name of, essentially, baseless fear.  When I got involved with this project
in 2012, no one really knew how governments were going to react.  Had an
all out war-on-Bitcoin been declared, I think it?s pretty safe to say the
structure of the network would look different than it does today.  We would
probably be discussing ways to disguise Bitcoin traffic to look like VoIP
calls, not talking about how to best scale the network.  In light of the
current regulatory climate surrounding Bitcoin, I believe the best security
against a state-sponsored / political crackdown to be gained at this time
comes from growing the user base and use cases, as opposed to hardening and
fortifying the protocol.  Uber is a great example of this form of
security-though-adoption, as was mentioned earlier today on this mailing
If there are security or network-hardening measures that don?t come at the
expense of growing the user base and use cases, then there is no reason not
to adopt them.  The recent improvements in Tor routing are a great example
of a security improvement that in no meaningful way slows Bitcoin?s
potential growth.  How does this relate to the Blocksize debate?  Let?s
accept that 8 MB blocks might cause a little bit, and perhaps even a
?medium bit? (however that is measured), of centralization.  Although the
network might be slightly more vulnerable to government attack, if millions
more people are able to join the system as a result, I?d wager the overall
security situation would be stronger, owning to greatly decreased risk of

A planned hardfork, similar to certain softforks, leaves users with some
reduction in security.  It does not leave them defenseless.  Consider the
1: Hard to be robbed on the basis of hashpower.
In reality the old chain will see mining all but stop, and blocks would be
hours to days apart even if a couple percentage points of hashpower failed
to switch over.  Six confirmations would certainly take days.  If the fork
can be scheduled at the beginning of a difficulty period, the old chain
would almost certainly not even ever make it to the next retargeting.
2: Hard to be robber on the basis of awareness.
Expect there to be fairly widespread coverage in the Bitcoin press, and as
the fork draws near, maybe coverage in business and tech publications.
Further, the alert keys will certainly be used, so node operators will get
the message directly.
3: There still needs to be a targeted attack by a fraudster on an unaware
node operator.
To fall victim, one needs to give up something of value to an attacker in
exchange for Bitcoins (on the old chain).  The typical uninitiated
full-node user (probably a small subset anyway) is typically going to be
buying bitcoin from a trusted source, and then saving or spending them, or
perhaps gambling.  They are not, typically, going to be providing a service
or selling goods in exchange for Bitcoin unless they are at least somewhat
aware of what is going on in the Bitcoin space.  It's possible, of course,
but we are talking about small numbers here of people who fit the above.
All three parts of the above would have to go perfectly wrong for someone
to loose out.  Someone somewhere will probably get scammed as a result of a
hardfork.  That stinks, and we should make reasonable efforts to help them
avoid that fate.  But at this point in Bitcoin's development, it is still
in beta, it's still an economic experiment, and we can't allow the software
to become hamstrung out of fear that some inattentive user might bungle
their security.  If they merely waited for 6 confirmations, as is the
standard advice, they would be waiting for days.  If that along doesn't
give them a hint that something is wrong, it might still be too early days
for them to be playing with Bitcoin for anything important.
I support a hardfork deployment that takes 80% of hashpower activate + a
4-month delay.

If it turns out that the blocksize divide is hinging on differing developer
views on the nature of the threat posed by governments, perhaps it would be
better to defer to people who specialize in that area.  There are plenty of
them operating in the Bitcoin space.  I am familiar with some of the United
States based policy people, such as Jerry Brito, Alex Fowler, Constance
Choi, Jim Harper, Patrick Murck, etc..  If they are not sure how to frame
their ideas as they relate to this debate, maybe the devs could pose some
questions for them to answer.  If the bitcoin policy people are not of
help, maybe we should turn to some political philosophers or something.
The main idea here is that if this is a politics question, please consider
you may be outside your area of expertise.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Hardware Wallet Standard 
*One of my biggest fears about using any wallet is the "whoops, cosmic ray
flipped a bit while producing receiving address; SFYL!" possibility. For
high value cold storage, I always generate my addresses on two independent
machines using two different pieces of software. Am I nuts for doing that?*
A randomly flipped bit would be extremely unlikely to yield a valid
address, however, I still think it you are wise to use independent routes
to confirm that your addresses match the keys.  I do the same when I
generating my cold storage key pairs.  I think malicious address
substitution is an under appreciated attack vector.
Regarding this thread in general, would it make sense for this proposal to
include standards for multi-sig wallet interoperability?  A whole spectrum
of attacks would be made less likely - and easy for typical users to guard
against - by using wallets on separate devices AND where the wallet
software was written and provided by different parties.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP proposal: Increase block size limit to 2 
We don't have any evidence of how fast nodes will upgrade when faced with
an impending hard fork, but it seems like a very safe assumption that the
upgrade pace will be significantly faster.  The hard fork case it is:
"upgrade or be kicked off the network".  In the previous cases it has been,
"here's the latest and greatest, give it a go!".  Also, there will be
alerts sent out warning people of the situation, prompting them to take
It is unclear if this will translate into more or less than 6x the adoption
speed of previous instances, but the idea that it would be faster is
solid.  28 days is aggressive, but again, it is only 28 days from when the
fork triggers.  Compatible software is already available for anyone who
wants to prepare.
It is also of significance that this proposed fork, and this debate, has
been going on for many, many months.  If someone proposed a forking concept
today, wrote the BIP tomorrow, deployed it next week, miners adopted it
instantly, and 28 days later it was the flag day, those 28 days would be in
a different context.  There is no surprise here.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Hardfork to fix difficulty drop algorithm 
Since the root cause of what you are trying to address is the reward
having, I'd suggest considering an adjustment to the having schedule.
Instead of their being a large supply shock every four years, perhaps the
reward could drop every 52,500 blocks (yearly), or even at each difficulty
adjustment, in such a way that the inflation curve is smoothed out.  The
exponential decay rate would be preserved, so overall economic philosophy
would be preserved.
I'm guessing hesitance to this approach would lie in a reluctance to tinker
with Bitcoin's 'economic contract', and slippery slope concerns about might
be the next change (21M?).  However, I think it could actually increase
confidence in the system if the community is able to demonstrate a good
process for making such decisions, and show that we can separate the
meaningful underlying principles, such as the coin limit and overall
inflation rate, from what is more akin to an implementation detail, as I
consider the large-step reward reduction to be.
I'm not too worried about the impact of the having as is, but adjusting the
economic parameter would be a safer and simpler way to address the concerns
than to tinker with the difficulty targeting mechanism, which is at the
heart of Bitcoin's security
