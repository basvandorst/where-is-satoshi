Part of the aversion to using bech32 may be that the BCH code used in
bech32 for error detection doesn't hold up for messages longer than some
length (that I can't remember off the top of my head).  It still encodes
and decodes perfectly well but a decoder won't be guaranteed to detect
potential errors, so that's somewhat wasted there.  Maybe someone should
define a derivatives of bech32 that retains error detection properties for
longer message lengths, such as those used in lightning invoices.
QR codes (as Pavol mentioned) have built-in error detection (using its own
BCH code scheme), somewhat mitigate this when used there.  Although
personally I'm skeptical of how useful payment descriptors are for the
kinds of quick transactions that QR codes work well for.

Offtopic: I believe that this kind of "evil soft fork" where nodes who
don't upgrade can continue to read the blockchain, update their
utxoset, etc. but can't actually spend some or all of the coins they
have has been referred to as a "firm fork".  I think this is a pretty
useful term to pass around when talking about potential future forks.
The earliest reference I can find to that term from a quick search is
this talk from 2016 by Adam Back:

============================== START ==============================
Hello all,
This might be another proto-BIP similar to the post about using a card
shuffle as a wallet seed that was posted here a few weeks back:
This is an idea I had to deriving a wallet seed from the lucky numbers
on a fortunes from fortune cookies [1].
On one side is some silly fortune, which we don't really care about
here.  But depending on the brand, on the other side there's 2 parts:
* "Learn Chinese", with a word in English and its translation into
Chinese characters and the (probably) pinyin.
* "Lucky Numbers", followed by usually 6 or 7 numbers, presumably in
the range of 1 to 99.  Someone can correct me on this if I'm wrong.
So each number should have around ~6.6 bits of entropy, which means
you could generate a "very secure" wallet seed with about 7 fortunes.
We can remember the order of the numbers on these fortunes based on
the English words, which we can commit to memory.
It's considered a rule of thumb that you can remember "7 things" at
once, which is pretty convenient for this.  Sometimes the numbers are
sorted, which decreases the entropy a bit, but that can be remedied
with just more fortunes.  This also splits up the information required
to reconstruct the seed into both something physical and something
remembered, and there isn't any particular ordering that someone can
mess up by, say, shuffling the card deck.  Although someone is
arguably more likely to throw away random fortunes than they are to
throw away a deck of cards which is a weakness of this scheme.
It also arguably has better deniability.  If you keep a pile of 20
fortunes (with different "Learn Chinese" words) and remember which 7
of them are for your key, but pick another 7 you can use to make a
decoy wallet to use if being forced to reveal a wallet.  Keeping 20
around is a little excessive but it gives 390700800 possible wallets.
So security can be trivially parameterized based on how secure you
want your wallet to be if someone finds your stash.
I wrote a little Python script to generate a key with this, it's not
very clean and could be much improved but it works pretty well as a
proof of concept: -Trey Del Bonis

Yes that's a problem that I'm now realizing exists.  Whoops!  Changing
the parameters to a 25-of-50 setup gets us ~129 bits in that case,
which is better but still somewhat crappy as 25 is a lot of words to
remember.  You'd be *far* better off just memorizing a BIP-39
seedphrase.  Maybe it would make sense to include in the hash some
extra secret phrase as extra entropy?  Probably not worth it.
Upon some later research I found that this is actually the case from
certain vendors, which is unfortunate.
Because it was a fun idea I had while eating Chinese take-out the other day. :)
