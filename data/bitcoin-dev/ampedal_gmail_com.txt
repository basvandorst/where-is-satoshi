? If he's willing, I propose that Amir take the role of BIP editor.
As for what Nils mentioned on using GitHub's Wiki feature, Gavin seems to
have started a few proposals at
 I think this is the right
direction to head in, and a composite list of similar proposals could be
maintained on their own repository (to maintain separation from the core
Bitcoin repo.)

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Testing commits 
I am working on the following to create a stable build environment for
- Build bitcoin 4.0 source in Windows 7
- Create a package of the build dependencies, and upload to SF
- Write up instructions for the build process
x Build bitcoin 4.0 source in Ubuntu 11
- Create a package of the build dependencies, and upload to SF
- Write up instructions for the build process
I am also compiling a list of commits that need to be tested in both
environments. If you can think of any priority commits that need testing,
and/or have a test case for them - please link the pull request in a
response to This is not a requirement for pull requests, but will help process the
important/easy ones a lot faster. I would love to discuss other ways of
prioritizing pull requests, but this seems like it can get the job done for
the time-being.

I expect that I will make a lot of mistakes, and probably ask too many
questions - but I hope you can bear with me.
I've been trying to keep a low profile as I get better acquainted with the
project. I'm clearly in the company of some very smart people - and would
like to keep it that way.
I've tried to do my research on the main contributors, and it seems that
Matt is the only one to escape my Google stalking. If you have any questions
about my background - feel free to inquire.
It's difficult to ascertain what needs QA work first, so any guidance or
suggestion is appreciated. I'm available via social networks, email, phone,
fax?, IM, IRC, etc. Let me know your preference, or don't and I'll bugger
I'll try to stay out of the way, and do my best to make the development
cycle easier. Let me know if I'm stepping on toes, or being annoying. I
won't be offended.
As for the commit testing, I want to have an idiot proof solution to get as
many people testing as possible (eventually). With code like this, I think
it's better to go full-auto with the ACKs.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Bitcoin-qt ready for merging 
Can you please submit a pull request and testing plan? If these already
exist, can you please link them here?
I'm exciting to get this in, as it will close the wx issues. (and hopefully
not bring on too many qt issues)

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Difficulty adjustment / time issues 
Could we bundle this and potential future blockchain-splitting changes
- to implement them in a major release (down the road)? Or save them
for when they are very necessary?
TL;DR shelf it until needed, have it written just in case.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Bitcoin Enhancement Proposals (BEPS) 
is a good reference if you're
interested in seeing how PEPs work in action. I would be more than
willing to maintain a similar index if that's what people want.
Something to note is that Python does not use Git or GitHub (AFAIK).
So we would need to update 001 to reflect the BEP involvement with
Git, or transition away from it completely (which I discourage).
My full-time experience as a project manager with Basecamp, Redmine,
Teamlab, Pivotal Tracker, SVN, and custom VC has taught me that it is
hard to find a good solution for the organization of the development
life cycle. Having examined Bitcoin for the past three weeks, it is
hard to discern the willingness to implement meta changes.
It looks like Git/GitHub is working, but not ideal for everyone. My
opinion is that there will always be a missing feature in VC systems.
My major gripes with GitHub are the lack of prioritization options,
voting system, and reporting/metrics.
Gavin has asked me to research various O/S projects, to see how they
are doing things. I have been focused mostly on organizing a pull
testing system, and learning the testing process - but I can spend
more time on meta organization if that is in demand. It would be
helpful to me if I could hear some feedback on what needs changing,
and how important it is.
My recommendation is that we continue with the current system, but
plan alternative organization voting around the time of 0.5 release.
This could be an alternative to GitHub, or a supplement, or neither.
Seeing as we are still in Beta, I don't believe there needs immense
structure until we approach 1.0. The PEP system is outstanding, and is
clearly a solid alternative/supplement to consider.

I'm sorry that I misunderstood the protocol being separate from the
client in regard to 'BEPS'. It definitely makes more sense that way.
As far as naming; I vote BER pronounced Beer.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Issue / Pulls timers 
I would like to propose adding timers to the pulls / issues:
"From time to time a pull request will become outdated. If this occurs, and
the pull is no longer automatically mergeable; it will be closed after 15
days. This can be avoided by rebasing the commit. Pull requests closed in this
manner will have their corresponding issue labeled stagnant.
Non-bug issues with no commits will be closed after 15 days from their
last activity.
Issues closed in this manner will be labeled stale.
Requests to reopen closed pull requests and/or issues can be submitted to
QA at BitcoinTesting.org. "
This will help cut down on the abandoned / stagnant pulls and issues.
It will also focus attention on priority items, and phase out unwanted changes.
Sidenote: QA at BitcoinTesting.org is working, unlike QA at Bitcoin.org

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Issue / Pulls timers 
I agree, I definitely want to go about this in a non-jerk way. I would
be pissed if I spent hours coding something, and it was put on the
back burner and eventually closed (especially without notice). The
wording and process could use refinement.
I can definitely do this, and give a wordy notice before I start the
timer. I will write up a message that links to a rebase walkthrough
(any suggestions? I think Gavin has one somewhere...), I would like it
to be more detailed than GitHub's walk-through.
My main reason for pushing this is that it will help clear out some of
the older pulls/issues that exist right now. I'm hoping that in the
future, the QA process will be good enough that pulls/issues won't
fall behind from lack of testing - and the timers will be used very
sparingly. It should only be in place to sort out the pulls/issues
that the majority doesn't want included in the client.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] 0.4.x stable branch 
I think what Jeff has said is ideal for a stable 1.0 or 1.1 release of
a kernal. I also think it's absolutely the direction we should be
heading in, but not this afternoon. The desire to keep a 0.4.x stable
branch is a symptom of a bigger QA problem, one that I am attempting
to address in general.
Gavin has reminded me to test, test, test. I implore anyone who clicks
the pull button to not only test their code, but write down how they
tested it. The issue tracker is somewhat out of control, and my
opinion is that a stable branch is not going to fix it.
This stage of development can be agitating, as you implement code in
the wild - it is outpaced or broken easily. The sooner we can get a
robust QA process to hammer out bugs, and process pulls - the closer
we are to a stable 1.0 release.
Please contact me if you would like to help contribute to the bug
hammering - I promise that we can find ways to make it
interesting/challenging. (working on a zapper too!)
