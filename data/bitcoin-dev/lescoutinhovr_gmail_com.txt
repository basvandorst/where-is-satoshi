One interesting thing to do is to compare how much does it cost to maintain
a bank check account and how much does it cost to run a full node.
It seems that it is about 120USD/year in USA:
A 4TB hard drive ~=115USD
And it has a warranty of 3 years.
As your calculation shows, it will take more than 19 years to reach 4TB
with a 4MB blocksize.

respect and admiration, I do not agree with some of their conclusions
I'm one of the co-authors of that study. I'd be the first to agree with
your conclusion
and argue that the 4MB size suggested in that paper should not be used
compensation for two important changes to the network.
Our recent measurements of the Bitcoin P2P network show that network speeds
have improved tremendously. From February 2016 to February 2017, the average
provisioned bandwidth of a reachable Bitcoin node went up by approximately
And that's just in the last year.
4 * 144 * 30 = 17.3GB per month, or 207GB per year. Full node
initialisation will become prohibitive for most users until a shortcut is
made (e.g. witness pruning and UTXO commitment but these are not trust-free)
Further, the emergence of high-speed block relay networks, like Falcon (
and FIBRE, as well as block compression, e.g. BIP152 and xthin, change the
picture dramatically.
Also as the co-author of the selfish mining paper, you should know all
these technology assume big miners being benevolent.
So, the 4MB limit mentioned in our paper should not be used as a protocol
limit today.

It would be very interesting if a new node could decide to be a pruned node:
  - it would need to trust one or more peers for the initial blockchain
download, because the blocks downloaded would not be validated
  - it would decide a time from when to get the blocks, like a week before
  - once a day a routine would run that would prune blocks older than the
chosen time
*The unspent transaction outputs (which is the only essential piece ofdata
necessary for validation) are already kept in a separate database,so
technically removing old blocks is perfectly possible.*" Pieter Wuille

for a new node to enter the network and to verify the data, it needs to
download all data and prune it by itself. This will drastically lower the
information needed by the full nodes by getting rid of the junk.  Currently
we are around 140GB, that number is getting bigger exponentially, by the
number of users and transactions created. It could reach a Terrabyte sooner
than expected, we need to act now.
To have to download all blockchain for then prune is a big drawback.
So I thought about the concept of "trusted" nodes, where you could choose
some nodes to connect and from which block you want to download. Of course
they would do this by their own risk, but there are ways to minimize the
risk, like:
  - check the latest blocks (hashes) if they match what you find in some
sites, like blockchain.info
  - download and compare the utxo from all (some) the nodes you are
Currently utxo size is around 2GB and we cant know how fast it will grow (?)

Thank you Thomas for your response.
1) Implement solution is impossible... I have given a solution in part II.
By adding a Genesis Account which will be the new sender.
2)Keeping older blocks: Yes as I said 10 older blocks should be kept, that
should suffice. I am not locked on that number, if you think there is a
reason to keep more than that, it is open to debate.
3) Why 1000? To be honest, that number came off the top of my head. These
are minor details, the concept must first be accepted, then we can work on
the minor details.
4)Finally it's not just the addresses and balance you need to save...  I
think the Idea of the Genesis Account, solves this issue.
5) The problem with node pruning is that it is not standardized, and for a
new node to enter the network and to verify the data, it needs to download
all data and prune it by itself. This will drastically lower the
information needed by the full nodes by getting rid of the junk.  Currently
we are around 140GB, that number is getting bigger exponentially, by the

On your second email:
When I say account: I mean private-public key.
The way bitcoin works, as I understand it, is that the funds are verified
by showing that they have an origin, this "origin" needs to provide a
signature, otherwise the transaction won't be accepted.
If I am proposing to remove all intermediate origins, then the funds become
untraceable and hence unverifiable. To fix that, a new transaction needs to
replace old ones. A simplified version: If there was a transaction chain
A->B->C->D, and I wish to show only A->D, only a transaction like that
never actually occurred, it would be impossible to say that it did without
having A's private key, in order to sign this transaction. In order to
create this transaction, I need A's private key. And if I wish this to be
publicly implemented I need this key to be public, so that any node
creating this Exodus Block can sign with it. Hence the Genesis Account. And
yes, it is not really an account.

?so far. I wonder how long that vacation will last?
...but we can be sure that it will be, since the dollar value held in
existing utxos continues to increase...
Does that offer any greater protection? That?s not so clear to me as the
outputs (at least for p2pkh) only verify the public key against the final
20 byte hash. Specifically, in the first (notional) case the challenge
would be to find a private key that has a public key that hashes to the
final hash. In the second (realistic) case, you merely need to add the
sha256 hash into the problem, which doesn?t seem to me to increase the
difficulty by any significant amount?

If people split their bitcoins in multiple addresses, then maybe there
would be no need to worry(?), because the computational cost would be
higher than what the attacker would get.
