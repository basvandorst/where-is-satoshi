For the purposes of finding the median, halve < same < double. It will only
change if a majority of non-apathetic votes are for halve or a majority of

Then they shouldn't care about the block size limit, since an increase in
block size (and thus in the number of txs they get fees from) will only
increase their revenue "negligibly".
