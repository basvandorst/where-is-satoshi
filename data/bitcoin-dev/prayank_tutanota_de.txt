@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP - Automated and Secure Communication 
Hello Everyone,
I know there have been lot of controversial and heated discussions involving Samourai in past. Ignoring everything including the tweets in which Samourai team mentioned no interest in proposing a BIP related to automated and secure communication used in Soroban, I wanted to know if enough people would be interested in a BIP because it may help other bitcoin projects in future.
Tweets:?  Ben also tweeted that a BIP would make sense:? I think we should keep all the controversial things aside and do everything that helps Bitcoin. It's mentioned in the medium article that it can help other projects like joinmarket, coinswap, snickr etc.
The source code for a client library in Java is available here  and the source code for the Go based server component is available here Let me know if a BIP for such implementation to be used by other bitcoin projects makes sense and if anyone willing to help me in creating a BIP.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Post-mix(coinjoin) usage with multisig and cpfp in 
I have explained the whole idea with a proof of concept in this link:?
Does it make sense to add such options in bitcoin core wallet and how is the overall idea once we have taproot because for now people can check if the tx involves a multisig address?
Reading Peter Wuille's reply here it seems taproot will improve privacy for multisig:?
Looking for some feedback to work on this idea and don't want it to just remain an article on medium.?

Hello?ZmnSCPxj, Thanks for the feedback.
1. Peer 1 doesn't need to be a trusted third party, it can be implemented in a way that some peers involved in this system can provide liquidity for others and incentives can be a small fee.
2. Yes joinmarket is awesome and its payjoin will be better to achieve the same but I was trying to contribute and add more options for people to improve privacy on Bitcoin. If we have different ways to mix it will be harder for spy companies to analyze of some of the transactions.
3. Also one such setup might not make a huge difference but a chain of such mixers will surely work better if everything done correctly.?
4. Maybe multisig usage is not ideal for such things right now and I am not the best person when it comes to coding but think that better privacy for multisig will make it possible for lot of ideas to be implemented on Bitcoin using different multisig setups and combination of other things that we already have.?

Thanks for your response.
The spending tx of multisig can be decided earlier and all three can review the outputs involved in it. All 3 txs involved in the system if we consider only one mixer and not a chain will get confirmed in the same block as we are using CPFP so child pays for 2 parent txs. However, disputes are possible and to manage it we will have to make the system complex with things like Peer 1 locking some amount in a 2 of 2 multisig with Peer 2 or some other incentives structure. Initially we can try to keep it simple and a way to spend coins after coinjoin with the help of another person you trust.
Yes, you described coinjoin in joinmarket but the problem I am trying to solve is: spend coins after coinjoin because post-mix usage is as important as coinjoin. Some users dont follow the best practices after coinjoin and it makes coinjoin useless or less effective in that case and sometimes for others involved in the process as well.
Samourai has few options for users to do this and one of them is: Stonewallx2 which is a mini coinjoin and similar to what I was trying with this idea.
End goal is to create more options for users to spend UTXOs easily in different ways after coinjoin which makes it difficult for people trying to analyze transactions or algorithms monitoring, flagging, reporting txs 24/7
Its just an idea for now and maybe I might find better ways to solve this problem once I start working on it. For me it makes sense to experiment with things and provide more options for users but I wanted to see what others think about it who are more experienced and skilled to develop bitcoin related projects.
Thanks for this link:?
Looks interesting.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] bips.txt format for all Bitcoin projects 
Hello Everyone,
Can we request all Bitcoin projects to create a file 'bips.txt' with a format that describes all the BIPs used in the project?
The file can be uploaded to the root of website used for the project. For example: BTCPay can have this file at:?? in below format:
BIP Number:
BIP Number
Bitcoin Improvement Proposals play an important role in Bitcoin and this will make it easier for users, other devs, journalists, researchers, crawlers etc. to understand all BIPs used in different Bitcoin Projects, their implementation and importance.?
Every BIP with details is mentioned here already:? I don't think all the devs who initially start researching about Bitcoin or the users really understand their importance, usage etc. So I am also trying to create BIPs gallery which has basic images for each BIP right now and later will include a page to have?video links, usage, issues, history, other helpful links etc. later for each.
The discussion started with this question on stackexchange:? Website that I am working on:?
Github repository for it:?
