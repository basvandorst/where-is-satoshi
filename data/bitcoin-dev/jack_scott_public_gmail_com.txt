Title: Physical key / edge detection software and PIN to generate a Bitcoin
private key
Author: Jack Scott

A method is proposed to generate a Bitcoin private key by using a physical
key in conjunction with image recognition software and a PIN.  Use edge
detection software applied to incoming video feed to convert the shape of a
physical key into an equation that describes the key.  The hash of the
key's equation plus a user generated five digit pin can then be used to
create a Bitcoin private key.
