That's a good question.
An argument has been put forward that a larger block size would reduce
the security of the network, so does the converse hold?

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] What Lightning Is 
There's also an interesting question posted over at Reddit - will
Lightning payment hubs be treated as money transmitters in the US?
A payment hub operator working with brand name merchants like Disney and
Gap would most likely adopt any licensing and AML/KYC regulations.
Some folk might thus find themselves forced to use anonymous hubs with
strict routing requirements to avoid commercial hubs.  Given the reduced
number of available channels, this could drive up lightning network fees
for those folk.
Of course, two parties can avoid any intermediary by using a regular
on-chain transaction, but it might not be feasible if Bitcoin is
operating as a settlement network with high transaction fees.

Yes, you're right, the Bitcoin Foundation is facing many challenges, but
that's an entirely different discussion.
The question in hand is this: was the request to remove Gavin made by an
individual of their own volition, reflecting their own personal opinion,
or was it made on behalf of the company?
If the latter, it would imply that compromise is unlikely to be reached
and thus the ecosystem should start planning immediately for the
potential hard fork, rather than waiting and hoping for things to be

I don't think this would work.
If the rule is that one user can only have one vote, how do you prevent
a user running multiple nodes?
Also, how do you verify that a node is indeed a fully validating node
with its own copy of the blockchain?

Peter, perhaps your BIP can look at possible ways to isolate the

If Bitcoin is a $3bn project where stakeholder interests are to be
safeguarded, or if Bitcoin is to be compared to a civil engineering
project where life and death is at stake, it seems only logical that a
well-defined and well-documented process be introduced to properly
evaluate proposed changes.  Although too late for the block size debate,
it seems odd that discussion of such a process is often dismissed out of

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] [patch] Switching Bitcoin Core to sqlite db 
Storage of UTXO data looks like an implementation detail and thus one
would have thought that the choice of database would not increase the
odds of consensus protocol failure.
Btcd, a full node implementation written in Go, already provides a
database interface which supports different backends:
Given that UTXO storage is considered critical, it seems reasonable to
let a node operator decide for themselves if they want data stored in
LevelDB (which is not fully ACID compliant) or a database like Sqlite,
Oracle, DB2 etc.
If the storage requirements for UTXO data are fairly simple, consisting
mainly of puts and gets, there is a decent argument that using a
dedicated key-value store provides superior performance over a
traditional SQL database.
However, from a practical perspective, given that nodes operate on a
range of different hardware and even a little Raspberry Pi can run a
full node and keep up with the network, why not let those users with the
resources to operate big iron databases do so?  It would be a good
feature to have.

Hi Jeff,
Thoughts on this part of the proposal:
"Absent/invalid votes are counted as votes for the current hardLimit.
Out of range votes are counted as the nearest in-range value."
1. Why should an absent vote be considered a vote for the status quo?  A
non-voter should have zero impact on the result.
2. Why should out of range votes be counted?  They're an invalid vote, a
spoiled ballot as such, and thus it would be better if they were discarded.

Maybe grab some code from BIP101 ?  It permits block messages > 2MB,
while retaining the current limit of 2 MB imposed on other network
messages.  The 32 MB limit was patched a few months ago.

Discussion quietened down but never went away.  With centralization of
mining in China, the topic is up for discussion again.  For example,
Z.Cash will now use Equihash as their proof-of-work scheme.
Central planning is a slippery slope.  Let the market decide the winners
and losers.  It's not feasible to hard fork every time an innovation or
perceived unfair advantage appears in the space.

If some fixes have been committed with discreet log messages, it will be
difficult for third parties to identify and assess the importance of any
critical patches.  Do any important ones come to mind?

in the defect rate, at least based on the list of publicly reported
CVEs, to fall to zero?  A change to the development process?
