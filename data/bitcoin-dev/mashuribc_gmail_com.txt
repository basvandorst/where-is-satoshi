Why not speculate on a real market? ?Peter Sztorc proposed a sidechain that could be implemented now using Blockstream's method:
Rather than speculating on fake markets, why don?t we use theory, empirical data, and engineering to fix the damn problems?
Given there is no money at stake in these prediction games, it is no surprise that the results are implausible.
And the preliminary results of using a prediction market to try to wrestle with the tough tradeoffs looks roughly correct to me, too:? ?
?The scicast prediction market is shutdown atm (since early July?) so those numbers aren't live. But...
Network hash rate
 3,255.17 PH/s ?(same block size) 5,032.64 PH/s ?(block size increase)
 4,969.68 PH/s ?(no replace-by-fee)
 3,132.09 PH/s ?(replace-by-fee)
Those numbers seem completely implausible: that's ~2.9-3.6 doublings of the current hashrate (< 400PH/s) in 17 months, when it's taken 12 months for the last doubling, and there's a block reward reduction due in that period too. (That might've been a reasonable prediction sometime in the past year, when doublings were slowing from once every ~45 days to once a year; it just doesn't seem a supportable prediction now)
That the PH/s rate is higher with bigger blocks is surprising, but given that site also predicts USD/BTC will be $280 with no change but $555 with bigger blocks, so I assume that difference is mostly due to price. Also, 12.5btc at $555 each is about 23 btc at $300 each, so if that price increase is realistic, it would compensate for almost all of the block reward reduction.
Daily transaction volume 168,438.22 tx/day ?(same block size) 193,773.08 tx/day ?(block size increase)
 192,603.80 tx/day ?(no replace-by-fee) 168,406.73 tx/day ?(replace-by-fee)
That's only a 15% increase in transaction volume due to the block size increase; I would have expected more? 168k-194k tx/day is also only a 30%-50% increase in transaction volume from 130k tx/day currently. If that's really the case, then a 1.5MB-2MB max block size would probably be enough for the next two years...
(Predicting that the node count will drop from ~5000 to ~1200 due to increasing block sizes seems quite an indictment as far as centralisation risks go; but given I'm not that convinced by the other predictions, I'm not sure I want to give that much weight to that one either)

CORRECTION: That's Paul Sztorc. Not Peter. ?Apologies for my abysmal proofreading.

Would it be easy to code in another variable?  I think it would be useful to
know how a per-node imposed max block size limit (with this limit, a node
would still accept all incoming blocks, but refuse to relay any above a
specified size) would affect orphan rates and reorgs.  Example: What would
the orphan rate be of an 8MB block if 80% of all nodes refuse to relay it?
The resulting data would provide insight into how nodes can enforce a
dynamic maximum block size in absence of a hard limit.
I would do this myself but I am not a coder.  I'm hoping someone here who is
capable finds this data worth pursuing.
