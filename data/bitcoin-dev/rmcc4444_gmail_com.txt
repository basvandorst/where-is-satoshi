@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] 2 step confirmation system 
I know from speaking to my friends not involved with Bitcoin that two of
their major concerns are as follows:
1. They are afraid if they fat finger the address there is nothing they can
do about it and not get their Bitcoin back.
2. They would like to at least have the option to use some sort of 2 step
confirmation system when dealing ith people they do not know. For example,
after sending the Bitcoin to a seller they would like to be able to do a
final approval of the tm transaction. If the 2 people involved in the
transaction approve of it within X hours, the coin returns to the original
person. This system would basically act as an escrow.
This 2 step system could work with both of these.
I apologize if this is the incorrect place to post this. I did not know
where else to share these thoughts.
Thanks for your time.
