What do you know, it worked. Finished.
Once again Norway finishes ahead of Sweden. :P
By the way, I had to translate some of the exact same strings 2-3 times.
That's something you may want to improve on.

Three quick examples of duplicated strings. There are many more. Some of
the smaller ones may make sense to have duplicated several times in
english as their translated versions may differ in other languages. But
with these below I don't see the point.
Twice, with a small difference ( vs. none):
WARNING: If you encrypt your wallet and lose your passphrase, you will
LOSE ALL OF YOUR BITCOINS! Are you sure you wish to encrypt your
WARNING: If you encrypt your wallet and lose your passphrase, you will
LOSE ALL OF YOUR BITCOINS! Are you sure you wish to encrypt your wallet?
Again twice, with a small difference (%s vs %1):
This transaction is over the size limit. You can still send it for a fee
of %1, which goes to the nodes that process your transaction and helps
to support the network. Do you want to pay the fee?

Twice, looks exactly the same:
Generated coins must wait 120 blocks before they can be spent. When you
generated this block, it was broadcast to the network to be added to the
block chain. If it fails to get into the chain, it will change to "not
accepted" and not be spendable. This may occasionally happen if another
node generates a block within a few seconds of yours.

Looks like much goodness in this version. Thanks for all this work.
Any chance that options to limit the size of blocks and prioritize paid
vs free txes could make it in?
By the way, by far the most common support request I have at my pool is
users withdrawing coins and not seeing it in their wallet because it's
not up-to-date with the block chain. Might be worth adding something in
the bitcoin-qt GUI to make it more obvious that users can't see new
transactions and why.
I just now updated the Norwegian translation on Transifex, if you'd like
to do another pull before the release. For some reason there were many
strings I had already translated that now had no translation and had to
be done again (even ones that had the same English text). Many languages
are now only about 50% translated.
Also there were new duplicated strings:
"Verify a message to ensure it was signed with a specified Bitcoin address"
"Sign a message to prove you own a Bitcoin address"
"Clear &All"
These two seem odd:
Use UPnP to map the listening port (default: 0)
Use UPnP to map the listening port (default: 1 when listening)

That makes sense. But it's hard to translate when you just see the same
string twice and don't know the context where it will be used.
No, I just use copy and paste.
Sorry, forgot there was a compiler flag for this. No need to split this
up. As long as there is no explanation or description for each string I
think it's easier to translate whole sentences.
something in
Perfect. This will prevent a lot of confusion. Thanks!

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] getmemorypool BIP process 
Looking forward to implementing this in my pool backend and miner.
A few comments:
"transactions 	add or remove transactions (both of the above; default if
"transactions" omitted) "
In the above, you may want to specify that the "transactions" referred
to here is the one in the first table (JSON-RPC response object) and not
the mutations. For a moment I thought free tx editing was the default.
Long polling as currently implemented in pools has a race condition.
Does the miner reconnect first or does another block change happen
first? "Double" block changes are common with merged mining and I'm
doing all sorts of tricks in my pool backend to reduce this problem.
How about another entry "longpollid" in long poll responses. The last
seen longpollid should be included by the client in future long poll
requests. This enables the server to see if the client has missed any
block changes. The ID could perhaps be submitted in an HTTP header
(X-LongPollID?) if we wish to keep the JSON-RPC params empty, or params
could hold an object with a key "longpollid". Could be a string or
number, like "workid".
Another useful value in the getmemorypool response would be "height", so
the miner can include the correct height in the coinbase. I would like
that in bitcoind as well. One JSON-RPC call instead of two, and no race
condition between getmemorypool and getblocknumber.
It should be explained how target vs. fulltarget works.
Perhaps some things should be optional for a client to implement? I
think "noncerange" is of limited use and there's a good chance of
getting the endianness wrong.

If the client doesn't tell you which block change it saw last, you can't
avoid this problem completely.
I think long polling and reconnecting to LP is an HTTP-specific problem
anyway? So it may be best to go with an HTTP header. See below for an
idea for a capabilities reporting system, though, which would allow
putting this data into JSON.
I think "should" makes sense.
Reading through it again it is mostly clear except for one thing, how to
submit "share/merkle" style. It doesn't say exactly how to submit this data.
It says merkle tree, but a merkle branch should suffice. Also, I believe
the coinbase must always be the first transaction of a block? So we
won't need the transaction's index in the merkle tree (it's always index
zero). This would then be just an array of sha256 hashes making up the
merkle branch for the coinbase.
I'd prefer if block header, coinbase tx and merkle branch were submitted
in 3 pieces. When merged mining and submitting a block generating proof
to the aux backend you put an auxiliary proof of work between the block
header and transactions. So the header and transactions are not
necessarily adjacent. Also, there's no merkle branch in a regular
bitcoin block.
Let's add an optional "servercapabilities" key on the server side, the
value being a space-delimited list of what's supported by the server. If
that list contains "clientcapabilities" then the client may, instead of
sending an empty request, send an object where one of the keys is
"clientcapabilities", and the value is a space-delimited list of extensions.
Those names are a bit long, maybe "caps" is better.
Ok, this is not entirely clean. For the first request the client won't
know what the server supports. For subsequent requests I guess always
assume the last caps the server reported.
Yes, you can end up getting half a nonce range from an upstream server,
and not being able to make use of it because your downstream clients
don't support it.
A single GPU can make full use of the noncerange if you allow the
timestamp to slip a few seconds into the past. I believe most miners do
that today.
Also worth including are the "hostlist" and "switchto" getwork
extensions. I think those can fit right into the JSON response, to keep
with being transport-agnostic, but otherwise look like they do for getwork.

3) A few more people begin using bitcoin. Bitcoin buckles and dies.
- Something happens a few months from now causing an influx of new users
and more transactions.
- Blocks are constantly full.
- A backlog of transactions keeps growing indefinitely.
- At first people say "bitcoin is slow". After a while they say "bitcoin
doesn't work".
- Changing the hard limit on block size requires a fork and takes too long.
- As bitcoin no longer works people stop using it.
- Bitcoin lives out the last of its days in the backwaters of the
internet with only 5 users. They keep telling people "we increased the
block size now". Unfortunately noone is listening anymore.
- People laugh at you and say "I told you that buttcoin thing was doomed
to fail. After all it wasn't real money."
If the hard limit had been increased earlier then mining pools would
have been able to react quickly by upping their own soft limit. But this
was not the case and so ended Bitcoin.
So in summary:
By increasing the block size limit you run the risk of:
- The transaction fee market takes a little longer to develop.
By not increasing the limit you run the risk of:
- Bitcoin dies. The end.
Transaction fees should not be the main topic of this discussion, and
probably not even a part of it at all. That seems outright irresponsible
to me.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Fees and the block-finding process 
I don't think rising fees is the issue.
Imagine that the government is worried because air lines are selling
tickets cheaply and may run themselves out of business. So their
solution is passing a new law that says only one commercial air plane is
allowed to be in the air at any given time.
This should help a ticket market to develop and prevent air lines from
giving away almost free tickets. In this way the government can protect
the air lines from themselves.
I would not classify all issues that would come out of this as
"potential indirect consequences of rising ticket prices."
It would just make air travel unusable.
That's the problem we may face in the short term.
It would be unwise to go all-in on a solution that doesn't exist yet,
which may or may not arrive in time, and may or may not do the job that
is needed. We need to use the solution we already have so that we can
get by in the short term.
I don't think mining pools will immediately make blocks as big as
possible if the hard limit is raised. Remember that mining pools had to
be coaxed into increasing their block size. Mining pools were making
small blocks to reduce the rate of orphaned blocks. Block propagation is
faster today, but this issue still exists. You need a lot of transaction
fees to make up for the danger of losing 25 BTC. Many pools don't even
pay out transaction fee income to their miners.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] We need to fix the block withholding attack 
Block withholding attacks do not differentiate between small and large
pools. When Eligius and BTCGuild got hit with this, they were far from
the biggest pools at the time.
When my pool, Bitminter, got a new large miner who found 1 block where
average luck would have had them find 3, one of the other miners claimed
they must be withholding blocks. Even if there is no logic or evidence
behind it, after one person cries wolf the others get nervous. This way
even the possibility of block withholding can keep smaller pools from
growing. It takes more hashpower to put a dent in a bigger pool, so you
will see less such panic.
Three guys with 1 TH/s, 2 TH/s and 100 GH/s meet at a conference and
decide to start a private pool? Obviously that doesn't work. Maybe three
people with huge warehouses of miners would work together if they knew
and trusted each other.
Those small miners need to mine with people they don't know to get an
acceptable variance.
If you kill off mining pools then small miners have no way to achieve
acceptable variance and they will disappear. There will only be big
warehouse miners left, the ones who are big enough to solo mine.
That's not helping decentralization.
I agree. It's very disappointing how most miners and pools handle this
(BTCGuild being the exception). But I do not think block withholding is
a good tool. It can easily destroy small pools, but it won't put a dent
in a pool that goes over 50%.
Block withholding is a tool big pools can use to put smaller competitors
out of business.
And even if it was effective I would not use block withholding to attack
other pools.
Is it? Is there any example of block withholding leading to more
decentralized mining?
If I remember right, GHash being too big ended with BitFury moving some
of their hashpower out of the pool. I don't know where that hashpower
went and whether the problem was solved or merely hidden.
GHash profitability being very low for some time wasn't due to block
withholding, it was a bug that some miners abused to get paid for the
same work multiple times. This made it look like a lot of work was done
while finding few blocks.
Block withholding didn't solve the problem back then. And guess what,
those painful days are here right now. China is at 65% and block
withholding isn't solving it.
I was disappointed when GHash got too big and refused to do anything. It
was sad when their miners didn't do anything. Then they used
double-spends to scam a casino. I was shocked that noone cared. Now two
thirds of the bitcoin hashpower is within the control of a single
government. This time I expected noone would care - but I'm still
disappointed. I'm also surprised at the irrational behavior; there are
so many who go out of their way to put their own investments in danger.
For a long time now many miners and pools have been irresponsible with
the hashpower. But block withholding just makes it worse.
