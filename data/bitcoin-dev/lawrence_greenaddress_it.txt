I had the pleasure to meet some of you in Amsterdam and/or to speak on
 but this is actually my first message to the mailing list - I
feel a bit clumsy so apologies in advance if I make any mistake :)
Quick introduction/background: my name is Lawrence Nahum and I'm the
founder of GreenAddress, a BIP32 multisignature service and instant
confirmation platform available in form of web socket APIs and Wallet for
mobile, desktop and web. My background is in CS with distributed systems
and I've worked most of my career in the City on OTC financial services
like confirmation and clearing platforms.
This post is to gather feedback, comments and reviews about a BIP70 payment
protocol proto buffer extension proposal.
If you are interested in GreenAddress design or for more information on
GreenAddress you can find the white paper here
and our homepage on

Agreed, supports_instant is redundant and can/should/will go.
trusted_instant_providers on the other hand I think is needed.
Sometimes the providers will charge fees for instant.
While the software can ignore the fields, users may not want to pay for instant when the merchant may not accept it or care (even if it would not break the protocol it would still be a waste of Does it make sense? Not all transactions from GreenAddress provide double spend protection, there are additional checks on prevout that are normally not done when spending normally, etc

Transactions message sole purpose is to allow easy signing of all i don't think you can serialise a single field
maybe i missed something, not sure
I'll get back to the list with something tomorrow, can be useful in the BIP as an example anyway I guess.
maybe in some different scheme of "instantness" that could be useful, although i wonder if it's possible to keep the BIP simple with such non immediately obvious use cases.
another PKI, not sure, I understand there are already somewhat weak industry schemes to revoke.
I do wonder if there's any better and more "future proof" way.
I'll think about it but for now I hope someone with more experience can share some insight.

providers in the long run and if double spends are resolved then this BIP extension is completely unnecessary.
I am not sure if double spends can be resolved, at the moment they are not and I highly doubt you will see millions instant providers just like I don't see millions Certificate Authorities and I don't see Million Credit Card Any reason you think people will spread trust instead of consolidating of a bunch of instant transaction providers when time is critical?

message might not scale in a world where there are huge numbers of instant-
confirmation providers, but I'm hoping that we never have to scale to that size, because if we did that'd rather imply that Bitcoin has become useless for in-person payments without trusted third parties and avoiding that is rather the whole point of the project :) So I'm OK with some theoretical lack of scalability for now. Hard to say for now. I like the current simplicity but if someone can come up with some use case for other options we should discuss and investigate them. I don't see more than a bunch of accepted payment methods anywhere I ever been in my life, I don't see merchants trusting more than a handful of third parties.
signature of their "instant provider" every time and the merchant just chooses whether to ignore it or not, but as Lawrence points out, this is incompatible with the provider charging extra fees for "instantness". But should we care? I'm trying to imagine what the purchasing experience is like with optional paid-for third party anti-double-spend protection. Ultimately it's the merchant who cares about this, not me, so why would I ever pay?
I think you are wrong here.
Just because up to date credit cards charged the merchant which in turn charged you and the ordinary cash payer doesn't mean a newer and better system can't be transparent from day one.
Ultimately you care because the alternative is to wait.
merchant: after all, I'm honest.
It's quite simple, in a low amounts world people will probably accept zero confs, just like occasionally people can walk out with a bag of crisps without paying from a Pret in London. Guards would cost more than what they'd save from thefts.
With higher amounts they will either not accept bitcoin unless instant confirmed or they will make you wait if that's even feasible (unlikely in a supermarket or petrol station but perfectly fine at the restaurant maybe).
the receiver?who cares about confirmations, not the sender.
You care too: time and money, or just money if you want to use the old details of their instantness provider and we just don't allow for optional selection of instantness. I'm not sure that works, UX wise, so is having a less scalable design to support it worthwhile?
We would not support that I think. Explicit is better than implicit.
We will charge for instant confirmation and wouldn't want the user charged unless pre-agreed, especially if then they also have to wait because the instant tx was not recognized as such.
Yeah we can charge the merchant that can then in turn charge you, we may as well charge you and be transparent about it but also have deals with merchant where they pay fixed amounts per month for unlimited tx and make it free for their users.
Perhaps just like today people ask you which card you are going to use and they may not accept Amex or Diners the same will go for instant and they, the merchants, will just pick the instant provider from a touch screen before allowing the payment in.

this exact scheme. It can solve some kinds of double spends (probably), but others - like ones done by corrupt miners (see bitundo) - can't be solved this way.
I read the comments on the PR. I mean no disrespect but this patch can't prevent double spends minutes apart and a solution is as good as it's weakest link.
It also seems to suffer from potential ddos and otherwise may provide a false sense of security. I wouldn't call it a solution in sight just yet.
case the Bitcoin native double spending protections end up being too weak to be useful. It reintroduces a notion of centralised trust as a layer on top of the Bitcoin protocol, but only for cases where the seller/recipient feels it'd be useful. In this way it gives us slack: if someone is able to reliably double spend and the merchants losses due to payment fraud go up, we can fall back to TTPs for a while until someone finds a solution for Bitcoin, or we just give up on the Bitcoin experiment, but hey - at least we now have a better intermediary protocol than SWIFT I wouldn't put it just like that. Sure, it's a backup to the double spend solution in case we don't reach one - but also, even if you reach some reasonable compromise I assume it won't be instant and instant confirmation between exchanges can create huge arbitrage opportunities and as such It's not really aimed at the merchant but more at service providers and payment processors - or simply, between users that don't know each other in local traders environments/squares, assuming they are ok trusting a known/respected/reputable third party.
Coinbase will think about. Individual cafes etc who are just using mobile wallets won't be able to deal with this complexity: if we can't make native Bitcoin work well enough there, we're most likely to just lose that market or watch it become entirely centralised around a handful of payment processing companies.
What do you expect for e-commerce and escrow to happen? Don't you think the market will naturally converge to a handful of hubs that will helps with refunds and things like that? Or do you expect to just 'trust' all people on  online markets and smaller unknown online shops?
I mean, the beauty of Bitcoin is that it brings much more transparency and the tools to build such things without huge barriers to entry and without using closed protocols - not that it solves _every_ problem.

his node or relayed by mine (there are only two nodes in this little detection network currently), and it does show double spends that occur seconds, minutes or even days apart.
I only meant that double spends minutes apart are possible and that by then the sole use of a monitor is too late even if it will tell you.
thread. Let's all hope it does and discuss the details in some other thread, or on the pull request.
Fair enough.
millisecond counts and you probably don't want to rely on watching transactions propagate across the block chain. For inter-exchange traffic this BIP would probably be useful. I've been talking about the consumer That's quite different, granted.
unnecessary, e.g. when I buy a drink at Starbucks or a burger at McDonalds the chances of me wanting to charge it back is basically zero. Same for sending between people who know each other, large corporate transactions where the threat of a lawsuit is more useful than mediation, etc.
I wouldn't assume that if bitcoin alone (i.e. without third parties) can't be used for medium-high value purchases then it's useless. yes, I'd expect there to be a handful of well known trusted names for the majority of such transactions, and then a long tail of specialists who only mediate e.g. purchases of rare Aztec artifacts or other things where a generic company might be easily fooled.

what we don't?want: a stagnant duopoly of trusted third parties who rampantly abuse their position. So I'd hope we see either (a) nobody really caring about this BIP because Bitcoin gives good enough double spend protection or (b) lots of anti-double-spend providers (hundreds seems fine).
Maybe hundreds, maybe less. I can imagine there would/could be local ones.
It's not the same as credit cards though: it's an open protocol with explicit intent from all parties and no forced fees for normal transactions - just for instant ones.
pointlessly hanging around for an hour. The alternative is to pay by credit card or cash. Outside of experiments there is no such thing as a shop that only accepts only Bitcoin and will require me to wait for a block because I didn't use a TTP to guarantee anti-double spends.
I tend to agree but _today_ people are trying to use bitcoin and are waiting and waiting ..
"here is a proof I won't double spend" is fine, but it doesn't achieve anything if the merchant would have sold me the goods in return for a normal Bitcoin tx anyway, which in practice they always will because this system starts out from zero users and would have to work upwards. I especially?will never use this system if I have to pay for it - I'd much rather just put my money into a wallet that can't generate these proofs and pay the sticker This is a cultural thing. In some places if you pay by cards you pay extra.
I think it may be good to support both models but I like better the transparent one even if I'm going to admit that the least transparent one may be more attractive as it fools consumers.
will give you a discount of X satoshis if you give me a no-double-spends proof. In other words invert it: the sticker price is what normal Bitcoin transactions cost, and then your wallet shows you the regular BIP70 price minus the discount plus the third parties fee as what you finally pay. I compare it to the sticker price the merchant is asking and if it's lower I'm happy, and if it's higher my wallet would automatically avoid using the TTP because I don't want to ever pay more, only less.
lower losses due to double spending fraud.
I think this is worth discussing further. Would love also more input from other people on this.

default, it's useful:
they (again) centralise things by forcing all instant transactions to pay GreenAddress and its competitors money - much though I like your product Lawrence, let's hope they don't collectively lemming us all off a cliff by doing that ;)
I assume we can't enforce to miners rules about which tx will go in and which won't and therefore whether this will cause more or less double I mean, you can try but I would rather have to option to pick an third party instant provider explicitly than  enforce bigger rules on mining which would IMHO lead to implicit centralization.

Updated the BIP draft with an example and a few corrections (like the redundant parameter).
You can see the diff here Allow me to recap BIP changes in discussion:
- making some changes to allow merchants to offer discounts in case of instant ?
- allowing multiple signatures ?
Did I miss anything? Thoughts on the above from others?

is based on your fundamental misunderstanding of miner incentives.
I disagree, I think it is inevitable (but then of course I'm probably biased and why wouldn't I disagree given I run a service that allows for zero confirmation/double spend protection with third party trust.)
Fixing it now avoids having people build on top of very weak/broken foundations (see Coinbase wizards/msg/29818058/) which would cause bigger problems down the line.
One thing I don't understand from your position is how do you propose handling transactions being stuck for days or longer because of low fees?
Even with floating fees you can have a sudden inflow of high fees transactions taking over post broadcasting your transaction.
I also assume restricted replacement is very hard, especially from a UX point of view and adds undue complexity

If Bitcoin is managed with a linux kernel style dictator it would be centralized (yet unlike linux, where people can fork without impacting others in Bitcoin a hard fork puts at risks everyone's bitcoins) - I hope we all agree there is no point in a centralized Bitcoin?
In addition and more importantly, it would put Gavin in tremendous dangers, both from violent threats/blackmailing prospective as well as regulatory prospective - how can you not see that?
I hope all this confrontation will be worth something in the end: to show that Bitcoin can't be changed centrally and that it can't be changed without

FSS RBF is better than no RBF but we think it is better to use full RBF.
We think Full RBF is better for a number of reasons:
-user experience
-code complexity
We think FSS RBF is  great progress but ultimately less efficient and more complicated to keep alive something that never worked properly.
And why would miner pick the option paying less when other miners run the option paying more? It may be soon more than 1-5% of block reward.
A lot of users don't have multiple UTXO handy.
Full RBF is the best, second FSS RBF and we'd be looking into supporting them both separately so that miners and users can pick whichever they If users only had one UTXO it makes sense to use Full RBF since there are no other options.
Disclosure: GreenAddress always believed zero conf transactions are not secure and that miners have the incentive to run FBF; this bias doesn't make the above less true
