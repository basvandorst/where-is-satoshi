Hi all,
Is there any client or code that currently implements BIP 100? And how will
it be deployed? WIll the initial fork be deployed in the same manner that
the max block size changes are deployed described in the bip?

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Questiosn about BIP100 
I have been reading the pdf and one thing I can't figure out is what you
mean by "most common floor". Is that the smallest block size that has a
vote or the block size with the most votes or something else?

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] What is OpenSSL still used for? 
In the release notes for 0.12, it says that we have moved from using
OpenSSL to libsecp256k1 for signature validation. So what else is it being
used for that we need to keep it as a dependency?

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] nSequence multiple uses 
With 0.12 and opt-in RBF, nSequence will have multiple uses. It can be used
for locktime and now signaling for opting in to RBF. However, there is
nothing that I could find that distinguishes the uses for nSequence.
Spending a time locked output requires setting nSequence to less than
MAX_INT but opting into RBF also requires setting nSequence to less than
MAX_INT. By spending a time locked output, you would also be opting into
RBF, which may not be desired behavior. Since using nSequence to signal a
certain behavior will probably be used in the future, is there any plan to
change nSequence so that the features the transaction is using can be
distinguished? Perhaps something like version bits?

Ahh. I see. Thanks, I must have missed that when going through the BIP.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Start time for BIP141 (segwit) 
Can you please explain how having a longer grace period makes it any
safer? Once the fork reaches the LOCKED_IN status, the fork will become
active after the period is over. How does having a longer grace period
make this any safer besides just adding more waiting before it goes
active? You said something about rolling back the changes. There is no
mechanism for roll backs, and the whole point of the soft fork
signalling is such that there is no need to roll back anything because
miners have signaled that they are supporting the fork.

@_author: Andrew C 
@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Start time for BIP141 (segwit) 
But again, how does having a longer fallow period make this any safer?
As was mentioned before, a lot of the wallets listed as WIP have code
ready and tested, just not officially released, so not listed as ready.
It doesn't take 2 months to roll out a software update that is already
prepared beforehand.
I think it's rather odd that no major Bitcoin companies have raised any
such issues with Segwit and in fact many already have the upgrade in the
works. I think it's rather odd that individuals who are not opposed to
segwit would choose to not upgrade even though it has been actively
discussed for the past year.
While flaws can still be found, unlike the DAO, Segwit has been tested
extensively for a much longer period of time. Waiting any longer isn't
likely to help given that so much testing and review has already been
done. Even so, that is a pointless argument as it is impossible to know
whether waiting a little longer would reveal an issue.
Really? How so? It's been active on 4 different segwit specific testnets
and it has been active on the Testnet for the past several months.
People have been spamming segwit transactions and extensively testing
Segwit since its deployment on Testnet. I think we know how segwit
transactions and all aspects of the changes work together as it has been
tested as such for several months now.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] The Soft Fork Deception 
============================== START ==============================
A soft fork means that a transaction using the old rules will still
work. Look at segwit, you can still make the original style of
transactions with P2PK, P2PKH, and P2SH outputs. There is nothing here
to cause a hard fork.
BIP 66's hard fork was not due to the soft fork making transactions
invalid. Rather it was because miners were not properly validating
blocks before building on top of them. That fork was because a
non-upgraded miner created a block invalid under the new rules and
upgraded miners did not check the block and built on top of it. That
invalid block was only invalid because the isSuperMajority mechanism
specified that the new version number must be used otherwise the block
was invalid, and that was what happened: the invalid block had the old
version number. This is not an issue for BIP 9 Versionbits soft forks
because no such rule exists.
In what way have these forks been sloppily deployed? The fork caused by
previous a soft forks (there was only one that caused that had an actual
chain split issue) was due to the isSuperMajority mechanism which is not
a good mechanism for deployment. It has been superseded by BIP 9
Versionbits. Furthermore, that fork was not due to "sloppy deployment"
by the devs but rather due to greedy miners who were SPV mining.
Can you explain what other risks you think there are with soft forks?
If you are reading r/btc, you are doing something wrong.
Like with all soft forks, the only way to revert them is by a hard fork.
Soft forks make previously valid things invalid, hard forks make
previously invalid things valid. In order to revert a soft fork which
made something invalid, you need to hard fork to make it valid again.
No. This is incorrect. There is no requirement to include the witness
commitment in the coinbase if no transactions in the block contain
witnesses. Because transactions that contain witnesses are considered
non-standard transactions by the old rules, if a miner who did not
upgrade continues to follow those standardness rules, their blocks will
not be invalid and they are not forced to upgrade.
Not necessarily, it depends on the change. Most changes (such as
sighashing, new opcodes, different scripts, etc.) can be done via
another soft fork because segwit introduces script versioning. A new
script version would be created with the necessary changes and that can
be soft forked in.
Segwit already is optional. If you don't want to use segwit, you don't
have to. If you don't want to mine segwit blocks, you don't have to.
As for removing all previously soft forked things, then you would be
removing a ton of functionality, various fixes, and potentially break a
large number of transactions that already exists but are not confirmed
yet. This would require a hard fork.
As for what is would be reverted, you would be reverting P2SH (multisig
addresses, you still want those right?), OP_CLTV, OP_CSV, block height
requirement in Coinbase, the value overflow incident, removal of
dangerous opcodes, reduction of block size limit, etc. As you can see, a
lot of functionality and various bug fixes would be lost be reverting
every single soft fork.
As I have said throughout this response, soft forks are not deployed in
a forceful manner which forces people to upgrade.
Great, go ahead. Honestly, I don't think anyone cares about your
"ultimatum". You are a random person on the internet.

Instead of using vanity addresses, the transactions could just use an
OP_RETURN output and express the signalling there.
However, such a system could be easily gamed by people who simply spam
the network with transactions and by miners who choose what transactions
to include in their blocks.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] A Modified Version of Luke-jr's Block Size BIP 
Hello all,
Many people have expressed discontent with Luke-jr's proposed block size
BIP, in particular with the decrease in size that would occur if it were
to be activated prior to 2024.
I have decided to modify the proposal to instead begin the increase
steps at the current 1000000 byte limit. The increases and the time spam
of each increase will remain the same, just that the increase begins
from 1000000 bytes instead of 300000 bytes.
Furthermore, instead of a fixed schedule from a fixed point in time, the
increases will instead be calculated off of the MTP of the activation
block (the first block to be in the active state for this fork).
While this proposal shares many of the same issues with the one it
modifies, I hope that it will be slightly less controversial and can
allow us to move forward with scaling Bitcoin.
The full text of the proposal can be found at
My implementation of it is available at

From what I have observed, it seems to be that people are more so
opposed to a hard fork when there is a comparable soft fork available
than simply opposed to any block size increase hard fork ever. From the
various threads discussing your proposal, it seemed that many would
favor it if it increased over 1 MB sooner or if it never even decreased
in the first place.
Many users are of the opposite opinion, that the block size is too
small. I understand that the decrease is to allow the blockchain size to
grow more slowly thereby allowing users to be more likely to run full
nodes. Unfortunately, I think that we are way past the point of no
return on that. The blockchain is already 100+ GB. Decreasing the block
size is not going to make that any smaller and is not going to make it
any less painful to run a full node. Given that in order to start up a
new full node will still require downloading at least 100 GB of data, I
don't think that decreasing the block size will better facilitate full
node creation. Furthermore, the current trend with ISPs (at least in the
US) is implementing data and bandwidth caps so users are still unlikely
to start up new full nodes regardless of any changes that we can
currently do.
Yes, I know deployment needs to be fixed. I was more proposing this for
comment on the modified block size schedule. I just kept the deployment
as it was originally. However, we could use a modified version of BIP 9
by using one of the top three bits and a longer locked-in period as a
grace period for all users to upgrade.

I looked at the discussions about the block size and about Luke-Jr's
proposal on Reddit and Bitcointalk. From what I observed of all of the
discussions is that few users are in favor of the status quo, and even
fewer are in favor of decreasing the block size. The majority of users
favored Segwit because it was a block size increase (that was a commonly
used reason in support of it and in arguments about increasing the block
Discussions about Luke-Jr's proposal indicated that many users disagreed
with the decrease in block size and the time that it took to increase
again to 1 MB. There was not only disagreement but explicit ridicule and
mocking of that aspect of the proposal.
