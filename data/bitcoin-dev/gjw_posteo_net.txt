@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Moving towards user activated soft fork activation 
What you're describing is a hashpower activated soft fork to censor transactions, in response to a user activated soft fork that the majority of hashpower disagrees with.
It is always possible for a majority of hashpower to censor transactions they disagree with. Users may view that as an attack, and can always respond with a POW hard fork. Bitcoin only works if the majority of hashpower is not hostile to the users.
