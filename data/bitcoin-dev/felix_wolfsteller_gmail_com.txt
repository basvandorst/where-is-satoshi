@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Possible change to the MIT license 
I'd call the license change an attack on bitcoin if its code license
prohibited me to play around with it and call it whatever I the fud I want.
Other entities like companies, goverments and whoknowswhat might
prohibit that (in some countries of the world), but the nature of the
source and protocoll shall be Free (as in free speech).
Even if my code changes are compatible with the current blockchain as
per bitcoin core I would have the lifetime "threat" that one day my code
wouldnt anymore because of changes in bitcoin core, and I wouldnt like
to get letters from lawyers earning their money by sending out letters.
Besides I am not fully sure if I could sign the main assumption that the
forks "... [are] exacerbating the confusion about the very nature of the
project, and harming it in many ways."
Or at least I am not sure that the "harm done" __in the end__ is bigger
than the gains and the proof-of-spirit as well as all the insights
gained through what happens here, regarding Free (well, MIT) Software
out in the world. Yes, its not always pleasant but I think its worth it.

Hey there
Most source files contain the "default" copyright-header (also build by a
script in devtools/copyright_header.py), which points out that the MIT
license can be found in the COPYING file or at
However, the provided link is 1) using http where it could use https, 2)
resulting in a redirect (
I am strongly in favor of using https where possible (I guess there are
many other non-ssl links in the code base, but lets tackle the easier ones
I propose that I
1) create a issue on github,
2) `sed -i` the relevant links,
3) create a PR on github,
4) come back to the mailing list.
This change would affect a few hundred files I guess.
A question remaining is this change would require a
copyright-year-extension (to 2018), too.
An example header can be seen e.g. here
I'd be happy about quick feedback - do not know the culture here, yet.
Have fun

I am a bit disappointed about the feedback (just received one off-list ;)
), but understand now that this mailing list is protocol-only discussions.
So - sorry for that. Anybody interested can follow progress here:
Thanks, Felix
