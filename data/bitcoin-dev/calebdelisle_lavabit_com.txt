Hash: SHA1
Someone I know who runs a moderately large website told me that some ISPs cache DNS for as long as a week without regard to TTL.
If your DNS seeds are not pointing to your own dedicated boxen then you might want to do a lookup on a random cookie as a subdomain.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Seeking advice: Encouraging bug-fixing 
Bitcoin seems to have a relatively unique problem, there is a perception that there are early adopters who still have large stashes of btc.
Not that this is wrong, they knew a good thing early, the problem is that it is hard for someone (me) to justify volunteering work on a codebase which will directly benefit other people even if they do nothing.
As far as trying to bring these people together, I don't have any silver bullet answers but I think there needs to be some kind of sponsorship of developers. I2P uses bounties but they are indeed a small community, I can see bounties going very wrong but I suppose it doesn't hurt to experiment. I think grants for active developers make more sense, then we only need someone to decide who is active enough.
Also moving in the direction of seperating bitcoin the program from Bitcoin the blockchain and accepting patches for merged mining and alt chain stuff which doesn't directly benefit Bitcoin would help decrease the "people are making money off of my back" feeling that (IMO) stands in the way of new developers.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Hosting of compiled bitcoin client 
Another concern is sourceforge being attacked and a backdoored client uploaded.
Most people don't check signatures and I seem to recall sourceforge having some
vulnerabilities stemming from their "your own website on sourceforge" feature.
It looks like Github takes security a little bit more seriously.
Probably the best is to ask for free hosting from a reputable security conscious
bitcoin enthusiast but that basically means Tux and he's already an SPOF in the

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] On-going data spam 
An approach which I see as workable in the long term is to keep the block
header and an array of bitfields representing each transaction's spent
and unspent outputs. When someone wants to spend money you ask them for the
transaction and ideally you ask them for the transaction and the merkle branch
from that transaction to the header. If they want to spend the money they have
to carry around the data.
Agreed on the legality aspect but another case which is worth considering is
what anti-virus software might do when certain streams of bytes are sent across
the tcp socket or persisted to disk. Perhaps worth contacting an AV company and
asking what is the smallest data they have a signature on.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Proposal: MultiBit as default desktop 
Java (Applet) security is indeed abysmal but lets compare apples to apples.
With an applet some random guy with a website makes up some Java code and
your browser automatically executes it.
With Multibit you're only executing highly trusted code (so trusted that it
handles your money).
There has almost never been a Java exploit against secure trusted code.
The idea of discouraging use of java apps just because people would be
tricked into activating the browser plugin when installing the JVM is
probably valid but Multibit is the only reasonably complete client outside
of bitcoinqt and I think client diversity is more important than stamping
out java.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Revocability with known trusted escrow 
IMO this story falls somewhere between rose colored glasses and outright trolling.
Whereas LR was a (relatively shady) company, bitcoin is an entire branch of technology
and research, I can't think of any real caselaw in the US with regards to banning a
technology, perhaps the cryptography export regulation and we all know how well that
worked. Furthermore, the non-reversibility of LR is mostly because they didn't want
to deal with mediation while the non-reversibility of bitcoin is technological barrier.
It seems AmericanBanker has a record of hosting articles which urge policy decisions:
  that would obviously be of personal benefit to the article's author:
  It is the very job of governments to resist the efforts of lobbyists to line their
pockets at the public expense.
While I don't think significant risk of developed countries actually banning an entire
area of research such as bitcoin, I do suspect that bitcoin's popularity lead to LR's
downfall as it will other companies which allow people to transact anonymously.
The tragedy of bitcoin's irreversibility is that it makes kidnap/ransom schemes
profitable. The relative safety of the first world is largely due to the fact that
until now, there has never been any effective way to steal significant amounts of
money. While this problem is serious I don't think it's intractable. Bitcoin offers
us a modeling tool which like never before allows us to experiment with our
motivations and build something better than even bitcoin is today.
I believe regulators are intelligent people who understand this and would rather
legitimize bitcoin than ban it. If there ever were such a ban, I would be more
concerned for the future of the country imposing it than I would for bitcoin.
tl;dr haters gonna hate

If I were a Bitcoin dev, I would not want to talk about anonymity or
TOR because that's likely to attract people with paranoid dilutions
and they're really terrible users to support :)
Also yay for promoting fast, easy to use clients for casual users!

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] A bitcoin UDP P2P protocol extension 
Bittorrent uses UDP in 2 ways and for different reasons.
The tracker protocol is now UDP because large trackers are under such
enormous strain from short lived HTTP connections (40Gb/s) that there
have been instances of upstream routers becoming overloaded from the
storm of SYN, ACK and FIN messages. UDP helps solve that.
The inter-peer protocol is now UDP because TCP does not play nice in
the context of bufferbloat and Bittorrent needs lots of active TCP
connections to work, exacerbating the problem. In this instance
Bittorrent uses a full userspace TCP stack which just sends w/ UDP.
+1 for experimenting with UDP, we might learn some interesting things.
It's worthwhile to actually speed test UDP v. TCP because the time to
send an INV on an established TCP connection with Nagle disabled may
not be significantly longer than that for sending with UDP.
Also +1 for experimentation with sending a small transaction instead
of an INV, if INVs are not being grouped because we want the fastest
possible network propagation, they are mostly overhead anyway. If
b/w is more important than propagation speed then of course TCP/Nagle
is the way to go.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] blind symmetric commitment for stronger 
I can't see this working, if 51% of the mining power doesn't like your
coins, when you create the commitment they will reject it.
If the commitment is opaque at the time of inclusion in the block then
I will create multiple commitments and then after revealing the
commitment and spend to you I will reveal the earlier commitment which
commits the coins to an address I control.
On the topic of reversibility, I suspect in the long term the lack of
chargebacks will create issues as criminals learn that for the first
time in history, kidnap & ransom is effective. Suffice to say after the
first >= $10mn kidnapping-for-bitcoin heist, governments will be forced
to decide how they view the system. It will likely fall somewhere between
"arrest/question anyone identified holding tainted coins" to something
nonsensical and reactionary like "blocking" bitcoin as Iran does TOR.

Ahh thanks for clearing that up, although it would limit the possibilities
of scripting it is silly of me not to think of it.
That is indeed interesting. If I understand this properly Alice commits coins
to pay to Bob and gives Bob the transaction, Bob then commits to pay to Charlie
and gives him the related transaction. If Charlie wants to collect the bitcoin
he then reveals Alice's transaction and Bob's.
I think what you're trying to do is *almost* possible now (ab)using BIP-0016
In the output of the previous tx you put:
OP_HASH160 [20-byte-hash-value] OP_EQUAL
and in the next tx you use a new type of input which specifies it's value but
not the output which is spent. In the input script you place:
OP_DUP OP_1ADD OP_HASH160 [20-byte-hash-value] OP_EQUALVERIFY
Then a serialized script containing the normal stuff as well as the last
transaction hash and output index would be passed around out of band and the
validating nodes would execute each script with a shared stack, beginning with
the out of band one, then the input one (the OP_EQUALVERIFY) then the output.
When the serialized sigscript reaches the bottom of the stack, having been
verified twice, it will now be evaluated as per the rules of P2SH.
None of this probably works in the real world since I'm not familiar with the
actual implementation of P2SH and it probably has quite a number of things
which will break if used this way but it is interesting to see that in theory
it is possible with little change to the protocol (just a new input format).

Not only does the size of the proof grow endlessly as the coin is
passed around, the size of the UTXO set grows endlessly as more and
more of the already spent coins cannot be proven to have been spent
because the proofs are passed out-of-band. I never said the idea was
good, just interesting :)
