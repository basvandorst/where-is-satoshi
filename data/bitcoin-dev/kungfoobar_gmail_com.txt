@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] [PROPOSAL] Merkle tree of unspent 
for serverless thin clients and self-verifiable prunned blockchain.
I've written this proposal. C&P of the overview:
Satoshi's original paper describes a way of prunning spent
transactions in the blockchain to save storage space while it remains
consistent and verifiable, but it's useless for partial blockchain
downloads: while you can know if a given transaction is in the
blockchain, you can't know if it has been spent in a subsequent
This proposal describes how to add a hash-tree based check in the
blockchain that allows to verify if a transaction is unspent without
downloading and checking all the blockchain. The idea is not new, but
at the time of this writing there isn't any technical description of
how this should be done. Aditionally, this solution is rather simple.

I did describe a very similar thing back in January (also illustrated,
and, if I'm not mistaken, more simple and efficient to recalculate),
and I wanted to do a prototype, but I have been very busy with other
projects since then.
I just saw Gavin left a comment in the talk page, I'm sorry I haven't
seen it earlier.
I think armory is the perfect client to implement such an idea. I sort
of waited it to be able to run in my laptop with 2 GB of RAM before
being sucked into other projects. I even lost track of its
I hope this gets developed. I will be able to help after summer if
this is still not done.
P.S: Sorry Peter, I've sent you the message privately by mistake.
Also, I don't quite understand your concern of "unbalancing" the tree.
