@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] String-based Hierarchical Deterministic 
I would like to note that BIP32 and this new proposal have a missing
feature: being able to spend
a coin sent to an address generated by this scheme implies being able
to spend any coin generated
by this scheme.
The easiest deterministic wallet construction is simply to use a
stream cipher to generate random
bytes used as the private keys in a wallet. Hierarchical constructions
do not seem to me to add more,
other then distinguishing transactions by sending to unique addresses,
which could be done by other means.
I read BIP32. And while the multipliers at each level are
unstructured, the ones in the next level are products
of the ones before i.e. we have a multiplication tree with random
looking branches.
Note that the order of the basepoint is prime or a small cofactor
times a prime, so this isn't an issue (usually:
the cofactor could be annoying).

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Fwd: Defeating the block withholding attack 
This attack has an obvious signature: getting outworked on the same
block as the pool was trying to verify, and always by the same person.
So the goal is to prevent the attacker double-dipping by submitting
cycles to the pool, which if he
found a correct answer he could submit himself. I don't see how this
does that: if he finds a valid
block he finds a valid block. Only if the operator has a secret is
this prevented.
This further delays the finalization of a transaction. That's not a good thing.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Fwd: Proposal for a new opcode 
Dear all,
I am proposing a new opcode for the purposes of anonymous
transactions. This new opcode enables scripts to be given proof that
the receiver can carry out or has carried out a previous transaction.
I'm currently working on a paper that discusses using this opcode for
anonymous transactions.
Name: OP_CHECKEXPSIG
Stack before: Stack after: T/F, where is true if sig is a ECDSA signature under pk
for the hash hash. (Hash is the hash of a message).
Uses: Preexisting digital cash techniques relied on keeping track of a
list of turned in notes to forbid double spending. Using
OP_CHECKEXPSIG we can instead pass the script that gives the nth note
value proof that the notes {1,...n-1} were turned in and are distinct.
This enables a coupling of the strong double spend protection of
Bitcoin with traditional digital cash's strong anonymity.

One doesn't use this opcode as the sole thing to secure a transaction.
Instead this opcode prevents double spend attacks against
anonymization schemes. The idea is for Alice to give signatures to the
recipients of funds, all signatures being equivalent. To avoid this
from leading to a double-spend, we use a quorum method based on
showing earlier redemptions happened.
Because you can't blind a lamport signature, it isn't. I'm searching
for a place to post the current draft: it's not ready for anything
official yet, but does seem to be of interest. Drop me a (offlist)line
if you have ideas about where I can put  it.

-My protocol works, your's doesn't. It's not enough to have a mix, the
mix needs to be verifiable to avoid
one of the mixers inserting their own key and removing a key that
should be in there. That doesn't mean you can't make your protocol
work with some more magic, but magic is required.
-You need a lot of online computation: the recipients need to be
involved with validating the mix. By contrast in mine you need to wait for
enough people to get their bitcoins to avoid partitioning. But this
might be a strength,
not a weakness.
-You avoid the problem of de-anonymizing through having the protocol
run incompletely: if the permutation is correctly computed the
transaction goes through.
-You also avoid all the problems with modifications to the bitcoin
clients and miners.
It's definitely a good alternative, once you fix the problem in 1.
On a related note, private keys and signatures have better proofs of
knowledge then hashes. Has this been considered in the P2SH
conversation? There might be ways to use this to make even better
methods for enhancing anonymity.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Payment Protocol Proposal: 
After doing more thinking, what about letting a spend sign more information
associated with the transaction, such as a transaction ID provided by the
merchant? This seems to solve a lot of the problems being put forward, with
much less complexity.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Presenting a BIP for Shamir's Secret 
This is not the case: one can use MPC techniques to compute a
signature from shares without reconstructing the private key. There is
a paper on this for bitcoin, but I don't know where it is.
