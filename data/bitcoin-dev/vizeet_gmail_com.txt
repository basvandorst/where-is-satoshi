I feel it is breaking a principle that if a transaction is valid it remains
valid. There might be dangerous repercussions to breaking that rule. For
instance chain of transaction become invalid which might lead to losses.

I see one benefit which i am looking for. I may not need to use all public
keys in p2sh script instead i can use p2pkh and retrieve funds by using
threshold number of keys..so in case i loose a public key along with
private key i still may have other public key private key pairs to
retrieve. For me it sounds interesting. I need to understand how it is
going to get implemented in more detail.
