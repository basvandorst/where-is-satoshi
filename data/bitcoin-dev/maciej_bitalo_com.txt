@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Proposal: remove "getwork" RPC from 
Will removing "getwork" from the client impact the "setgenerate" RPC call?
I.e. would you still be able to generate coins on testnet-in-a-box this
way, or would you need a dedicated miner for that? testnet-in-a-box is very
useful for testing and easy to setup, it would be great if it stays that
way :).

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Way to tell that transaction was issued by a 
As far as I know current Bitcoin protocol doesn't let you to include any
arbitrary data with the transactions (as it would become non-standard and
clients would not relay it). So if you have multiple addresses you can't
sign them with a single private key and include that signature in the
transaction so other party can verify it against your public key. This
could become very handy though - a reputable wallet service could issue
transactions that require zero confirmations from the other party,
because with the added signature they know that the transaction is from
this reputable service and they trust that this service won't try to double
spend. I'm thinking of something like Mt.Gox's "green address", but baked
into protocol (Mt.Gox does this by sending your funds to some known by the
others Bitcoin address and then relaying them to the final destination).
Do you think it's possible/feasible to add a feature like this to the
current protocol without forking the chain? This could be as simple as
adding support for following scripts:
 OP_DROP OP_DUP OP_HASH160  OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECK
 OP_DROP OP_HASH160  OP_EQUAL
The  should not be longer than 34 bytes (or more, depending if
we want to have some room for future use cases). This is all that needs to
be changed in the Bitcoin client. Now for actually using the feature a
further definition of  is required:
22 AC 20 <32 byte signature>
22 is data block length and "AC 20" is just a sub-opcode that can be either
defined by the protocol (in this case I'm reusing OP_CHECKSIG's opcode but
that's not required since this is all part of data block) or just agreed
upon between people that want to use this feature.
It's possible that the above could be achieved in some simpler way using
other opcodes or mechanisms present in Bitcoin protocol that I'm not aware
of. Either way, I'd like to hear your opinions whether a feature like this
should be considered and added.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Standardizing OP_RETURN message format 
So, OP_RETURN is here and there is no coming back. So if we have it, it
would be nice to actually make use of it in a good way. I would like to
write a process BIP with a proposal for standardizing OP_RETURN
transactions for better interoperability between services. Right now there
are no guidelines for crafting these transactions, so everyone just does
what he believes is good for him.
What I would propose is a common, extensible protocol that can be used by
anyone. The generic format would be like this:
OP_RETURN OP_PUSHDATA[length] {2-byte message type} {data}
So basically, we would have a list of message types, that can be then
parsed by everyone because the format is open. It could go like this:
MSG Type | Parameters | Description
00 00 | unknown | Unused type, use it if you don't want to share your
message format with others
00 01 | none | Proof of burn transaction. Use it if you want to effectively
destroy coins (by sending it all as fees to miners)
And so on. I have few more ideas for these kind of messages, but it will
only work if we try to make it an open standard, hence the BIP idea. Can I
expect that it will be included with other BIPs if I write it?
