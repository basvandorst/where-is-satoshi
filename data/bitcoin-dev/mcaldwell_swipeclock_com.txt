@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Monetary Authority for Bitcoin 
For what it's worth, once upon a time I pushed this agenda on Bitcointalk.  I'd say early 2011 or so.  The response I got was so strong and unanimous in favor of this point being absolutely non-negotiable that if the money supply were anything other than fixed, Bitcoin may as well be pretend e-dollars.  I was not just persuaded against it, I was put in my place.
I believe that if there ever becomes a consensus that Bitcoin's inflation parameters were a show-stopper for the Bitcoin economy, that the power to correct it lies with merchants, who would vote for changing the rules.  I believe they would do this not by changing Bitcoin, but by accepting, in parallel, a brand new alt coin that reflects the consensus as to how the inflation should be.  I believe such an alt coin would have its genesis at around the time that consensus moved toward accepting inflation, rather than adopting the seignorage of some other alt coin out there today.

It is not a violation of the trust of those holding the currency. Many people bought Bitcoin in the hopes that it's value in the relation of other currencies will increase, not because there's a fixed money supply. The majority of people using Bitcoin as a currency in exchange for real goods are using the exchanges.
 My proposal will still allow for 4.9% semi-weekly variations in the price of Bitcoin, allowing for it to appreciate 11,800% per year.
Ryan, you can stop there already because any change to the inflation
formula (supposing such a thing is even possible, which it's not)
would be a violation of the trust of those holding the currency, who
obtained it while believing that its inflation algorithm would not

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] BIP 38 
Hey everyone,
I have noticed that there was a recent change to BIP 0038 (Password-Protected Private Key) on the Wiki, which is a proposal I wrote in late 2012.  Gregory, it looks to me as though you have made this change, and I'm hoping for your help here.  The change suggests that the number was never assigned, and that there has been no discussion regarding the proposal on this list.
I had this number assigned by Amir Taaki in November of 2012, consistent with what I understood the procedure to be at the time by reading BIP 0001 on the Wiki.
First off, I want to confirm that when I send to the list, that there isn't a technical reason it's not getting to everybody.  I believe I most recently mentioned BIP 38 to this list on August 17, 2013. (EDIT: seems my prior messages, including an earlier revision of this message, have not made it to the list)
Secondly, in the case that it is deemed that this has never been properly submitted, discussed, or pushed forward, I'd like to propose that this happen, and request help with the formalities where I'm lacking.
I believe BIP 38 is a valuable proposal that is seeing real-world use.  BIP 38 allows people to create private keys (including paper wallets) protected by a password, and also allows one party to select the password for paper wallets to be created by another party.
Real-world use includes a working implementation at BitAddress.org, one at Bit2Factor.org, implementation by Mycelium, and others.  Also, others are informally using it as a sort of abbreviated escrow scheme where a buyer and seller agree on the buyer maintaining control over the release of funds.  In short, it would be terribly confusing to reassign the number BIP 38 after already having had an established meaning for the better part of the year, particularly on what appears to be procedural grounds.

No problem, thanks for providing the IRC recap, and glad I've finally made "radio contact" with the list.  Perhaps there can be some long overdue discussion on the topic.
I see Kogelman's improvements to my proposal as being of merit and may very well be sufficient to supersede what I've originally proposed.  I suppose the main thing I'm wanting to ensure is that the identity of my original proposal is maintained.  Regardless of whether a paper wallet or physical bitcoin with a single address is poor form or whether my proposal is rejected or superseded, I hope there can be a consensus that "BIP38" can continue to be understood to mean "Password-protected private key proposal by Mike Caldwell", and that it can appear in the lists of BIPs alongside others.
Regarding "BIP 22"... I in fact did not originally attempt to post to the list over what I had created and called BIP 22 once upon a time, I literally just created a wiki entry contrary to advice in BIP 1 that I had not read at the time.  I recognize it's totally legitimate to feel and act upon the appearance that BIP 38 was created in a similar shortcut fashion.  Certainly, the next thing I propose will be in the form of a draft outside the BIP "numberspace" and I won't solicit a BIP number without an established consensus in the future.  That said, I'm asking for BIP 38 to stand and be recognized as in existence, so as to not confuse those who call it by that name and who have already chosen to do something with it (whether that's to implement it, or to draft improvements to it like Kogelman).
If I did BIP 38 over again, there's a couple shortcomings of my own that I wouldn't mind seeing addressed in another iteration, and the right venue for that may very well be to contribute to Kogelman's work.  My particular improvements might include wanting the ability to outsource the computationally expensive step to another service at a minimized risk to the user, potentially the ability to have special-purpose "encrypted minikeys" (sort of how ARM has Thumb for places where the tradeoff makes sense), and a typo check with better privacy (I currently use sha256(address)[0...3] which may unintentionally reveal the bitcoin address, if it's funded, to someone who has the encrypted key but doesn't know the password).

Greetings, (repeating from our discussion on IRC)
No prior messages about your proposal have made it to the list, and no mention of the assignment had been made in the wiki.
The first I ever heard of this scheme was long after you'd written the document when I attempted to assign the number to something else then noticed something existed at that name.
Since you had previously created BIP documents without public discussion (e.g. "BIP 22"
 [...] Or, I wonder did your emails just get eaten that time too?), I'd just assumed something similar had happened here.
I didn't take any action at the time I first noticed it, but after someone complained about bitcoin-qt "not confirming with BIP38" to me today it was clear to me that people were confusing this with something that was "officially" (as much as anything is) supported, so I moved the document out.  (I've since moved it back, having heard from you that you thought that it had actually been assigned/announced).
With respect to moving it forward: Having a wallet which can only a single address is poor form. Jean-Paul Kogelman has a draft proposal which is based on your BIP38 work though the encoding scheme is different, having been revised in response to public discussion.
Perhaps efforts here can be combined?

As someone who has put a lot of thought into how to best help typical everyday people understand bitcoin, I strongly favor 1 bit = 1e-6 BTC as being very straightforward to explain to non technical types, and also XBT as one "bit".  "There are a million bits in a bit coin" is highly intelligible to average people. I consider overload/conflict with existing meanings of "bit" as a non-issue for typical population at large.

It is a paradigm that is easy to explain and grasp for neurotypical people. The average mind has no problem overloading words and distinguishing the intended meaning from context. For most people, overloading a single syllable word with a new meaning is much less complicated than using a unique 3+ syllable word like satoshi or micro-anything.
Doing software development warps our minds to demand fully qualified names for everything. We know our compilers would say "bit? Fatal error 0xaaabbbbwtf, can't continue, not sure if you mean a Boolean or a dog bite".  But this peculiarity should not be projected onto the people we are trying to get bitcoin to appeal to, not if we want them to feel like we think about their experience. If I were to say "a Bitcoin can be divided into a million bits", less than 0.1% of average joes would think I was talking about German beers or the thing that goes in horses mouths. Really, most people are good at using context to relate this to "a dollar can be divided into 100 cents" and accepting it.  This requires much less of their mind resources than using SI prefixes correctly or learning 3 syllable words that (to them) have no instantly apparent relationship to Bitcoin. Sent from my iPhone

Mainly because it is short, memorable, effectively leads the listener to infer the proper meaning, is culturally neutral, is easy to say by speakers of just about any language, and many other reasons. Sent from my iPhone

By culturally neutral I mean we avoid deliberately invoking a cultural reference in the name.  For example "satoshi" would be a reference to Japanese culture just for being a common Japanese name regardless of who Satoshi turns out to be. Sent from my iPhone

My impression:
Good because it is short, memorable, and pronounceable by speakers of most languages (though to most of the world that would be oo-bit, as "u" being "yu" is mostly an English thing)
Downsides include the fact that ? is not a U, it just resembles one. It is a lowercase M in Greek, a live spoken language also studied by many, and calling it a U conveys a notion of global unawareness. And the potential for "XBT" to be 1e-6 BTC on the world stage would be huge, worth pursuing.

What about "ubit", pronounced "YOU-bit", representing 1e-6 bitcoin? Easy to say, tied in a visual way to the metric micro, leaves the required 2 decimal places for the marginally numerate.. What more could one want?
Also, hi. My first post; plan to get involved over the southern hemisphere winter if I can learn enough.

If bit had to be preceded by a letter I would nominate "ebit" or "xbit" (which could still be XBT)
Those needing a definition for x could define it as "coin/1000000".
That said, I am still more in favor of "bit". Xbit would just solve the problems others cite about ambiguity if they had to be solved without the resulting name being too long.

Something tells me this would be reduced to a single syllable in common usage I.e. bit.
My 2 cents goes for "bit".
Because: Bitcoin is a digital currency, BTC starts with "bit", "bit" refers to a small amount of something in its regular english usage and lastly 99.9876543% of people on the planet don't know what a digital "bit" is yet ...

I agree with the sentiment that most people don't understand either computer science or Bitcoin.  The goal of getting people to understand enough about Bitcoin to use it is achievable and a goal that is "in scope" of our efforts. Getting them to understand computer science at large at the same time, less so.
The fact that people routinely confuse RAM and hard drive sizes has much to do with the fact that the average lay person has little need to prioritize this as something to keep in the forefront.  They don't get "horribly" confused, they just simply don't get worked up over what looks to them like a rounding error, much to the dismay of anyone who believes that everyone should be an expert at computer science.  The average joe may assess (accurately from his perspective) that the distinction isn't important enough to merit significant mental resources and he is justified in not expending them that way even if someone else thinks he should.
Poor understanding is precisely what a proper effort to name this would be to avoid.  It is not frill or aesthetics, it is a planned targeting of language to achieve the clearest communication to the widest possible target audience using the language most likely to be understood by them in light of our objectives.  It's marketing. Sent from my iPhone
