Who would be the best person to interview who could explain this issue and
I'd like to get an audio segment for the Let's Talk Bitcoin show ASAP, as
this will be a big concern for many users who will not know what to do or
be able to understand the problem.
Any volunteers for a 15 min audio interview in the next 2 days?

There's a difference between storing the content itself, and storing just a
hash to content (which however is not spendable payment). I undertand why
content itself doesn't belong. But it goes too far to say that only
payments should be allowed.
If the fees are not enough, fix the fee structure, don't stop incredibly
innovative and promising uses of the distributed timestamping database.
That is definitely throwing the baby out with the bathwater. If the issue
is size, then address that, rather than the content itself.
Have I misunderstood this discussion or are some proposing than nothing
except payments be allowed?
Discriminating based on transaction content violates neutrality of the
protocol and in my mind removes a very very large possibility of future
innovation. If bitcoin is a *platform* and not just a payment system, then
it needs to be neutral to content, like TCP/IP so that other protocols can
be layered. Solve the size problem itself, without picking and chosing
which uses of bitcoin are good and which are "bad" or "spam". I think it
risks killing a tremendous amount of innovation just as it is starting.
Again, I think it is extreme and extremely restrictive to say that ONLY
payments are allowed.
Can you explain this part or refer me to some docs? What do you mean by
"coinbase", I assume not the company.
Thanks for the reply and explanation!

Is there any consideration given to the fact that bitcoin can operate as a
platform for many other services, if it is able to be neutral to payload,
as long as the fee is paid for the transaction size?
Unless I have misunderstood this discussion, it seems to me that this is a
bit like saying in 1990 "IP Is only for email, the majority of users want
email, we shouldn't allow video, voice or images". Ooops, there goes the
Is it possible to solve this by solving the issue of provably un-spendable
outputs without foreclosing on the possibility of other types of
transaction payloads (ie, not money), that would open the possibility for a
myriad of layered apps above? For example, hashes of content that is
external to bitcoin, that people want to pay to have timestamped in the
blockchain, as provably unspendable outputs.
The social compact is to accept transaction for fee. I think it is a major
mistake to make decisions that discriminate on the content of the
transaction, saying that some uses are not appropriate. If the fee is paid
and it covers the size of the transaction, why would it matter if it is not
a payment?
I could be totally misreading this thread, too, so please allow me some
slack if I have!

Nicholas Weaver is reporting that pools have already started delaying
blocks, something that hints at Selfish Mining, since Nov. 3rd.
He dismisses other reasons for delayed block propagation.
Any ideas on whether pools are already mucking around with block delaying
I have no idea if this report is accurate or explained by some other issue
in the network, does anyone here have a comment on this?
