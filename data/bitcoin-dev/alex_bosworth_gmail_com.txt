@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Extending BIP174 for HTLCs 
I've been experimenting with a format tag for BIP 174 to help support
HTLC scripts I've been working with.
Not sure on the best format for this, but what I have been thinking
about is a new input type that defines elements that should be
inserted in the final p2sh/p2wsh stack such as a preimage or a refund
path flag.
Type: Additional Stack Element ADDITIONAL_STACK_ELEMENT = 0xXX
Key: The index in the stack to insert a value (uint32 LE)
{0xXX}|{Stack index}
Value: The value to push into the stack for a redeem script or witness
script at the specified index.
So my flow is:
1. Create blank PSBT (attaching locktime, anticipating final weight to
adjust outputs for fees)
2. Update with redeem scripts and/or witness scripts
3. Update with sighashes
4. Sign: generate partial signature
5. Attach additional stack elements for the required non-signature elements
6. Finalize to create the final scriptsig and/or witness
7. Extract the signed transaction for broadcast
This may be overkill or overly generic, has anyone else thought of how
to use PSBTs in an HTLC context?
