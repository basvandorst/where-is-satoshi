While Peter Todd's public mention on social media was likely meant to be
disparaging, I'll take the contribution of adding 'data mining' to the
title in future updates of the draft - thank you.
It might be ironic that he posted the remark on Twitter, where his message
will be aggregated and sold by twitter to data miners.
Twitter made $48m last year from selling data to data miners, at a 95%
growth rate on year-on-year basis. It has since spent $130m on buying a
data mining business who specialise in understanding how to mine data in
order to grow this part of their business. It is one of their more
profitable sideshows.

-> The original proposed date for the fork was December 2015. It was pushed
back to January as December is a busy period for a lot of people and
businesses. Likewise, June is a busy period for people. July / August is a
good period as it is quiet because people go on holiday. A window of 2
months during holiday periods is better than starting in June. January 2016
is better, mainly because of the excessive reward halving chatter likely to

Unless I misunderstand the proposal, you would have to factor a way to deal
with miner cartel behavior. A few emails every week and the larger miners
could collude to set prices.
With that figured, then your voting proposal could be triggered by a moving
day block average which takes into account capacity for any given period,
plus a level of headroom for unexpected spikes. The issue with this is
forward planning is more important, especially when the moving average is
longer than a week.
Credit card providers and retailers use a number of factors to plan for
capacity on a regional basis. From previous years figures, long-term
weather forecasts, annual calendar events, one off events, etc. A global
currency can't use many of these tools for forward planning.
E.g. religious holidays are among the biggest events for transactions; if
we take Christmas, your proposal could work out a capacity during a quiet
period in November leading to a downward adjustment which then sees
transactions getting maxed out during the two weeks before Christmas eve.
You could then have an upward adjustment, but people stop spending on
Christmas day.
These are human factors that need to be considered.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP 104: Replace Transaction Fees with Data, 
In response to public and private comments and feedback, we have updated
this working draft.
Update highlights:
1. Specific clarifications on replacing the Coinbase subsidy and
supplementing *and* not replacing transaction fees.
2. Clarification on block chain overhead. The value of data mining is on a
bell curve, so year six data will be removed every year.
3. Added references to an ability to create global, national and regional
Bitcoin Price Indices for popular baskets of goods transacted with Bitcoin.
4. Added references for an ability to use structured block chain data for
Bitcoin capacity and fork planning.
5. Removed references to price speculation.
6. Added preferences for deployment dates of January 2017 or January 2018.
7. Moving towards BIP format after discussion and evaluation period.
Technical content will increase in due course and discussion content will
be removed.
Further views and feedback welcome.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP 10X: Replace Transaction Fees with Data, 
Thank you for your comments. We will address them in the next update.
Privacy is an area you have been championing for many years and your input
in this area has created the environment for Bitcoin to exist. Anonymity is
not something we would be willing to compromise, despite the general
public's endless willingness to give away their intimate life histories and
contact details to Facebook and other social media.
If you have the will to read a longish response, we have tried to expand a
little on the rationale for the type of data we believe will be useful and
valuable, in addition to broadly addressing the privacy issues.
Arguably, the greater the cryptographic protections on the ownership of a
transaction, the more value will be placed on the nature of transactions.
Without wishing to frame the conversation on specifics or particular
sectors, here are some distinctions to address some of the previously noted
Orwellian fears on attaching identity markers to Bitcoin transactions.
* We have no desire to create tools that can analyze which brand of baked
beans Bob may prefer compared to Alice. That is a matter of extreme detail
for supermarkets, their suppliers and internal point of sale systems.  When
you make a store purchase, your basket of goods are wrapped up in a single
payment which appears on your credit card or bank statement. Knowing on an
aggregated basis that people spend around $120 / week on retail shopping
and that Saturday is the busiest period for that activity is more valuable
for payment processors than knowing the contents of Bob's basket of goods.
As a retailer or supplier, I would buy that data in order to plan
inventory, marketing budgets, promotional activity, staffing levels,
logistics, factory production, bank borrowing, store expansion planning,
* Now consider petrol. Bitcoin is very well suited for fuel purchases,
especially for small independent petrol filling stations. Aggregated data
would help the entire supply chain that serves the consumer, if businesses
at the front end had access to data for when demand was at peaks and
troughs. Extend that from individual petrol stations to regional, national
and international consumer purchases and you have the basis of the market
pricing oil based on demand per period and per country. Again, we don't
care that it is actually Bob who fills up every Sunday so he has enough
fuel to last him the week or to track him along his driving holiday.
* Now consider remittances. While the global headlines are that it is a
$500bn a year industry. Few people know that remittances are based on a
relatively small number of remittance corridors that make up the bulk of
the market.  These corridors are based around people leaving small towns
and villages in poor areas and travelling to work in locations based on
knowing someone or a family member who used to live in their area and are
doing well in xyz location because they can see the beneficial impact on
the recipients quality of life. At the coal face, remittances are a word of
mouth grey market sector and part of the reason that WU and the like can
charge so much is because the last mile of remittances are in areas where
monetary infrastructure and logistics are difficult to serve and they can
get away with setting high prices. They prosper because they use data to
organise themselves better. Banks have no desire to serve this market
because you end up clogging up branches every Friday or Saturday with
people that transact relatively small sums compared to those that are
banked and get annoyed waiting. Having access to Bitcoin transaction data
on this sector would help Bitcoin businesses to understand the end points
of this market and serve it better and focus their promotional activities.
We have no desire to identify that Bob's cousin Jos? is working illegally
in Texas.
These are three sectors where there are millions of small businesses that
would, for the first time, be able to access global, national and regional
industry data figures typically reserved for large businesses due to the
high cost of acquiring or commissioning research.
While increasing anonymity or having zero knowledge proofs in transactions
is desirable so that I can keep my Bitcoin salary payments private and my
membership of Ashley Madison out of the news, it would be helpful to know
that when I want to spend my salary that the world around me is organised
enough to serve my needs.
The block chain is ledger. It will contain a global data set that could end
up being one of the most valuable databases in the world. Why not use it to
fund Bitcoin's security infrastructure and growing bandwidth challenges?

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIPS proposal for implementing AML-KYC in bitcoin 
I would prefer not to download an attachment.
Generally and without having the benefit of reading your document, AML and
or KYC requirements are treated on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis.
You would probably need to factor obtaining a universal agreement between
all of the governments and regional enforcement bodies of the world on the
nature and scope of an acceptable set of policies before attempting to
attach rules to the protocol. Clearly, when one country unilaterally places
politicians of another country on banned lists and vice versa, for example,
would create some problems with implementation and automating checks
against banned lists produced by each country.
While you could apply a 'home rule' approach, you would be pushing
regulatory controls down to individuals transacting between each other
without having to go through any regulated intermediaries. This means you
have no way to enforce KYC or verify that the details are correct unless
you create a system of third party checkers in each country who would
enable transactions to proceed. To overcome all of this you would probably
need some identity verification system in place first and to add extra fees
into the network to pay for the maintenance of the system.
As has already been pointed out, the above would lead to individual coins
being tainted with previous ownership details creating the possibility for
blacklists rendering some coins worthless and creating the possibility of
these coins being passed on to unsuspecting users. All this goes against
the spirit of monetary systems, so you are back to regulating end points as
and when users come into contact with regulated entities.
Lastly, it might be worth knowing that criminal liability can be placed on
individuals responsible for implementing AML and KYC procedures and
policies that do not work or allow criminals to circumvent the systems of

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Open Block Chain Licence, BIP[xxxx] Draft 
Thank you. We hadn't seen that before.  It is an interesting discussion.
We did think about including some references to protections for private
keys while they remained in your control and you could prove as much. In
theory it should be no different to dropping money on the floor. The money
still belongs to you, even if someone else comes along and finds it. The
onus of proof is on you as the owner to demonstrate private keys are yours,
but you also need the goodwill of the person finding the money.
However, this raised a number of issues including whether finding private
keys attached to coins and moving the funds constituted theft, in which
case there are already criminal protections if you are able to track the
coins to an individual. We decided not to include anything specific in the
draft licence to keep it simple, relying instead on the generic definitions
of rights to *private transaction data* of which private keys would come

That is a very good point.
We considered whether data existing before a licence change would be
covered, but we hadn't factored the potential need for gaining permissions
for a change to be considered effective.
We have proposed that miners be the main beneficiaries of licensing and
there is a consideration on whether they should vote to adopt the new
terms. While not the preferred route, that would overcome any issues to
what is an otherwise honest 'error and omission.' There doesn't seem to be
anyone who could claim to have suffered any economic losses so this may not
be an issue. It merits further investigation.
The block chain is in perpetual change, so the sooner a change is agreed
upon, if at all, the more data it will cover without any reservations. At
any rate, we believe the changes would be considered effective on a
retrospective basis.

This is good feedback. Thank you.
Very briefly:
The block chain is a database. There are laws to protect databases. We have
suggested who might be best placed to be assigned rights to the block chain
and more importantly why.
about saying you have a right to something and you give up those rights.
There are likely to be many examples where this could be applied, for
example - if you transact with someone and government agencies develop the
means to reveal your transaction, a licence gives protections which might
otherwise not be there in the absence of a licence. The MIT licence does
something similar - the Core developers give up their rights to revenue
from the software. Not wishing to go down rabbit hole, why not just remove
the MIT licence?

produce some guidance and context to assist with the BIP discussion
process. If anyone else has any suggestions on wording or access to legal
advice, that will be helpful.
to display the block at their web site"  I would oppose any wording that
attempted to do anything of the sort. Bitcoin works because the block chain
is in the public domain. We have included references to royalty free use of
the data.
 The original reference client did everything. A block chain licence was
probably not envisioned. Mining has taken a different path from that which
was intended. Nevertheless, one needs to start somewhere. The proposal to
assign rights to miners is just that, a proposal.
I would just like to labour the point that users pay to use the network,
but they have no defined rights, anywhere.

It is probably for us to do some further investigations and possibly engage
