Here is a BIP draft for improving the block relaying and validation so that it can be done in parallel and so that redundancy can be removed. This becomes more beneficial the larger the block sizes are.

Do you mean getdata? Here is the reason for the 6 new messages:
getseginv,seginv - These are for learning about what segments of a block a node has. Else you could remove these messages and simply have nodes advertise blocks via inventory messages. In this case nodes would have to wait until they had fully received a block before relaying anything. No longer is there a benefit with nodes being able to relay segments of blocks before they have received the entire block.
gettreelevel,treelevel - These are to received a level of the merle tree. Instead you might use get data but gettreelevel is more compact than get data and is clearly differentiates itself as part of the new protocol. Perhaps these messages could include the block headers alongside the hashes and you could request many at once like with the getheaders message? If you skip these messages, then you could verify the transactions at the end but there would be problems when peers give bad segments where data would need to be downloaded again.
getsegment,segment - These are clearly important to request and receive segments for the blocks. These allows for nodes to download arbitrary segments of blocks. The optimum number of segments could be calculated by node software using measurements of download speeds and latency times, the number of connections and how likely redundancy is to occur. If a node is up-to-date and likely has many of the transactions in blocks, it can start asking for the deepest merle level (tx hashes) and ask nodes for segments, avoiding transactions it already has.
I'll get around to doing measurements myself sometime to estimate the benefit of this proposal. It will certainly be beneficial when block sizes reach some size but not much is really known except what can be assumed/guessed.
I should also mention the bitcointalk topic here:

For some reason sourceforge is not sending me updates anymore but I can see the replies online?
There could be a slightly more simple protocol which gives all the transactions hashes and nodes can then download the transactions separately. However there are two problems:
1. Downloading all the transactions individually might be inefficient. My proposal will allow nodes to request multiple transactions at once.
2. Why not add a few additional components to the protocol to allow requests for any level of the merkle tree? It's not very complicated at all and protects against the future.
Sure, analysis needs to be done to see at what point the proposal would give benefit and I will hopefully get around to doing some measurements of peer behaviour to aid with this.
I think it's a good idea to think ahead rather than only do what is beneficial for the network currently. The block sizes at the moment are about 0.1MB but what if the bitcoin demand starts pushing that into megabytes? And yes the ~0.95MB limit needs to be changed in order for bitcoin to grow that far. Why would the limit not be lifted? How will bitcoin demand be satisfied other than having large fees to deter transactions, hoping the fees are large enough to balance the demand with the block size limits to prevent many transactions being unconfirmed and annoying users? That limit has got to go eventually. And then it could be that block sizes do become large enough to worry about the performance in relaying.
Best not to leave this to the last minute, so at the very least I think it's good to talk about this.

You wouldn't need to pipeline the requests, just place more than one inventory vector in get data, right? Well my messages would save the space of those inventory vectors. Instead of needing 36 byte inventory vectors for each transaction and a var int, you would need two var ints only. And then the transaction responses only need one header, so you save 24 bytes for each transaction after the first. You could say that is a small benefit.
Well it depends on wether you seriously think bitcoin blocks should be limited at a million bytes or not.
Look at bittorrent. With bittorrent you don't download files from a single peer all at once.
Why wouldn't requesting minimum fees in the software work as is done currently?
So what you essentially suggest is having bitcoin banks that maintain trust through Open Transaction contracts which contains proof of agreement, providing some legal protection? One wonders why have bitcoin at all then? Why not have an elaborate e-money system between several banks using Open Transactions? Bitcoin doesn't just contain proof of if something was done right or not, it contains actual certainty that it will be done right. And how does Open Transactions prevent fractional reserve fraud?
I suppose when people consider bitcoin banks, they will consider bitcoin being useless.
Set the change to occur at some block in the future leaving time for people to upgrade. Send out alert messages to notify users to upgrade. Issue is, some people might not like the change for whatever reasons.
As far as I see it, if bitcoin won't scale, then it's worth looking at something different to bitcoin that will scale.

Sure other things may be done before this, I was seeing this as a change somewhere down the line but not urgent.
Yes, my proposal allows you to do this. You skip out transactions your already have. My proposal is simply better than others because it takes full advantage of the merkle tree structure with minor additions that are simple to implement. How hard is it to get the hashes at a particular level of a merkle tree? Not hard at all. How hard is it to place a selection of transactions from a block into a message Not hard at all. Implementation of the protocol requirements would be a piece of cake. The harder bit would be to create an algorithm to determine the best level of segmentation but this is not required to comply with the protocol.
The motivation to incentivise miners and maintain stronger security? The difficulty only has to be high enough to prevent a cartel of malicious miners taking control of the network, something that is potentially a problem today with the large mining pools. Remember that the more transactions there are the more fees there can be for miners to collect. The more people that are using bitcoin, the greater bitcoins will be worth. A bigger network should be good for miners when relying on fees.
If it's so controversial that it creates a split making two separated currencies then I'd see it turning out like the format wars (VHS vs Betamax and Blu-ray vs HD-DVD). Eventually people will move towards one or the other since it's better for people to have universalised agreement on a system.

Obtaining a particular tree level allows you to verify segments without needing to download all the transaction hashes first. You only need one hash per segment. For instance if you want to divide the block into 8 segments you specify level 3 and download 8 hashes. You could download all transaction hashes if you wanted and it would still work, it just requires more data transfer for the hashes. This was the reason why merkle trees were used in bitcoin, to avoid requiring all hashes to verify data.

A merkle tree root is found by hashing the two children together and those children are found the same way until you get to the greatest level down the tree. This means you can validate children as being correct as long as they hash together to form the root. This means you do not need all the transaction hashes to validate segments of the block, you only need the root hashes for all the segments you want. Let's say there are 8 transactions and you want to verify 4 segments (2 transactions each), The merkle tree looks like this (Might not work depending on the font):
Level 0:               *
                      / \
                     /   \
                    /     \
                   /       \
                  /         \
                 /           \
                /             \
Level 1:       *               *
              / \             / \
             /   \           /   \
            /     \         /     \
Level 2:   *       *       *       *
          / \     / \     / \     / \
Level 3: *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *
When you look at any non-leaf node you can see a separate merkle tree where the root can be found exactly the same as any other merkle tree. In this example you want four segments, so you ask for level 2. Now imagine a tree without level 3, you can validate the root with level 2. In fact you can validate that the root exists for any level. So you first check that the level 2 hashes do indeed calculate to the root. Once this is done you can now use these hashes to validate the segments. When you receive a segment, you check that segment against the segment's root. So you've validated the segment transactions for the segment root and the segment root was validated for the entire tree's root. You validate the segments for each segment root and this way you know all the transactions are valid for the four segments and thus are valid for the entire tree. This way you have downloaded 4 hashes instead of 8. Downloading the transactions hashes are therefore not necessary only the level for the segment roots. You might for instance want to divide the block into two segments in which case you ask for level 1 and download 2 hashes.
I hope that made sense.
And yes the merkle tree is particularly useful for validating a single transaction exists in a block as that saves a large proportion of the data required. The redundant data removed in the proposal here is smaller as a proportion of the total data (Because most of the data is the actual transactions themselves), so you might argue it's not worth it but it's simple to implement.

This is not fully correct. I propose downloading the roots of the segments when you are not looking to remove redundant transaction downloads. This would be the case when the node is not up-to-date and is unlikely to have transactions in the required blocks. When a node is up-to-date and can benefit from removing redundant transaction downloads it can switch to downloading all the transactions hashes by specifying a high level number. Also I wouldn't recommend using one thread per connection, I'd recommend using one thread for all connections.
This isn't what I was suggesting. I was suggesting you only need to download one level. Once you have done that you verify everything for the hashes on that level.
Well you will need to ask for the headers first. Once you do that you can start downloading the full blocks for the headers.  The node should use "get blocks" to find nodes with segments of the blocks they need. Now for each block:
1. Send getsiginv to a number of peers to know the segments of the blocks they have. 2. Send gettreelevel requesting a level of the merkle tree from a peer that can provide it. When up-to-date use a high level to get the transaction hashes to find redundant data.
3. Validate the treelevel response
4. Send getsegment for each segment wanted (at the same time where possible) to the peers that have these segments. Skip transactions already known.
5. Validate the transactions in each segment received. Stop if the block is invalid and disconnect peers that give transactions which do not fit the merkle tree.
6. Revert to getdata if peers using the protocol cannot satisfy the block download.
When a valid block segment is received, include the block in inv and headers messages for other peers using the protocol. Thus relaying can begin before the entire block is downloaded.
I'm thinking about improvements to this proposal. I'll get to that tomorrow perhaps?
Thank you everyone for the replies.

Well let's hope something like "murder black people", "stupid asian person" or "whip african slave" doesn't come up. :-) Maybe it would have been better without the aggressive words?

I removed some more but I haven't added enough back in. It was taking far longer than expected so I gave up, but maybe someone else can try to add some more:
