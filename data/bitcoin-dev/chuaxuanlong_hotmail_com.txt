@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Optimization of Codes for Electrum 
Dear Bitcoin-Dev,
I?m writing in to enquire on the post ( and I?d like to seek your help and understanding on the codes you modified in order to optimize the syncing of blockchain. For instance, the functions that you modified/variables/values that may lead to a better performance. I?m currently working on further optimising Electrum in terms of syncing and any help will be greatly appreciated.
Thank you and I really look forward to your prompt reply soon.
