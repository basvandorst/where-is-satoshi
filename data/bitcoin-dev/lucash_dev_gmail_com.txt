This is my first post to this list -- even though I did some tiny
contributions to bitcoin core I feel quite a beginner -- so if my idea is
stupid, already known, or too off-topic, just let me know.
TL;DR: a trustless contract that guarantees minimum profitability of a
mining operation -- in case Bitcoin/hash price goes too low. It can be
trustless bc we can use the assumption that the price of hashing is low to
unlock funds.
The problem:
A miner invests in new mining equipment, but if the hash-rate goes up too
much (the price he is paid for a hash goes down by too much) he will have a
Solution: trustless hash-price insurance contract (or can we call it an
option to sell hashes at a given price?)
An insurer who believes that it's unlikely the price of a hash will go down
a lot negotiates a contract with the miner implemented as a Bitcoin
Inputs: a deposit from the insurer and a premium payment by the miner
Output1: simply the premium payment to the insurer
Output2 -- that's the actual insurance
  There are three OR'ed conditions for paying it:
  A. After expiry date (in blocks) insurer can spend
  B. Both miner and insurer can spend at any time by mutual agreement
  C. Before expiry, miner can spend by providing **a pre-image that
produces a hash within certain difficulty constraints**
The thing that makes it a hash-price insurance (or option, pardon my lack
of precise financial jargon), is that if hashing becomes cheap enough, it
becomes profitable to spend resources finding a suitable pre-image, rather
than mining Bitcoin.
Of course, both parties can reach an agreement that doesn't require
actually spending these resources -- so the miner can still mine Bitcoin
and compensate for the lower-than-expected reward with part of the
insurance deposit.
If the price doesn't go down enough, the miner just mines Bitcoin and the
insurer gets his deposit back.
It's basically an instrument for guaranteeing a minimum profitability of
the mining operation.
Implementation issues: unfortunately we can't do arithmetic comparison with
long integers >32bit in the script, so implementation of the difficulty
requirement needs to be hacky. I think we can use the hashes of one or more
pre-images with a given short length, and the miner has to provide the
exact pre-images. The pre-images are chosen by the insurer, and we would
need a "honesty" deposit or other mechanism to punish the insurer if he
chooses a hash that doesn't correspond to any short-length pre-image. I'm
not sure about this implementation though, maybe we actually need new
What do you guys think?
Thanks for reading it all! Hope it was worth your time!

Hi, guys.
Thanks a lot for taking the time to read and discuss my post.
I definitely wasn't clear enough about the problem statement -- so let me
try to clarify my thinking.
First, the main uncertainty the miner is trying to protect against isn't
the inefficiency of his new equipment, but how much new mining equipment is
being deployed world-wide, which he can't know in advance (as the system is
Second, there are two different metrics that can mean "profitable" that I
think are getting confused (probably my fault for lack of using the right
- Let's call it "operational profitability", and use "P" to denote it,
where P = [bitcoin earned]/time - [operational cost of running
   Obviously if P < 0, the miner will just shut down his equipment.
- Return on investment (ROI). A positive ROI requires not just that P > 0,
but that it is enough to compensate for the initial investment of buying or
building the equipment. As long as P > 0, a miner will keep his equipment
running, even at a negative ROI, as the alternative would be an even worse
negative ROI. Sure he can sell it, but however buys it will also keep it
running, otherwise the equipment is worthless.
The instrument I describe above protects against the scenario where P > 0,
but ROI < 0.
(it's possible it could be useful in some cases to protect against P < 0,
but that's not my main motivator and isn't an assumption)
If too many miners are deploying too much new equipment at the same time,
it's possible that your ROI becomes negative, while nobody shuts down their
equipment and the difficulty still keeps going up. In fact, it is possible
for all miners to have negative ROI for a while without a reduction in
difficulty. Difficulty would only go down in this case at the end of life
of these equipment, if there isn't a new wave of even more efficient
being adopted before that.
Let's see a simplified scenario in which the insurance becomes useful. This
is just one example, and other scenarios could also work.
- Bitcoin price relatively constant, that is, it's not the main driver of P
during this period.
- Approximately constant block rewards.
- New equipment comes to market with much higher efficiency than all old
equipment. So the old stock of old equipment becomes irrelevant after a
short while.
- All miners decide to deploy new equipment, but none knows how much the
others are deploying, or when, or at what price or P.
- Let's just assume P>0 for all miners using the new equipment.
- Let's assume every unit of the new equipment runs at the same maximum
hashrate it's capable of.
Let's say miner A buys Na units of the new equipment and the total number
deployed by all miners is N.
A's share of the block rewards will be Na / N.
If N is much higher than A's initial estimate, his ROI might well become
negative, and the insurance would help him prevent a loss.
Hope this makes the problem a bit clearer.

Sorry, Eric, but I think you're completely missing the point.
It has nothing to do with sunken cost -- but the fact that the mining
equipment is good for nothing else other than performing hashing operations.
As long as someone can get paid more than they spend to keep the equipment
running, i.e. P>0,  it will keep running.
Your argument only makes sense in an ASIC-free world.
Let's assume you decide to just shut down your whole operation. In that
scenario, it doesn't make sense *not* to sell your equipment, even at a
loss. Just destroying it makes no economic sense: your loss would be much
worse. So you'll sell it -- at a loss -- to someone who will buy it at a
price that will make *their* ROI>0 for keeping the equipment running --
and the equipment *will* be again running, and *will* keep the hashrate
high. Only consequence of you shutting down your operation is you taking a
Even if you sell it to someone who will run it exactly as efficiently as
you, or even at lower efficiency (as long as P>0), they'll just pay less
for the equipment than you did, their ROI will be >0 and you'll bear the
loss. No drop in hashrate.
Hashrate can only respond to mining being unprofitable in the sense "P" --
not in the sense "ROI". But a miner can still go bankrupt even if P>0.
Please note that none of the above breaks the economic assumptions of the
protocol. The problem I'm talking about isn't a problem in the protocol,
but a problem for miners -- and it's the same as in many kinds of economic
Consider investing in building an oil refinery -- if the price of the
refined products get lower than expected to pay for the capital, but still
high enough to pay for operating costs, you'd rather keep it running (or
sell to someone who will keep it running) than just sell the parts as scrap
metal. In that case you might want to protect yourself against the price of
the refined products going too low.
Of course miners can (and maybe already do) hedge against these scenarios
using other kinds of instruments -- most likely facilitated by a trusted
3rd party. I'm just interested in the possibility of a new, trustless
*Anyway* I'm far more interested in the technical feasibility of the
contract, given the economic assumptions, than it's economic practicality
in the present.
