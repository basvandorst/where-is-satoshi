I like this a lot. It's very simple to understand and would be very
easy to implement and set up.
"Sure, send it to david.bitcoin.se".

I'm not sure I get your point. If someone tells you "hey, check out
the web page at xkcd.com", is that your response or do you just open
up your web browser and type "xkcd.com"?

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Pull request for translation - who reviews it? 
Hi all,
I posted this question on the forums but got no answers.
I'd like to make some improvements to the Swedish translation of the
client. I understand the technical side of making a pull request etc.,
but will my request be accepted? There aren't many people in the
project who can judge if the Swedish translation is good or not, so
will it simply be accepted if noone opposes it?
Previous Swedish translations seem to have been commited by codler, is
this person "responsible" for the Swedish translation? Related to
this, is there anywhere I can see a list of people who have
permissions to make a pull?

I probably won't be on IRC but...
A couple of months ago I mentioned the possibility to get free advertising
for open source projects on StackOverflow. Perhaps this is the time to do
it, we could make an ad specifically for windows developers. See this:
Shouldn't be a problem for us to get 30 votes with some help from the forum.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Should we get some free advertising on 
Hi all,
StackOverflow has something that they call "Free Vote-Based
Advertising for Open Source Projects". The way it works is that a
suggested 220x250 pixel ad is posted here:
As soon as it gets 6 upvotes or more it will be included in a rotation
of ads displayed on the right hand side of the StackOverflow site.
"It must be an advertisement soliciting the participation and
contribution of programmers writing actual source code. This is not
intended as a general purpose ad for consumer products which just
happen to be open source. It's for finding programmers who will help
contribute code or other programmery things (documentation, code
review, bug fixes, etc.)."
I remember Gavin talking about the need for testers (I don't know what
the need is for developers). Anyway, we could target the ad towards
whatever we need. If you think that this is a good idea, please post
some ad suggestions in this thread. Please don't post the suggestion
on StackOverflow just yet since we're not allowed to have multiple ads
for the same project and we'll want to make that ad a good one.
