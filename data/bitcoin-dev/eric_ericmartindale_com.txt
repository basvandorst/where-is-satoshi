We need to make it so mind-numbingly simple to "run Bitcoin correctly" that
the average user doesn't find reasons to do so in the course of normal
use.  Right now, Coinbase and Bitstamp are winning in the user experience
battle, which technically endanger the user, and by proxy the Bitcoin
Multi-sig as a default is a start.  It won't succeed unless the user
experience is simply better than trusted third parties, but we need to
start the education process with the very basic fundamental: trusting a
third-party with full access to your Bitcoin is just replacing one
centralized banking system with another.

This is toying with the economics of cryptofinance in a way that needs to
be understood before being put under consideration for implementation in
Bitcoin.  This is an opportunity for an altcoin to explore the implications
of these proposals prior to changing the properties of an already
precarious system.

One variation of this, "recycled address", might avert misconceptions that
the "re-use" is exclusive to one's own identity.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Ramping up with bitcoin core engineering? 
The Bitcoin.org Development Guide has grown by leaps in bounds this year,
and has two great introductions:
1.  for an overview of how a developer
can contribute,
2.  for in-detail reference to
how the whole system works.
Other great places to get involved or find more detail include the Bitcoin
Wiki  and the  room on
Freenode .
Hope that helps!

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP: OP_PRANDOM 
You should take a look at OP_DETERMINISTICRANDOM [1] from the Elements
Project.  It aims to achieve a similar goal.
Code is in the `alpha` branch [2].
