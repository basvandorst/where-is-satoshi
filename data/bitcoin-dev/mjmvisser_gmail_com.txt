[n00b alert]
I humbly suggest allowing the wallet.dat location to be specified in the preferences. Being able to easily physically disconnect a wallet by unplugging a USB key seems like a good idea.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Roadmap for autotools / Qt gui merge [Mac 
Hi everyone,
I spent some time today with the bitcoin-qt client and autotools on mac. The qt client builds and runs with a few small changes (mostly just  boost/filesystem/operations.hpp in a few places).
Autotools + qt will take a bit longer. I've got something *almost* working, but I won't have a chance to finish it for the rest of the week. I'll push the changes to github tomorrow (Monday) so anyone else can take a crack at it if they so wish.
