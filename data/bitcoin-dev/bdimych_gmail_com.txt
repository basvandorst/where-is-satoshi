@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Block size possible solution - to set minimum size 
As I understand the main problem of the fork Core<->XT is possibility
of double spending:
-I run XT and spend my coins
-it is written in 8mb block
-Core does not accept this block
-I run Core and spend my coins again
-it is written in 1mb block
-but XT accepts this block too
-in the XT blockchain both blocks [8] and [1] contain my coins
I thought that possible solution can be to set minimum block size
2016: 1mb <= blockSize < 2mb
2017: 2mb <= blockSize < 3mb
2018: 3mb <= blockSize < 4mb
Free space could be filled with zeroes and compressed.
That's all, just an idea.

I apologize, I'm not familiar with technical details, may be stupid,
only general thoughts:
-overlapped block sizes - two blockchains, uncertainty, unpredictable
results, trust gets down
-non-overlapped - single blockchain, determined growing, everybody
knows the schedule what and when will happen
You wrote "cheated",
but why?
If it will be possible to fill with zeroes
[transactions]+[miner's dummy transactions]
why the second variant will be better for miner?
and why it will be not good for other users?
