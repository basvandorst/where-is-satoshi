Hi Melvin / Mike,
Ive been working on Bitcore and Insight next to a BitPay team for the last
few weeks. We are happy to receive patches, suggestions and bug reports
from you guys at:
Insight also provides some blockchain query capabilities at its
REST/Websockets API described on the Readme document.
Please note that Insight is meant as a software package that you can
download, install and use next to a trusted bitcoind instance.
live.bitcore.io / test.bitcore.io are just demo installations.
