@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP proposal: Increase block size limit to 2 
This is a good point. The rollout procedure needs to be fully tested
*before* any changes are enforced.
Has anyone provided conclusive results on system load demands with an
increase to 2MB? Extrapolating further to higher blocksizes will also be
useful to get an idea of the scope of the problem. If the system does jump
to 2MB it is unlikely that will be the ultimate limit so 4, 8, 16 etc...
should also be quantified.
We already hear of the high system load (energy/cost) requirements* for
nodes under the current blocksize which appears to have created a barrier
to entry for a lot of miners. If increasing to 2MB makes it even more
expensive in terms of hardware and energy costs to run a node that will
consolidate the nodes into the control of a few wealthy parties who can
afford to run the most powerful hardware. Conversely if the increase helps
the system and individual nodes run more efficiently then that would be a
big incentive for miners to upgrade.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Clearing up some misconceptions about full nodes 
This is very useful information but from my experience it is not viable to
have a full node running full time on a desktop system i.e sharing the
system with a normal desktop workload.
With a very powerful "Desktop" machine bitcoin-qt dominates CPU/GPU
resources. Surely the majority of nodes NOT running open ports are being
run on desktop systems.  It's likely that the vast majority of the
"normal/desktop" user base are not going to setup dedicated machines to
run a full node full time.
It's likely that the vast majority of full nodes that are not running open
ports are used occasionally when the user wants to make a transaction or
"catch up" with the blockchain.
That creates a divide between those who do have the resources to
contribute to the system on a full time basis (minority) and those who do
not (majority).
Does the power of p2p decentralization lie with the vast majority or the
"wealthy" resource rich minority?
How will the move to 2MB hard fork affect the vast majority of nodes?
For example Debian unstable currently provides the following:
apt-cache  madison bitcoin-qt
bitcoin-qt |   0.11.2-1 |  unstable/main amd64
   bitcoin |   0.11.2-1 |  unstable/main Sources
The rollout affect of the hard fork on the entire bitcoin ecosystem is a
difficult process to plan in advance. It's not viable to simply rely on
press releases to encourage users to upgrade their nodes. The debacle with
Pulse Audio during the mid 2000's should be a lesson for those who seek
that route.
Compare that to the requirements for spinning up "bitcoin-2.0" and
enabling users to move their wallets to the new blockchain at their
The ecosystem doesn't suffer from instant degradation. Bitcoin "brand"
loyalty will ensure that users who want to move forward with the economic
potential of the 2MB blocksize will be able to keep their existing funds
safe while testing the waters with the new blocksize.
After all Bitcoin is still the only game in town when it comes to scale
and proven history of financial return.
As the new blockchain builds momentum the old one will eventually become
obsolete. However it may also become the digital equivalency of Silver and
that is also a useful, profitable and viable alternative with a proven
history of success.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Hardfork to fix difficulty drop algorithm 
Bitcoin is a success.
The success has forced various hardfork discussions.
Hard forking is contentious. If a softfork cannot be achieved the
alternate to a hardfork is creating a new bitcoin. ex bitcoin 2.0
Similar to silver, gold, palladium, etc...
Bitcoins success partly stems from it's brand awareness. Any new
officially supported bitcoin will also benefit from this brand awareness.
If the market values the new improved bitcoin they will put their money
into it. This doesn't require any consensus.
Let the market decide which option has the most value. If everyone
switches to the new bitcoin then the old bitcoin miners will follow.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Why not archive the backend of Bitcoin blockchain? 
You can already use the "prune" flag to get a snapshot of the blockchain
but it is incompatible with "txindex" and "rescan" so maybe that is and
issue for lightning nodes?
