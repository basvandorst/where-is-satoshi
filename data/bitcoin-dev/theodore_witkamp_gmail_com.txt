@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Release priorities for v0.4? 
I am a Berkley DB ignoramus , but how is specifying the wallet file
path different than using a symlink?
Also I think that allowing the user to open more than one wallet helps
the user develop an intuition for the system.
A simple task like opening transferring coins from one to the other is
currently very awkward on the same installation.
