Hi Mr. Lee Chiffre,
I have been working on an implementation of addrv2 (BIP-155). Is this what you meant by I2P and Torv3 address support?
My WIP pull request: Merged BIP: Ongoing discussion: Note: Even though the pull request to the BIP repo is merged, we?re still discussing some details in the pull request thread and will amend the BIP once it seems like we?ve worked out all the kinks
Review and further discussion is very much welcome! :-)
