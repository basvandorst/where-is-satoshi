That's a very good quest. It was one of the reasons why we ruled out namecoin, but not the only one.
Although in principle it is a similar concept to namecoin + PGP, in practice at least for our device, that felt like a hammer to crack a nut, "How could this operate if the device was carried to one of the non-3G countries i.e. with no direct internet access? How could we syncronise the chain in a low bandwidth environment, if at all? Could at least some of the chain be pre-loaded at the factory? What would the risks be if it was?". These are just a few of the practical considerations that we are addressing, and our feeling is that when we can get the proposed distributed ledger to work properly at "the lowest common denominator" level, then everything above is easier. On one other point, I don't ever see the Bitcoin software using a second blockchain, like namecoin, in order just to provide safe communication of a non-face-to-face, person-to-person, pay-to address (far too many hyphens), but I do see some other standard emerging that provides the equivalent of BIP70 for this use case.  In this context, when we posed these questions, "Why do we have to provide a reward for a ledger of information? Why do we have to wait for confirmation when no money is at risk? What is the worst that can happen if your device key is discovered or replaced?", it did not make sense to include all the incumbent coin stuff just to arrive at a distributed ledger for a set of ultimately disposable keys.

The code will be available as soon as we are ready, and apologies again for it not being a more meaningful conversation - I did say I hesitated about posting it ;)
I think it is fair to say that we have not assumed anything about other technologies, without asking if they can answer all (not just some) of the questions I raised. I have yet to be convinced that anything existing meets those requirements, namecoin included, hence why we are looking at creating an alternative (non-coin by the way) but this alternative has some  of the important properties that the distributed ledger provides.
To answer the question about expiry, we're looking at something we'll call proof-of-life for the device keys. In a nutshell on of the pieces of information stored with the device public key will be a last heard from date - a date which is sent only by the device from time to time. Records that are expired are devices that have not been heard from for a given period (to be decided). As the device keys are not related to the Bitcoin keys it will be safe to expire a device key by default. An expired device would require reinitialisation, which would make a new device key set, a new proof of life date and then the Bitcoin keys (BIP32) can be restored. Chris D'Costa

Hi Daryl
I think the two issues with this are
1) pay to addresses are not fixed - ie you can have a different address for each transaction (which is why BIP70 is necessary to allow per transaction addresses via https.)
2) unless you are already aware of the  public key of the signature, you do not know if the signature is made by the person you think it is supposed to be from. See recent concern over fake key for Gavin Andresen. Ie a signature can always be verified with a valid public key, the question is was it the real person's key. That is what WoT tried to resolve with so-called "signing parties", nowadays keys posted to a public forum by a known user, but it's not a standard and not ideal.

Hi Daryl
Ok I thought you were suggesting wrapping the URL in an additional PGP  signature.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] "bits": Unit of account 
I have a rather off-beat suggestion. Perhaps decimal was not satoshi's intention.
In old English money 1 guinea is 21 shillings. I wonder if 1 million guineas is more or less the total number of bitcoins = 21 million shillings. There was also the notion of bits (two bob bits = 1 florin = 2 shillings). I quite like the idea as it's absolutely not expected.
Old English money is a funny mix of decimal and imperial (base12) measures but may have some interesting properties, one of which would be to have multiple names for overlapping "layers" not just the 2 or 3 that has been mentioned here and elsewhere.
I wonder in the long run if this will not just naturally occur anyway.

This is probably the best, most complete resource available for those who
don't want to (or don't know how to) wade through the code. Well done.

Hello I wonder if I could be granted access to post to the dev list. My project is the Meek hardware wallet, and we are working on a solution to avoid MITM attacks when communicating a pay-to information over a non-secure transport mechanism.

Security of transmission of person-to-person pay-to addresses is one of the use cases that we are addressing on our hardware wallet. I have yet to finish the paper but in a nutshell it uses a decentralised ledger of, what we refer to as, "device keys". These keys are not related in any way to the Bitcoin keys, (which is why I'm hesitating about discussing it here) neither do they even attempt to identify the human owner if the device. But they do have a specific use case and that is to provide "advanced knowledge" of a publickey that can be used for encrypting a message to an intended recipient, without the requirement for a third-party CA, and more importantly without prior dialogue. We think it is this that would allow you to communicate a pay-to address to someone without seeing them in a secure way.
As I understand it the BlockChain uses "time" bought through proof of work to establish a version of the truth, we are using time in the reverse sense : advanced knowledge of all pubkeys. Indeed all devices could easily check their own record to identify problems on the ledger.
There is of course more to this, but I like to refer to the "distributed ledger of device keys" as the "Web-of-trust re-imagined" although that isn't strictly true.
Ok there you have it. The cat is out of the bag, feel free to give feedback, I have to finish the paper, apologies if it is not a topic for this list.

The idea was not to register profiles or any human identity, or associate it with any other identity directly. Neither was it to have a massive BlockChain, or use proof of work. In this case proof of work is detrimental to security - you want as many people to know about your keys as quickly as possible. I want to add that this implies a shadow p2p network.
Also it's just a point if view, but I thought it better not to have any specific link to a person's identity, or their Bitcoin "identity" by which I mean no connection to their public addresses. The device keys are not meant to be a permanent identity or to store encrypted data either (think what happens if the device changes hands), so the use case is only to establish secure communications, and to verify signatures whilst still in use by the owner. A new owner would need to establish a new device key - again this is in the details and probably more specific to the project.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Let's kill Bitcoin Core and allow the green 
I think the "Kill King Bitcoin - Long Live the King" call is somewhat
inevitable, and we should expect this to happen from time-to-time, now that
the cat is out of the bag.
However, I fully agree with Adam that livenet is probably not the place to
play this game, and I'm also not convinced that testnet is either.
I often wondered if there is any appetite for a no-holds-barred, anything
goes, bitcoin fork that would allow for the kind of valuable
experimentation that Peter R is suggesting? This is a different concept
than an alt-coin because it would be undoubtedly unstable until consensus
is reached - and that is the whole idea. It hopefully would inform future
decisions about what gets rolled into Core. One problem I see with doing
this, is the lack of incentive.
