Interesting. I think the original BitDNS discussion was more interesting
that what currently is happening with namecoin, see
Satoshi said there: "1) IP records don't need to be in the chain, just do
registrar function not DNS.  And CA problem solved, neat."
Besides, ICANN is currently selling out the global public namespace - not
that anybody really cares about such measly topics as the ownership of
global namespaces. And so some guy on the Cayman Islands is now the largest

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] "A Transaction Fee Market Exists Without a Block 
Very interesting paper. When you talk about a market, what are you
referring to exactly? A market means that demand and supply are matched
continuously, and Bitcoin has no such mechanism. A lot of discussion has
been around fixing the "supply" of blocksize. A floating number would mean
that a hardcoded number or function would be replaced by a decision process
involving users (demand). I don't think a fee market exists and that demand
or supply are not easily definable. Ideally supply of transaction
capability would completely depend on demand, and a price would exist such
that demand can react to longterm or shorterm supply constraints. In such a
scenario there would be no scalability concerns, as scale would be almost
perfectly elastic.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] trust 
keep everyone honest by keeping the ledger open and publicly available.
Trust takes many different forms and is not a binary function. You trust a
surgeon to do an operation and a pilot to fly a jet, but not vice versa. To
trust someone explicitly, you need to know who they are. Most social
structures work without explicit identity and they still function quite
well. For example companies are mostly anonymous to the consumer - if you
buy something in a shop you trust a chain of people producing that good. A
priori there is little reason to trust others, but rather that trust is
already developed through social institutions. Money is one such
institution with specific trust problems, and the history of money is
indeed a very good way to study these problems. Unfortunately in Bitcoin
development such insights are rare to find.
Lightning assumes explicit trust and ID - much like Ripple. That's not
going to work, and I'm surprised that someone with basic knowledge of
crypto doesn't see this problem. Having explicit counter-parties is
something very different from Bitcoin where the entity doing transactions
verification is unknowable and changes all the time. Users of Bitcoin trust
nodes doing the verification because they know it is in their best interest
to be honest. Neither Sidechains nor LT have preserve that important
property, and so IMO there are no good proposals to make Bitcoin scale (if
that is possible at all).

How do you know who is who online? If Alice and Bob want to transact and

Certificate authorities and trust them. If you have non-cooperative hubs
they could flood the network and make it unusable. And why should hubs
cooperate? There are no incentives in the system.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] User vote in blocksize through fees 
This is a misguided idea, to say the least. If such a mechanism of of
user input would be possible, one would use it for transaction
verification in the first place. In proof-of-stake outcomes are
determined by vote by stake (that vote has very different
characteristics than vote by compute power). There is no such thing as
making it possible to determine what "users want". That's what the
proof-of-work mechanism does in the first place, only that it is now
unfortunately skewed/corrupted/(whatever you want to call it). Before
centralization the concept of "miners" didn't exist in Bitcoin and
miners were roughly identical to users. Peer-to-Peer implies only one
class of users.
A big problem with such a vote (in PoW and PoS): miners get paid for
their work and have incentives to raise fees. Those who pay fees would
have no say in whether those fees are fair or not. Transaction
verification has to be roughly profitable, but there is no fixed
formula for determining profitability.

Exactly right. Bitcoin does not have a free market for fee though, and
literally all the discussion so far has neglected some fundamental
aspect of this, as you described. It's not at all a "technical" or
"engineering" decision. It's the question of how to potentially
re-design a fundamental part of Bitcoin, and the proposals so far
don't address this. What is the price of the scarce resource of the

"And it allows the minority to hold the majority hostage"
The Bitcoin protocol has no definitions about developer consensus .
The reference to FOSS is quite arbitrary. The alternative of lobbying
companies is equally indeterminate and arbitrary. One of the core
problem is that you can't poll users about features, and even if one
could users are unlikely to be able to make design decisions about the
system. Voting is a quite imperfect mechanism. IF there would be a
hardfork vote of this kind, at least each party should lay out a
longterm plan and proposal. Mike and Gavin don't have any plans to
implement new scaling facilities and Lightening is not a coherent
proposal. In effect this fork battle would not be part of a BIP
process, but a vote on a longterm plan/architecture.

How is that different? The only difference is in who makes the fork

have garnered through Bitcoin for their purposes (malicious or not).

Yeah, but increasing block-size is not a longterm solution. Necessary
higher fees are a logical consequence of lower subsidies. Bitcoin was
basically free to use at the beginning because miners got paid with
new coins at  the expense of those who already hold coins. Eventually
there needs to be a mechanism which matches supply and demand.

"Thus we have a fixed capacity system where access is mediated by supply
and demand transaction fees."
There is no supply and demand. That would mean users would be able to adapt
fees and get different quality of service depending on current capacity.
For example if peak load is 10x average load, then at those times fees
would be higher and users would delay transactions to smooth out demand.

There is no ensured Quality of service, is there? If you "bid" higher, then
you don't know what you are going to get. Also because you have no way of
knowing what *others* are bidding. Only if you have auctions (increasing
increments) you can establish a feedback loop to settle demand and supply.
And the supply side doesn't adapt. Adapting supply would help resolve parts
of the capacity problem.

hmm? if the current ask for 1 ounce of gold is 100$, then you need to bid
100$ to get 1 ounce of gold. If tomorrow everyone agree 1ounce of gold
should be worth 200$, then the bid moves accordingly. of course production
changes based on prices. otherwise the economy would not function. if price
of some stuff goes up, more people produce that stuff. in terms of a price
for a transaction and the use of a blockchain, unfortunately there is not a
way to just add computational supply. that's an inherent weakness of how
blockchains are structured. ideally it would be as simple as demanding more
resources as in scaling a webservices with AWS.

I agree that naive scaling will likely lead to bad outcomes. They might
have the advantage though, as this would mean not changing Bitcoin.
Level2 and Lightning is not well defined. If you move money to a third
party, even if it is within the constrained of a locked contract, then I
don't think that will solve the issues. Blockchain does not know about
offchain and moving between offchain and onchain requires liquidity and a
pricing mechanism. That is exactly the problem with side-chains. If you
have off-chain transactions on an exchange, they are ID'ed in their system,
subject to KYC/AML.

"You open a channel with a hub and through that channel send coins to

Define hub *precisely* and you will find there are
some significant problems here.
a) does everyone know each other in the network? In Bitcoin transacting
parties exchange keys out of band. How do I know that Alice is owner of a
pubkey? I don't, and if don't know Alice I'm out of luck and can't transact
with here (or trust another PKI).
b) hubs need incentives. There are not going to put up collateral just for
c) how is complexity reduced? I would speculate that most transactions are
one-time transactions in the time frame of days.
LT is a very interesting idea, but far from actual implementation.

It still isn't perfect.  Everyone has an incentive to wait until the
last minute to pledge. <<
AC does not solve the problem. AC works if people gain directly from
the payment. Imagine a group of people paying tax - nobody gains from
paying it. You have to actually need to enforce negative outcomes to
enable it (jail for tax fraud). Hence in Bitcoin we have the enforced
subsidy. AFAIK the problem of how to incentivize transaction
verification without subsidy is unsolved. Who determines a fair price?
People around here should study more economics, game theory, etc.
instead of debating low level encodings all the time.

explain this ?announcement?? Just a few comments on this ?proposal?.
?This new construction establishes a security profile inherently superior
to existing methods of rapid transfer and settlement, and is directly
applicable to other problems within existing financial institutions.?
First of all, what does Bitcoin have to do with existing financial
institutions? Secondly, what in do you mean by ?rapid transfer? and
"settlement"? Bitcoin is anonymous, digital cash. There is no such thing as
settlement, there is only the transfer of digital cash and that's it
(settlement is a bad word for this kind of transfer of property). If you
make up new terms define them accurately and don't play the
crypto-buzzword-bingo game.
?This, in addition to increasing the security of funds normally subject to
explicit counterparty risk, fosters conditions that increase market
liquidity and reduce capital requirements for on-blockchain business
Again ? what does Bitcoin have to do with ?market liquidity? and ?capital
?Blockstream's innovative solutions are definitely a game changer for the
Bitcoin industry.?
Does Blockstream have commercial products now?
"These initial launch partners include Bitfinex, BTCC, Kraken, Unocoin, and
Xapo, and discussions are underway with another dozen major institutional
traders and licensed exchanges. "
??? so many questions and no answers.

I would be helpful to describe what is meant by "votes". As far as I
understand this would be a semi-automatic process - nodes encode values
which in turn are hardcoded in software, or is this completely automated
without any intervention at all? Is there the possibility that nodes decide
by encode votes, but somehow this decision is not adhered to? Is 4. a 51%
Under 2. it might make sense to specify values in the range (1MB steps

With regards to 1. Bitcoin does not have a fee market, although I agree
that might be a good goal. There is no price-determination of fees and no
definition of quality of service. A fee market would entail some matching
of demand and supply to establish a price. Users would adjust fee to win a
transaction slow in a deterministic way. However currently the user has no
way of knowing what effect a fee might have. So this would necessarily
include some kind pricing-mechanism with actual commitments. Bitcoin as a
system is quite far away from such a capability. It would mean Bitcoin is
capable of adapting to how it is used. For example that would allow to
shift transactions from high demand period to low demand period. I'm not
aware of any proposal to make an actual functioning fee market in Bitcoin
(or even the conceptual primitives).
