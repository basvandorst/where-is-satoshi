I was just looking into the conventions around this yesterday! It seems
like this proposal is mostly just formalizing stuff that is already a tacit
standard. I'm glad to see that someone is documenting it somewhere more
It appears consistent with  However,
due to historical timing, the PR you linked doesn't include any standards

In the review thread you had mentioned that you needed an ACK from prusnak,
but he explicitly gave a NACK in favor of a separate proposal for BIP 48,
which seems like it could be something like the OP. Reading the proposal it
seems consistent with the pull request that you linked, as well. At the end
of the thread the author of PR said they would open a separate
proposal, but it appears that it never materialized. Was there a reason for

Hi Antoine,
Consensus capture by miners isn't the only concern here. Consensus capture
by any subset of users whose interests diverge from the overall consensus
is equally damaging. The scenario I can imagine here is that the more light
clients outpace full nodes, the more the costs of security are being
externalized from the light clients onto the full nodes. In this situation,
it can make full nodes harder to run. If they are harder to run it will
price out some marginal set of full node operators, which causes a net new
increase in light clients (as the disaffected full nodes convert), AND a
redistribution of load onto a smaller surface area. This is a naturally
unstable process. It is safe to say that as node counts drop, the set of
node operators will increasingly represent economic actors with extreme
weight. The more this process unfolds, the more likely their interests will
diverge from the population at large, and also the more likely they can be
coerced into behavior they otherwise wouldn't. After all it is easier to
find agents who carry lots of economic weight. This is true independent of
their mining status, we should be just as wary of consensus capture by
exchanges or HNWI's as we are about miners.

I think that one of the solutions here is to have light clients choose
their full node tethers explicitly. Even if you think it is unrealistic to
have everyone run their own node (fwiw, I don?t), there is still a trust
model where you can pick your trusted source.
This way you could have many light clients working off of a family node,
and the peer services could be limited to some sort of ?authenticated?
peers. Perhaps this is better accomplished over the RPC interface in Core,
but the idea is to have some sort of peer service model between ?full
public? and ?owner only?. This limits the amount of costs that can be
properly externalized, without exposing risk of consensus capture by
economically weighty institutions.

This is actually somewhat my point. If the RPC interface was good for this
and *didn't* introduce risks, we could just use that and be done with it.
But I'm finding there are many use cases that you want to have low cost
ways to serve peer services to people whom you have given explicit
permission, but they shouldn't have full ability to administrate the node.
Perhaps I wasn't explicit in my previous note but what I mean is that there
seems to be a demand for something *in between* a peer interface, and an
owner interface. I have little opinion as to whether this belongs in core
or not, I think there are much more experienced folks who can weight in on
that, but without something like this, you cannot limit your exposure for
serving something like bip157 filters without removing your own ability to
make use of some of those same services.

For what it's worth, this is a main research area for us at Start9 Labs.
not as seamless as it could, what blockers are there?
At the root of all of these problems is that a "private server" is
considered inconvenient. There is no fundamental reason this has to be the
case. The main UX challenges we've found are around installation and
configuration of server applications, not to mention, that users don't have
an existing mental model for how to imagine applications. Most people who
do not work on computers for a living have heard of servers but their
firsthand experience with software is "apps". The fact that there is a
component of their applications that runs remotely on computers they don't
So in short:
1. Educating on the distinction between client and server apps is an open
question whose burden will likely fall on the entire industry if we want to
get this right and not have an exchange takeover of Bitcoin.
2. Apps that either require "zero configuration" or have very easy in-app
walkthroughs of the bare essentials of configuration
3. GUI style installs of server applications familiar to those who have
installed desktop or mobile software.
I'm sure there are more things we'll learn as we grow but these are the top
three observations we've made and this is our primary area of work.
mentioned many times as a good solution against all sorts of problems in a
future full of LN + SPV nodes. I agree.
This is the main thesis I've been going on for a while. Once your full node
has synced the whole blockchain and the total set of headers is known, you
don't actually even need to carry 100% of the block data, as you can
re-fetch a needed block from elsewhere and verify the block data matches
the header you've already checked for consensus. From there the header
chain can serve as base truth for a whole set of L2+ services or L1 SPV
wallets. Ideally, in a model like this, more expensive peer services would
be authenticated so that your other applications could get the data they
need without exposing your full node to the extra costs of those who are
not running their own nodes. Typically we've used Core's RPC API for this
but as others have mentioned upthread JSON is a wasteful format and there
are good reasons that you'd want Lightning to be able to request peer
services without necessarily having ownership control over the node.
The other thing I wanted to note is the fact that the issue isn't that
Lightning does SPV, the issue is around whether or not the node it is
tethered to is *actually* trusted since SPV necessarily trusts some
dimensions of the information supplied to it. Doing SPV against a full node
you own is no more dangerous than indexing watch only addresses in Core and
then asking for wallet/utxo information over RPC.
