@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Extension block proposal by Jeffrey et al 
I'd appreciate the authors chiming in, but I read the PASDA differently:
1) If a transaction is mined with a certain bit set, it reserves 700 bytes
for that particular block.
2) In that space, 2 transactions may happen:
a) First, a transaction penalizing the "parent" transaction for fraud by
spending the funds immediately
b) Second, a "free rider" transaction that penalizes fraud within a ~2 week
This means during systematic flooding of closing transactions by
Goldfinger, vigilant watchers of their channels can immediately punish the
fraud in the same block using (a), and if they are unable to, need to find
space within two weeks in (b).
This is really in the LN weeds however, so I'll refrain from evaluating the
efficacy of such a solution.

To avoid "re-use" I suppose you'd want to sign some message like
`HMAC("ownership proof", H(A || x) )` instead. Otherwise any signature you
make using `A` ends up being used as a proof you don't know the input(this
seems like just details but to be more clear)...
To reiterate:
Sign `HMAC("ownership proof", H(A || x) )` using `A`. Public verifiers see
`HMAC("ownership proof", some_random_hash_connected_to_A )` and the HWW
that owns that input can recreate `some_random_hash_connected_to_A` by `H(A

You're mistaking concern for users potentially losing money with disdain

Interesting parallels to current Elements sidechain peg-in functionality.
User tweaks the watchmen(BTC holder) pubkey using P2CH, committing to a
script that is used on the *sidechain side* as spending authorization for
that bitcoin output rather than mainnet.
I think composing the two can be done as:
P = C' + H(C'||S')G + H(C||S)G
where C is redefined as `C' + H(C'||S')G`, which for Bitcoin consensus
purposes is just a single pubkey.

- unknown, because we have received only an address from the receiver
- or it is known, because it is ours and in that case it doesn?t make
sense to include it in PSBT
Signers are an extremely heterogeneous bunch. A signer may need to
introspect on the script, such as "this is a 2-of-3,
and I'm one of the keys". Even in basic p2pkh settings not adding any
output information rules out things like change
detection on any conceivable hardware wallet, or even simple software
wallets that don't carry significant state.
