Hi Devs,
Please consider the draft proposal below for peer review.
  BIP: ?
  Title: Block size doubles at each reward halving with max block size of
  Author: John Sacco   Status: Draft
  Type: Standards Track
  Created: 2015-11-11
Change max block size to 2MB at next block subsidy halving, and double the
block size at each subsidy halving until reaching 32MB.
This proposal belongs in the public domain. Anyone can use this text for
any purpose with proper attribution to the author.
1.    Gradually restores block size to the default 32 MB setting originally
implemented by Satoshi.
2.    Initial increase to 2MB at block halving in July 2016 would have
minimal impact to existing nodes running on most hardware and networks.
3.    Long term solution that does not make enthusiastic assumptions
regarding future bandwidth and storage availability estimates.
4.    Maximum block size of 32MB allows peak usage of ~100 tx/sec by year
5.    Exercise network upgrade procedure during subsidy reward halving, a
milestone event with the goal of increasing awareness among miners and node
1.    Increase the maximum block size to 2MB when block 630,000 is reached
and 75% of the last 1,000 blocks have signaled support.
2.    Increase maximum block size to 4MB at block 840,000.
3.    Increase maximum block size to 8MB at block 1,050,000.
4.    Increase maximum block size to 16MB at block 1,260,000.
5.    Increase maximum block size to 32MB at block 1,470,000.
Backward compatibility
All older clients are not compatible with this change. The first block
larger than 1M will create a network partition excluding not-upgraded
network nodes and miners.
While more comprehensive solutions are developed, an increase to the block
size is needed to continue network growth. A longer term solution is needed
to prevent complications associated with additional hard forks. It should
also increase at a gradual rate that retains and allows a large
distribution of full nodes.  Scheduling this hard fork to occur no earlier
than the subsidy halving in 2016 has the goal of simplifying the
communication outreach needed to achieve consensus, while also providing a
buffer of time to make necessary preparations.

I like your suggestion for the continuity and it gets us up to 2 MB in the
shorter term. Also I just noticed the math error.
Here is a revised spec (incorporating suggestions from Chun Wang):
* 1 MB, height < 210,000;
* 2 MB, height 210,000 < 420,000; (when 75% of last 1,000 blocks signal
* 4 MB, height 420,000 < 630,000; (year 2016)
* 8 MB, height 630,000 < 840,000; (year ~2020)
* 16 MB, height 840,000 < 1,050,000; (year ~2024)
* 32 MB, height >= 1,050,000. (year ~2028)

Revised spec below to put us back at 2 MB at next halving in 2016
(addressing Luke & Drak's points). This is more in line with intent of the
original proposal and provides sufficient time to gain consensus.
blocks signal support and block 420,000 reached, ~July 2016)
* 4 MB, height 630,000 < 840,000; (year ~2020)
* 8 MB, height 840,000 < 1,050,000; (year ~2024)
* 16 MB, height 1,050,000 < 1,260,000; (year ~2028)
* 32 MB, height >= 1,260,000. (year ~2032)
