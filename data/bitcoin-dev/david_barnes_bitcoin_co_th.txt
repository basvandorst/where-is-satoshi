Please take a look at my BIP0074 draft proposal (this is my first one so
may be incorrectly formatted)
This proposal will make it possible for a simpler form of Bitcoin
payment at physical shop locations.
Currently when making a Bitcoin payment at a shop the merchant needs to
have an app of some kind so that they can calculate the amount of
bitcoins you need to pay them to cover your purchase (of for example:
The problem is that many employees are not properly trained on the
Bitcoin app, or the owner is the one with the app and he is often not
there.  When visiting "Bitcoin Accepting" estabishments you will often
run into this problem.  The businesses often don't get enough Bitcoin
business to warrant training sessions or dedicate hardware to run the app.
A simpler way to accept payments would be for the merchant to have a
fixed QR code, and no app at all.  However a printed QR code can't
calculate any exchange rates, and so it would be up to the customer to
choose how much to pay.
This can be result in some problems as the customer may be using their
default wallet exchange rates, or their preferred international
exchange. While the merchant may be actually using a local exchange or
service to exchange the coins to local currency, and there may be some
discrepancy between what the customer thinks the rate should be and what
the merchant thinks the rate should be.
Enter BIP0074, so that the merchant can specify which exchange rates
they are using, and the customer and then look up the rates from this
source and pay according to these rates.

There are a number of services that offer Bitcoin payment notification
via SMS.
If the cashier only has a dumb-phone (or smart phone without Bitcoin
app) they can receive notification of the payment...all without any need
for an app or internet access.
I envision that their dynamic rate provider will also be offer the SMS
notification service; but independent services are also available.

I picked up the next available number myself, but can be changed to anything, the 74 is unimportant to the proposal.

Let me answer your questions below; but let me give you a little preface
about how I envision the full cycle working.
My company has setup a service here:  The service will work as follows:
- Merchants print out a QR code with address (and hopefully a DRL URL too)
- When customers wish to pay Bitcoin they scan the QR code pay the
amount the merchant tells them (such as "This kebab is 235 Thai Baht")
- Merchant / Staff instantly receive an SMS that payment is received
But currently the customers wallet does not have DRL, so will not give
the exact same exchange rate that we are giving the merchant, so that
the amount the merchant receives will not be the exact 235 Thai Baht
that they requested, but maybe 225, or 242.24 etc...as the customers is
currently picking any exchange basically out of thin air.
With this BIP it would allow the customer's wallet to know the exact
rate that merchant is receiving, therefore when the merchant requests
"235 Thai Baht" they actually receive exactly 235 Thai Baht.
But why do this?  Apps work fine; smart phones are fine, merchants are
currently fine.
In my experience (running a merchant service, and exchange in Thailand
for 2 years and hosting 80+ Bitcoin meetup events) currently merchants
are not fine.  Almost everyone I meet at the meetups has been traveling
around looking for places to pay Bitcoin, only to find that when the ask
for the bill "the own (aka the only guy in the place interested in
Bitcoin) is not here".
Pushing the angle of trying to get the merchants to properly train their
staff, or have a dedicated Bitcoin accepting phone/tablet is making
almost no progress, so we can trying to tackle the problem from a
different angle and come up with something that requires no training,
and no owner (Bitcoin interested guy) to be there.
But for it to work really seamlessly the merchant and customer need to
be on the same page with regards to the exchange rating being used.
And now to answer your questions:
This BIP assumes that the staff do not have any app.  They are just
ringing up the customer in their standard POS and telling the customer
the fiat amount they must pay.
Also assumes that the merchant is going to be moving the coins to a
service or exchange to convert so need to use the rates from that
In the service we are running there will be an SMS notification sent to
the staff.  There are also a number of services that provide SMS
notification upon Bitcoin transactions to a specific address.
But also in some cases they may just be willing to trust the customer;
especially for small food items, or repeat customers etc...
Yes the DRP may provide historical rates.  Or in the case of our service
an order is created in our system and rate is saved at the moment the
unconfirmed Bitcoin transaction is received.
But this is outside the scope of this BIP, which is simply to lookup the
current spot rate the DRP is offering.
With our service the merchant will receive an SMS that payment is been
completed, and the amount of the payment (in the fiat currency)
But this is outside the scope of the actual BIP as the merchant is free
to use whatever method they want to get notified of a payment.
This is somewhat outside of the scope of the BIP, but within our service
it would be quite easy for them to match up orders in our system with
receipts from their POS seeing as an order is received in our system at
the first moment the unconfirmed transaction appears.  And with DRL it
should match the exact fiat amount they requested.
I'm unclear why a payment would go missing, unless you are referring to
double spends, or Bitcoin transactions sent with insufficient fees?  In
this case our service would provide a warning that the transaction was
unlikely to confirm.
In the case of our service the rate is locked at the moment of the
unconfirmed transaction, so not an issue.
It's not so much an issue with not having internet, it's more the issue
of not being properly trained on how to use the apps/internet.  And even
with training the staff are easily going to forget if they don't see a
Bitcoin customer for several weeks at a time.
This is based on a lot of first hand experience and feedback from
Bitcoin customers and merchants...based on other stories I hear from
people trying to pay with Bitcoin at physical locations I don't think
this issue is isolated to Thailand only.
