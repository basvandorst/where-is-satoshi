@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Instant exchange rates URI scheme 
Hello,
I'd like to propose a BIP for a standard URI scheme to allow wallet
operators that implement instant exchange or pegging to other currencies,
cryptocurrencies or asset classes to allow for interoperable communications
of rates and other pertinent information.
The idea is to include in the wallet address as parameters information that
supplements the presentation of a proposed transaction.
For example, a wallet operator that instantly exchanges bitcoin to gold
would present a wallet address as follows:
 :  the currency, cryptocurrency or asset that the transaction
will end up as encoded in ISO 4217 if applicable.
 : the bitcoin to  rate as dictated by receiving wallet
 : unix timestamp of when the rate loses validity
This would allow the sending wallet the ability to present up-to-date
exchange rates. When, for example, a wallet operator that pegs to the USD
scans the address above, it would be able to present to the user the
following information:
1. USD to XAU rate
2. How much XAU will be received by the address
3. How long before the rates expires

Wouldn't need to. The  is of BTC to . BTC is the intermediary currency, as is basically how it becomes in this "payment rails" method.
To the receiver, it wouldn't matter what currency the transaction came from.

This scheme would mostly be beneficial to end users of instant exchange wallets and would be implemented by the operators. None of the parameters would be filled up by the user by hand. It's more of enabling different wallet operators to communicate with each other and to be able to present to their end users the rates they are getting when sending from their pegged wallet to another pegged wallet. Abstracting bitcoin rates from both end users.?
To illustrate, imagine Alice who has a USD wallet wants to send JPY 10,000 to Bob who has a JPY pegged wallet.?
Alice's wallet scans Bob's wallet which tells Alice's wallet the following info:
1. Bob's BTC address
2. Bob's wallet currency is JPY
3. Bob's wallet operator is pricing BTC 1 at JPY?27,779 for the next 5 minutes.?
With these info, Alice's wallet can already derive the following:
Alice needs to send?0.35998416 BTC to send JPY 10,000. Alice's wallet can also show how much?0.35998416 BTC is in USD, which is USD 83.27. Alice's wallet can present it as follows;
"You are sending JPY 10,000 for USD 83.27 to Bob's wallet."
