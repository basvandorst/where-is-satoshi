If this proposal has less than half of the total hashpower (or is it even
less than 75%? Haven't quite thought it through completely) supporting it,
I can see the following happening if the sum of supporters and people who
want to screw the supporters out of money is at least 75%:
Non-supporters create blocks with the new version, but don't actually
implement the rule. Then after the new rule is locked in, miners will
create too-large blocks that are rejected by the majority. If the
percentage is less than half, then from their perspective, they will
essentially be on the losing  side of a soft fork, and they'll be losing
money by mining for nothing, even from their perspective and that of e.g.
users and merchants who have upgraded.

My interpretation is that he's saying Satoshi wouldn't be welcome to return
as Satoshi, because whatever he did/said would inevitably end up being
treated with authority, which shouldn't be the case.

A smaller block size would make this a soft fork, as unupgraded nodes would
consider the new blocks valid. It would only make things that were allowed
forbidden, which is the definition of a soft fork. For a hard fork, you
need to allow something that was previously invalid.

A child is a transaction that spends outputs of another transaction, the
parent. The child cannot be confirmed before the parent, because the
outputs being spent do not yet exist.
A transaction that is not completely signed won't be relayed, correct, and
it cannot be mined.

Right. The issue (AIUI) is that, right now, even though transactions are
evaluated for inclusion as a group with CPFP, they're not yet evaluated for
relaying as a unit, nor can they be, because the current p2p protocol
doesn't have a way to send multiple transactions in a single protocol
message to signify that they should be evaluated together.

RTFM: `help lockunspent`. The boolean parameter is whether or not the UTXO
should be available.

Maybe I'm missing something, but wouldn't this turn into a hard fork the
moment you try to spend an output created in one of these extension blocks?
So sure, the block that contains the extension would be considered valid,
but unupgraded validators will not update the UTXO set accordingly, meaning
that those new TXOs can't be spent because, according to their rules, they
don't exist.
