Funny that you should describe WoT that way. According to some
psycho-analysts the act of making love to a partner is actually a
realization of our subconscious desire to make love to ourselves.
So, in this sense, WoT geeks are indeed masturbating, but it's with
the good purpose of ensuring that it's being done via the intended
recipient and not some imposter or unsuspecting bystander.
That's a valid concern, especially as Bitcoin development ranks grow
and branch beyond a small core team.

It is not scientific or sensible to go from proposal stage straight to
voting and then implementation stage.
The proposals you have diligently gathered, summarized and presented
in your document must go through testing, and scenario simulation with
published results, in order for objective evaluation to be made possible.
For that matter, even "running up against a capacity limit" has not
been simulated or tested. Additionally, (and looking the other way)
there is a lack of provision for scaling DOWN in the current proposals
- - hard to envision, yes - but what goes up will eventually come down.
A global credit contraction is not unlikely, nor is natural disaster,
and these scenarios have implications for usage, scale, degree of
decentralization and security.

rigorous Computer Science to Bitcoin.

Hector, if you could provide data that convinces why 8MB is better
than 6.18MB or 1MB then we'd get out of the realm of opinion and
pointless rhetoric that threatens to keep this debate in a quagmire.
We'd have actual figures to work with and projections to go by.
But fetching "majority" agreement (where from?) does not cut it for
setting Bitcoin on a future path. If we go by that then we'd soon be
giving coinbase rewards to users for being "loyal supporters" because,
as a majority, they think that's what they'd like to see.
If a proposal is demonstrably, and provably, a good idea - and a
developer consensus agrees - then it should go to testing, and
eventually, code. Other than that it's just conjecture and words
without a research paper and data.
In the final analysis, do we want Bitcoin to be steered by an
uninformed and fickle majority, or do we want to use this list as a
forum to present research proposals containing repeatable, verifiable
facts? A progressive process of convincing those most familiar with
Bitcoin's code and operation so they may implement Good Ideas during
the next century and after is surely preferable to Vote-my-code-Coin. :)

Jorge will answer for himself, but you know that saying "9MB is also
safe if 8MB is" blows your position.
Do you, or me, or XT know that 8MB is "safe"? You say 9MB must then
also be "safe" - there has been no fact for me to grasp and from which
to tell a Bitcoin trading whale group: "here's the bottom line: this
is what it means and these are the implications." They hold
significant amounts of bitcoin and want to see a plan, and a strategy
based on facts. I can assure you, they're not going to XT, it lacks
both a strategy and the seasoned developers present here.
You're articulate and you raise valid issues, but your judgment of
"safer" is not based on anything you or this list can refer to as a
It seems you want 8MB for some ideological reason but if you examine
your motive and compare it to the facts, you'll find that many people
in this list are ultimately correct in saying that:
Whatever blocksize is set to, demand will soon fill it.
This is the nature of resource supply inflation - some business plan
will spot the opportunity and exploit it, colonize it and then we deal
with that, with some big-girls'-blouses exclaiming: "if we don't give
them what they want they're all going to leave to XT or ZT!"
Even though XT and ZT perfectly fulfill the needs of certain ambitious
businesses, the creators would rather see it happen on Core's
blockchain. Else why do they still come posit arguments here?
Fortunately, unlike the principle that applies in finance capital,
Bitcoin capacity supply doesn't have be increased on demand (not
without rigorous testing and evaluation) plus there is no maxim here
that "the customer is always right". The maxim is "be your own bank" -
during some periods it might be a slow bank but it _will_ remain
decentralized and it _will_ remain your own - not compromised to some
big business or mining cartel.
We want to compromise to science and reason, not profit motive or
democratic lobbying, right?

It's a big problem. What are you dismissing it for?
With Bitcoin in fledgling 0.x version state this is neither desirable

Development did not freeze at some time in the past and now we see how
the userbase reacts. Miners, btw, are arguibly still a class of user
as long as they are guaranteed coinbase.
When they start making and proving themselves useful in a free
floating fee market absent coinbase subsidy, we can revisit this

Hash: SHA1
I think the context is not that "Bitcoin's reason for existence is to
avoid trusting anyone but yourself", as you state above. This kind of
dystopia is not, in my view, what the advocates of trustlessness and
security are implying.
There are those instances where we have no option other than to trust
a centralized authority. They are mostly self-appointed and do not
have the interests of the rest of us in mind. The central bank is the
obvious example - they impose their currency as "official" and then
devalue our savings and purchasing power through money supply
inflation - without our permission and in betrayal of the trust
relationship.  Bitcoin allows one to hold money and to conduct money
transactions, transmit value, and so forth without having to trust
*them* - the central bank, or anyone.
In another example, we want to conduct escrow and have to trust the
notary, because of his reputation and framed certificate, but Bitcoin
multisig makes the degree of trust between the escrow parties
irrelevant, so no apparently trustworthy "gentleman" merchant (back
then or now) can socially engineer a transaction and scam us.
I don't know if my reply and its examples is over-simplistic but it
seems you were making a moral appeal that the notion of trustlessness
was destructive - I just wanted to contextualize it to relevant use
cases. It follows, and this is what I understand from Adam's message,
that security and protection of decentralization are paramount
concerns if we want to retain the trustlessness that makes Bitcoin so
useful and powerful.

Hash: SHA1
I read through your message and see the point you're trying to make,
but would like to point out that it is not useful to talk about
hypothetical scenarios involving Bitcoin that include the supposition
"ignoring centralization effects".
Decentralization concerns are fundamental to this innovation, else it
loses its meaning and value. And that's the trade-off that Pieter,
Jorge, Martin, Adam and others have referring to during the past 24
hours: in order to have a secure Bitcoin that is not vulnerable to
centralization, certain sacrifices have to be made and the Consensus
Rule of a relatively small blocksize is the main protection we
currently have.
There are a lot of "larger blocks, more transactions" arguments being
made that overlook this core axiom of decentralization. That is why
the developers and thinkers with the deepest understanding of this
protocol are pointing out the need for another layer on top of
Bitcoin. That is where the scaling can take place to cater for the
use-cases of more txns, quicker txns, remittance, etc. and with it
increased adoption.

@_author: Venzen Khaosan 
@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Fees and the block-finding process 
Hash: SHA1
Your concern for adoption is valid yet there are a few assumptions in
your discussion and they are a common thread in the current wave of
"bigger blocksize" topics.
1) Supplying bigger blocks will meet the demand of more people:
Anyone can transact via Bitcoin. By increasing blocksize and making
more transactions possible at low fees, what's to stop a large
corporation, bank or government from using the protocol as a cheap
settlement mechanism. They don't have to fund or develop their own
(well, Ecuador has, for this exact use-case) and perhaps the utility
and capacity of the Bitcoin network means reliability and low fees
(cheaper than a bank clearance, say) for their use-case. In the
process they hog xMB of space in each block and discussion about a
capacity limit continues in this list. Increased supply *will* be
utilized - by all kinds of entities - not only the girl next-door and
the unbanked proletariat.
2) Dissatisfied users will move to alt-coins so Bitcoin better be
The assumption here is that the best skills and most able minds are
fairly evenly distributed amongst alt-coin dev teams. I doubt this is
true and the notion underestimates the quality of developer that is
attracted to Bitcoin Core to apply themselves to this project, often
self-funded. There are few (if any) comparable cryptocurrencies or cc
dev teams out there. Hence the Bitcoin market cap, the large
stakeholder industry, and the established brand.
3) Bitcoin is better money.
Yes, indeed. It's genius and revolution. Yet, it does not fit every
use-case. I know people don't like it when I make this example, but
it's the truth where I live, and by extension, in many places in the
I live in rural Southeast Asia. Some houses have electricity and some
don't: by choice, because rural lifestyle in the tropics does not
always require you to have electricity. People charge their mobile
phones at the community eating house every other day. The electricity
supply is unreliable. I've had to rig a solar charging system to a
UPS, but most people around here have no choice but to deal with
intermittent power cuts. The local market has a diesel generator, so
constant electricity, but if a power cut lasts for long enough the
local cellular mast battery backup depletes and then there is no
cellular connectivity - the only means of accessing the internet.
Now, how does one expect this community to use or adopt
cryptocurrency? They are mostly unbanked, get paid fiat wages at the
end of the week and spend fiat on commodities, rent, food and
entertainment like the rest of the world. But Bitcoin is not a "better
money" in their case, and who knows for how long this condition will
remain true.
4) TBD
The notion that there be dragons at the capacity limit is unfounded
and reactionary. We have to make the journey and find out what is, in
fact, there at the edge - as many others have argued in the list. This
is our opportunity to make scientific observation and discovery for
the benefit of Bitcoin - while it is still in its early years and the
capacity limit untested.
Who knows? The outcome may be an informed decision to implement bigger
blocks. Informed. Based not on fear and uncertainty but on empirical
observation and facts.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] A summary list of all concerns related to not 
Hash: SHA1
Jorge, you say 3 concerns at the end of your message but I only see 1)
and 2). Assuming you've got a 3) and will add it, I'll contribute:
4) General, undefined fear that something bad is going to happen when
nodes choke up on a backlog of transactions.
- - no specific symptoms are pointed at but presumably there is
"pre-traumatic stress" at play.
- - Bitcoin-based businesses are going to lose money, customers and
potentially fail
- - people will flee Bitcoin for another cryptocoin and Bitcoin will be
left in the corner, collecting dust and memories of it will fade as
SuperCoin with its big blocks becomes all things to all people.
5) Specific belief that the exchange rate will decline on network
- - traders and investors will bid the price down, or
- - traders/investors will stop speculating all together because even if
their speculation is successful, they're not sure they'll be able to
get their bitcoin out of exchanges, what with the broken network and all.
- - The exchange rate reflects Bitcoin's value and not just speculation
guided by a few large players like in other markets.
6) Belief that Bitcoin's "cargo" is about to be delivered by fate:
- - see - - the cargo is variably presumed to be a range of hoped-for events: an
adoption surge, a speculative rally similar to (or bigger than) 2013,
or a global financial crisis that sees Bitcoin become the safe haven
of choice.
- - for the cargo to be delivered, a "runway" must be built - the larger
the runway, the larger the cargo delivery. If the current runway is
not expanded, then the cargo plane will go to a different island and
won't come to Bitcoin Island.
- - it is short-sighted and, in a way, ungrateful of the "generals" not
to expand the runway - it will be their fault that the cargo doesn't
get delivered and all the island's people, no the whole ocean's
islands, will suffer because of silly security concerns.
- - some people have taken the blueprints of the airbase and are
building a large airstrip elsewhere on Bitcoin Island, but nobody is
helping them build that long and wide runway. Everybody wants to
expand this moderate runway - even the renegades who started Big
Blocks Great Success airstrip.
- - The sacred site of No-Middle-Zero-Attack-Point is at the start of
the current runway. To expand it the site must be destroyed, but some
former generals and many people say: It doesn't matter, we want Cargo,
not a small attack surface. Just blast it!

In the scenario below, you argue that the current 1MB limit would lead

then a government or banking group may choose to utilize 1.5GB of the

network. Then how did upping the blocksize remedy anything? Or is this
use-case not plausible?

As an alternative to the preferred BIP100 this proposal is good
because it establishes a plan of action for dealing with the recent
ramp-up (100% increase) in number of transactions and transaction
size. Arguably, a transitory spam attack, yes, but with a speculative
rally brewing (and implied increases in network usage) this BIP may
prove to be just-in-time.
Solutions favoring dynamic vs. scheduled increases in blocksize (and
by how much) are interesting and the proponents should explore and map
out their proposal with data sets, trend projections and future
scenarios. It will require labor and time, but convince the list about
the scientific merit of your proposal.
In the meantime, the current "sufficient" state of network capacity
may soon experience "insufficient" moments. Developer confluence
around a workable plan and testing should, reasonably, begin now.
Jeff's proposal addresses an approaching capacity crunch whilst
honoring decentralization and providing time for testing and
alternative future innovations. It's the best solution the user base
and developers currently have for all the reasons Jeff gives:
conservative blocksize increase, added capacity, low impact and
minimal implication for the network and its users.
Then, many of the more far-reaching proposals being offered can be
tested, formalized, and fleshed out with scenario data.

Raystonn, I'm aware that you're addressing your question to Greg
Maxwell, however a point you keep stating as fact calls for reference:
Cheapest way to send value? Is this what Bitcoin is trying to do? So
all of the smart contract, programmable money, consensus coding and
tremendous developer effort is bent to the consumer demand for cheaper
fees. Surely thou jests!
Modern economic study? Can you please provide a link or reference to
the study you are referring to.
"liquidity moves to the location of least friction"
This sounds like "econo-speak" and makes no sense. The definition of
Liquidity is the degree to which an asset/security can be bought or
sold in the market without affecting the price.
That is why bitcoin is said to have low liquidity: buying or selling
only 100 BTC visibly affects the exchange price. You probably mean
"people like cheap fees", which is true, but as others have said,
because of Bitcoin's powerful features, they are willing to pay higher
fees and wait longer for transactions to execute.
As for your public cross-examination of Greg Maxwell, your case seems
to  be made on the assumption that limiting the size of the blockchain
is an attempt to artificially raise tx fees, but it is not the case
(as you and others repeatedly argue) that reluctance to concede
blocksize is an attempt to constrain capacity. Greg Maxwell thoroughly
explained in this thread that the protocol's current state of
development relies on  blocksize for security and, ultimately, as a
means of protecting its degree of decentralization.
Surely, this is an obvious concern even for those who are campaigning
for the hare-brained ideal of making Bitcoin a "faster, cheaper
alternative" to visa or paypal? If we lose decentralization, we lose
the whole thing, right? Incorrect or correct?

You know, it is always insightful to get the perspective of active
participants and Core developers like yourself. As Adam pointed out
earlier, the developers have done mileage in this space and have
already considered most of the conceptual issues and technical
challenges that must resurface in waves as new interested parties join
the list. Allow me, in this response to your message, to make a
proposal to those who may be interested:
Bitcoin's protocol functions and the implications of this innovation
for the future are difficult to grasp, even for the smartest among us.
Then there are also the words of Niels Bohr:
"Prediction is difficult, especially about the future."
They say a lot of time and energy is wasted because we don't know what
we don't know. Years of discussion among those in the list has
established certain axioms that determine the options for Bitcoin
going forward. According to my comprehension, the following are some
of the most relevant for the present discussion (please correct me
where I'm off the mark):
1. A high degree of decentralization is prima optima.
2.  Bitcoin is much more than a payment network. A lot of the
non-payment features are, arguably, what gives Bitcoin most of its
value. Yet, the payment functionality is a major design feature and
all agree that it should scale - subject to axiom 1.
3. The Bitcoin payment network ("Layer 1"), due to technical
constraints imposed by its p2p design, cannot compete with Visa and
other centralized transmission channels for speed or transaction
volume. Nor can it handle the transaction requirements of the world's
population - the scaling required would necessarily render Bitcoin
centralized, insecure and, therefore, worthless.
4. The addition of "layer 2" protocols (such as Lightning and other
sidechains) will allow fast, low-fee (and with virtually instant
confirmation) bitcoin transactions within two years, according to the
developers active in that:
5. This "layering of protocols" simplifies the scaling (blocksize)
debate because it separates
 A) the primary concern for security and fidelity via
decentralization, and
 B) the ideal of universal accessibility via fast, low-fee transactions.
Discussion about scalability can therefore proceed with the knowledge
that Lightning and other "layer 2" sidechains will make Bitcoin
accessible to the global majority - and be fast like Bruce Lee - while
the Bitcoin developers can focus on making Bitcoin Core protocol
(layer 1) the world heavyweight champion - Muhammad Ali.
Since I've maintained your interest up to the final sentence, I say:
as an insurance against a capacity crisis before layer 2 is deployed,
why not implement bip100's 2MB blocksize proposals in a testnet?

Mike Hearn, I might be a nobody to you, but you know i talk with
skill,  so let me tell this Friday...
You would, of course.
References are imperative if you want to appeal to intelligence in
this list. Studies. Impirical evidence. The above sounds like a a
mainstream precis of how money works - an over-simplistic precis. It's
more complex than that. Besides, all we know for a fact is that
currencies come and go. That's not me being down on Bitcoin - that is
the historical record.
Conjecture. And assumption. Banks might not accept most people
forever. Or banks' credibility might not survive the next credit
contraction, for example.
Half the story. Casual observation shows that growth and contraction
alternate at every level of existence. Just because the present
fiat-era credit expansion has lasted 40 years does not mean that the
economy will keep expanding forever.
yes, anyway, Greg Maxwell was justified in bringing you down a few
notches from your "I am Satoshi's rep on earth" history revision, you
were spinning there.
The assumption (my emphasis). You've seen that movie Pulp Fiction:
"Assume makes an "ass" of "U" and "me". Business + assumption =
gambling and potential loss of funds.
The ass-U-me cannot be laid at the doorstep of those developers who
prioritize security, decentralization and conservative, tested
progress of scaling.
Their SWOT analysis includes risks from the banking sector, too. Plus
competition from other exchanges. A sapling 0.x Bitcoin community is
not responsible for nannying anyone's lucrative business model at the
expense of security. How would that make the developers look in
relation to their duty of custody of the protocol? To this and future
generations: Not Good.
Nonsense, and again that assumption about "how things work" you like
to high horse so. Bitcoin's political survival is guaranteed by its
censorship resistance and its array of innovative and unique utility
functions. What's more, the caliber of developer working on Bitcoin is
not just pulled out of a hat and harnessed for an arbitrary altcoin.
Sometimes the fire of moral incentive overrides monetary reward.
The Fed, Nasdaq, IBM, and every other company whose trusted authority
is being threatened by this flagship are developing blockchains in a
hurry. How is that "many people out there who would like to see
digital cash disappear"? Why would you even type such a blatant falsehood?
That is a low estimation of Bitcoin. Your framing does not honor
Bitcoin or the hard work - your _own_ hard work - on this project.
If you noticed, there has been an increase in technical discussion in
this list in recent days - with the goal of comparing and testing the
various blocksize proposals.

Mike Hearn,
In the light of your responses to Adam Back's questions, below, I feel
it is time to speak up because what I now understand, and is implied,
is that Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen have planned and deployed the
infrastructure for a Bitcoin hard-fork and intend to action it despite
majority opposition.  I'll try to keep it brief:
Mike Hearn, you should cease your activity of a unilateral hard-fork
immediately. You are doing untold damage by breaking FOSS governance
protocol requiring methodical collaborative work and due process of
change implementation by consensus. Your actions are bad for the
Bitcoin project and its ideals, disrespectful of your peers and years
of their passionate hard work, and dangerous for Bitcoin in the
marketplace and bitcoin in peoples' wallets.
Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen do not own Bitcoin and, emphatically,
you cannot have it. Your hard-fork is tantamount to theft and you and
your collaborators will effectively ex-communicate yourselves from
this project and community. It appears that you are consciously trying
to usurp ownership and maintenance of Bitcoin. As if it is that easy!
You clearly do not comprehend the array of risks - especially the
unanticipated ones. As the market saying goes: "If you think
speculation is easy, it is because you are ignorant about the risks".
If you take the risks with Mike&GavCoin, that would be fine, but you
are about to take them with community-owned Bitcoin and Other People's
You are causing a lot of stress, unnecessarily, and grave concern
surrounds your proposed renegade action. You can dissolve the threat:
those players to whom you have made promises can be appeased and
eventually get most of what they need from this FOSS project. The
developers whom you are railroading to get your way, and the way in
which you are doing it, is about to cause a schism that will expand
outward from this community.
You may accuse the community for being antagonistic to you, and
therefore uncooperative, but it is plain to see that your bullheaded
manner eventually generates antagonism wherever you go. Taking Bitcoin
away from this community, in anger, won't solve the problem and will
be like killing the goose that lays the golden eggs.
If an individual in an objectively agreed-to FOSS-modelled
collaborative project has the audacity to threaten his peers and the
world with a unilateral hard-fork despite majority objection and a
probability distribution that includes terminal risks and unintended
consequences, then what would an impartial outsider think? Some of
their thoughts would include that the antagonist could be acting in
self-interest, or may be a paid actor, or worse, a saboteur. What
would they advise? Stop that individual, at once!
Bitcoin is a Free and Open Source Software project that serves as
flagship for the blockchain. It has a payment network but the key

Sure. Your thinking is sound. I take things beyond where you have in
your post, so I neither imply that this is your position or that this
is the progression of your stated point.
In one sense, one has to ask the question: is there a reasonable case
for making Bitcoin super-capacitated so it can compete with Visa and
just be the fastest-ever payment network with everyone jizzing in
their pants over its speed and capacity and availability and dividends.
By virtue of the core requirement of decentralization, for Bitcoin to
remain meaningful, it will never compete with Visa or the Fed's new
blockchain-based payment system. So, why attempt the impossible and
expend energy on the futile?
Bitcoin's protocol and payment network has features and benefits that
Visa et all cannot have, so I refute the notion, sometimes expressed
here, that 7tps is a major cap on growth and adoption.
Such thinking takes as its axiom the idea that increased adoption
correlates to increased value. Not true. Look at the price chart for
proof: More businesses accept and more people are using and
transacting via Bitcoin now than ever before and yet the price chart
points *down*, not up.
Why should any explicitly centralized exchange and business venture
have their use of the protocol facilitated? Was the protocol designed
to conform to financial capital demands or was it designed to
fundamentally change the way ordinary users interact with markets?
If those present here, do not realize that the blockchain is a means
of escaping (and destroying through its use and promotion)
centralization, then they have shells over their eyes. Bitcoin is not
meant to fit into the system, it will evolve the system, by the system
coming to it.
Does that mean we shouldn't raise the blocksize? Maybe. But 8GB with
BIP100's protections seems a reasonable change given the sudden
increase in network usage that a global liquidity crisis will impose.
Many scenarios are possible, but there is no onus on developers or on
Bitcoin to "keep up". Like it or not, the global economy will
inevitably be forced to Slow Down as a result of the same thinking
that upholds constant growth without sympathetic contraction.

Apologies in advance for pulling you up on your statement, Tom, I've
noticed you're a regular and well respected poster in this list:
"free market" who?
Are you aware that the Bitcoin rally of 2013 was a result of
speculation by elements in Citi Bank, JPMorgan, and by many other Wall
Street trading desk managers who saw the opportunity of a
free-floating, unregulated commodity?
If the intention is to leave Bitcoin to the "free market" it already
is, and has been there for some time.
As for miners, those are finance capitalist interest too - if not
currently, in their majority, then eventually in China and the rest of
the world, so what does the term "free market" really mean? It must be
defined, because you are speaking to developers here, not visionary
economists or politicized brains, necessarily.
We cannot speak about "the market" without referencing concerns about
centralization, because any centralized business that plays the game
right seeks, by the rules, to corner the market. If they cannot do it
alone, they will seek allies.
"Free market" means as much under capitalism as "open democracy" under
Stalinism. Do you see my point? "Free Market" is a multivariate term
and Bitcoin does not (and should not have to) cater to all its
demands. That's like applying Microsoft standards to FOSS efforts -
becuase that's the "business use-case".
Bitcoin developers have to think about economy in an informed manner
and make provision with protection, else one can just make like Mike
Hearn and jump up and down shouting "faster-faster more-more".
Economics, markets and speculation is more complicated than that.

Yes, Eric, blockchains are a means of mathematically determining
consensus among those who use them. The application goes beyond value
token into the realm of vote and deterministic politics. Eventually,
blockchains will allows citizens to choose state projects and to
contribute taxes according to their ability, and to benefit according
to their need.
Economic Participants
The dichotomy of the mining operator as an economic class on one hand
and the user as a dependent on the other is based on the current
Keynesian model of economics that views the centralized as inevitable
and the citizen as a consumer to be enlisted into spending at every
Schools of Thought
Although not a definitive answer, the Austrian School of Economics
illustrates that the Keynesian model (which we all harbor to some
degree, thanks to its global hegemony) is fundamentally flawed:
 (Of all the resources
available, this speaker is most succinct, although I cannot vouch for
his degree of Frankfurt School compliance or potential Zionist
leanings - the account conforms to academic agreement of what the
Austrian School of Economics stands for).
Developers are, by necessity, making economic decisions
If the developers will seize this moment of having to make economic
decisions about how Bitcoin will be influenced and grow according to
market dynamics, they should make an informed decision (only the
developers can make the decision at this time), they should strive to
make a well-informed decision - not some fumbled
"hurry-the-blocksize-is-running-out" decision. Pieter Wuille argues
the point convincingly in his initial post.
The fundamental question to be answered here is: Do developers want to
compete with existing payment networks, or do developers want to
define Bitcoin's network in its own right?
If Bitcoin must compete and win, then centralize it and it will soon
beat the competition on every metric.
If Bitcoin is its own beast, then users and finance capital must adapt
to its constraints, for the benefit of all involved.
Developers have a crucial role to play in implementing economic
policy. It's not self-evident: a multinational or government sponsored
entity mining this blockchain with the purpose of dominating it does
not mean you have done your job of surrendering Bitcoin to the "free
The decision rests on your informed understanding of economics (and
myths about economics) and choosing the way that liberates Bitcoin and
its users, and does not co-opt them into a system that seeks to devour
competition. Talk about making Bitcoin more compliant to finance
capital business is counter-Bitcoin and speakers harboring this
opinion have come to dominate discussion here. If increased business
and user adoption truly increased value, you would see it in the price
chart. What has ignorant, fashion-prone mainstreet adoption done for
Bitcoin? Will it really do something else, as some posters claim, or
will it do more of the same?

Advocations of "formalizing the process" may have a good outcome, but
that is not the issue in the current dilemma. The present process is
good enough. And that's as much as we can hope for.
The issue is: does Bitcoin need to scale to business or does business
need to scale to Bitcoin.
Business is not the Holy Spirit that fills Bitcoin with utility.
Bitcoin already has utility and finance capital would like to ride
that utility for its own profit motive. Some posters, here in this
list, would like to accelerate that process and they justify their
argument with the assumption that greater adoption equals greater
utility and value (and price).
That is a false assumption. Given the increased adoption of Bitcoin by
users and businesses during the past year, does the price chart
reflect greater value or price? Of course not, the price chart is at
terminal lows. Fact not fiction.
It is a fiction of common "market wisdom" that greater adoption
increases a commodity's value. Speculation plays with commodity value
even when underlying fundamental value remains unchanged. China has
verifiably been purchasing record amounts of Gold, but there is no
effect in the price chart (or on Gold's objective value).
Bitcoin's price chart will go up and down many times in the coming
years as speculators play their game. It's independent of the
underlying censorship resistance, mathematical consensus and
transaction security of Bitcoin. Once the decentralization is
sacrificed to big business then you can expect the final price chart low.
Until then, let's hold our horses and maintain an even keel: Bitcoin
is not trying to fit into the manic global economy's race toward the
edge of a precipice - Bitcoin is the solution once its all gone wrong
- - for ordinary users, not opportunistic bank-based business models
such as JPMorgan, Pantera Capital or BTC-China.
If you cannot see the inherent centralization problem with most
so-called Bitcoin businesses you just haven't done your homework.

Aaron, I am most definitely taking speculative cycles into account - I
write Bitcoin market analysis reports on a daily basis.
Since discussion is exploring notions of "value" and assumptions about
"what increases value" I will post the following.
You're correct to point to the speculative influence, since Bitcoin
having the fundamentals it does, and being a commodity that floats
freely in the market, without centralized control - plus being
unregulated - it is a speculator's wildest dream come true. In this
case its exchange value (to fiat) is based on social mood and
perception and not on underlying (fundamental) value. I think that is
what you imply, too.
What is specifically relevant to the wider discussion, is your mention
of *Commodity Money*, because the term accurately describes a major
facet of Bitcoin's function and role.
Bitcoin's exchange rate, as a commodity money floating freely in the
market, will go up and down according to speculative cycles and we
should conceptually separate its valuation in fiat terms, from its
fundamental value which is: mathematical consensus, cryptographic
transaction security and censorship resistance, etc. These values are
critically reliant on Bitcoin's *degree of decentralization* for them
to remain true and for Bitcoin to retain its meaning, and, therefore,
its value. That is what I point out when I say "greater adoption has
not reflected in the price chart". And that may remain the case for
evermore because the value is in the protocol, the blockchain and its
utility and degree of decentralization, not in the chart or the size
of the user base (however, I'm by no means proposing that the user
base be limited - only that it be grown with primary reference to the
requirements imposed by decentralization).
I argue that we already know what the value of Bitcoin is. In its
current form Bitcoin most likely fulfills 80% or 90% of its eventual
fully evolved value. Increased adoption will not strengthen the
fundamentals, so let's proceed with scaling that will safeguard
Bitcoin's fundamental value and implement protections that ensure
quality of decentralization.
Given the start of a new speculative cycle for Bitcoin and the
possibility of a global liquidity crisis in the coming months or
years, block utilization may increase more rapidly than suggested by
current trends. Utilization may ramp up in a spike, so I agree with
suggestions made here for starting tests of a larger blocksize
(2-8MB), or for speeding up blocktime (whichever is technically
Gavin Andresen has committed (if i recall correctly) to tests of 8MB
blocks, so a different size test can be agreed by Core developers.
Once test data and fork outcomes can be reviewed then decision making
has actual parameters to proceed from.

Michael, I snipped some of your comparison example to comment. I agree
with your sentiment to lobby for testing the change and your offer to
provide resources, yet it presents some (surmountable) challenges:
Peter Todd, on 23/06/15, proposed a combined back-test and ongoing
forward test as follows:
"... the creation (via reorg) of a realistic full-load blockchain on
testnet to fully test the real-world behavior of the entire
infrastructure ecosystem, including questions like the scalability of
block explorers, SPV wallets, feasibility of initial syncronization,
scalability of the UTXO set, etc. While this is of course inconvenient
- - 2 years of 8MB blocks is 840GB worth of data..."
So, with a working dataset of that size, jumping to 8MB is excluding a
lot of participants and contributors to the testing - someone like
myself for example.
And this then leads back to the core issue: if an 8MB blocksize
excludes many on this list from testnet, then the proposed 8MB blocks
will exclude a lot of mainnet participants (miners) and degrade the
quality of diversity and decentralization.
How about testing at double the capacity: 2MB?

Sergio Demain,
You and I have had our altercation, in private, about your assumptions
of authority in this community. That was fine when you told me "for
fuck's sake" on IRC. I'm a man and I made you see your error and
apologize for your trespass.
Now, you present me and the list with an interpretation of some higher
goal that an obviously low-level participant, Mike Hearn, is actioning
No. What you espouse is not what Hearn had premeditated. It all
happened in your mind. "Agent" (quoting popular media) Hearn is a
compulsive contrarian and has a verifiable track record of opposing
and arguing against consensus wherever he endevors. According to
Snowden, he did harm to the public and to colleagues vis-a-vis NSA
surveillance while he held office at Google and he is doing the same
via XT. He is no longer at Google - supposedly by free will. I would
venture, from his own stated goals, that he is in Bitcoin in search of
a salary, even though he displays a fundamental lack of understanding
of Open Source methodology and ideology. And a misconception of
Bitcoin's ability to scale.
The self-proclaimed glory of bitcoinj is a false and empty claim. I
have had to code my nodes to ignore bitjoinj because of its disregard
for protocol policy. For numerous reasons they are more of an irritant
than a positive presence on the network.
You, Lerner, not having an issue with his fallacious position and
actions, speaks about you, too. But you "have nothing for or against
Mike personally" so he's just another participant, regardless of his
behavior and track record, then you give him a thumbs up? Many, maybe
a majority, including Satoshi, have expressed deplorement of O'Hearn
and Andresen. With or without Satoshi you can see the terminal
consensus breach these two populists had engaged in for yourself.
Please answer me and the list how their action does not warrant
rejection from the community?
Yet, for the rest of list members: Agent Hearn, a known co-operative,
shows up with challenges and you respond as if to an equal? A former
head-man, before things fell apart, now an accomplice of Agent Hearn,
Andresen, sprays criticism and you dutifully answer, as if to a Big
Man? Who is he? That self-proclaimed grumpy old-timer? "Run to Google
benchmarks" and there you go. Google? Come on! This is the man who
broke the fundamental consensus rule and now he's got you introducing
Google dependencies into Bitcoin? You're OK with that? Go to XT, you
won't find me or anyone in the community objecting to you and Gavin
playing with Google and all sorts of prefab code there.
Sergio, don't presume to tell me or the list what another man is
saying or what rhythmless jive he's playing. Like everyone here, I
have eyes to see and a mind to comprehend: Hearn is not capable of the
double-play you imply. Nor are you, for that matter. So, thanks for
cutting the cake and showing your true colors, but best you don't
speak for someone else. Speak for yourself so everything is clear and
allegiances don't taint you and whatever you may want to speak, for
yourself, later.

In the coming fee market crunch, any speculator would trade an
extended block in the implied direction and also hedge in the opposite
direction in case it gets rejected.
The speculative public will most likely trade in the same direction,
initially, but arbitrage and futures markets perspectives (generally
more informed) will go the opposite way and create a new chart pattern
that will precede contrarian price motion.
In the end, as the community illusion of non-interdependce fades, we'd
expect bitcoin price to tend to its natural condition: parity with the
most powerful fiat currency out there: the psychological King, the US
After decades we could expect an inverse correlation to develop as the
