Dumping out a separate, extra static QT binary is a great idea.

Yes. Tails 1.1, based on Wheezy, will be out on June 10: -Kristov Atlas

Hey Wladimir,
Thanks for building this binary. The initial problem with Qt was resolved, and I was able to load the GUI that chooses my datadir. After choosing the default datadir, however, it segfaulted.
The segfault came after the usual message that I get when running Bitcoin Core in Tails, which is the "sendto: Operation not permitted" message since Core will not be able to connect to the internet without going through Tails' Tor SOCKS proxy. When I specify the SOCKS proxy through the command-line, I get a brief flash of the GUI before it segfaults again.
The "Bus::open" and "IBusInputContext::createInputContext" messages are atypical and might be related to the segfault.
Sample terminal output for latest Tails (0.23):
amnesia at amnesia:~/linux-4765b8c-gitian-2d48b96/32$ ./bitcoin-qt
Bus::open: Can not get ibus-daemon's address.
IBusInputContext::createInputContext: no connection to ibus-daemon
sendto: Operation not permitted
Segmentation fault
amnesia at amnesia:~/linux-4765b8c-gitian-2d48b96/32$ ./bitcoin-qt
Segmentation fault
amnesia at amnesia:~/linux-4765b8c-gitian-2d48b96/32$ ./bitcoin-qt -proxy=127.0.0.1:9050
Segmentation fault

Can anyone summarize the current status of the bounty? I see nothing definite about the bounty in that thread from the beginning of January 2014, other than that the multisig address continues to accumulate bitcoins. Meanwhile, on other mailing lists, I've seen some talk about paying a portion or the whole of the bounty to the Dark Wallet team.

Nice work! I can confirm that this dev binary runs smoothly in the latest version of Tails, v1.0. Screenshot proof here [1]. When this is incorporated into the next release of Bitcoin Core, will this make the usual Linux binary compatible, or will there be a special binary just for systems running the older Qt?
