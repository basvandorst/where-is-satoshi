@_subject: [bitcoin-dev]  BIP- & SLIP-0039 -- better multi-language support 
Hello everyone,
I just realized that BIP-0039 is language dependent. I was assuming the
other way till I looked closer. The way the seed is derived from a BIP-0039
entropy, as is shown below, depends on which language to generate the
mnemonic sentence:
   Entropy <=> Mnemonic Sentence => PBKDF2 => BIP-0032 Seed
Therefore when a user choose a non-English mnemonic code he or she is stuck
with that language. Meanwhile only a few native languages are supported.
SLIP-0039 does not solve this issue in a user friendly way by providing
only an English wordlist. That's understandable as it aims to provide SSS
capability. However those users who do not speak English or recognize
English words will suffer.
What I am trying to bring to attention of the community is that, no matter
if we make a new version of BIP-0039, or a new BIP (with SSS support), or
to enhance SLIP-0039, we really need to address this language issue.
Here are what I propose:
1. The mnemonic code should be only a representation of underlying entropy
or (pre) master secret, seed, whatever. In this way, the same seed/secret
could be displayed in English or in Chinese or other languages. Then there
could be 3rd party conversion tools to support translations in case any
wallet software or device does not support all specified languages. Now it
looks like:
   Mnemonic Sentence <=> Entropy => PBKDF2 => BIP-0032 Seed
2. Given that only 8 languages are supported in BIP-0039, we should allow
the seed/secret to be represented in decimal numbers, each ranging from 0
to 2047. So those who cannot find a native language support yet having
difficulty coping words in other languages could choose to just use numbers.
So far I don't have a preference how this should be implemented. I'd like
to hear from community first.

words, while keeping the bip32 root seed they generate unchanged?
What is the usecase for this?
Yes and no. Yes that the inter-operability will be much better if the
same seed could be recorded as in English and in other languages
as well. There could be a standalone 3rd party tool to convert
mnemonic sentences from one language to another so wallets
do not have to support all languages. This, in reality, does not make
any wallet more complicated or increase any dev costs.
No that I don't think anyone would switch language for fun.
And I think the symmetric function in SLIP-0039 is a good
idea to help with migration the existing wallets. So this will look like:
Japanese                      <=> entropy <=> sym. KDF <==> BIP32 seed
Decimal numbers
into Electrum seeds. They are language/wordlist agnostic.
So, changing the language is not a requirement. However, the current BIP-39
makes the seed dependent on the language. And I'd like to see it changed.
The change will not further complicates the wallets as we can rely on 3rd
conversion tools to handle different languages.
One additional benefit multiple language support could bring up is, we can
write down the mnemonic sentence in two or more different languages
simultaneously, as a way to do checksum each other.
Regarding Jon's comments:
supporting it.
This also worries me.
Think of the situation that one day, crypto currencies are all over the
Everyone has some coins. Among them many just cannot handle English.
We must provide a way for them to master their crypto assets. Therefore,
as Jon had stressed, it is very important to support multiple languages.
I really don't like it if only English could be used.
And then think of those who do not have a native language wordlist. Allowing
representing the seed in decimal numbers will be helpful.

Hi Everyone,
Thank you very much in this thanks giving day for the detailed and well
thought out responses. :)
Steven Hatzakis via bitcoin-dev >:
*>* generated in the first place, such as by hashing the entropy instead of the
*>* words. Any thoughts on how viable that could be where the initial entropy
*>* is fed into the PBKDF2 function and not the words?*
If we go this direction, I'd suggest that we pull Shamir's Secret Sharing
into the game. Trezor's
SLIP-0039 proposal is great and has many security aspects already covered.
However, it does
not allow any language other than English and Trezor team clearly stated
that no other language
will be supported.
While I really want to keep the language independent design. So in the
revision, I'd like to see
a language id (allocated to each one having a defined wordlist) in the SSS
share, as well as
share id, threshold, index, share value, checksum etc.
Regarding checksum scheme, SLIP-0039 proposals a 3-word Reed-Solomon
design. It has a very
good error checking capability but not very good at providing hints to
error recovery. Trezor team
opposes to the idea of providing hints to users regarding how to fix an
error. This could lead to
difficulties for some vendors, and in small probability, confusions to
users (when there is a 2-word
I do agree with Trezor team that it should be users' responsibility to
recover from a detected error.
However, there is a better way than solely rely on checksum. That is, as in
our revision, we can
support mnemonic in multiple languages simultaneously, why don't we use two
languages, or one
language + numbers to check each other? In Steven's example (language id,
share id, etc. skipped)
we could record a SSS share (assuming it is one of the shares just for the
sake of example) like:
*>* valley globe shift
*>* *In Spanish*: mercado faja soledad tarea evadir aries gafas peine bu?ho
*>* tumor gerente reja*
*>* valley globe shift*
794, 1582*
Then software will have to check checksum as well as to check if words
match each other. For
example, "minimum"'s index value in English wordlist should equal to "
*mercado*"'s in Spanish,
or should equal to 1128.
If any error is detected, combining the checksum value and dual-encoding
information, it is much
easier to figure out which word was handprinted incorrectly.
BTW, it is very error prone to handprint. Some study suggests about 0.9%
per word rate. See
Hotopf [1980]
W sample (written exam). Per word
It is important to have an error recovery mechanism easy to understand and
