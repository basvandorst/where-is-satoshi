In that case it didn't remedy the problem of constantly full blocks, but
got a ton of people on board the bitcoin train in the meanwhile. And with
them more interest, investments, research and ideas.
In the case we increase the limit and no government or banking group
immediately uses up all the space in blocks, it of course would prevent
constantly full blocks for the time being. Bitcoin keeps working reliably,
is fast and cheap -- more users on board the bitcoin train. And as long as
we do not immediately increase it to 1.6GB (something no one is
suggesting), we could still maintain a good level of decentralization,
maybe even increase it together with an increase in users.
Eventually we'll have to deal with the fading subsidy, but there's no
reason to deal with it at this point in time. What we need today is more
users and artifically limiting the blocksize doesn't help with that. At the
very least we should try to incorporate technological growth into bitcoin.
Keep the 2010 1MB limit, but account for "inflation". If you're arguing
that noone can predict the future development of bandwidth, cpu and storage
I'd say it doesn't matter if we are too optimistic, because when we start
seeing that a future doubling of the limit will cause major issues, it will
be easy to find consensus and change the rule accordingly.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Simplifying the blocksize limit debate 
I'm going to list a few assumtions / observations / understandings around
this debate. Please point out the incorrect ones.
* Most developers here agree that 1 MB is not a magic constant and that the
limit has to increase eventually.
* Most developers want to reduce the amount of policy decisions
bitcoin-core makes as much as possible.
* The most conservative option for the 4 billion dollar system that is
bitcoin is to keep the limit.
* Technological growth in bandwidth, cpu and storage exists and relative to
that growth, the blocksize limit is effectively decreased. Keeping the
limit as it is today, or was five years ago, means we need to adjust for
technological growth.
* Doing so will not reduce current decentralization, however measured.
* Increasing the blocksize limit will always require a hard-fork.
Decreasing, or stopping the growth of the blocksize limit will always be
possible via soft-fork.
* Problems arising from underestimating the need for a larger blocksize
limit are increasingly harder to fix. Problems arising from a limit that is
getting too high are more easy to fix.
* This means we can be optimistic when estimating future technological

Maybe we should first gather concrete estimates about and roughly agree on
- how long SW (SF) development will probably take
- how long the ecosystem needs to prepare for a hardfork (SW (HF) or a
simple can kicking block size increase)
Opinions differ wildly from what it looks like, but maybe we can get to
estimates that the majority here can accept.
Personally, I think that the disclaimer "Bitcoin is an experiment" is
pervasive. It's still a pre-release, even with a $6bn vote of confidence.
If you don't follow developments in this phase, don't upgrade and then have
an elevated risk of losing money by getting scammed, then that's a little
bit your fault. I'd absolutely support a change in mentality on that once
1.0.0 arrives, but until then is bitcoin a work-in-progress experiment and
a high risk investment.
A planned hard-fork is an experiment that needs to be run anyway. When do
we want to do that, if not now?

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Block size following technological growth 
I agree and would say that this is the only prediction of bitcoin's future
we can be absolutely sure of: more users equals more decentralization as
long as the cost of running a node is not prohibitively high.
It's incredibly cheap today and won't be too high with any of the current
proposals for the time being. If the "laws" of Nielsen & co suddenly don't
apply anymore, we can always react to that with another hardfork reducing
the rate of growth. Hardforks are way easier if the network is in danger
and the necessary change is obvious and non-controversial (e.g. "reduce
blocksize limit growth").
As long as hobbyists can participate in running the network and it's
affordable for everyone to transact on it, bitcoin will grow and its
decentralization with it, however you measure it.

The same can be said about the other camp.
BitcoinXT is not going to fork the chain on a specific date no matter what.
People will be able to vote via block versions and once a sufficient
majority supports the extensions, everyone else will have a grace period to
upgrade. Only after that is a very small minority at risk of losing money.
That being said, I'd rather see a solution that everyone agrees on. My
personal opinion/hope is that Mike and Gavin are just applying pressure
where it's needed. But in the end, they can do whatever they want if they
have the necessary support. Permissionless innovation is one of bitcoins
virtues. In the end, only adoption will decide what bitcoin is and isn't.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Yet another blocklimit proposal / compromise 
I propose to:
a) assess what blocklimit is currently technically possible without driving
up costs of running a node up too much. Most systems currently running a
fullnode probably have some capacity left.
b) set the determined blocklimit at the next reward halving
c) then double the blocksize limit at every halving thereafter up to a
hardlimit of 8GB.
Doubling every four years will stay within expected technological growth.
Cisco's VNI forecast predicts a 2.1-fold increase in global average fixed
broadand speed from 2014 to 2019. Nielsen's law, which looks more at the
power user (probably more fitting) is even more optimistic with +50% per
This proposal can be considered a compromise between Pieter's and Gavin's
proposals. While the growth rate is more or less what Pieter proposes, it
includes an initial increase to kickstart the growth. If we start with 8MB,
which seems to be popular among miners, we would reach 8GB in 2056 (as
opposed to 2036 in BIP101). The start date (ca. mid 2016) is also a
compromise between Pieter's 01/2017 and Gavin's 01/2016.
It's simple, predictable and IMHO elegant -- block subsidy halves,
blocksize limit doubles.
It might make sense to update the limit more often in between, though.
Either completely linearly based on a block's timestamp like in BIP101, or
for example for each difficulty period.

nodes for decentralisation security.
Yes, and I'm suggesting to define what "reasonably convenient" is in 2016.
Most likely node operators have more than a little headroom for larger
blocks. If you just use more of the processing power / storage / bandwidth
you very likely already paid for then there is no increase in costs.
8MB, that was a cap on the maximum they felt they could handle with current
network infrastructure.
And what they felt "remained fair to all to all miners and node operators
worldwide." Increasing network connection requirements might even decrease
mining centralization right now.

transactions with info about the capabilities of the node that created
it might be interesting? Might be useful to gauge economic support for

I think one could make the argument that the only people who talk

who can tell the difference very easily.
To me, your example seems to try hard to make the case for a problem
that won't exist in reality.
Bitcoin (BTC), Millibitcoin (mBTC) and Microbitcoin (?BTC) is the
stop people from using something that's easier to deal with as I just
had to google the ? character again.
Let's also keep in mind that Coinbase has been using "bits" as the
default for over 2 years now:
Just from a linguistic standpoint, chances are we'll end up with bits
anyway. Why fight it? We don't have a SI prefix educational mandate.

Wouldn't this actually *need* to be a bitcoin address that is included in a

malicous nodes could lie and claim to have seen a brand new node id years

Even if included in a block, people could sell their aged IDs (if we were

Also funding that ID address would might tie your economic activity (or
even identity) to a node.
