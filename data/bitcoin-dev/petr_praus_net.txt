An attacker would have to find a collision between two specific pieces of
code - his malicious code and a useful innoculous code that would be
accepted as pull request. This is the second, much harder case in the
birthday problem. When people talk about SHA-1 being broken they actually
mean the first case in the birthday problem - find any two arbitrary values
that hash to the same value. So, no I don't think it's a feasible attack
vector any time soon.
Besides, with that kind of hashing power, it might be more feasible to
cause problems in the chain by e.g. constantly splitting it.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Implementing trading across chains 
I intend to implement trading across chains in a P2P manner (as described
by Mike Hearn in
Note, this is indended more as an alternative chain development, I don't
have any plans for merging it back into main client (not because I don't
want to, but because I think it wouldn't be accepted). Before I dive into
it, I thought it might be a good idea to ask here if the community has any
useful ideas or comments on this topic?
Thanks to Gary Rowe I know about Open
They can do "multicurrency trading" too, but it's objectives are quite
ambitious and I'm looking at making relatively small changes in the
mainline Bitcoin client rather than diving into something entirely new.
A little background on why am I doing this, can be found
In short it's part of research towards my Master's thesis (more precisely,
an excuse to hack on Bitcoin and sell it as research :)) which should be
about multicurrency (alternative chains) in Bitcoin.
PS: I hope I'm not too off topic here, but
this thread
indicates it should be fine to post alternative development questions on

Jorge, thanks for bitcoinx tip, I didn't know about it and it's certainly
related. I'll have a closer look
Regarding Ripple, I tried it but as far as I can tell, it doesn't have any
contract enforcement (by technical means) built in.

BitcoinJ is storing parsed blocks (not the whole chunks of bytes) in H2, an
embedded SQL database for Java.

I think it's worth noting that quite a large portion of Linux users
probably get the mainline Bitcoin client from the packages. I think Bitcoin
package maintainers are doing mostly a pretty good job :)
