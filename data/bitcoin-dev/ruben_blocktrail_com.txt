The idea is more like BIP44/45 to have a 'standard' that software can
comply by and express they do
so that it makes a step towards compatibility between (wallet) software.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] convention/standard for sorting public keys 
For p2sh multisig TXs the order of the public keys affect the hash and
there doesn't seem to be an agreed upon way of sorting the public keys.
If there would be a standard (recommended) way of sorting the public keys
that would make it easier for services that implement some form of multisig
to be compatible with each other without much hassle and making it possible
to import keys from one service to another.
I'm not suggesting forcing the order, just setting a standard to recommend,
there doesn't seem to be much reason for (new) services to not follow that
Ryan from BitPay broad this up before (
 and in bitcore
they've implemented lexicographical sorting on the hex of the public key.
In a short search I can't find any other library that has a sorting
function, let alone using it by default, so bitcore is currently my only

Since we only need the sorting for creating the scriptPubKey,
wouldn't it make the most sense to sort it by the way it represented in
that context?
