@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] separate out blockchain db and wallet to two 
This idea is from a Debian user [1].
What do you think of moving the > 2 GB db to $HOME/.cache/bitcoin and
leaving the wallet and other config files in $HOME/.bitcoin? This is
so backups can skip the .cache directory and the proposal follows the
freedesktop.org XDG Base Directory Specification [2]. Personal
info/settings stays in .bitcoin/ and everything that can be rebuilt
goes to .cache/bitcoin/ I know users can do a work around and set it
up themselves with symlinks, but interested in what you guys think.

Many new users have started using the reference client which downloads
the whole blockchain from peers. There currently isn't a throttling
mechanism [1] so it's possible to quickly eat up your bandwidth. You
can try QoS on your router or use the -nolisten command line flag. You
will still relay transactions, just not serve the whole blockchain.

Hi Mike,
Debian's bitcoin is maintained on an open and archived mailing list
and git repo:
Debian Bitcoin Packaging Team If there is a problem or question, getting an answer should be really
easy. It would be good to include them in the discussion there (I
distribution packaging is not in the best interest of the project,
then I personally would defer to their judgement and request removal.
I'm leaving this open for other opinions from the Debian side.
That said, let me summarize the arguments and see if we can figure out
a permanent solution:
1) It appears that the consensus of upstream developers is that any
distributed binary should only be linked against libraries that the
bitcoin developers have tested and audited since any compatibility bug
is a risk to both the user and the network.
Response: Is there a way to "certify" the Debian libraries? Debian
bitcoind/bitcoin-qt runs the compile test during all architectures.
MIPS has been failing recently, but no one has looked into it yet.
Perhaps it's not worth developers efforts yet, but at some point the
technology should reach a point it can be redistributed.
2) Bitcoin is new technology, so any patches have the ability of
harming both the network and user.
Response: I, and I'm sure everyone else working on it, totally agrees.
All patches are public [1], you can see that the patches are only to
the build system (except for one adding a debug message). Is there a
specific patch or bug that is problematic? This seems to be
reiterating (1) above: don't patch the build system to use libraries
that were not audited by the developers.
The two solutions are: (1) no one besides the upstream developers
compiles and distributes binaries, ever, or (2) upstream comes up with
a system where someone besides them can compile working binaries for
distribution. Most likely the best solution is to do (1) until
upstream sets up a system to allow (2).
I'm curious as to other's opinions.

before people get too upset, I'm talking about little-endian MIPS

The above is a key point, lukejr addressed it well "I think it is
likely all this additional work/delays will be considered unacceptable
to your library/security teams, thus using the bundled/embedded
LevelDB is probably the best solution."
To be clear, bitcoind/bitcoin-qt is only built on little endian machines
The only current modification is to use system leveldb instead of the
packaged leveldb. (There is also a patch porting libmemenv.a to
several other architectures, but that is only used in test suites - so
it shouldn't pose a risk to users).
Ironically, debian (in general) doesn't trust upstream security
maintenance of third part libraries - that's why they typically get
dropped in favor of use system libraries.
In this case, upstream doesn't trust (rightfully) that some future
debian security team bug fix to a stable library won't be tested
properly against bitcoin, causing problems for users (since bitcoin
might expect buggy library behavior).
I'm not the original packager or maintainer - I just came across the
package in really bad shape and helped bring it to something
reasonable and have done the most recent uploads (since 0.8, I
believe). Since updated libraries could pose a security risk because
bitcoin may expect buggy behavior, I think that is a good argument for
debian to use the included library. However, I'm just a recent helper
- I still want to hear what people who have been doing this for longer

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] About the small number of bitcoin nodes 
(1) and (3) are doable, however, Debian and Ubuntu policies make (2)
very difficult (with the exception of security patches). Micha Bailey
and I worked to get bitcoin removed from Debian and Ubuntu stable
releases because they would not allow (2). There are other mechanisms
that could accomplish (2) (backports, volatile, and updates
repositories), however they are not enabled by default and require
user intervention.
Debian unstable does allow (2) since there is no release, and there is
a package in Debian unstable. That package is blocked from
transitioning to a stable release. We've also blacklisted it from
Ubuntu so that Ubuntu doesn't just autoimport and release the Debian
unstable package in an Ubuntu stable release.
Micha is also working to have all old versions of bitcoin removed from
previous released Ubuntu versions.
Matt C's PPA is the best way of getting (1-3) above on Ubuntu, and the
Debian unstable package is probably the best way of getting (1-3)
above in Debian. Both require users to add a line to their apt sources
list; the Debian package would also require apt pinning.
