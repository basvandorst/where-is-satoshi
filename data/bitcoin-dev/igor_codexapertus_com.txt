Hi Antoine et al,
Maybe I'm completely wrong, missing some numbers, and it's maybe fine to
For some months now I've been exploring the feasibility of running full
nodes on everyday phones [1]. One of my first thoughts was how to avoid the
phones mooching off the network. Obviously due to battery, storage and
bandwidth constraints it is not reasonable to expect pocket full nodes to
serve blocks during day time.
Huge exception to this is the time we are asleep and our phones are
connected to wifi and charging. IMO this is a huge untapped resource that
would allow mobile nodes to earn their keep. If we limit full node
operation to sleepy night time the only constraining resource is storage:
512 gb of internal storage in phones is quite rare, probably about $100 for
an SD card with full archival node capacity but phones with memory card
slots rarer still - no one is going to bother.
So depending on their storage capacity phone nodes could decide to store
and serve just a randomly selected range of blocks during their nighttime
operation. With trivial changes to P2P they could advertise the blocks they
are able to serve.
If there comes a time that normal full nodes feel DoS'ed they can challenge
such nodes to produce the blocks they advertise and ban them as moochers if
they fail to do so. Others may elect to be more charitable and serve
These types of nodes would truly be part-timing since they only carry a
subset of the blockchain and work while their operator is asleep. Probably
should be called part-time or Sleeper Nodes?.
They could be user friendly as well, with Assume UTXO they could be
bootstrapped quickly and while they do the IBD in the background instead of
traditional pruning they can keep the randomly assigned bit of blockchain
to later serve the network.
Save for the elderly, all the people I know could run such a node, and I
don't live in a first world country.
There is also the feel-good kumbaya aspect of American phone nodes serving
the African continent while the Americans are asleep, Africans and
Europeans serving the Asians in kind. By plugging in our phones and going
to sleep we could blanket the whole world in (somewhat) full nodes!
