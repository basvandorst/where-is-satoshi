There must be a way to organize ?branches? of smaller activity to join main tree after they grow. Outsider a bit, I see going circles here, but not everything must be accepted in the chain. Good idea as it is, it?s just too early to record every sight?.

Can there be a minimum amount to put up for mining ? I hope i?m not in violation with any ideology yet :)
