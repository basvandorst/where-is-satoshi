@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] BIP: Custodial Identities 
As suggested before submitting a BIP, I am sending this to the mailing list.
Bitcoin is often described as ?the currency of the Internet?, ?the TCP/IP
of money?, or simply ?the Internet of Money?. What is needed is an optional
identity layer ? a Bitcoin Assigned Custodial Identities Authority, much
like the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, to oversee global Custodial
Identity allocation. Such an authority delegates Custodial Identity Spaces
to Regional Bitcoin Custodial Identity Registries, much like the RIRs
(Regional Internet Registries) managing the allocation of Internet number
A Bitcoin Custodial Identity (BCI) account address would consist of a
Custodial Identifier allocated by the BACIA/RBCIRs (much like a bank?s
routing number), and an account address (much like an account number).
Bitcoin Custodial Identities allow dispute resolution in the legal system
for transactions in the BCI address space. Free market would drive and
determine the demand for custodial accounts. P2PKH users not affected.
Feedback is appreciated.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] BIP: Custodial Identities 
Thank you for your feedback regarding Custodial Identities. I will address
it to the mailing list for transparency.
Think of it as a 1-of-2 multisig edge case where Custodian Identities are
actively managed by the Bitcoin Assigned Custodial Identities
Authority/Regional Bitcoin Custodial Identity Registries. Once the optional
identity layer is integrated, there are so many applications beyond dispute
resolution, if you could effortlessly inject Custodian Identities into the
blockchain itself as easily as providing 1-of-2 public keys.
Bitcoin Custodial Identities can be applied to coinbase transactions as
well, in any or all jurisdictions, thus providing further incentive to keep
nodes honest, or enabling a recovery mechanism in catastrophic failure
events, such as a break in SHA-256. Custodians provide account addresses
out of unused address space further alleviating address collisions as a
psychological barrier to adoption. Custodial to non-custodial transactions
could behave much like the UTXO of a coinbase transaction, which has the
special condition that it cannot be spent (used as an input) for at least
100 blocks. It's based on open market competition, and there will probably
always be users willing to live outside of the BCI address space.

I'll pick up where you left off, Jeff. The thought process behind the
Bitcoin Core threading model, platform support, libification, dependency
management, core data structures, DoS mitigation, script evolution,
scalability roadmap... just to scratch the surface, is likely never going
to be apparent entirely from the source code itself, and will not, in its
current form, be easily understood before digesting repository docs, repo
issues, pull requests, IRC logs, mailing list archives (open and closed),
forum posts, wiki articles, historical repositories, the foundation's
technical blog, whitepapers, to name a few. I'd rather not guess how many
have got a grip on it. If any, across the entire spectrum. It may be the
bottleneck to address. I encourage everyone to take a look at the C#
Language Design Notes* on codeplex. We'll know we've met the challenge when
folks are no longer digging up gmaxwell's IRC comments to understand the
rationale on nScriptCheckThreads, nor having to refer to sipa's
stackexchange to figure out chainstate & blockindex key/value pairs.

When forgoing bootstrapping due to disk space constraints, you, and the
network, are likely better off -reindex-ing from current blk000??.dat files.
Which brings up an interesting point: The improvements related to the
headers first approach are likely to increase, how ever marginally, the
percentage of block exchange-related traffic, as it is less painful now to
be catching up.
It'd be interesting to see the statistics, not from a single node
perspective, but from the viewpoint of an Internet backbone provider, say
through the cables coming ashore in Cornwall. For the incurred bandwidth
expense would invariably trickle down to transaction fees in an equilibrium
There is an opportunity somewhere in this.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] A look back and a look forward 
Alex Daley recently stated that "one of the problems with Bitcoin is that
it takes us backwards in the transaction chain. Suddenly, you're dealing
with something that's much more cash-like. If Target had been hacked, and
instead of using credit-cards, what was stolen from them were actually
bitcoins, that they have been storing Bitcoin addresses in their systems
and those systems were compromised, Target wouldn't just have a PR
nightmare in their hands. They would be out of business."
Of course, it needn't be Target. The scenario has played out with a number
of exchanges, and is a sword of Damocles hanging over the cryptocurrency
space. The recent Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust SEC filing warns that "the
Trust?s bitcoins may be subject to loss, damage, theft or restriction on
access. There is a risk that part or all of the Trust?s bitcoins could be
lost, stolen or destroyed. The Sponsor believes that the Trust?s bitcoins
held in the Trust Custody Account will be an appealing target to hackers or
malware distributors seeking to destroy, damage or steal the Trust?s
bitcoins. Although the Security System?s design includes various elements,
such as redundancy, segregation and cold storage, to minimize the risk of
loss, damage and theft, neither the Custodian nor the Sponsor can guarantee
that the Security System will prevent such loss, damage or theft..."
This needn't be so, once an optional identity layer, modeled after the
Internet itself, is provided, as proposed in late August of last year on
this mailing list:
I hope it is apparent that this is the killer app folks have been searching
for in vain. Like its Internet analogues, BCIs will not be created
overnight and without collaboration - and TNABC is as good a place as any
for it.

Let me translate it to this year's vocabulary. Think of BCIs as a
sidechain: let the legacy financial system migrate, to the extent desired,
to a more heavily regulated pegged sidechain with a stronger identity
layer. Let protocol-level rules regulate this nexus between the custodial
(sidechain) and non-custodial address spaces (blockchain). This isn't
entirely unlike the rules currently governing coin issuance i.e. coinbase
transactions. Let the market forces play it out. Iterate as needed. I
suspect that in retrospect it'll seem obvious. Many moons from now the
balance might shift between the two, but it won't matter much. The system
will have means to recover from catastrophic failure modes.
To help internalize such an evolution, please consider the layers the
Bitcoin protocol builds on top of: segment 52:32 ("The Internet is being
upgraded") of the BBC documentary "Inside The Dark Web" (
 Kaspersky's comments a
few minutes earlier (50:06) aren't entirely out of context here either.
Clearly, the need is acute for Bitcoin to become institutional i.e. for
"billions of dollars of human value" to flow through it, as one Money 20/20
participant put it.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Why Bitcoin is and isn't like the Internet 
This is a response to a wonderfully insightful recent post by Joichi Ito,
the Director of the MIT Media Lab. In it, Dr. Ito, notably a former Board
Member of ICANN, offered his thoughts on "Why Bitcoin is and isn't like the
Internet" and asked a most pertinent question: "Whether there is an ICANN
equivalent needed for Bitcoin." As suggested in recent posts to the mailing
list, I believe there might be, but for a reason that may not seem obvious
at first.
Alan Reiner expressed the need this way: "I think one of the biggest issues
facing Bitcoin right now is not the lack of a 'killer app.' It is lack of
insurance options. Early adopters would like to believe that the majority
of users will hold their own Bitcoin, but I believe that is not a realistic
option when life-changing quantities of Bitcoin are involved. We should not
trust Grandma to secure her own retirement savings via complicated computer
maneuvers. More to the point, she should not trust herself or anyone else
(sic!) to hold it unless there is a strong protection against loss events.
Right now the solution is for Grandma to avoid keeping her money in
Bitcoin. Bitcoin needs a strong backbone of insured storage options so that
Grandma can confidently participate in this new technology." This is
certainly an observation to take heed of coming from the founder of Armory
The protection against loss events ought to be understood in the broadest
sense. What is needed is a disaster recovery mechanism. Andreas
Antonopoulos remarks expressed this candidly last year: "Bitcoin doesn't
have a middle of the road mediocre growth model. It basically either dies,
because of a fundamental flaw in the Bitcoin system. Not an external
factor, an internal factor: We blow it up by accident. And that could
happen... Bitcoin will play out in the next three years. In the next three
years we're going to see Bitcoin arrive on the global stage and make a
substantial impact, both in financial terms and in political terms. It will
happen. Or it will die. Either way. I'm not sure. In which case we'll
reboot another currency."
A body, not entirely unlike ICANN, can manage the nexus to the physical
world, and help address Bitcoin's catastrophic failure modes. Bitcoin's
coin ownership protocol would thus join the ranks of its payment protocol,
coin issuance protocol, consensus mechanism and inflation control that pose
no lethal threat to the ecosystem. In addition to their coin-agnostic
nature, I suspect the high valuation of large Bitcoin hubs relative to
Bitcoin's market cap at this stage in its lifecycle is partly reflective of
the sneaking suspicion that a custodial bitcoin (a bitcoin attached to an
identity) may be worth more than a non-custodial one. With this in mind,
I'll pitch in for the ticket should Dr. Ito decide to join the next month's
DevCore Boston conference aimed at supporting the future development of
Bitcoin. It's an hour's walk from MIT after all.

I am more fazed by PR 5288 and PR 5925 not getting merged in, than by this
thread. So, casting my ballot in favor of the block size increase. Clearly,
we're still rehearsing proper discourse, and that ain't gonna get fixed
here and now.
