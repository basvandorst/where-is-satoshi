@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Review for slides for "defeating trojans" 
This is way off the point, but please write Bitcoin, not BitCoin.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Social network integration (brainstorm) 
The Trsst project (Twitter + RSS + Google Reader = Trsst social network)
has some interesting ideas:
   In Trsst, every user account is a digital wallet. Authors and
   individual pieces of content can receive secure and anonymous
   micro-payments of digital crypto-currency, enabling long-
   envisioned content monetization schemes where authors receive
   small payments each time their content is consumed, shared,
   or "liked".

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Meta suggestions for this block size debate 
My fingers have been itching many times now, this debate
drives me nuts.
I just wish all posters could follow two simple principles:
1. Read up. Yes. All of what has been written. Yes, it will
   take many hours. But if you're rehashing what other
   smarter people have said over and over before, you're
   wasting hundreds of peoples time. Please don't.
2. Be helpful. Suggest alternatives. Just cristizising is
   just destructive. If you want no change, then say so.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] User vote in blocksize through fees 
with all due respect, but I've seen you saying this a few times
now, that this decision is oh so difficult and important.
But this is not helpful. We all know that. Even I.
Make a suggestion, or stay out of the debate!
