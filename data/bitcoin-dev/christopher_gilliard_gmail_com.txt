@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP proposal - Signatures of Messages using Bitcoin 
I have written up a proposed BIP. It has to do with Signature formats when
using Bitcoin Private keys. It is here:
This BIP was written up as suggested in this github issue:
Note that the proposal is inline with the implementation that Trezor
implemented in the above issue.
Any feedback would be appreciated. Please let me know what the steps are
with regards to getting a BIP number assigned or any other process steps

The proposal includes actual code that does verification, but I didn't
include code for signing. I thought it could be inferred, but I could at
least include a description of how to sign. I am not sure exactly what part
you are referring to by "keys speech", but the signatures are done by ECDSA
keys so it's hard to not include anything about keys even though that's not
the main topic. The "Background on ECDSA keys" section was mainly meant to
give background about what kind of keys Bitcoin uses, for people who
already know that they can easily skip this section so I would probably
think it's best just to leave in.  Maybe it should be at the end as an
addendum though. Yes, I did not invent any of this, I'm just documenting
what people actually seem to do because I had to verify signatures as part
of a project I'm working on. I would have liked to have had this document
when I started the project so I thought it might be useful to others since
as far as I can tell this was not specified anywhere. The reason for
including this data in the header is the same that compressed/uncompressed
is included in the header so that you know which type of key the signature
is from and you don't have to try all options to see if any matches. This
is why Trezor did that way and why I documented it. I'm sure there are
other ways to do this, but since this is out there in the field being used
and is a reasonable solution, I thought I'd write it up.

Trying the four possible options (p2pkh compressed, p2pkh uncompressed,
seg3, and bech32) is certainly a possibility and in fact, that's what I
ended up doing because not every wallet implements something like this, but
if there is a header field currently in use, it seemed reasonable to me to
use it specify which type of key is being used. If the header includes
whether the key is compressed or not compressed it seems logical to include
all data about what type of key it is and not just this one type of
information. That's why I thought the solution made sense and I wrote it up.
