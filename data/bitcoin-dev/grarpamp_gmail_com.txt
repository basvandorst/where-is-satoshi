I'll be trying your implementation soon. And libbitcoin/subvertx too.
Partly because they're also non-interpreted, and partly to what seems
better architected...
To the minimal extent of my understanding... I'd like to see wallet
ops completely separated from background chain ops. ie: have
a chain daemon doing it's thing, updating, verifying, etc. The
generator doing it's thing. And a wallet app that can independently
manage separate wallets in parallel, referencing the live chain files
as needed. It seems a library would allow quality focus on the separate
functions and let apps/ui's use the fn's as desired on top. Right now, it
seems I have to run bitcoind and can only deal with one wallet at a time,
having to stop it, deal with state issues, swap in a new wallet, start
it, and repeat till illness ensues :( And when the chain is being processed
hard by the daemon cpuwise, bitcoin RPC takes minutes to respond, if ever
or errors out. If wallet ops or statistical queries on the chain need it for
integrity or reading, a db checkpoint/lock/logroll could be implemented into
the chain demon processes with a client lib api to trigger it as needed.
Don't know, just saying.
fyi... boost 1.48 and db 4.8.30 work fine with 0.5.2, 0.5.x, and master,
you just need to compile and include it by hand if you want it and
your package manager doesn't have it.

A freshly deployed client on an old p4 has been idly crunching away
at building and verifying the initial chain for about a week now. It
should be done in a day or two. This seems rather untenable for
new users. Have any groups published proposals for distributing
a weekly precomputed bootstrap chain?
rsync? db_dump > git > db_load?
There is also 50% or more compression available in the index
and chain.
Of some known future issues... raw transaction rate, the eventual pay
(or extort?, depending on how megapools pan out) to process mining
environment, and scaling the client count itself... this one appears to
be already present.

I meant for anyone who wanted to distribute the dataset as a project.
Rather than use dated/modified packages, I compiled current versions
of all component sources manually.
True. Used them all before, happy with BSD for now. Just knowing
what the general setup is on those zippy systems should suffice.
ie: blindly fishing for such a zippy system to compare through various
install tests doesn't sound too appealing. It's different than benchmarking.
Datapoint: The system below is not zippy.
Am I correct in guessing that, given a certain height, the data
in blkindex and blk0001 should be the same across instances?
# file blk*
blk0001.dat:             data
blkindex.dat:            Berkeley DB (Btree, version 9, native byte-order)
Pursuant to comparison, what is the format of blk0001.dat?
I'm not running Linux with asynchronous data and metadata
turned on by default if that's what you mean :) ZFS, disk crypto,
standard drive write cache. Looking at it, I'm largely buried in
that crypto at 8MB/sec or so.
Hmm, I compiled everything with the defaults. Will go back and
look at bdb options. I don't think there was anything interesting
there. I'd bet a lot is tied to the fs and cpu.
Single core p4 at 1.8 512k/2g isn't much up against ZFS+disk crypto.
It seems to take its time and roll up all but the last database file (of
a hundred or more) on receiving sigterm. Is it supposed to roll
and delete the last log too? Can I safely delete everything but
the blk* files? (wallet excepted of course :)
Currently, in KiB...

Git repos are backed by strong hashes. Each commit could be a single
block dump, perhaps into a file hierarchy. Trusted entities, pools, etc
could sign at a checkpoint/height. Blockchain tools
would need made that can take the blk* and export single blocks and
process/export up to a certain block and quit. Everyone would do a
comparison and sign a commit hash. Everyone else git pulls. Having
the block toolset is a key prequisite to any sort of distribution. They don't
exist now :( Maybe the two bitcoin compatible library projects out there
will implement them :) Torrents are also strongly hashed and could be
signed as well.
Making the blockchain tools would be the most important thing to start.
If that means not validating the chain, then it's as above. I'm not sure if it's
right to not care about the history if only making new transactions with a new
key post install time and then only validating new transactions as they come
in. Will have a look.

My blockchain is up to date. Bitcoin is not running.

This will at times yield the addresses in your wallet.
So it's not exactly in compliance with 'only your wallet file matters'.
Bitcoin always leaves behind at least one "database/log.nnn" file.
Shouldn't it roll and delete it on exit like it does the other state files?
Particularly after a simple "we're able to do nothing but local
operations" invocation
like: bitcoind -proxy=127.0.0.1:9050 -keypool=0 -connect=127.0.0.1
-nodnsseed -noirc
Similarly, the ".lock" file is never deleted.
Shouldn't it be upon exit?
Vacuuming addr, blkindex, and wallet with "db_dump | db_load" will save
significant space. I do not yet know how to view or validate blk0001.dat.
When left with junk, I've been removing everything except:
addr.dat - node addresses
bitcoin.conf - config
blk0001.dat - blocks
blkindex.dat - index to blocks
wallet.dat - wallet

Unfortunately it appears to be just as dead as the one
on sourceforge.
Well there's a couple things I see...
1) Yes, IMO, a real mailing list for users needs to exist.
Among the prior reasons... lists tend to house a more
technical crowd than forums which are magnets for
2) There was originally one client. Now there are many,
all adherant to the same bitcoin spec. So while:
 bitcoin-development at lists.sourceforge.net
represents the dev community for the original client,
it may not, or won't be, for any other client.
And as:
 bitcoin-list at lists.sourceforge.net
was for, and is administratively tied to, the original client...
it may not be the place, or a welcome one, to hold talk of all
the adherant clients.
3) The sourceforge list browsing interface is ridiculously
lame and overweight, and it doesn't appear to be setting
a '^Reply-to: ' header which is bad. Googlegroups would
be an ok site I suppose. And a pure MailMan interface would
be even better and more customarily accepted.
So for the user list, I'd suggest:
1) Search a bit to make sure there's not already a busy list
out there somewhere. Check the list aggregator sites
like markmail, gmane, etc too.
2) Charter it as bitcoin protocol, client agnostic.
3) Find an impartial administrative and robust home for the list
with browsable, searchable and hopefully downloadable archives.
4) Make the announcement to other known client lists/forums.
5) Close any relevant old lists.
6) Promote via similar announcement from time to time.
Description: A place for discussion related to bitcoin.
Is this sufficient charter to go with? Is the creator/maintainer
known impartial? What happens to ongoing list operations when
said people vanish? It is presumed googlegroups itself is robust.

Perhaps not worry about removing it too much. As above, if blocking
or other issues arise, people will be hosting manual lists and nodes
on hidden sites... Tor/I2P/etc. The nodes are already there.
For that matter, since the nodes are talking once seeded, why not
deploy a DHT and be done. All you'd need is one friendly node and
the list comes in and maintains itself through node expiry rules.
Your node publishes its hello for others to discover, etc.
IRC, DNS, etc would go away in favor of autonomy. It wouldn't
be any more resistant. But if people wanted that, some form of
signatures from the hidden nodes would do... if you trusted them.
Booting and running is easy, trust isn't (ask the Tor/I2P people).

Nothing wrong, it's all default install. I documented the platform
for anyone who wants to confirm it.
And what, similarly, is your platform?
It takes 5 seconds... on my Cray.
Use of Tor was stated. Tor is fast enough. I can copy the entire
3GiB of the .bitcoin dir in 7 days... off a slow hidden service.
And 0.5 days via exit.
Encryption is a perfectly reasonable thing to expect users of
bitcoin to be interested in doing. In fact, those not encrypting
their disks should probably rethink that plan.
Well, without detachdb, it's somehow tied to the wallet, whether
while processing or offline. And the wallet and debug.log are
not relocatable from the data. And encrypting everything is perfectly
reasonable anyways. As is storing your valuable data on filesystems
that verify the integrity of their data on disk, such as ZFS/BTRFS.
These days, crypto, Tor, and ZFS are common and non-arguments.
Again, timings with no CPU/OS/disk specs are useless infos.

Don't know what you're using since you've not stated it.
Extra cores help with disk, crypto, net, etc...
I've spent about two weeks crunching about the last month's
worth of new blocks.
The config is reproducible, and not believed to be uncommon.
Mostly disk and crypto.
Shall everyone instead run in bitrot and no-privacy mode?
What do we do when we've got 10k trans a day coming in?
50k? 100k, 1M? When the chain gets 1M, 50M, 500M, 1B long?
Forget my swamped box, these numbers are coming to others.
I'd bet some people using 'tmpfs' probably have it unknowingly
[fall]backed to swap instead of core.
Bitcoin already takes up 3GiB of disk, how many have that much
free RAM? How many have 30GiB, 300GiB?
Yes, I left out that bit of platform so here are the remaining
bits... db4830, boost149, vm.kmem_size=650000000
I'm not bashing anything or anybody, just detailing a stock config
that is underwater. Anybody wishing to verify can get the hardware
from their junk pile and the software from freebsd.org. I'll certainly
be looking at both it and different setups too. If anyone's using
say Linux/BSD, BTRFS/ZFS, crypto, on i386/amd64, they could
chime in with their times too.
Disk is the cheapest, easiest thing for Joe to get. Think about
indexing and checkpointing into said disk. I don't know what
bitcoin's doing, but if it's verifying every transaction back to
the root, that would seem a bit ridiculous.
Joe probably won't be happy buying TiB's for bitcoind, so after that's
filled (assuming there's CPU to do it), the trust model has to change.
These scales are coming...

I'm aware of the memory and i386 issues, and going shopping.
Sync... yes, depending on the rate/sec and size of them, that would be an
issue. "Enterprise" systems with UPS, good disk, etc assume writes are
committed upon return, eliminating need for software apps to do sync. So
I need to figure out how to turn that off?
Is sync on for everything, or just the wallet (where it could be argued as ok)?
Guessing bitcoin's writes are small? So a RAM dev intent would be cheaper
and faster than SSD for that.
I'll try to search that. If it's anything like "delete old blocks/tx/coins that
have both been validated in the past and fully spent in the future since we
no longer need to validate further back beyond them [1]", that would be

Ah ok, coming from cvs/svn, it's a bit different to find things.
There's something to be said for maintenance of pior branches.
Though I see some things I can use in github and my work would
be more useful there, so maybe I'll stwitch to that from gitorius/0.6.x.
Presumably the github/0.6.2 branch is safe for production?
What degree of caution about wallet eating should be
made for those using github/master?

Sorry, that's to be expected, I shouldn't have asked.
Good point.
I usually test compile / report current and stable of things I use.
So I get that github/master is the obvious top of things.
But in looking at where the tags are between repositories,
it's still not clear to me what the workflow is.
There are these release tarballs on sourceforge, which all have
tags in github, yet no tags in gitorious. There are no 'x' branches
on github, yet there is one release applicable branch on gitorious.
I guess I'd expect to see, that if as hinted by Luke that gitorious
has the stable trees, that there would be release tags there, laid
down at some comfy point in time on the 'x' stable branches there.
(The stable branches inheriting new code from master). But there
are no such tags.
And the releases/tags seem to magically appear from nowhere on
github :) Again, I'm trying to extricate myself from CVS here.

Thanks very much, I think that helps me/others. I did not realize
there were release windows in master and thought it more as the
typical full time dev slush. That also explains the presence of all
the release tags in github repo. And even, in a divergent way, the
presence of github/0.6.2 as path to gitorius/0.6.x. And I agree
with the (last bugfix after release) -> import/maintain model, it
would be similar in solo repo.
Yes, that has helped! Now git'ers can easily compare the release
tags to stable 'x' branches on gitorious. I don't know how to do
that across repos yet, save manuel diff of checkouts from each,
which would have been required prior to this update you made.
Also, these declarations of defunctness help sort out too.
# git branch -vv -a
"This stable branch is no longer maintained."
Ok, so for my works I will now track github/master (edge) and
gitorious/0.bigN(eg: 6).x (stable) against gitorious/bigTagRelease
(latest public). Thanks guys, and Luke :)
I hope other with similar questions find this thread. Apology for

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Wallet related bug? 
I think there may be an ideal order of ops bug around rescan,
wallet upgrades/import and last block markers.
I dropped an old wallet in a current blockchain.
First ran - in rescan mode.
It said old walletver.
Then rescanned whole chain.
AddToWallet some blockhash, blocks out of range, invalid/nonwallet txid's,
which were already in there as legit ones in the old logs.
Second run in plain mode.
New wallet ver logged.
Rescanned  the last 20k blocks or so,
which might have been the marker last time the old wallet was used.
Third and later runs... duplicates the second.
Never did say 'upgrading wallet' as it sometimes does.
Running detach=1 always.
Why scan the last 20k every time? Shouldn't have to if
whole chain was scanned. And certainly no more than
once if not.
Dumping the run params (bitcoin.conf, cmdline) to the log would be good.
And not automatically truncate the log when big but just append or roll it.

I had previously commented on this.
My references to wallet ver were really to nFileVersion.
And I've since been able to make that, and the
real walletversion become current.
However it is still doing this every invocation...
 Rescanning last 14xxx blocks (from block 170xxx)...
Which seems unneeded more than 1x. I cannot yet explain.
So I expect to avoid all by send the balance from old
wallets to new wallet soon instead.
The old wallets were ver 10500.

GregM, wasn't sure how to answer your question, and as to
conflicts [1]. I think I grasped it in my reply to something on
tor-talk, which is on its way here pending moderation due to bcc.
I put that part below. The FYI referred to seednodes as
they exist on Tor / I2P today.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Tor hidden service support 
============================== START ==============================
Forward past automoderation...
The document (Tor.txt) assumes the bitcoin user has taken care of
that. So no bi-direction needed (I am not TorProject).
Seems it's used only within bitcoin code to distinguish which proxy
or native IPvN path to send bitcoin traffic to (or receive from).
It might be simpler than managing onions, i2p's and whatever else
throughout the code and the private bitcoin p2p mesh.
Though I don't suspect it will conflict [1] with anyone's use of
OnionCat, GarliCat, or Phantom... it would just feel odd configuring
bitcoin to use Tor or I2P proxy ports (or Phantom native) when you
could conceivably just dump the IPv6 traffic to the OS stack for
handling once you have the *Cat shims and Phantom set up. They do
have a point about about ocat as a shim for their purposes. And
Phantom is a special case in that it's all native IPv6 interface,
no proxy or shim needed or provided.
I will quote an additional note from bitcoin-devel...
"Note that while the hidden service support in bitcoin uses a
compatible IPv6 mapping with onioncat, it is _not_ onioncat, does not
use onioncat, does not need onioncat, and wouldn't benefit from
onioncat. The onioncat style advertisement is used because our
protocol already relays IPv6 addresses. The connections are regular
tor hidden service connections, not the more-risky and low performance
ip in tcp onioncat stuff."
FYI. There have been a dozen or so onion:8333 nodes and maybe some
on I2P long before this work. But I think could only be used as
-connect or -addnode seeds with some extra host setup. Never tried
it since -proxy was sufficient. Seems this is a simpler and full
[1] Well bitcoin wouldn't know to offload traffic to any of those
blocks, or a specific host on them, if you had them set up locally
via *Cat or Phantom... for bitcoin use. It would probably end up
half useful similar to the above FYI. But that would just affect
bitcoin, not whatever else you were running on them.

No, they all do this and build it, subject to their feature set.

It also has some reliable network distribution models (netsync) that work
well over things like Tor, in case a new developer (or old Satoshi) doesn't
wish to be in the public light.
Once you have the crypto, it always boils down to human risk factors,

This isn't really possible. A trojaned client will spend your coin as
easily as the owner can, passphrases will be logged, windows box will
be owned, secondary remote spendauth sigs into the network chain
break similarly, securely hashcheck the trojaned client from cracked
userspace on a hacked dll/kernel with uefi backdoor and a trojaned
hasher, etc.
It's easier for a few developers to meet in person to init and sig

Hardware is a good thing. But only if you do the crypto in the
hardware and trust the hardware and its attack models ;) For
instance, the fingerprint readers you see everywhere... many
of them just present the raw fingerprint scan to the host (and
host software), instead of hashing the fingerprint internally and
using that as primitive in crypto exchanges with the host. They
cheaped out and/or didn't think. So oops, there went both your
security (host replay) and your personal privacy (biometrics),
outside of your control. All with no protection against physical
fingerprint lifting.
Yes, that case would matter zero to the end product. However
having a strong repo permits better auditing of the BTC codebase.
That's a good thing, and eliminates the need to talk chicken and
If no one is verifying the repo, sure, even entire repos could be
swapped out for seemingly identical ones.
Many repos do not have any strong internal verification structures
at all, and they run on filesystems that accept bitrot.
Take a look at some OS's... OpenBSD and FreeBSD, supposedly
the more secure ones out there... both use legacy repos on FFS.
Seems rather ironic in the lol department.
Thankfully some people out there are finally getting a clue on these
issues, making and learning the tools, converting and migrating
things, working on top down signed build and distribution chain, etc...
so maybe in ten years the opensource world will be much farther
ahead. Or at least have a strong audit trail.

People often miss the fundamental reasons Bitcoin exists,
the various conjoined ethos behind its creation. This is to be
expected, it's so far ouside any thinking or life process they've
ever had to do or been exposed to. It's also partly why figuring
out what to do or code or adopt, is hard. And certainly not made
any easier by the long term need and the current value at stake.
Creating a system in which a Botswanan can give a few bits
of their impoverished wages to their friend in Mumbai without
it being gated, permitted, hierarchied, middlemanned, taxed,
tracked, stolen and feed-upon until pointless... this simply
doesn't compute for these people. Their school of thought is
centralization, profit, control and oppression. So of course they
see txrate ramming up against an artificial wall as perfectly fine,
it enables and perpetuates their legacy ways.
Regardless of whichever technical way the various walls are torn down,
what's important is that they are. And that those who are thinking
outside the box do, and continue to, take time to school these
legacy people such that they might someday become enlightened
and join the ethos.
Otherwise might as well work for ICBC, JPMC, HSBC, BNP, MUFG
and your favorite government. Probably not as much fun though.

As you can clearly see, both the HTML archives and the "mbox"
archives have corrupted this message, it will not verify. Do not
try to say this case is trivial, the problem itself is not trivial,
it's gratuitous, and it applies to all matching messages... text,
code, binary inline... that's dangerous.
Do not try to say this corruption prevents spam, it does not.
Spammers simply subscribe to the list and harvest everything
efficiently in realtime... no webcrawling overhead, no stale
addresses. Obfuscation is futile.
This misfeature needs to be disabled.
Yes... these other mirrors, archives, analysis, journalism, and
interfaces are useful. However, as it is now, there are no useful
authoritative sources for them to seed from... they're all corrupt.
And any subscribed realtime sources, though nice, are subject to
downtime, administrative and other unrecoverable gaps. Your mirror
project is a fine idea, you should demand that the pristine historical
sources be made publicly available. Not just for you, but for everyone.
As before, the current "mbox" archives are broken and not useful...
a) They corrupt message data, messages are unverifiable, another example...
      b) They are missing the minimum set of original headers necessary
   for fully replyable, threadable, sortable, searchable, context
   preserving and direct use by users MUA's in their local environment:
   (Date, From, To, Cc, Subject, Message-ID, In-Reply-To, References)
c) They do not include attachments (patches, signatures, images, crypto,
   data) that are absolutely necessary to the context and archives
   of all lists. Instead they stupidly throw them away to "web links"
   which results not only in uselessness of the so called "mbox"
   version, but in many thousands of needless fetches by archive
   users and indexers. And hours of wasted work attempting to
   postprocess them into usable form.
   Valuable content lost from the "mbox" files this June alone:
    418 attachment.html
    106 attachment.sig
      6 attachment.jpe
      4 attachment.png
      2 attachment.bin
d) There appear to be at least 15 instances of unescaped '^From '
   in the "mbox". Regeneration with current mailman may fix. One such
   case is here:
      Please fix all the above mentioned issues by providing the full raw
archives in regularly updated [gzip/7z] mbox format. The internet
