Pieter, I agree with the overall gist of your statement (that Bitcoin is a
consensus-driven protocol that's incompatible with certain forms of central
governance) but I respectfully disagree with some of the conclusions you're
case of controversy is no change_.
(emphasis mine)
I think that there's a disconnect between the idea that Bitcoin Core making
a consensus-driven change in turn means that the network is being forced
down a certain path. This takes away a great deal of the individual agency
that makes Bitcoin what it is today. Upgrading to a version of Bitcoin Core
that is incompatible with your ideals is in no way a forced choice, as you
have stated in your email; forks, alternative clients, or staying on an
older version are all valid choices. If the majority of the network chooses
not to endorse a specific change, then the majority of the network will
continue to operate just fine without it, and properly structured consensus
rules will pull the minority along as well. (For example, re: block sizes,
if the majority of hashing power remains on a version or fork that does not
mine >1MB blocks, a chain of <1MB blocks will continue to be the longest,
and up to date clients will still respect that. That is consensus at work,
pure and simple.)
Obviously Core is in a unique position as a reference client and ignoring
that would be irresponsible. If broad consensus among the developers cannot
be reached, then Core should not make a given change. However, freezing
Core's ability to make changes in light of _any_ controversy is allowing a
few voices to dictate direction and is counter to any kind of
consensus-driven decision making.
Placing Core and its developers on some sort of pedestal where we believe
that they dictate policy and therefore shouldn't be allowed to take any
risks will create the very situation that you're advocating against- that a
small group of developers have control over Bitcoin's policies. Instead, we
should strive to treat Core as _just another Bitcoin Client_, we should
educate users to make informed choices about the version of software they
are running and the choices implicit in that, and we should allow consensus
at the protocol level to make the decisions on the overall direction of the
market develop, and rather sooner than later
I will keep this brief because this is straying off topic of the idea of
this thread- but I don't believe that increasing Bitcoin's capacity as a
network is inherently incompatible with the development of a fee market,
and considering a fee market to be formed of only a single set of variables
(transaction rate versus block size) is not sound economic analysis.

and help do it
One thing that seems to have been forgotten is that the 1MB block size does
not represent any particular rigorous design choice; it is purely arbitrary.
It does not represent any type of technical sweet-spot; it neither falls
under any reasonable MTU to prevent TCP fragmentation, nor does it
guarantee in any unique way ease of transmission or lower latency. Chinese
mining pool operators, noted as one of the more constrained stakeholders in
this decision, have indicated that 8MB is a reasonable compromise in their
situation. Unless individuals with specific, concrete use cases come
forward with exactly how they will be marginalized by blocks in the 1-8MB
range, we should consider 8MB the minimum applicable size for technical
objections to raising the block size from a network propagation point of
It also does not represent any kind of economic sweet spot. If we accept
the arguments on the mailing list that economic incentives for the creation
of the fee market depend entirely on a single variable, the scarcity of
space for transactions in a block, we should be talking about _decreasing_
the block size. In reality, this is clearly laughable. The real economic
analysis would consist of a balance between the space for transactions in a
block, the number of transactions being attempted at any given time, and
the block subsidy, among many other factors. Viewing it in this light, the
chance that 1MB by some divine miracle is the perfect balance of those
economic considerations becomes exceedingly small.
(Personally, I believe that increasing the block size has a greater chance
of creating a fee market after coinbase subsidies decline, as having
competition for space in a block depends not only on the number of
transactions that fit in the block, but also the number of people
attempting to spend; if success rates fall dramatically, significantly
fewer people will attempt to transact bitcoin. However, this is a
discussion for another post).
If we stop considering 1MB to be some magic number, perhaps we can enter
into a real discussion about finding what the right sweet spot is. We very
well may decide that 1MB is _too big_; what should not be acceptable is
conflating pressures to decrease the block size with reasons for inaction
altogether. The end game of this debate should be to decide the new block
size that balances, within reason, the various pressures in every direction.

While I think we'd all prefer Core to make changes like this, the current
environment may make that impossible. If this change happens in XT, we will
support the necessary changes in our own implementation. The block size
limit is a problem _today_, and I'd rather we solve today's problems with
today's understanding rather than let speculation about future unknowns
stop our ability to respond to known issues.
