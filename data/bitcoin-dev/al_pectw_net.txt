How would a (potentially, state-sponsored) netsplit lasting longer than N be handled?

============================== START ==============================
A netsplit cannot be detected but merely be suspected where the p2p protocol does allow arbitrary connecting/disconnecting of any peer: there's no difference between a remote net being split off, that net having nothing to say, and that net choosing to disconnect. Detection then mandates manual, out-
of-band communications, which is error prone and centralising.
I also observe 'stopping nodes' during netsplits introduces several attack vectors. Among them: create a netsplit, which stops the nodes, turn off the netsplit, repeat. A sequence of 365 actors causing their own small netsplits could effectively stop Bitcoin at the cost (to them) of no Internet for one day a year as the rolling netsplit could never be fixed.
I've seen estimates of China hosting more than 51% of hashpower. Say they conduct a netsplit. Does your suggestion mean that it's the rest of the world that has to delete their local history because they lack the hashpower to assert themselves as the proper branch? If so, I think having to delete actual history everywhere across the globe but China is not a price worth paying to limit reorgs to 24 hours.
I am unconvinced that the moving checkpoint you describe would improve

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Pre BIP: Solving for spam and other abuse with an HTLB 
Greetings all, I'm looking for thoughts on the BIPability of a relatively minor change, with an outsize benefit, with the provisional name 'Hashed Time-Locked Bond', HTLB for short.
The minor change is to implement HTLC without its digest element. The outsize benefit is to incentivise against spam and other abuse. In this post I'll introduce the script, motivation, a working proof-of-concept site, and then round out addressing the desirability of a BIP.
Implementation of HTLB:
The script takes the form:     OP_IF
        OP_DUP OP_HASH160                 OP_ELSE
         [TIMEOUTOP] OP_DROP OP_DUP OP_HASH160     OP_ENDIF
    OP_EQUALVERIFY
    OP_CHECKSIG
Notice that this is the script of BIP-0199 with '[HASHOP]  OP_EQUALVERIFY' removed. A worked example. Alice is the buyer and Bob the seller. Alice knows that Bob is her father and that he doesn't know her new email address. She commits 50,000 satoshis to the above script with a 24 hour timeout, then sends proof of that transaction along with an email reintroducing herself. Bob's MUA recognises that the bond is good and alerts him to the email from a strange sender: he knows that if he disagrees with the implicit assertion that he will want that email, he has 24 hours to redeem those funds at the sender's expense. He reads the email. Bob is incentivised not to redeem against his daughter though, and lets the timeout expire: Alice reclaims her funds. Carol did not bond at all, so her email was refused at the server. Dave's bond of 100 satoshis was too small to pass Bob's minimum, so his email too was refused at the server. Erin guaranteed 50,000 satoshis each to reach Bob and ten thousand others with an email offering triple-glazed windows: she's now well on the way to losing them all.
Motivation: There is a transaction class we can identify as 'Good Behaviour Bonds' currently poorly served in Bitcoin*. Bail bonds and bar tabs are real world exemplars. Conceptually, Alice guarantees Bob she will do or be something for a fixed period: if she complies Bob refrains from redeeming her guarantee; if she does not comply Bob redeems some or all of it. It's inherent to the class that Alice is incentivised within the transaction to good behaviour outside it. Conversely, Bob is incentivised outside the transaction to good behaviour within it. In essence, Alice commits funds to a penalty in advance of a connection to Bob. Alice is incentivised by getting her funds back, Bob is incentivised by her - and others - continued patronage. This transaction class can protect any addressable resource. Alice can therefore guarantee Bob that:
1. Her email to him is not spam
2. Her telephone call to him is not a robocall
3. Her posts to his website are not flamebait.
In each case this is handled by extending the protocol concerned to detect for and change behaviour depending on Alice's proof of bond.
That Alice can guarantee her behaviour to addressable resources means she can also guarantee her behaviour to non-addressable resources. She could 1. a group chat that she won't upload NSFW content
2. an IRC channel that she won't flood
3. a streamed multiplayer game that she won't swear over teamspeak.
This is accomplished by use of an addressable resource and an enforcement mechanism such as IRC's devoice command.
Alice can also guarantee her behaviour offline in much the same way. She can guarantee to:
1. a magistrate that she'll appear for trial by a given date (Bail bond/ 2. a houseowner that she'll cover costs incurred from cleaning up after her (Rental/Security deposit)
3. an innkeeper that she can pay for the drinks she's ordering (Bar tab)
That a transaction has been entered into online can be proved offline, so these can be accomplished by means of an online, addressable resource and an offline plaintext token.
Live site:
I have put up a live proof-of-concept at  This protects a specific URL accessed through HTTP (the "demo page") whereby visitors who have posted bond on testnet3 get different content than those who have not posted bond, or whose bond has expired. This is accomplished through an experimental protocol where an agent with a hot wallet speaks for a credentialed user in a similar way to how SMTP speaks for an email's original sender. That protocol would seem to be outside the scope of the proposed BIP but I'm happy to elaborate if required.
A short video demonstrating live use of the HTLB is also posted there. Name: "Hashed Time-Locked Bond" seems a reasonable name - the script is still hashed even if the digest is gone, and HTLB nicely scans like HTLC - 1.
It won't have escaped notice that the HTLB script can be wholly written in an HTLC script: 'HTLB over HTLC', however there are additional reasons to consider HTLB for a separate BIP:
1. Alternative implementations using HTLB over HTLC would need to standardise on what the redundant [HASHOP] and  should be
2. Using HTLB over HTLC is inefficient as it compels unused storage and unnecessary processing
3. Amending or superceding BIP-0199 to recognise the digest element as optional creates backward compatibility issues
4. Recognising the motivation onchain would help inform second-layer solutions where HTLB would be even more useful (eg, I believe that HTLCs and HTLBs do not have analogues in the Lightning Network)
5. Wallet support. A limiting factor for the live site above has been the lack of wallet HTLC support to the point that the demo does not implement CHECKSIG. HTLC & HTLB signing would ideally take place in the wallet that must be present, and so a BIP would help bolster the case for, and inform anyone revisiting, PR7601.
* The HTLB lives in the space somewhere near  and  The former requires an unnecessary sacrifice, the latter does not allow for penalisation.

Many thanks for your thoughts, ZmnSCPxj.
Both these are good observations and I'll act on them.
I've not read of the FTP before; I welcome it, and take on board that it improves privacy by keeping a script offline. My first thought is that doesn't affect the suggested BIP, so my next update here won't include it. I recognise it would improve mainnet use of scripts though, so do expect to return to it.

This update collects community feedback on my HTLB Pre-BIP
As reminder, I'm suggesting a BIP for a hitherto poorly supported class of transactions: "Good Behaviour Bonds".
1. On this mailing list:
ZmnSCPxj notes HTLB over HTLC can improve privacy by obscuring whether a transaction is, in fact, an HTLB or an HTLC. This requires that the 'redundant'  and [HASHOP] be not standardised. I intend to follow that 2. On Reddit at Alice's benefit. I believe he could with something like this script:
  OP_IF
    OP_DUP OP_HASH160               OP_ELSE
    OP_IF
      [HASHOP]  OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_DUP OP_HASH160     OP_ELSE
       [TIMEOUTOP] OP_DROP OP_DUP OP_HASH160     OP_ENDIF
  OP_ENDIF
  OP_EQUALVERIFY
  OP_CHECKSIG
The second OP_IF is new and would mean Bob can give Alice a [HASHOP] and  that allows her to immediately redeem the funds. I will be modifying the proof-of-concept code to investigate and prove this change.
At 3.  observes the HTLB idea is "like proof-of-stake". Such a succint comparison of HTLB with existing work is useful to me even though HTLB has nothing to do with mining and PoS consensus. I'll be investigating if the PoS penalty system has more that can inform this BIP.
I'm grateful to the above for their contributions, and also to the circa 60+ non-bot visitors to the berewic.com site: quiet interest is positive. Assuming no other major changes my next update will be a formal write-up for the BIP.
