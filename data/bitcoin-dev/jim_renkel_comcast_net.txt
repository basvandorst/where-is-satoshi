@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP Proposal: UTWFOTIB - Use Transaction Weight 
As i understand it, the transactions to be included in a block are entirely up to the miner of that block.
What prevents a miner from implementing the proposal on their own?
If this is adopted as some kind of "policy", what forces a miner to follow it?
