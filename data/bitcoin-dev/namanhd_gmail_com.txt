Hi guys,
Please check this thread
 a possible attack
Already mailed Gavin, Mike Hearn and Adam about this :
See if it makes sense.

I was talking about a DOS attack in
 (ofcourse only applicable
to entitys doing the tracking with txids).
Amazing how I did not get a response from any of the devs (except Greg's
 but
that too was short and not concerning the attack scenario plausibiity as I
replied to him).
Today they are apparently at work here
Amazing how nobody acknowledges it until later when the attack already
happens. The devs need to show some greater level of responsibility.
Don't get me wrong - I am not trying to claim credit for the attack scheme
described (though I do not know of any other place where this was mentioned
earlier as an attack scheme), but I am trying to make the point that people
should just be around and at least make others feel that their concerns are
being read. Now putting this on some place like reddit will only give the
community a bad name.
On a lighter note I messaged some of the devs (as my previous mail says)
saying the attack should be called "thenoblebot" attack (after my handle,
which would inspire me to pursue crypto studies further). It was meant to
be a lame joke. But I had no idea how it would start causing so much
disruption in the ecosystem.

Gregory Maxwell says : "Try paying a consultant if your ego demands that
you have a technical
expert to entertain your musing with immediate response."
I don't know why your resorting to such an adhominem. But I have already
said that you were the only one who responded. Your response was correct as
is reflected in the conversation on the forums. No doubting that. But it
does not address the full scope of the attack where a small pool would
intentionally (or out of whatever reason) make the hash invalid for the txs
they recieve. So that leaves a whole lot of businesses in the lurch who
have relied on txid (albeit wrongly that) for their tracking purposes.
Thats all I'm trying to say, without blaming anyone.
Hope it makes sense.

Hi guys,
I with all thats happening now I think (yea no hard proof) most of it is
being done on purpose (transaction mutation) by some pool/entity.
I have posted here  of how
to go about finding out if its some pool doing it. This does in no way
solve "fix" the malleability issue BUT IMHO it might help "alleviate" the
problem we are facing at a network level.
Please have a look if possible.
Kind Regards,

I quite agree with Peter, anything that can be exploited will be exploited,
just like malleability was.
