[resend - apologies if duplicate]
Microbitcoin is a good-sized unit, workable for everyday transaction values, with room-to-grow, and a nice relationship to satoshis as 'cents'.
But "bits" has problems as a unit name.
"Bits" will be especially problematic whenever people try to graduate from informal use to understanding the system internals - that is, when the real "bits" of key sizes, hash sizes, and storage/bandwidth needs become important. The "bit" as "binary digit" was important enough that Satoshi named the system after it; that homage gets lost if the word is muddied with a new retconned meaning that's quite different.
Some examples of possible problems:
* If "bit" equals "100 satoshis", then the natural-language unpacking of "bit-coin" is "100 satoshi coin", which runs against all prior usage.
* If people are informed that a "256-bit private key" is what ultimately controls their balances, it could prompt confusion like, "if each key has 256-bits, will I need 40 keys to hold 10,000.00 bits?"
* When people learn that there are 8 bits to a byte, they may think, "OK, my wallet holding my 80,000.00 bits will then take up 10 kilobytes".
* When people naturally extend "bit" into "kilobits" to mean "1000 bits", then the new coinage "kilobits" will mean the exact same amount (100,000 satoshi) as many have already been calling "millibits".
I believe it'd be best to pick a new made-up single-syllable word as a synonym for "microbitcoin", and I've laid out the case for "zib" as that word at .
'Zib' also lends itself to an expressive unicode symbol, '?' (Z-with-stroke), that remains distinctive even if it loses its stroke or gets case-reversed. (Comparatively, all 'b'-derived symbols for data-bits, bitcoins, or '100 satoshi bits' risk collision in contexts where subtleties of casing/stroking are lost.)

Of course people *can* manage, when they need to; natural language is full of such overloading. But the clashes are not costless, they add mental load for first-time learners and low-context users.
So the concern is, when there's a free choice, why not bootstrap words that are less fragile and context-dependent? Why add extra comprehension gotchas into what is already a challenging domain?
And it's exactly the aspect that makes 'bit' attractive ? "it's right there in the name _Bit_coin!" ? that equally presents the clash ? because the sense of 'bit' honored in the "Bitcoin" name, and central to the systems' essential properties, is the binary digit.
It's like intentionally introducing a 'false friend' word-correlation between the vernacular of the casual Bitcoin user, and the language of Bitcoin experts. And the word pair is nearly auto-antonymic in some essential dimensions: indivisible vs. divisible, base-2 vs. base-10, composed-geometrically vs. composed-arithmetically.

In naming amounts, there's no desperate need to stay in the shallow crowded pool of words just derived from "bit" and "coin". Real currencies have many names for their units, including subunits with highly-unrelated sounds. The contrasting words help create more shades of meaning for different purposes. Some examples:
  dollars/bucks - bits (1/8ths) - dimes (1/10ths) - cents (1/100ths)
  pounds/quid - shillings (1/20ths) - pence (1/100th; formerly 1/240th)
  yuan/kuai - jiao (1/10ths) - fen (1/100ths)
Regarding the cute example of contextual disambiguation...
That there are many existing definitions doesn't reassure that one *extra* definition will still be costless, especially for low-literacy/low-context/low-numeracy users or learners.
Note that this example *doesn't* showcase the new proposed '100-satoshi-value' usage, nor activate the 'binary digit' meaning. (It does activate the "part/quantity, usually small or imprecise" sense of 'bit', 7 times depending on how you classify the idioms.)
Try instead this mash of concepts, which someone deciding whether to trust 'bits' will face:
"Bitcoin uses the digital science of bits, the indivisible 1s and 0s of computer logic, to create a networked money measured in bits, which split into 100 indivisible cents called satoshis. Bit amounts are represented as 64-bit integer counts of 1/100th of a bit, so 64-bit integers can represent any balance from the smallest positive bit total, 0.01 bits (integer 1), up to a number over 92 quintillion bits (2^63-1, integer 9,223,372,036,854,775,808).
That max value won't be needed, though, because a crucial bit of the original Satoshi design is a maximum issuance of 21,000,000,000,000.00 bits (21 trillion bits, 21 terabits). These new bits are awarded to computers racing to complete a digital verification task on an algorithmic schedule: currently 25 million bits (25 megabits) arrive about every 10 minutes. That is, the total number of Bitcoin bits is increasing at 6.33 Kbps, though that arrival slows to 0 bps by around the year 2140.
The most important bit to remember is that your ability to spend bits is controlled by secret 256-bit numbers, called private keys, bits of info that only you know. The fact that these keys are 256-bits long is what makes them practically unguessable, even if someone had a computing budget of all the bits in the world, or built a computer out of all the bits in the universe. (That is, even though the network can create 25 million bits every 10 minutes, it can't guess your secret 256 bits in the lifetime of the universe!)
Watch out, though: human-chosen passwords and 4-8 word phrases typically provide much less than 128 bits of security, far too little to create a 256-bit key. And in the math of bits, having half as many bits doesn't mean half the security, it means the square-root as much security. (For a 128-bit shortfall, that's 2^128 or 340 billion billion billion billion times less strength.)
If your secret has enough bits, though, you can be confident that you can put millions of dollars into bits, because of the cryptographic power of hundreds of bits. The current value of a bit is 1/20th of a US cent, so 256 bits has the purchasing power of about 11?.
If you say you've got a bit of bitcoin in your wallet, I'll need you to be a bit more specific. If you've got one bit of bitcoin, you've got 1/20th of a cent worth, an insignificant bit. But if you've got one bitcoin, you've got about $440 worth, quite a bit! Now you know a bit about Bitcoin, where your highly-valuable bits are protected by the science of bits. Get some bits now, they're small and still cheap, what is there to lose?"
Now, most people may never need to understand binary digits and information science. But if a future of widespread cryptocurrency success comes to pass, more people than ever before will want (and need) to understand the basics, and we can help them with clear terminology.
I'd also point out to those who've built their brands around the word 'bit' that while it may seem grand to have the currency's most-common unit in your name/logo, you might wind up snake-bit. How?
*If* 'bit' is effectively bootstrapped to mean a tangible amount that people understand intuitively for everyday commerce, that amount is currently tiny (1/20th of a USD cent) and would still be tiny (10?) if bitcoin appreciates in value over 200x to USD$100K per bitcoin.
So "bitpay" starts reading as "penny-pay" ? and under an optimistic appreciation scenario might someday read as "dime-pay".
"bitsofproof" reads as "pennies-of-proof" or someday "dimes-of-proof".
