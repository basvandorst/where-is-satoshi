Many Bitcoiners have a rather unusual notion of trust.  While many state the established financial systems cannot be trusted they imply that many within the Bitcoin world need to be trusted.   There are some very irresponsible and unusual people who have authority to do things in the Bitcoin world such as manage the Wiki, the Github repository, and are given an emergency alert key.  Some of these people are only known by some sort of screen name.  If anyone questions any of these processes they are chastised and labeled a "troll".  For instance, anyone who questioned Mt. Gox back in 2013 was labeled a "buttcoiner" or something similar.  So I would say many people, including many on this list, don't fully understand the claims they are making about the "truslessness" of  >Lightning doesn't require explicit trust,
There seems to be semantic issues with describing trust and the lightning network.  You need to trust the other party during the transactions in the channel for it to work.  Yes there is way to cash out if the other party does not cooperate but that is not the same thing as saying it is trustless.  Many people are confused about this part of decentralization where the network has to take time to reach consensus.   Some people think that you can use some kind of technological trick to avoid this lag time and still have a completely trustless system.  It is a tradeoff.

When someone says something is "trustless" or "decentralized" they are really saying that it reaches some sort of "acceptable" level in their mind to "brand" it that way.

I am not "misremembering" anything.  Some people have claimed for years that Bitcoin development is "decentralized" because anyone can fork the code.  I have often pointed out to them that such a process is not decentralization similar to the process of Bitcoin mining.  It is probably closer to checks and balances you see in political systems. The response is usually that I am "troll" or that I am somehow attacking the developers by simply describing the system.  The result is that the issues and risks associated with development are often not properly evaluated.  It is the same sorts of problems you have when a central bank or Fed is controlled by a small group.  It is just human nature and Bitcoin is not immune.

Your reply seems to indicate that somehow conflicts of interest don't exist with the developers or that the developers are somehow above everyone else.  The fact is the developers on this list discuss conflicts of interest all the time as it relates to things like mining.  Conflicts of interest are going to be a regular part of Bitcoin development so you should start getting used it because it is only going to increase as the value increases.
It is your messages attacking people who raise legitimate issues that is poisonous.  It tries to prevent discussions of the risks associated with the code development.  It creates an atmosphere where people are blackballed if they discuss these issues.  This is what happens in religions all the time and it is time to start treating Bitcoin like the technology that it is rather than some cult religion.
For all I know is that a hard fork controversy is going to cause the price to drop temporarily so for all I know this is a scheme to buy some cheap coins just like when hackers used to attack exchanges and bitcointalk at the same time to get the price to drop.

The idea is to come up with some sort of standardized metric so as the tools and issues come up you are comparing similar things.
The first thing you have to do is link "centralization pressure" and (pressure to merge with a big miner) to some sort of overall decentralization metric.  For instance, how much do big miners reduce decentralization to begin with?  That is a complicated analysis on its own.  Then you can measure specif use cases with a tool like that.
the idea at least is that the metrics do not "take sides" on any issue and just provide a measure of whatever it is you are measuring.
most of the references have to do with measuring decentralization in political systems so a system would need to be developed to apply to software projects like Bitcoin:

AML-KYC is mostly something that sits on top of the Bitcoin protocol. Take Coinase, inc. as an example.  They check bank accounts before they open your account and they link your Bitcoin address to your account in their database.  Then they ask for an explanation of why you are using the account.  Then they track your coins to a certain extent once you actually buy Bitcoins.  None of these activities are directly involving the protocol or would require changes to the Bitcoin system.
What you can do is develop standards for using Bitcoin and entities that need to follow AML-KYC can choose to follow those standards if they want when they conduct business using Bitcoin.  You can add a small amount of extraneous data to transactions that could show you followed some AML-KYC procedure.  If you did that you could have a "white list" of complaint transactions rather than a "black list" of non-compliant transactions as you seem to be proposing.  I am not sure how you would actually do something like that or how it would work but it is an interesting concept (not necessarily good, but interesting).

I have been suggesting a systematic risk analysis to reduce the probability of such an attack.  If you have a systematic risk analysis then when there are issue you judge it against a standard.

He is just pointing out reality. Decentralization is really just a collection of centralized processes. If you ever want to change anything someone, somewhere has to make a decision.
Satoshi was the first dictator and he set the consensus rules for his version of Bitcoin and that is what people accepted. Those rules did not appear by magic nor did they appear via some unexplained 'consensus' mechanism. He made decisions and updated the code or accepted updates made by others.

What is immediately clear to anyone who looks at Bitcoin software development is that there is no clear process or method to make changes/updates to the software.  When I have questioned this in the past the response is usually some cultish answer about how some kind of technical consensus is reached yet nobody can point to an actual process.  If companies are expected to dedicate resources to adopt Bitcoin there needs to be some type of process spelled out that can give these entities at least minimal assurance that there is some type of process in place.  I think the whole process is based on how certain personalities handle issues but as those personalities change the system changes in unknown ways which equates to risk.
The other thing that is immediately clear is that there is no systems engineering process in place to make changes.  A "risk study" was done by the Bitcoin Foundation but that is only the first baby step in the process.  It works by defining a set of risks, likelihood, mitigations, etc.  and a risk matrix and maintaining those as living documents.   When changes are proposed alternative scenarios are created and they are measured against the baseline of what there is now.  Standard test plans are created to measure the changes against defined metrics.  It is a lot of work to define those risks to the level of detail needed for work like this.  However, the amount of time/energy saved in the end is tremendous.   Right now the process is haphazard at best with people posting random tweets, Reddit posts, blog posts, etc.  All this drama makes Bitcoin look somewhat amateurish and rather risky.
Some people also seems to conflates the notion of decentralization of the state of the ledger by mining/nodes with that of decentralization of open source software by forking the software. These are very different problems and I don't think it is possible (or even desirable) to achieve the same level of decentralization for both things.  In any case "decentralization" for the state of the blockchain is only an approximation anyway since there are things like 51% attacks and

That is what I mean by a cultish reply.  Just saying the users ultimately decide is not an adequate explanation of the situation. You are talking hard fork if someone doesn't like it.  If 10% of the users don't like there is nothing they can do unless they want to operate an altcoin.  You are not going to resolve anything by repeating these types of replies that really have no applicability in the real world.  The person who approves the pull request (no matter what the process is beforehand) is effectively the decider.
Also, as pointed out, there is no real process in place.

Do you consider that user rights should come above or below company interests in Bitcoin? FWIW on pondering that last question "should user rights come above or below company interests" I think my view of the guiding principle is starkly clear to me: that user rights should be the primary thing to optimise for. Businesses are providing service to users, their interests are secondary in so far as if they are enabled to provide better service thats good. Bitcoin is a user p2p currency, with a social contract and a strong user ethos. Importing and forcing company interests would likely be the start of a slippery slope towards an end to Bitcoin.
I always thought is was the exact opposite.  I thought it was expected that the only incentive for developers (other than increasing the value of coins they hold) is to lobby for changes that will benefit the companies that fund them.  That is the only way you are going to get more full time developers on board.  It focuses their efforts on  products and services people want rather than some sort philosophical agenda that may be unrealistic.  The notion that large numbers of volunteers will do all this work at little or no pay to improve user experience is not a realistic long term plan.  I also think it is incorrect to assume some kind of "social contract" and "strong user ethos."  While many early users are like that I think most potential users of Bitcoin don't think that way.

I have seen this question asked many times.  Most developers become defensive and they usually give a very vague 1-sentence answer when this question is asked.  It seems to be it is based on personalities rather than any kind of definable process.  To have that discussion the personalities must be separated out and answers like "such-and-such wouldn't do that" don't really do much to advance the discussion.  Also, the incentive for new developers to come in is that they will be paid by companies who want to influence the code and this should be considered (some developers take this statement as an insult when it is just a statement of the incentive process).
The other problem you are having is the lead developer does not want to be a "decider" when, in fact, he is a very significant decider.  While the users have the ultimate choice in a practical sense the chief developer is the "decider."  Now people don't want to get him upset so nobody wants to push the issue or fully define the process.  Now you are left with a broken, unwritten/unspoken process.  While this type of thing may work with a small group of developers businesses/investors looking in from the outside will see this as a risk.

I'm sorry but that is the kind of defensive, cultish response everyone gets when they ask that question.  If you had a well constructed documented process then you would be able to point to it ... but you can't.  While there are a few bits and pieces scattered  about in different places there is no coherent plan or process.
It is easy to make statements like "consensus must be unanimous" but the issue is that you never have true 100% consensus yet you have to move forward in some fashion and everyone has to run software with the same consensus rules.  The issue is how you move forward is the question that nobody wants to answer because (a) it is a hard question to answer and (b) developers see it as a threat to their authority/position.  If people just keep shutting down the discussion with a bunch of cultish stock answers then you are never going to move forward with developing some kind of process.
 From what I can see much of the discussion is personality-driven and not based on Computer Science or and defined process.  The issue is that a personality has changed so the process is perceived to be different and some people want to hard fork. Previously, the cultish answer is that Bitcoin development is decentralized because people can fork the code.  Now that some developers want to fork the code suddenly it is a big problem. Is forking the code part of the consensus process or is it the work of the devil?   The fact that there is so much diverse opinion on this shows a defined process has never been fully vetted or understood.
I have worked on these processes for many years for projects orders of magnitudes larger than Bitcoin.  I can absolutely assure you the current mishmash does not scale and huge amounts of time are wasted.  That should be readily apparent from the recent discussions and the recent concern it has caused from people outside the developer's inner circle.
Lack of defined process = high risk and wasted effort.

The more specific answer (from a user's perspective) is that there is unanimous approval within the constraints of the Bitcoin system.  The constraint is that your software must be compatible with merchants and exchanges for your coins to have value.  Stating "unanimous approval" without identifying the constraint is misstating the issue.
As for developers, the consensus on code changes are almost never 100% and someone has to make the decision about what is an a acceptable consensus.  Most of the cultish answers completely overlook this issue even though it is main point of the question.

I am not giving an opinion on the incentive process for developers.  I am just saying it exists and it needs to be taken into account when developing a process. Pretending it doesn't exist or taking it as some kind of personal insult does not do anything to advance the process.  The developer incentives feeds into the consensus process.
Depending on some kind of "rough consensus" with unstated personality-based rules of the game works fine with small projects.  As the project gets larger that does not scale as can be seen with the recent events.  That is just a taste of what will happen in the future as new issue arise.  Developers will end up spending all day tweeting and making videos instead of writing code.
The current process does not guarantee changes are approved on technical merit alone and that is part of the problem.  Since there is no defined process people make claims of all sorts of motives that may or may not exist.  The idea is to get a defined process that gives a certain level of assurance to outsiders that the process is based on things like technical merit.

These are the kind of silly responses you often get when this subject comes up.  Mr. Garzik knows how to ignore messages he doesn't want so I see no need for him to use the list to attack people he doesn't agree with and/or try to interfere with discussions of others on the list.
He turns it into a personality discussion rather than a discussion of Systems Engineering.  He also tries to intimate anyone who brings up the discussion and "punish" them as a lesson to anyone else who may raise the issue.
It is interesting that people like that are attracted to a decentralized system.   The reply is simply an attempt at protecting turf which is why Mr. Garzik's vague replies are never taken seriously on the subject of decision-making process for the software.

"Cultish" means making claims without any supporting facts.  Labeling Open Source software as being "decentralized" just because people can choose which version to run is a "cultish" claim.  Just because Bitcoin uses the mining process to come to consensus over the state of the ledger that does not mean the software versions have the same level of decentralization because users can decide which version to run. I am in the USA and I can vote in elections but I would not call the US government "decentralized."  It is a very complicated issue and cannot be explained in one or two sentences of hand-waiving arguments like you often see here.

I agree with all this.  However, as a practical matter the consensus rules are not separated out so one person decides whether the "rough consensus" has been reached and if the consensus rules should be changed.  It really has nothing to do with any personality involved or whether they do a good or bad job.  The final decision should probably not fall into the lap of one person but it does for now and that is just the way it is because there is no better way to do it if you want to get things done.
I am also not saying any specific process is good or bad, I am saying the lack of a defined process causes wasted time and effort.  Once you define the process you have now (the baseline) then you can evaluate whether parts of it are good or bad.
As the developer system transitions into a paid system where commercial entities hire developers then there is no incentive for them to do that if changes can never be made.  A defined process will give more assurance for commercial entities to bring more developers on board.

In the context of this discussion the Bitcoin Core release manager is the "decider" of what goes into the release.  Nobody said he was elected.  The discussion also has nothing to do with any specific person and nobody said anyone did anything wrong.  One of the reason why a process needs to be developed so issues are not sidetracked into a dramatized discussion over personalities which is a big waste of time.

That description makes sense.  It also makes sense to separate out the hard fork from the soft fork process.   Right now some people want to use the soft fork procedure for a hard fork simply because there is no other way to do it.
I am under the impression that most users expect changes/improvements that would require a hard fork so I think some kind of process needs to be developed.  Taking the responsibility off the shoulder of the core maintainer also makes sense.  The hard fork issue is too much of a distraction for people trying to maintain the nuts and bolts of the underlying system.
I saw a suggestion that regularly scheduled hard forks should be planned.  That seems to make sense so you would have some sort of schedule where you would have cut off dates for hard-fork BIP submissions.  That way you avoid the debates over whether there should be hard forks to what should be contained within the hard fork (if needed).  It makes sense to follow the BIP process as close as possible.  Possibly adding another step after "Dev acceptance" to include input from others such as merchants/exchanges/miners/users.  It will only be an approximation of "decentralization" and the process won't be perfect but if you want to move forward then you need some way to do it.

Without looking up specific links I am confident people like Mircea Popescu will oppose just about any change.  Maybe they don't post their objection to Github but the point I am making is that no matter what change you make someone, somewhere will be against it.  Some of the developers think that Github is the only place that matters and that the only opinions that matter is a tiny group of insiders.  I don't think that way which is the reasoning behind my statement.
I am saying that after all the concerns are addressed as far as reasonably possible someone, somewhere has to decide whether or not to commit the changes to the official release.  Right now the only person who makes that decision if the version manager.  I agree it should not fall onto the shoulders of one person who is also very busy doing other things.  I am saying there should be some process to move forward and make decisions when needed.
Also, you already saw one of the Core developers calling me a "troll" and telling others to ignore my messages.  I have heard of several people who just drop out of the github discussions because of stuff like that.  They also delete message from Gihub discussions so that archive is not 100% credible.  I have seen things like a Github discussion between 3 or 4 people and then Garzik send out a tweet that there is near universal approval for the proposed change as it nobody is allowed to question it.  After watching the github process for a couple years I simply don't trust it because the developers in charge have a dictatorial style and they shut out many stakeholders instead of soliciting their opinions.  I view the Github system as the biggest centralized choke-point in Bitcoin and probably its biggest threat to its continued survival.  Anyone can come in and hire a couple core developers and veto any change they don't want.

It is not clear he is proposing "inaction."  I am not sure what he is proposing other than being against knee-jerk reactions.  He has also said he doesn't want to take on the responsibility of deciding on whether to approve hard fork changes which is understandable considering all the other things he is doing.  Such a responsibility is probably too much of a burden to put on any one individual no matter who it is.  The next step is to come up with a process to handle proposed hard-fork changes other than just to ask the Core maintainer to do it.

It is actually not odd at all that a formal process is dismissed out of hand.  It is all about protecting turf and holding on to power.  If there is a well defined process then that takes the power out of the hands of the people who have been running the show and making up the rules.  In some cases developers see Bitcoin as their "baby" and they think they must control it in order to protect it but in doing so they can become an "overprotective parent."  Another problem is that some people in Bitcoin have disdain for the people they need such as financial, economic, security, and legal experts.  Some think they are smarter than those people because they discovered Bitcoin first and they think their knowledge of Bitcoin means they are also superior in all these other areas.  I have seen some discussions of developers who have met with people from the financial sector and they come out of the meeting with the attitude that all the experts are stupid and that Bitcoiners have everything figured out.  One developer tried to tell me that you can't do systems engineering in Bitcoin because it involves security rather than safety (of course that issue has been well vetted and NIST has a whole series of documents to address that very issue

I saw this problem first hand when Andreas Antonopolis got into a big dispute with some of the core developers over the press contacts.  The github made up their rules as they went along and simply ignored input from anyone outside their inner circle.  Since that time several people have told me they dropped out of participating in the github process.  The maintainers deleted some of my messages and I have been told I am banned form github. Further, as you can see on here Jeff Garzik, a guy who claims only to hold a few hundred Bitcoin, told people on this list to ignore my messages.  There is also the incident where Gavin lambasted someone for "hiding behind anonymity" when the whole project is based on an anonymous contributor.  I find it interesting that many developers who work on a decentralized system.  I don't like the general attitude of the developers that they are the protectors of the system and that everyone else is trying to exploit or do damage. they often characterize different users/businesses/miners as abusers, spammers, people trying to game the system, etc. while they characterize the developers as pure and good.  When the issue comes up about authority over the code (which includes the consensus rules) they spout all kinds of nonsense about how they don't have significant control and are not deciders yet they never point to who does decide.  If they weren't the deciders then people would not be spending all that time lobbying them.  just because there are some checks and balances does not mean it is "decentralized" or they are not deciders.
As for your proclamation**at Bitcoin core != Bitcoin consensus rules, that is simply not true in practice.  There is one piece of software with one maintainer.  If you want it changed you have to convince that one person to approve the change.
The core developers have the biggest influence by far to decide hard fork changes.  There is no other place to go.  While anyone can fork the code someone compare it to the river Thames.  if you don't like where the river runs you can dig a new one ... here is a spoon.  I can vote in elections but that does not mean the US government is "decentralized."  The core maintainer has decided on a hard fork change, he has decided not to do it.
In any case what happened in the past does not matter.  What is going to happen now is the question.  If nothing happens and everybody sits around saying they are not in charge of the consensus rules and nothing ever gets done I see Bitcoin just fading away into oblivion.  I am under the impression that at least some of the developers (such as Garzik) don't actually hold that many bitcoins and don't have a large stake in the system yet they have significant control.  Anyone can attack the system by simply hiring a couple core developers and creating the gridlock we see now.

So how is the level of decentralization measured?

Some of the arguments seem to make claims without providing any kind of analysis or explanation.
Nothing is truly decentralized and decentralization is just an approximation of having a collection of centralized systems interact in some way.  I would suggest coming up with some sort of metric so these discussions can start from a baseline when discussing changes.

I never said something was approved by garzik added something after it was opposed.  What I said was a proposal was made and 4 people commented on the Github.  He then tweeted there was near universal approval before most people even heard about the subject.  It was not controversial but i was pointing out the arrogance of some of the developers.  He considers the entire universe of Bitcoin stakeholders to be a very small group of insiders, not the entire universe of Bitcoin users.  Another thing I have seen on Github for bitcoin.org is how some the maintainers change the rules on the fly.  Sometimes they say a proposal had no objections so it is approved.  Other times they say a proposal has no support so it is rejected.
You are also trying to say that the core developers actually have little influence and are not "deciders" because anyone can fork the code.  That has already been discussed at length and such an argument is faulty because there is a constraint that your software is incompatible with everyone else.  The issue is that there is no way right now to change the consensus rules except to go through the core maintainer unless you get everybody on the network to switch to your fork.  People who keep repeating that the software development is "decentralized because you fork the code" without explaining the constraints are just cultists.
The discussion has nothing to do with who has the position now and I never said he has "control over the consensus rules."  The maintainer has a very large influence way beyond anyone else.  As for your claim that I want someone hurt because I am explaining the process, that is ridiculous.  If the Core maintainers did not have significant influence to change the consensus rules then everybody would not be spending all this time lobbying them to have them changed.
The outside influences and stake of the developer is a relevant topic.  The same types of things are discussed on this list all the time in the context of miners, users, merchants, and exchanges.  Again, the developers try to place themselves on some kind of pedestal where they are the protectors and pure and everyone else (miners, users, merchants) are abusers, spammers, attackers, scammers, cheaters, etc.  It is Garzik who voluntarily made an issue of how many bitcoins he holds and he made that issue in the same place where he announces many of the technical issues.  It is very relevant that he has a minimal stake in Bitcoin holdings yet he goes around making major decisions about Bitcoin and trying to dictate who is allowed to participate in discussions.  If a core developer has minimal stake in Bitcoin yet has major veto power over code change that is a problem.
You are correct that you cannot give power to any person over the Internet which is why some kind of process needs to be developed that does not involve trying to convince one person to make the changes or a system that depends on unwritten, ever-changing rules maintained by a handful of people.

The core maintainer has always been in control of the consensus rules.  Satoshi came up with the rules and put them in there.  Since then any changes to any part of the code go through the core maintainer.  It looks to me as if people are saying it somehow changed along the way because they don't want to hurt people's feeling, upset up, get them to quit, etc. Sure there are checks and balances and people don't have to use the main code base but if they change the consensus rules they are The notion that because people can download different rules and run them is interesting from a theoretical perspective but that is constrained by the network effect.  I can say the US government is not the "decider" of laws because I can vote them out, recall them, challenge things in court, or secede and start my own country.  You can also say the judge/jury in a criminal court case is not a "decider" because the president can always issue a pardon.  But those points are generally not useful in a practical sense.
The issue about the developers is the tremendous influence they have to veto any changes.  I don't have veto power yet I have more bitcoins than garzik says he has.  The whole Bitcoin software development system is subject to attack from just a couple of people who have this veto power.  With all the crying and moaning about centralization on this list I would think that would be a concern.

I really don't know who has power to do what behind the scenes.  From what i understand, if push comes to shove, it is under the ultimate control of one person who can revoke commit privileges.  Maybe I am wrong about that but the point is most people don't know for sure.
You are correct about the people having the choice to download but the influence of the official release is way beyond the influence of any forked release.  What that means in the real world is an open question and would be different depending upon the specific circumstances and difficult to predict.  It is significant power to have control over the official release at the present time.  If they did not have significant power people would not spend significant efforts lobbying them to make changes.  Any new developers hired by companies will do so because they can influence over the official release since that is the only incentive.
It seems to me that this block size fork is only the beginning of the issues that will arise over the coming years.  Whatever powers the core maintainers have it is going to be exploited one way or another as time goes on.  Maybe there are enough feedback mechanisms to protect against that, I don't really know.

So a developer who is not one of the anointed 5 is a "Core developer" because they work on Bitcoin Core.   The anointed 5 would be "Core Core Developers?"

I suggest talking to a lawyer first.  To have a license you need an entity that holds the license.  What entity actually holds the MIT license?  There is a copyright notice on the Core Client that claims the license is held by the developers.  It that the main core developers, anyone who has ever submitted an accepted pull request, or something else?  I don't think there is any kind of valid license on the software to begin with.  Just posting a notice does not make it true just like all those "terms of use" web notices are generally not valid contracts (see "click wrap vs. "browser wrap" discussions).
What entity would actually hold a "blockchain license" and who decides who would hold the license?  If the developers decide there should be a license that means the developers own the blockchain and I don't think that is consistent with what is going on here.

Like I said, you need to talk to a lawyer.  What exactly would be the purpose of any license?  How can someone be a "beneficiary" to a license when you can't even explain who holds the license to begin with?  How do they "benefit?"  I don't see any purpose to putting a license on the Core software or the blockchain because nobody can explain who actually holds the license and there is no mechanism to enforce any license and there is no revenue to be shared.  The whole discussion makes no sense.

No, the BIP makes some weird statements that don't really make sense.
Number one rule here:  To put a license on something you have to own it in the first place.
Let's say for the sake of argument that Miners own the copyright on a block they find (as pointed out something like does not normally get copyright protection but let's just pretend).  Then the miner can charge a fee for any public block explorer that wants to display the block at their web site.  They could also try to collect a fee from anyone who distributes it (like Bitcoin users using p2p to distribute the blockchain).  A copyright is about protecting revenue.  Is there some other purpose of putting a license on intellectual property?
Also, it is not up to you, or anyone else, to come up with the form of a license to control data owned by someone else.  How can you force miners   or users to use any specific license that you come up with?
There are a number of other weird statements that really don't make any kind of sense:
"In the USA, for example, these attributes confer legal protections for databases which have been ruled upon by the courts."  I have no idea what this means or what court cases you are referring to.
"The Bitcoin Core Miners" is not an identifiable entity and cannot own intellectual property rights.  What is the purpose of you putting a notice that some unidentifiable entity has some sort of rights over the blockchain data?  You are not that entity and neither are the developers.  If there are rights it is up to miners to come up with their license.
"[users] own the rights to their individual transactions through cryptograph security."  I have no idea what this means.  It is certainly not intellectual property rights of anything I am familiar with.  Once again, if the users do have intellectual rights then someone else cannot dictate the terms of the license.  They could charge a fee for miners publishing their transaction data.

That is an interesting point.  That is a feature of Bitcoin, not a bug.   If the user did have rights to sue someone then the system would not be decentralized.  User rights = someone else has a liability for violating those rights.
As it is now a user would have the right to sue all the miners, node operators, and developers collectively.  Of course that is not realistic which is the way a decentralized system should be.  If you want to try to define specific entities that have liability then they must be in control or otherwise they would not be liable.

I don't see how you can possibly conclude this effort is worth any additional time.  The legal reference is:  Feist Publications, Inc., v. Rural Telephone Service Co., 499 U.S. 340 (1991).  The court ruled that Rural's directory was nothing more than an alphabetic list of all subscribers to its service, which it was required to compile under law, and that no creative expression was involved. The fact that Rural spent considerable time and money collecting the data was irrelevant to copyright law, and Rural's copyright claim was dismissed.
If some entity puts a copyright notice, demands a license, signs software with a certificate, claims developers or miners are some legal entity, etc. then those entities are setting themselves up to be sued or prosecuted (whether legitimately or not).  There is no benefit to claiming such ownership or authority or issuing any license because nobody is going to enforce anything and they don't even have that authority anyway.  A 5-minute talk with an IP lawyer should confirm that ... but you sound like you are not going to do that.  Bitcoin certainly attracts quite a number of completely irrational people.

The first step is to define the system that is currently in place. There is a system in place but it is just close to the vest and sometimes not discussed in public.  This works when Bitcoin has a small number of stakeholder but does not work well as other parties with diverse interests get involved.  You can't expect major players to invest large sums when the process is controlled by a tiny group of people where some of those people have rather unusual opinions about things and limited experience outside of technical areas within Bitcoin.
You just don't have enough experience in working on large projects to understand the benefits of the proposal discussed.  I suggest you look into into and get some experience instead of posting rants that highlight your inexperience.  What is silly is using a process that involves hyperbolic twitter and reddit posts.
Basically such a process does not replace the analysis that is done now, it just makes it transparent and attempts to make it consistent so there is not all this confusion over comparing apples and oranges.  Here is link that discusses some of the benefits and limitations of doing this:

Governments (note the plural) are a collection of entities made up of people that do all sorts of things both good and bad.  Attaching your political agenda to Bitcoin with the hopes people will agree with it after using Bitcoin is not a viable plan to promote your agenda nor is it a plan for mass adoption.

How exactly do things set "settled" in this environment?
People looking at Bitcoin think a small group of developers and miners "control" these decisions.  Not sure if "control" is the right word but that is the perception.

Your reply has nothing to do with my comment.  It looks like you just go around posting wing nut stuff without regard to what is being discussed.   A proper threat model considers all possible threats and looks at the probability of each.
Obviously from your comment you have no experience in threat models and limited education in general.

@_date: 2015-09-20 17:24:40
@_author: Milly Bitcoin

Threat models can be developed for things like threats from governments.   The idea in developing a model is to put in the context of other possible threats.  For example, someone with a few million to burn can easily crash the exchange rate or buy a couple core developers much easier and cheaper than doing a 51% attack.  These attacks can be done by governments and non-governments alike.  The people who consider threats from government and think everyone associated with Bitcoin is somehow "pure" are irrational cultists who have no business discussing threat models in the first place.

Since nobody ever ascribed "godlike and limitless powers to a government" on this list your comment has no bearing on anything discussed here.  I am sure the whole world, except for a few underemployed gamers who discovered Bitcoin, are all untutored in history.
As for this thread, the question was how/when is a Bitcoin development issue considered "settled?"

Bitcoin will always have chokepoints governments can go after.  Hackers already targeted routers to divert mining traffic awhile back.  Bitcoin traffic is easily seen and blocked by ISP's.  It has already been pointed out that laws against merchants and exchanges cannot be defended against any other way than to have many people use the system.  (As a developer you, of course, did not mention the threat of having a tiny number of developers who have significant influence over Bitcoin.  It always amazes me the endless discussion over miners centralization and almost zero discussion of developer decentralization.)
Increasing the nodes by a factor of 2 or 3 or keeping the block size small to increase the diversity of miners by a few percent will have zero effect if those other government threats were to actually happen.

It sounds more efficient but it is not clear to me that it would change the level of centralization of how the final decisions are made.
One threat to Bintcoin involves incentive for companies to hire developers.  The only reason is to change (or not change) Bitcoin Core so it is beneficial to their interests.  I am not sure anything can be done about that risk but it needs to be understood and considered and not just ignored.
I assume that would mean fees that hike transaction fees and make Bitcoin more expensive?

That is a great suggestion.  Jerry Brito is the number one guy to go to for this information.  You will find that many early Bitcoiners are completely clueless as to the motivations of regulators.  However, you still have the problem that some influential developers know Bitcoin but otherwise are completely ignorant.  They will go around claiming everyone who discusses regulation is a "statist" and so forth.  Some people on this list actually claimed I am "statist" simply by pointing out that governments do both good and bad things and that most people trust and depend on governments to a certain extent.  That is simply a fact, it does not support any agenda.
Another example are the developers who are going around claiming a stress test is a criminal action against those running nodes.  Such a claim brings all kinds of complicated legal questions about the liability of people running nodes.  Instead of contacting someone who researched the issue (such as Peter ?urda who ended up posting several sensible replies) the developer posted some hyperbolic article on Reddit which did nothing but promote misinformation.  On top of that it makes Bitcoiners look totally ridiculous.  One day they claim Bitcoin will collapse all these government institutions and the next day they want those same government institutions to arrest people for overflowing their memory pool.
One final issue about the conference ... the developers should not be accepting advertisers engaged in nefarious activities.  In particular BicoinTalk was accepted as an advertiser.  It is well known that site has promoted fake banks where many users lost money (CoinLeders/Inputs.io), illegal investments schemes where,any people lost funds (BLBSE) and whole host of questionable, illegal, immoral, and unethical activities.  Just because the guy who runs the site wrote a block explorer that does not mean the developers should blindly promote a highly questionable web site that damages Bitcoin's reputation.  The people running these events need to start acting responsibly.

I see a number of people claiming they know what should be posted to this list but those claims appear to be without merit.
The list states the subject is "Development discussion list for Bitcoin protocol and its implementation."  That is a pretty broad description that appears to encompass a number of topics that are claimed to be "off-topic" by people who seem to be making up their own rules.  One guy even contacts people and threatens to have the list moderated if you don't follow his rules even though it appears he has no such authority and there are no official rules he can reference.
Maybe there should be a more precise description if the discussion is to be limited in some way beyond the "official" description.

You like to go around pretending you are in charge and telling people what to do.  You have no such authority and your time is probably better spent reviewing your company's Bitcoin handling and security procedures instead of trying to bully people all the time.

What happened years ago is not really relevant as Bitcoin has changed and the stakeholders have expanded.  What is relevant is the actual description.  Whatever you want to discuss it should be clearly described when people sign up.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Design Competition 
There are many people interested in starting new services and who are interested in hiring developers or at least partnering with them.  This is an important part of the ecosystem.  I have noticed both here and on Reddit that when someone proposes an idea it goes one of two ways: either there is a large amount of interest if the person is well known or liked or; the person is accused of being a spammer or made fun of if they are not well known or liked.  All this does is make the developers look like a small fickle group who actively promote Bitcoin as a an insiders' club (much like the Fed).  There should probably be a list where people can actively discuss proposed or ongoing projects and look for developers to hire.
