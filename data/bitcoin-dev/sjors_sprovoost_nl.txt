@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP-21 amendment proposal: -no125 
One way to reduce fees is to encourage usage of Replace-By-Fee, BIP 125 [0]. It allows wallets to recommend lower fees, because if a transaction gets stuck due to underestimation, the fee can easily be bumped.
Bitcoin Core has had support for RBF for a while, and as of v0.15.0 recommends lower fees [1] when the user chooses to use RBF.
I recently submitted a pull request that would turn on RBF by default, which triggered some discussion [2]. To ease the transition for merchants who are reluctant to see their customers use RBF, Matt Corallo suggested that wallets honor a no125=1 flag.
So a BIP-21 URI would look like this: bitcoin:175t...45W?amount=20.3&no125=1
When this flag is set, wallets should not use RBF, regardless of their default, unless the user explicitly overrides the merchant's preference.
Afaik adding this flag won't break existing BIP-21 support. It doesn't use the req- prefix, because it's optional. I'm also not aware of any ad hoc standards that use no125 in BIP-21-ish URIs.

I don't think all BIPs lend themselves to this pattern. Can you think of another example? I also suspect each ignored flag requires carefully defined behavior, so it's probably better to spell that out in the BIP.
I also wouldn't be surprised if this BIP will get superseded in its entirety in the not too distant future; I believe there's some earlier discussion on this list about variations on BIP-71. So I don't think there will be many additional params in the future that warrant abstraction.
Most wallets consider bech32 addresses to be invalid. This would allow merchants to display a backwards compatible P2SH address and allow modern wallets to use bech32. In fact, this should be encouraged because it's slightly cheaper for the recipient to spend these funds (but not worth even a tiny increase in shopping cart abandonment).
Once the new format has sufficient adoption, merchants can simply drop support for old wallets and not use this parameter.

I would like to see this specifically for P2SH-PWPKH and/or native SegWit bech32 addresses.
Use cases I can think of are "I'm the whale in charge of these funds, listen to me" and some form of polling.
It's nice if funds aren't excluded from these type of functionalities just because they have a complicated redeem script. So something more generic like the Elements implementation / suggestion Greg Maxwell referred to in the Github thread would be nice too.
Is it also useful or possible to sign a message proving you are able to redeem some arbitrary branch in a MAST-like tree of scripts? What about being a minority part of a multisig?
All these features have privacy trade-offs, as well as perhaps security trade-offs, e.g. when you reveal a public key that was otherwise hidden behind a hash (i.e. if someone were to break secp256k1, they'd first organize a popular poll).
There's no BIP for the current message signing mechanism either afaik.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP Proposal: Utilization of bits denomination 
As much as I love SI standards, "trains users to understand SI prefixes, allowing them to
easily migrate from one prefix to the next" seems unrealistic. The metric system is about to
have its 220th birthday and people in the US still don't use it.
It makes sense to embrace terms that stick. "bits" as a formal-yet-informal alias for ?BTC makes sense to me, unless someone can point to another term that's already commonly used.
I'm not too worried about the word bit having other meanings in common language. The word "bit coin" was introduced in the English language without a problem. A "bit" being 1 millionth of a "bit coin" doesn't seem too difficult. It will give a while new meaning to the expression "a bit expensive" :-)
Rather than nano-bitcoin, I would suggest milli bits.
It's rather unfortunate that 1 satoshi was defined as 10^-8 BTC instead of 10^-9. We could redefine satoshi to 10^-9 BTC. Then we can use kilo-satoshi instead of bits. Then the next step can be satoshi, followed by millisatoshi (you never know).
The smallest amount that can be handled by bitcoin software under this redefinition would be 10 satoshi rather than 1; mostly a matter of changing some source code comments.
The only place where I've seen the unit "satoshi" used is fee estimators. I think it's still early enough that people aren't terribly attached to the numbers shown on those sites (most people express fees in fiat terms, especially when complaining). We could switch from vbytes to weight units at the same time.

Have you thought about combining this with BIP-47? You could associate payment codes with email via DNS.
It would be nice if there was a way to get rid of the announcement transaction in BIP-47 and establish a shared secret out of bound. That would simplify things, at the cost of an additional burden of storing more than an HD seed to recover a wallet that received funds this way.
Perhaps the sender can email to the recipient the information they need to retrieve the funds. The (first) transaction could have a time locked refund in it, in case the payment code is stale.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP Proposal: Crypto Open Exchange Protocol (COX) 
I think this could be quite useful, although I don?t know if it will get adopted. If any such small local exchanges want to weigh in on this proposal, that would help. Same goes for shopping cart integrators, e.g. the folks writing WooCommerce and Shopify plugins.
Consider adding some requirements around the use of SSL and certificate pinning. Can you refer to the kind of best practices Stripe and PayPal recommend? Should some additional shared-secret or cookie / macaroon based authentication be added?
Can you clarify if this integration can run in a browser, or due to security / privacy constraints must be server-to-server?
Though it?s important to remain future-proof by being flexible, leaving the above details to individual implementers is probably going to result in bad things.
What are your thoughts on rate limiting vs. privacy? Should a payment source never return the same address even if nothing is paid to it? Otherwise someone could just crawl webshops to create an inventory of payment addresses. A new address every page reload could be a DDOS vector. It also wouldn't be compatible with BIP44 because of its gap limit, although I don?t think that?s a huge problem for exchanges.
Can this be combined with an invoice mechanism similar to Lightning, e.g. where the exchange sends a pre-image to the users wallet (relayed via and retained by the web shop) upon receipt of the funds, which they can then present to the merchant in case something went wrong. Exchanges might be happy to support this protocol, but they don?t want the burden of dealing with user support requests, so having signed invoices could help with that.
I would consider a more specific name like Delegated UTXO or something. ?Exchange? suggests is more like 0X or Bisq.
Speaking of Bisq, it would be neat if merchants can rely on random peer to peer counterparties to convert to fiat, so their customer information and revenue figures aren?t in the hands of a single counter party. Obviously that?s a can of worms today, but it would be nice if the protocol was able to support that if one day someone figures out the fraud, compliance and bookkeeping stuff.
Finally, why only exchanges? It could make sense fo shopping cart software to talk to a Bitcoin wallet that?s hosted somewhere else for similar reasons. Right now the best these plugins can do is hold on to an XPUB, and I?ve even seen solutions that just send the customers coins to their own backend wallet and then forward it.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP Proposal: Crypto Open Exchange Protocol (COX) 
Just to clarify two points:
Be sure to elaborate on the difference in trust assumptions between a merchant running such an adapter on their own infrastructure vs. trusting a SAAS that sits in between the exchange and the merchants infrastructure.
In general adapters would create additional risks to think about, depending on how fine-tuned the API key permissions are. E.g. if API keys come with full permissions you don?t want to install an adaptor plugin if your shop is hosted on wordpress.com. PayPal and Stripe make sure their API keys can?t do too much damage in case the merchant shop hosting is compromised.
I didn?t mean adding Lightning support (though that would be cool), I mean adding an invoice system to your proposal that is similar to how Lightning invoices work. Right now if the customer pays and the merchant has a poorly functioning shopping cart system, which I?ve seen more often than not, the customer would have to email their transaction id to the merchant, who then needs to login to their exchange to check if that address indeed belongs to them. But a merchant shouldn?t give all their support staff such access, and support staff may not have the right training, or even permission, to assess whether a transaction is cleared (?computer says no").
So you?d want some sort of signed message as part of the protocol that says ?if this transaction ID confirms, this order ID is paid for?.   Although this specific example wouldn?t play well with RBF. So maybe ?if the confirmed balance of this address is >= X, this order ID is paid for?, but then the exchange can?t sweep it. So maybe instead you need a callback from the exchange to just tell you when it?s (expected to be) confirmed. BitPay offers merchants various risk settings for this, so that might be worth looking into.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Proposal: allocate Github issue instead of wiki page 
I often find myself wanting to leave relatively small comments on BIP's that are IMO not worth bothering this list.
By default each BIP has a wiki page for discussion, e.g. This is linked to from the Comments-URI field in the BIP.
In order to leave a comment, you have to edit the wiki page. This process seems a bit clunky.
I think it would be better to use Github issues, with one Github issue for each BIP.
One concern might be that the ease of use of Github issues would move discussion away from this list. The issue could be temporarily locked to prevent that. The issue description could contain a standard text explaining what should be discussed there and what would be more appropriate to post on the mailinglist.
Another concern might be confusing between PR's which create and update a BIP, and the discussion issue.
If people think this a good idea, would the next step be to propose a change to the process here?
Or would this be a new BIP?

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Generalised Replay Protection for Future Hard 
If I understand the proposal correctly, you can always spend coins; it's the next transaction that is replay protected.
I like the idea of specifying the fork in bech32 [0]. On the other hand, the standard already has a human readable part. Perhaps the human readable part can be used as the fork id?
Note that in your currently proposal nForkId is only in the transaction signature pre-image. It's not in the serialized transaction, so a node would just have to try to see if the signature is valid. I don't know if that's a problem.
Can you clarify what you mean with:
What's the purpose of nForkId 1?
Can you give an example of where this opt-out would be useful? Why wouldn't it be enough to just sign one transaction for each fork?
In Spoonnet, the version number is added to the SIGHASH_TYPE in the pre-image. Your solution of just adding another field seems easier, but maybe there's a downside?

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Making OP_CODESEPARATOR and FindAndDelete in 
Can you clarify what you mean by "whitelisting all blocks before the softfork block"?
The most conservative approach could be to leave the code in place until the very last non-segwit P2SH UTXO from before the soft fork block has been spent. But this would never happen if even a single private key is lost.
After making these transactions non-standard and removing the code, transactions containing these OP-codes could be considered valid (perhaps still checking the signature, etc). Some miners would still run the code and mine those transactions, but others wouldn't verify them. This is strictly less bad than losing those funds forever, but doesn't seem acceptable either.
Is there a variant of the above scenario where a miner puts up some very large deposit (e.g. 10x the size of the UTXO) if they mine such a legacy transaction, and can lose that if someone else runs the code and finds the transaction invalid?

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP159 - NODE_NETWORK_LIMITED service bits, 
I came across the proposed Bitcoin Core implementation of BIP159 [0] in this PR [1]. The goal is to allow pruned nodes to "serve a limited number of historical blocks" (as opposed to none at all).
It contains a counter-measure for peer fingerprinting. I'm trying to understand how that impacts extendibility.
This means pruned nodes can only serve the last 288 blocks:
As the blockchain keeps growing there will be ever more pruned nodes (perhaps offset by new nodes with more storage).  Although a strict improvement over todays situation, it seems a bit wasteful to have a node with 10-100 GB of storage only be able to share the most recent 288 blocks.
It would be nice if a future extension of this BIP allows more flexibility. To limit the ability to fingerprint nodes, we could limit the number of choices to e.g. 288 + 1000 * 2^n. That yields only 8 possibilities at the current chain size. A slightly better formula could take into account typical hard drive size increments, leaving enough space for the OS and other data. Node operators could opt-in to this if they think the increased fingerprint risk outweighs their desire to share archived blocks.
I can also imagine - but not implement :-) - a future scenario where nodes prune a random subset of their chain, meaning that even nodes with little storage can be of help during Initial Blockchain Download (IBD) of other nodes.
How would such extension be signaled for? Would we need a whole new version bit?
Would upgraded nodes need a new message type to communicate the chosen prune depth? Or can that information tag along some existing message?
Jonas Schnelli pointed out on the Github discussion that waiting for BIP150 would be appropriate. Can you explain how this is related? Although I can see why whitelisted peers can be exempted from the anti-fingerprinting measure, I would not want to restrict it to just those.
Some minor suggestions for improving the BIP itself:
* add link to mailinglist discussion(s) in reference section
* explain that 288 is not just the minimum limit for Bitcoin Core, but also the bulk of traffic (as I understand from earlier discussion [2])

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Address expiration times should be added to 
Perhaps outside the scope of BIP173, but what about baking it into the protocol? That way a transaction that's sent too late, simply won't get confirmed. This removes the need for refund logic or asking a customer to pay just a few extra cents. You could also disallow a second payment.
Two downsides I can think of:
* privacy, as differences in expiration policy would be visible on chain
* miners might be able to game it in their interaction with brokers
So that's 4.8 characters for hours, or 3.2 for years, plus checksum space? The shorter the better. Perhaps one or two bits can be used to specify an exponent; a large range seems more useful than high precision. For instance a merchant doesn't care if the customer pays within 10:00:00 minutes or 10:00:01 minutes and you wouldn't care if your address is valid 50 years or 50 years and 3 minutes. This point may be mute if minute level resolution is not practical.
Is this because 5 bits are one bech32 character (2^5=32) or there is another reason? And does that include the space needed for the checksum?
Hopefully one day addresses can be abstracted away, because they really aren't what people intuitively think they are, but I don't see that happen on short notice. Until then they shouldn't exhibit "surprising" behavior.
Embedding amounts in an address could confuse people when they reuse it. Wallets would e.g. have to ignore the amount value if they previously sent money, but without changing the address string displayed in the UI.
Many merchant services and exchanges use 10-15 minute expiration though. At the wallet level, all sender and recipient need to agree on is their relative time. Fallback behavior for a signer with no access to time could be to ignore the deadline.
The BIP-70 payment protocol has significant overhead and most importantly requires back and forth. Emailing a bitcoin address or printing it on an invoice is much easier, so I would expect people to keep doing that.

I does sound like there's overlap between BIP-70 and BIP-173 that should be resolved.
Perhaps any payment request can be rendered as bech32 and any bech32 address can converted to a payment request. Maybe only for a limited set of fields (address, expiration, amount). This would be a matter of agreeing how the protobuf should be serialized and deserialized. In that case the protobuf would not contain the literal bech32 address as a string, but instead it would contain the underlying data (public key / script hash, network, etc).

I've heard of that general principe, but I'm having trouble finding a good resource that describes it more precisely.
Is it a peer to peer or mempool issue? E.g a transaction might be accepted into the mempool and relayed at one point in time and suddenly become invalid before they're committed to a block? Or that a node receives a transaction, thinks it's invalid because the address already expired, but then receives an older block later which contains that transaction?
Once in a block, I don't see how it would become invalid later. But as a miner tries to find a block and updates the timestamp, they would have toss the transaction out at some point.
Another objection I can think of, is that the soft fork introducing this change would have to use a transaction type that's non-standard at the moment. This would make it difficult for a non-upgraded node to broadcast such a transaction. The recipient would have to know if the sender has upgraded before communicating an address, which sounds impractical at best.
You're right, relative time makes no sense. So it would take 5 characters to get roughly two minute resolution that lasts for 100 years.

I believe BIP39 does an excellent job at reducing the amount of bitcoin permanently lost. Stolen funds can at least in theory be retrieved at some future date.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP 39: Add language identifier strings for 
I?m not a fan of language specific word lists within the current BIP-39 standard. Very few wallets support anything other than English, which can lead to vendor lock-in and long term loss of funds if a rare non-English wallet disappears.
However, because people can memorize things better in their native tongue, supporting multiple languages seems quite useful.
I would prefer a new standard where words are mapped to integers rather than to a literal string. For each language a mapping from words to integers would be published. In addition to that, there would be a mapping from original language words to matching (in terms of integer value, not meaning) English words that people can print on an A4 paper. This would allow them to enter a mnemonic into e.g. a hardware wallet that only support English. Such lists are more likely to be around 100 years from now than some ancient piece of software.
This would not work with the current BIP-39 (duress) password, but this feature could be replaced by appending words (with or without a checksum for that addition).
A replacement for BIP-39 would be a good opportunity to produce a better English dictionary as Nic Johnson suggested a while ago:
Wallets need to be able to distinguish between the old and new standard, so un-upgraded BIP 39 wallets should consider all new mnemonics invalid. At the same time, some new wallets may not wish to support BIP39. They shouldn't be burdened with storing the old word list.
A solution is to sort the new word list such that reused words appear first. When generating a mnemonic, at least one word unique to the new list must be present. A wallet only needs to know the index of the last BIP39 overlapping word. They reject a proposed mnemonic if none of the elements use a word with a higher index.
For my above point and some related ideas, see:

I don?t know about Electrum but many wallets validate the English words, which helps in catching typos.
Hardware wallets without a full keyboard, like the Ledger Nano S, won?t even let you freely type characters; you have to select words from a list.
So although the standard technically allows what you say, if you use anything other than 12, 16 or 24 English words, you?ll have fewer wallets to choose from.
I think it?s better to come up with a new standard than trying to patch BIP-39 at this point, which is why I brought it up.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Transaction Merging (bip125 relaxation) 
I can see how merging after the fact could be more practical than appending existing transactions.
I think what Moral Agent suggested is the same as your original proposal, namely dropping rule 3. Only fee per weight unit increase from rule 4 would matter.
The minimum per WU increase could be far higher than the minimum relay fee. The few times I?ve used RBF in practice I increased the fee by at least 50%. Rule 4 could be made more strict. I don?t know what number, if any, would address concerns about relay spam?
This wouldn?t be backward compatible. Does that matter as long as there?s enough nodes that follow the new rules? Is there a punishment for relaying transactions that violate rule 3? Could a recipient using the older rules be mislead (in a way that?s worse than the fact that RBF allows the sender to replace the transaction with anything they want anyway)?
Can you elaborate on this issue?
So this would involve wallets (of users who deposit coins) cooperating with an exchange API to consolidate in-mempool transactions?
theory that if absolute fee went down, the transaction must be smaller and thus
miners could overall earn more from the additional transactions they could fit
into their block. But to do that properly requires considering whether or not
that's actually true in the particular state the mempool as a whole happens to
be in, so I ditched that idea early on for the much simpler criteria of both a
feerate and absolute fee increase.
Why would you need to consider the whole mempool? Let?s say a miner is considering to replace transaction A and B with transaction C, where C pays a higher fee per byte than both A and B. This creates space for ~ one additional transaction in the block. It seems to me the miner only needs to check that the lowest fee per weight transaction > min_fee(A,B). At least in first approximation.

The power of simplification at work, thanks Pieter!
Regarding verification: why does bytes(P) use compressed key serialization rather than the implicit Y coordinate used for signing? I understand space savings don't matter since these values don't end up on the blockchain. Is it just easier to implement or is it faster?
Regarding rationale for choosing (e,s) vs. (R,s), you say that (e,s) "avoids the difficulty of encoding a point R in the signature". But since e = H(sG - eP || m) also involves converting a point to some byte encoding in order to hash it, how much difficulty is actually avoided? Is that, like for previous question, because you could get away with compressed keys rather than implicit Y coordinates?
Regarding batch verification: "randomly generated independently for each batch of verifications" - by whom? I assume randomly picked by the verifier?
Regarding random number used for signing. The suggested (?) deterministic algorithm to derive secret key ''k'' from the private key ''d''  seems similar to RFC6979. Maybe it's useful to briefly explain the difference, as well as your rationale for not making it mandatory (presumably the same as why RFC6979 isn't mandatory although most (?) wallets use it).
* Motivation: "signatures ... These are standardized", but the "standardized" link points to the secp256k1 curve parameters, not to anything signature related afaik

eMMC storage, which low end devices often use, come in 2x increments. Running a pruned full node on 8 GB is difficult if not impossible (the UTXO set peaked at 3.5 GB in January, but a full node stores additional stuff).
However, 16 GB is only ?10 more expensive and presumably standard by the time this would be rolled out.
On AWS every GB of SSD storage avoided saves $1 per year, not end of the world stuff, but not negligible either. Outbound traffic costs $0.10 / GB (ignoring free allowance), so when uploading 200 GB per year, the 5% would offset $1 of storage cost savings.
The above seems marginal, probably not worth it unless there?s really no downside.
What I find attractive about this proposal is the ability to squeeze more out of limited RAM (typically only 1 or 2 GB on these low end devices). I?d have to test Cory?s branch to see if that actually matters in practice.
It?s also useful to distinguish benefits during initial sync from ongoing operation.

The use of HTTPS kind of forces sender and recipient to use a 3rd party service, even though this could done bilaterally. What if the payment request contained a (single-use) Onion URL an expiration date? The recipient would have to keep a hidden service up until the expiration date, though the sender could try again if there?s temporary reachability issue.
Adding a (onion) URL to the the payment request also makes gradual adoption easier, because recipients don?t need to worry if senders support this protocol.
Indeed, once the recipient adds funds, they reveal more about themselves to the sender then they would otherwise. I think that needs more elaboration.
I assume the transaction in step (1) is some sort of collateral to insure they?re not just trying to extract private information from you? However if fees are low they could still double-spend it after the recipient revealed their address, especially because the recipient has no way of RBF?ing the original (though CPFP could help). Perhaps require that the original transaction pays a fee based on the expected size of the final transaction?
Not trusting anything is obvious. :-) It?s better to explicitly state what exactly needs to be verified (amounts, destinations, inputs, etc), and maybe list a few obvious shenanigans to watch out for.
A more general concern is that the sender can?t know for sure the recipient really supports this protocol, so it should assume that whatever information it pings to some API could be used maliciously. In what ways could it be abused?

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP proposal - addrv2 message 
Concept ACK.
What exactly do you mean by "do not know about"? It could mean:
1. A new Network ID was recently introduced which an older node doesn't about.
In that case the node won't even know the address length, so it can't parse the entry.
In fact it can't parse the entire address message if a single address has an unknown format. Maybe require a single address type per ADDR2 message?
2. The Network ID doesn't match the network the node received this message on
The node should probably be agnostic about where it received this information from.
3. The node currently doesn't support a Network ID
But what does that mean? No connection? An explicitly disabled setting? A missing dependency? The operating system doesn't support it?
I think "MAY" is the correct choice for storing for (2).
For (3) I think it makes sense for nodes to store information even if they're disconnected, but not if they have a setting disabled or no driver. Though that implementation detail doesn't seem relevant to the standard.
I don't think it's a good idea to gossip information you can't at least in theory verify, but we already do that with Tor V2. It's useful to gossip information about other networks to help e.g. IPv4 nodes bootstrap Tor connections. On the other hand, that could also help an attacker link them. We could recommend that with addrv2 the node should make sure gossip messages were received on the correct interface, but that may not be practical.
That seems like a good idea.
Adding more information seems useful, though also creates more topology mapping opportunities.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Removal of reject network messages from Bitcoin 
Can you elaborate a bit on what kind of reject messages your users are getting? I assume the users wallet connects directly to the Bitcoin p2p network?
What does the wallet do when a transaction is rejected? Does it forget about it (that seems unsafe) or compose another one (with overlapping inputs)?

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] OP_CODESEPARATOR Re: BIP Proposal: The Great 
Although I'm not a fan of extra complicity, just to explore these two ideas a bit further.
What if such a transaction:
1. must have one input; and
2. must be smaller than 400 vbytes; and
3. must spend from a UTXO older than fork activation
Adding such a contextual check seems rather painful, perhaps comparable to nLockTime. Anything more specific than the above, e.g. counting the number of OP_CODESEPARATOR calls, seems like guess work.
Transaction weight currently doesn't consider OP codes, it only considers if bytes are part of the witness. Changing that to something more akin to Ethereums gas pricing sounds too complicated to even consider.
I would also like to believe that whoever went through the trouble of using OP_CODESEPARATOR reads this list.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Taproot proposal 
Hey Pieter,
I think this is a reasonable collection of changes that make sense in combination. Some initial feedback and questions.
From the BIP:
I assume Luke Dashjr referred to the above when saying:
One reason why someone would want to avoid a "everone agrees" branch, is duress (or self-discipline, or limiting powers of a trustee). In particular with respect to time-locks.
Can this "unknown discrete logarithm" be made provably unknown, so all signers are assured of this property? Bonus points if the outside world can't tell. The exact mechanism could be outside the scope of the BIP, but knowing that it's possible is useful.
Perhaps Lightning devs have an opinion on "everyone agrees" with respect to hash pre-images. I suspect there is no benefit in guaranteeing that a pre-image must be revealed or a timeout must be waited for and there's no way around that condition.
Regarding usage of Schnorr: do I understand correctly that the "everyone agrees" internal key MUST use Schnorr, and that individual branches MAY use Schnorr, but only if they're marked as tapscript spend?
Why is tapscript not mandatory?
Misc details:
In the Design section under "Merkle branches" I suggest adding bullet points with short descriptions of "various known mechanisms for implementing this". In addition to "space savings" maybe also briefly mention a few other pros and cons, like implementation complexity and privacy. And then point out which one you picked.
In the Design section, explicitly point out you're no longer using the hash of a public key (can move some explanation up from rationale section). This is a significant change, even if you have good reason to believe it's perfectly safe.
Regarding the 64 byte SHA256(tag) || SHA256(tag) 64-byte long context-specific constant: maybe add that sha-2 block size is 512 bits
"Conceptually every Taproot output corresponds to" -> some of this conceptual stuff belongs in or before the Specification section. Try briefly explaining how tagged hashes and script validation (stack) interact, before specifying them in detail. The figure (without the pseudo-code) can be helpful for that. In the figure with the merkle tree, the description says there's "3 script leaves.". So what's going on in leaf D? If it's a way to indicate an unused leaf, why is E different (or is also TapLeaf)? Maybe emphasize that "TapLeaf" tag is there so prove to all signers there's no secret conditions (the CVE-2012-2459 protection you refer to).
