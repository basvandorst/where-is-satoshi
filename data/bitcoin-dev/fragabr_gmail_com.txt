of wallet.dat easily through menu, but when he/she needs to restore
this backup, he/she must copy the file to the correct folder and
execute "bitcoin-qt -rescan".

or "Recover Wallet" where it would show a dialog asking for the backup

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Suggestion: allow receivers to pay optional 
paying fees. I don't know who sent it and I know this type of
transaction are usually rejected by miners. Take a look at it below:
was hoping that after a few days it could be included in a block, but
Blockchain.info simply removed it (I know the sender sent from a
Blockchain.info wallet, because he added a note):
chance to pay the fee when the sender didn't pay any fee. For example,
I could pay a fee of 0.0001 BTC and receive 0.00121 BTC. In the end I'd
have 0.00111 BTC. Better than nothing.
much trouble to change the protocol to allow the receiver to pay an
optional fee?
optionally "attach" some fee to the transaction, even if he/she didn't
sent the transaction, this could be solved. Bitcoin-qt could even warn
the receiver he received a transaction without fee and if he wants faster confirmation he could pay a fee.
Bitcointalk, but nobody answered.
