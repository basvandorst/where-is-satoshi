@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP Proposal: 
I would like to propose a block size algorithm based off the use of extra unneeded, unwanted data.  I?m looking to see if anyone would be able to help me find potential flaws.
This BIP proposes replacing the current static blocksize with a 2-part blocksize algorithm to decide on the blocksize balancing power between the miners and users.  I propose an easy to implement solution for reaching consensus based on a number of factors (or variables as you programmy types like to call it).
Transaction volume and buzzword usage have been growing in a heavily correlated way for the past 6 years.  If we were to base the blocksize on the usage of buzzwords, we could grow the blocksize at a reasonable rate to scale with demand.
I have outlined specifics at
