@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Proposed BIP 70 extension 
I somewhat agree with Will (but also with Mike, Jeff, and Charlie.) I
think the idea of letting consumers know advanced details about the
transaction is good and defining these with strong types is also good.
Maybe an arbitrary set of accounting line items would be more
palatable. You could have a line item for state sales tax for example,
or a cash back reward, or a merchant discount like the proposed,
whatever is applicable. It would be a list of amount / label tuples

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Allow cross-site requests of payment requests 
Would it be a terrible idea to amend BIP 70 to suggest implementors include
a "Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *" response header for their payment
request responses? I don't think this opens up any useful attack vectors.
I ask because this would make it practical for pure HTML5 web wallets to
use the payment protocol entirely in-browser. Without this I think it would
be necessary for the server hosting the wallet's HTML to fetch payment
requests on the browser's behalf. This is somewhat inelegant and has
security/resource implications for the back-end.

That's fair. From the server perspective, I'd argue that payment requests /
payments already need to be publicly accessible endpoints. Current
practical use requires support for cross-app/cross-device requests for
them. It seems like a reasonable logical extension to explicitly allow for
them to be accessed cross-site as well.
For this to be useful, someone would have to actually want to fully
I think there is still value in fetching the payment request cross-site
even if the request payload is validated by a 3rd party using a more
conventional TLS/crypto suite. Exposing x.509/RSA/ASN.1/chain verification
functionality strikes me as a useful thing browsers could easily offer but
that's another discussion entirely but sure it could be done all in JS. In
certain environments downloading a "real app" isn't possible/practical.
It certainly won't be if there is no ability :)

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Why are we bleeding nodes? 
Has there ever been serious discussion on extending the protocol to
support UDP transport? That would allow for NAT traversal and for many
more people to run effective nodes. I'm also curious if it could be
made improve block propagation time.

Awesome! I'm assuming this is it:
It would be interesting (at least to me) to take this a step further
and offer UDP as a full TCP replacement capable of STUN-assisted NAT
traversal and possibly swarmed blockchain syncs. It would require open
TCP nodes to facilitate "connection" establishment. It is obviously a
non-trivial amount of work but would be an interesting experiment.
Maybe BitTorrent's ?TP protocol could be leveraged.
