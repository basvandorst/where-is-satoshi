that does not require an annoying lookup to a global field.
A Bitcoin transaction only has a single locktime yet a PSBT may have
2) One other thing, the per input timelock also helps in detecting whether
the transaction contains a mix of block-based
timelocks and height based timelocks. Recall that such inputs can't be
spent together under the same nLocktime.
3) Finally, one last thing which I noted while implementing a generic
finalizer for Miniscript is the restriction on sighashType.
Is such a restriction necessary? If the purpose is to only suggest signer
which sighashType to use, then I think the finalizer
should not reject those. Along those lines, we can also mark with
suggestions for the type of nlockTime(block vs height) that
should be used. With such suggestions, input parties can decide which
branches in the satisfaction they should prefer and
sign with the corresponding signatures. Note that this purpose is different
from the stated purpose of
