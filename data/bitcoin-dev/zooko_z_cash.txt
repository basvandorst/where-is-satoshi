@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Time to worry about 80-bit collision attacks or 
I don't fully understand this thread, but it sounds like to me it
might be omitting consideration of multi-target attacks. For example,
Tier Nolan's attack
which seems to be the best attack on this thread, seems to start with
one specific public key of an intended victim, but if the attacker is
happy to find a collision with *any* one out of a large number of
potential victims, he gets an advantage proportional to the number of
potential victims.
So it would be wise, in addition to the kind of analysis already done
on this thread (which appears to have already settled at "Yes, we need
public keys we could eventually have in use. 2??? 2??? Or maybe be
*very* optimistic, with some added IoT [*] goodness, and budget for
Then we need to budget that many more bits of security to keep the
future attacker's chances of success low enough that the attacker will
never succeed. (Assuming that's our requirement.)

who works in this niche of cryptography as well as several other
It has some interesting philosophical musings about the "Attacker
Economist" approach. (N.B. My respect for DJB's accomplishments is
tremendous, but that doesn't mean I automatically agree with
everything he says. I haven't made up my mind what I think about this
particular philosophical argument.)

I haven't been able to find the beginning of this thread, so apologies
if I've misunderstood what this is for, but it _sounds_ like we're
re-inventing HKDF.
I'd recommend reading the paper about HKDF. It stands out among crypto
papers for having a nice clear justification for each of its design
decisions, so you can see why they did it (very slightly) differently
than the various constructions proposed up-thread.
Also, of course, it is a great idea to re-use a standard
( and widely-understood crypto
algorithm to reduce risk of both cryptographer errors and implementor
Of course, the cost of that is the you sometimes end up computing
something that is a tiny bit more complicated or inefficient than a
custom algorithm for our current use case. IMHO that's a cheap price
to pay.
