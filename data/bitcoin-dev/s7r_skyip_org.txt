The thing is, if it doesn't have the exit flag it cannot generate lots
of traffic from real good-intended clients, because it's quite hard
for clients to choose this Node as ?XIT in their path if it doesn't
have the exit flag. So the traffic comes from clients who specifically
added "ExitNode " in their torrc and only use that Tor
instance for Bitcoin. So, someone build this custom Tor node for
themselves only, for plausible den. A pool could be the cause as it
was earlier discussed here...
The thing is I cannot find this node on atlas, globe or blutmagie can
you please provide fingerprint and IP address again? So I may ignore
it on my relays and talk to some people about it?

gmaxwell - I wanted to ask you a non-expert question. Let's say I use
my bitcoin-qt on my laptop with Tor, and send some BTC or receive
some, what can my Tor exit node see / do / harm? He can alter the
content, by modifying and transmitting invalid transactions to the
network but this will have no effect on me, e.g. can't steal coins or
send them on my behalf or intercept my payments, right? It's not clear
for me what data would such a node see? Why would you spend money to
setup a spy node for this what relevant data can it give you?

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] 75%/95% threshold for transaction versions 
Would it be wise to add a consensus rule like the one we have for blocks,
(if > 75% from last 1000 blocks are version 'n' mark version 'n' as
standard for blocks and if > 95% from the last 1000 blocks are version
'n' mark previous block versions as invalid)
but for transaction versions? In simple terms, if > 75% from all the
transactions in the latest 1000 blocks are version 'n', mark all
previous transaction versions as non-standard and if > 95% from all the
transactions in the latest 1000 blocks are version 'n' mark all previous
transaction versions as invalid.
At this moment, the standard in consensus is v1, but nothing is enforced
in the network related to transaction versions.
Regarding BIP62, as it can be read here [0] it is said that it requires
v2 transactions. It is also said that transaction version 2 will be
skipped and jump directly to v3, for an even version for transactions
and blocks (?). Might as well add the rule for invalidating previous
transaction versions if the majority updates - could this break anything
or affect functionality in any way?
BIP62 adds a newer transaction version which is optional and does not
mark previous v1 as non-standard or invalid. This means bitcoin core
will treat both v1 and v2/v3 transactions as standard and relay/mine
them with the same priority, regardless of the tx version?

Hi Pieter,
Thanks for your reply. I agree. Allen has a good point in the previous
email too, so the suggestion might not fix anything and complicate things.
The problem I am trying to solve is making all transactions
non-malleable by default. I guess there is a very good reason why BIP62
will not touch v1 anyway.
I am trying to build a bitcoin contract which will relay on 3 things:
- coinjoin / txes with inputs from multiple users which are signed by
all users after they are merged together (every user is sure his coins
will not be spent without the other users to spend anything, as per
agreed contract);
- pre-signed txes with nLockTime 'n' weeks. These txes will be signed
before the inputs being spent are broadcasted/confirmed, using the txid
provided by the user before broadcasting it. Malleability hurts here.
- P2SH
In simple terms, how malleable transactions really are in the network at
this moment? Who can alter a txid without invalidating the tx? Just the
parties who sign it? The miners? Anyone in the network? This is a little
bit unclear to me.
Another thing I would like to confirm, the 3 pieces of the bitcoin
protocol mentioned above will be supported in _any_ future transaction
version or block version, regardless what changes are made or features
added to bitcoin core? The contract needs to be built and left unchanged
for a very very long period of time...

@_date: 2015-04-17 02:17:53
@_author: s7r 
@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] 75%/95% threshold for transaction versions 
Anyone can alter the txid - more details needed. The number of altered
txids in practice is not so high in order to make us believe anyone can
do it easily. It is obvious that all current bitcoin transactions are
malleable, but not by anyone and not that easy. At least I like to think so.
(tx1) and broadcast it, you can alter its txid at your will, without any
mining power and/or access to my private keys so I would end up not
recognizing my own transaction and probably my change too (if my systems
rely hardly on txid)?

Understood. That is unfortunate, but not the end of the world. If you
could please give feedback also to these last comments / questions:
How far are we at this moment from BIP62? Can an user send a
non-malleable tx now, if enforces some additional rules?
As for the security of the system, it does not fully rely on txids being
non malleable, but see this quote from my previous email:

[/END QUOTE]
Can you comment on the quote please?
So, basically transaction malleability could affect the system in the
way that a pre-signed tx which offers the insurance and which is sent to
the user before the user sends the coins (spending user's coins back to
him after a certain period of time) could be invalidated. The insurance
tx signature will still be good, but invalid overall since the input
(txid) being spent does not exist (was altered / modified). The coins
won't be stolen or lost, but a new tx needs to be signed with the
altered (new) txid, for the system to work.
So, an user creates a transaction TX1 sending the coins to the server
but does not broadcast it. Instead, he provides the txid of TX1 to the
server. Server generates another transaction TX2 which spends TX1 back
to the user, with an nLockTime. User checks and if everything ok
broadcasts TX1. In case the txid of TX1 will be altered/modified, TX2
will become invalid (since it will be spending an inexistent input), and
the server will need to re-create and sign TX2 with the new
(altered/modified) txid of TX1, as per agreed contract. Should the
server disappear after user broadcasts TX1 and before the
altered/modified txid of TX1 gets confirmed, user's coins are forever
locked. It is true that no third party can benefit from this type of
attack, only the user will result with coins locked, but it is something
which could be used by competition to make a service useless / annoying
How could I mitigate this?
Thanks you for your time and help.

Thank you all for your comments. The youtube video was indeed very
educative and nice to watch.
It's true that malleability is not the end of the world, but it is
annoying for contracts and micropayment channels, especially refunds
spending the fund tx before it is even in the blockchain, relying solely
on its txid.
BIP62 is good for preventing 3rd parties (non signers) to mutate txids,
but cannot do anything against 2nd parties (signers). I think we can
solve both by using NORMALIZEDTXID - wouldn't this be simpler and easier
to implement? Why are we talking about P3SH when we can just upgrade
P2SH to support additional OP codes? I saw that there have been talks
about a hard fork for increasing the block size, might as well take the
opportunity and fix this for good, by implementing BIP62, NORMALIZEDTXID
as well as BIP65. Couldn't all these be part of P2SH?

Interesting point of view Thomas! I agree that if we only think

Can explain why exactly do you think this? What is the problem that
you see in lightning model exactly? I am not arguing, maybe you are
right and there is a part of the lightning network proposal which I
missed, so that is why I am asking for clarification here.
Lightning doesn't require explicit trust, worst case scenario you can
end up with coins blocked until next in-chain broadcast. It depends on
each and very hub, obviously there will also be trusted, identified

Fair enough, this is what open source is all about. Good things
sometimes come out of controversial actions. I briefly read the
manifesto, saw the migration plan, it is not that greedy and in theory
it is possible to migrate safely with no (big) incidents.
What seams a little bit unfair is that only miners get to vote and
decide, and the users will have nothing to say about it. Not even
individual miners will vote, since it will be mostly only mining pools
(individual small miners will accept whatever their mining pool runs
on). There are more users than miners obviously, the miners just mine
transactions for the users, it is the users who keep the btc/usd price.
I use bitcoin heavily (not from time to time) but I don't mine - can I
vote? The way I see it I cannot, and I am not saying it is a bad thing,
but I missed the argument explaining why users don't matter and only
miners do.
The btc/usd rate is based on supply and demand, only users take part in
this. If 20% of the miners (hashing power) go away, the network will
still operate normally (lower nethash and probably difficulty) and the
btc/usd price will be the same, but if 20% of the users go away the
btc/usd price will drop -> mining will be less profitable -> miners
could be forced to quit. In other words, the users have more control
over the miners. Why ignore?

Hello Jorge, Eric,
With all this noise on the -dev mail list I had to implement application
level filters so I can treat with priority posts from certain people,
you are on that list. While I agree with your arguments, I think it is
_very_ important to highlight some things. I am neither for the
blocksize increase neither against it, because plain and simple I don't
have enough arguments to take some definitive decision on this topic.
What I am angry about is spreading FUD that a fork could kill Bitcoin
and what we are experiencing now is somehow terrible.
1. Bitcoin XT is not necessarily an attack over Bitcoin and will not
split it into 2 different coins. It is the result of an open source free
system which lacks centralization. It is just at early stage, it could
have thousands for forks (or fork attempts) during its life.
2. We have no proof that Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen are trying to do
something bad to Bitcoin. So far everything they have done is (or should
be) allowed. They have forked an open source software and implemented a
voting system for a consensus rule change - doesn't sound like they are
committing a crime here (either legally or morally). If they are
qualified enough to maintain the software, or if the decision is
technically correct or not is another story, and it should only matter
to whoever uses / wants to use -XT.
3. If Bitcoin's value can be decreased (or Bitcoin as a project killed)
just by 2 people forking the software and submitting a consensus rule to
a vote, it means Bitcoin is dead already and it should be worthless! We
can't go around and panic every time somebody forks Bitcoin and tries to
change something - this should be allowed by the nature of its license.
If tomorrow 5 more people fork 5 different software implementing the
bitcoin protocol and submit 5 different new consensus rules to a vote,
then what? We should all sell so the price will drop to 1 cent, because
it is somehow not good enough, not stable enough?
I can fork tomorrow Bitcoin Core to a Bitcoin-XYZ software which at some
block in the future spends all the longest dusted coins to me, out of
which I give away 50% to the miners (so the hashing power will have
incentive to use my fork).
Can they do it? YES
Will they do it? NO
Should the world care about this? NO
It's as simple as that. We cannot continue to panic that "Bitcoin as a
project" is at threat because somebody forked it.
4. By having a software fork and consensus rule submitted to vote we
actually prove how open Bitcoin is, and how there is lack of control
over it from all parties (developers, miners, engineers on the mail
list). This is reason to increase Bitcoin's value! It is a feature, not
a flaw!
It's very important for everyone in the ecosystem to understand:
- yes, Bitcoin is open source, even you can fork it tomorrow if you want
and you think enough users might follow you.
- no, it's not a requirement for 100% of the nodes in the network to be
running Core, or -XT or other implementation. The more we have, the better.
- yes, there is absolutely no authority in Bitcoin - this is what lead
to this dispute in the first place. This is the truly decentralized
nature of the software, not important if we have 10.000 full nodes or
1000 full nodes.
- no, Bitcoin won't split / die or whatever because of this fork.
Regardless what it happens, if XT will reach the threshold or not,
Bitcoin will go on just because it has some unique advantages and has no
competitor from some points of view.
- Bitcoin by its design has many many advantages, but also the
limitation that it relies on majority being honest / doing the right
thing! This is just the way it is, and the benefits it is offering
heavily win over this fundamental limitation.

This is exactly the point. If shouldn't matter if somebody who forks
also tries lobbying to Bitcoin companies and miners and also trying to
convince users to adopt the fork. Bitcoin should be immune to such
attacks, otherwise it is really flawed.
Think of a very unlikely but not theoretically impossible example:
The Prime Minister of X with a government controlled authority forks
Bitcoin and changes a very important consensus rule. To ensure adoption
at hashing power level, he issues an order and raises electricity cost
for the entire population with 10 cents or so, and compensates the
miners adopting his fork with free electricity to mine Bitcoin. What
better stimulator could a miner get if not this one?
This is a social problem, not a technical one. There is no code in
Bitcoin or rule in the protocol itself to defend against such a thing.
What can and will make this attack impossible?
The users (economic power) which always ultimately should win any
dispute will refuse using the coins mined by the miners adopting the
controversial fork, which means the coins they mine will be worthless.
Even if they are created with low costs / free electricity, the mined
coins will still be worthless so it won't worth it for the miners to
take this step. Better pay for electricity and win something less vs.
not paying for electricity but winning nothing.
The same with -XT, nobody should be able to affect the entire bitcoin
ecosystem regardless how many miners or bitcoin companies you can lobby.
If this is possible, then Bitcoin is not as secure as we thought.
I agree, wrongly expressed here - sorry about it. It's true that a
software fork is nothing alike a Schism hardfork. I am still optimistic
that we aren't at a Schism hardfork yet and hope we won't get there and
-XT will rejoin in following the consensus rule and stop this division.
This is something which seams very unfair to me as well. This was my
first question after the -XT release which Mike replied to here:
To be frank the arguments didn't convince me at all. I am against this
model where users will is ignored. By forcing you to stop using
something it's not what exactly I would call a way to express your will,
it is more like a force out.
Correct - but the point still stands. If 75% of the hashing power wants
to do something which you don't agree to, as an user you don't have any
real options to prevent them. Only game them as in don't use bitcoin to
decrease its value so they are mining worthless or less valuable coins -
but by this you are hitting Bitcoin as a whole and not just the miners.

Please stop with the nonsense. Bitcoin is a decentralized payment
network. It operates globally, so neither jurisdiction can apply to it
and have effects. It is the sole responsibility of all the
users/businesses involved in Bitcoin to comply with their local
regulations while using Bitcoin. Trying to somehow standardize this
compliance at the backbone network level will be impossible in the
first place, and even if it was possible it would be a _huge_ mistake.
The word 'Bitcoin' already rings a bell in most places of the world
where there is a reasonable level of technology available. It is
powerful and we should continue the work to improve it. No law
enforcement authority or govt. branch is asking more than for
users/businesses to comply with the regulations that bind to them.
Someone in Belize for example does not have same compliance requests
with someone in Germany - which is why this is not even a subject to
be discussed on bicoin-dev mailing list. It is unique/custom for each
user/business, the requirements depending on their jurisdiction.

Decentralization depends on the context and does not have a definition
in a form that it was demanded... I can confirm we have people in our
community which do understand decentralization, and quite good
actually, just there is no definition if the form demanded.
It is known that ~90% (at least of the nodes accepting incoming
connections) are running Bitcoin Core software. This does not mean
that Bitcoin is somehow less decentralized. Bitcoin Core is open
source, it has many contributors from all over the world and there are
many pull requests - most of them do get merged if you check the
commit history. It is widely used because the quality of the code is 5
stars. There are other implementations as well, they are just not
widely used. This does not mean one is not free to write his own
implementation of the Bitcoin protocol (assuming he follows the
consensus rules of the network). The biggest problem is convincing
users to adopt that implementation, which is a normal thing which
happens in general, not only related to software implementations.
The problem is there is no other implementation out there which comes
near the quality of the code in Bitcoin Core. I am actually eager to
try other implementations as well, but something serious, because
Bitcoin itself is a payment protocol not something to play with.
This is the reason why a lot of developers contribute to Bitcoin Core
rather than writing their own implementation. This only makes Bitcoin
Core stronger, better, and obviously the result is that it has
majority in the ecosystem for good reasons. If I'm experienced in a
certain segment related to software developing, I am better of in
contributing to Bitcoin Core just with the part I know instead of
writing from scratch my own implementation.

I think this would be too complicated in practice and you'd have to
defend against many other types of attacks, including but not limited to
Sybil attacks, misbehaving servers not responding to requests,
misbehaving servers not forwarding requests, you'd need some kind of
directory servers or master servers which sign and authenticate the
public server keys, otherwise someone can poison that data and provide
the clients with wrong server keys.
Secondly, you'd not use RSA for this, but rather Ed25519 which is
faster, more cpu efficient and provides better security.
Last but not least, I don't see this as a major issue and I really thin
it is not worth your time. Better work on electrum server defenses,
hardening them against DoS. After all, Electrum is a SPV based Bitcoin
wallet, so it cannot be more anonymous than Bitcoin itself, which we
already know it is pseudonymous, not anonymous and transactions can
is today, and using SPV you assume the risk of trusting the server, it's
just how SPV should work. As a pro, it gives you the ability to sync
immediately and not download the entire blockchain.
Privacy concerned people should run their own Electrum server and make
it accessible via .onion, and connect the bitcoind running on the
electrum server host only to other onion peers (onlynet=tor). We should
highlight that using Electrum with Tor cannot leak more that some
addresses belong to the same wallet, which is not the end of the world.

We could care less about you selling your bitcoins or moving to

What we care more is keeping bitcoin a successful project which offers
clear benefits to the world. I agree a fee market is good and needed,
and transactions shouldn't be free ever, but users should also be able
to transact fast and relatively cheap, as opposite to the competition,
or at least with the same costs, so people won't move to something else.
The more people use bitcoin, the more demand we have on the market for
BTC, the higher BTC/FIAT rate will be, more people will become
interested in mining and so on. Bitcoin is not a rich-only-private-club,
it's an open, global, decentralized payment network. The less people use
it... I guess you figured it out.
So we could care less that you will go away in case the fee market won't
become absurd or too expensive to use for most users. Having some
offchain solution for small transactions would be a good idea, but this
doesn't mean we should make small transactions impossible due to absurd

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Question regarding transactions with 
I don't think that a transaction with nLockTime>0 will be accepted by
nodes / relayed in the Bitcoin network, until its time expires (e.g.
nLockTime==now). This means it obviously cannot be stored in a block,
before its locktime expires. nLockTime is designed in a way that you,
need to keep it offline (not broadcast it to the network because it
won't be accepted or relayed by nodes) until the locktime expires, then
you can broadcast it and it will be mined and included in a block, like
a normal tx.
This is exactly why Peter Todd and others are working on
CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY and RELATIVE CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY - this is an
enhancement to basic nLockTime which tends to offer to users the
guarantee that if you have a transaction with nLockTime, the signer
holding the private keys used to sign it cannot sign another one, with
nLockTime 0 and broadcast it before the locktime for your tx expires.

Well, depends on your model and what you want to achieve. That would

with nLockTime. Maybe you are the one who generates the nLockTime
transaction,  but that needs to be broadcasted by the payee (your
recipient) when the locktime expires?
One way I would use nLockTime is to have the tx generated, and keep it
somewhere not related to my wallet(s) until the nLockTime expires, then
I can broadcast it to the network by /sendrawtransaction and have it
mined and included into a block.

I guess you mean Wladimir here. You are wrong, Wladimir does decide and
if you look at the commit history on github.com for bitcoin core you
will see, that he does actually decide and does it really good.
He just does not want to decide (and he really should not) on CONSENSUS
changes or protocol changes. This is totally different.
Stop the analogy with "other open source projects". This is an open
source project (the code part) but unlike any other open source projects
which can just be forked, without affecting the other users, in bitcoin
we need all the users to trust a single blockchain, so it'll have value.
If some users fork the blockchain and change consensus rules, they are
not just harming themselves, they are affecting ALL the users, since
such a thing would have strong impact over the BTC/FIAT rate, affecting
everyone in the ecosystem. There is economics involved here and human
element, things which are hard to fix via code, even if the code is
developed in open source style.
It's one thing to decide to merge some patches, improve the code, etc.
and another thing to decide for consensus rules when you literary play
with 4 billion united states dollars of other people's money. This
shouldn't be Wladimir's responsibility, it's just unfair for people to
throw this on his shoulders.
I do not under any circumstances suggest that the consensus should
remain as it is now forever. We need to improve it, but this should not
be on the maintainer. I've seen smart suggestions on this mail list
where consensus changes can be made during a long period of time,

+1 for this  Jorge.
Agreed the majority should not be able to enforce rules over the
minority. But if the majority will just leave and create an altcoin or
whatever, this will leave the remaining minority with a less value (or
even 0 value) product or service. By enforcing some rules agreed by
the majority or supermajority, the minority will be dragged along and
even so with rules they haven't signed up for, they will still have a
product or service which is worth something.
That is why we have to be very careful into deciding this.
This debate is good, there are lots of valid points from smart people
and I am happy to see there is so much interest in this project, and
regardless if the blocksize hard cap will be changed or not I do hope,
if a hardfork will happen, it will also include a smart change that
will allow future changes (requiring hardforks) simpler, with less
headache and risks involved.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Address Expiration to Prevent Reuse 
This should not be enforced by default. There are some use cases where
address re-use is justified (a donation address spread on multiple
static pages or even printed on papers/books?). For example, I offer
some services on the internet for free, and I only have a bitcoin
address for donations which is posted everywhere. Obviously this could
possibly harm privacy, but not everyone who uses bitcoin wants to keep
all transactions private. To the contrary, there are accounting cases
when you need to archive all keys, hashes of transactions and
everything (for example when using btc inside a company which is
required by law to keep accounting registries).
I know it's not recommended to use the same pubkey more than once, but
the protocol was not designed this way. Enforcing something as
described in this topic will undermine an user's rights to re-use his
addresses, if a certain situation requires it.

How will this exactly be safe against:
a) the malleability of the parent tx (2nd level malleability)
b) replays
If you strip just the scriptSig of the input(s), the txid(s) can still
be mutated (with higher probability before it gets confirmed).
If you strip both the scriptSig of the parent and the txid, nothing can
any longer be mutated but this is not safe against replays. This could
work if we were using only one scriptPubKey per tx. But this is not
enforced, and I don't think it's the proper way to do it.
Something similar can be achieved if you would use a combination of
flags from here:
But this has some issues too.
I've read your draft but didn't understand how exactly will this prevent
normal malleability as we know it, second level malleability and replays
as well as how will we do the transition into mapping the txes in the

What is wrong with the man testing some ideas on his custom branch? This
is how improvements come to life. I saw in the BIPs some really
interesting ideas and nice brainstorming which came from Peter Todd.
Now, my question, if replace by fee doesn't allow me to change the
inputs or the outputs, I can only add outputs... what can I do with this
feature? If I sent a tx and want to replace it with a higher fee one,
the higher fee one can only have maybe additional change addresses or
another payment, if the inputs suffice? Do we have any real use cases?

it will remain just on Peter's branch?

Hi Peter,
Thanks for your reply.
I know and bookmarked your branch - nice work.
So, to clarify:
- bitcoin core (official / default) 0.10.x currently has First-seen
mempool behavior
- your custom branch uses replace by fee mempool behavior which allows
an user to change anything in a tx (I guess it needs just to have at
least one same input, so it can link it to another previously signed tx
with lower fee and substitute it in the mempool, correct?).
- First Seen Safe Replace by Fee (FSF-RBF) mempool behavior which allows
an user only to add inputs and/or increase the value of outputs will be
in yet another branch, maintained by you, but not in default / official
bitcoin core?
Another thing, if FSF-RBF lets you change TXes in the manner described
above, how does the client know which tx needs to be replaced in the
mempool? Since the txid naturally changes. How does it map tx1 with tx2
(to know tx2 has a higher fee and needs to substitute tx1) if quite a
lot of params from the transaction structure can change?

For the less crypto engineering experts but highly interested in Bitcoin
and working with Bitcoin on daily basis reading the list, what would be
an easy to understand explanation about how does this solution represent
a good fix?
So, we have a hard cap of 1 MB block currently. This is not enough
because more and more people use Bitcoin and the transaction volume
increased (yeey, good news). So, rather than fixing the issue for good,
we just increase the block size hard cap to 20 MB. I will not discuss if
this causes problems or not. But what are the future plans, when the 20
MB hard cap will be reached? Increase it again? This doesn't sound like
a fix, it sounds more like pushing the can down the road. Obviously if 1
MB is not enough now, we have the reasonable suspicion that 20 MB could
not be enough in few years.
What is the explanation that 20 MB blocks will be sufficient for life
time? Is it because 'probably other solutions will appear, such as
micropayment channels and offchain transactions'?  If this is the case,
those can easily function with 1 MB blocks as well, and we should see
those in action sooner rather than later.

Problems appear in second level and third level malleability, when
Alice sends txB to Bob which spends from txA which is unconfirmed. If
txA changes txid, txB becomes useless and invalidates Alice's payment.
Looking at scriptPubKeys instead of transaction IDs doesn't help in
this context.
This is the reason why some type of contracts are not workable or not
100% safe. One can't pre-sign a refund transaction with an nLockTime
in the future: the payer will provide the funding transaction ID from
which the refund tx will spend, but if the transaction ID of the
funding transaction is affected by malleability (third party
malleability, since the signer doesn't have interest to do so) the
refund tx becomes useless.

Hash: SHA256
Hi aj,
I partially understand - can you please provide a simple Alice and Bob
example here with the exact scenario? Thanks. Why is there a need to
'delay between publishing the commitment transaction and spending the
output'? If the absolute CLTV script reached its maturity it means
something went wrong (e.g. counterparty cheated or got hit by a bus)
so what is with the delay time needed for proving that the commitment
was revoked? I assume an absolute CLTV script reaching its maturity
(nLockTime) is the proof itself that the commitment was revoked - but
maybe I'm missing something obvious, sorry if this is the case.
I agree, I see the logic here. Absolute CLTV is not necessary inferior
to RCLTV - there are use cases and use cases. For example, you can
avoid unnecessary waiting until the nLockTime expires if you use
absolute CLTV in combination with P2SH (2/2). Again, it always depends
on the use case - it might be a good solution, it might not be such a
good solution, but even absolute CLTV alone clearly fixes a lot of
things and takes smart contracts to the next level.
Indeed. I for one _need_ CLTV / RCLTV in my day to day use cases, it
would be neat to have both, but if I can only have (for the time
being) absolute CLTV so be it - it's still a lot better.

I am reading about the Lightning Network and the BIPs which need to be

solution to scale and have almost instant transactions in a peer 2
peer, distributed and trustless way. I already knows what the needed
BIPs are and what each one does, I am curios about the impact this
will have on miner fees.
If transactions happen in a big percent offchain, and they are only
broadcasted on the mainchain where funds are moved in or out of the
lightning network, this means there will be less transactions on the
mainchain -> less fees collected by the miners. What will happen when
the block reward will go away? Either the fees for the little amount
of onchain transactions will increase to unpractical levels, either
the miners will find it not profitable to keep their hardware plugged
in to mine, so will leave and the effect will be that the hashing
power of the network will decrease. Since the network's hashing power
is a security feature (it makes some attacks impossible or insanely
expensive) I think it's important to anticipate what will happen in
this scenario.

Probably yes. But probably no. Having less hashing power is not good,
and it's unrelated to scalability and decentralization, it's related
to security. Of course we could argue that the hashing power is not
super decentralized at this moment but it's unrelated to the topic.
I'd rather have less decentralized big amount of hashing power as
opposite to less hashing power.
One theory, very close to yours, is that if Bitcoin transactions
demand grows so high that we need the lightning network, there should
be plenty of on chain transactions for miners to collect fees from.
I haven't yet seen the incentives of everyone involved in lightning
network (payment channel end points, hub operators, miners, etc.) but
would it make sense to enforce a % of the fees collected by on payment
hubs to be spent as miner fees, regardless if the transactions from
that hub go on the main chain or not?

Nobody said anything about trusting the governments in the way such as
you describe.
No matter how much you want to disagree here, Mike Hearn is right on
some aspects. He only said that bitcoin needs to have larger user
base, more use cases, making it more popular and less likely to be
banned by the governments because of political reasons. He did not say
"let's trust the governments and centralize bitcoin, give them the
possibility to trace/seize/control people's bitcoins, own all the full
nodes or hashing power" or anything like this. So, I think he wants to
suggest "be smart and Play by the rules, follow your interest". The
general threat model for which we want to scale is: larger user base
(not necessarily by increasing the blocksize - just increase the
transactions per second using the best way from all points of view),
more use cases for simple people who only do basic stuff, more
popularity but all these without the possibility for some actor to
control more than he should (like a government agency). For example,
just a summary (among many others): it will always be impossible to
freeze anyone's coins, or take them without the party's consent, or
make it mandatory to tie bitcoin addresses / wallets to real world
If we think governments are the threat, it's bad. This is because they
can make bitcoin illegal, and no matter what you or I think, there
will _always_ be more people who follow the laws (even the immoral
ones) than people who don't. If it's illegal / banned in relevant
places/countries/continents, bitcoin will be useless. What good will
it be if you can only use it anonymously in a dark-web via Tor, and
you can't tell anyone you do it and can't exchange it to fiat or vice
versa? Bitcoin has to be legit, have normal use cases and be as
popular as possible. Don't think that if tomorrow some government bans
bitcoin there will be a revolution supporting freedom and free speech
and who had this terrible idea will be jailed forever - this will not
happen. What will happen is that users under that jurisdiction will
not use bitcoin any more, merchants from there will not accept bitcoin
any more and exchangers from there will disappear. If some of them
will remain to continue doing it as an outlaw, I assume their number
will be insignificant anyway. If we move towards crypto-anarchy where
we want to say "f*** the laws, f*** the government, f*** everything",
we already lost and this should not be the consensus here under any
circumstances. We, a few computer experts on this mail list using

is millions of human beings from all social classes and with various

I can clearly see some advantages for such a feature, but it's kind of
in conflict with Bitcoin's fundamental design. This design might be
problematic when it comes to hacks/thefts, but it's what gives Bitcoin
strength and make it differentiate from other currencies:
* reversal of transactions is impossible
* keep private keys private and safe. Lose them, it's like losing cash,
you can just forget about it.
* while we try hard to make 0-conf as safe as possible (if there's no
RBF flag on the transaction), we make it almost impossible or very very
expensive to reverse a confirmed transaction.
Also, we don't have a clear way to properly decide a good settlement
period length. It doesn't fix the problem any more than nLockTime fixes
it -- you can't know ahead of time when a withdraw needs to be made.
Fair enough, but even if the withdraw is made with a settlement layer,
will the user be able to spend it further immediately? Who will accept
such an input and treat it as a payment if it can be reversed during the
settlement layer? So, if you can't know ahead of time when a withdraw
needs to be made (nLockTime) how can you know ahead of time+settlement
period when a transaction needs to be declared irrevocable?
The linked page describes that merchants will never accept payments from
'vaults', and it will take 24 hours for coins to be irreversible moved
outside the 'vault'. This covers the part "is the user able to spend a
transaction with settlement layer" but it has security properties equal
to nLockTime = 24 hours - you can't benefit and use the coins
immediately and in 24 hours price might go up or down in an undesirable
way for a certain user. It however raises a lot of other questions: what
if the attacker manages to steal both the private key and vault key (we
have strong reasons to assume this can happen: if you can't keep a
private key safe, why would you be able to keep the vault key any
safer?) and starts a race with the actual user to unlock and lock back
the vault?
I think this is a wrong approach. hacks and big losses are sad, but all
the time users / exchanges are to blame for wrong implementations or
terrible security practices.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Managing block size the same way we do difficulty 
I like the idea. It is good wrt growing the max. block size
automatically without human action, but the main problem (or question)
is not how to grow this number, it is what number can the network
handle, considering both miners and users. While disk space requirements
might not be a big problem, block propagation time is. The time required
for a block to propagate in the network (or at least to all the miners)
is directly dependent of its size.  If blocks take too much time to
propagate in the network, the orphan rate will increase in unpredictable
ways. For example if the internet speed in China is worse than in
Europe, and miners in China have more than 50% of the hashing power,
blocks mined by European miners might get orphaned.
The system as described can also be gamed, by filling the network with
transactions. Miners have the monetary interest to include as many
transactions as possible in a block in order to collect the fees.
Regardless how you think about it, there has to be a maximum block size
that the network will allow as a consensus rule. Increasing it
dynamically based on transaction volume will reach a point where the
number got big enough that it broke things. Bitcoin, because its
fundamental design, can scale by using offchain solutions.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Managing block size the same way we do difficulty 
This is an incentive, if few miners agree to create a large conglomerate
that will ultimately control the network.
You miss something obvious that makes this attack actually free of cost.
Nothing will "cost them more in transaction fees". A miner can create
thousands of transactions paying to himself, and not broadcast them to
the network, but hold them and include them in the blocks he mines. The
fees are collected by him because transactions are included in a block
that he mined and the left amount is in another wallet of the same
person. Repeat this continuously to fill blocks.
Topology and bandwidth speed / hash rate of the network cannot be
controlled - if we make assumptions about these it might have terrible
Even if we take in consideration that bandwidth will only grow and disk
space will only cost less (which is not something we can safely assume,
by the way) the hard limit max. block size cannot grow to unlimited
value (even if the growth happens over time). There is also a validation
cost in time for each block, for the health of the network any node
should be able to download _and_ validate a block, before next block
gets mined.
You said in another post that a permanent solution is preferred, rather
than kicking the can down the road. I fully agree, as well as many
others reading this list, but the permanent solution doesn't necessarily
have to be increasing the max block size dynamically.
If you think about it the other way around, dynamically growing the max
block size is also kicking the can down the road ... just without having
to touch it and get dust on the boot ;)

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Managing block size the same way we do difficulty 
I disagree.
I didn't say this is impossible to detect, but it is hard to act against
it. One miner orphaning the block intentionally is very unlikely if that
miner acts rationally. It would only make sense if 51% of the hash rate
would intentionally orphan it. Otherwise the miner who intentionally
orphans a valid block, let's say block X, has to continue to mine one in
its place on top of block X-1, and by the time he finds one:
a) his block X' is rejected by other miners because they already have a
valid block X on top of which they already started to mine;
b) block X+1 was already found and broadcasted, so the miner who
orphaned X intentionally is on the shorter chain ignored by the network.
So, one miner cannot do anything about it. Even a pool cannot do
anything about it, because the loss is greater. You need 51% of the hash
rate to intentionally orphan it, and all the miners forming 51% need to
be colluding and know for sure that every one will intentionally orphan
the said block, otherwise there's a huge risk of loss for who does it.
Nobody would gamble to do this (I am not sure if gambling is the right
word, since the loss is 100% sure here). But, we are not discussing 51%
attacks because those are a different topic.

Totally agree with Peter Todd. There's absolutely no gain for Bitcoin to
willingly participate in AML/KYC. Plus this might come with strings
attached: for example when running a Tor relay in some countries if you
interfere with the traffic (censor, limit, filter, etc.) you become
responsible for it, while when you only relay anonymous traffic without
interfering or having the possibility to do so (installing certain
tools, using a modified Tor which allows you to do so, etc.) you cannot
be held responsible for the traffic.
Any kind of built-in AML/KYC tools in Bitcoin is bad, and might draw
expectations from _all_ users from authorities. Companies or individuals
who want and/or need AML/KYC can find ways and do it at their side
isolated from the entire network, and the solutions shouldn't come from
upstream. AML/KYC/ differ from country to
country and will be hard to implement in a global consensus network even
if it would be worth it.

Yes, that is correct. Currently at present moment only v2 onion services
are supported. Bitcoin Core is limited at 128 bit 'addresses' in the p2p
protocol, so it requires a rework of the p2p protocol. v3 onion services
are whole ed25519 public keys, base32 encoded with .onion at the end.
Same reason applies to I2P 'address types' as well. However, I am not an
expert in I2P and don't actually know how many bitcoin full nodes might
exist in I2P.
For the default `ADD_ONION` feature, the onion service key was
downgraded to explicitly RSA1024 (legacy, v2 onion services) to ensure
the feature still works out of the box:
If you want a Tor only full node, you are best to use v2 onion services
for now. Why do you need the bitcoin node to explicitly have a v3 onion
address? You can have a service that is accessible to the general public
as a v3 onion service, and in the back uses a bitcoin full node that
uses v2 onion service to talk to other nodes. The v2 onion service
bitcoin network is extended fairly.
You can use in the same torrc (Tor configuration file), implicitly same
Tor process/daemon simultaneously v2 and v3 onion services by setting

It's not necessarily like this. Address re-use is many times OUTSIDE the

After that, I have no control over that counterparty. If they decide to

does not mean that I don't care about those funds being lost.
This could create a lot of problems in the industry and I think it
should be avoided. Address re-use has been strongly discouraged ever
since I can remember, and all (proper) wallet implementations try as
hard as possible to enforce it, but it's not always possible. A
counterparty that decides to re-use an address, either accidentally or
not, is not under the control of the user who handed out the address in
the first place.
There are also a lot of use cases with P2SH addresses that are some
smart contracts particularly designed to be re-used multiple times over
My 2 cents are that this is not a good way to go. If you try to index
the entire blockchain until now you'll see that address re-use is more
common than we'd want it to be and there's no clear way to prevent this
from further happening without hurting the economic interests of the users.
