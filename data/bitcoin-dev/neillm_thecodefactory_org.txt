Agreed, but I don't know the full background on this.
That's true for generating new mnemonics (i.e. same entropy can
generate any combinations of words), but not for converting a mnemonic
to a seed (i.e. a specific wordlist/passphrase should always generate
the same seed).  I agree that it's true that a static wordlist is
required once people have started using BIP39 for anything real and
changing the word lists will invalidate any existing mnemonics (unless
your 'new' wordlist simply substitutes one word for another and the
index mapping is made public ... which means it's not really an
arbitrary word list).
I don't see how this can work given the BIP39 spec as it is today
(there's simply no room for a version in the bits).  I do think
versioning would be nice, but as of now, I'm in the camp that thinks
complete wallet interoperability is a bit of a myth -- so long as you
can fundamentally move into/out of wallets at will.

Ok, I see your point here, and I was referring to rebuilding from
entropy -- which as you noted is not a real world usage.  It is a
useful implementation test though and at the very least the existing
test vectors would need to be regenerated with each word list change.
I recently added BIP39 to libbitcoin and our implementation would fail
with an arbitrarily new word list because we validate the user
provided word list before converting it to a seed (i.e. we check that
the encoded entropy/checksum line up and warn the user if that's not
the case to distinguish a rubbish word list from a BIP39 mnemonic --
as referenced in the BIP).  You're correct that we could use rubbish
words, but at the moment it's not allowed there.  By removing that
validating 'restriction', I agree with you that word lists have no
need to be fixed.  But realistically, we still don't allow completely
arbitrary words to be used because I don't see the word lists changing
too often, nor implementations storing word lists of all words and
Thanks for clarifying,

Ah, ok.  I've worked with the non-BIP39 Electrum mnemonics, which have
this behaviour, but haven't tried the BIP39 support within it.

Electrum mnemonics are not based on BIP39, which is why it can do
