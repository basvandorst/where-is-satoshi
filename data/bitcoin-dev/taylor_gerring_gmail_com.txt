@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Floating fees and SPV clients 
Why should there be two classes of transactions? Where does paying a local business at a farmer?s stand lie in that realm? Transactions should work the same regardless of who is on the receiving end.
The paradigm of sending money has an explicit cost is not new... I think people are used to Western Union/PayPal and associated fees, no?  It?s okay to have a fee if it?s reasonable, so let?s inform the user what the estimated cost is to send a transaction in a reasonable amount of time.
I stayed in a hotel for the first night here here in Milan, and there was an (anticipated) surcharge for the use of credit over cash. Again, nothing new here.
Fees are only confusing because existing clients do a terrible job of presenting the information to the user. In Hive Wallet, I?m of the opinion that we should inform the user in an intuitive way to let them make an informed decision.

Most of what you mentioned is entirely culture-dependant. In the majority of North America, sales tax is calculated at the point of sale on top of the advertised price. When my local government increases sales taxes, we feel it BECAUSE we see it. Expose information in a digestible way. Just because you don?t instinctively know how to implement a UI for varying sender fees doesn?t mean that other wallets don?t.
Leave the fee structure alone. Instead, let?s concentrate on how to calculate an accurate assessment of what a reasonable fee is for reliable service and let the software shake out the rest.

Maybe bitcointalk.org would like to donate a few BTC from the 6,000 BTC "new forum" fund to sponsor hosting?

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Fees UI warning 
Providing people with a great user experience is something that Hive Wallet is enthusiastic about, so this is stuff we?re thinking about constantly. For example, how do you alert the user to abnormal activity (i.e. sending ?too much? on accident[1])? The removal of extraneous UI and functionality that can be automated is a priority, which is why we (to date) still don?t have a Preferences dialog. Smart defaults should be an important aspect of design decisions.
Thinking about stripping UI away as much as possible, consider what was done with dat.wallet[2]: no wallet file whatsoever and it doesn't even reveal the address except when explicitly necessary. For privacy?s sake, the intent should be to detect the use of an address and automatically rotate it away from the user. This minimal interaction results in maximum benefit.
Or take a look at the new Bitstamp app I?m writing for Hive[3]. How do you cram an entire trading API into a mobile-like window? Smart use of space and making intelligent event-driven decisions is often overlooked. In the linked screenshot, imagine the user actually clicks the deposit button. A ?send bitcoins" dialog is pre-populated with the deposit address and the requested amount. Copying and pasting addresses is error-prone and not user-friendly in the least.
I would urge all software developers to think about UX when developing applications. What can be automated? What can we make a best guess about? In the case of fees, we will hopefully have more control over them in the coming months, but in the meantime, consider what your application tries to accomplish and how it can do that without getting in the way too much. Software should enable the user, not encumber them.
Lastly, I?ll leave everyone with an approach we?re considering once floating fees are feasible[4], something Mike Hearn asked about in a previous thread.

I?m inclined to agree, as this was discussed on multiple occasions and seems to fix a lot of the address re-use problems. With hot topics like ?coin validation?, I think it?s important to highlight the privacy that generating fresh addresses from public extended keys grants us.
Also thinking about implications regarding non-merchant use of Payment Protocol, encouraging the exchange of extended public keys instead of a single address could be a boon for Payment Protocol to actually be useful for users. Initially, the idea was that the merchant would generate a new address from an extended key and include that in the Payment Request. How do we handle pushing the extended public key down to the wallet itself? Do we just shoehorn the exchange of keys into the Payment Protocol itself via a special tag or would this require more substantive change? Services could develop to facilitate the exchange (acting as a sort of ?PP gateway?) or wallet software might be able to directly communicate, perhaps by exchanging PGP-encrypted files in Payment Protocol format via Bluetooth, AirDrop, email, BitMessage, or whatever future communications channel comes into being. Thanks again to Peter for putting together a consolidated list of topics!

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Extending the Payment Protocol with vCards 
Hi everyone,
I made a post on the BitcoinTalk forums  outlining how the Payment Protocol could be extended with optional vCard support to increase the usability of Payment Protocol for user-to-user transactions and improve the user experience in wallets supporting PP.
I?ve outlined the concept in as much detail as my feeble brain can handle, drawing on BIP 0070 itself and Mike Hearn?s Payment Protocol FAQ. I know there is interest in ?contact exchange? functionality from the Hive team, so I?m hoping this will begin a discussion on how we can make wallets more friendly in a standard way.
Please read, digest, and let me know if you have any feedback.
