@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] CI Build for Bitcoin - Some Basic Questions about 
Hi Folks.
I'm trying my hand at creating a reproducible build of my own for bitcoin
and bitcoin-XT, using TeamCity.
I believe it is the best way to learn something: To try to build it
Here is what I think I know so far, and I would love corrections, plus
   1. Bitcoin is built continuously on travis-CI at
      2.  there are many flavors that are built, but I'm not sure if all of
   them are actually used/necessary. are they all needed, or just to "just in
   case"?
   3.  There is a gitian build file for bitcoin, but is anyone actually
   using it? are the bin files on bitcoin.org taken from that? or the
   travis ci builds? or some other place?
   4. Are there any things that people would love to have in the build that
   do not exist there today? perhaps I can help with that?
Here is what I have now: It does not do the matrix build yet, but it's coming. I'm just wondering if
all the platforms need to be supported,and if gitian is truly required to
be used, or used in parallel, or at all..
Feedback appreciated.

Thanks Mark.
Is there a public server where the gitian builds can be viewed?
Is there a public server that shows the quorum verifications or that shows
how to join in on the verification if such as thing is helpful?

So who physically manually uploads the gitian build to bitcoin.org?

Hi All
As part of trying to learn more about the bitcoin builds, I am trying to
recreate the travis CI build system using TeamCity.
Some of the builds work fine, but the windows builds seem to be having a
problem with getting mingw dev:
[08:31:21][Step 3/3] E: Package 'mingw-w64-dev' has no installation
I'm using the same exports env vars as the travis script, and actually
using the travis script inside teamcity , incuding adding the PPA for the
mingw packages.
The PPA seems to be importing fine during the build:
[Step 3/3] gpg: keyring `/tmp/tmp_nolyfrh/secring.gpg' created
[08:30:48][Step 3/3] gpg: keyring `/tmp/tmp_nolyfrh/pubring.gpg' created
[08:30:48][Step 3/3] gpg: requesting key F9CB8DB0 from hkp server
[08:30:48][Step 3/3] gpg: /tmp/tmp_nolyfrh/trustdb.gpg: trustdb created
[08:30:48][Step 3/3] gpg: key F9CB8DB0: public key "Launchpad PPA for
Ubuntu Wine Team" imported
[08:30:48][Step 3/3] gpg: no ultimately trusted keys found
[08:30:48][Step 3/3] gpg: Total number processed: 1
[08:30:48][Step 3/3] gpg: imported: 1 (RSA: 1)
Any ideas why this seems to be working on travis and not on the teamcity
build agent?
The agent is running inside  docker image based on ubuntu.
The full log of the failed build can be found at :
same problem appears in win32 build.
there are the env vars:
NameValue passed to buildenv.BASE_OUTDIR%system.teamcity.build.checkoutDir%
env.BITCOIN_CONFIG--enable-gui --enable-reduce-exportsenv.BOOST_TEST_RANDOM
env.PACKAGESnsis gcc-mingw-w64-x86-64 g++-mingw-w64-x86-64
