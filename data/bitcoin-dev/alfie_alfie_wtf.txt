Hi folks,
Overall I think BIP 151 is a good idea. However unless I'm mistaken, what's to
prevent someone between peers to suppress the initial 'encinit' message during
negotiation, causing both to fallback to plaintext?
Peers should negotiate a secure channel from the outset or backout entirely
with no option of falling back. This can be indicated loudly by the daemon
listening on an entirely new port.

Are there any links to discussions on how authentication may be done?

Maybe the following paper can feed into this discussion:
  "Decentralized Anonymous Credentials" by Christina Garman, Matthew Green, Ian Miers

Passive is still better than none.
There already exists an unutilised WoT of "good" actors within the network -
miners via the coinbase transaction. Bootstrapping their own "trusted" pool of
IP addresses would be possible via the 100 bytes coinbase script.
A miner's WoT will give you this.
