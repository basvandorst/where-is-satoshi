In my personal opinion, this does make some sense to me, assuming I
understood Gavin.
I suppose it could be done with a new flag (like the P2SH flag) which
displays miner support for larger blocks. The new rules would apply when
a large majority of miners support the new rules by counting the number
of flagged blocks over a certain number of blocks on the network in a
deterministic fashion.
This way miners can continue to produce blocks which are supported by
both old and new clients. When it appears most people have migrated to
the new client, miners can start flagging support for the new rules, and
when a large majority of miners agree, the new rules would kick in for
all miners/clients running the new software. Miners could therefore glue
together the network during the migration phase until enough people have
updated to avoid severe fork scenarios. The only problem is ensuring
that miners will continue to support both networks for long enough to
enable successful migration.
And if too many people disagree to make a clean hard fork (too many
people stubbornly stick to the old rules), then it could be that the
hard fork is aborted and everyone goes back to the old rules, or quite
simply that the miners never give support for the new rules despite the
mechanism being included in the new client. In those cases it would be
as if nothing changed.
This way the hard fork would be determined by user participation as
judged by the miners.
If it is done, I can't think of a fairer way.

One thing to add is that perhaps in a future version of Bitcoin Core,
there could be an option for users to continue using the old consensus
rules, or an option to support the new rules (an option when they update
and an ability to change in the settings). Both types of user can
benefit from the software updates and choose with a single piece of
software what they support. Information for whether or not a user is
supporting the changes could be included in the version message.
Possibly this information could be incorporated into transactions also.
If they wish to support the new rules, then their client would support
larger blocks when there is majority miner consensus, otherwise their
clients will always only support the old rules.
This way the decision is not being forced upon the user in any way.
Just an idea.
