Hi all,
I know most of you have more important things to do, and not enough
time as it is, but I would really like your feedback on the testing
Bettermeans seemed ideal, it allowed for leaderless leadership with
people being able to dip in and out of what they wanted to do.
however it seems that bettermeans is in no way a finished product and
is rotting fast.
I would like to move away from bettermeans - whilst retaining the
voting and sub workstream style of working.  I would like to set
something up around MantisBT (Mantis Bug Tracker) - this is an
exceptionally versatile bit of software with plugins and interaction
with other testing products (everything from test setups and plans to
test runs and results) I would go as far as saying it is industry
standard (yeah, i know about bugzilla, etc. mantis beats them all
hands down.) obviously we would need a wiki and other software - this
is not a problem.
I am happpy to pay for the VPS' to host this stuff and set it all up.
I have quite a bit of experience with mantis and other opensource
testing stuff.
I see the testing of bitcoin to be very similar to the testing process
in the games industry.  for those that do not know how this works it
is like this:-
A company comes up with a device (xbox/ps),
They then publish a set of dos and donts for this device (TRC for sony
and TCRs for microsoft.  - I wrote quite a few of the MS TCR's for the
original xbox.)
They (ms/sony) then test your game against these rules and depending
on how many you pass/fail your game can be released or not.
I see this as mapping to bitcoin very well, the device is the
blockchain, and the TRC/TCR _tests_ are published so third party
developers can see how they fair [look at gavins recent blockchain
edge cases for an example] (ms/sony do not publish their testcases
only the requirements)
I believe that this will allow the bitcoin testing project to be able
to cope with the stable builds, bleeding edge builds and 3rd party
implementations all at the same time.
It doesnt matter what the app is, it is its interaction with the
blockchain, the safe guarding of the blockchain and compatibility with
the previous/future versions that are tested.
[for the bitcoin dev list]
A little about me:-
The below is more or less a cut and paste of some of the stuff I sent
gavin in my initial email about wanting to be in on the project.
I can back all of this up with references. I can go into more detail if
I was heavily involved with setting up the microsoft xbox european cert
I set up qa department for europes largest independant games developer
(although they are no longer)
worked for microsoft secure science designing security automation tools
setup the internal pentest for thales e-security (now TITS [Thales
Information Technology Solutions (or Trotters Independant Traders ;),
on thier datacryptors (fpga, crypto and product) - have done full test
cycles on hsm 8000, payshield 9000, dc2k and thier latest line of
military spec comms equipment.
Setup and pentested Thales and nCiphers credit control software (to
fips level 4 standard - This shit bitcoin exchanges need!! I know bank
is a dirty word in the bitcoin world, but we should be at least as
secure as them)
I currently find exploits in stuff like office, quicktime, ie, ff, etc
and sell them to companies like ZDI (3com) iDefense (verisgn) and some
pentest companies that require zero day exploits.
however I would like to ditch this and get my bitcoin related stuff
off the ground - with the BTP being top of the list.
my spelling is rubbish, and sometimes i forget to spellcheck before i
hit send. sorry about that.
any feedback would be really appreciated. please! I feel that this has
stagnated enough and I want to get my work out there and I want it to
be useful. (I lost 60 or so testcases because Kev left himself logged
into bettermeans and I added them under his account... none appeared
on the wiki, none appeared anywhere...)
There is already lots of stuff on the wiki that outlines how i see
things holding together - but you cant see who posted what because of
a bug that has appeared recently [meta info is just displayed as its
meta tag, {name} on {date} wrote.]
as apposed to Mistfpga on 30/8/2012 wrote...
so the tl;dr
1 - I want to use something other than bettermeans
2 - I can admin opensource software to do the same
3 - I want to take the voting/hiearachy style from bettermeans and
apply it to mantis and test workflow.
4 - I want to get some testing done asap.
5 - I have a full msdn and technet licence
6 - I have a vast array of machines [nearly 100 cores] that I can use
to automate testing and to test different setups.
7 - been mining for 18 months or so.
I do not belive this to be related, but I am not ashamed and feel no
stigma. I have posted this on a public forum. I suffer from fast
cycling (withing a day) type two bipolar disorder.  This has been and
is being managed very well by my meds (300mg quetiapine fumerate and
30mg mirtrazipine at night) I have been well for over a year now. [and
yes, even with these mental health problems I still hold SCE clearance]

Hi Gary,
Thanks for the response. :)
I have started all this in bettermeans, but lost a lot of work (which
I am working on how to redo - but I am on holiday at the moment, and
have restricted access to my test setups)
Here is the discussion thread I had with gavin about acceptance tests.
Here is the work I have currently done (note, it was losing all the
General Acceptance Tests and getting no response from bettermeans that
has lead me to not want to use it)
also note that the terminology I have been using is a little wrong, I
refer to release 0.7 as testnet release 0.7 - I will tidy it up. - I
did this before and it looks like it got reverted somehow.
here is the main wiki space that I have been using.
For the General Accceptance Tests, check
These are the basic acceptance tests based off the changelog
However, notice no tests are in there yet.
There is plenty more stuff on bettermeans so please go have a poke
around.  I will try to get at least a wiki setup on a vps I have
control of (in germany, and provided by CINFU and paid for with
bitcoins) and get the stuff moved over and put the tests back up.  I
can do a limited amount of testing if the release is to happen in the
next week or two, So I will focus my efforts on the installation tests
and wallet tests. Ideally I would like to get all the GAT's done.
Hopefully this fleshes things out a bit more.
Please feel free to add/edit but remember your stuff might magically
disappear, it might be better to wait for the wiki move.  I intend on
doing the wiki move today. but that might not happen.
(I have a feeling that it was me adding stuff from an account that is
not on the BTP that blew things up, just a feeling though)
I would like to keep tests informal if possible, but that kinda goes
against the purpose of the tests. this is a bit tricky to explain if
you have not had a look at bettermeans.  bettermeans kinda has its own
BIP and voting mechanism, which is quite nice and it is what I want to
emulate - this should reduce the need for vetting of tests... have a
look at what is there and see what you think.

Hi Michael,
Hang on a sec, in 45 minutes you can download the entire chain from
the genesis block?
I have been doing extensive testing in this area and would love to
know what is special about your setup (I have never had the entire
chain in under 12 hours, infact it is normally closerto 24.) I have an
extensive setup of test machines, everything from e4300 to phenom2x6
to i5's.
as an example on an amd e-450 with 4gb ram, and approx 3gb/s internet
connection it took 2 hours to sync the last 5 days.
Maybe i am missing something important...
Any additional information that you could provide to help me with
testing would be really appreciated.

Hi Michael,
from what I have noticed, bitcoin blockchain download/verfication all
happens in 1 thread.  (so multicores doesnt really help)
That said, I have never tried on an ssd.
What I do have is 6 SATA 6gbs configed as RAID0 Drives.
32gb of ram. ubuntu 64 (yeah I know), this runs upto 16 VM's
(I have 4 of these)
However I have not tried to download the blockchain on the master os,
just in virtulisation.  However, the dedicated machines that I have been
using for benchmarking the VM's against is a q6600 8gb ram sata2 hdd -
Win 7 (seems faster than slackware...) to me it has always felt like
network bandwidth was the issue.  I might instrument the bitcoin-qt exe
to only pick low ping nodes (has someone already done this?)
I guess it is time to start some benchmarking (like the gpu comparison page)
hte verification for the 5 past 5 days was negliglable. I am off on a
flight to australia tomorrrow, so I will set some breakpoints and do
some timings in a debugger.
This will all happen on an e-450 (wonderful machine!)
Thanks very much for your response. it would seem that I am 'doing it
wrong' :/
cheers mate,

They can be, it depends on how they are set up.  For reference, these
VM's used to test network stacks and file format bugs.  They do this
via debug tracing, trace into, not over.  They then dump this data in
files and it can keep up with a core2 duo laptop for file io. however
I moved to using an in ram database (4gb chunks, that then get dumped
over the network port to a db on a seperate machine)
I am not sure I have the skills to instrament this into bitcoind
I will test that when I get back :)
will do, thanks for the response. :)

Nice one, I worked in games for quite a few years. (before getting
into finance then pentesting) there are about 6 keen testers now.
maybe we should get a bitcoin-test mailing list, where we can discuss
stuff without disturbing the dev team.
Great question... for me I feel structure is the most important thing
to sort out first.  However we desperately need detailed testcases for
the release of a new version. - Not too much on the change log stuff,
more on the noddy stuff (as gavin points out below), downloading and
making sure it works on a non dev machine, make sure the wallet isnt
overwritten, etc.) doing games qa I imagine this would be an ideal
place for you to start.  I have a MSDN and TechNet licence so if you
need some reference ms virtual machines I can help you out.
However we need some testcase software.  Please check out what was
done on bettermeans for the stuff I was planning out...
It details everything from recompense and testcases. bettermeans kinda
died a death though...
check out:
Bitcoin over all-
I still have the testcases, but until we get some proper testcase
software I am loathed to publish them in a half arsed format. (they
worked well on bettermeans, then just vanished one day...) what
testcase software are you familiar with?
apart from that, what do you feel you can do for the project? how long
have you been involved in bitcoin?  It may well be worth reading up
all the dev stuff on the wiki so you can get you head around how the
bitcoin protocol is different from the daemon and qt client. What do
you think you can and will enjoy doing? What is your skill set in
regard to networking, crypto and operating systems. (not that you need
any, in any we still want and need you. :)
there really is room for you to do whatever role you want, and as
little or as much as you want - however funding is now a very tricky
issue. so much so that I am not sure I want anything to do with
it(distribution of coin based on work.). - I just paid for some logo
spec work out of my own pocket (for example).  I have some testers i
know irl who are willing to work for coin.
NOTE: This response has nothing to do with the bitcoin foundation.  I
am not a member of the foundation. I do not speak for them or even
probably with them. I am still trying to work out how much qa the
foundation should be responsible for, and/how it is supposed to work.
I think the games cert process would be ideal for this.  This however
this a discussion that probably wont have my involvement.  (personally
I believe that the foundation should publish requirements with example
code and testcases for each aspect of the reference client. (on
reference platforms - I do not expect many to agree with this though)
As a side note, what happens to the donations to the bitcoin testing
project? do they get moved over to the foundation? this question is
bigger than this email. as far as I know they are all on an address
Gavin holds. Actually I would like to be involved in any discussions
that would impact QA, does this mean I need to join the foundation or
just go lone wolf?
tbh I dont really understand foundations.  I always thought they were
just a tax dodge.
Sorry for the long message. :)
How fast is your code?
Got visibility?

I am very happy to hear this, however, your actual words are slightly
evasive. I do not expect you to be up to speed on this. Gavin started
a project called 'the bitcoin testing project' This project solicited
donations, about 80 coins last time I checked.  However these 80 odd
coins were donated to 'the bitcoin testing project' This would seem to
be an official bitcoin (both protocol and client) testing project.  I
signed up to work on this, and organise as much as i could of this.
for various reasons I did not manage to do the testing I wanted to on
0.7 i over committed myself.
Are the donations solicited for the 'bitcoin testing project) funds
going to be given to 'the foundation'?
Does the foundation support 'the bitcoin testing project'? does the
foundation have any involvement with 'the bitcoin testing project'?
Im ready to go, more or less.  Please check out the links in my
previous emails. I have over 400 testcases (8 platforms * 50 release
tests) - Also I am not sure what you mean by bless, I take it that is
a euphemism for pay?
I have tried my hardest to get bettermeans to work, but it doesnt.  It
does show quite a lot of work that I have done though. If you were to
say to me, 'steve, by monday we need end to end, requirements based
testing' It would be done. (I have already spent over 4 months on
this)  Leaderless leadership is something I am having a hard time
with, bettermeans is excellent at this.  But I have found very little
in regards to voting and polling that integrates with the project in
an effortless way like bettermeans.
I understand that the budget from the foundation is something that
needs to be worked on and organised.  I offer my services in this area
(qa only).  I would be happy to submit my cv and refs for this, if
I am now feeling frustrated and useless.  has my last 4 months of work
been for nothing? it feels like it.  I know I bang on about processes
but they are sorted, you can only attract talent like Arklan if he has
a process to follow. i feel like a broken record.
tl;dr version
1 - Will donations to the 'bitcoin testing project' as started by
gavin going to be given to the foundation?
2 - Is the work bill hees and myself going to be binned?
3 - I feel like I have the knowledge and drive to push this, but I
cant do it on my own.
4 - Is bill or I entitled to any of the cash raised for 'the bitcoin
testing project'
5 - Do I have to join the foundation to have a say in how the project
(testing) is done?
6 - sorry for being so mercenary, but am I going to receive any coin
for work I have done?
7 - It really probably is the time for a bitcoin-test list to appear.
 Is there anything I can do to make this happen?
have a look at the stuff in bettermeans.  I personally think we can go
a step further and publish guidelines (similar to RFC's and all the
tests that we would do against a ref client)
But I dont want to waste any more time on stuff that is going to be
ignored, life is short.
I accept that offer. and I really appreciate it.  I have some more
questions I would like you to ask in regards to QA. (Gavin and I
skyped about this a while ago and we didnt really come to a
resolution, weworked out the problems though ;) )
I have an exceptionally detailed qa process (based off the game
certification process) - but I have gone on about this at length in
previous messages.
I thank you for your email and your involvement with this, but do you
think we are closer to getting stuff tested? call my bluff... Not one
person has asked for login details to my proposals - and i even have a
bugzilla version now.
I need to sleep.  sorry if i rambled.
nite nite,
How fast is your code?

that is not what i was getting at, nor what i meant at all.I am sorry
it came across this way. Im a bit drunk. (yeah that old excuse) I was
only trying to make an example of the quandary that exists, in what
happens to the current donations. There are far more deserving people
who have a claim on that coin rather than I.
I have stated on more than on occasion (written in public and verbal
with gavin) that I would be willing to work for free. But I would love
to be able to ditch the day job. (however i see that more as services
than mining/testing)
rereading what i wrote yeah, fair play i can see how you read my mail
like that. it wasnt meant to :/ i feel a bit of a turnip. the tone is
not what i meant. it does read pretty mercenary.
This is a different issue. But I see why you have raised it and I
would like to address it. I personally believe you should earn
bitcoins for writing testcases, executing testcases, passing or
failing test cases. in that order (failing a testcase normally
generates a new one therefore encouraging indepth and recorded
testing.). QA should not be judged based solely on bug reports - this
is unfair and will result in race to report bugs.  I have worked on a
few projects that have tried it.
This is one reason we need workflow and testcase software, so we can
measure and compensate people for their work.
As I have stated in previous emails I should have, but for various
excuses did not manage to run a single testcase for 0.7. but I did
setup a frame work, and I know some people did do some good work on
0.7 I believe these people should be compensated from the (limited)
funds the project received... something needs to happen with those coins.
I am sorry you find my emails abstract (and therefore meaningless?)
this is a really confusing time. i dont know if i am doing right from
wrong. I am trying to lead, without leading... i have always preferred
benevolent dictator. I know a number of bitcoin businesses that are
really keen to work with the project, but I have no authority, noone
seems to. Someone should be able to say, nice one, thanks for the
vm's. maybe use $200 worth of coin to get a technet licence, that
gives 10 installs of each ms OS. slipstreaming in the service packs
means you can have whatever era pc you want (and the vps providers
will allow various configuration of vm's...) then even if you do it by
hand you can still do 6 or 7 at once...
as for bug reports, give me 1 week from now (168hrs), lets see what i
can do. (priority, protocol, daemon, qt ref?) but still process is
more important...
I still think that writing and doing testcases should get more coin
than bug reports. but from what I have read, the big bounties will be
paid by the foundation. im not sure if that is true or where i read
it. (protocol level bugs)
it feels like I am wasting peoples time,and I should get back in my
box. so I will.
contact me off list if you want to have a look at the various workflow
stuff i have done.

essentially yes - in all seriousness, I have come around to your way
of thinking, it is not worth arguing about. we end up in the same place.
:) nothing is final though. I will be opening it up to Arklan in a bit
(I have a pool match tonight so after that depending on how drunk i
get.) and to another couple of people who have emailed me off list who
would like to be involved in testing.
I have not created any new tests for the new stuff.  this is still the
noddy stuff.
It covers everything that needs to be covered for a newbe or someone
upgrading clients.
and it is in many formats the moment (from wiki to test runner) none
particularly useful (about to import into mantis, just fiddling with
the fields so it does testcases)
I have been trying to separate the tests into what can be automated,
recorded and checked by watching the video and have sanity checks
along the way (published sha and sha256 of the binaries match) -
(obviously the test is flagged to be run manually if there is any doubt)
I did take myself outside and had a little sit down and talk to
myself.  Lets not run before we can walk. I will still keep the grand
ideas, but they are on the back burner. (I got called a blue skies
thinker today, wtf is one of them? I said smiled and said thanks)
the main things we make sure we get tested right are all the GAT tests
in bettermeans.They are more protocol based and should be run against
all releases.  Lets nail that process, peer review it, retest it, then
use that as a basis for The Process. I will temper my zealousness. I
realise that I can come across as bullish or even aggressive in my
emails.  I never mean too.(unless I say I am. That is not an excuse
for my poor english language skills.)
But I still think that the people running the tests should have the
greatest say in what software is used. So once you have access to the
server and the cases feel free to install your favourite software and
see what other people think.
but we have a vague structure and workflow so it will be interesting
to see how it works out.
the git integration will be trivial.
please email me if you would like access.  I am off out in 15 mins but
I promise to have all access sorted by tomorrow.  I am only using 3
vps to show example testing and test platforms.  I would like it if we
could get a technet license with the donations so far, I use mine (and
my msdn) for work.
also check out bettermeans for the formats that I will be using.
bollocks. bollocks. bollocks
bye bye bettermeans. how we never knew ye.
Gavin, can we get a bitcoin-test mailing list please.  it would be
used for discussion of testing, tools, ideas, chatter, etc.  it would
not be a place reporting bugs... This list seems very focused and I
always feel like I am disrupting things with my emails about test.  I
dont mind admining the list. I would rather be vocal and inclusive, I
dont think the dev list is the place for that.

Hi All,
After the failure to get any real testing done for the 0.7 release (all
of which is my fault) I have decided to rejig things.
I am heavily into test driven development, and I have a strong
background in requirements management, and automation.
I want to leave bettermeans behind, maybe we might be able to keep the
voting aspect of it, and link it into mantis.
So, what I have been doing over the past few weeks is developing a
rudimentary requirements set, basic requirement tracking, tests to
prove/stress the requirements.
The next most important thing is to get release/acceptance tests done -
these primarily focus on new stuff doesnt break old (ie lose a wallet,
etc) and needs no special requirements.
To this end I have installed various opensource applications (mantis,
salomeTMF, bugzilla, etc) and am currently evaluating the best workflow
This was a much longer post, but decided against it. :)
So, what I want to know is who wants to be a part helping me out with
all this? I am finalising the workflow flow diagrams and they should be
ready for inspection soon.
Anyone interested in helping out/reviewing processes? even if it is just
some encouragement, it is all greatly appreciated.
Drop me an email if you want access to the current setup and help me
review the different software for the bitcoin workflow process.

Hi Matt,
Glad to have another ninja onboard :)
I have never heard of jenkins before.  I need to do some more digging.
is this the right thing?
Mantis on the other hand, I know exceptionally well.  I hate
duplication of work/data unless absolutely necessary.  I will check
jenkins out (just out of interest what is it actually meant to do? the
website implies framework, but not what its for)
So, currently there are 4 potential places for bugs to be reported
1 - jenkins (and unit tests)
2 - git
3 - mailing list
4 - forum (bitcointalk...)
5? - is there still the ability to add bugs via sourceforge?
Adding to this doesnt make sense.  Each one of these reporting methods
is for a different thing.  I am not seeking to replace these (or even
unify them) I am looking for software that will take testcases and bug
reports against them [and allow for test campaigns].  Mantis is so
flexible and industry standard and if the jenkins plugin works... then
we can keep things as they are until they fit into better places.
The reason I am so behind mantis as the backbone is it works with more
or less anything, and can easily modded to work with whatever people
are most comfortable with - however it is exceptionally powerful and
has had a constant stream of workflow improvements over the past few
I will check it out. I wrote a very basic script that wikified the
changelog, and linked to the changes and created wiki pages for the
testcases.  have you seen the stuff I put on bettermeans? bits keep
vanishing then re appearing.
This is the outline of the testing that I setup for 0.7
Yes, I would love to unify all build testing and testcases into one
place.  I am still on the fence as to including unit tests into this.
However I do see 3 distinct type of testcases
1 - requirements based testcases (requirements based off the current
block chain rules - these are edge cases and known interoperability
2 - Acceptance based testcases - these are testcases that should be
run for every build.  Check out the General Acceptance Tests in the
wiki link for examples and testcases
3 - Testcases for reference implementations of things (like multisig -
i see these working like the /test folder when you install a new perl
These three things alone are a massive task. and they still wont cover
everything.  I would like to get the workflow so that people can
sponsor or donate to a specific campaign (eg a new feature is
implemented, people want it tested so can donate just for that
campaign [developing testcases, structure, requirements, etc])
Once this is done, I will get to do some exciting stuff (like writing
fuzzers, automation, etc) unfortunately I do not know python, only perl.
Nice, I love testing.  I think we will get on :)
And I would rather go for interoperability between testing rather than
rewriting it all.

I think you misunderstand what I am proposing.
QA needs more than just an issue tracker. i have yet to find any
opensource software that integrates testcases, nor any method for
generating testplans, nor any method for linking testcases and plans
to requirements, that work with git.
We will need software for this (as well as workflow software) and it
is much easier to integrate this into mantis/bugzilla. They are both
so much more functional than Git.
both mantis and bugzilla have full two way functionality with git.
well 3 but okay.  Jenkins integrates both with mantis (and therefore a
testsuite, etc) and with git. I do not see why anything should be any
different.  again I am not trying to change any current process, just
develop some new ones.
You will only ever receive bug reports via git. How they are entered
should not be of concern.
There will be no space in mantis/zilla for bugs that are not related
to testcases.
I feel very strongly that developers should not do regression testing
or any signoff testing on their own code. QA should do the testing. I
am 50/50 if they should write the testcases. the QA process should
make things easier for the dev team, not generate more work for them.
All the core development team will still use git. the extra software
is needed by test.
(And the third point was coming up with a suite of tests for 3rd party
developers to test their interoperability - this will having nothing
to do with git, or mantis. But the solution should be compatible with

Hi Gavin,
Sorry for the delayed response, I wanted to take a couple of days to
reflect on your email.
And their are other methods too.
The GUI::Test package for perl will allow this to be greatly
automated. (I have done this before on the localisation of photoshop.)
this why we need detailed testscripts and plans.  so we know what has
and hasnt been done. The more boring the task the more work that needs
to go into testcase development.  This is the area I see as my
greatest failing last time.  I have a large number of virtual machines
and should have at least this work.  But we need very detailed
testcases.  with decent testplans just downloading the software,
syncing the block chain, syncing an existing wallet, rescanning the
blockchain and verifying the balance would cover a large number of
tests.  The idea behind having lots of very specific testcases is you
get to see what tests have not been run.
I understand your concern, however I have taken a couple of days to
reflect on this and I still strongly feel that in order to make sure
that this sticks, and is still useful in 1 years time we need to lay
proper foundations. Those foundations are not word documents,
spreadsheets, etc.  they are selecting the right tools for the job.
We can gain so much benefit from using 3rd party software.
(bettermeans would rock if it wasnt rotting)
I am sure you could do your coding work just using vi, but an sdk
makes it much easier and allows you to work in a more productive manner.
I have had a couple of off list emails with some testers and they also
feel that it is very important to make sure we have a sound foundation
(mantis is so much more than just a bug reporting tool, I see the bug
reporting functionality as secondary to the main test run
functionality - but it doesnt have to be mantis based, we do need
workflow and testcase software though - and proper software for this
is much better than just a massive google doc.) however I am checking
out some other software that has been recommended.  It will be very
hard to change 'the process' once we have something we are used too
(just look at the current resistance) I promise nothing will change
for the dev team.  But test does need other tools, and processes.
If you feel that strongly that I am going about this the wrong way, I
am happy to step back and let someone else sort it out (I will still
do all the testing I possibly can). I would feel that this would be a
real shame and we have the chance to setup requirements to
functionality to tests all with traceability. why not do it right from
the start?
I will open up my vps' somepoint over the next few days and you can
see what I mean. I will setup a fake git project, and sort out the

Do you mean firewalls or something like snort or other deep packet
inspection for the tcp sockets statement? I dont see much of an issue
with either.
set up your own private testnet and have a play with this
The eicar test virus.
I have tried a few ways of getting the eicar string into the blockchain
(on a private testnet) and getting it flagged by AV, however it is a bit
tricky (the getting it flagged bit). and tbh you would exclude the
bitcoin directory and runtime from antivirus scans so i stopped bothering.
I am making vague assumptions about using windows with antivirus. (and
linux for deep packet inspection, but the idea is the same whatever.)
I found no greater attack surface area (in the blockchain) than
cookies... thinking about it a bit more, there is a bit more potential
as a bounce pad/egg drop location but not much - no heap spraying as
such, or d/c tors, or heap header structs, etc. Im sure someone is sure
to come up with something very clever tho. just not me.
