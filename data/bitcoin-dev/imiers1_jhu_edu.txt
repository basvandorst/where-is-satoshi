Whats the best way to get performance numbers for modifications to bitcoin
? Profiling it while running on testnet might work, but that would take a
rather long time to get data.
Is there anyway to speed this up  if we only needed to
provide  relative performance between tests. (in a sense a fast performance
regression test).
At least in theory, one possibility would be to replay real
bitcoin transactions  to a test-net-in-a-box network (of maybe a few nodes)
that has the real blockchain history loaded into it but then operates at a
far reduced hash difficulty in order facilitate running quickly.
Are there existing techniques/scripts for  some kind of perf testing with
traffic that at least approximates real world traffic ?
The test infrastructure  that ships with bitcoin does not appear to provide

Script evaluation performance was what I was primarily concerned with.  I'm
fooling around with adding some new instruction types.
The tricky part is that to test how that effects performance, you need to
be able to intersperse transactions with the new instructions with existing
ones.  For accuracy, you'd like your simulated traffic to at least
approximate the real world traffic.
Also, is there any bench-marking / instrumentation in bitcoind ?

Agreed, you need to consider DoS attacks.  I have that in my mind under
security and not performance. I'd imagine the test methodology would be
completely different since you no longer are attempting to simulate real
world traffic.
