@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Getting trusted metrics from the block chain 
Hello all,
I'm designing a program that needs some metrics computed from the Bitcoin
block chain (some address balances, or the occurrence or not of a specific
transaction). The kind of infos you get from provided you trust this website (my program do not).
My program should run on lightweight/embedded hardware. The execution
environment provides access to the Bitcoin network but not enough resources
to set up a trusted node along with my program. Also, my program trusts the
global Bitcoin network but no individual node.
I would need a way to ask an untrusted Bitcoin node to compute some 'metric
request' on my behalf and having the result of that metric request
validated by the network.
Is there any available or work-in-progress projects that would come close
to this need ? Or should I do it myself ? :-)
Thank you all,
Cl?ment Elbaz

Some more thoughts :
If no such project exist yet, I thought it could work with an alternate,
small and fixed-length 'metric request block chain' of some sort.
It would temporarily stores structures defined as [metric request | current
block number when request was made | hash of the response] instead of
financial transactions.
These structures are verifiable so it could work the same way as a regular
financial blochchain.
It should not be part of the main Bitcoin protocol but could be a plugin
interacting with the data managed by the fullnode bitcoin software.
Also, metrics requests can be expensive to compute and validate, so it
would make sense to pay a fee everytime you ask one.
Does any of this makes any sense to you ?

Hello all,
It seems there was a problem with my first email (thank you Mark for the
heads up), so I'll copy paste it there :

Hi Rob,
Thank you for answering.
'free compute resources' ?
Not free. As I stated in my second email ("some more thoughts" etc.), it
seems really fitting to pay a fee to the network for every metric request
you send. 'I want to execute this request on your blockchain, and I want
the response to be approved by the Bitcoin network, and here is a fee for
all the computing trouble".
You either have the blockchain and the hardware resources to compute things
based on it, or you have addresses that takes a few bytes of data in your
environement but contains money, potentially a lot. The situation seems
plausible to me.
The thing is, as soon as there is an exchange of value (hardware computing
resources vs bitcoins) between parties that do not trust each other, there
is a need for proof of work, and thus my idea (in my second email) of a
specifc block chain that would store metric requests, current block number
when they were asked, and hash of theirs responses. This can be validated
by others nodes and as such can be published in a ledger just like bitcoin
yoru node :p
The idea would have been actually to be able to get these computations in a
trusted way without having access to a specific trusted node. Compensating
absence of trust by providing actual money.
Anyways. I got quite a few answer privately, and after study it seems SPV
mode of bitcoinj will be just fine for my specific needs. I would have
liked the solution to be network-centric ideally (By committing to an
SPV-ready API like bitcoinj, I'm committing to languages that provide a
stable SPV API), but I'll be just fine with bitcoinj for now.
Thank you Rob and everyone for your time.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] The difficulty of writing consensus 
Thinking out loud here : would it make sense to separate the consensus code
into some kind of "Bitcoin Kernel" (similar to the Linux Kernel) project
that could be used by anyone ?
Bitcoin Core (and any other application wishing to do so) could be based on
The kernel would just contain the absolute minimum code for reaching
consensus, leaving every other aspects of the implementation to the
applications built with it.
It would be stateless : it would provide an interface to submit a
block/transaction to be validated, including the context needed to validate
it (the previously validated blocks referenced by this block/transaction).
What do you think ?

As a side note, you may be interested about the 2D-Doc, which is a new
French standard used to protect documents such as address proofs or
invoice. I've been involved with it closely at work.
Every 2d-Doc include an ECDSA signature inside a 2D barcode, the key being
that the barcode is a Datamatrix and not a QR code.
If any of you can read French, the technical specification of the standard
can be found here ::
Basically, a short summary of the protected document is encoded inside the
barcode, followed by an ECDSA signature of the summary (still in the
barcode). The signature is done by an official, government-approved 2D-Doc
emitter. The 2D-Code contains a short reference (a few bytes) to designate
which emitter signed it, and then you can lookup the 2D-Doc TSL supplied by
the French government to get all the X509 Certificates from every emitters
you are interested in, in order to check the signature.
While 2D-Doc solve a very different problem than Bitcoin + BIP70, you may
be interested in knowing about it as hundred of thousands of them have been
emitted successfully while solving one of the problem you face : embedding
an ECDSA signature inside a 2D barcode.
Thank you for your time,

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Proposed alternatives to the 20MB step 
Matt : I think proposal  and  are a lot better than  and  is my
I see two problems with proposal The first problem with proposal  is that, as we see in democracies,
there is often a mismatch between the people conscious vote and these same
people behavior.
Relying on an  intentional vote made consciously by miners by choosing a
configuration value can lead to twisted results if their actual behavior
doesn't correlate with their vote (eg, they all vote for a small block size
because it is the default configuration of their software, and then they
fill it completely all the time and everything crashes).
The second problem with proposal  is that if Gavin and Mike are right,
there is simply no time to gather a meaningful amount of votes over the
coinbases, after the fork but before the Bitcoin scalability crash.
I like proposal  because the "vote" is made using already available data.
Also there is no possible mismatch between behavior and vote. As a miner
you vote by choosing to create a big (or small) block, and your actions
reflect your vote. It is simple and straightforward.
My feelings on proposal  is it is a little bit mixing apples and oranges,
but I may not seeing all the implications.

It will get correct results about :
- the existence every block
- the existence of every transaction
It will get incorrect results :
- about the *nature* of some transactions
- and therefore, about the balances of some wallets.
I fully agree with Mike here.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Let's deploy BIP65 CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY! 
I fail to see how the number of confirmations has anything to do with it.
With a non-upgraded Bitcoin software during a soft fork, you get the same
blocks as everyone else, and you get the same confirmed transactions as
everyone else. So you do have the exact same "writings" as everyone else to
calculate your balance.
The problem is that some transactions that are meaningless to you are
actually meaningful to people using an upgraded Bitcoin software.
Therefore during a softfork, while you can not miss the *existence* of a
transaction, you can miss its *meaning*.
If Bitcoin was just a decentralized whiteboard for people to write on it,
that would be no problem.
But as soon as you try to actually use Bitcoin (that is, calculate the
accurate balance of a wallet in a very broad sense), you can be led a wrong
result if you did not upgrade, which is a critical problem for financial
And because nothing prevent people to send you transactions of a new type,
you have no way to "opt out" of this problem.
