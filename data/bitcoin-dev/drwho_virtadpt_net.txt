Not lately.  It's pretty CPU and network intensive, which may or may
not be detrimental to your use case.
I keep meaning to read through these security analyses of Bitmessage
but I'm a little short on compute cycles at the moment:

DLP (data loss prevention) products usually have MITM capability, to
make sure that proprietary information isn't being exfiltrated.  Also,
some companies have full packet capture policies.  The technology is
out there and people buy and use it.  Whether or not they're going to
care about Bitcoin URIs in the short term, I don't know.
Some of the companies documented here have such products:
You are correct in that the incentive to carry out MITM attacks in
this use case may not be there.  However, detecting transactions may
be more useful to an attacker than meddling with them.

We're seeing the same thing happen to a couple of developers active in
the censorship circumvention problem space as well (though it's not
for the first time it's happened).
Perhaps they have other motives for attempting a cybil attack against
developers than trying to acquire Bitcoins.  Say, by making it easier
to subtitute alternate versions which are instrumented to make the
users easier to spy upon and later take down?
