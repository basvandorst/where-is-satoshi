@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP039 - How to add a Portuguese wordlist? 
Hello,
Since Portuguese is considered the 6th most spoken language in the world
and is an official language in 10 countries, I'd like to propose the
expansion of the BIP039 wordlist to Portuguese or help if someone had
already proposed it. What should I do?
