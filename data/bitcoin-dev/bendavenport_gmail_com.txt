Love what's happening here, and how quickly things are moving, from initial
concept, to first implementation, to first transaction.
But may I suggest we consider changing the name "stealth address" to
something more neutral?
Already, many people on Reddit and elsewhere are misinterpreting the
purpose of such addresses, whether for tax evasion, criminal activity, or
who knows what. Bitcoin already has plenty of political hurdles based
sheerly on the technology. We don't need to make life harder for ourselves.
Even forgetting about politics, the "stealth" association just seems to
imply something secretive going on. Is a Fortune 500 company or worldwide
charity going to want to use something called a "stealth address"?
I'd propose the alternate term "routing address".
- It's a descriptive, neutral term
- It accurately describes what the address is: it's a way to route payment
to a recipient, but not the actual final address
- It can be analogized to a bank's routing number: It is uniquely, publicly
and persistently tied to the receiving institution. The payor and payee
knows when payment is made using it, but it's not publicly visible.
That's the best I've got, but here are some alternate terms in case that
doesn't work:
- reusable public address
- permanent public address
- permanent address
- static address
I don't like these quite as much because they're not as clear. Normal
addresses are all reusable, permanent and static -- they just _shouldn't_
be used that way.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Suggestion: allow receivers to pay 
You can create a transaction which spends the output to yourself, attaching
a fee to that transaction. In order for miners to grab the transaction fee
on that transaction, they would have to also mine the original transaction.
Likely, you'd have to do this by hand, but software could be written to
simplify doing it. No protocol changes needed.

Well, at least we don't have to worry about cache invalidation.

Another vote in support of uBTC. I made my position clear in May of last
year. Since then, Dogecoin has essentially PROVEN the psychological value
of a low-valued large-balance currency.

I fully support this (it's what I suggested over a year ago), but what it
comes down to is BitPay, Coinbase, Blockchain and Bitstamp getting
together, agreeing what they're going to use, and doing a little joint
customer education campaign around it. If there's community momentum around
"bits", great.
My only addition is that I think we should all stop trying to attach SI
prefixes to the currency unit. Name me another world currency that uses SI
prefixes. No one quotes amounts as 63 k$ or 3 M$. The accepted standard at
least in the US is , i.e. $63k or $3M.
That may not be accepted form everywhere, but in any case it's an informal
format, not a formal one. The important point is there should be one base
unit that is not modified with SI prefixes. And I think the arguments are
strong for that unit being = 100 satoshi.

My point is that you never apply the prefixes to the currency unit itself.
We don't spend kilodollars or megadollars.
