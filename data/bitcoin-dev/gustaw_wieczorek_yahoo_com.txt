Yeah, let's build a backbone, or a cloud, and then we could have Google run it!
Come on, Mike, your conflict-of-interest as an employee is hanging out in the open, flapping in the breeze here...? Don't you think it's a bit obvious for somebody in your position to advocate centralization of infrastructure, especially when it comes to bitcoin?
On the other hand, I guess your blind trust in IP addresses as a solid foundation for security is why you were so shocked when the NSA hacked your "backbone".
