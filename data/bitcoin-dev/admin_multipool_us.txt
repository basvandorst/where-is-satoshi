@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] We need to fix the block withholding attack 
Any attempt to 'fix' this problem, would most likely require changes to all
mining software, why not just make mining more decentralized in general?
For example, allow anyone to submit proofs of work to Bitcoind that are
some fraction of the network difficulty and receive payment for them if
they're valid.  This would also encourage the proliferation of full nodes
since anyone could solo mine again.  Then, the next coinbase transaction
could be split among, say, the top 100 proofs of work.
Eligius already does their miner payouts like this.
If you want to fix an issue with mining, fix the selfish mining issue first
as it's a much larger and more dangerous potential issue.
I don't believe it was ever clearly established whether Eligius suffered a
block withholding attack or was just the victim of a miner with (what was,
at the time) a large amount of faulty hardware, however, from the
Bitcointalk threads at the time I believe it was assumed to be the latter.

Agreed, however I don't think it would be impossible or even really that
difficult, and would be a great way to increase decentralization while
simultaneously fixing other issues with mining.
Proofs of work would be valid if they're built on top of the current block
hash, and we could require (difficulty/N) proofs of work that are >=
(difficulty/N) to assemble a valid block.  Same as mining shares work.
The block assembler who finds the final diff/N 'share' could get a small
bonus as an incentive to complete the block as quickly as possible.  Or
alternatively, a checksum could be computed of all the current diff/N
shares in the mempool and that way only the final share would need to be
broadcasted to the entire network, and clients with the correct checksum
could assemble the block themselves without having to download the entire
block.  This would drastically decrease data usage on the network.
Yes, that's what I'm talking about.
The possibility that a previously 'good' actor with 30% of the hashpower
going 'rogue' becomes more and more of a concern as the block subsidy
What is the incentive not to go on record about this?

This I disagree with -- if they know that they have been attacked, then
there is every reason to come forward with this information.
First of all, it offers an explanation for poor profits (this is better
than unexplained poor profits).
Second of all, if one pool can be attacked then any pool can be attacked --
this is not a reason not to mine on a particular pool.  If anything, it's a
reason to diversify hashrate among many pools.

My nodes are continuously running getblocktemplate and getinfo, and I also
suspected the issue is in either gbt or the rpc server.
The instance only takes a few hours to get up to that memory usage.

I should also mention that this is definitely not an attack coming from
connected nodes.  My node experiencing the issue is only connected to 3
other nodes, all of which I control (via connect=).

This is a real issue.  The bitcoind process is getting killed every few
days when it reaches around 55gb of usage on my server.
