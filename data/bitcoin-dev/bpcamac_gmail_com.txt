Sounds like this part of Bitcoin (block sharing) would definitely benefit from having a REST (HTTP) API.
REST-based web APIs are a common feature of most online services these days.  Makes writing other client services so much easier.  Plus you get the benefit of the HTTP ecosystem for free (HTTP caches, etc).

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Modularizing Bitcoin 
It would be nice if that modularization effort would first and foremost focus on defining the protocols and APIs of the various modules (their responsibilities and patterns of interaction), rather than merely refactoring existing code.
Such an approach has many benefits.  First, it promotes diversity of implementations.  Diverse implementations are now possible because the correctness of an implementation is now determined entirely by the compliance of its external behavior with the stated protocols and not its internal design. Thus this approach allows for equivalent but alternate implementations. Consequently, this approach -
1. increases the available pool of developers
2. reduces the impact any one implementation defect can have on the overall Bitcoin infrastructure
3. allows enhancement/optimization work of modules to proceed more easily as coupling with external modules is reduced
Second, and just as important, it allows analysis and critiquing of Bitcoin's infrastructure to be undertaken at a higher level than source code: i.e. abstract entities of the protocols and APIs.  Such scrutiny is important to being able to effectively manage the evolution of a system's architecture.
Its been my first-hand experience across many projects that this strategy contributes directly to significant improvements to quality when developing large, distributed, complex software systems.  Indeed, its considered a best practice when developing enterprise-grade software.
I would be happy to collaborate with others in such an undertaking.
