Has there been any thought to standardizing file names used when creating
.psbt files? Maybe something that gives some reliability of being collision
resistant and descriptive. For example:
[8 char trim of hash of unsigned tx]+[Role that created file (Ex:
Signer)]+[4 char trim of hash of data unique to that role (Ex: partial sig)]
It may be useful to especially the combiner to have some idea of what files
they have.

I am working on a python implementation of BIP 174 as part of a multi-sig hardware wallet I have in the works. I am not so far along as to say that all these changes are way too late, but I?ll comment on the following:
I believe the key-value map model should be kept because as Jonas Schnelli said it?s probably not worth significantly breaking existing implementations like Peter Gray?s, or maybe more who have not spoken up. However, I appreciate the benefit of the set model particularly in regards to size consideration and the merging of redeemscripts and witnesscripts into single ?scripts? records.
This idea makes a lot of sense, much more intuitive.
I was hoping for some standard here was well and I agree using something more compact than hex is important. My understanding is Z85 is better for use with JSON than Base64, which is probably a good benefit to have here.
I will continue developing under the current spec and if there ends up being consensus for some of the changes here I?m fine with re-doing the work. I will be following this thread closer now.
