============================== START ==============================
Would it be possible to port some of the existing translations?
Something is better than nothing so some text that is close to the wx
version can just be copied.
Though IMHO its not a huge deal if qt is merged without all the
translations as IMHO it should be merged soon and then not the default
release GUI until its in tree for a bit (like one release) and some
translations can be built up.
IMHO it should be merged right after 0.4 is pushed.

It wont tell you if the node itself is overloaded (not just the OS'
network stack).
Looks good to me.
