*Anti-DoS Low Hanging Fruit: source IP or subnet connection limits*
If you disallow the same IP and/or subnet from establishing too many TCP
connections with your node, it becomes more expensive for attackers to use
a single host exhaust a target node's resources.  This iptables firewall
based example has almost zero drawbacks, but it is too complicated for most
people to deploy.  Yes, there is a small chance that you will block
legitimate connections, but there are plenty of other nodes for random
connections to choose from.  Configurable per source IP and source subnet
limits with sane defaults enforced by bitcoind itself would be a big
improvement over the current situation where one host address can consume
limited resources of many target nodes.
This doesn't remove the risk of a network-wide connection exhaustion attack
by a determined attacker, but it at least makes multiple types of attacks a
lot more expensive.  This also doesn't do much against the io
vulnerability, which would require major redesigns to prevent in Bitcoin.
*Want to safely delay the block size limit increase for another year or two?
*  This patch alone enables that.

Automatic heuristic driven prioritization, with sane defaults and some
configurable knobs, is exactly what I suggest.
In the short-term though, any connection limits added to the client by
default would be the simplest and easiest protection measure to audit.  It
would improve things a lot over the current situation where there are no
limits, and it requires no manual intervention from node operators.

bitcoinj-0.10 release notes:
   - We now require Bloom-capable (0.8+) peers by default and will
   disconnect from older nodes. This avoids accidental bandwidth saturation on
   mobile devices.
Given the user-security concern that Peter brings up, reconsideration of
this new default behavior in SPV clients may be warranted.

I might agree this would be helpful for the many phones plugged into power
and on wifi for large portions of the day.  However that doesn't really
help much when phone IP addresses change often as you move onto different
networks, and currently IP address is the only thing that peers can keep
track of for the goodness of a peer as there is no roaming pseudo-identity
cookie due to separate goal of anonymity?  I haven't studied the issue if
would be even possible to have both privacy protection and unique node
identifiers for anti-DoS authentication at the same time.

Since 0.8.x many MacOS X users have been experiencing periodic leveldb data

 There have been three commits in Bitcoin that attempted to fix this, one

remains at least one mysterious corruption issue on Mac where leveldb is
corrupted after a clean shutdown of Bitcoin-Qt.  After 5+ months we still
do not know why some users never see corruption while it happens often for

several months now so it was a simple matter to throw together a branch of
Bitcoin 0.8.5 with secp256k1.
This branch should theoretically work for Linux, win32 gitian and mac

to make it build with the old 0.8 makefiles without intent for production
code merge. cfields is working on autotoolizing it as one of the
prerequisites prior to inclusion into bitcoin master where it will be an
option disabled by default.

Development Roadmap of Bitcoin Core 0.9.2
The Bitcoin Core developers have a desire to do a mostly bug-fix and
translation update release in v0.9.2. A feature and string freeze will
start about 3 weeks from now.
The purpose of this development roadmap is to communicate the project
intent and to better organize volunteers. Hopefully doing so will make
clear when particular types of contributions are most welcome and help to
push the release process forward in a more timely manner while also
improving the quality of the release.  Missing a target goal is OK. The
developers may decide to delay particular goals if there are good reasons
on a case-by-case basis. While schedules may slip, it is generally a good
thing for a goal to have existed.
Schedule (subject to change)
13 May 2014: Feature freeze.  Source string freeze.  Release candidate.
20 May 2014: Testing of a release candidate is roughly a week. More time
can be added at the discretion of the developers to allow for testing if
further release candidates are deemed necessary due to subsequent changes.
Nightly Gitian Builds
To make it easier for non-developers and translators to get involved in
testing unofficial deterministic nightly builds are now available.
Translation of Bitcoin Core
Transifex allows open source projects a convenient way to coordinate the
work of many translators.  Periodically English language source strings
from Bitcoin Core are synchronized to the Transifex project.  Those strings
are then translated in the convenient Transifex web interface where
contributors are able to join by creating a free account.  Senior
contributors can be promoted to a Reviewer or Maintainer role for each
language.  Developers pull from Transifex to merge translated strings back
into Bitcoin Core. As a matter of policy translations are NOT accepted via
Github pull requests as those changes would be overwritten by the next
Transifex pull and there is no clean way to keep them in sync when changes
are made in both places.
The latest version of the Translation process can be found here.
Bitcoin-Translators Announce-only List
Bitcoin-Translators mailing list is an announce-only mailing list for
developers to communicate to translators at particular times when new
translations are needed.  Replies and discussion would go to the bitcoin
dev list.  Subscriptions to this list would additionally be valuable to the
project as it allows for a convenient way to ask for translations of other
related projects like bitcoin.org that are hosted on theTransifex platform.
 Whenever source strings of significance are changed or deadlines are
announced, translators will learn of work to be done in Transifex quickly
as they will all be subscribed to this announce list.  Discussion of
translation issues should be on the Bitcoin-Development list.
Other Improvements to the Translation process
   -
   Prior to an intended release a String Freeze is declared on a particular
   date.  The string freeze exists to ensure that translators have a
   reasonable amount of time to translate new or modified source strings so
   their work can be included in a release.
   -
   A significant issue with our past translation process was the lack of
   branch support in Transifex.  This meant that since master and v0.8.2
   diverged in May 2013, translation updates made in Transifex were not
   included in the v0.8.x stable releases until the release of v0.9.0 in early
   2014.  v0.9.1 similarly was released from a branch outside from master.
    v0.9.2 is planned to be released directly from the master branch so
   translations for this upcoming release can be developed directly.  laanwj
   came up with a great idea for dealing with future releases where we will be
   able to keep translations for both diverged stable and master branch
   simultaneously in Transifex, with scripts automating the process of merging
   strings and separating them back to the diverged branches.
Please post questions or comments about the release or translation process
here on Bitcoin-Development list. Bug reports should be posted a Github

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Proposal: Move Bitcoin Dev List to a Neutral 
Discomfort with Sourceforge
For a while now people have been expressing concern about Sourceforge's
continued hosting of the bitcoin-dev mailing list.  Downloads were moved
completely to bitcoin.org after the Sept 2014 hacking incident of the SF
project account.  The company's behavior and perceived stability have been
growing to be increasingly questionable.
November 2013: GIMP flees SourceForge over dodgy ads and installer
May 28th, 2015: SourceForge replacing GIMP Windows downloads
June 3rd, 2015: Sourceforge hijacked nmap's old site and downloads.
When this topic came up over the past two years, it seemed that most people
agreed it would be a good idea to move.  Someone always suggests Google
Groups as the replacement host.  Google is quickly shot down as too
controversial in this community, and it becomes an even more difficult
question as to who else should host it.  Realizing this is not so simple,
discussion then dies off until the next time somebody brings it up.
Somebody brought it up again this past week.
It seems logical that an open discussion list is not a big deal to continue
to be hosted on Sourceforge, as there isn?t much they could do to screw it
up.  I personally think moving it away now would be seen as a gesture that
we do not consider their behavior to be acceptable.  There are also some
benefits in being hosted elsewhere, at an entity able to professionally
maintain their infrastructure while also being neutral to the content.
Proposal: Move Bitcoin Dev List to a Neutral Competent Entity
Bitcoin is a global infrastructure development project where it would be
politically awkward for any of the existing Bitcoin companies or orgs to
host due to questions it would raise about perceived political control.
For example, consider a bizarro parallel universe where MtGox was the
inventor of Bitcoin, where they hosted its development infrastructure and
dev list under their own name.  Even if what they published was 100%
technically and ideologically equivalent to the Bitcoin we know in our
dimension, most people wouldn't have trusted it merely due to appearances
and it would have easily gone nowhere.
I had a similar thought process last week when sidechains code was
approaching release. Sidechains, like Bitcoin itself, are intended to be a
generic piece of infrastructure (like ethernet?) that anyone can build upon
and use.  We thought about Google Groups or existing orgs that already host
various open source infrastructure discussion lists like the IETF or the
Linux Foundation.  Google is too controversial in this community, and the
IETF is seen as possibly too politically fractured.  The Linux Foundation
hosts a bunch of infrastructure lists
 and it seems that
nobody in the Open Source industry considers them to be particularly
objectionable.  I talked with LF about the idea of hosting generic
Bitcoin-related infrastructure development lists.  They agreed as OSS
infrastructure dev is already within their charter, so early this week
sidechains-dev list began hosting there.
great fit.  Why?  While they are interested in supporting general open
source development, the LF has literally zero stake in this.  In addition
to neutrality, they seem to be suitable as a competent host.  They have
full-time sysadmins maintaining their infrastructure including the Mailman
server. They are soon upgrading to Mailman 3 ,
which means mailing lists would benefit from the improved archive browser.
I am not personally familiar with HyperKitty, but the point here is they
are a stable non-profit entity who will competently maintain and improve
things like their Mailman deployment (a huge improvement over the stagnant
Sourceforge).  It seems that LF would be competent, neutral place to host
dev lists for the long-term.
To be clear, this proposal is only about hosting the discussion list.  The
LF would have no control over the Bitcoin Project, as no single entity
Proposed Action Plan
   -
   Discuss this openly within this community.  Above is one example of a
   great neutral and competent host.  If the technical leaders here can agree
   to move to a particular neutral host then we do it.
   -
   Migration: The current list admins become the new list admins.  We
   import the entire list archive into the new host's archives for user
   convenience.
   -
     Kill bitcoin-list and
   bitcoin-test.  Very few people actually use it.  Actually, let's delete the
   entire Bitcoin Sourceforge project as its continued existence serves no
   purpose and it only confuses people who find it.  By deletion, nobody has
   to monitor it for a repeat of the Sept 2014 hacking incident
    or GIMP-type
   hijacking ?
   -
   The toughest question would be the appropriateness of auto-importing the
   subscriber list to another list server, as mass imports have a tendency to
   upset people.

While I agree this is a good idea, this should not be a precondition for
moving the public bitcoin-dev list.  The security team needs to separately
research/write tools needed for this.
 warren, wanna just go ahead and create bitcoin-development @ LF?
*More Feedback?*  As for going ahead, perhaps we should wait to hear from
more of the other technical leaders?
*More Questions*
*List Name?*  Would people prefer "bitcoin-development" for he new list
name instead of a shorter name like "bitcoin-dev"?  I personally like the
shorter name, but either is fine.
 currently has
"sidechains-dev", and "lightning-dev" is moving there sometime soon.
*Proposed Cut-Off Date?*  Then we also need to agree on a date to cut off
the old list.  Their sysadmin said we could have the new list auto-post
from the old list for a short while.  I wonder how well that works ... if
that will result in double posting if people write to the new and CC the
old list.  Needs a little research how well it would behave to have both
lists operating during a transition period.  I think we should announce a
cut-off date when posts to the old list is shut off, July 15th, one month
from now.  Thoughts?
*Moderators?*  Mailman on the new server allows having separate logins for
admins and moderators.  I think the admins of the old SF project are gavin,
jgarzik and sipa... they are kind of busy.  Perhaps we should identify
known trusted community members who can help with moderation.  Usually this
is dealing with "held" messages that are flagged by the spam filter

Off-list I heard a suggestion to make the cut-off date as short as one week
after the new list is announced and people are given the option to
subscribe.  Could people please post feelings about this?
It seems most everyone agreed not to auto-subscribe everyone onto the new
list as that tends to be upsetting.
There is clarity if subscribing the old list to the new list is a good
idea.  Is anyone familiar with Mailman, is it smart enough to somehow
prevent double-posts if someone writes to both the old and new address?

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Mailman incompatibility with DKIM ... 
Both you and jgarzik experienced mail getting tossed into gmail's spam
folder thanks to DKIM... I am concerned that DKIM is too fragile and not
very compatible with mailing lists.
We already removed the footer because it was incompatible with DKIM
signing.  Keeping the "[Bitcoin-dev] " prepend tag in subject is compatible
with DKIM header signing only if the poster manually prepends it in their
subject header.
I am already concerned that the lack of the Mailman footer will make it
hard to identify where exactly subscribers need to go to unsubscribe or
look at archives.  Removing the subject tag might make DKIM enforcement
work a lot better, but I can easily see our obtuse subscribers as being
extra confused by this.

The new list currently has footers removed during testing.  I am not
pleased with the need to remove the subject tag and footer to be more
compatible with DKIM users.
I'm guessing DKIM enforcement is not very common because of issues like
It seems that Sourceforge silently drops DKIM enforced mail like
jgarzik's.  LF seems to pass along their mail but mangles the header/body
and makes DKIM verification fail, which causes gmail to toss it into the
spam folder.  I think this behavior is slightly worse than Sourceforge
because it makes the poster think their message was successfully sent (it
is in the archive), but many subscribers never see it due to the spam
I don't see any good solution to this except an auto-reject for DKIM
enforced domain postings.  Yes this is rather terrible, but the instant
rejection is vastly better than Sourceforge silently dropping the post or
LF getting stuck in spam filters.
We should also auto-reject any other reason for mail getting stuck in the
moderation queue like including non-subscribers.  I considered
auto-rejecting spam too, but that could go horribly wrong as a false From
address could make the Mailman server into a spammer itself.  We may have
no choice but to silently drop spam for that reason.

I understand the reason to protect the "heavily phished" domains.  I heard
that LKML does not modify the subject or add a footer, perhaps because it
would make it incompatible with DKIM of the several big corporate domains
who participate.
I suppose it is somewhat acceptable for us to remove subject tags and
footers if we have no choice...

This is an important notice to all members of the Bitcoin Dev List.

   reject all posts.

posts.   Anything posted prior to the switchover on Tuesday will be wiped
from the archives.

A current issue with this list is posts from domains that require DKIM
signature verification will end up in the spam folder at popular providers
like gmail.  Initially the new list will have that exact same problem as we
will continue to have the subject tag and footer.  Within a few weeks LF
will upgrade Mailman to do automatic Munge From

Your first post to this list may be delayed by 5+ minutes due to Greylisting
. Subsequent posts should go

   - LF will be upgrading Mailman soon to better handle posts from DKIM

   - There will be a few more config tweaks like auto-rejecting
   non-subscribed posts.  Nobody has time to moderate this list, and mail
   silently disappearing into the moderation hold blackhole is worse than an
   instant reject message telling people to subscribe.   Unfortunately, it is
   too dangerous to auto-reject spam ... those messages need to go into a

I am skeptical that any license for the blockchain itself is needed because
of the possibility that the blockchain is not entitled to copyright
protection.  While I am not a lawyer, I have stared hard at the copyright
doctrine of the U.S. in multiple law school Intellectual Property courses
and during my previous career in Open Source Software where copyright
matters a great deal.
As each owner of a
This portion of your paper I believe is not true and requires citations if
you want to be convincing.  Is it truly "creative and non-obvious"?  My
understanding under at least U.S. law, the blockchain may not be entitled
to copyright protection because a compilation created in a mechanical
manner is not a creative work of a human.
I suppose a transaction could contain a "creative" element if it contains
arbitrary bytes of a message or clever script.  For the most part though
most of what you call "digitally signing a hash of the previous transaction
along with the new owner?s public key" is purely the result of a mechanical
process and really is not creative.  Furthermore, even if that output were
"non-obvious", obviousness has nothing to do with copyrightability.
Your license is correct in intent in attempting to exclude from the royalty
free grant works within the blockchain that themselves may be subject to
copyright of third parties.  The elements within the blockchain may be
entitled individually to copyright if they are in any way a creative work
of a human, but as a compilation I am doubtful the blockchain itself is
entitled to copyright.
I understand copyright with respect to databases can be different under
other jurisdictions.  Your paper mentions the European database law that is
indeed different from the U.S.  Your paper is incomplete in scholarly and
legal citations.  I myself and we as a community don't know enough.  I
suppose this topic merits further study.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Fee smoothing 
I do not believe your logic is correct.  Reducing the marginal benefit of
including an additional transaction is problematic because it
simultaneously increases the orphan risk while it reduces the reward.  90%
of the fee going to the next block would also create new incentive problems
like mining an empty block to minimize the chance of losing 90% of the fees
from the previous block to an orphan.  Another major issue with mandatory
sharing is if the miner doesn't want to share, nothing stops them from
taking payment out-of-band and confirming the transaction with little or no
fees visible in the block.
I had been thinking recently about fee deferral for a different reason.  In
the future when the subsidy is much smaller in proportion to the fees,
there may be little incentive to confirm on top of someone else's block in
cases when the expected value of replacing the current tip is higher.  I
think smoothing fees between the current and subsequent 5 blocks (for
example) might reduce the incentive of this type of behavior.  The main
risk here might be in weakening too far the incentive of adding more
transactions to the current block, as I believe your 10% current and 90%
subsequent reward split would do.  I think my idea of a mandatory split
between six blocks might also be a failure because of the high incentive to
conduct out-of-band payments.
2. This is a step towards a free fee market. In an ideal market,
While I don't agree with the rest of your logic, it is agreeable that you
care about aligning the miner's supply incentives with the global marginal
cost.  If you believe that is an important goal, you might like the Flex
Cap approach as presented by Mark Friedenbach at Scaling Bitcoin Hong Kong.
Under the general idea of the Flex Cap approach block size is no longer
fixed, it can be bursted higher on a per-block basis if the miner is
willing to defer a tiny portion of the current block subsidy to pay out to
the miner of later blocks.  If conditions are such that there is genuine
demand then some are willing to pay higher fees for time preference.  Some
formula would balance the cost and reward in some manner like: add the
value of newly included fees, subtract the expected marginal cost of orphan
risk, then subtract the portion of subsidy deferred.  Flex cap has periodic
block size retargets to allow for a temporary limit to rise or fall to
something resembling actual market demand.  This temporary limit is never a
"wall" that can be hit as miners can choose to burst past it if the cost is
worth the reward.
Flex Cap is an area of ongoing research that I strongly believe would
benefit Bitcoin in the long-term.  For this reason it requires careful
study and simulations to figure out specifics.

There is another variant of the Flex Cap approach that allows miners to pay
with a slightly higher difficulty target instead of deferring a portion of
subsidy to later blocks.  I think the HK presentation was about the subsidy
deferral variant because of miner feedback that they preferred that
Myself and a few other developers think proposals like BIP100 where the
block size is subject to a vote by the miners is suboptimal because this
type of vote is costless.  You were astute in recognizing in your post it's
a good thing to somehow align the global marginal cost with the miner's
incentive.  I feel a costless vote is not great because it aligns only to
the miner's marginal cost, and not the marginal cost to the entire flood
network.  Flex Cap is superior as "vote" mechanism as there is an actual
cost associated, allowing block size to grow with actual demand.

the Linux Foundation's new list infrastructure operated by groups.io. You
may continue to use these lists as-is until each list is notified that
migration is complete. It is unclear when the switch-over happens because
we need imports to complete without error and some testing to pass.
IMPORTANT: If you do not wish to be auto-subscribed to the new list
management system then please unsubscribe prior to the migration.
ARCHIVES: The archives are of utmost importance for prior art and historic
value. We are working on a plan with the Linux Foundation sysadmins to
ensure the current archive permalinks will remain as-is static or to
redirect to the correct post that lives at a new archive.
The new archive will be operated independently outside from the Linux
Foundation as generated by this open source tool. This hopefully will allow
all future archives to never move again even if the underlying list
infrastructure needs to change. Folks will appreciate the search function
and git clone for a local instance.
More details to be posted here soon.
