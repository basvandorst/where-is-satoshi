Maybe you could test out your ideas somewhere like bitcointalk.org and/or provide some more technical substance before engaging with this forum.
Developers tend to prefer dealing with numbers known to be either 1 or 0, not a variable set of possible values depending on non-technical factors ...

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] "bits": Unit of account 
Something tells me this would be reduced to a single syllable in common usage I.e. bit.
My 2 cents goes for "bit". Because: Bitcoin is a digital currency, BTC starts with "bit", "bit" refers to a small amount of something in its regular english usage and lastly 99.9876543% of people on the planet don't know what a digital "bit" is yet ...

"xbit" is only a typo or spelling error away from "XBT", and some folks may assume they refer to the same unit of measure, not knowing the new currency system as developers here do.
From your email, I got the idea of using "x" as a suffix end of a number of bits e.g. 17500x, like cents or centavos. I guess this might clash with formal S.I. notation but it's easy to read and has less ambiguity, IMHO.

Excuse the ignorance, but there is something I?m not getting in this discussion.
Given it?s a published protocol, with available source code running on an open P2P network, why would any messages between nodes benefit from being encrypted? Surely all the data being processed by the network is known to any persistent client node(s)? Seems like that solution is orthogonal to the root problem, where attackers could monitor the network and deduce IP addresses by e.g. mapping senders of transactions.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256
Hence my suggestion of separating that surface by using the standalone Tor binary, which runs under a different user to the Bitcoin Core binary.
First of all, without encryption we're leaking significant amounts of information to any passive attacker trying to trace the origin of Bitcoin transactions, a significant privacy risk.
Secondly the upcoming v0.10's fee estimation implementation is quite vulnerable to Sybil attacks. Authentication and encryption are needed to make it secure from ISP-level targeting to ensure that your view of the network is representative. Tor support used in parallel with native connection is ideal here, as neither the Tor network nor your ISP alone can Sybil attack you. It's notable that Bitcoinj has already implemented Tor support for these same reasons.

Second this comment.
A change like this so soon after mt gox debacle would be one more sign of bitcoins 'instability' for skeptics and average folk who read only headlines.
In general, it seems some people are looking to try and change the publics mental price of BTC which is more of a non-technical challenge.

Think your example is not quite valid ...
People say or write $88M or $45k I.e. use SI prefix as a suffix, else it would be more, not less, clear on what amount is being referred to.
For me, "bits" are easy to say and one million as a factor is simple to understand.
M-bits, kilobits, millibits, etc are never going to be used by folk in everyday transactions, IMHO

Following this, Bitcoin and proposed payment networks like LN will be
competing for fees based on duration and cost to process transactions.
If fees on Bitcoin network stay low and zero-conf txns are possible,
competing payment networks will need some very special features to survive
and make money for their investors.

While greatly appreciating your prior efforts in crypto-ccy R&D and
current efforts for Blockstream, its not a plus for your reputation to be
using emotive terms like ?attack?, ?fork war" and throwing so much FUD

Paranoia, much? Or perhaps the ?enemies" of Bitcoin are just sitting patiently, waiting for
it to collapse in time due to its internal contradictions.
Reply-To:  Dave Scotese Three things:
1) Hostility is generally the result of perceived hostility.  If you assume
the best intentions of another person, you will eventually find yourself in
one of two places.  Either you will find truth with that person (becuase
they are also seeking it), or you will drive them away (because you will ask
questions that can't be answered by someone trying to deceive).
2) The Wiki says "The current Core developers are Wladimir J. van der Laan,
Gavin Andresen, Jeff Garzik, Gregory Maxwell, and Pieter Wuille."  I've seen
no hostility from any of these people.
3) The people who are threatened by Bitcoin aren't stupid enough to ignore
  Can anyone imagine that they have not hired highly skilled
psychological warfare agnts to do everything they can to "help" assault what
we decentralization enthusiasts have been working for?
About  I'm actually blind to hostility, and that is an intentional
affectation in response to my recognition of  and  together.  If you
feel another person has expressed a bad idea, just ignore it.  If you feel
they might be misleading others, post a reply about what you know to clear
up any possible misconceptions.  There is no point in identifying
individuals who are being hostile, or pointing out hostility, or being
divisive.  Let the rest of us recognize it on our own.  Maybe send something
like what I'm writing now.
PS: If anyone is interested in conspiracy theories, I had written this into
my gmail compose window and (presumably) hit a wrong key which caused the
thread to be marked as spam and deleted my whole reply.  It hadn't even
saved a draft.  I've never seen gmail not save a draft before.

+1 on the comments below by Thomas. "Fee market" is not a binary option, either on or off.  Like all markets it exists in varying degrees over time and with more or less influence on the process of which it is part of.  As it stands now, and likely for another decade at least, the fee per tx constitutes a very, very weak market signal for the miners since it makes up less than 0.5% of the rewards paid for mining a full block. This is the normal and expected scenario, aimed at driving use of Bitcoin as widely and cheaply as possible so that network effects will cement Bitcoin for the future, for all users.
As a comparison, how many people would have
 taken up using email if there had been a per-message fee and hourly sending limits with only the highest-fee messages being delivered? And how would it look if the email protocol developers imposing fees & hourly sending limits were pushing hard for use of another email-delivery protocol on
 top of the existing one?

Timeframe for network congestion and users experiencing service
degradation => between now and middle of next year.
Timeframe for transaction fees topping block reward fees => many years in
the future, based on current ratio of block reward to fees.
What is the more pressing requirement now? A working ?fee market? or a
reliable, useful payment network that scales without falling over in the
next 2-3 years.

I don?t believe we have to decide, the miners will do that and are doing

Hmmm. What should be the price of an email? How much should DARPA have

Some people in the conversation appear to be uncomfortable, perturbed,
defensive etc about the proposal ?. But I am not seeing specifics on why it

I have explained why I believe there is some urgency, whereby "some urgency"
I mean, assuming it takes months to implement, merge, test, release and for

I agree with Mike Hearn that there is no consensus on using a soft fork to

consensus or else there is arbitrary disagreement. You cannot have it both
It is very important that we reach consensus on consensus or, if you will,
meta0consensus. I think we should Do nothing as that is clearly the choice
that we have taken re: blocksize. If we use one set of rules for that
decision we should use the same set of rules for all decisions and there is
no middle ground.
