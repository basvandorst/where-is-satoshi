Hi Everyone,
I would like to share my serious work on reducing the energy consumption of
PoW without sacrificing security. My new type of algorithm is called PoLW.
For a practical system where mining is profitable, PoLW could actually
improve the security of the system.
The idea is to shift part of the external cost of mining in the physical
world (mainly energy consumption) to the internal cost of the network. In
PoLW, the miners are able to give up part of the coinbase reward so as to
get weight (> 1) for the block hash they produce. The total cost of
generating a new block would still be equal to maximal coinbase reward in
I analyzed two algorithms in the paper: linear PoLW and exponential PoLW.
Linear PoLW could reduce energy consumption by a factor close to 1/2 in
equilibrium, while exponential PoLW could reduce energy consumption by an
arbitrary factor in equilibrium.
In a practical system, mining is usually (if not always) profitable. If we
transition from PoW to PoLW, the external costs of mining would decrease
and the internal costs will increase. However, the decrease in external
costs would be less than the increase in internal costs since mining is
profitable. The total cost of block generation would get higher, therefore,
the security will increase.
Of course, we could not decrease the external costs of any existing system
by a factor close to zero immediately. There is a section in my paper
discussing this particularly. The principle of applying PoLW is that
keeping the absolute external cost increasing all the time, but the
percentage of external cost in the total cost gets lower eventually.
This work is based on solid math calculation, and I am looking forward to
feedback and discussions. My paper is available at:
It's inspired by the recent great paper of Itay, Alexander, and Ittay:

Hi Runchao,
- 1st question regarding double spending:
We won't allow a miner to sacrifice coinbase reward as much as possible for
a practical system. This will be achieved by setting a dynamic upper bound
for the number of rewards the miner could sacrifice. The upper bound would
be related to the actual mining difficulty (not the weighted one) of the
recent mining epoch.
In Section 8 of the paper, I discussed quite a lot about how to select
system parameters and how to transition the current PoW systems to PoLW.
Just for an example, for Bitcoin, we might transition from giving up 0
coinbase reward to giving up maximal 10% coinbase reward. In the long term,
if the value of Bitcoin goes as comparable to gold, we could allow the
miners to give up more rewards. The network could adjust these bounds
solely based on the internal state (i.e. the actual mining difficulty).
In short, PoLW could reduce the energy consumption of Bitcoin in
equilibrium from coinbase reward to even sub-linear. Still, the absolute
energy consumption would be kept at a sufficiently high level.
- 2nd question regarding tx fees:
We could simply reduce this problem to purely coinbase reward by adding tx
fees into the maximal coinbase reward. When the tx fees dominant miner's
profits, we could simply allow negative coinbase reward (i.e. miners spend
coins for the coinbase transaction).
Note that, using PoLW, we could remove the halving mechanism, as PoLW is
adaptive already.
Best, Cheng!
