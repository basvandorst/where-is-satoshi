Hi All,
This is a bit tangential to the conversation, but since the genesis of this conversation is Mike's decentralization blog post, I decided to post here.
Perhaps the solution to the mining problem lies in the reward structure rather than in the proof of work/asics.
Is it possible instead to allocate a portion of the reward to " a # of runner up(s)" even though the runner-up(s) block will be orphaned? For example, X% of the block reward goes to Y number of runner-ups based on some type of criteria?
This will appear to be a bit like a tax on the winner, but it could potentially solve the problem, since a large pool would not want to split the pool up to solve multiple blocks.
There are some possible downsides, like probably having to keep those orphaned blocks around in the future, etc.
If this is possible, the question that remains then, what would be the criteria for the X% payout/allocation?

Thanks Mike.
Indeed, I am aware of current approach, which is why I was suggesting this as an alternative.
I haven't thought about it enough, and perhaps it was too radical a rethinking - just wanted to see what the smarter minds thought.
Thanks again.

I wish you were just as prudent when you were recommending full RBF to mining pools.
