@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Roadmap to getting users onto SPV clients 
Gavin's grandma needs to be able to use bitcoin.  Here is a real world
sampling of the types of people wanting to use bitcoin but are having some
difficulty which I have collected from Facebook.  Should we listen to the
end user? :-P
*"what is the intention of Bitcoin? Is it supposed to be - eventually - for
dummies like myself or is it just for those individuals who are code and
algorithm writers? I downloaded a wallet but how do I know if I need more
software or a massive computer system to solve "the problem" for the next
block? With all the talk of mathematical problem solving on a world wide
network of computers I can't see a small laptop figuring out anything thus
not gaining any bitcoins. Why should I be interested in this if it appears
it's just for computer scientists?"*
*"hi, instaled bitcoin qt, but after it dowladed all the stuff, now i get
DEP protecction from windows, and it tells me bitcoinQT need to run with
DEP on, dont let me make an exception for it, nor work it i turn DEP only
for sys, so hwat i should do?"*
*"hi, i'm new to bitcoin, i got a bunch of free bitcoins from a bunch of
the free sites. how come when i tried to send my bitcoins to myself, it
says the fee exceeds the balance? I thought there was no fees?"*
*"Is there a way to speed up the process of synchronisation with the
network? It has been taken ages on my MAC.*
*Any help would be nice"*
*and more...*
Sorry if this doesn't belong to the bitcoin-development email list.  I just
see this as end-user/customer data gathering to refine the requirements,
since this is software engineering...isn't it?
