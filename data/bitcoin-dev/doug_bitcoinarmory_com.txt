> Hello everyone,
Nice paper, Pieter. I do have a bit of feedback.
1)The first sentence of "Deployment" has a typo. "We reuse the
double-threshold switchover mechanism from BIP 34, with the same
*thresholds*, [....]"
2)I think the handling of the sighash byte in the comments of
IsDERSignature() could use a little tweaking. If you look at
CheckSignatureEncoding() in the actual code (src/script/interpreter.cpp
in master), it's clear that the sighash byte is included as part of the
signature struct, even though it's not part of the actual DER encoding
being checked by IsDERSignature(). This is fine. I just think that the
code comments in the paper ought to make this point clearer, either in
the sighash description, or as a comment when checking the sig size
(i.e., size-3 is valid because sighash is included), or both.
3)The paper says a sig with size=0 is correctly coded but is neither
valid nor DER. Perhaps this code should be elsewhere in the Bitcoin
code? It seems to me that letting a sig pass in IsDERSignature() when
it's not actually DER-encoded is incorrect.

(or whatever is best reference for DER).
The link you gave is to the 2002 revision.
 has the latest revision
(Nov. 2008) and, AFAIK, is the most visible link to people searching
for X.690.
That said, X.690 is the definitive DER document (if not exactly the
easiest read). A link to it wouldn't hurt.
These all look good to me.

You're welcome. All the revisions look good to me.

Hello. I've seen Greg make a couple of posts online
is one such example) where he has mentioned that Pieter has a new
proposal for allowing multiple softforks to be deployed at the same
time. As discussed in the thread I linked, the idea seems simple
enough. Still, I'm curious if the actual proposal has been posted
anywhere. I spent a few minutes searching the usual suspects (this
mailing list, Reddit, Bitcointalk, IRC logs, BIPs) and can't find

Hi Pieter. Thanks for posting the proposal. I think the concept itself
is pretty solid. I know some people have been proposing alternate
methods too. I hope they'll share here, assuming they haven't already.
As is, my comments concern typos and general copy editing.
- - Just speaking in general, I found the BIP to be a bit hard to read.
AFAIK, the basic facts are accurate. I just found myself having to
re-read certain passages two or three times. A little polish wouldn't
hurt. For example, using the "it" pronoun can be confusing, such as
multiple uses in the abstract. Specifying what "it" is (e.g., "The
proposed change relies on...") would really help. In addition, the way
the "W" value is handled seems like it could be improved a bit. I know
the wording is accurate. Seeing 1000 change to 1001 is still a little
- - In "Multi-stage soft forks," I presume the second sentence should
end as follows: "[...] with additional validation rules that get
enabled one by _one_." Depending on semantics, I'd consider changing
"one by one" to "incremental steps," but that's your call.
- - I found the "High bits" section to be confusing at first. It looks
like you chose to show everything as little endian data, matching
what's actually in the block. My personal preference would be to
represent the data, for readability purposes, as big endian. I doubt
I'm the only one who finds big endian to be much easier to process
- - Some sort of legend showing A, I, W, etc. would really help, as
opposed to just running into them as one goes along. Otherwise, the
alphabet soup can be a bit confusing.
Thanks again.
