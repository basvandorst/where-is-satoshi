Hash: SHA1
Dear Bitcoin developers,
We would like to report a vulnerability which might lead, under some
assumptions, to a double-spending attack in a fast payment scenario.
The vulnerability has been introduced due to signature encoding
incompatibilities between versions 0.8.2 (or 0.8.3) and earlier
Bitcoin versions.
Please find at the following link a detailed description of this
We contacted and informed Gavin earlier about this problem.
With best regards,
Arthur Gervais

Thank you for the reference! This is indeed a very interesting issue,
affecting the same Bitcoin version. However we think it is
complementary, since our reported problem has nothing to do with fees,
dust, nor is it necessary to send the two double-spending transaction at
the same time. In our setting, double-spending still works if the second
transaction is sent after minutes (and the first transaction has not yet
been included into a block).
Clearly, we have outlined the limits of the security of
zero-confirmation payments in an earlier work.
Our only intention is to raise the awareness for merchants who have to
accept zero-confirmation transactions. They should be aware of the
signature encoding difference between Bitcoin versions and the possible
