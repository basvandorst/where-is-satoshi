@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Secure download 
I am a newbie trying to get my first wallet up.  But I have a security/crypto background and so I know enough not to trust a http download.  But I don't see any other option to download bitcoin software from sourceforge.
I can check the SHA256 hashes, but how do I verify those?
I am familiar with gpg.  Where can I find signatures and the signing keys?  Hopefully, the keys are on multiple independent servers.
Or is read-only ssh/sftp/scp access possible?
Thanks in advance,
