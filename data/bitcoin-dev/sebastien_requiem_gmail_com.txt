Hello Angel,
Good initiative. This looks good. If I understand, the dropdown menu is for
the whole application, so it make sense to have it in a common part of the
A slight optimisation would be to write the unit in the transaction table
header too (since we read from top to bottom). This would give something
like "Amount (mBTC)". That way, the user doesn't have to think twice about
the unit of his values.
Hope it helps,

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] instant confirmation via payment protocol 
Jumping on this thread after reading it all. I am in favor of the
discount offered by the merchant.
Ideally the merchant could get the amount of the wallet *fee*
for instant payment (privacy leak?). That way, the merchant
could decide to support the instant payment at 100% (better
user experience after all) or at 50% only or at 0%.
This would encourage instant payment for merchants and buyers without
(re-)creating a non-transparent system.
