@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Improving Scalability via Block Time Decrease 
The current ten-minute block time was chosen by Satoshi as a tradeoff
between confirmation time and the amount of work wasted due to chain
splits. Is there not room for optimization in this number from:
A. Advances in technology in the last 8-9 years
B. A lack of any rigorous formula being used to determine what's the
optimal rate
C. The existence of similar chains that work at a much lower block times
Whilst I think we can all agree that 10 second block times would result in
a lot of chain splits due to Bitcoins 12-13 second propagation time (to 95%
of nodes), I think we'll find that we can go lower than 10 minutes without
much issue. Is this something that should be looked at or am I an idiot who
needs to read more? If I'm an idiot, I apologize; kindly point me in the
right direction.
Things I've read on the subject:

All the more reason to only use the most common words that meet the other
I agree - keeping "satoshi" in there is an unnecessary security risk.
