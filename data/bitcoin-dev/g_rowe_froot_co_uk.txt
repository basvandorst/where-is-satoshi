@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Announcing the IFEX Project 
Hi Walter,
This could be of interest to the XChange project. See GitHub:
The aim of this project is to provide a unifed API for applications to
access financial exchanges. At present it supports Bitcoin exchanges (MtGox
and Intersango are the primary focus with others to follow). It is in the
very early stages of development, but is likely to be integrated into the
MultiBit Bitcoin client (see  in the near future (early
prototypes are available directly from sources).
One problem that the XChange development team faces is that each exchange
rolls its own data model and uses its own protocol (web socket, socket IO,
direct socket and so on). To provide a reference implementation of how an
exchange should publish its data would be beneficial.
Kind regards,

Hi Steve,
This looks like a good idea to me. The test suites could act similarly to
the 100% Pure Java approach that successfully fended off a lot of
corrupting influences to Java over the years.
Maybe it's worth putting together a small starter suite of tests and
showing them to the community then providing a suitable process, perhaps
through BIPs, to allow tests to be created, reviewed and updated before
getting incorporated into a reference. I imagine a BIP would cover an
aspect of the blockchain rather than a single test or test suite since
having that many BIPs would get onerous fast.
Kind regards,

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Roadmap to getting users onto SPV clients 
I would like to chime on on the user experience of the SPV client (in
particular MultiBit).
Without exception, everyone that I have introduced Bitcoin (which is a lot
of people) have expected an "instant-on" experience. It has to clobber
PayPal and credit cards or people won't give it a second look, let alone a
second chance. SPV clients deliver on that expectation.
Once the user has the great initial "wow!" moment then their interest in
Bitcoin is reinforced and they tend to explore further, particularly into
the economic theory behind it. Many decide to install the full node out of
a sense of community contribution to the security of the network.
Having a hybrid mode of SPV first then full node second should be something
that a user has control over - it is their computing resources we are using
after all and Bitcoin should not be perceived as a drain.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development]  BIP 21 (modification BIP 20) 
Hi all,
Speaking on behalf of the MultiBit team (Jim's currently on holiday), we
will not be supporting Tonal Bitcoins anytime soon. Therefore we back the
BIP 21 proposal.
At present MultiBit does not support the "message" or "send" fields but we
would be happy to add this functionality as required.
Regarding the idea of a signed URI, it is appealing, however, it may not
work. If I understand it correctly, the main idea appears to be to protect
a URI from malicious replacement (at MultiBit we were concerned that a
Bitcoin "swatch" would be subjected to the same attack vector and we came
up with the term "swatch swabbing"). If a Bitcoin URI is served up from a
trusted source (e.g. a merchant site over HTTPS) then there is no need for
signing. It should be assumed that the merchant will offer a clean room
payment area so that no untrusted JavaScript will creep into the final page
and wreak havoc.
It would seem that in any situation where the attacker has complete control
over the content of the URI they will be able to successfully swab it to
match their own fraudulent address. Imagine attempting to protect a QR code
posted against a pole attempting to get BTC donations for a charity. How
long before that was replaced by a different version operated by the
thieves with good signatures all round?
Of course, I may have misunderstood so I would welcome further discussion.
One field that the MultiBit team would like to add to the BIP 21 proposal
is "expires" which would contain an ISO8601 formatted date/time in UTC
(e.g. "2000-01-01T23:59:59Z"). This would allow merchants to issue Bitcoin
URIs that would expose them to a currency/inventory risk for a defined
period of time.
Kind regards,
Gary Rowe

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] BIP 21 (modification BIP 20) 
Having closely read the BIP20 proposal, I can see your point. As I see it,
BIP 20 vs BIP 21 is about standardising on a representation of the "amount"
field. BIP 20 proposes that "amount" can contain alternative
representations, clearly defined, whereas BIP 21 requires the use of a
single representation in decimal notation.
In my view, BIP 21 still wins since it reduces complexity for the end
client both at the human and machine level.

@_author: Gary Rowe 
@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] BIP 21 (modification BIP 20) 
I think that the "send to private address" field will require more effort
to implement than the simpler "expires" and "message" fields and should be
deferred to a later BIP. There is a pressing need for expires and the only
point of contention I see is the inclusion of a dual representation (block
or timestamp).
Personally, I feel that simple is best and while a block number represents
Bitcoin's pulse, there is no guarantee that a block will be discovered at
any particular moment. From a merchant perspective the main point of the
expires field is to limit risk against currency movement (immediate cash
out) or inventory movement (time limited offer). I have difficulty seeing a
good use case that would need a block. People have been co-ordinating
events based on a UTC timestamp for decades and I think we should stick
with it.
Regarding the "version" field I again think it adds unnecessary complexity.
Pretty much everything that is needed within the Bitcoin URI scheme can be
encoded with suitable optional fields (as query params) making the whole
structure forward compatible. Having a version field seems redundant.
Finally, the URI signing mechanism. Apologies for the earlier
misunderstanding, I was reading from a limited description and it didn't
make the purpose clear. I've since used
 as my
reference which is a lot clearer. I think it's a good idea, and I'll
definitely support it in my MulitBit Merchant project, but it currently
seems to need more work so I think should be deferred into a dedicated BIP.

@_author: Gary Rowe 
@_subject: [Bitcoin-development]  BIP 20 Rejected, process for BIP 21N 
Regarding the decimal vs satoshi notation I see a few problems with satoshi:
* readability - humans reading the URI would expect it to accurately
reflect what is being displayed (subject to internationalisation issues)
For example, amount=1.234 is more human readable than amount=123400000 (ish)
* backwards compatibility - existing software already uses the decimal
* forwards compatibility - Bitcoin needs to move beyond the satoshi to 20
dps for some reason, this remains OK within the existing schema, but forces
decimals into the satoshi scheme
* simplicity - dual decimal/satoshi variants should be discouraged under
the "single representation" approach
It's relatively straightforward to convert a string encoded decimal into an
internal integer for currency calculations just by applying a multiplying
factor. One never uses doubles or floats for money.

Andreas has a good point. See RFC 3986 on URI schemes:
The colon is a reserved general delimiter (similar in use to the / in a
typical URL, but applies to URNs etc). As suggested, we get req:something
being changed to one of the unreserved characters that do not have to be
URL encoded. Again, from the RFC these are
* Option A: req_something (underscore)
* Option B: req-something (hyphen)
* Option C: req~something (tilde)
* Option D: req.something (period)
Personally, my eye likes Option B, the hyphen.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Random order for clients page 
Although I can only speak for my involvement with MultiBit, the idea of a
randomised client page seems wrong to me, for the reasons given by Alan
Equally, in order to further the idea that Bitcoin is more than the
reference client, it is appropriate that other clients are acknowledged and
promoted. Bitcoin.org has by far the most traffic and by directing people
to other clients that may be more suitable to their needs the user
experience is improved considerably. After all, not everyone wants a 2.5Gb+
download before starting out on their Bitcoin adventure.
If the reference client was the best of all possible worlds then there
would be no need for the alternative clients.

I'm sure that there are many but my Google Search-Fu is not strong enough
to build a query to identify how widespread they are.
Maybe once we have sufficient evidence to support the suspicion we should
post to the main developer forum asking for a cleanup. After all, a Bitcoin
URI starting bitcoin:// doesn't actually make much sense because
there is no hierarchy in Bitcoin - it's flat with only an address being a
mandatory element.
I don't want to be all anal about this, but looking at RFC 3986  (
 it's pretty clear that
introducing a false hierarchy is breaking the specification since it
presumes the existence of a relative URI.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Electrum security model concerns 
Just to chime in on the MultiBit Merchant aspect. The architecture is that
MBM is a Java backend, but executes as a simple command line:
java -jar mbm.jar server config.yml
As Mike expects, MBM offers a RESTful API using HAL+JSON. It provides a
comprehensive set of order and invoice processing, accounting,
inventory/delivery management and customer account handling facilities for
use with a wide variety of online business models.
There will be a variety of front ends, one of which is an online shop. They
also have the same startup command structure.
Since most folks are shy of using any technology, it is likely that MBM+ will be offered as part of a SaaS type solution. This allows anyone
who doesn't have the knowledge to configure it for themselves to make use
of it.
MBM will use BitcoinJ and will depend on a bucket of public keys for
transactions until the HD support is in place to allow generation of public
keys without private keys being present. This removes the need for private
keys to be present on the servers, and allows consumers of the SaaS model
to provide their own transaction keys.
The code is released under MIT license so anyone, anywhere can use it to
build the Bitcoin economy.

Many people that I have introduced Bitcoin to have balked at the massive

A currency lives or dies by network effects. If we can provide the average
low-tech user with a great client experience right from the word go then we
can win them over quickly. Once that is accomplished then more techie users
will likely go on to use a full node which will continue to strengthen the
network overall.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] BIP0039: Final call 
MultiBit here.
We'll be using the BIP39 implementation present in Bitcoinj as slush says.
We generate the word list internally (12,18,24) and confirm it is entered
correctly through a retyping operation. This will allow us to detect
character encoding transpositions (e.g. u0032 vs u00a0) and alert the user
before it becomes an issue.
While English is the language of the first word list to be implemented, we
would definitely integrate alternative non-English word lists to make life
easier for the global community. In general the approach would be for the
user to select their language (implying a locale) and then the word list to
be selected from that locale if available with a fallback to English. This
follows the same approach as resource bundles in Java.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Multisign payment protocol? 
Speaking from the MultiBit perspective, all future protocol development
(with the exception of critical security and network compatibility fixes)
will be put into a HD wallet. Over time we want to see "MultiBit Classic"
gracefully retire and be fully superseded.
Right now, HD is not out there but there is a lot of work going on between
wallet developers to harmonise on HD implementation through BIP32/39. The
result of that work should see a significant migration away from random
private keys.
Thus it would appear likely that by the time this protocol sees widespread
use the presence of HD is likely to be rising fast or possibly dominant.
At MultiBit we anticipate a release of HD code within 2 months, with
private beta occurring within weeks. Trezor and Electrum may be earlier
than this. As far as I am aware both Hive and Haskoin are committed to HD.
If anyone wants early access to the alpha code, let me know and I'll make
the arrangements.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] [RFC] Proposal: Base58 encoded HD Wallet 
Jean-Paul, it may be worth noting that the BIP39 word list is integrated
into Bitcoinj so will likely become the de facto standard for Android,
Trezor web and several desktop wallets. Anyone deviating from that word
list would likely find themselves in an isolated pocket.
Regarding the timestamp, MultiBit HD uses a simple timestamp of "number of
days since midnight of Bitcoin genesis block in UTC with modulo 97 checksum
appended". Thus a new seed generated on 27 January 2014 would have
"1850/01" as its checksum. When creating a new wallet the users are tested
that they have written the timestamp down along with the associated
12/18/24 words.
Modulo 97 was chosen since it catches about 99% of errors.

This is purely a MultiBit HD thing. Nothing to do with the BIP, unless the
wider community felt that it would be generally useful.
It has nothing to do with internal word list checking and is purely an
additional check to reduce the blockchain search load for SPV clients when
restoring wallets.
