I have an idea for a gamified bitcoin mining app that I'd like to partner
with someone on that is very good with cryptography and knows the bitcoin
code base well. I have received interest in this from some, but I'm looking
for the ideal candidate to work with. If this is of interest, please email
me at nharan81 at gmail.com.

My apologies Lauri!
Here is the idea:
I want to build a massive rock paper scissors tournament, the largest the
world has ever seen and one that no one can stop. I imagine re-purposing
bitcoin-qt to do this.
Imagine a tournament like the World Series of Poker, but for RPS.
Each person plays a best of 5 tournament each round. The players are
randomly matched against each other. The number of rounds would effectively
be the depth of a binary tree...
So if a million people play in this tournament, you would need to win 20
rounds to win the tournament and the cash prize.
Now, I will supply this cash prize and I have media connections to get
coverage for this. I fully believe I could get millions playing in this.
