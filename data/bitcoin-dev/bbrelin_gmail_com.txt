@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Looking for a good bitcoin script decompiler 
Hi all,
I'm trying to find a good python script that will take the hash of the
locking and
unlocking tx scripts and output the actual op codes.
Any ideas where to look?

I'm sorry.  Are you a federal prosecutor? or a state prosecutor? Or
involved with law enforcement in any way?
Or involved in a civil suit against Mr. Todd?
The "community" doesn't deserve anything in this regard.  The appropriate
response to your questions is:  "F*** off".

Hi all,
I got a message saying that my membership in the list was disabled due to
excessive bounces.  As far as I can remember,  I've only ever sent out one
e-mail on the list (not including this one) and that was a few weeks ago.
Has anyone else seen this problem?  Could this be related in some way to
the issues regarding source forge and the mail list hosting issue?

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Question regarding transactions with 
Hi all,
When a transaction with N_LOCKTIME>0 is created, does that transaction get
stored in a block on the blockchain or is it stored in the mempool until
the actual time (or block number) exceeds the current value?  If it is
stored on the blockchain, how does that affect the concept of pruning that
is supposed to be going in to version 0.11?  I.e. if I create a transaction
that doesn't take effect for 10 years, and that transaction is stored in a
block, does that block stay on the active list for that period of time?

So, basically it sounds as though the wallet generating the transaction is
what is responsible for holding on to the transaction and then
only releasing it to the network when the NLOCKTIME value is less than or
equal to the current time.  Does that sound right?

How is this being pigheaded? In my opinion, this is leadership.  If
*something* isn't implemented soon, the network is going to have some real
problems, right at the
time when adoption is starting to accelerate.  I've been seeing nothing but
navel-gazing and circlejerks on this issue for weeks now.  Gavin or Mike or
someone at some
point needs to step up and say "follow me".
