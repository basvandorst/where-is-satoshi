@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Where do I start? 
Background: I'm a CS student quickly approaching his research project, and
I'd like to do something meaningful with it.
Essentially, I'd like to know what issues someone up for their bachelor's
degree might actually be able to help on, and where I can start. Obviously
I'm not going to be able to just dive into a 6-year-running project without
some prior research, so I'm looking for a start.
What are some current things that are lacking in Bitcoin core? Or am I
better off making something else for the ecosystem?

Also, can we try to get a wiki page for the debate? That way we could
condense the information as much as possible. I'll be willing to assist if
the page gets approval.

I don't have permission to create a page. If someone else does, I'll
happily get a framework started.

Yeah. We made a git repo instead, so we don't have to bother with the
exclusive-by-default wiki policies. It's linked in this email chain.
I'll be getting home tomorrow, so I should be able to start back up on
this. A few days from now we should throw this on /r/Bitcoin so we can get
some more public comment on it. They already gave me a few leads to chase.

Please use the one it's originally forked from that Ethan made. I don't
want to be the one who sorts through what's valid and what isn't, as I
don't have as low-level an understanding as I'd like. I don't feel

Nothing to apologize for. And yes, that's the correct one.

Just pushed the template for Arguments 3, 4, 6, and a full Argument 2.
Argument 5 should be pro, but is currently not defined. Argument 6 may be
merged with Argument 4 if you think that's necessary.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Proposed additional options for pruned nodes 
There's been a lot of talk in the rest of the community about how the 20MB
step would increase storage needs, and that switching to pruned nodes
(partially) would reduce network security. I think I may have a solution.
There could be a hybrid option in nodes. Selecting this would do the
Flip the --no-wallet toggle
Select a section of the blockchain to store fully (percentage based,
possibly on hash % sections?)
Begin pruning all sections not included in 2
The idea is that you can implement it similar to how a Koorde is done, in
that the network will decide which sections it retrieves. So if the user
prompts it to store 50% of the blockchain, it would look at its peers, and
at their peers (if secure), and choose the least-occurring options from
This would allow them to continue validating all transactions, and still
store a full copy, just distributed among many nodes. It should overall
have little impact on security (unless I'm mistaken), and it would
significantly reduce storage needs on a node.
It would also allow for a retroactive --max-size flag, where it will prune
until it is at the specified size, and continue to prune over time, while
keeping to the sections defined by the network.
What sort of side effects or network vulnerabilities would this introduce?
I know some said it wouldn't be Sybil resistant, but how would this be less
so than a fully pruned node?

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Proposed additional options for pruned 
Yes, but that just increases the incentive for partially-full nodes. It
would add to the assumed-small number of full nodes.
Or am I misunderstanding?

0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 can be solved by looking at chunks chronologically. Ie,
give the signed (by sender) hash of the first and last block in your range.
This is less data dense than the idea above, but it might work better.
That said, this is likely a less secure way to do it. To improve upon that,
a node could request a block of random height within that range and verify
it, but that violates point 2. And the scheme in itself definitely violates
point 7.

Yet this holds true in our current assumptions of the network as well: that
it will become a collection of pruned nodes with a few storage nodes.
A hybrid option makes this better, because it spreads the risk, rather than
concentrating it in full nodes.

I suppose this begs two questions:
1) why not have a partial archive store the most recent X% of the
blockchain by default?
2) why not include some sort of torrent in QT, to mitigate this risk? I
don't think this is necessarily a good idea, but I'd like to hear the

This is exactly the sort of solution I was hoping for. It seems this is the
minimal modification to make it work, and, if someone was willing to work
with me, I would love to help implement this.
My only concern would be if the - - max-size flag is not included than this
delivers significantly less benefit to the end user. Still a good chunk,
but possibly not enough.

But don't you see the same trade-off in the end there? You're still
propagating the same amount of data over the same amount of time, so unless
I misunderstand, the costs of such a move should be approximately the same,
just in different areas. The risks as I understand are as follows:
   1. Longer per-block propagation (eventually)
   2. Longer processing time (eventually)
   3. Longer sync time
1 Minute:
   1. Weaker individual confirmations (approx. equal per confirmation*time)
   2. Higher orphan rate (immediately)
   3. Longer sync time
That risk-set makes me want a middle-ground approach. Something where the
immediate consequences aren't all that strong, and where we have some idea
of what to do in the future. Is there any chance we can get decent network
simulations at various configurations (5MB/4min, etc)? Perhaps
re-appropriate the testnet?

Sync time wouldn't be longer compared to 20MB, it would (eventually) be
longer under either setup.
Also, and this is probably a silly concern, but wouldn't changing block
time change the supply curve? If we cut the rate in half or a power of two,
that affects nothing, but if we want to keep it in round numbers, we need
to do it by 10, 5, or 2. I feel like most people would bank for 10 or 5,
both of which change the supply curve due to truncation.
Again, it's a trivial concern, but probably one that should be addressed.
