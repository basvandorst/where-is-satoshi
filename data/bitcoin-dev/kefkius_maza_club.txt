I have a potential BIP, "Multi-Currency Hierarchy For Use In
Multisignature Deterministic Wallets." I'm requesting discussion on it,
and possibly assignment of a BIP number.
It's located in this github gist:

I've amended the proposal's "Motivation" section slightly for
clarification. I'm not sure how a "cosigner_index" branch would benefit
this proposal. Granted, I don't fully understand the benefits of the
"cosigner_index" branch in BIP-0045. From what I understand, the
"wallet" branch of my proposal seems to accomplish a similar goal.
Your explanation is correct. As for this being appropriate as a BIP, I
agree that it's an arguable point to say it improves Bitcoin. However,
this proposal exists because of BIP-0044, which also describes a
multi-currency hierarchy. For that reason, I think this is an
appropriate proposal.
Thank you both for your feedback.

I'm re-submitting this after a little under a year because, though it
generated little discussion, I feel it is still necessary.

  BIP: bip-kefkius-multicoin-multisig
  Title: Multi-Currency Hierarchy For Use In Multisignature
Deterministic Wallets
  Author: Tyler Willis   Status: Draft
  Type: Standards Track
 Abstract This BIP defines a hierarchy based on BIP-0044 for deterministic wallets
intended to facilitate multi-currency, multisignature wallet management.
This BIP is an application of BIP-0043.
 Motivation The hierarchy defined in BIP-0044 places a coin's type level above the
level designating account number. This limits the possible
implementations of multi-currency, multisignature wallets. The hierarchy
defined here facilitates the creation of wallets intended to be both
multi-currency and multisignature.
 Specification  Path Levels m / purpose' / wallet' / coin_type / change / address_index
 Purpose Purpose is a constant tentatively set to
`bip-kefkius-multicoin-multisig` as there is no BIP number assigned to
this proposal. Hardened derivation is used here.
 Wallet This level is incremented for every wallet that one makes. Much like the
account node in BIP-0044, this is intended to organize independent
identities within the key space.
Basically, each index in this level represents a group of cosigners.
Hardened derivation is used here.
 Coin Type This is the BIP-0044 index of the coin being managed. Public derivation
is used here.
Public derivation is used so that cosigners need only know one of each
other's public keys, rather than needing to distribute public keys for
each coin.
 Change 0 is used for public addresses and 1 is used for change addresses.
Identical to BIP-0044 behavior. Public derivation is used here.
 Address Index The address index. This increases sequentially as it does in BIP-0044.
Public derivation is used here.
