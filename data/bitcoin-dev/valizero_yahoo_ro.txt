If you want to write such baseless acusations and inflamatory phrases, please do it somewhere else. We should have the highest respect for what these people are doing, and we should try to do something constructive, not waste time with anger and disrespect.
Nobody should be forced to do anything. People like you will not force me or anyone else to run code for your controversial hard fork just because you think the future will be bright with huge blocks. Just like the developers will not force you to continue running code implementing the current consensus rules.
The developers are not telling you what to do, they are trying to do what they consider is best for the ecosystem given their technical abilities.

 You mean
 the bunch of self-proclaimed Bitcoin wizards, who decided
 they have the right to tell everybody what to do, and who
 never got to grow up and are now angry at the world for not
 listening to them anymore? That "technical
 consensus"?
 "Bitcoin is decentralized, but you are
 only allowed to do what we tell you to do. It's our pet
 project, we wrote code for it!"
 That's what it all boils down to, all these
 dirty games of calling XT an alt-coin and censoring its
 posts, pretending to be Satoshi, sabotaging XT switch, etc.:
 "How dare they not listen to Us The Smartest
 anymore?!!!"
 Pathetic.
 The history will roll over you in a blink. The harder you
 try, the quicker it will go.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Personal opinion on the fee market from a worried 
I have been reading an argument saying that paying higher fees would scare Bitcoin users and they would stop using it, preferring bank transfers or other payment methods. This does not make sense for me. If some users leave, then demand for bitcoin transactions goes down and so do the fees. The others remain.
Fee market means that an equilibrium is found between the demand for bitcoin transactions and the available supply (given by the block size). The fee is the price that finds this equilibrium.
If a fee market starts to exist, the first ones to leave are the spammers, probably followed by the gamblers and perhaps people transacting very low amounts. The people that actually need Bitcoin would remain.
Please allow this fee market to form...
In the absence of a functioning fee market, I will refuse to run Bitcoin code that increases the block size and will do my best to tell everyone I know not to upgrade towards running such code. If Bitcoin succombs to the free stuff army, I will sell all the coins and leave. Nothing is for free.
I apologize for any exagerations, but I just felt strongly towards expressing my opinion here. I'm only a local Bitcoin trader, computer engineer, with a reasonable understanding of free markets. And I'm running only one full node.
Kind regards,

I am disappointed that you did not understand my point of view. Let me rephrase it for you,
People tipping, buying 0.99$ products and gamblers that need Bitcoin transactions *more* than the rest of the people will afford the fees that establish the equilibrium between demand and supply of Bitcoin transactions. The people are free to use they money for whatever they like, but you should understand that Bitcoin transactions are not free.
I was merely attempting to point out that spammers and gamblers would be the first ones that would go away. They would be free to spam or gamble, but they would have to pay for it.
When a category of users would get priced out because of the fee market, they would be free to use any altcoin they want.
Please understand that not everyone will leave. The more important players will remain, those that need it the most. The other players are free to use whatever altcoin they wish.

so people tipping, buying $0.99 products, and gamblers actually don't need Bitcoin.
Who are you to say what people need to use money for?This statement goes against the freedom of decentralization and financial freedom Bitcoin should be able to provide.
It's an open network and it will be used as most users see fit, and that requires a blocksize increase wether you like it or not, it's simple physics, other time wait times will become unbearable for those not willing to pay the high fees, if people leave, then it only mean bitcoins isn't useful, and if bitcoin isn't useful, it's worthless.
