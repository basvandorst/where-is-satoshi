Hi all, I'm looking to help with Bitcoin core development in my spare time
(a few hours per week).
A little bit about me:
* I use C++ and Qt daily
* I love to automate and enhance software systems
* I enjoy root causing and fixing issues
I saw Gavin say we needed help with testing in a Reddit AMA a while ago.
I'm curious where I can make the best impact. Any feedback would be
appreciated. Thanks!

Thanks Jeff. I'll start looking there.

I've started to familiarize myself with the source code and build tools.
I'll be posting regular status updates on my blog (linked below) for others
to follow getting started with bitcoin development.
A tally from August indicated that I may need to slog through 280,000 lines
of code to get up to speed. I sampled
 and skimmed it
in about 5 minutes, putting me at 2600 lines per hour. At that rate, I
would need to devote 110 hours to read the entire code base.
With that time investment I could get a fair amount of testing done, so I'm
curious if we have a map of the most important areas to study for new
developers and automated test writers.
Thanks for your time,
Will Bickford

Gotcha. That's much more manageable. Thanks!
