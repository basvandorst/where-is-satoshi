First off, nice article. Very clear and informative.
I don't know if this is the best place to post this, but it seems related
to me.
As more wallets implement BIP32, I believe that bitcoin wallets should
begin to encourage people to use
address instead of traditional addresses. In the end, this would
improve privacy because users never need to merge coin if they had one of
these "super addresses".
In addition, "super addresses" would fit nicely into BIP70. Right now, the
PaymentDetails message allows the merchant to provide multiple outputs. If
instead the PaymentDetails provide 1 traditional output (for reverse
compatibility) and 1 "super address", the payment could be broken into as
many pieces as is needed to match unspent outputs already in the customers
wallet. Finally, the refund_to address in Payment could also be upgraded to
a "super address" to enhance privacy there.
I am not sure if there is a large memory requirement for "super addresses",
but to me, it seems that a lot of these privacy enhancing possibilities
will be simple to implement once BIP32 is widely deployed.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Chain pruning 
You say UTXO commitments is "a strict reduction in security". If UTXO
commitments were rolled in as a soft fork, I do not see any new attacks
that could happen to a person trusting the committed UTXO + any remaining
blocks to catch up to the head.
I would imagine the soft fork to proceed similar to the following.
1. Miners begin including UTXO commitments.
2. Miners begin rejecting blocks with invalid UTXO commitments.
3. Miners begin rejecting blocks with no UTXO commitments.
To start up a fresh client it would follow the following.
1. Sync headers.
2. Pick a committed UTXO that is deep enough to not get orphaned.
3. Sync blocks from commitment to head.
I would argue that a client following this methodology is strictly more
secure than SPV, and I don't see any attacks that make it less secure than
a full client. It is obviously still susceptible to a 51% attack, but so is
the traditional block chain. I also do not see any sybil attacks that are
strengthened by this change because it is not modifying the networking code.
I guess if the soft fork happened, then miners began to not include the
UTXO commitment anymore, it would lower the overall network hash rate, but
this would be self-harming to the miners so they have an incentive to not
do it.
Please let me know if I have missed something.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Reconsidering github 
I want go give a bit of an outsiders perspective. I thoroughly understand
the concepts of bitcoin and am a professional programmer, but have never
taken the time to compile my own copy of bitcoin core.
I have looked at the pull requests on Github many times. I have cloned the
repo to my own computer, but haven't really used that to do much. I find
Github very easy to use, and (to me) it has the lowest bar to get more eyes
passively looking at the code. As a security guy, I appreciate the extra
time and effort that goes into signing commits and merges even if I have
not personally verified the signatures. I would like to see bitcoin core
continue to use github, but have no objection to additional mirrors of the
repo being hosted on different sites.
