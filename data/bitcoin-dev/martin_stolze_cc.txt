Hi Team,
I would like to find out what the current consensus on transaction tiering is.
Background: The current protocol enables two parties to transact
freely, however, transaction processors (block generators) have the
authority to discriminate participants arbitrarily. This is well known
and it is widely accepted that transaction processors may take
advantage of this with little recourse. It is the current consensus
that the economic incentives in form of transaction fees are
sufficient because the transaction processing authorities are assumed
to be guided by the growth of Bitcoin and the pursuit of profit.
We can establish that a transaction processing authority does not need
to actually process transactions and reigns sovereign over the block
space they govern. [1] For further discussion I will refer to a
transaction processor more aptly as "Block Space Authority" (BSA).
Currently, a user can only signal to all BSA?s (via the mempool) its
desire to include her transaction into the ledger. A user can not
signal to specific BSA?s, and thus, can not easily carry out business
in jurisdictions that conform to the users understanding of best
As a participant in the economy in general and of Bitcoin in
particular, I desire an ability to decide where I transact. The
current state of Bitcoin does not allow me to choose my place of
business. As a consequence, I try to learn what would be the best way
to conduct my business in good faith. [2]
I have certain minimum requirements towards the constitution of the
block space like transparency, forward guidance and risk management.
More poignantly, it could also include due diligence to ensure that
child labor is not involved in the maintenance of a specific block
space, or that the specific block space does not utilize nuclear
energy or sources at least 80% of the expended energy from solar
power. Obviously, preferences can vary widely.
I don?t think there is any way to discard the desire of users to
choose their place of business, especially under the consideration
that BSA?s have the discretion to choose users transactions already.
I have identified the following options along the lines of Lawrence
Lessig's concept of Cyberspace: [3]
1. Law: Bilateral Agreement
Users engage directly with BSA?s to process their transaction.
Transactions are routed around the mempool. A likely outcome of this
solution is the emergence of brokers that sell off block space in a
sort of secondary market. Wallets may negotiate on behalf of their
users. This model has obvious downsides as it involves new middlemen,
increases transaction cost beyond the current market price
(speculation) and potentially reduces performance.
2. Architecture: Remove transaction fees
If only the block reward functions to incentivise transaction
processing, no differentiation is useful. However, spam/empty blocks
could not be prevented and Bitcoin would have to be entirely
redesigned, potentially losing its censorship resistance.
3. Market: Direct Communication
Through the core client, BSA?s can offer individual mempools that
users can choose to advertise their transactions to. Different BSA?s
could receive different transaction fees for the same transaction in
their respective mempool to reflect the preference of the user.
In Conclusion: In the long term, it is likely that a clearer
differentiation of BSA?s will become important. Today, BSA?s
communicate rarely and it appears that their raison d'etre is not
necessarily motivated by good faith towards Bitcoin as a whole. [4] As
we move forward it is not just important to attract opportunistic
players that win an individual game but good players that are invited
to play again in order to win a set of all possible games.
BSA?s establish their authority on cheap access to capital in the form
of electricity and hardware and the consent and trust of users who
expect BSA's to respect and maintain the ledgers integrity.
In 3 to 8 years, when Bitcoin leaves it?s bootstrapping phase, the
incentives will squarely fall on the later. [5] Subsequently it seems
prudent to allow BSA?s to compete for business on other factors than
Hence my question: What is the current stance of core developers
regarding the facilitation of direct communication between users and
BSA?s, possibly through a transaction tiering model?

Hi Tim,
After writing this I figured that it was probably not evident at first
sight as the concept may be quite novel. The physical location of the
"miner" is indeed irrelevant, I am referring to the digital location.
Bitcoins blockchain is a digital location or better digital "space".
As far as I am concerned the authority lies with whoever governs this
particular block space. A "miner" can, or can not, include my
To make this more understandable:
Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi can extend his caliphate into Bitcoins block
space and rule sovereign(!) over a given block. If he processes my
transaction my fee goes directly into the coffers of his organization.
The same goes for the Queen of England or the Emperor of China. My
interest is not necessarily aligned with each specific authority, yet
as you point out, I can only not use Bitcoin.
Alternatively, however, I can very well sign my transaction and send
it to an authority of my choosing to be included into the ledger, say
BitFurry. - This is what I describe in option 1.
In order to protect my interest I do need to choose, maybe not today,
but eventually.
I also think that people do care who processes transactions and a lot
of bickering could be spared if we could choose.
If we assume a perfectly competitive market with 3 authorities that
govern the block space equally, the marginal cost of 1/3 of the block
space is the same for each, however, the marginal revenue absent of
block rewards is dependent on fees.
If people are willing to pay only a zero fee to a specific authority
while a fee greater than zero to the others it's clear that one would
be less competitive.
Let us assume the fees are 10% of the revenue and the cost is 95 we
have currently the following situation:
A: Cost=95; Revenue=100; Profit=5
B: Cost=95; Revenue=100; Profit=5
C: Cost=95; Revenue=100; Profit=5
With transaction tiering, the outcome could be different!
A: Cost=95; Revenue=90; Loss=5 // BSA that does not respect user interest.
B: Cost=95; Revenue=105; Profit=10
C: Cost=95; Revenue=105; Profit=10
This could motivate transaction processors to behave in accordance
with user interest, or am I missing something?
Best Regards,

Thanks, those are valid concerns.
That is the idea. Transaction Processors could source transactions
from the public mempool as well their proprietary mempool(s).
Not so, a user may want to incentivise a specific Transaction
Processor or many. A user can detect this behavior and withdraw his
future business if he notices that his transaction is not included in
a block despite there being transactions with lower fees included.
Remember, the transaction can be advertised to different mempools and
a Transaction Processor could lose this business to a competitor who
processes the next block if he holds it back.
Best Regards
PS: It seems not too late to get rid of misleading terms like "miner".
Block rewards (infrastructure subsidies) will be neglectable for
future generations and the analogy is exceedingly poor.

Yes, the terminology is creating a lot of confusion. I would be happy to
contribute to a discourse that helps to clear up the ambiguities and
cringeworthiness of current "standardized terminology".
Robert Keagen developed a perspective on psychological development [1] and
it appears to me that Stage 2 and 3 (miner, cash, network upgrade, ...) is
discussing with Stage 4 (hash power, settlement, fork, ...).
"Miner" is not wrong, just not helpful if you try to gauge the deeper
complexities of Bitcoin. Likewise, "money" is not wrong if you explain it
to a child, while credit and debt is much more useful if you want to gauge
the deeper complexities of economics.
still, any form forking has dilutive effect on existing BTC holders.
Not at all, I sleep sound and anticipate any such event as an ugly scrip

Yes, absolutely. It would still be helpful if it is somewhat
standardized on the Client level.
I agree and I really appreciate the explanation! Transaction Processor
is not optimal, I brought up BSA: Block Space Authority before to
slice the pie in terms of it legitimate power structure instead of its
functionality. I maintain that this is better for higher level
discourse. Maybe something like "Consensus Space Sovereign" would be
more suitable.
Functionally, a node can moderate the network in the following way:
1. Relay transactions (mempool) and the global memory (blockchain)
2. Construct block headers (PoW: deterministic diffusion puzzle
solutions) and write to the global memory (create "blocks", which are
"ledger change candidates")
3. Read, verify and accept changes to the global memory
"Block Generator" (ala Satoshi) may be better but let's look at the
power structure analog to the functionality:
1. Authority to propose a change
2. Authority to approve a change
3. Authority to reject a change
This can easily be understood in current political terms. In Spain a:
1. Citizen can propose to engage in a business (voice)
2. (Special) Citizen (the King) can disapprove of the business (sovereign)
3. Citizen can leave Spain (exit)
Likewise, citizens can engage with the sovereign in order to change
some regulation, say average transaction tax. The question is simply
what legitimate authority a node has. We can map that quite neatly
onto the terminology of 'Politics'.
That does also away with naive 51% attack scenarios and the like. They
are akin to aliens invading earth. Surely it is not impossible that
aliens invade and in Bitcoin land, it is currently conceivable, but
most conflicts are not brought about by a single devilish aggressor
but a special interest group that wants to concentrate benefits and
diffuse costs.
- Transaction Tiering could be a great basis for decentralized negotiations.

Hi AJ,
That's outstanding. I am glad to see that there is actually somebody
who has made some progress.
Great idea! Block space as a resource is under-analyzed.
I am not joking when I say that in 3 to 8 years, I want to be able to
verify my transaction through green blocks that are generated locally
by my neighbor through the excess capacity of his solar panels or by
an NGO pool that promotes solar deployment around the equator.
Yes, just selecting all SegWit signaling hash power instead of picking
individual Authorities would be helpful on preferredminer.com
Absolutely, considering the recent language used in opinions by the
ECB and drafts by the EU I see them assembling the artillery. I
wouldn't be surprised if they start target practice next year. That
will mean that commercial interest must have a way to transact on
somewhat regulated space.
I would call it regulated block space or regulated consensus space. I
hope that we can do that on a deeper level, as part of the p2p
protocol layer.
That's a distinct function, e.g. at least some communities charge a tax. [1]
I fear it is more likely that a business, say Coinbase, will approach
a "miner" and just say "we pay 100 USD for a KB to your bank account,
here are our transactions with no fee". It will literally be an
off-chain fee. That's what I mean by "secondary market". This would be
one of the least appealing scenarios.
Spot on, that's why this should receive some attention before it
becomes urgent. I think there is much more to it that we are missing
at the moment, e.g. Tom: "Using xthin/compact blocks miners only send
a tiny version of a block which then causes the receiving node to
re-create it using the memory pool."

As I alluded to before, certain language lends itself to simple conclusions.
You say that "miner" have simple profit motives and compete only in
their respective domains. But what is "mining"?
It is the process of acquiring a part of the block space. He who
acquires that space can decide over this particular space. (1) Your
entire theory falls apart at the point of an empty block. (2) "The
pursuit of profit can come at the expense of Bitcoin:"
( (3) Bitcoin
has additional value, like a brand value that could be diverted.
- The market can be gamed for profit. Really.
I fall back on Carl Schmitt according to which the sovereign is he who
decides on the state of exception: If there is some person or
institution, in a given polity, capable of bringing about a total
suspension of the law and then to use extra-legal force to normalize
the situation, then that person or institution is the sovereign in
that polity.
- That is spot on, I don't know why the rest of the political theory
shouldn't apply.
I didn't think of that, but you are right. The problem is just that it
didn't just give them the impression that they have authority, it
actually transferred the authority.
Again: "The question is simply what legitimate authority a node has."
- You gave legitimacy to their authority! Core did!
(Conversely, the intelligence service of some dictatorship may get
enough hash power to claim authority over the block space, however,
this would have zero legitimacy and could easily be dealt with.)
miner signaling ... just "miner", right?
Thanks for helping me understand.

Ignoring your contradiction of the political and economical. Your
conception holds under the presupposition that all action of
hash-power is motivated by 'rational' economic interest. Specifically
a very strict distinction between the profitable and the unprofitable;
namely to include transactions based on "business incentive",
presumably on-chain fees.
I am afraid that this conception is a rickety crutch, unfit to
navigate current reality.

Sure it will be somewhat controversial initially, however, "miners",
will have additional incentive to listen to the network in order to
get transactions. It's not taking away from your personal choice, it's
adding additional choice to those that are disenfranchised by
hash-power centralization.
