I've been pushing for the Bitcoin Stack-Exchange as our main
user/merchant support site:
I think the Stack Exchange format is ideal, since the
acceptable/unacceptable topics are defined in advance, and it has a good
user moderation/reputation system.  The site will be for technical and
conceptual questions only, no politics or philosophy, and obviously no
buying and selling.  This makes it unattractive to the kooks and
hucksters, and therefore unattractive to the trolls as well.
At the time of this writing, we still need 64 more people to commit to
using the site before it will launch, 48 of which need to be established
Stack Exchange users.  At the rate we've been going, the site should be
up around the end of August.  I'd like to make it happen before then, so
please join up!

Could we just get the forum link removed entirely?  The current Google
search link does very little to disassociate the forum from the Bitcoin
project.  There's no need to have a forum link anyway, as there's
already a link to the wiki, which links to the forum, and can be edited
to link to other unofficial forums as well.
I just came across a thread by someone offering to sell a bitcoin mining
I know there'd been complaints about illegal activity, but this is a
whole new level of bad PR compared to people just offering to sell
drugs.  Especially when there are responses like:
"Excuse me while I put this on every computer at my school."
"This would be so awesome if I could install it at every computer in my
college lab. So many bitcoins for me."
It doesn't just look like some one-off cybercriminal spam, it looks like
forum members in general support this kind of thing.
