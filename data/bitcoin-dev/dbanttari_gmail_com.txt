I posted some code on Reddit a while back around adding a simple x509
digital signature to a Bitcoin address URL, since you could gain the
benefit of an x.509 authenticated Bitcoin address without having to do a
full BIP70 implementation.  It's not WoT, but x509, for all its flaws,
works very well in the real world almost all of the time.
For added authentication, one could always wrap the URL with a PGP
After lurking on this list for a while, I assumed there's some reason this
hasn't already been implemented, likely based in the general disgust around
Anyway, here's my idea (complete with working Java source):

What about BIP 420?  Everyone knows if you add zero it's still the same

Thank you for taking the time to look at my proposal.
1) pay to addresses are not fixed - ie you can have a different address for
This is certainly true for a "published" address; however a new address
(and URL) can be generated for each one-off peer-to-peer transaction.
 However, I'd expect that most of the time this use case will be handed by
BIP70.  Still, this could allow someone to implement a authenticated,
non-repudiable payment request without having to go through the hassle of a
full BIP70 implementation.
My proposal leverages the existing SSL key system (yes, PKI), so there is a
reasonable expectation that if the signature verifies, it came from the
party indicated on the cert.  While SSL (and the PKI system underpinning
it) have its faults, the example you highlighted was specifically a problem
with WoT, not PKI.  Can a compromised web server cause payments to be made
to the wrong party?  Of course-- but that's already true.  And that's not
something BIP70 solves (or attempts to solve) either.
(To explain [better than I could] why I feel PKI is a pragmatic solution, I
defer to Mike Hearn 's article:
