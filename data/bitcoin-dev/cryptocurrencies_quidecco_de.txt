Hi there,
Using the same set of nodes for posting transactions using unrelated
inputs kind of limits the privacy improvement that can be gained from
using unrelated inputs in the first place.
Similar to how Tor uses different circuits for different hosts to
connect to, it may make more sense to only use the same set of nodes
for posting a subsequent transaction when the input addresses are also
the same.
I also find the topic of banning Tor exit nodes interesting.
I wonder if it makes more sense not to ban IP addresses completely,
but instead to throttle them using a PoW-based access control
scheme. Misbehaving addresses can have their connecting difficulty
scaled up, which should make it uneconomic to try to DoS the usage of
Tor exit nodes for connecting to Bitcoin.
It may also help nodes behind a NAT router if they share their global
IP with misconfigured nodes.

Hi Mike,
thanks for your assessment.
Please find my replies in-line:
Since when? This has been a recognized approach since people called it
"hashcash" ([1] - before cryptocurrencies were even invented).
I hear your concerns, but even then, I would see the PoW-based
approach as an improvement to today's situations.
To be clear, I do not propose to have _all_ clients do complicated
work. Just those using an address which has been misbehaving. Right
now, they cannot connect at all, no matter how much resources they
dedicate towards doing so.
The way I had it in mind, well-behaved clients on an address used by
attackers would have more effort to connect because of the PoW, but
after that, they can stay connected. The attacker also has to put more
effort into connecting, and after sending malformed messages, gets
disconnected. So, the attacker would have to perform much more PoW
computations in order to keep up his attack.
Exactly. Not every user may like to have a cookie by which an observer
might get the chance to even link his connection to his previous
connections, thereby allowing the discussed deanonymization technique
to get even more effective.
Maybe having both options would be even better: In case of an attack,
those able to solve the anti-DoS PoW can still connect (just maybe
slower). Those who wish to run a weak client can choose to sacrifice
privacy for connectivity and keep a cookie for connecting.

Hi Gregory,
response below quote:
When you say "running exclusively on Tor", what do you mean exactly?
Do you also connect or allow connections through hidden services?
I made outbound connections through Tor exit points the only way to
connect to Bitcoin, and increased the number of allowed outbound
connection in order to get more meaningful values.
Lately, I could see unusual behaviour at:
* 2014-11-28 13:14 UTC
* 2014-11-25 07:32 UTC
* 2014-11-24 13:06 UTC
Anything I should look into?
I think this issue is more important than it seems.
Firstly, when running Tor-only, there are still attack vectors which
make use of the DoS protection deficiencies.
Secondly, if we tell people not to connect directly if they want
privacy, how do we ensure that these indirect methods will not come
with implications for their privacy?

In order to get more synergy between Bitcoin users of varying skill
levels, my suggestion would be a cleaner separation between technical
mechanisms and policies (possibly suitable for users without technical
Core development would mean providing suitable mechanisms by which it
is possible to run Bitcoin on different constraints. This may include
ways to handle attacks specific to the Tor/Bitcoin combination.
People who like to research what is possible with the protocol can
then experiment on how these mechanisms can be used in order to
mitigate these attacks.
Finally, distributors of consumer wallets can use this research in
order to distribute their wallet with policies which may be less prone
to Tor-specific attacks. Or leave this out altogether if their
audience has different expectations for connecting to Bitcoin.
The tricky part is probably to figure out what is the greatest common
denominator of what keeps Bitcoin stable and running while still
leaving room for customized policies. But I think that separating
concerns like this is better than letting a debate about how to
mitigate certain Tor-related attacks evolve towards a debate about Tor
or not Tor.
I think it would be very interesting to explore alternatives for
Tor. But at this point, completely abandoning Tor would mean that
users either have to agree to have their transactions correlated to
their IP address, or to trust their transactions to a third party
where they are not subject to the security guarantees Bitcoin's
logic can provide anymore. In my opinion, it's a rather huge
What I find interesting, however, is that a lot of suggestions I see
with respect to attacks related to Tor/Bitcoin (including my own)
involve some kind of extra effort required for Tor users on Bitcoin in
order to protect themselves against these attacks. So, it may be
interesting to explore if it is viable to think of Tor's privacy
guarantees as coming for free. Going from there, if it cannot be
guaranteed to work completely for free, the question would be to what
extent the required extra effort should be a shared effort of the
network, and to what extent users requiring the improved privacy
should use their own resources in order to make it possible.

Reimplementing Tor would not only mean to lose all the investment that
ran into Tor, but also to lose a large user base. We can see this with
TorCoin. Still, the fact that Bitcoin is a use case for Tor which
measurably shows some limits where it is not fully clear if Tor or
Bitcoin is to be blamed does not only mean that both projects may
have to evolve in order to properly solve the issue, but also that the
means of interfacing between both projects may have to be
extended. Ideally, in a way which does not require to run a separate
Tor and/or Bitcoin network in order to work, but which will be generic
enough to satisfy both sides' need to still work in a standalone
But I do see huge merit in exploring better ways of synergy between
the projects. For example, Tor's hardcoded circuit length may be
considered as a hack which was only necessary due to the lack of a
suitable resource compensation mechanism. Which is something that is
available with Bitcoin.

When refering to "getting bootstrapped", do you only mean collecting
node addresses, or also syncing blocks?
If you're saying the drops in connection counts are likely to be
not caused by a DoSban attack on the exit nodes, what could be other
reasons to look into?
Great! I find it very interesting to research options for splitting
communication between Tor and non-Tor as long as the introduced
information leakage between both connection methods can be proved to
be nonexistent or negligible.
In the case of Bitcoin, this makes me wonder about an attack that
could look approximately like this:
* Node A connects to Bitcoin using Tor (for submitting transactions)
  and IPv4 (for all other communication).
* Node B strives for direct IPv4 connections with node A
* Node B uses the direct IPv4 connections in order to supply Node A
  with additional peer addresses not supplied to any other nodes
* Node B observes these additional peer addresses
For transactions submitted to the additional peer addresses supplied
by node B, how to prevent that the probability of these originating
from node A is higher than for originating from other nodes?
For handling block propagation using non-Tor connections, it's
probably harder to create information leaks, as the logic for handling
disagreement about blocks is pretty well-researched, meaning that
it's less important where the blocks come from.

Well, as soon as miners learn about the merits of controlling the
blocks' contents, this issue may get solved by the market pressure
of miners expecting this kind of service from their pool.
I mean, the dev community constantly has some level of disagreement
about the best policies for what to include in blocks. But seen from
the perspective of some Bitcoin business or another, certain policies
might be more preferable. So if miners start to understand that they
could take a stake for their favourite Bitcoin businesses by choosing
a mining pool which employs a preferable transaction inclusion policy,
the question would not anymore be "which pool gives me the most
Bitcoins or the lowest variance, regardless of the technical
background", but "which pools does the best for my Bitcoin economy
needs". And this may be a very economically driven decision by itself,
considering that the exchange rates for Bitcoins depend on Bitcoin
businesses doing well.
If we get to this point with respect to user (miner) education, then
it is probably only a matter of time until people start to find it
cumbersome to mine on a black-box pool and having to manually verify
that they still have an agreeable transaction inclusion policy, when
they can just mine on a GBT pool and configure things in their mining
Bear with me, but this piece of rhetorics struck me. Why even mention
those who think it's not harmful, when your next sentence states
that their opinion should be ignored completely?

If something means "giving up on the Bitcoin experiment", then for
sure it's not one mining policy or another, but the assumption
that we should have one uniform mining policy. If we had a community
where enough miners had their own opinion about the best mining
policy, and expressed it by choosing an appropriate mining pool, then
we would have better decentralized mining based on selfish motives of
the miners, rather than based on an abstract thought of
"centralization is bad, so I will consider how much mining profit
from qualitatively interchangable mining pools I'm willing to
sacrifice in order to ease my centralization fears".

Psychological benefit vs. effective benefit involves the danger of
destroying trust in the Bitcoin network when there are hard facts for
non-robustness while the node number looks big. Therefore, it may make
sense to establish better metrics.
In my opinion, the characteristic of being able to make use of
non-dedicated nodes should be regarded as an advantage of the Bitcoin
protocol, and not something to get rid of. Nodes being able to
contribute this way may lead to even more robustness than
decentralization alone, as they can do so without exposing a fixed
address which could be attacked.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Proposal: PoW-based throttling of 
Hi Mike, hi Ivan, hi all,
I think the proposal back then was targeted at e-mail
delivery. Interestingly, one of today's most common approaches
against unsolicited e-mails, DKIM, can also be considered as being a
relative to PoW if we consider that bulk mailer operators don't
like it because of the CPU burden it creates. But with e-mail, people
tend to see it even as an advantage to also have identification of the
participants, so it's no surprise that pure PoW approaches did not
achieve importance.
With cryptocurrencies, it's different. Combating DoS without
creating additional ways to identify users is something where many
interested users can be found.
Humans may have less patience than an attacker who just wants to
achieve his DoS objective in a batch processing manner. But humans
also don't care if their patience is put to the test by having to
wait until one Tor exit node is finally unbanned, or by waiting for
the connection PoW to finish because it temporarily got harder due to
an attack.
No doubt that a dedicated attacker can have an (even big) advantage
resource-wise. But this is no different between the case where both
computing power and the number of Tor exit nodes are the resource to
compete on, and the case where it's just the resource of Tor exit
nodes that gets exhausted. But by giving users the choice of proving
their dedication through a connecting PoW challenge, I would expect
users having more possibilities of finding their way through a
DoS-imposed partial outage. After all, the possibly powerful attacker
has to invest his resources into making all access routes to the
network unusable, while for well-behaved users, every single access
route that still works is useful. Therefore, I think it makes sense to
add more degrees of freedom.
None of these measures are perfect. But I think we can achieve a
solution that is good enough. Hopefully without integrating a
centralized captcha provider ;)
On the one hand, I think that to some extent, the work queue based
throttling just moves the problem from making it hard to connect
towards making it hard to do something useful with your connection.
But as I touched above, I see the merit that comes from the PoW-based
approach in allowing well-behaving users to explore multiple axes of
putting effort into connecting. Expanding on this approach, I think
that the work queue based approach and PoW could be combined, leading
to three measures the nodes can use for throttling misbehaving
* scaling up connection PoW
* throttling the connection on the work queue
* throttling the IP on the work queue
The challenging part would be to properly tune the extent of the three
measures in order to throttle attackers' messages with minimum
impact to well-behaving users.
Sure, but that's a different topic. It may not be even realistic
to have a model which can be reduced to deciding between purposeful
misbehaviour and regular usage. But an attacker who wants to cut off
IPs from the network will always use whatever misbehaviour that leads
to maximum penalty, meaning that it is a decision between not
penalizing at all, or doing so.
I'd say, better have a few Tor-based users realize that they
should look for a fixed update because their client has to do PoW for
connecting, rather than having all Tor-based users locked out.
Still, users should be notified that something is unusual.
Both cookies and Proof of UTXO sound like interesting approaches, but
I still see additional possibilities to deduce information about the
user identity here. They could be a nice addition for a better
approach to handle DoS attacks, but I would disagree when it comes to
only providing possibly privacy-weakening approaches.
I'm looking forward to your comments.

Hello there,
I agree about the severity of the Tor/Bitcoin issue, but I see no
point in bashing Bitcoin's financial privacy characteristics as
the linked pages seem to do.
Bitcoin can be useful as a part of a strategy to improve on privacy,
but it does not intend to be a run-and-forget solution for doing so.
A lot of issues found in this context can actually be traced back to
Tor's characteristics already known before. It's just that
Bitcoin makes Tor's deficiencies more measurable - before Bitcoin,
those interested in researching how Tor performs in an automated
context where a much smaller community. In the end, I guess both
projects can benefit from the research we can do now.
Generally, it cannot be said that the attack vector described here is
irrelevant for non-dual-stack nodes. An attacker might not be able to
collect IP addresses of Tor-only nodes, but he can try to kick the
users from all Tor exit nodes he does not control, and proceed with
other attacks when a large number of Tor-only users connect through
his Tor exit node(s).
Since this attack vector has been discussed, I started making some
measurements on how effective it is to connect to Bitcoin using Tor,
and I found that the number of connections dropping to near-zero is
a situation which occurs rather frequently, which suggests that there
is still room to improve on the DoS handling.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Proposal: PoW-based throttling of 
Hi Mike,
thanks for your assessment.
Please find my replies in-line:
Well, as long as bulk mailing companies run around investing into
per-destination DKIM toggling, stating that they want to cut down CPU
usage due to crypto processing, I tend to believe that it can have an
important impact depending on the setup. Of course, I cannot rule out
the possibility that they would be better off investing into profiling
CPU usage, and/or exploring a higher ROI possibly coming from using
more CPU time on other processing. I see no point neglecting an issue
just because there are business models where it is irrelevant,
I did not say so, either. But bulk mailing and e-mail spam are not
orthogonal with respect to the technical characteristics that make
them possible. And nor are DKIM and PoW/hash-cash fully orthogonal.
I like the objections you raised. Avoiding DKIM because of the CPU
costs involved might be as groundless as stating "we don't use
HTTPS in order to save CPU time". Still, these substantiations can be
found in the wild, and they won't disappear because we discuss
them here on a theoretical level.
If you assume conceptual errors, though, I would suggest we discuss
the e-mail topic off-list, though. I simplify things a bit in order to
not bore the group with too much text about non-Bitcoin stuff, but
this does not mean that I'm not familiar with, or am not open for
discussing the subtle differences of different approaches that have
been researched in the e-mail business.
You might want to re-read my statement more carefully. I did not say
they don't care about delays, but I do say that they don't
care where the delays come from.
It is a known fact that Google will also penalize web sites which have
high latencies, so the top results appear as being also of technical
quality. But neither the users nor Google will care if the web site is
slow because the site owner did not allocate proper resources for
running the frontend quickly, or if the database server is making
things slow.
I agree that improving on the performance of the consensus
bootstrapping logic is an interesting topic.
I don't think this was ever about _all_ IPs suffering from DoS
measures. But I do think that Bitcoin will already suffer if we get to
a point where it is practically useless when being used over Tor, or
where this is only possible by immediately sacrificing the privacy
improvement Tor introduces.
I fully agree. A ban notice could also make it easier to track down
DoS handling issues triggered by incompatible updates, and possibly
make it harder for someone to issue bans for malicious reasons without
being noticed. Also, I see it as an important step towards a modern
security policy, because it would emphasize that the Bitcoin network
can be kept secure with minimum obscurity.
As you say, the mainstream user won't care about technical mumbo
jumbo like Tor, so he won't be likely to run Bitcoin over Tor. So,
the most likely cases where he would encounter the notification would
* incompatible update
* his machine / network is compromised and connects to Bitcoin,
  triggering DoS measures
In both cases, he would consider it as important to take action, so
even a scary notification might be the way to go.
The non-mainstream user who is willing to dive into the technical
details of running Bitcoin over Tor securely will generally be more
likely to be able to make more differentiated decisions about such an
anomaly, but I cannot see why we would want him to not have proper
tools to deal with the situation, or not to be informed about
something unusual happening.
Agreed. But as outlined above, those who enable it on purpose will
benefit, and those who don't also don't have a
disadvantage. Am I missing something?
Indeed. For the issues we're seeing, Tor can actually be regarded
to be at fault to some extent. So the Tor development might also
benefit from these things being researched. But I see no reason to
sacrifice the possibility to use Tor on Bitcoin properly at this
I also agree that a solution which improves the situation of Tor nodes
must not make it easier to attack the entire Bitcoin network. I'm
just not seeing why this would be the case for the approach I
outlined. I actually think that having multiple values to tune in
order to throttle unwanted behaviour on the network might even improve
on Bitcoin's robustness as a whole, because it might enable better
targeted moves against other (non-Tor-related) threats. How do we know
if the most dangerous attacker Bitcoin will face has more resources
with respect to IP addresses, or CPU time?
Well, banks did not even consider inventing something like Bitcoin
because what they have works well enough for their purposes. Still,
for some reasons, there are a lot of people interested in Bitcoin. I
would argue that it is because it tried to solve some things private
banking networks did not, so we might consider not only keeping
Bitcoin attractive for those who consider it as a badly implemented
form of what banking networks already provide.

Hi there,
traditionally, the Bitcoin client strives to hide which output
addresses are change addresses going back to the payer. However,
especially with today's dynamically calculated miner fees, this
may often be ineffective:
A user sending a payment using the Bitcoin client will usually enter
the payment amount only up to the number of digits which are
considered to be significant enough. So, the least significant digits
will often be zero for the payment. With dynamically calculated miner
fees, this will often not be the case for the change amount, making it
easy for an observer to classify the output addresses.
A possible approach to handle this issue would be to add a randomized
offset amount to the payment amount. This offset amount can be small
in comparison to the payment amount.
Any thoughts?

Hi there,
some thoughts in-line:
I hear that. But I don't see why mainstream wallets and wallets
designed for crypto research should not share a common core. Nor do I
understand why having a common core for different types of wallets
should be reserved for BitcoinJ.
When Bitcoin was pretty new, having a less customizable core did
probably have more of a merit in order to achieve network stability
through monoculture. But as of today, Bitcoin has proven itself as
being capable of allowing a variety of client application to run on
the network, so why should the reference implementation not reflect
this kind of diversity? The policy the mainstream distribution imposes
upon the core can still be rather restrictive.
It might deserve some research in order to determine how Tor's
privacy guarantees might be impacted if we allow attackers to mess
around with exit node choices in a rather predictable and low-cost
manner. Unfortunately, I can't think of another (non-Bitcoin)
application which puts Tor to a similar test.
I do agree that hybrid clearnet/Tor approaches come with interesting
performance properties.
BIP70 is interesting, indeed, although I still fail to understand why
(according to the specs I saw) the PaymentRequest message is signed,
but not the Payment message.
But in context of the discussed protocol issues, I think it just moves
the issue from the payer to the payee, so it may or may not partially
relieve network-related issues, depending on the usage scenario.
