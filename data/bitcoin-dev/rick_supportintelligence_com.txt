I was looking at the wiki entry for this and noticed that your
description of DNSSEC is incorrect. It is an internet standard and is
widely deployed in the root (.), many TLDs, ccTLDs and second leverl
Also understand when the IETF or ICANN adopts new (we worked on DNSSEC
no less than 10 years) standard the horizon is at least 20 years.
Nothing and I really mean nothing is adopted in mass over shorter time
I also am largely in favor of using secured zones to publish TXT
records to digital currencies. I've been thinking mainly about TXT

while this isn't a secured zone, any leverage of DNSSEC would require

I believe that any URI scheme will still leverage DNS and inherit any
base issues you would have with TXT records. I suggest looking at DANE
and reviewing their work on hardening certificate (x.509)
infrastructure as your HTTPS scheme will inherit the issues we
currently experience with CAs getting p0wned.
Hardening the protocols and usability are related. Please look at some
of the work done in the IETF which has a long history in addressing
many of the issues you are considering. Review some of the elegance in
the bitcoin protocols. The proposals in this thread are neither clear
nor elegant. If you can't reach nearly the same level of
sophistication then I suggest you rethink your scheme.

Its a negative example -- in that the IETF does not specify anything
in the PATH part of the URI. The scheme, sure, but not in the path,
there are many types of URI schemes ( start with RFC 2396 )
There is significant upside to having your own scheme and having apps
understand how to integrate with it. Frankly, having just one client
(I understand there are more) is an artifact that hinders acceptance
and participation. If you want to go the route of https then
specifying a scheme is your path forward
I still believe that it is experience that is leading this thread down
the rat-hole of CGI and HTTP requests. The stuff isn't magic, it is
just what you are used to. Review the bitcoin protocol, there is an
elegance there -- not found  in the https schemes proposed thus far.
CGI isn't a protocol, nor does it address usability/identity issues.
Providing a mapping from user at authority.tld addresses usability and
identity. I'd like to see an elegant transformation, specifically I
take to task anyone that advocates
 as elegant.

Agreed, I find measured dialog much more valuable. I also agree that
standards take time and are messy, though choosing a standard allows
additional participation and can drive interopability. One does not
need to accept IBANN but we should participate in the dialog in its
development. internet-drafts don't make it through the process
unchanged. IBANN is a starting point not the end of the discussion.

actually there are many differences. Specifying a standard using a
HTTP(s) transport for a look-up isn't something that has been done in
the PATH portion of the URI and that I was pointing out that there is
*NO* RFC that specifies such for a look-up provide the inverse of many
protocol specifications that did *not* choose that methodology.
What has happened is various schemes are specified, developed and
deployed. I am sure you are familure with many. sip:// ftp:// etc://
many are described at NAPTR records (see  are
another area that deserves research for those that desire URI schemes.

The same goes for http(s) one would not be able to use
 unless google offers the services.
ALSO look at DANE for getting around the certificate requirement for https
DNS TXT are not the only way forward, also registry/registrars can facilitate.
This most likely relies on a paid, valid certificate (that expires),
no self signed certs. I admit that running a secured https server with
a valid CA signed  cet is as simple/hard as running a DNSSEC authority
using a x.509 certificate to secure a bitcoin transaction removes some
of the anonymity of the transaction by allowing the lookup to identify
the certification, ca, crl etc thus connecting a transaction/bitcoin
address to the cert and to its issuing authority. No matter the
frequency of the destination bitcoin address changing.
IMNSHO, leveraging CAs to secure http to provide a lookup translation
to a bitcoin address will only erode anonymity. While DNS is connected
to whois there are provision for hiding behind a proxy where to the
best of my knowledge there are no such provisions offered by CA's
issuing x.509 certificates.
Should self signed cers be "allowed" or encouraged only decreases
security. Clearly DANE would be the only way to mitigate this
situation but then you are back to relying on DNSSEC to bind the x.509
wash, rinse,  ...

You are describing the problem DANE addresses, see
Using Secure DNS to Associate Certificates with Domain Names For TLS
   TLS and DTLS use PKIX certificates for authenticating the server.
   Users want their applications to verify that the certificate provided
   by the TLS server is in fact associated with the domain name they
   expect.  TLSA provides bindings of keys to domains that are asserted
   not by external entities, but by the entities that operate the DNS.
   This document describes how to use secure DNS to associate the TLS
   server's certificate with the intended domain name.
For those of you against DNSSEC, DANE leverages it significantly.
The point I have been attempting to make is if one to rely on HTTPS,
leveraging DANE will allow you to mitigate CAs and use self signed
cers but you will need to leverage DNSSEC to bind the self signed cert
using DANE and if you are going to rely on DNSSEC for DANE to support
HTTPS, why not short-circut this madness and just publish your
identifiers and secure the zone via DNSSEC and link in a stub resolver
in the client.
Short story: transform user at authority.tld  --> _btc.user.athority.tld TXT 1z....

I started from the premise that I can't remember a bitcoin address but

labels for humans to remember. The IPv4 address is the metaphor I
consider. As someone who actually worked on parts of DNSSEC I do
believe in it -- and that it offers reasonable security for
Remember MITM attacks on DNS for a transaction are for the sender
against the merchant, and it is only the wallet ID that would be
available. These identifiers are something people use "like" an
identity in that they are frequently shared in public spaces.
Also, a DNS mapping does not prevent or deny anyone from leveraging
HTTP(S) for simular mapping. My point is that DNS is designed for name
to thing mapping and its done a decent job. What I like about the DNS
is that it is frequently leveraged as a proxy for identity and http
URIs are not. Where  doesn't
feel like and identity (to me) and rick.wesson.us does.

I hope you all take a moment to see what DANE leverages with DNSSEC
and SelfSigned x.509 certs. DANE provides the capability for any

capability removes the critical path of whitelists and/or Root CA
Another nifty thing is that it can associate a cert to a domain and a
payment address, if one were to put said address in the DNS :)
Now I am sure the majority of the bitcoin user-base desires anonymity,
but as a merchant I would like to be knowable and wouldn't mind it if
my identity and those of my transactions were "known" and associated
both with my domains and x.509 cert. In most commercial transactions
(which include many of those that leverage invoices) identity is
important, at least for the merchant.
