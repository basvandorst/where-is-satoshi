I agree with Luke-Jr.  We need to try to find a decentralized solution if we are going to implement BIP 15.  Bitcoin needs to remain decentralized in every aspect of the protocol or we lose its greatest strength.
I feel like the HTTPS idea would be a great idea for a client feature, but not really something that should be added to the protocol.

Could we combine this proposal and the HTTPS proposal?
The DNSSEC TXT record could give instructions on how to query an HTTPS server to get the address.  Then we get the dynamism of HTTPS without having a rigid URL scheme for querying the server along with the advantages of DNSSEC.

It is a lot easier to set up an HTTP server to dynamically respond with addresses than a DNS record. ?It is considered a good practice to use a different address for every payment.

A query for a string and an answer can all be handled via DNS.

I may be missing something, but perhaps the simplistic method is the best.  Start all nodes off with a certain level of trust.  Lets choose an arbitrary number 5.
If a node's trust level is high enough (lets say 10) forward transactions it sends you without checking them.
If a node's trust level is low enough (lets say 0) discard any transactions they send you (i.e. don't forward them on).
For nodes with a trust level between 1 and 9, forward without checking between 1 and 9 out of every 10 transactions.  Check the others, if they are valid, increase the trust level by 1, if they are invalid decrease the trust level by 3.
All of the numbers mentioned here (1-10, 1, 10, 1, 5, and 3) are arbitrary numbers that should be determined by the client or user-preferences instead of the protocol.  This would allow for clients to have varying amounts of initial trust/paranoia about their peers.
By decreasing the amount of trust faster than we increase it, we make it harder for untrustworthy clients to cheat us.  By having a cut off point, we make it so that untrustworthy clients can not DDoS us.  By randomly verifying some transactions in the beginning, we make it harder for a new client from DDoSing us, and we prevent our own trust level from being hurt too much for forwarding on invalid transactions.
The only problem I can personally see with this system is that if Node A trusts Node B with a 10 and Node C connects to Node A, then Node C can send  transactions that are invalid to Node C via Node A without Node C being any the wiser.  This would be stopped fairly quickly as Node B would catch on and stop forwarding transactions, but it would be a problem for new Nodes.
This could be fixed (somewhat) by having a message that says not to trust a particular node.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Alternative to OP_EVAL 
I agree with Joel.  I think someone brought this up earlier as well.   Most OP_EVAL transactions won't be complex enough to require more than a few loops.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] BIP to improve the availability of blocks 
Although quite true, I actually agree though that there should be some sort of checksum for the blocks.  Bandwidth may not be a bottleneck now (or ever), but it may be at some point.  This change will help Bitcoin scale.
