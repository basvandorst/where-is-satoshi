@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP - Automated and Secure Communication 
The reason Samourai did not propose a BIP is that that was not a proposal to improve the Bitcoin protocol.
You could write a specification for it, but this mailing list is probably the wrong venue.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Bulletin boards without selective censorability 
Blockchains are bad for this, because you don't want for it to cost money to use your bulletin board. However, the problem was solved more than a decade ago. Look into FMS, which combines Usenet/mailing lists with a web of trust for spam resistance.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Floating-Point Nakamoto Consensus 
What if a miner mines a block that has a very high block reward (i.e. confirmed a juicy transaction), while at the same time having a floating point fitness very close to the minimum?
For the sake of argument, let's say the block reward is 6.50 (4% more than average), the fitness is 1.001, and the orphan rate is 0.3%.
With Nakamoto consensus, the miners would (allegedly) find it in their best interest to work on that block, since it was first. It's a problem when they don't, but the system basically works right now.
With FPNC, the miners have two equally valid options:
1) Attempt to create a block building on top of that block (reward: 2) Attempt to replace (reward: 6.50)
If they do (1), their probability of success given a matching hash is (100 - orphan rate)%, which is very close to 100%.
If they do the second, their probability of success given a hit is (100 - percentile(1.001)), which also is very close to 100%.
Option 1 has EV of .997 * 1 * 6.25 = 6.25.
Option 2 has EV of (1 - quantile(1.001)) * 1.04 * 6.25, which is surely above 6.25. I don't know how to calculate the quantile, but it's With the block subsidy getting lower and lower as time goes on, the probability of this happening goes up.
Don't we want miners to always keep the chain going forward? Your proposal incentivizes reorgs.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Suggestion: Solve year 2106 problem by taking 
Currently, Bitcoin's timestamp rules are as follows:
1. The block timestamp may not be lower than the median of the last 11 2. The block timestamp may not be greater than the current time plus two 3. The block timestamp may not be greater than 2^32 (Sun, 07 Feb 2106 06:28:16 +0000)
Thus, Bitcoin will "die" on or about 2106-02-07, when there is no timestamp below 2^32 that exceeds the median of the last 11 blocks.
If the rules were changed to the following, this problem would be 1. The block timestamp plus k*2^32 may not be lower than the median of the last 11 blocks'
2. The block timestamp plus k*2^32 may not be greater than the current time plus two hours
3. k is an integer, whose value must be the same for the calculations of Rule 1 and Rule 2
This would cause a hardfork in the year 2106, which is approximately 85.5 years from now, by which time 95% of nodes would hopefully have Another proposed solution is 64-bit timestamps. They would break compatibility with other software that has specific expectations of header fields, like ASICs' firmware. They would also cause a hardfork before the date of timestamp overflow. I thus believe them to be a less appropriate solution.
What do you think of this idea? Is it worth a BIP?
