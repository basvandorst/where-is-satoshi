@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Multi party Schnorr Rust implementation 
Hello all,
I am working for the past few months with collaborators (in cc) on
providing Rust reference implementations to existing multi party schemes
for Schnorr signatures [1]. This includes aggregated signatures,
accountable signatures (which for n out of n are multi-signatures) and
threshold signatures (wip).
The project can be found here:
 .
We aim that if the protocol is run in a configuration of a single party it
will be bip-schnorr [2] compliant.
Hope you'll find it useful :)
Questions, suggestions and pull requests are welcome!

AFAIK, There is no way to do threshold signatures non-interactively for the
general case of t out of n. Even if you are willing to maintain additional
data structure on top of the standard and change verification algorithm
(see for example appendix B in [1] where they use bitmaps).
The best way that I came up with so far (which I plan to implement in the
library) is to take SS01 paper [2], this also the paper cited in
bip-schnorr [3], and to replace Pedersen VSS with Feldman VSS (Feldman VSS
implementation can be found in [4] ). Basically taking the DKG from GG18
without paillier and the dlog pok (threshold ecdsa paper [5]) and use it
for the threshold schnorr DKG and for the ephemeral key distributed
generation. This will cause the lost of Robustness but will be more
Generally speaking - the purpose of using threshold security is to replace
hw security. The assumption is that you would rather trust that no more
than t out of n different machines will get corrupted at same time than to
trust one secure hardware. Maybe that relax a bit the demand for using air
gapped devices?
