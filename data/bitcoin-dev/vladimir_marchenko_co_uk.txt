@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] The forums... 
I am in a final stage of preparation for launch of bitcoin community
portal at  . It contains fairly advanced forum
functionality, blogging platform, community calendar, and even chat.
Professionally hosted on highend dedicated servers running FreeBSD in
a DC loated in Amsterdaam, NL
There is a  "by invitation only" section, which might be suitable for
bitcoin developers. Please consider starting using it and helping to
jump start it.
Additionally, if any bitcoin businesses would like to have their
"support" forums set up there so that they retail moderatorial control
over it please let me know.
Soft launch is scheduled on 15th of August, but it is fairly
functional already and open for registration. Feel free to register
and ping me for setting up appropriate permission for use of private
Any suggestions and feedback are also very welcome.
Kind Regards,

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Bootstrapping via BitTorrent trackers 
one possible bootstrap method of last resort,
1. create a convention of bitcoind listening on a specific last octest
of IPv4 address, let's say, .14 when possible. Those of us who have
access to IP space would use .14's.
2. if no other bootstrap method works, client could start scanning
x.x.x.14 addresses, perhaps in some semi-intelligent order (starting
from more pobable /8's and /16's), if enough people place bitcoind on
x.x.x.14 than after a 10-100 thousand checks it bound to find a
bitcoind peer.
It's messy, with all the excessive scanning etc... but it does not
depend on anything except a bunch of bitcoind by convention preferring
listening on x.x.x.14's.
Given that this is a method of last resort in bootrap chain it whould
hopefully not lead to DDOS on those unlucky to own *.14 and not
running bitcoind there. Also the more people are running bitcoind on
.14, the quicker it would find a peer, the less scanning to do. It is
kind of self-regualting.
For whatever it worth...

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Bootstrapping via BitTorrent trackers 
Jeff is absolutely correct, stating that DNS bootstrapping can
potentially be very robust.
Consider, for example, that seeds can be hosted by services like
zerigo, who provide decent management API's, as well as by thousands
of small VPS operated by people all over the world. Moreover, if
namecoin lives up to it's promises than some seeds can be hosted using
it's tlds, and as such we would get around centralised ICANN/registrar
The most practical way I see how to improve DNS bootstrapping is
publishing build instructions for a simple DNS server build and a
script which feeds it with node data. Something simple like djbdns plus
a perl script, or similar zerigo API script, would do. Than anyone can
host it. All left to do than is to hardcode a bunch of such DNS seeds
into the client.
Hardcoding seeds is not good enough? Get a convention that anyone
owning a bitcoin.* domain should point seed.bitcoin.* to a decent DNS
seed. Than clients simply scan 100-200 tld's to find working
I am not quite sure, though, is if this would enable some attacks by
poisoned seeds.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Difficulty adjustment / time issues 
As a miner I fully support route (2) and do not think that this would
cause any serious issues or discontent among miners. Most miners
surely are running ntpd already. Those who mess with the clock
intentionally will have to play ball.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] bitcoin.org SOPA/PIPA blackout 
I would like to voice my support to Amir here. It is a solidarity
gesture and from my point of view it would be great if bitcoin related
websites join the Blackout. In my view it is almost like Internet's
general strike, which is being enacted for a very good reason. To some
degree, ignoring it and continuing business as usual is almost
equivalent to being a strikebreaker.
For whatever it worth, all websites where I have some degree of
control will particpate in the blackout. Even where it means loss of
revenue for one day (actually it is likely that ad revenues tomorrow
would be easily twice the usual amount due to so many publishers
shutting down their websites.)

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] bitcoin.org - remove hackathon 
Why bitcoin.org promotes some private enterprises and not others?
May, I for example, have 20% of over the fold space on bitcoin.org
homepage for Bitcoin Magazine prmotions? Pretty please? Kind Regard,
Vladimir Marchenko.
