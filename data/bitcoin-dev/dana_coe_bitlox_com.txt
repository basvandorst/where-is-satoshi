@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Hardware Wallet Standard 
Hi everybody, just thought I?d throw my opinion in here.
The URI scheme is a nice idea, but this ignores the fact that hardware wallet vendors do most of the work on talking between the computer/mobile and the wallet on a lower level of communication. In the case of BitLox, the base protocol is Google?s ProtoBuf. The commands and transaction data is in a ?schema? which is then encoded in different methods accessible via ProtoBuf (depending on the data being sent). The advantages of this protocol is that it can be implemented on a wide variety of platforms. (but that?s a whole 'nother discussion)
The URI would be handled waaaaay up in the specific application (such as the mytrezor wallet software or the various standalone wallets) - nowhere near the actual hardware communications layer.
Best regards,

I suggest in the spirit of the times that we not use USD as the reference, but USDT.
Everyone knows Tethers are much more flexible in tracking the true value of the US dollar.
