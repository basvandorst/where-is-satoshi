If the 20 byte SHA1 is now considered insecure (with good reason), what about RIPEMD-160 which is the foundation of Bitcoin addresses?
Is that also susceptible to such an attack vector?
What does that mean for old addresses?

?so far. I wonder how long that vacation will last?
...but we can be sure that it will be, since the dollar value held in existing utxos continues to increase...
Does that offer any greater protection? That?s not so clear to me as the outputs (at least for p2pkh) only verify the public key against the final 20 byte hash. Specifically, in the first (notional) case the challenge would be to find a private key that has a public key that hashes to the final hash. In the second (realistic) case, you merely need to add the sha256 hash into the problem, which doesn?t seem to me to increase the difficulty by any significant amount?

Yea, well. I don?t think it is ethical to post instructions without an associated remediation (BIP) if you don?t see the potential attack.
I was rather hoping that we could have a fuller discussion of what the best practical response would be to such an issue?

Hi Peter,
I agree with the latter part of your statement but am actually much less confident about the first part? I need to run some numbers on that.
I really, really don?t want to get into it but segwit has many aspects that are less appealing, not least of which being the amount of time it would take to reach the critical mass. Surely there's a number of alternative approaches which could be explored, even if only to make a fair assessment of a best response?

Hi Pieter,
?Any alternative?? What about reverting to:
[, OP_CHECKSIG]
or perhaps later
[, OP_CHECKSIG]
This appears to get away from the issue without introducing a lot of other concerns?
(IIRC the RIPEMD thing was justified on convenience and compactness).
Could that be the alternative?

That?s the part I?m less convinced about, and why I asked the original question re SHA1 vs RIPEMD. I?m checking my own numbers (and as you?ll appreciate it?s a powers of ten thing), but I do see a vector. Which would mean that if RIPEMD were weakened in any way, single-key transactions could suddenly become badly exposed.

Thank you Pieter - that was really helpful. I realize now that I was thinking of a preimage attack but had mistakenly assumed that the birthday bound applied...
So the unit operation: [genkeypair; ripemd160(sha256(pubkey));check_utxoset] would need to be performed 2.9*10^42 and not (as I had first calculated) 2.4*10^18. Oops. My bad.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Script Abuse Potential? 
Hi all,
Suppose someone were to use the following pk_script:
[op_2dup, op_2dup, op_2dup, op_2dup, op_2dup, ...(to limit)..., op_2dup, op_hash160, , op_equalverify, op_checksig]
This still seems to be valid AFAICS, and may be a potential attack vector?

Agree that experimentation is great and that it is usually the case that the security model differs.
Isn?t it also true also that the security model for SegWit is distinct from that defined for the Bitcoin token?
It does not appear to be a "chain of digital signatures" as per the original definition? I do understand that the hash state is still respected at block level. I?m referring more to the token?s chain.
Any clarification appreciated.
