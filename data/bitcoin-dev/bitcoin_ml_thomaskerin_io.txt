This is a pretty big departure from cumulative POW.
Could you explain to me what you see happening if a node with this patch and no history starts to sync, and some random node gives it a block with a better fitness test for say height 250,000? No other solution will have a better fitness test at that height, so from my understanding its going to stop syncing. How about even later - say this proposal is activated at block 750,000. At 850,000, someone decides it'd be fun to publish a new block 800,000 with a better fitness test. What happens the 50,000 blocks?
I can imagine the miners not being particularly happy about it - their previously 50:50 chance (well, sort of, it's based on resources- connectivity, validation overheads, etc) their tied block would succeed, vs the situation with this change - blocks that are inherently more or less valid than others.
I think these days people are more focused on improving defences at the networking layer than in the consensus layer - especially when it affects mining incentives. I don't see how people will take this seriously - especially when you regard how often consensus changes are made to _fix_ something as opposed to add something new.
Best regards,
