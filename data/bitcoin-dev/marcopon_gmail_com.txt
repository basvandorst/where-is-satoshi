My first post here, hope I'm following the right conventions.
I had this humble idea for a while, so I thought to go ahead and propose
BIP: XX
Title: URI scheme for Blockchain exploration
Author: Marco Pontello
Status: Draft
Type: Standards Track
Created: 29 August 2015
This BIP propose a simple URI scheme for looking up blocks, transactions,
addresses on a Blockchain explorer.
The purpose of this URI scheme is to enable users to handle all the
requests for details about blocks, transactions, etc. with their preferred
tool (being that a web service or a local application).
Currently a Bitcoin client usually point to an arbitrary blockchain
explorer when the user look for the details of a transaction (es. Bitcoin
Wallet use BitEasy, Mycelium or Electrum use Blockchain.info, etc.).
Other times resorting to cut&paste is needed.
The same happens with posts and messages that reference some particular
txs or blocks, if they provide links at all.
The URI follow this simple form:
blockchain: I thought about using some more complex scheme, or adding qualifiers to
distinguish blocks from txs, but in the end I think that keeping it simple
should be practical enough. Blockchain explorers can apply the same
disambiguation rules they are already using to process the usual search
show any kind of Blockchain references), using this scheme mean that he
can simply make it a blockchain: link and be done with it, without having
to worry about any specific Blockchain explorer or provide a means for the
user to select one.
Blockchain explorers in turn will simply offer to handle the blockchain:
URI, the first time the user visit their website, or launch/install the
application, or even set themselves if there isn't already one.
Users get the convenience of using always their preferred explorer, which
can be especially handy on mobile devices, where juggling with cut&paste
is far from ideal.

Sorry to ask again but... what's up with the BIP number assignments?
I thought that it was just more or less a formality, to avoid conflicts and
BIP spamming. And that would be perfectly fine.
But since I see that it's a process that can take months (just looking at
the PR request list), it seems that something different is going on. Maybe
it's considered something that give an aura of officiality of sorts? But
that would make little sense, since that should come eventually with
subsequents steps (like adding a BIP to the main repo, and eventual
Having # 333 assigned to a BIP, should just mean that's easy to refer to a
particular BIP.
That seems something that could be done quick and easily.
What I'm missing? Probably some historic context?

A random thought: aren't most communication over a data link already
compressed, at some point?
When I used a modem, we had the V.42bis protocol. Now, nearly all ADSL
connections using PPPoE, surely are. And so on.
I'm not sure another level of generic, data agnostic kind of compression
will really give us some real-life practical advantage over that.
Something that could take advantage of of special knowledge of the specific
data, instead, would be an entirely different matter.
Just my 2c.

To anyone that followed the discussion (from some time ago) about the
proposed new URI for Blockchain references / exploration, I just wanted to
point out that I have collected the feedback provided, reworked the text,
put the BIP on GitHub and created a pull request:
The need for an URI for this come to mind again in the last days looking at
Eternity Wall, which IMHO provide a use case that we will see more and more
in the (near) future: Using that service, when you want to check for the proof that a specific
message was written in the Blockchain, it let you choose from 5 different
Mycelium wallet recently added the option to select one of 15 block
And there's the crypto_bot on reddit/r/bitcoin that detect reference to
transaction an add a message with links to 7 different explorers.
I think that's clearly something that's needed.

Thanks for the comments! Now I fixed the typos (hope to have got them all,
English isn't my first language), clarified the chain part a bit, and fixed
the link. There probably is a better way to reference that source code part
with the genesis blocks hashs, in a way that doesn't need to be changed,
Now the main change would be to put in a proper BIP number! :)

OK, adding the relevant code fragment is probably the simplest and direct
option. Done.

That surely make sense.
A URI like that perfectly readable, unambiguous and simple enough.
And nice to see a Wallet developer showing interest for this! :)

I see that using the genesis block hash would be the perfectly rigorous way
to do it, but what do you think about the possibility of letting also use
the name constants, as a simple / more relaxed alternative? That would
spare a source lookup just to write a correct reference to a tx, maybe in a
forum or a post.
So a reference to a certain tx could be either:
(or a different element name maybe)

I see your point. But I personally like that the chain part could be
optional, given that the vast majority of the references in the end will be
to Bitcoin main net.

Oh, my bad! Right, sounds pretty good to me then.

In fact I was just about to ask for some details about this part of the

Just in the interest of clarity, I think you should clarify who you are
including in the "we".

Hi Jeff!

I don't know how you got that raw block, but it seems a bit odd.
If you look at it in an hex editor, you'll notice that every odd byte is 0,
and that explain the unusual high compression ratio.
