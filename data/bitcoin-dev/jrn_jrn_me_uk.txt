@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Error handling in payment protocol (BIP-0070 
Dear Gavin, all,
Going over the payment protocol specifications, I've noticed that
there's appears to be a lack of specificity on handling of error states.
In most cases there are reasonably obvious solutions, however it would
seem positive to formalise processes to ensure consistency. I'm
wondering therefore if either you'd be willing to edit the existing BIP,
or advise on whether this is useful to write up as a new BIP?
The main area of concern is handling unexpected problems while sending
the Payment message, or receiving the corresponding PaymentACK message.
For example, in case of a transport layer failure or non-200 HTTP status
code while sending the Payment message, what should the wallet software
do next? Is it safe to re-send the Payment message? I'd propose that for
any transport failure or 500 status code, the client retries after a
delay (suggested at 30-60 seconds). For 400 status codes, the request
should not be repeated, and as such the user should be alerted and a
copy of the Payment message saved to be resent later.
For 300 (redirect and similar) status codes, is it considered safe to
follow redirects? I think we have to, but good to make it clear in the
On the merchant's side; I think it would be useful for there to be
guidance for handling of errors processing Payment messages. I'd suggest
that Payment messages should have a fixed maximum size to avoid merchant
systems theoretically having to accept files of any size; 10MB would
seem far larger than in any way practical, and therefore a good maximum
size? A defined maximum time to wait (to avoid DDoS via connection
holding) might be useful too, although I'd need to do measurements to
find what values are tolerable.
I would like to have the protocol state that merchant systems should
handle repeatedly receiving the same Payment message, and return an
equivalent (if not identical) PaymentACK to each. This is important in
case of a network failure while the client is sending the Payment
message, as outlined above.
Lastly, I'm wondering about potential timing issues with transactions;
if a merchant system wants to see confirmation of a transaction before
sending a PaymentACK, any thoughts on whether it should hold the
connection, or send a PaymentACK with a memo indicating payment has been
seen on the relay network but is not yet confirmed, or something else?
Happy to write this up as a new BIP if that's more appropriate than
editing the original, and please do tell me if I've missed anything
obvious/prior discussion on this topic.

Longer term I was wondering about embedding the PaymentRequest into web
pages directly via the  tag, which could eliminate need for
BIP0072 and potentially improve user interface integration that way.

Dear all,
Still going through the payment protocol specifications... the MIME
types in BIP0071 aren't IANA registered, and honestly look unlikely to
be accepted if they were submitted as-is.
Latest RFC on media type registration is RFC 6838, which very strictly
restricts what can go in the default "application/" namespace.
Essentially they'd want it to be an ISO standard or similar. There are
vendor namespaces, which look much more feasible (this is how Powerpoint
2007 ended up as

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Proposal: Encrypt bitcoin messages 
The concern is that if you can monitor traffic in and out of a single
node, you can determine which transactions originate from it vs those
which it relays. That's not great, certainly, but how many nodes
actually require that level of security, and surely they can use Tor or
VPN services if so?
Further, unless the remote nodes are in some way trusted, you're
changing the attack from read-only to requiring the ability to perform a man in the middle attack - that doesn't seem much harder to me.
As Gregory states, there's been at least two recent serious if not
catastrophic OpenSSL bugs, and the consequences of Heartbleed if the
Bitcoin network had been vulnerable are the stuff of nightmares.
Very difficult to see the risk/reward payoff being worthwhile.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] death by halving 
I'd suggest looking at how Dogecoin's mining schedule has worked out, for how halvings tend to actually affect the market. Part of Dogecoin's design was that it would halve very quickly (around every 75 days, in fact), so it's essentially illustrating worst case scenario.
Firstly, miners do not all move/shut down as a batch. Some will stay out of loyalty/apathy/optimism, so there's a jolt to hashrate when the rewards drop, and then a drift towards a steady-state. In most cases, the hardware costs vastly exceed the running costs, so while they may never see ROI due to the reward change, there's no benefit in stopping mining either.
On the other side, mining hardware update cycles are extremely aggressive, and newer hardware runs much faster. Further, those with newer hardware are likely to have the best hashrate to power ratio, and be less likely to turn off or rent out their hardware.
So, in theory there may be an uncomfortable period where the hashrate drops, but I would expect that drop to be much less than 50%, that most hardware that's turned off is not cost-effective to rent out, and that newer hardware being launched would push the hashrate back up again within a sensible timeframe.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Alternative chain support for payment protocol 
BIP 70 currently lists two networks, main and test (inferred as testnet3) for payment protocol requests. This means that different testnets cannot be supported trivially, and the protocol cannot be used for alternative coins (or, lacks context to indicate which coin the request applies to, which is particularly dangerous in cases where coins share address prefixes).
I propose adding a new optional "genesis" field as a 16 byte sequence containing the SHA-256 hash of the genesis block of the network the request belongs to, uniquely identifying chains without any requirement for a central registry. For backwards compatibility, the "network" field would contain "main" for Bitcoin main net, "test" for Bitcoin testnet3, and "other" for other networks apart from those two.
I'd appreciate initial feedback on the idea, and if there's no major objections I'll raise this as a BIP.

I'm cautious of using human-meaningful identifiers, especially any that might require a central repository, due to name collisions. Examples that could be complicated include BitcoinDark, Litedoge, and other names that base on existing coins. I think the ability to differentiate between test networks is also useful.
Could certainly just use the genesis hash as network ID, that would work. Bit long, but suspect 64 bytes isn't the end of the world! I'll see if any more responses come in then raise a BIP for using genesis hash as an alternative to short names.

Trimmed some of the thread to clarity
True, but as Jorge points out, it's generally better not to have special It was something I was thinking about with the BIP 66 fork, that it could be used as a safety measure, but could also be used to find merchants & exchanges who are accepting coins on the wrong branch of a fork (and therefore are susceptible to double-spend attacks). For fork detection it's probably safer for the client to provide a recent block hash with the payment response.
I think genesis hash collisions are probably acceptable; or, the duplicate coins are so far rarely long-lived and it's therefore not a major concern at least. The server should reject any attempt to pay on the wrong chain, in hindsight, as it will try to relay on the network it expects and the transaction will be rejected.
That could definitely be done, for example by making the genesis field "repeated", so it specifies all potential networks. The response would need to indicate which hash it used, but that could be chain tip (with height in a further field), and provide fork detection.

Arriving slightly late to the discussion, apologies.
Personally I wouldn't have written that patch, but I know development of
hostile patches happens out of sight, and if it can be written, we have
to presume it will be written eventually. I'd have preferred a patch
that only replaced non-final txes, which is the use-case I have for
transaction replacement, but that's easy to add back in.
I'm certainly not terribly convinced of the security of vanilla
zero-confirmation transactions myself, for reasons including but not

people do make irrational decisions, and trusting network security on
everyone behaving perfectly rationally is not a workable model either.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Re-enabling simple tx replacement 
Dear all,
I've been looking at atomic cross-chain trading (
 ) between the
Bitcoin and Dogecoin blockchains, and have a mostly functional
prototype. However as it stands if the refund transaction is relayed
before the actual spend transaction, it "blocks" the legitimate spend
transaction from being accepted into the memory pool.
I'd like to enable TX replacement in the case where all conflicting
transactions are not final, and the replacement is final. While yes,
this still leaves scope for "unpaid for" bandwidth, hopefully being able
to do a single replacement isn't a major issue.
For those wanting background on this,
 may be useful reading.
I've drafted a patch for this
but have not yet raised a PR, as historically this has lead to a lot of
discussion in Github which is better suited to this mailing list.
I'm therefore looking for feedback while I continue testing that patch,
and any comments would be welcomed.

Grabbing a simple test case:
- that won't lock until 0028 UTC on the 5th.
I've tried closing the wallet, moving the wallet.dat file out of the
way, and then attempting the spend transaction (which can be locked
immediately), and it either rejects it on acceptance to mempool, or it
is never included in a block.
Compare with
where the refund was not sent first, and the transaction has succeeded.
They can only replace a non-final transaction with a final transaction,
so the replacement can happen at most once (any later replacement would
be attempting to replace a final transaction, and therefore fails). So,
while they can expend twice the bandwidth compared to a non-replacement,
I don't think that's a major issue?

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] BIP70: why Google Protocol Buffers for 
For what it's worth, there was consideration of replacing protocol
buffers when modifying BIP70 to function with the altcoin I work on
(changes were required anyway in eliminate any risk that payment
requests could not be accidentally applied to the wrong blockchain). The
eventual conclusion was that while we might have used JSON or XML if we
were starting from scratch, there's no choice that's clearly better.
While deployed infrastructure for payment protocol is still quite
limited, it seems that the cost to replace at this point is higher than not.
If there's ever a major reworking of the standard, for example to handle
recurring payments, it's probably worth thinking about then, but
protocol buffers result in a compact data format which is supported by
most major languages (and size is a concern if dealing with Bluetooth or
NFC), and has no major drawbacks I am aware of.

That was essentially what we did in the end, we replaced the network
identifier ("main"/"test") with the genesis block hash. The result is
never going to accidentally work with Bitcoin Core (nor vice-versa), but
is readily extensible to any other altcoins that want to use the
specification without requiring any sort of central registry.

I'd back this if we can't find a permanent solution - 2MB gives us a lot more wiggle room in the interim at least; one of my concerns with block size is 3 transactions per second is absolutely tiny, and we need space for the network to search for an equilibrium between volume and pricing without risk of an adoption spike rendering it essentially unusable.
I'd favour switching over by block height rather than time, and I'd suggest that given virtually every wallet/node out there will require testing (even if many do not currently enforce a limit and therefore do not need changing), 6 months should be considered a minimum target. I'd open with a suggestion of block 390k as a target.

Not so much that the implementation is difficult, as it requires context to validate a block size, rather than being able to validate it without requiring the preceeding blocks. Yes, time on different machines may vary, but block time is safe to use for this, because it's a straight-forward test of "if block time is acceptable and block time is after  then maximum block size allowed is n MB otherwise m MB".

So, if consensus shouldn't really be between the developers (which is fine), should we empower users to control consensus? I've been working on a fork framework anyway, which can support reasonably arbitrary consensus changes (currently against block height, but moving towards block time). Theoretically it could be modified to load consensus parameters (which block size would have to be added to) from disk at startup, rather than having them hard-coded.
Is that considered desirable? Will raise as a PR if so. If not, where do we draw a line between developer and user consensus?

The code so far is fairly limited in scope, essentially making it possible to change the values in consensus/params.h based on block height. The actual code to interpret those values does need to be provided ahead of time, of course, so there's still developer time to implement, it just moves consensus arguments to the users.
Loading the values from disk rather than hard-coding them is a reasonably straight forward extension to the code, in theory. The existing work has application-specific changes that would need stripping out, but you can get an idea of what this would look like from

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Concerns Regarding Threats by a Developer 
I've got a few thoughts on this, but they don't really attach well to a single message, so starting a fresh message in the same thread. I'm going to try being brief.
There's a lot of talk about not forking. Sorry, but they're going to happen, planned and unplanned. Even if no intentional forks occur from here on, I hope it's obvious that there will be further accidental forks (at least unless and until someone prepares a formal proof of a Bitcoin wallet). We need to be more comfortable with that, and plan ahead. Education is key here, a lot of people don't understand what a fork is, how it will affect them, how to recognise a fork or how to recover. I'll dig out what materials I've written already and try making them more widely available, as a start.
On whether code forks are a solution to disagreements - I'm not quite sure what people expect will happen where a group believes there is an existential threat to Bitcoin and they cannot get Bitcoin Core updated. I may disagree with Mike & Gavin on timescale, but I do believe there's a likelihood inaction will kill Bitcoin, and in that context I see the rational choice as taking the perceived smaller risk of a fork killing Bitcoin. BIP100 appears to be making progress, however, right now I think the best option is pursuing it towards something that can be agreed on by all. I would also happily go with an 8MB block size even if just to buy us (IMHO a lot) more time.
Lastly, there seems to be a number of people who believe inaction through apathy is fine. I respect those who form considered opinions and tell me why they believe 1MB is fine, but I do ask that people either put the effort in to help make decisions, or delegate to someone else. Decentralised does not mean there's no decision making, it means we're all decision makers, and frankly I think there's effectively negligence in that capacity right now. I'd also point out this ongoing discussion is a huge time sink to a number of people who could be making much more useful contributions, and that again going in circles endlessly discussing in the name of decentralisation isn't positive.

I'm struggling to illustrate how incredibly low 7 transactions per second is, not just for a payment network, but even just for a clearance network (i.e. to balance transactions between institutions and/or chains). As an example, the Clearing House Interbank Payments System (CHIPS) is a US-only, inter-bank only clearance network, which handled about 3.5 transactions per second (average) in 2014 While it seems likely the US population of 300 million makes more transactions individually than many other countries, and therefore we can't simply multiply that by 20 to estimate what a global clearance network might require, hopefully it's clear that if Bitcoin is to scale globally, it needs substantially more transaction throughput even if main chain transactions become something for banks and the super rich. I don't know how much more, but I can't look at the 8MB reportedly backed by a number of mining pools and say it's clearly insufficient, at least.
I should emphasise that I don't think we need to jump straight to 8MB (or otherwise), if a scaling protocol can be decided upon that would be ideal, but we should be planning ahead while it's still relatively easy to make these changes.

I don't think essentially replacing most of Testnet with a specialised test chain is a good idea, but this might be a good time to consider a 4th test network with very large blocks from genesis onwards.
I do tend to think 2 years of 8mb blocks is excessive as a test, too, and while certainly large projects should have or can raise funds for test infrastructure, I would worry about the smaller stuff out there. Is there anything specific 2 years gives us over, say, 6 months?

Also, before that's turned into "8MB blocks are infeasible", my presumption is that blocks are not expected to jump suddenly to 8MB, and that most will have time to ramp up storage and bandwidth.
The point about not outright replacing existing test data is the more critical one, anyway, although in retrospect we could simply add spam transactions on top of existing transactions.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] The need for larger blocks 
I'd argue that at the point where there's consistently more transactions than the network can handle, there are two significant risks. Firstly, that people don't care enough to pay the transaction fees required to get their transaction prioritised over another's, and secondly that as transactions start outright failing (which will happen with enough transactions backlogged) the network is considered unreliable, the currency illiquid, and there's a virtual "bank rush" to get into a more usable currency.
I understand the desire to use current demand to model future, however I feel there's a lack of understanding of just how inadequate the main chain is as a global clearance network. My go-to example for this is CHIPS (US-only, inter-bank only clearance) which already handles slightly over 3 transactions per second on average across a year ( If Bitcoin is to be used across a wider portion of the world's population, and/or beyond clearance between financial institutions, it needs larger blocks. This is not about handling the several orders of magnitude more transactions that would be required to replace credit cards or cash, but simply to enabling other technologies to perform that Also, and I'm aware most on this list do understand the situation better than this, I find it immensely frustrating to see people suggesting that Greece or other large groups should adopt Bitcoin, while there's clearly inadequate support (on chain or off) to do so.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Block Size Increase 
Can I just add my own support for this - as has been stated elsewhere in this discussion, hard forks are difficult, and risky. The earlier we have a decision, and the earlier the change goes into the code, the easier that is.
Even if the decision was the actual block size change is fine to leave until 2020, I'd like to see the code committed ASAP so that every new install, and every upgrade from there on gets the new version.
My personal opinion only is that 7 transactions a second is insanely limited even if the main chain does nothing but act as a backbone between other chains and transaction networks. I don't think that's overly controversial. I think 2016 is too early for a 20mb block size, though. I'm inclined to suggest a schedule of expansion, say to 2mb in 2016, 4mb in 2018, 8mb in 2020 and 20mb in 2022 where it stops. The intent would be to provide enough size pressure to motivate scaling work, while not limiting Bitcoin overly.
Further, I think this highlights that we need more work on fees. Right now fees and transactions included are fairly naive, but I'd like to see the absolute block size limit as a hard upper bound, with miners imposing soft limits based on a balance cost of storage, number of outputs vs inputs (and therefore impact on the UTXOs), and risk of orphan blocks to determine which transactions are actually worth including in each block. If anyone has numbers on block size vs orphan rate that would be really useful, BTW.

I'm presuming that schedule is just an example, as you'd end up with insanely large block sizes in a few years.
Absolutely, yes, an increase schedule is an option if people agree on it, and I think the better option, as the current limit too low, but jumping straight to a value big enough for "indefinitely" is a huge jump.
Gave some thought to scaling block size based on transaction fees, but suspect it would end up with miners sending huge fees to themselves with transactions that aren't relayed (so they only are actioned if they make it into a block that miner mines) to make the network allow bigger blocks.

I think potential fee subsidies for cleaning up UTXO (and/or penalties for creating more UTXO than you burn) are worth thinking about. As Gavin's post ( gavinandresen.ninja/utxo-uhoh ) indicates, UTXO cost is far higher than block storage, so charging differently for the in/out mismatches should make good economic sense.
