@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Monetary Authority for Bitcoin 
This is no doubt probably a very controversial Bitcoin Improvement Proposal
and is also a very rough draft of one.
Bitcoin lacks a Central Bank. This is good and bad. A central bank benefits
those with political connections. But Bitcoin lacks price stability, this
generates menu costs, and incentivizes speculation. I propose the creation
of a monetary authority for Bitcoin that sets block reward to a new
mathematical formula.
The velocity of the Bitcoins that are in circulation likely approaches
100,000x per year as compared to 1x - 4x for the USD. This in itself is not
bad. But given that only 10% to 20% of Bitcoins are circulating, this means
that the price of Bitcoin is decided largely through speculation. In fact
the price of a Bitcoin is irrelevant to those who use Bitcoins as a
currency because it appears the majority of coins being used are
immediately being sold and repurchased in the exchanges for the sole
purpose of buying goods.
Unless Bitcoins can be used to purchase intermediate goods and have a
closed economic ecosystem, Bitcoin will be too vulnerable to speculation
and would not be a viable currency. But the development of a closed
economic ecosystem is stymied by the uncertainty of Bitcoin prices and
Fortunately the infrastructure for transacting Bitcoin has long been
established, with many major exchanges. Nearly all major exchanges announce
recent prices. At the point when a block is generated, the miner will also
add the exchange price of bitcoin between various other currencies and
crypto-currencies to the blockchain. The exchanges that are kept track of
could be hard coded into Bitcoin or the miner could choose, how this works
is not something I'm personally focused on.
With every new block, the miner will compare the cumulative percentage
change in the exchange price of Bitcoin over the previous 432 blocks. The
standard deviation of the percentage change in exchange rates will be
calculated. Outliers will be excluded, this is so that in case x-currency
suffers from hyperinflation, the x-currency will be ignored. It is
extremely unlikely for all the world?s currencies to be suffering from
hyperinflation caused by monetary expansion as opposed to a supply shock.
Every 432 blocks the block reward will be reevaluated. For every 5%
increase in the geometric mean of Bitcoin exchange rates in relation to the
world?s currencies would increase the block reward by 3%. A 5% decrease in
the geometric mean of Bitcoin exchange rates will decrease the block reward
by 3%. Changes in the exchange rates of less than 5% will not alter the
block reward.
The minimum block reward will be one Bitcoin.
Why is this better then the current system? Very simple, we are still
dependent on banks. Currently Bitcoin is poised to replace Visa and Paypal,
not the Federal Reserve. Bitcoin will be less efficient then Visa and
Paypal because it takes times to transfer money out of exchanges to one's
bank account and vice versa. In order for Bitcoin to replace the US dollar,
it needs to not be a more complex version of a debit card. It needs to have
a closed economic ecosystem, where all transactions are done in Bitcoin
(Consumer > Merchant > Wholesaler > Factory), and the only people who use
the exchanges are merchants who need to and those who wish to gamble on
In order for Bitcoin to have widespread acceptance, it needs price
stability. My proposal won't peg the Bitcoin to any one currency, but it
would reduce month to month variability in relation to a basket of
currencies and discourage views that it's speculative.
Look at the current system, it's not healthy and it's not a currency.

It is not a violation of the trust of those holding the currency. Many
people bought Bitcoin in the hopes that it's value in the relation of other
currencies will increase, not because there's a fixed money supply. The
majority of people using Bitcoin as a currency in exchange for real goods
are using the exchanges.
 My proposal will still allow for 4.9% semi-weekly variations in the price
of Bitcoin, allowing for it to appreciate 11,800% per year.

Agreed Mike.
The economic parameters of Bitcoin are fixed in stone forever. Adding a
monetary authority to Bitcoin is impossible and undesirable because the
implicit contract of Bitcoin is that there would finally be a currency in
which no one could mess around with. It would betray all prior holders.
But these are ideas everyone is free to experiment with in new altcoins. If
the lack of inflation in Bitcoin ever becomes a problem in day-to-day
usage, such a parallel chain could become the de-facto cryptocurrency for
spending. Or just maybe fiat already works well enough there...
-------------- --------------
How do you propose to use Bitcoin on a week-long vacation or for life in
general, when it's value constantly swings up and down? Or for the average
person's paycheck to swing up and down in value every week? Awfully hard to
budget. There is also a catch-22, no altcoin can gain acceptance because
the infrastructure for Bitcoin already exists, but without infrastructure,
no altcoin can gain acceptance. Furthermore, the average merchant or
consumer lacks the idealism or knowledge to bring about such changes in
Bitcoin. It's a lofty idea that the average person will bring about such
change when they don't bring about such change already in their own lives.
It is ironic considering that there's no Bitcoin "chamber of commerce,"
just a few programmers in a development mailing list who direct the future
of Bitcoin, and thus these merchants you speak of have little to no voice
what so ever, with a few exceptions of merchants who do subscribe to this
mailing list.
What I am proposing makes sound economic sense. It is the only way to fix
the speculation crisis.
Just ask an economist.
And the economic parameters of bitcoin are not fixed in stone. If there
needs to be a change, it will be messy but it could happen.
Besides, using Austrian precepts of inflation blurs the fact that deflation
will still be possible under my proposal. Although amusingly enough
Austrian-defined inflation is still occurring within Bitcoin, in fact
faster then desired since blocks are being processed every seven minutes
now as opposed to ten, and it's quite likely when 28nm ASIC miners are
released that blocks will be processed every five minutes before the
difficulty is adjusted again.

I think Bitcoin should have a sanity check: after three days if only four
blocks have been mined, difficulty should be adjusted downwards.
This might become important in the near future. I project a Bitcoin mining

I think you misunderstood my statement. If time > 3 days, and after 4
blocks have been mined, then difficulty would be reset.
In theory, one would have to isolate roughly one percent of the Bitcoin
network's hashing power to do so. Which would indicate an attack by a state
actor as opposed to anything else. Arguably, the safest way to run Bitcoin
is through a proprietary dial-up network.

It does take a state-level actor to apparently disconnect *multiple *miners
from the rest of the network.
How many Bitcoin miners hash an entire percent or more of the Bitcoin
network? What you're proposing is an attack at the highest levels of the
internet infrastructure.

Maybe it's because the arguments being presented are nonsensical and
irrelevant to the current Bitcoin network topology, composed of a small
number of mining pools, not solo miners? Furthermore I think people would
realize that their mining pool has gone "off the reservation" so to speak.

You just completely ignored my point. I'm not sure who's trying to insult
whom, or if you're attempting an argumentum ad hominem. My idea is
completely valid.
The only way to man in the middle to have such a large percentage of hash
power is to either a) attack a pool (which people would notice when their
withdrawals go nowhere), b) attack a large number of nodes, which must have
enough combined hash power to mine four blocks within three days for people
to notice (I think it is unlikely for Bitcoin point of sale nodes to have
significant hash power), or c) the attacker himself has 1% of the hash
power and is diverting it to conduct a man in the middle attack against one
single person (as opposed to a major retailer who has a round the clock IT
staff). In order for a large number of nodes to be attacked, it must be by
someone who either is a state actor or an ISP, at which point you've
already lost.
It's really simple math, it require on even the most optimistic estimates a
tenth of a percent of the total network hash power to mine 4 blocks within
three days with good luck. Or maybe this single person is on vacation, then
it would take a hundredth of a percent of the total hash power over two
weeks. I think very few people even have a hundredth of a percent of the
total hash power, which goes to show how secure the network is, and how
little my proposal would weaken network security. I'll concede that
difficulty could be reduced only by 80% if only four blocks were mined in 3
days, which would provide sufficient margin against these proposed man in
the middle attacks, because block-chain growth would be noticeably reduced.
But I repeat myself. Repeatedly. I wish you would understand my points. I'm
making a good faith effort to provide an original idea before it's possibly
too late. But fine. I have nothing more to add, and it's the holidays.

This will easily create too much data in the block chain.
I think it's probably better to trust online wallets to handle complex
financial transactions such a debits or credits.
If Bitcoin achieves Visa-levels of popularity, that would mean one megabyte
of transactions per second (even assuming script isn't used), or ~30
terabytes per year. After a decade the Bitcoin blockchain can only be
stored by Amazon or Google or the Web Archive, even assuming Kryder's Law
If the Bitcoin blockchain instead becomes cheque clearinghouse style
transaction system, many problems involving blockchain growth become
Sure, this is supposed to be a trustless system, but there's a reason why
everyone relies on trust in the real world.
