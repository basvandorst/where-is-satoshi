There's a bigger problem here honestly. The p2p network is just starved for
connectable slots.
You can start up a bitcoind, on a host with sufficient connectivity, with
-maxconnections=512 and they will fill in <15 minutes.
As to why sort by version: <=3.23 has problems serving the blocks from the
last 2 months. It can take days to weeks to get the whole chain if you're
connecting to those nodes.

If the caveat of a trusted third party is acceptable and, as greg mentioned,
if there was a way to export unsigned transactions and then import/broadcast
after signing this becomes fairly trivial.
Shamir's + 3rd party to combine and sign means no protocol level changes.
Process could work something like this:
Parties agree to endpoint destination address and provide it to third party.
Third party generates key and provides shares to each party in the txn and
the resulting address to both as well.
Third party destroys (preferably, never stores) private key.
Sender sends to address.
Both parties after confirmation of reciept of goods or what have you provide
shares back to third party who uses the privkey to xfer inputs to the
previously agreed upon destination subtracting their fee.
This resembles more traditional escrow setups and relies on the trust of a
third party, which is not ideal, but would be fairly simple to implement
until the other proposals could be better investigated and implemented.

I don't think anything simple enough to actually be used by people in
general does. Same concept as what I proposed earlier before nanotube gave
me the context for Gavin's intent on irc.
Now that I'm understanding the use case I really think the best way to go
about this initially is like you said earlier.
Provide methods to export/import unsigned txns, provide methods to run the
GUI in a way that can track your own addresses with only pubkeys available
to the client, provide methods to sign and import/export/broadcast signed
With these tools offline wallets become feasible. Combined with wallet
crypto I think this is really the best that can be done to protect users
from themselves in a way that isn't too complicated for them to actually

I don't think this should be a vote at all. Given Greg/Matt's numbers it is a necessity to ensure network stability over the next 90 days.
Also: the default will only apply to pre-built binaries, which bitcoind isn't one of, so for people running bitcoind this default doesn't matter at all. Just continue building without UPNP support as you're already doing.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Reconsider build system change? 
Cmake is just as bad as autotools, just with a different syntax and more "buzz" behind it right this second. I don't see any advantage to it over autotools unless you're not familiar with either and even then I wouldn't really call it an advantage. It's just different.
It also requires a dependency that isn't installed by default anywhere, as already mentioned, and is less known outside of some obscure qt/kde circles and so finding people who are familiar with it and are willing to maintain it is more difficult. Autotools is the devil you know.
You'll probably throw out that mysql and compiz have switched to it, but really, those projects aren't something that should be emulated by anyone. Ever.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Reconsider build system change? 
This would be true if gmake didn't build/run basically everywhere; but, it does.
Don't get me wrong, I'm not defending autotools' design or implementation. It is; however, more ubiquitous and understood by a much wider audience.
I would say that's actually a mark against cmake. If you need a gui to select build options because your cli doesn't have proper help output something is wrong.
If you're willing to setup and maintain a cmake build environment I wouldn't say it should be rejected outright. Speculating about it without an implementation to compare seems like a waste of time.
Especially when jaromil already has a mostly-functional autotools setup. It needs tweaking still and some changes to catch up and rebase, but it works. He also already did the tedious work to rearrange the source tree to make adding any auto-configuration tool for the build environment easy to drop in place. (Which is already merged.)

I've actually offered (on irc) to fix the latter a few times and been told that a pull removing implementations from the headers would not be merged so have not wasted the effort. (Because it's a rather large one.) Not only does this cause long build times it makes adding new code in the logically "right" places nearly impossible due to the build deps.
I agree with pretty much the entirety of your post and think all of it needs to be discussed further and addressed.

In light of recent events in the "bitcoin community" I have decided that private disclosure of issues is doing nothing but making them more prevalent.
In light of this decision I would like to report multiple CSRF vulnerabilities in  .
This set of CSRFs are particularly nasty since this is hosted on appspot and uses google account auth. So long as you stay logged into your google account you are vulnerable to this CSRF.

Oh ya, forgot this tidbit. Thanks gmaxwell!:
Not mentioned here is that fact that dozens of MTGOX hashed passwords were quietly disclosed on a hash cracking forum on Fri Jun 17, 2011 5:21 am ( post by "georgeclooney")
Since the overwhelming majority but not all of the hashes match the mtgox database that was posted on this forum (now deleted) and elsewhere I suspect that this post may have been generated from an earlier dump than was disclosed on the forums and everywhere else after the big event.
This appears to be significantly ahead of the prior claimed breach, and is consistent with the great many other mtgox users claiming that their accounts were robbed prior to the big event on Sunday, which I believe would have been too early to be results of the mtgox database leak according to the official timeline re: auditor compromise.

Honestly, until I read the quoted part of your response, I actually wasn't in favor of this whole thing since in general the types of issues being mentioned are, in large part, the types of issues that maintainers deal with all the time.
The fact that you're even trying to package and/or at some point have packaged and shipped big endian binaries is straight up *NEGLIGENT.*
Stop that. Now. It won't work.
Thanks for showing that this *is* necessary, I guess.
