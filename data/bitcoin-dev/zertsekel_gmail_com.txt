Hi guys,
I wonder why automake has become the build system for Bitcoin Core?
I mean - why not cmake which is considered better?
Can you please point to the relevant discussion or explanation?

Well, here are some quotes about CMake build tools...
JetBrains (2014)
Our brief research showed that CMake and ?make? were the most popular
cross-platform tools, having ~30% of users each, while both Autotools
and qmake had less than 7% of users. So we ended up with CMake and make.
KDE Project (2006)
Now the next big change is happening: KDE is leaving the aging "autotool"
build chain behind. Some developers, not only in KDE, like to nickname
the autotools as "auto-hell" because of its difficult to comprehend
architecture. So, KDE 4 will feature a completely different build system:
Also, there are more advanced build systems:
 - Meson [
 - Ninja [
All of them (CMake, Meson, Ninja) had a goal to replace automake.
Was there any discussion about choosing the best build system for
Bitcoin Core?
