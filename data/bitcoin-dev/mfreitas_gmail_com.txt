@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] New P2P microblogging project based on Bitcoin 
Hi folks,
I'd like to let you know about a new project based on Bitcoin + Libtorrent:
twister - a new p2p microblogging platform.
First of all, some kudos and apologies are due. Bitcoin and libtorrent are
both well written, high quality C++ codebases and i'd like to thank all
developers for their work.
Apologies are for bastardizing those codebases and (forcibly) merging them
together in order to try my P2P ideas. I wouldn't be able to have something
working in just a few months if i did it differently. So the least I could
do in retribution is offering write-access to the repository for bitcoin
and libtorrent developers (for those who want it, of course).
I won't add more details here because the site has plenty of information
and i'm sure some people will not be interested anyway as we get offtopic.
