@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Censorship 
Regardless of the XT debate, centralization on reddit and bitcointalk has become a critical issue for the bitcoin community. A few anonymous people control both these forums, giving them unprecedented power to manipulate discussion, alter reputation, ban users, and even to facilitate scammers in the name of getting profits. Protecting the de-centralized spirit of the Bitcoin community is no longer on their list of priorities, in fact those in charge have publicly stated centralization is necessary. It doesn't matter how many thousands of posts you contributed or if you've traded thousands of Bitcoins, if one of the few who control reddit and bitcointalk decide to get rid of you there's nothing you can do. Bitcointalk has done more damage to my reputation than any other website I've ever used, and I only used it for a year. The damage wasn't even from the scammers, but rather those in charge of the community posting false allegations with zero evidence, and enforcing a guilty until proven innocent policy. Even when such allegations are definitively proven incorrect and allegations cease the posts stay on the internet forever, another site crawls all the bitcoin discussion and saves it. It's not an isolated incident either, happened several times to me before I realized how detrimental it was to even post there, and I've seen countless other members receive the same treatment. There is no doubt that the centralization and censorship of the Bitcoin community is massively inhibiting the advance of Bitcoin and also the growth of the Bitcoin economy. We are scaring away intellectuals, businessman, and newbies that are just getting started. It has put us in a very dangerous position, the community has been weakened, and there is the possibility that the forums could be handed over to the government at any time due to their centralized nature.  I am creating a de-centralized forum, and I mean truly de-centralized as I nor anyone else will be able to control it. I am already writing the code and I'm confident it won't be long until a basic release is out. I am certain this will be very positive for the Bitcoin community, and the rest of the world since centralization is getting stronger everyday. The world needs this to level the playing field, it will be impossible for anything to be deleted on this forum even if the NSA attacks it. No one will be banned ever. The only rule is there are no rules.  If anyone is interested in this feel free to email me back. I am doing this for zero profit and without any pay, just out of passion, so I don't mind getting as much people as possible involved. -----Original Message-----

People are wondering why there is such a division in the bitcoin community at this time. Bitcoin as a whole is only so big. The bitcoin discussion communities are spread out, but there are only a few popular ones. BitcoinTalk and Reddit seem to be the largest, most popular where bitcoin discussion happens consistently and from almost everyone in the community (devs, users, btc companies, merchants, and so on). I think we all know where this is going. If not, here you go. BitcoinTalk and Reddit are managed by a single person: Theymos. It's become quite clear over the past several days/weeks, that Theymos is highly censoring bitcoin discussion, mainly on Reddit, but also BitcoinTalk. If this single person is able to censor content, and hush the debate, he (and whatever his agenda is), wins. How can we as a community discuss these proposed changes, if the discussion is from a one sided point of view? There doesn't seem to be a solution at this time, but I find it dissapointing that many (in this very email list) aren't discussing this important part of the issue. Maybe it's becuase Theymos is anti-bigger blocks, which seems to coincide with the Blockstream point of view, which many of the core devs belong to.

When I say de-centralized I mean it, all the things you listed are centralized. Reddit is actually a purely centralized system and just as unhealthy as the current bitcoin forum. We have the technology, I'm simply putting together the pieces that other people have already built. This forum will literally be uncontrollable in raw form, once it's unleashed it can't be stopped. It will exist on thousands of computers so it cannot be destroyed, it will not be centrally hosted. I expect users to create their own external software to parse the data, so people can centralize as much or as little as they want in their own 'sub-forums' built on this system. I will be releasing some very rudimentary external software/website to go along with this de-centralized system just so people can post and read what's posted, and will worry about the finer details at a later time.
There will be various leaders who utilize this program and organize quality forums, but fundamentally the raw de-centralized system cannot be controlled, so people posting to it will always have a venue to speak without being censored.
I actually started this project to create a journal of uncensored scientific research, but it didn't take long to realize this sort've thing is useful for pretty much everyone, so I'm rushing the basic release out. Then I will work on making my science journal 'sub-forum' software and everyone else can do whatever they want. -----Original Message-----

The de-centralized forum directly integrates the Bitcoin blockchain with every post. I can see how you misunderstood since I wasn't specific in my first email. I'm surprised no one has done this yet, people have done things very similar but never took the leap to integrate the actual Bitcoin blockchain. Basically  but with a parallel program that stores most of the data in a hash reference table, and shares that data via a torrent-esque system.

Yup I've been looking over twister thoroughly this week, it's very close to what I'm thinking and I'm sure the developer of that could easily do the project I'm doing. However he decided to make an alt coin and didn't use the real blockchain, which makes his network weak. It's a waste to not take advantage of the immense bitcoin computing power for this. I'm only planning on storing hashes in the blockchain though to prevent data bloat, and the parallel program which stores all the data will be a lot like twister. Additionally I'm going to take it beyond a messaging system, will be able to literally upload anything and everything to this system. Theres no limit to what this de-centralized system can do if designed correctly. Crypto graffiti has given a taste of that by uploading jpeg and png to the blockchain. Will be working on this 24/7 until the first release, will definitely tell you and others when the code is ready to be looked over.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] AT&T has effectively banned Bitcoin nodes by closing 
I have been struggling to get port 8333 open all year, I gave up and was using blockchain for months despite a strong desire to stay on Bitcoin Core, but now the issue has reached critical mass since I'm using the python Bitcoin server module. I have literally spent my entire day trying to open 8333, I thoroughly made sure it was open on the router and computer and it's still closed. Strangely enough I got it open for 30 seconds once today but something closed it immediately.
After hours of phone calls and messaging AT&T finally told me the truth of what was going on, and only because I noticed it myself and demanded an answer. The internet is being routed through a DVR/cable box, and they confirmed the DVR also has a firewall. To make this even more absurd they refused to turn the firewall off because it is their equipment. So effectively they can firewall any port they want even if the customer asks them not to, in the unlikely event the customer figures it out.
Perhaps this is the driving force behind the inexplicable and massive decline in Bitcoin nodes. Bitcoin is being censored by the ISPs themselves, and they won't even tell you that. I had to get in touch with headquarters and threaten to rip it out of the wall to get a proper answer.

The only reason someone would want to make a license is so they can sue/threaten people for not following the license rules. At best this is pointless since Bitcoin cannot be controlled, and at worst it will result in a group of people using coercion against the community to gain profits.  There is no legal ground for anyone to make a Bitcoin license, it simply wouldn't stand in court. Not even the MIT license is valid or meaningful. But I wouldn't be surprised if people tried scaring people with a license even if they knew it was invalid.
    It's actually disgusting that you wrote what people are allowed and not allowed to do with Bitcoin. Pure centralization ideology. Maybe go work for the government and make regulations instead of trying to centralize one of the only de-centralized things left on the planet.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] AT&T has effectively banned Bitcoin nodes via 
I was about to buy a VPS for Bitcoin, but I really do need Bitcoin Core for business reasons so I didn't give up. I once again thoroughly went through my computer and made sure there was nothing blocking 8333, a couple useful tools are CurrPorts and TCPView. I went through the router to make sure there was no block of port 8333. I researched everything thoroughly and was sure these were the right settings, but Bitcoin was still getting throttled every second and stuck in sys_sent, and python kept saying the target was rejecting the connection.
I finally stumbled upon subnet settings, and saw that I had a private subnet, one of the few IPs that are private on earth (  ). Uverse put all their customers on a private subnet by default. This made my computer not only hidden but unroutable for any computer on the Bitcoin network. That alone is enough to totally stop Bitcoin connections on any port, but they made it even crazier by generating a dynamic IP that changes all the time, so public IP was meaningless for my computer. I switched over to a public subnet, and right there was a checkbox to allow incoming connections. My static IP showed for a minute then became dynamic/hidden again without me even touching anything. The final roadblock was AT&T charges $15-30/month for a public static IP, which is obviously insane and actually one could argue that violates their own terms of service. So the router was still ignoring my public IP settings simply because I wasn't paying for a public IP, and intentionally changing the settings back. I asked for a free public IP and there was no response for awhile.
I found this article on cryptocoinnews while working out:  It's based on the first email I sent, and was displayed prominently on their front page. I posted a tweet publicly about it which referenced AT&T (  ) and believe it or not I had a static public IP and port 8333 was open about 1 minute later. I don't know if it was a coincidence cause I already messaged them to please do that an hour before, or if that article and tweet spurred them to action. The timing was so ridiculous I think it's the latter. Without twitter I probably wouldn't have succeeded, the technicians on twitter actually answered all my questions 24/7 unlike phone technicians which were clueless and trying to sell me a subscription for connection services help. And shout out to cryptocoinnews for making this public. So to clarify, it appears AT&T has not blocked port 8333 itself, but rather effectively blocked all ports via the private subnet, which makes the computer hidden and unroutable for incoming peers. Although this severely limits functionality and cripples the ability to run a full node and many other programs it is understandable, since it just about 100% prevents hackers from getting in, since they can't even see your computer. What isn't understandable is that AT&T technicians did not inform me about this until I changed the settings myself, despite the fact it is a very obvious cause of ports being blocked. It's probably just ignorance since AT&T has so many complex network settings it's hard to keep track of, although I have a suspicion that someone in their command chain is withholding information in an attempt to make them buy a $15/month connection service, and once they buy that another $15-30/month is needed to get the static IP.
As far as I know there is no easy to find info on the internet about private subnets crippling the ability to use Bitcoin. I believe this needs to be explicitly said in instructions for running a full node, maybe it wasn't a problem in 2009 but now it is a major issue. On default settings Bitcoin is 100% blocked, and most people do not have the time or motivation to fix this. I talked to at least 10 AT&T technicians and worked on it 2-3 days straight, did not receive the right answer until I found it myself, although they certainly gave me some useful clues about how the network works.
I am very happy that AT&T fixed it, since other ISPs like Comcast appeared even worse. I openly talked with them about Bitcoin and they showed no prejudice, might've actually made them more willing to help me cause otherwise they would think I'm a hacker.
tl;dr The good news is anyone with AT&T can be a full node by getting a public static IP, the bad news is almost no one will figure this out unless we as a community make it well known. I guarantee node numbers will improve if this information is spread to everyone. Database size and computing expenditures is simply not the reason people don't run full nodes, it's because their ISP has made it just about impossible without shelling out nearly 100% more money per month. If you don't pay the fee AT&T would never tell you about the private subnet, at least based on my experience.

First off I couldn't synch the wallet, it said no block source available and there was zero connections. Bitcoin was literally getting thottled every second. It would not even allow the connection to get block source. EVERY port was blocked, making exceptions in the router firewall did nothing. I was forced to use Blockchain.info which is a major security risk.
Secondly, I am developing a program using Bitcoin Python modules, so I login to my computer like it's a server and it was flat out rejecting the connection. I could not run any code until this got fixed, and of course needed the block source to even do anything. If Bitcoin Core worked but 8333 was blocked I would not be emailing the list. Bitcoin Core was crippled and unusable due to the AT&T settings, and they tried hard to get me to buy monthly subscriptions to get the answer. This makes it likely that Bitcoin Core is unusable for most AT&T customers and other ISPs, hence the massive node decline. I'm sure this disrupts alot of other people besides Bitcoiners too, hence the monthly subscriptions geared towards people who can't figure out their connection situation.
AT&T literally blocked access to static IP if you don't buy one, so it wasn't a normal network setup. Unfortunately the same security used to stop hackers and viruses stops Bitcoin too, so this is probably the settings for almost every router in the country. Nodes are in fact declining worldwide, down 15% in the past year alone. Community needs to speak up and also educate before this gets completely out of control.  6,000 nodes is pathetic as it is and it's constantly declining.

Respectfully, what the heck are you talking about? Practically every home LAN
runs on a private subnet. My own desktop computer has the IP address
192.168.1.34, which is in a private subnet. This doesn't prevent my Bitcoin Core
node from making outbound connections to other nodes. Moreover, almost all home
Internet connections in the world run on dynamically assigned IP addresses.
Again, this does not cause any problems for connecting outbound to other Bitcoin
nodes. It's true that your node can't accept incoming connections unless you
forward port 8333 on your router to your computer, but you don't need to be able
to accept incoming connections to participate in the Bitcoin network.

Literally everything you said is incorrect. It is completely on topic as it pertains to Bitcoin Core functionality, 42 connections is nothing, and that's not how you fix it. If you're gonna call me out for being wrong at least be correct! I spent a lot of time fixing this and the info is useful cause this problem happens to a lot of people, so why obfuscate it with this nonsense. AT&T u-verse as it is now is near impossible for bitcoin nodes, 42 in the world is absolutely pathetic considering they are among the top 2 ISPs in the USA. Thanks for proving my point.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] AT&T/ISPs making Bitcoin Core near impossible to use 
not by specifically blocking 8333 or Bitcoin as stated in original email
I sent out an email after 48 hours of dealing with trying to open up my ports for Bitcoin, I was quite frustrated and angry since I had to call like 10 times and I was making zero progress. Most of the AT&T people didn't give me any helpful clues on how to fix the situation. The original email described how there is a firewall in the DVR, and I thought it was blocking the ports. It is true there is a uncontrollable firewall in the DVR, it is false this blocks 8333.
The actual problem is due to AT&T Uverse customers being forced to use a private dynamic IP, the IP is literally hidden from the internet, so it isn't possible to send any requests at it. It will literally ignore pings across all ports. So the solution is to switch to public static IP and make sure you allow incoming traffic. It's not so simple though, AT&T will not let you have a public static IP without paying. I've had my router reset 10 times today by AT&T (probably automatically) and it comes back with a private dynamic IP. Then I have to reset it to use public IP and that lasts less than an hour. It literally went from open to closed while typing this email... the IP address went from public to private dynamic. This is making using Bitcoin Core almost impossible. I'm at least getting some synch now but maybe a few days of blocks the entire day, cause I can't sit here all day with the computer and keep fixing it.
The proof is in the pudding, there are 37 nodes using AT&T in the ENTIRE world. AT&T is a massive ISP so this is strong evidence that using Bitcoin Core as a full node on AT&T is extremely difficult and actually just about impossible.
The other big ISPs have pathetic numbers also due to the same sort've things that AT&T does, but at least Comcast has 400 nodes. AT&T is much harder to use than any other ISP I've dealt with when it comes to Bitcoin Core.
I apologize for sending out the wrong info the first time, although it is still worth noting the DVR firewall is out of your control, which might be a problem if not now then in the future. In any case AT&T has effectively blocked full nodes for Bitcoin Core via the private subnet, and the disability to change it to public without paying $15 more per month, and buying a $15 connection service so they will give you that info (if you dont pay the connection 'specialists' hang up on you). It is important to note this is not Bitcoin specific, but effects every program that depends on freely open ports. I don't think AT&T has anything against Bitcoin, it's just their security settings and policies have disabled Bitcoin Core for most customers. Also important to note this isn't a problem specific to AT&T, all the big ISPs are doing similar things. I believe the changes in ISP protocol are the main driving force behind the massive decline in Bitcoin nodes. Another big factor is firewalls, most people can't even remove the firewalls enough to open ports at will. The community needs to educate people on how to use Bitcoin Core when facing these intensifying security measures, or the decline of node numbers will continue.
