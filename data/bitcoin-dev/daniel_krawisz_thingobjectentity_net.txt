@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Coinbase reallocation to discourage 
The memory pool is just talk. There is no expectation that the memory pool
has to satisfy some standard as to what will eventually exist in the block
chain, and there are any number of ways that people could communicate
transactions to one another without putting them in the memory pool. The
memory pool can't be treated like a contract because there is no
cryptography to enforce it--there is no contract until the transactions
appear in the block chain, inherently.
Mike Hearn's proposal is nonsense because it requires miners to develop a
concensus on which blocks in the block chain are dishonest. There is no way
to prove cryptographically that a block is dishonest because the block
chain itself is the concensus system--before there is concensus, there is
no concept of dishonesty, at least as far as double-spending goes. In order
to decide that a block is dishonest and reallocate the coinbase, a prior
consensus mechanism would be required. Of course, such a consensus
mechanism would also be subject to attacks just like the block chain.
Maxwell's proposal is very good. One only trusts the oscar not to double
spend, which is perfectly reasonable if oscar is a well-known service.
Normal everyday wallets for immediate payments would simply require a
little more infrastructure.
