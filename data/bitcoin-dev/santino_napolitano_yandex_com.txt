Gavin has been very clear about the fact that he's on vacation. I'm not sure what you want Mike to say. It's obvious the Bitcoin Core developer pitchforks are out for him so there isn't really anything he can possibly say which will be constructively received on this highly adversarial and increasingly ridiculous charade of a mailing list. I feel as though they've made their case abundantly clear to anyone paying attention.
The community will weigh the independent merit of the two points of view and that community is not as naive and uninformed as everyone on this list likes to portray them to be. Your concern for companies' welfare is appreciated but I'm confident they can manage their own independent assessments of this matter as well as seek out enough varied expert opinions such that they can make an informed decision.

I disagree. I think all client-side adoption of SW reliably tells you is that those implementers saw value in it greater than the cost of implementation. It's possible what they valued was the malleability fix and didn't see the limited potential circumvention of MAX_BLOCK_SIZE material to their decision.
They could just as easily attach an OP_RETURN output to all of their transactions which pushes "big blocks please" which would more directly indicate their preference for larger blocks. You could also let hand-signed letters from the heads of businesses explicitly stating their desire speak for their intentions vs. any of this nonsense. Or the media interviews, forum comments, tweets, etc...

There is much heated debate going on right now and I know it can be very stressful but I'd like to point out that it is really amazing how passionately so many feel about this once very small project. Let's not forget there is something really special going on here and we're all part of it.
The current debate has little to do with block size or hard-forks, IMO. It's about the nature of Bitcoin and what it means to people and how it will grow. I would like to take a moment to share my interpretation of the original author's intent based on everything I could find and read from this person. This is not to say their original vision is paramount-- or even that I got it completely correct but I think it might do us some good to think about.
It seems as though the incentive conceived of for running a full network node was that it would enable mining. The proceeds from mining (new coins and transaction fees) would be the reward and provide a reason to continue operating these nodes. If fees are ever to be a sufficient reward and still allow for a practical and useful system the size of the blocks must grow significantly as must the user base. I'm not sure that this is really contested but I haven't exhaustively reviewed everyone's opinion so please excuse me if I have marginalized you. If you do contest that I would be interested in hearing it.
Further, it appears clear that the original author intended organizations operating full network nodes would provide connectivity to light clients and these light clients would make up the majority of the user base. This is completely consistent with current trends in Internet consumption, e.g. tablets and phones are becoming more preferred to even owning a traditional computer. Having the system be entirely decentralized and trustless for every client does not appear to me to be the original design goal. Yes, the whitepaper speaks of the design goal as not having a need for a trusted third party but it does not say that some amount of trust won't be preferred by a majority of users. In fact, in the SPV section it implies some amount of localized trust is perhaps a necessary trade-off and maybe businesses should still run their own full network node if they want the stronger completely trustless guarantee. The global decentralized consensus appears meant to make the network resilient to a single government or other adversary's ability to shut the network down. If you really want to trust no one it is your option at a cost and should be possible by design. The author further gives evidence that they believe Moore's observation would keep the idea of running a full network node a practical one at global scale for perpetuity. It does not appear as if they intended for every individual to run one at home nor in their pocket.
If my interpretation seems incorrect please do point it out. I hope this hasn't been too off-topic and distracting. The original author's engineering ingenuity is what gave me any interest in this project so re-visiting their design and scaling intentions might be helpful for us to move forward-- together.

Is the security concern that a newly announced block may not actually reflect a valid block (but valid enough to trick the client; i.e. it appears to link to the best-work chain) in an attempt to defraud the light client?
Like I pointed out, I'm not sure the goal was _perfect_ decentralization. The author seemed primarily keen to avoid having a single organization with direct control over the ledger. I think your specific fear could be mitigated by the light client peering with a node the light client somewhat trusts -- or at least one which has no incentive to cooperate in some attack against it which requires non-trivial mining expenditure. The IP would be logged and the fraud could be taken to a court if the light client chooses a node in the proper jurisdiction. I think for many use cases that might be sufficient. If it's a more serious transaction other nodes could be consulted.
If my reasoning is in error please correct. I'm sure many of you are much better at game theory than I.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] This thread is not about the soft/hard fork 
While this isn't really the place to discuss it, I respectfully disagree. Mike appears to be making a point concerning Bitcoin protocol authorship and on the perceived value of soft-forks. It doesn't look like simple trolling to me. Mike and Gregory are both extremely intelligent and well-versed in Bitcoin and both should be listened to earnestly and equally while receiving our full professional respect.
At this stage it's becoming readily apparent to at least me (and without putting words into his mouth it would seem Gavin has experienced a similar realisation; please correct if I'm mistaken) that Bitcoin protocol authorship and individual implementation development need to be separated asap. I have no suggestions for the structure of this separation but as soon as it happens the better, IMO. It's likely messages like this would then no longer be seen on this list and Bitcoin Core developers could focus on their implementation's development free from distraction while other implementers and Core developers could discuss protocol issues in a more relevant forum in a more civilized and constructive manner.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] On bitcoin-dev list admin and list noise 
I'm not intending to completely dismiss your concerns but as a data point: I read this list daily and it usually takes 15 minutes or less while I drink a cup of coffee.
My concern is that this is one of the (maybe *the*) last uncensored persisted forums related to technical bitcoin discussion with wide viewership. It is increasingly difficult for an average somewhat technical person to attempt to hold the bitcoin development community accountable for its actions or have their voice heard. It would really be a shame if messages like this were relegated to a black hole where things like the exchange rate and various scammy spam goes to fester.
Who will draw this line? It's unclear to me who the list admins are.
