I thought the integrated miner was retired a version or so ago - I dontrecall seeing it for some time in bitcoin-qt
Now you can buy a USB stick for $20 which can be pushed to around 500MH/s, and  there's no reason the manufacturers couldn't ship those with a miner-program onboard !

With lots of people having access to 100TH+ there's not really much 'cost' to doing a 51% attack on an alt-coin beyond a short-term diversion away from 'profitable' mining.
At least by supporting merged mining, more miners are likely to 'support' multiple coin types, thus making a 51% attack from an individual/group less straightforward.

Unless A1 gets orphaned and B1 gets accepted, in which case all the work done on A2 is 'wasted'.
The question is whether there is any 'real' advantage over time for A over B.
She mines longer on *a* block which *may* become the valid block, yes.
Then the simple 'fix' would be for the block-acceptance to take into account either the total transactions or the total fees, and for the the 'accepted' block for mining the next block to be the one with the lowest hash of one of those values if 2 are released to the network at the same That is of of course assuming there is really a problem to fix, currently I'm not convinced.

Some people may want it all ...
Balance at Point-In-Time summaries (say up to the penultimate difficulty adjustment) would be one simple way.
And make new-adopters get up and running in minutes not days, which can only be a good thing.
If going that route, then solutions to the 'consolidate addresses/wallets' question and formal 'discard' of addresses could get

Not quite true, as I said balance-at-point-in-time would solve that (and make the storage requirements much lower)
For bitcoin to grow beyond interesting experiment into global everyday use a number of things would have to happen, not least of which is taking 'average punter' into account. Whilst new ideas can filter into the general consciousness over time,sometimes concepts have to go with 'what already works' :)
People's concept of money hasn't really changed in over 1,000 years - it remains 'something of known value i can exchange for something else'.
No-one outside of bitcoin dev's and early adopters really gets the one-shot concept of addresses - possibly rightly so - keeping issues of it lowering levels of anonymity etc out of the discussion - it doesn't fit with the mindset people have - it's difficult enough getting merchants to setup separate addresses for each client, one per transaction is simply a waste (of addresses, storage, blockchain size, numnber of inputs|outputs when spending etc)
I'm sure the wife would love a new handbag everytime she gets some money, but the real-world just isnt like that ;)
Addresses are perceived as the equivalent of a jar you stick your coins in. You can have lots of jars. Each jar can be for a specific reason or whatever, but the analogy is there.
Wallets are like a box you keep some of your jars in. With the added interesting concept that a jar can be in multiple boxes at the same time. Only the person with the right 'key' can open the jar and take the However unlike the 3 money boxes I have behind me right now - which i can take 1 single penny out of one and put it into another - if I want to move bitcoins from one addresses (jar) to another *of my own* I have to pay a fee. Worse still if the jar doesnt have much in it I'm denied that ability.
End user will neither understand why or want to pay the fee, for dealing with their own coins.
If a jar breaks I can just tip the contents into a new one - unless I'm very careless, the amount in the new one = the amount in the old one - people will want/need it to work like that.
Similarly if you do have all these addresses around, you may want (as good housekeeping) discard some of them (after moving the cash).
So having the ability to specify address to send from is essential (and a sadly missing feature of the QT client)
'intra-wallet' transfers with an 'also discard the sending address' would be a way of (once confirmed) stopping any further use of that address (denied any further transactions by miners ?) and when balance-at-point-in-time is implemented, a way of shrinking the storage for all other bitcoin users (who chosse not to have a full transaction If i send luke 10, and luke sends me back 3, i have 3, luke has 7.
If luke sends me 2, and i send luke 1, i have 4 and luke has 6.
To verify my ability to send jeff 4, all that is needed is to know that I have 4, not all the transactions that led to that state - thats how its done now, thats not necessarily efficient as bitcoin grows
If luke sends me 4 more, i now have 4 again, luke has 3
If i send 1 to each of the children, they have 1 each (*4)
Having a 'family' wallet means when on holiday they can have that rental of quad-bikes - to send the rental company 4 the client only needs to know that those addresses now have 1 each in them, not all the previous transactions - if they didnt exist at the point-in-time balance, then yes, it would need to know about the luke>rob>kids transactions, but thats all
I moved to a new netbook recently - it took 140 *hours* to d/load and process the blockchain (yes the wifi was that bad), I heard from one of our clients that (although they only had the client running during working hours) that to their desktop it was over 9 days before it had caught up.
If all I was d/loading were the transactions since the last difficulty change (as one example of a fixed point), and the remaining balance on any not-discarded address as at that point it would have been much much quicker, and not be shagging my shiny new hard drive.
There's more but it's 4.45 in the morning, and I cant think coherently until after a few hours kip and some good coffee :)

In most regions it's not only 'simple' but trivial - BTC is just 'another currency' and accounted for exactly the same way - it doens't matter if you sell your hose for GBP, USD, EUR, BTC or sacks of Pig Dung, you still have a GBP tax issue ...
You want to volunteer to pay tax ? I'd suggest stronger medication ...
80% of 'donations' end up spent on 'adminsitration' and not what they were donated for, this is a 'greed' issue not a 'currency' issue.
Tax isn't voluntary or a donation. The 18% who think UK tax is well spent are the 18% of the population who get the tax money, not the 82% that pay it ;)
First we kill all the politicians ...
So give it to the FD - what you do with your post-tax profits are up to you ;)
Where does gov't come into this ? I think you're confusing 'tax' which you have zero control over and 'donations' which you already have 100% control over.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] "bits": Unit of account 
The use of any 'prefix' is one of choice and entirely unnecessary, and there
are already established 'divisions' in u/mBTC for those that feel they need
to use such things.
Exceptionally unlikely - I deal every day with currencies with 0, 2 and 3
dp's in amount ranging from 'under 1 whole unit' to tens of thousands - Not
once in 20 years has anyone ever 'sent' more or less than intended - oh,
they've 'intended' to underpay just fine, but never *unintended*.
I propose that for people unable to understand what a bitcoin is, they can
just use satoshi's and drop this entire proposal.
