# Notes
* On the advice of my lawyer, I'm currently offering only a specific version of
  the DPL. I probably will offer licenses under subsequent versions in the
  future, but I'd prefer to see how the DPL evolves and whether or not the
  license stewards behind it prove trustworthy before committing to doing so.
* The language "all technology companies I control" is there to avoid any
  complications with non-technology companies that I may control in the future,
  e.g. family real-estate holding companies, and the non-profit caving group
  I'm a part of. To my knowledge, I only control one company as of writing, the
  numbered company I do all my consulting through; I consider that company a
  "technology company", and thus the above offer applies to it.
* Equally, if by some stroke of luck I do end up in control of any other
  technology companies - maybe Bill Gate's blockchain smart-contract will
  mysteriously gives me control of Microsoft - then the above offer will apply.

Softforks and hardforks are usually defined in terms of block validity (BIP99): making valid blocks invalid is a softfork, making invalid blocks valid is a hardfork, and SFs are usually considered as less disruptive as it is considered to be ?opt-in?. However, as shown below this technical definition could be very misleading. Here I?m trying to redefine the terminology in terms of software upgrade necessity and difficulty.
Softforks are defined as consensus rule changes that non-upgraded software will be able to function exactly as usual, as if the rule changes have never happened
Hardforks are defined as consensus rule changes that non-upgraded software will cease to function or be severely handicapped
SFs and HFs under this definitions is a continuum, which I call it ?hardfork-ness?. A pure softfork has no hardfork-ness.
*Mining node
Under this definitions, for miners, any trivial consensus rule changes is somewhat a hardfork, as miners can?t reliably use non-upgraded software to create blocks. However, there is still 3 levels of ?hardfork-ness?, for example:
1. Those with lower hardfork-ness would be the SFs that miners do not need to upgrade their software at all. Instead, the minimum requirement is to setup a boarder node with latest rules to make sure they won?t mine on top of an invalid block. Examples include CSV and Segwit
2. Some SFs have higher hardfork-ness, for example BIP65 and BIP66. The minimum actions needed include setting up a boarder node and change the block version. BIP34 has even higher hardfork-ness as more actions are needed to follow the new consensus.
3. Anything else, ranging from simple HFs like BIP102 to complete HFs like spoonnet, or soft-hardfork like forcenet, have the highest hardfork-ness. In these cases, boarder nodes are completely useless. Miners have to upgrade their servers in order to stay with the consensus.
*Non-mining full node
Similarly, in terms of non-mining full node, as the main function is to fully-validate all applicable rules on the network, any consensus change is a hardfork for this particular function. However, a technical SF would have much lower hardfork-ness than a HF, as a border node is everything needed in a SF. Just consider a company has some difficult-to-upgrade software that depends on Bitcoin Core 0.8. Using a 0.13.1+ boarder node will make sure they will always follow the latest rules. In case of a HF, they have no choice but to upgrade the backend system.
So we may use the costs of running a boarder node to further define the hardfork-ness of SFs, and it comes to the additional resources needed:
1. Things like BIP34, 65, 66, and CSV involves trivial resources use so they have lowest hardfork-ness.
2. Segwit is higher because of increased block size.
3. Extension block has very high hardfork-ness as people may not have enough resources to run a boarder node.
* Fully validating wallets
In terms of the wallet function in full node, without considering the issues of validation, the hardfork-ness could be ranked as below:
1. BIP34, 65, 66, CSV, segwit all have no hardfork-ness for wallets. Non-upgraded wallets will work exactly in the same way as before. Users won?t notice any change at all. (In some cases they may not see a new tx until it has 1 confirmation, but this is a mild issue and 0-conf is unsafe anyway)
2. Extension block, as presented in my January post (  ), has higher hardfork-ness, as users of legacy wallets may find it difficult to receive payments from upgraded wallet. However, once they got paid, the user experience is same as before
3. Another extension block proposal (  ) has very high hardfork-ness for wallets, as legacy wallets will frequently and suddenly find that incoming and outgoing txs becoming invalid, and need to sign the invalidated txs again, even no one is trying to double spend.
4. Hardfork rule changes have highest hardfork-ness for full node wallets
I?ll explain the issues with extension block in a separate post in details
* Real SPV wallet
The SPV wallets as proposed by Satoshi should have the ability to fully validate the rules when needed, so they could be somehow seen as fully validating wallets. So far, real SPV wallet is just vapourware.
* Fake SPV wallet, aka light wallet
All the so-called SPV wallets we have today are fake SPV according to whitepaper definition. Since they validate nothing, the hardfork-ness profile is very different:
1. BIP34, 65, 66, CSV, segwit has no hardfork-ness for light wallets. Block size HF proposals (BIP10x) and Bitcoin Unlimited also have no hardfork-ness (superficially, but not philosophically). Along the same line, even an inflation hardfork has no hardfork-ness for light wallets.
2. Extension block has the same kind of hardfork-ness issue as I mentioned.
3. HFs that deliberately breaks light wallets, such as spoonnet, is a complete hardfork.
While some people try to leverage weakness of light wallets, the inability to validate any important rules like block size, double spending, and inflation is a serious vulnerability.
Before I finish, I?d also like to analyse some other interesting cases.
1. Soft-hardfork: which requires miners to mine empty blocks with 0 reward, and put the tx merkle tree in the legacy coinbase (e.g.  ). This allows most hardfork-ing changes including block size and inflation. In terms of block validity this is a softfork. But with the definition I presented, soft-hardforks are clearly hardforks for every practical purposes.
2. On-chain KYC, blacklist, account freezing: technically softforks, but all are very disruptive hardforks in terms of user experience.
3. Lightning network and side chains are not consensus rule changes, and they could provide new features without any hardfork-ness.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Inquiry: Transaction Tiering 
agreed, the 'miner' term has run its course and plays a different role than it was originally set out to do, esp its original distributed nature. the 'mining business' has become concentrated too much and resembles today's financial institutions or simply banks, imho.
still, any form forking has dilutive effect on existing BTC holders.

Thanks, those are valid concerns.
That is the idea. Transaction Processors could source transactions
from the public mempool as well their proprietary mempool(s).
Not so, a user may want to incentivise a specific Transaction
Processor or many. A user can detect this behavior and withdraw his
future business if he notices that his transaction is not included in
a block despite there being transactions with lower fees included.
Remember, the transaction can be advertised to different mempools and
a Transaction Processor could lose this business to a competitor who
processes the next block if he holds it back.
Best Regards
PS: It seems not too late to get rid of misleading terms like "miner".
Block rewards (infrastructure subsidies) will be neglectable for
future generations and the analogy is exceedingly poor.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] New difficulty algorithm needed for 
Yes, I agree. Hard forks should be as much scrutinized by fellow bitcoiners, i.e. developers and holders and not only rushed by miners or some other investment gurus, whose incentives are not entirely clear, to remain as decentralized as economically possible.

The problem of fast acting but non vulnerable difficulty adjustment algorithms is interesting. I would certainly like to see this space further explored, and even have some ideas myself.
However without commenting on the technical merits of this specific proposal, I think it must be said upfront that the stated goal is not good. The largest technical concern (ignoring governance) over B2X is that it is a rushed, poorly reviewed hard fork. Hard forks should not be rushed, and they should receive more than the usual level of expert and community review.
I?m that light, doing an even more rushed hard fork on an even newer idea with even less review would be hypocritical at best. I would suggest reframing as a hardfork wishlist research problem for the next properly planned hard fork, if one occurs. You might also find the hardfork research group a more accommodating venue for this discussion:
Welcome - Bitcoin Hard Fork Research
Bitcoin Hard Fork Research This website will be updated with relevant ongoing information about Bitcoin hard fork research. Resources: BIP-MMHF, draft patch last ...
Sorry, my previous email did not have the plain text I intended.
The bitcoin difficulty algorithm does not seem to be a good one. If there
is a fork due to miners seeking maximum profit without due regard to
security, users, and nodes, the "better" coin could end up being the
minority chain. If 90% of hashrate is really going to at least initially go
towards using SegWit2x, BTC would face 10x delays in confirmations
until the next difficulty adjustment, negatively affecting its price relative
to BTC1, causing further delays from even more miner abandonment
(until the next adjustment). The 10% miners remaining on BTC do not
inevitably lose by staying to endure 10x delays because they have 10x
less competition, and the same situation applies to BTC1 miners. If the
prices are the same and stable, all seems well for everyone, other things
aside. But if the BTC price does not fall to reflect the decreased hashrate,
he situation seems to be a big problem for both coins: BTC1 miners will
jump back to BTC when the difficulty adjustment occurs, initiating a
potentially never-ending oscillation between the two coins, potentially
worse than what BCH is experiencing.  They will not issue coins too fast
like BCH because that is a side effect of the asymmetry in BCH's rise and
fall algorithm.
Hard fork to implement a new difficulty algorithm that uses a simple rolling
average with a much smaller window.  Many small coins have done this as
a way to stop big miners from coming on and then suddenly leaving, leaving
constant miners stuck with a high difficulty for the rest of a (long) averaging
window.  Even better, adjust the reward based on recent solvetimes to
motivate more mining (or less) if the solvetimes are too slow (or too fast).
This will keep keep coin issuance rate perfectly on schedule with real time.
I recommend the following for Bitcoin, as fast, simple, and better than any
other difficulty algorithm I'm aware of.  This is the result of a lot of work the
past year.
=== Begin difficulty algorithm ===
# Zawy v6 difficulty algorithm (modified for bitcoin)
# Unmodified Zawy v6 for alt coins:
# # All my failed attempts at something better:
# # Keep negative solvetimes to correct bad timestamps.
# Do not be tempted to use:
# next_D = sum(last N Ds) * T / [max(last N TSs) - min(last N TSs];
# ST= Solvetime, TS = timestamp
# set constants until next hard fork:
T=600; # coin's TargetSolvetime
N=30; # Averaging window. Smoother than N=15, faster response than N=60.
limit = X^(2/N); # limit rise and fall in case of timestamp manipulation
adjust = 1/(1+0.67/N);  # keeps avg solvetime on track
# begin difficulty algorithm
avg_ST=0; avg_D=0;
for ( i=height;  i > height-N;  i--) {  # go through N most recent blocks
avg_ST += (TS[i] - TS[i-1]) / N;
avg_D += D[i]/N;
avg_ST = T*limit if avg_ST > T*limit;
avg_ST = T/limit if avg_ST < T/limit;
next_D = avg_D * T / avg_ST * adjust;
# Tim Olsen suggested changing reward to protect against hash attacks.
# Karbowanek coin suggested something similar.
# I could not find anything better than the simplest idea below.
# It was a great surprise that coin issuance rate came out perfect.
# BaseReward = coins per block
next_reward = BaseReward * avg_ST / T;
======= end algo ====
Due to the limit and keeping negative solvetimes in a true average,
timestamp errors resulting in negative solvetimes are corrected in the next
block. Otherwise, one would need to do like Zcash and cause a 5-block
delay in the response by resorting to the median of past 11 blocks (MPT)
as the most recent timestamp, offsetting the timestamps from their
corresponding difficulties by 5 blocks. (it does not cause an averaging
problem, but it does cause a 5-block delay in the response.)
