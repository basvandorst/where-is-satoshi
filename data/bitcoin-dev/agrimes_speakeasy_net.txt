Yeah, I'm starting to run into real design problems in my attempt to write a bitcoin daemon, namely I'm trying to figure out how to manage connections and peers and how to interpret and coordinate messages from While spying on the old code, I noticed one major problem that could be fixed quite easily. That is, the 1 class-per .h/.cpp rule is completely ignored in main.h/cpp and net.h/cpp If all of the classes in the project were re-factored to their own files, it would be much easier to audit what was interacting with what. I think this work could be done within 16 programmer hours.
The old codebase doesn't build on my system but I'd be willing to rough it in anyway.
I think this should be done in parallel to efforts, such as mine, to re-implement major functionality.

Lets look at:
This is OK as a super high-level overview, but it leaves a great deal to be explained.
First what is the status of this? Is it fully implemented? A working proposal? An approved proposal? etc...
I am working on the peer and the wallet boxes in this diagram. I want to implement my own version because the existing code is completely untrustworthy, it is totally slap-dash and almost completely uncommented.
My questions related to the peer are these:
It is taken for granted that the peer will have a listening component that accepts connections from other peers.
Does it also have an active component? If so, what operations does it perform autonomously?
and credit! =( (GetDebit(), GetCredit())
Interesting... What is the exact relationship between the wallet and the miner? (The miner is irrelevant to me until I have a wallet I can trust enough to experiment with...)
After reading the dox on libdb, I'm leaning towards an inetd implementation. That is, inetd handles all the dirty work with regards to connections, and spawns off a server for each client. This minimizes the quantity of code at the cost of a wee bit of overhead (maybe 10k per process). Basically, the penguin acts like the KoAC in Katamari Damacy, if you don't do it in the regal old-fashioned way, he rains down thunderbolts on you and you get to write 3 or 4 times as much code.
The upside is that each peer is served by a single completely isolated process with extremely simple and highly auditable code.
A general problem that I haven't seen any documentation on yet is that most of today's operating systems are properly multi-user systems. Naturally, each user would keep his wallet in an encrypted store in his home directory. Are there any standards yet for users to set up their personal wallet daemon that connects to a system-wide peer node and provides an interface for only their own GUI?

To those who think there are too many vanity versions of bitcoin, all I have to say is this:
atg at tortoise ~/source/bitcoin/src $ make -f makefile.unix
