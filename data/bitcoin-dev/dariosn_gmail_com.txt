Something like this might also be useful for several use cases related to
RBF. For example:
Alice sends Bob an RBF-activated transaction T1 with the intention of
bumping its fee if necessary. Bob wants to send these funds to Carol, but
cannot wait until T1 confirms, so he crafts a transaction T2 that spends T1
using SIGHASH_NOINPUT, and pays Carol. Carol can now make sure she receives
the money even if Alice fee-bumps T1, as long as the outputs of the
replaced transactions are compatible.
Extra care should be taken to avoid rebinding, maybe by including an extra
input in T2 that doesn't use SIGHASH_NOINPUT.
