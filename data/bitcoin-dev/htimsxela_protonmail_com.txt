@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP: Bitcoin Integrated Address Feature? 
I see two immediate issues with this:
1. Increased resource requirements per transaction
2. Embedding identifying information into the blockchain is generally bad for privacy
It may help your case to provide some technical details of how you'd like to see this implemented, but without overcoming the issues mentioned above I think this proposal will be a very tough sell.
I am not sure if I see how this issue is solved by your proposal. Assumedly, a human will still need to manually approve cold-wallet withdrawals in order to maintain security. So it seems to me that removing the 'hot-wallet' component of the backend would only amplify the need for human interaction.
I assume you are familiar with hierarchical deterministic wallets? They can allow an exchange to assign/identify user deposits based on address derivation path. Keys for deposit addresses can be kept offline if wanted, and a proper implementation of an HD wallet system should also remove the need for rescans of user deposit addresses.
There is also a functionality built into Bitcoin that allows a user to prove that they own the private keys to some address: signing an agreed upon message using the private key that controls that address. Unfortunately I don't think this is a workable solution for you, since the majority of modern wallet software does not include this feature-- but perhaps worth mentioning nonetheless.
