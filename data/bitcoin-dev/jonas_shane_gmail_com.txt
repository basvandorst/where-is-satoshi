@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Add OpenRPC Service Discovery To JSON-RPC Services 
Similar to how Bitcion has BIPs to normalize bitcoin wallets, this is a
proposal to normalize the Bitcoin RPC Interface.
Just one example of the problems that arise: If a client doesn't provide
getblock or doesn't work in the same way it will have
unintended consequences .
Having a standard described interfaces lets you generate documentation,
generate RPC clients, test interfaces, across implementations.
Here is the proposal:
Here is just an example of what something like that would look like for

There?s a BIP to create a standard API document for the Bitcoin JSON-RPC API here?s an example of the generic ethereum api and another example of just the wallet interface here?s a live demo with interactive documentation:
Creating a standard api document like this makes it a lot easier to build dev tools and documentation.
I?d love to help document the bitcoin JSON-RPC API, let me know how I can help.
