Okay so I quite like this idea. If we start removing at height 630000 or
840000 (gives us 4-8 years to develop this solution), it stays nice and
neat with the halving interval. We can look at this like so:
B - the current block number
P - how many blocks behind current the coin burning block is. (630000,
840000, or otherwise.)
Every time we mine a new block, we go to block (B-P), and check for stale
coins. These coins get burnt up and pooled into block B's miner fees. This
keeps the mining rewards up in the long term, people are less likely to
stop mining due to too low fees. It also encourages people to keep moving
their money around the enconomy instead of just hording and leaving it.

Ok, I see your point. I was just thinking about the number of bitcoins tied
up in wallets in which people lost the keys, but I suppose this isn't so
much of a problem if it's well known that the bitcoins are all tied up. It
would be impossible to distinguish between bitcoins people have lost access
to, and bitcoins that people have just left in the same wallet for a long

Very true, if Moore's law is still functional in 200 years, computers will
be 2^100 times faster (possibly more if quantum computing becomes
commonplace), and so old wallets may be easily cracked.
We will need a way to force people to use newer, higher security wallets,
and turning coins to mining rewards is better solution than them just being

I think a slight problem with this is that wallets (often ones made by
third party wallet software) do not fully empty. I don't know how often
this happens, but some wallets, even if you tell them to send all funds,
leave a small fraction of bitcoin remaining. If this is the case, it could
be detrimental to the 'pruning idea', as wallets with any coins left cannot
be pruned. For example:
A has 1 BTC
A -> B -> C
If these wallets are not removing all the BTC, and a fraction is left over,
B will not be able to be pruned out of the chain. On the other hand, of the
wallets are completely emptied, the new 'pruned block' will be able to show
A sending 1btc to C.
This could be a problem, and so we need a way to persuade people to get
their wallets to send everything instead of leaving a small fraction left
over. I don't know how problematic this could be, or how frequently this
happens, but I'm just putting it out there.
