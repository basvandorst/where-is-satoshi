@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] An implementation of BIP102 as a softfork. 
This is an interesting approach but I don't see how this is a soft
fork. (Just because something is not a hard fork, doesn't make it a
soft fork by definition)
Softforks don't require any nodes to upgrade. [1]
Nonetheless, as I understand your approach, it requires nodes to
upgrade. Otherwise they are missing all transactions but the coinbase
transactions. Thus, they cannot update their utxoset and are easily
susceptible to double spends...
Am I missing something obvious?

All of this is already implemented in the bitcoind and bitcoin gui.
The theoretic minimum for the prune target would be 0 (just the header
of the current best block) as Bitcoin Core already stores the
chainstate (about 2 GiB) regardless of what you set for -prune=.
In practice, the minimum is 510, so reorgs and small rescans (may not
be implemented in 0.12) are still possible.
The clients won't let you set it below that target:
"Prune configured below the minimum of 550 MiB. Please use a higher number."
Also, keep in mind Bitcoin Core comes with a help message explaining
-prune and other command line options

2016-03-03 16:28 GMT+01:00 Peter Todd via bitcoin-dev
It is planned for Bitcoin Core 0.13 to use -maxtxfee for both, the
wallet and the RPC interface (sendrawtransaction). (c.f.
In regard to the issue, I agree with Jonas. Such large transaction
fees were historically caused by no or insufficient warnings from the
wallet software. And it's the responsibility of the operators to make
the wallet user friendly.
Apart from that, there are legit use cases where one would want to
"pay" a large transaction fee: It may be convenient for the miner to
just collect the fees instead of sending back the change on their own
transactions. Of course making sure to mine the high-fee tx themself.
Moreover, it could increase privacy if another party decides to "wash"
their bitcoins by letting the miner claim the "fee" and then have the
miner send back a fraction of the fee to a fresh address. Though, this
probably works best if a lot of participants are doing this.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Amend the BIP 123 process to include buried 
I define a buried deployment as a consensus rule change that affects
validity of blocks that are buried by a sufficiently large number of
blocks in the current valid most-work chain, but the current block
(and all its parents) remain valid.
BIP 123 suggests that BIPs in the consensus layer should be assigned a
label "soft fork" or "hard fork". However, I think the differentiation
into soft fork or hard fork should not be made for BIPs that document
buried deployments. In contrast to soft forks and hard forks, buried
deployments do not require community and miner coordination for a safe
For a chain fork to happen due to a buried deployment, a massive chain
reorganization must be produced off of a block in the very past. In
the extremely unlikely event of such a large chain reorganization,
Bitcoin's general security assumptions would be violated regardless of
the presence of a buried deployment.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Amend the BIP 123 process to include buried 
Consensus is not trivial. I think documentation is important, even if
it seems simple to some.
Personally, I don't care too much where to place the documentation,
but the BIPs repo seems a good place, since it also hosts other
informational documents.
To prevent "two BIPs for every protocol change", related buried
deployments could be bundled. E.g. the ISM BIP 90 change.
Sufficiently large to prevent potential bike-shedding. The expected
number of blocks in two weeks could be considered a lower bound. Then
multiply that by 10 or 20.
Note that a checkpoint *freezes* the chain completely at a given
height. Buried deployments are *not* checkpoints.
Also note that buried deployments only make sense after a protocol
upgrade has happened (i.e. a soft fork or hard fork). If a miner has
the resources to cause a chain split, they could trivially do that
even in the complete absence of buried deployments. Buried deployments
are *not* a solution to 50% attacks.
Please note that a buried deployment can very well be a soft fork. I
think this makes it even clearer, that such a label makes no sense for
buried deployments.

Hi, and thanks for the detailed issue report.
This was a known issue in test code that is only compiled when
debugging. It will be fixed in the upcoming 0.16.2 and 0.17.0
If you see any further issues, note that we track technical issues
related to the Bitcoin Core code base on our issue tracker:

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] IsStandard 
============================== START ==============================
There is not a single document that describes what is standard and
what is not. Transaction relay policy (including minimum relay fees)
may change over time, across different implementations or different
versions of the same implementation.
Generally you can assume that commonly used scripts that are standard
today remain standard. To test if a script is standard and accepted by
current relay policy of a Bitcoin Core node, you can create a tx that
spends from it on mainnet or on testnet and see if it is accepted to
the mempool of your local node. Make sure to disable
-acceptnonstdtxn=0 on testnet.
Should the standardness-rules of a script type ever change, it will be
announced and discussed on this mailing list.
And of course, lightning transactions are standard as they otherwise
wouldn't propagate.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Removal of reject network messages from Bitcoin Core 
Bitcoin Core may send "reject" messages as response to "tx", "block" or
"version" messages from a network peer when the message could not be accepted.
This feature is toggled by the `-enablebip61` command line option and has been
disabled by default since Bitcoin Core version 0.18.0 (not yet released as of
time of writing). Nodes on the network can not generally be trusted to send
valid ("reject") messages, so this should only ever be used when connected to a
trusted node. At this time, I am not aware of any software that requires this
feature, and I would like to remove if from Bitcoin Core to make the codebase
slimmer, easier to understand and maintain. Let us know if your application
relies on this feature and you can not use any of the recommended alternatives:
* Testing or debugging of implementations of the Bitcoin P2P network protocol
  should be done by inspecting the log messages that are produced by a recent
  version of Bitcoin Core. Bitcoin Core logs debug messages
  (`-debug=`) to a stream (`-printtoconsole`) or to a file
  (`-debuglogfile=`).
* Testing the validity of a block can be achieved by specific RPCs:
  - `submitblock`
  - `getblocktemplate` with `'mode'` set to `'proposal'` for blocks with
    potentially invalid POW
* Testing the validity of a transaction can be achieved by specific RPCs:
  - `sendrawtransaction`
  - `testmempoolaccept`
* Wallets should not use the absence of "reject" messages to indicate a
  transaction has propagated the network, nor should wallets use "reject"
  messages to set transaction fees. Wallets should rather use fee estimation
  to determine transaction fees and set replace-by-fee if desired. Thus, they
  could wait until the transaction has confirmed (taking into account the fee
  target they set (compare the RPC `estimatesmartfee`)) or listen for the
  transaction announcement by other network peers to check for propagation.
I propose to remove "reject" messages from Bitcoin Core 0.19.0 unless there are
valid concerns about its removal.

Windows will no longer be provided. Please let us know if and why you

* There is an experimental Bitcoin Core snap package in the snap

for each major version branch that is not yet EOL. While the snap
package uses the signed release binaries, I am not aware of a way to
generate the hash of binaries in an installed snap that works on any
Linux distribution. (On some distributions, a call to `sha256sum
