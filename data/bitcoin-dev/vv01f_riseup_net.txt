@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] moving the default display to mbtc 
I think
* if we change to mBTC because your state currencys price for bitcoin
make this a valid option we will change again in future
* users do not like changes
* we should keep a good standard
A good standard should be
* built on standards (e.g. SI)
* backed by best practice: never force the user to take an option he
cannot change
* do not make changes without users permission
* take care of users at fault when entering 5.967 ot should be pointed
out before sending that e.g.
the sw understood 5967.000 000 00 BTC
instead of 5.967 000 00 BTC
because the user failed to use the correct delimiter.
For now a good standard is
* simply bitcoin as BTC with eight decimal places
or could be
* uBTC as SI prefix, probably using XBT as a symbol for compatibility
with other software
* satoshis (w. SI prefixes if numbers are to big) for regions where
decimal places in prices are uncommon
So I'd prefer:
Make the choice transparent to users and set a standard that the user
alway should be empowered to use all available decimal places.
And there should be a set of official test-cases for wallet software and
the desired behavior.

Companies can have a Cert with their name via CAcert. It requires some work though to get assured as an organisation.
Did you already think about what CA is to be trusted or do users need to do that. The least good decision in my POV would be to accept OS/browser built in CAs only.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] secure assigned bitcoin address directory 
Some users on bitcointalk[0] would like to have their vanity addresses
available for others easily to find and verify the ownership over a kind
of WoT. Right now they sign their own addresses and quote them in the
As I pointed out there already the centralized storage in the forums is
not secury anyhow and signed messages could be swapped easily with the
next hack of the forums.
Is that use case taken care of in any plans already?
I thought about abusing pgp keyservers but that would suit for single
vanity addresses only.
It seems webfinger could be part of a solution where servers of a
business can tell and proof you if a specific address is owned by them.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Export format for xpub 
First that is a pitty .. as its simply a waste of storage.
but back to Pavol's point: IMHO no harm to anything, as Bitcoin never
has any valid timestamp below ~1230768000 (jan2009) and thus will always
have 10 digits.. you can easily identify 8 char long timestamp as the
proposed format.
And there never is anything wrong with having a transparent, human
readable option - especially when it saves 2 bytes in e.g. qr-codes.
