@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Proposal: rewarding fees to next block miner 
If miners leave transactions out of a block they do pay a cost by not being
rewarded those fees.  If they include their own spam transactions to get
back the fee they gain nothing.  Since blocks can have fees resulting in
hundreds of thousands of dollars, it would seem unlikely that miners incur
a huge cost for not including transactions.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] How accurate are the Bitcoin timestamps? 
The terms "simple ordering of blocks" and timestamp are essentially the
same thing.
