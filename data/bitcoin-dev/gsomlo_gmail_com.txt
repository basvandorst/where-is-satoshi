@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] RFC: Sandboxed Bitcoin network ? 
I've been looking for a way to set up a self-contained, sandboxed
network of Bitcoin peer nodes, for testing and experimentation. Think
a bunch of networked VMs, or containers inside a network simulator
like GNS3 ( or CORE (
Neither 'main' nor 'test' are feasible, due to hard-coded assumptions
they both make about their respective publicly shared blockchain state.
Right now, that leaves 'regtest' -- however, connecting peers together
over the sandboxed network in regtest mode is a manual process.
After some tinkering, the following changes make 'regtest' behave
similarly to "the real thing", but inside an isolated sandbox network:

Additionally, for this network to behave realistically, I need peers to
actually mine blocks on their own once connected together, so I reverted commit 8d1de43 and re-added the 'setgenerate' triggered internal miner.
At this point, I have a few questions for the Bitcoin dev community:
  1. would a realistic sandbox test mode be interesting enough to make
     it worth supporting upstream? (happy to submit patches and do
     revisions if there's interest, and a chance for success)
  2. if yes, support modifying 'regtest' mode accordingly via some sort of
     command line flags, or rather implement a dedicated 'sandbox' mode
     with its own CChainParams defaults?
  3. finally, would re-inserting the internal 'setgenerate' miner be a
     deal breaker?
Any other thoughts and comments also much appreciated!
Thanks much,
