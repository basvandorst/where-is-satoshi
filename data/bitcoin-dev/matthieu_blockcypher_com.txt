Github has a nice feature that lets you link to a specific line of code:
Is it the line you're referring to? It just flags the peer as at that point
we know we don't have more addresses to learn from it (peers send 1000
addrs). The previous
applies for peers sending an addr message that would have more than
1000 addresses, which is disallowed to prevent flooding. And no number is
both greater and lesser than 1000 :)

Thanks for the bug report Simon, "responsible" disclosure on public forums
is always appreciated. We're working with ShapeShift to make sure we can
protect them appropriately against this specific attack in the future. As
"Me" and Adrian advised, I would also encourage you return the funds.
Regarding Peter's accusations on Twitter/Reddit/listserve, we have no idea
why we are his target. He has never met with our CEO, has no idea of our
business model, nor our company objectives. All his comments about us are
his speculations. I'm sure Peter knows what a Sybil attack actually is and
making such claims on a public forum is completely unfounded and uncalled
for. Stretching definitions beyond the point where they make sense is a
common rhetoric and political tool, not necessarily appropriate in a
professional or technical context.
We offer useful services for many startups like ourselves. We are good
actors in this space. As a startup we are also constrained by limited
resources (we're funded but far from larger companies resources). Companies
aren't built in a single day and we hope to do more to help
decentralization in the future as well. We're trying to further the
ecosystem with our small team, so the pot shots are puzzling.

Our "identities" aren't pseudonymous.
In the case of Bitcoin, there's something like 6,000 nodes, so if that
You're not talking about a Sybil attack anymore, just resource use. We do
know how to change default configurations to offer more connections.
If you are achieving that via incoming connections, you're placing a big
We're not Chainanalysis and we do not run hundreds of distinct nodes. Just
a few well-tuned ones.
That's a matter of opinion. One could argue your actions and control
attempts hurt decentralization. Either way, no one should play the
decentralization police or act as a gatekeeper.
Question: Do you have relationships with mining pools? For instance, are
No, we do not. We do not know anyone else having such contracts. As you
know, Coinbase also denied having such contracts in place [1]. But you seem
to have more relationships with mining pools than we do.

Not strictly speaking a wallet but we (BlockCypher) will also go down the
segwit path as soon as the BIP and branch are mature enough.  All
transactions built from our APIs should eventually be segwitted (just made
up a verb).
