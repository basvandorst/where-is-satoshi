@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Considering starting a toy full-node implementation. 
I'm considering to start developing a toy full validating node implementation (no wallet, no mining) for educational purposes.
Some questions:
1) which resource do you suggest for as a reference for the protocol?
2) which part do you suggest to start with?
3) I was thinking to use btcd as a reference since I'm not familiar with C++ (bitcoind)
4) are there any other general advice or tips for such endeavours?
Thanks in advance.
