There are good, valid arguments in support of promoting both the reference
client, Bitcoin-QT, and for offering a lighter-weight alternative. Why not
outline these arguments on bitcoin.org and provide links to each; or even
links to a variety of alternative wallet solutions alongside descriptions
of their respective benefits and drawbacks? Is there an advantage to having
a singular "recommended" client?
