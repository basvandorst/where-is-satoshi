@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Modularizing Bitcoin 
One of the primary upcoming priorities for bitcoin?s infrastructure, beyond the bloom filter, will be the continued modularization of the system.
Here at the Bitcoin Grant, we would like to jump start this development with a financial incentive and initiate an ongoing conversation on how we can work together towards developing a smarter, more efficient system of tomorrow, today.
Up for grabs: 500 bitcoins or $500,000; whichever is greater.
Taking on a project of this scope is a highly intensive, technical undertaking and we believe excellent developers should be compensated as such, especially when it comes to open source projects.
One of the main goals will be to separate the wallet from the node, as we have already done with mining. This way, the wallet, which will only hold private keys and create transactions, would pass transactions directly to a relay node, based on the bloom filter. Meanwhile, the block node will maintain the block chain and validate and relay new blocks.
Such developments would significantly strengthen the system. Modularization would make cancer attacks less likely and increase the node count, which, currently, is fairly low.
This is by no means is a feature request, merely ideas as to initiate a discussion. We welcome any feedback or suggestions. And of course, let us know if you would like to contribute to this project by submiting a grant proposal.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Message Signing based authentication 
Passwords are inefficient by design: frequently we hear news from Sony, Square Enix, Adobe, and various others about passwords being compromised, databases being copied and stolen. This story remains true in the Bitcoin space. In light of the recent Bitcointalk forum breach echoes an increasing need for passwords to become a thing of the past.
In celebration of the 5 year anniversary of the Bitcoin whitepaper, we are delighted to introduce the Message Signing based authentication method.
In brief, the authentication work as follows:
Server provides a token for the client to sign.
client passes the signed message and the bitcoin address back to the server.
server validates the message and honors the alias (optional) and bitcoin address as identification.
Above is a proof of concept forum that utilize this authentication method. Following Kerckhoffs's principle, this forum only stores the signed message and bitcoin address the users provide the first time they use the site, both are public information. In addition, there is no database, everything is simply an RSS feed. For the sake of usability we have included a redis for the sessions, at the cost of additional exposure to potential risks: users no longer need to sign a token every time they wish to post.
All source code will be available on github in the next few days. We welcome any feedback or suggestions.
