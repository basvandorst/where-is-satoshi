I wonder if you need to take into consideration the fact that there might
be another "bad" pool (in the 1-Q part of the network) running the same
strategy and also holding on to two blocks of their own? Once they find
their third block before you do, then your 2 blocks lead is gone instantly.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] User vote in blocksize through fees 
I'm imagining in Peter's proposal it's not the transaction votes that are
counted but only the votes in the blocks? So miners get to vote but they
risk losing money by having to exclude counter voting transactions. But
garbage transactions are no problem at all.
Note that users that want to cast a vote "pay" for that by increased
confirmation time (on average, hopefully slightly depending on the trend).
