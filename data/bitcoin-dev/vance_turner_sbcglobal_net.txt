@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Intersection of file system work based on Mandelbrot 
I have been working on filesystem based on Mandelbrots formula, and it seems
that it is a prime candidate for extending the bitcoin algorithm.
Would like to run some of this by you folks. The key is that the Mandelbrot workers could help to modify the verification
work so that the brute force work in the current hash.
It would allow the hash results to reign in the next iteration.
Also the hash results could help to build a fast lookup table of future
variations of the block chain.
