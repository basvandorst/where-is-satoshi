Wladimir has no more or less ?power? to push change to the Bitcoin Core codebase than any other person with commit privileges to the GitHub repo. If I?m not mistaken there are 7 people with commit privileges and five of them are active. If Wladimir committed a change it could be reverted by any of the others. This is by design and ensures that changes will have reached some level of technical consensus before they are merged, among other things.
Furthermore even assuming the Core Maintainer commits a change to Bitcoin Core (that isn?t reverted and that gets packaged up into the next code release) that still doesn?t push a change to the bitcoin network. There is no auto-update on Bitcoin Core so individuals and companies running Bitcoin Core software have to choose to upgrade. Further still, developers that maintain alternative implementations would have to decide to merge those changes to the codebase they are indepently maintaining (and their users would need to update, etc.).
I understand why it might *seem* to be the case that the Core Maintainer is empowered to make changes to "teh Bitcoin" but the reality is that the Core Maintainer role is really about cat herding and project management of Bitcoin Core the open-source software project and not the bitcoin network. We?re lucky Wladimir has agreed to take on so much of the scut work to keep the project moving forward.
The process might get ugly and inefficient but that?s the cost of having no wizard behind the curtain.

The core maintainer has always been in control of the consensus rules.  Satoshi came up with the rules and put them in there. Since then any  changes to any part of the code go through the core maintainer. It  looks to me as if people are saying it somehow changed along the way  because they don't want to hurt people's feeling, upset up, get them to  quit, etc. Sure there are checks and balances and people don't have to  use the main code base but if they change the consensus rules they are  The notion that because people can download different rules and run them  is interesting from a theoretical perspective but that is constrained by  the network effect. I can say the US government is not the "decider" of  laws because I can vote them out, recall them, challenge things in  court, or secede and start my own country. You can also say the  judge/jury in a criminal court case is not a "decider" because the  president can always issue a pardon. But those points are generally not  useful in a practical sense.
The issue about the developers is the tremendous influence they have to  veto any changes. I don't have veto power yet I have more bitcoins than  garzik says he has. The whole Bitcoin software development system is  subject to attack from just a couple of people who have this veto  power. With all the crying and moaning about centralization on this  list I would think that would be a concern.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Possible change to the MIT license 
This is a poor idea, and agree that it?s largely off-topic. So without
wasting too much of anyone?s time here, I?d point out the following.
It is pretty clear that any developer who is subject to a lawsuit from
someone using Bitcoin Core software could point to the license (among other
things) *defensively* to limit their liability.
But who would be in a position to assert an *offensive* claim that their
license terms have been breached? Who would have a right in the software
that they are granting via the license? Definitely not the Bitcoin
This software is meant to be free and open for anyone to use, unfortunately
that means some people will sometimes do things you disagree with.

to defend itself against attacks of any form.
Agree 100%. Plus yeah, lotsa luck getting any success via those channels...
But assuming the answer to the perceived problem is to ?fight fire with
fire? (using social / marketing based efforts) who ?should? pick up the
mantle here? Without inciting riots by asking the question, wouldn?t that
ostensibly be something the Bitcoin Foundation would lead on here? In any case, it?s frustrating to watch the ongoing FUD and scammery going
unanswered in any ?official? capacity.

If I'm understanding the problem being stated correctly:
"Bitcoin is under a branding attack by fork coins."
The proposed solution is to disincentivize fork coins from using the word
Bitcoin by altering the license terms. I'm not a lawyer, but it seems to me
that the words of the license are basically useless unless there is an
entity that intends to make use of court systems to threaten noncompliant
projects into submission.
In my opinion, the perceived attack on Bitcoin here is social /
marketing-based, thus it makes sense that any defense against said attack
should also be social / marketing-based. I don't think that Bitcoin should
be reliant upon courts or governments to defend itself against attacks of
any form.
