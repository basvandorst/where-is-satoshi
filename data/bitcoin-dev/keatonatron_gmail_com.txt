Why does the template transaction need to be signed in step one and passed
back and forth so many times? What is wrong with:
1. Sender creates unsigned tx with their relevant inputs and outputs. This
tx is passed to receiver.
2. Receiver adds their relevant inputs and outputs and signs their portion
before returning the tx to sender.
3. Sender confirms their inputs and outputs have not been modified, and
signs the remainder of the tx before broadcasting it (or sending it to the
recipient if you want to follow the payment protocol spec).

You are right, I got the wrong impression the first time I read it.
I'm not convinced this is a valid concern, at least not valid enough to add
extra complications to the process. The sender could still refuse to sign
the final transaction after they see the recipient's in-/outputs; "show me
yours and I'll show you mine" isn't much of a spy deterrent, and nothing
here prevents a DOS attack.
As an implementor, I would suggest keeping the protocol as simple as
possible. By dropping the signing in the first step, the recipient doesn't
need to maintain the ability to lookup and verify unspent outputs. It also
would enforce the increased privacy, which the sender obviously wants if
they are going down this path (in other words, either have the process
complete or fail -- don't give the recipient the ability to broadcast the
not-private transaction against the wishes of the sender).

Okay, I see what you mean. I better understand the weaknesses you've
identified, and I can't really think of a better solution than what you've
proposed. I also realized that implementors who aren't capable of
integrating signing and UTXO validation wouldn't be the ones trying to
implement this feature, so my concerns there are also moot. Carry on ;)
