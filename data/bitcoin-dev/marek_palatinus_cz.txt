To my understanding it is purely software thing. It cannot be detected from
outside if miner uses this improvement or not. So patenting it is worthless.

Sipa, you are probably the most competent to answer this. Could you please
tell us your opinion? For me, this is straightforward, backward compatible
fix and I like it a lot. Not sure about the process of changing "Final" BIP

I fundamentally disagree with the concept of driving signing workflow by
the wallet software. Wallet software does not know in advance all data
necessary for the signer to do the job. As Jochen mentioned above, Segwit
vs Non-segwit use cases are a good example, but there may be many.
Currently the TREZOR protocol works like device is a server and wallet is a
client calling methods on it. It's like: "Sign this for me, please", "Ok,
give me this information", "Here it is", "Now I need this another
piece".... "There is the signature". Wallet does not know in advance what
will go next, and it is for sake of simplicity. I'm quite happy with the
protocol so far.
Considering the difference in between current hardware, I really don't
think it is possible to find any minimal URI-based API good enough for
communicating with all vendors. What I see more likely is some 3rd party
libraries (JS, C++, Python, ...) defining high-level API and implementing
hardware-specific protocols and transports as plugins. That way vendors are
not limited by strict standard and application developers and services can
integrate wide range of hardware wallets easily. However, this can be done
already and we do not need any standardization process (yet).

and how the library API would be different form the proposed URI-scheme?
The main benefit is that you don't need "standard" to solve problem, but
use natural tools in given environment and programming stack. Build a
"standard" on top of URI protocol is a huge limitation, which does not give
any advantage.
We already see issues with dead simple "bitcoin uri" standard, it barely
works in most of bitcoin apps. Think of vague definitions of parameters or
ability to send payment requests over it. HW API would be complicated by an
order of magnitude and I have serious concerns that it will be helpful for
anything. So why complicate things.
the only supported hardware communication layer?
Interprocess communication/libraries/dependencies on Android are not bound
to specific transport anyhow. Such library could be used by any android
app, and the library would implement proper transports for various
supported vendors. USB for Trezor, NFC for something different etc. If the
point is "make life of app developers easier", let's do this and do not
define artifical "standards".

On Thu, Aug 18, 2016 at 11:35 AM, Jonas Schnelli This reminds me I have some experience with hardware wallet development and its integration
and I know it's a mess. But it is too early to define such rigid standards
yet. Also, TREZOR concept (device as a server and the primary source of
workflow management) goes directly against your proposal of wallet software
as an workflow manager. So it is clear NACK for me.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP Status updates (including to Active/Final 
As Luke pointed, BIP44 is already used by many wallets and to my knowledge
people don't have any real world issues with that, including loading funds
in another BIP44 wallet. I'm not saying that BIP44 is perfect from all
points of view, but IMO it just works for most use cases. Let's set it as
final, and propose competing standards which cover all your concerns.

I received this:
---------- Forwarded message ----------
I think I change like this makes a lot of sense technically, and I wish I
had known how BIP-32 would end up being used inside higher level mechanisms
that automatically increment the position beyond the control of the
application generating them. The inclusion of the requirement was there
because ECDSA is notorious for security problems under biased secret keys,
though it's really only a certificational issue for secp256k1 (due to its
group order being so close to 2^256).
BIPs are not supposed to be updated with new ideas, only
remarks/links/typos/clarifications/..., so that their bumbers can
unambiguously be used to refer to an idea. My suggestion would be to write
a new BIP that overrides parts of BIP32, and then put a note in BIP32 that
a better mechanism is available that is unlikely to change things in
reality for the secp256k1 curve.
I guess
The chance for failure is a bit higher than that, as it only requires a
failed key (one in 2^128) in the first step, followed by an iteration that
results in the same I_R to cause a cycle. If you take multiple failures
before the cycle starts into account, the combined chance for failure is
p/(1-p)^2 / 2^256 (with p the chance for a random inadmissable key), which
is not much better than 1 in 2^128 for high values of p.
An alternative that always converges is to retry with an appended iteration
count is possible:
  I = HMAC-SHA512(Key = c_par, Data = 0x01 ||  || ser32(i)) for the first
  I = HMAC-SHA512(Key = c_par, Data = 0x01 ||  || ser32(i) || ser32(j)) for
iteration number j, with j > 0

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Making AsicBoost irrelevant 
Ehm, I though those discussions about "ASICs are bad, because X" ended
years ago by starting "ASIC unfriendly" altcoins. ASIC industry is twisted
even without AsicBoost. I don't see any particular reason why to change
rules just because of 10% edge.
This is opening Pandora box and it is potentially extremely dangerous for
the health of the network. You cannot know in advance what you'll break by
changing the rules.
Disclaimer: I don't have any stake in any ASIC company/facility.

On Sun, Oct 16, 2016 at 10:58 PM, Tom Zander via bitcoin-dev <
WIP for TREZOR means that we've made that hard part already (firwmare) so
we know it is feasible, yet we didn't spend enough time on finalizing all
the stack like our web wallet because we don't see any actual release date
yet. Considering current battles on BU hashpower, we decided simply sit and
watch (I already have popocorn).
SegWit is probably the most disruptive and most invasive change ever made to
There're also many wallets which are impatiently waiting for segwit to be
released. Segwit is blessing for hardware wallets for many reasons. I
actually think that rolling out Segwit will increase security, because it
will reduce huge complexity in hardware wallets as it is today.

That was exactly matejcik's point; you can easily write protobuf-compatible
encoder/decoder for such simple structure in about an afternoon, if you
need. Or you can use existing protobuf parsers in matter of minute, if you
don't care about dependencies.
Also, many projects already have protobuf parsers, so it work in other way,
too; you need BIP174 parser as extra dependency/library, although you
already use protobuf library (like Trezor device does). For needs of
BIP174, the difference between ad-hoc format and protobuf is neglible, so
it is a mistake to introduce yet another format.
