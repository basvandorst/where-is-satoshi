@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] "bits": Unit of account 
People in the Bitcoin community are sometimes resistant to the idea of using the word "credit" as a unit of Bitcoin, because Bitcoin is not a credit-based system. However, given that the average person has close to no understanding of what "credit" means, and probably no concern for the distinction even if they do know, it may be wise to use the futuristic and easily understandable "credit" as our human-friendly unit. Do others agree that "credits" as a unit of account has a desirable futuristic connotation?

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] [RFC] Proposal: Base58 encoded HD Wallet 
The spec has been updated a bit.
Even if the bulk of the key-stretching work has been outsourced to another
device, and that device is compromised, the passphrase is now protected by
minimum 8192 rounds of salted PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512.
The idea is that more powerful devices (mobile phones, laptops, etc.) can
do all the key-stretching on their own, whereas weaker devices with access
to another device with more computing power (like Trezors) do a fair amount
of key-stretching on their own, but can safely export the rest of the
key-stretching to the other device.

Gmaxwell pointed out that we could safely front-load all the key
pre-stretching. The spec has been updated to take advantage of this.
The user's password is now protected by 10,000 rounds of salted
PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512, as well as the main KDF (which ranges from scrypt
2^14/8/8 to scrypt 2^18/16/16 and PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512 2^16 to 2^21).

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Proposal: Encrypt bitcoin messages 
What, exactly, do we hope to achieve from having end-to-end encryption?
Even if it worked perfectly, it wouldn't be very useful.
But it won't work perfectly, because we don't have any method of
authentication. The bitcoin network is trivially MITMable. It's designed to
work even in the face of that, but any encryption we implement will just
get blown away by anyone who cares enough to stand in the middle of two
As far as I can see, we get a microscopic obfuscatory advantage over a very
weak passive attacker, at the cost of hugely increased software complexity
(and possibly increased CPU time).
So again; what do we hope to achieve? Why bother? Not a lot of sensitive
information is transmitted in the clear. The little information that might
be considered sensitive is better protected by anonymization (a la Tor),
not encryption.

I'm not. I don't think this proposal is even good.
Again, the NSA might get an absolutely trivial amount of data from
monitoring connections on the Bitcoin network. A bit of publicity is *not*
worth drastically increasing the software complexity of the client.
Enabling hidden service support by default would introduce an insanely huge
attack surface.
And you're conflating two different things; using Tor is valuable to
Bitcoin because it would provide some anonymity. The encryption aspect is
pretty much useless for us.

Not to mention encrypting basically non-sensitive inter-node traffic is
almost completely worthless in providing anonymity anyway...
Seriously, I have not heard a strong justification for this proposal yet. I
have heard some people talking about Tor-ifying communications, but that is
a completely different issue and should not be confused with just
"encrypting bitcoin messages".

It's an iOS application. I would imagine it is substantially more difficult
to attach to a process (which, at the very least, requires root, and
perhaps other things on iOS) than to convince the device to change its

That said, the security benefits might not be too substantial.

People would also abuse this feature in the same way amazon (and other sales sites) abuse the definition of "save". For example, Amazon will indicate that you're getting x% off by shopping at amazon, but all that number really means is x% off MSRP. In reality, every website has the same price. I have no doubt that merchants would put similarly meaningless and/or misleading data in this field. I agree, the memo field is appropriate for this data.

Ok, wanting structured data is a decent argument, but why this random arbitrary case in particular? There are hundreds of fields like this that people might want to use. If we're going to support one random cosmetic field, we might as well support them all with a generic structured data format. I'd rather we just didn't have this essentially pointless "feature" at all. Let's try and keep as much cruft as possible out of the payment protocol. The textual memo field is already more than sufficient.

I agree. It would be even sillier to start specifying container formats for random one-off "that would be kind of nice, I guess" features. How about exchange rate? Sharing links? Referral information? Any of these things are just as deserving of specification (and just as arbitrary).

+1. BIP70 is important. We want to keep it very simple and generalized, or there is a very real risk that implementers will either not bother with it or implement it in buggy, poorly standardized ways. Any information not required by the machine should only exist in human-oriented fields (namely, the memo field). Let's try to avoid ending up with another horrendously complicated, edge-case-oriented protocol like we programmers frequently complain about.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] [RFC] Proposal: Base58 encoded HD Wallet 
This spec offers a lot of benefits over BIP 0038:
* Multiple KDFs (I think the chosen list is reasonable and fits all
required use cases)
* Multiple seed lengths
* Explicit BIP 0032 support
* Creation date field
* Plausible deniability (via the multiple-password mechanism)
I don't think it makes any sense to compare this to BIP 0039. BIP 0039 is
for key import/export, but it doesn't deal with anything like encryption,
wallet creation date, etc. The use cases are completely different.
I don't think we should let BIP 0039 (which is perfectly good for its
intended use case) hold us back from improving on BIP 0038 (which is also
good, but could use some changes).

The proposed BIP uses a bloom filter, so it has both plausible deniability *and

catch something like 99.9975% of typos, despite allowing two different
This is clearly in violation of the spec. You could argue this about
anything in Bitcoin. What if a developer decided to replace SHA256 with
SHA3 in their implementation of a Bitcoin client? Obviously this would
cause issues.

It's a little more nuanced than that. There are *always* at least two
passwords. If the user doesn't want a second password, a random one is
generated for them. A wallet with two known encryption keys and only one
known encryption key are indistinguishable. If compelled to decrypt, there
is no way to prove that the user actually knows a second password.
Yes, the "outsourcing" terminology is a little confusing. The idea is this:
You have a little device, like a Trezor. It has very little RAM and very
little CPU power. However, you want to use a powerful key-stretching
algorithm (like the maximum Scrypt KDF defined in the spec). One way to
implement this is to allow semi-trusted devices (like desktop PCs) to do
all the "heavy lifting". The way the spec is defined, it is easy to have a
more powerful device do all the tough key stretching work without
significantly compromising the security of the wallet.

Yes, that was my chief complaint as well. A compromised computer removes
most of the extra security offered by key stretching (should you choose to
outsource the bulk of your key stretching).
However, I think we have a good compromise, which is the inclusion of a
number of PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512 based KDFs. For anyone who doesn't want to
trust any external device, but also wants to use memory-contrained devices
(that group of people includes me), PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512 is very easy to
implement even on devices that only have a few kB of RAM, and even though
our number of rounds is very aggressive (2^16 and 2^21), it will still run
in reasonable time even on very slow embedded ARM processors.

Precisely. And since the target of this BIP is generally storage wallets
(just like BIP 0038), we figured these were reasonable time scales for
encryption/decryption on slow devices.
Let's say you're implementing a Raspberry Pi based cold wallet printer.
Having the user wait 10 seconds to several minutes is not unreasonable for
a one-time activity, especially when at least this much time is used to
generate entropy, print the wallet, etc.
The same goes for phones. If you're importing a heavily encrypted wallet
into your device, the user won't mind waiting a few seconds or even a few
Plus, as an added bonus, the amount of time it will take to encrypt/decrypt
is highly deterministic, so it's easy to add a nice progress bar to a UI.

Just to clarify on J.P.'s comments:
*If* you choose to outsource StrongH calculation, and *If* that machine is
compromised, then the security of your password is reduced to a single
round of salted PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512. Your private key remains on the trusted
device, no matter what.
Regrettable, but not catastrophic.

Unlikely. I doubt any significant portion of miners in china will continue to mine on a china-specific chain, since it will certainly be outmined by non-Chinese miners, and will be orphaned eventually. More likely is that mining interests in china will make special arrangements to circumvent the GFwOC.
Users who can't access the worldwide blockchain will notice horrendously slow confirmation times and other side effects.
