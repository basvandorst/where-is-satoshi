On github I commented on the BIP43 pull request about adding a
"purpose" of 0' which would correspond to the BIP32 recommended tree
structure for a single account wallet. (m/0'/chain) This will allow
for backwards compatibility and interoperability at least for existing
single account BIP32 implementations like my own. The only issue is
that it would involve a new BIP, and it wouldn't follow the BIP43
recommendation of using the BIP number as the "purpose number", unless

The upcoming release of breadwallet uses the height of the blockchain to
enforce timed pin code lockouts for preventing an attacker from
quickly making multiple pin guesses. This prevents them changing the
devices system time to get around the lockout period.

@_date: 2014-07-24 22:56:26
@_author: Aaron Voisine 
@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Time 
It's based on the block height, not the block's timestamp. If you have
access to the device and the phone itself is not pin locked, then you
can jailbreak it and get access to the wallet seed that way. A pin
locked device however is reasonably secure as the filesystem is
hardware aes encrypted to a combination of pin+uuid. This was just an
easy way to prevent multiple pin guesses by changing system time in
settings, so that isn't the weakest part of the security model.

The problem is if someone moves system time forward between app launches.
The lockout period doesn't have to be all that precise, it just makes you
wait for the next block, then 5, then 25, and so on. Using a well
known time server over https would also be a good option, but the wallet
app already has the chain height anyway.

@_author: Aaron Voisine

Yes, if the wallet isn't up to date yet, it uses the highest estimated
block height from connected peers, but that could be gamed by
controlling the network. The app has blockchain checkpoints in it
though, so you couldn't truncate the chain starting point below that.
The worst case is that you get a 4-5 extra guesses, but as I
mentioned, it'd be easier to just jailbreak the phone if the phone
itself isn't using a system wide pin lock. I just though it was a fun
and convenient way to prevent the system time hack. The system pin is
what protects your wallet in the event of physical theft, and the app
pin is just for when you lend your phone to a friend for a few

A lot more users will be using SPV wallets in the future, and one of
the techniques SPV clients use to judge how likely a transaction is to
be confirmed is if it propagates across the network. I wonder if and
when double-spend relaying is introduced, if nodes should also send
BIP61 reject messages or something along those lines to indicate which
transactions those nodes believe to be invalid, but are relaying
This would be subject to sybil attacks, as is monitoring propagation,
however it does still increase the cost of performing a 0 confirmation
double spend attack on an SPV client above just relaying double-spends
without indicating if a node believes the transaction to be valid.

Pieter, what's actually happening is that the bitcoin-core release has

Due to the strong incentives for consensus, everyone is looking for an
obvious reference point that they think everyone else will also pick, even
though the point itself isn't critical, only that everyone agree on
whatever point is picked. Like it or not, the bitcoin-core release, and by
extension it's committers have a great degree of influence over what the
community as a whole decides to do. If core screws things up badly enough,
yes, the community will settle on some other focal point for consensus, but

Ultimately the only way to insure bitcoin holdings is with an insurer
who themselves holds enough bitcoin to cover replacement of insured

system of re-insurance, where smaller firms are themselves insured
against catastrophic events that might cause a large number of
simultaneous claims. At the top of the chain sits super-cat insurance
firms like Berkshire Hathaway who do actually have the reserves to pay
out in case of such a super catastrophy. This is one of the most

One possible solution that wallets could adopt when blocks fill up, would
be to abandon the p2p network for transaction propagation altogether, and
instead work directly with a handful of the largest miners and pools to get
transactions into blocks. The miners could auction off space in their
blocks with the guarantee that they will be included in the order accepted.
We'd lose the peer-to-peer nature of sending transactions for a federated
service operator style model, but avoid the problem of unpredictable
transaction failure. Also, unlike replace-by-fee, this would allow for
a send-and-forget usage pattern, as well as known up-front fees. Something
like this is certainly what I imagine the large hosted wallet companies
will end up moving to.

adequately handle the situation when blocks fill up, and allow wallet

these would be enough to avoid the need for an XT only hard-fork.
So far BIP100 is the only one that seems to actually be getting any sort of

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] questions about bitcoin-XT code fork & 
Thanks Alex, the work you've pointed out is helpful. Limiting mempool size
should at least prevent nodes from crashing. When I looked a few days ago I
only found a few old PRs that seemed to have fallen by the wayside, so this
new one is encouraging.
I can respond in the PR comments if it's more appropriate there, but I
believe ejecting tx from mempools rather than preemptively refusing them
according to standard network wide propagation rules will result in spotty,
inconsistent tx propagation, and possibly a large increase in tx
re-broadcasts, so if those haven't been addressed they will need to be. It
would also be prudent to run some simulations to see what other issues are
going to pop-up.
We're currently using CPFP already in breadwallet when spending unconfirmed
non-change inputs. A small percentage of hashing power is using it, but
enough to get a transaction unstuck assuming breadwallet's fee calculation
is better than the sender's.
The problem with RBF is that there's currently no way to tell if your tx
has been picked up by miners or not in order to know if you need to replace
it. Miners broadcasting partial block solutions would be helpful in this
regard, but only for tx in the currently-being-worked-on block, not for tx
that won't be picked up until the block after. If miners were to eject tx
that were previously being worked on in favor of higher fee tx, then that
causes another set of problems for wallets that thought their tx was going
to get in but then it doesn't. The other problem with RBF is that users
don't know up front what fee they're actually going to pay which is a big
blow to real world usability. Also mobile wallets will have to sign lots of
tx up front and rely on a service to replace as necessary. And this is all
just on the send side. On the receive side it's much worse since you can't
rely on the sender to do the replacing. The real problem seems to be the
fact that RBF is an interactive iterative process rather than a
send-and-forget one.
What you really need is some way to tell up-front, is a transaction going
to get mined with a high probability? That problem seems really difficult
to solve with fixed-size blocks that are full. If the goal is simply to
reduce or limit the growth of the blockchain, then there are much simpler
solutions, which is why I've advocated for the blocksize increase, followed
by tx selection and propagation rule changes to create fee pressure.

accept 4-confirmations, and put that on the sender to figure out, but the

This is a reasonable vision, but I think we can do better. We can easily

I think we're all agreed that decentralization is priority  It's what
makes bitcoin unique from everything else. So what then is the best way to
have fees reflect the costs? Having a fixed blocksize (fixed production
quotas) is one very disruptive option that would be a significant departure
from what we have today. The way the network today discourages spam and
other low value uses of the blockchain is with minimum relay fees and
transaction selection rules for blocks. This technique is proven, safe, and
can easily be tuned and experimented with. It's also what all bitcoin
software today is designed to work with.

On Sun, Jun 28, 2015 at 9:37 AM, Venzen Khaosan I get the feeling we might be reasoning from different underlying
assumptions, but I don't think you can separate value that way. Those
fundamental properties were chosen to serve the goal of creating a digital
commodity money. They are useful only in as much as they serve ends that
people value. Consensus, security, censorship resistance are valuable
because they are desirable properties for money to have.
If you want to argue that the properties of bitcoin are valuable for other
things besides money, that's fine, but those other uses presumably can be
accomplished with tiny amounts of bitcoin, so don't appreciably increase
I think it depends on what you mean by "adoption". Adoption as a
store-of-value must necessarily increase the market price given the
restricted and eventually fixed supply. If we're talking about merchant
adoption as a payment system, or increased transaction volume, the yes,
these things have no direct impact on the price. They only impact the price
indirectly in as much as they encourage further adoption as a
Increased adoption does strengthen the fundamentals. The most important
fundamental for money is how many other people standardize on the same
money, and want to hold it. This drives it's price in terms of other
commodities. You want to hold what everyone else wants to hold.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Block Size Increase 
As the author of a popular SPV wallet, I wanted to weigh in, in support of
the Gavin's 20Mb block proposal.
The best argument I've heard against raising the limit is that we need fee
pressure.  I agree that fee pressure is the right way to economize on
scarce resources. Placing hard limits on block size however is an
incredibly disruptive way to go about this, and will severely negatively
impact users' experience.
When users pay too low a fee, they should:
1) See immediate failure as they do now with fees that fail to propagate.
2) If the fee lower than it should be but not terminal, they should see
degraded performance, long delays in confirmation, but eventual success.
This will encourage them to pay higher fees in future.
The worst of all worlds would be to have transactions propagate, hang in
limbo for days, and then fail. This is the most important scenario to
avoid. Increasing the 1Mb block size limit I think is the simplest way to
avoid this least desirable scenario for the immediate future.
We can play around with improved transaction selection for blocks and
encourage miners to adopt it to discourage low fees and create fee
pressure. These could involve hybrid priority/fee selection so low fee
transactions see degraded performance instead of failure. This would be the
conservative low risk approach.

I would just like to point out though that it still fundamentally is using

eventual success.

My argument is that the less risky, more conservative default fallback
behavior should be either non-propagation or delayed confirmation, which is
generally what we have now, until we hit the block size limit. We still
have lots of safe, non-controversial, easy to experiment with options to
add fee pressure, causing users to economize on block space without
resorting to dropping transactions after a prolonged delay.

Placing hard limits on blocksize is not the right solution. There are still
plenty of options to be explored to increase fees, resulting in users
voluntarily economizing on block space. It's premature to resort to
destroying the reliability of propagated transaction getting into blocks.
Child-pays-for-parent is useful, but requires the recipient to spend inputs
upon receipt, consuming even more block space. Replace-by-fee may also
help, but users won't know the fee they are getting charged until after the
fact, and it will make worse all the problems that tx malleability causes
We have $3billion plus of value in this system to defend. The safe,
conservative course is to increase the block size. Miners already have an
incentive to find ways to encourage higher fees  and we can help them with
standard recommended propagation rules and hybrid priority/fee transaction
selection for blocks that increases confirmation delays for low fee

Conservative is a relative term. Dropping transactions in a way that is
unpredictable to the sender sounds incredibly drastic to me. I'm suggesting
increasing the blocksize, drastic as it is, is the more conservative
choice. I would recommend that the fork take effect when some specific
large supermajority of the pervious 1000 blocks indicate they have
upgraded, as a safer alternative to a simple flag date, but I'm sure I

I completely agree. Increasing fees will cause people voluntary economize
on blockspace by finding alternatives, i.e. not bitcoin. A fee however is a
known, upfront cost... unpredictable transaction failure in most cases will
be a far higher, unacceptable cost to the user than the actual fee. The
higher the costs of using the system, the lower the adoption as a
store-of-value. The lower the adoption as store-of-value, the lower the
price, and the lower the value of bitcoin to the world.
I concede the point. Perhaps a flag date based on previous observation of
network upgrade rates with a conservative additional margin in addition to
supermajority of mining power.

The only options available today and in the near future that I'm aware of
are of the centralized custody variety, which is pretty bad in my opinion,
but your point is taken.
When we start bumping up against the block size limit, the transactions at
the margins will experience failure in a way that will be unpredictable to
current wallet software. We can slow blockchain growth by increasing fees
alone, without introducing the additional cost of unpredictability around
confirmation failure, which when it comes down to it is just another
(extreme) way to keep usage low. Instead of fees and unpredictable
confirmation, why not just have fees alone. A single, upfront, known cost.
I would argue that the reason gold is not the one world global currency
that it once was is because of those costs. That's why people shifted over
time to gold backed bank notes and eventually fiat.

Peter, BIP75 gives the parties transacting complete control over who they
choose to share their identity information with. This was the entire point
of the proposal. You authorize who you choose to give your payment address
to, and the sender can verify who they are sending payment to. All
communication and payment info are encrypted against third party snooping,
while still allowing asynchronous communication to accommodate ephemeral
mobile connections.
The fact that some people will choose to use this identity information for
AML/KYC purposes doesn't detract at all from the fact that it gives bitcoin

I like the idea of specifying the type of address as a bit field flag.
0x80000000 is already used to specify hardened derivation, so 0x40000000
would be the next available to specify witness addresses. This is

Indeed, this would still be the case when using a new BIPXX to define
adding segwit chains to what were previously BIP43/44 wallets. In this case
retrieval of a BIP44 wallet remains exactly the same as it did before. A
BIP44 wallet can still be recovered with any BIP44 compatible wallet
software. After you upgrade an existing BIP44 wallet to a BIPXX wallet, now
it is no longer a BIP44 wallet. It is now a BIPXX wallet, and can only be
recovered using BIPXX compatible wallet software.
If you are concerned about making a new BIP that fits in the BIP43
framework, i.e. a new purpose number, there's no reason this can't also be
done. You could create a new purpose number YY. Wallets that follow BIPYY
look just like BIPXX, except that they may only contain segwit address
chains, no standard P2PKH address chains.

I can see the advantage of a segwit only scheme, but we will need to
support old derivations anyway for many decades if not indefinitely. People

This is certainly a downside. It has to be weighed against the benefit of
being able to upgrade existing wallets in place. Asking users to create a
new wallet, and replace their recovery phrase backups is an even bigger
problem in my estimation.
What do you think of doing both? A new BIP43 purpose number for segwit only
wallets, but that also specifies 0x40000000/1 for the change/receive index
so that the scheme is compatible with other schemes for upgrade existing
wallets in place? There will certainly be wallet developers who decide to
upgrade in place, but we can standardized both how to indicate segwit
chains, independent of segwit only schemes or upgrade schemes, and still
have the advantages of a new segwit only BIP43 purpose number.

It's easy enough to mark a transaction as "pending". People with bank
accounts are familiar with the concept.
Although the risk of accepting gossip information from multiple random
peers, in the case where the sender does not control the receivers network
is still minimal. Random node operators have no incentive to send fake
transactions, and would need to control all the nodes a client connects to,
and find a non-false-positive address belonging to the victims wallet.
It's not impossible, but it's non trivial, would only temporarily show a
pending transaction, and provide no benefit to the node operator. There are
