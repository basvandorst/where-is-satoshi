privacy, but can we please stick to using cryptography that is up to par
for parts where we can? It's a small constant factor of data, and it
categorically removes the worry about security levels.
SHA256(SHA256) over RIPEMD160(SHA256) versus the incremental increase in
security of having a simpler implementation of segwitness?"
There are several clever ways to exploit even chosen prefix collisions
using the scripting language. One could search for collisions where one
message is some data and the other is a jump over a critical check.
and sidechannel attacks are much, much more common than brute-force breaks.
KEEP IT SIMPLE.
Ask the Iranian nuclear program. Or those brainwallet users.
H(B and C)"  isn't enough, you have to end up with a C public key for which
you know the corresponding private key or the attacker just succeeds in
burning the funds)

For 2^80 they simply generate 2^80 scripts that look innocent, and
2^80 that are not. With high probability there is a collision. I agree
that most cryptanalysis won't work because of the nesting, but 2^80 is
not good.

P2SH is not secure against collision. I could write two scripts with
the same hash, one of which is an escrow script and the other which
pays it to me, have someone pay to the escrow script, and then get the
payment. Some formal analysis tools would ignore the unused
instructions even if human analysis would not.
