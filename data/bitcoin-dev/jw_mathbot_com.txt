@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Human readable format for private keys 
I now have a live demo of using the NATO alphabet and checksums every 4 words.
It does seem remove the stress of attempting to write unambiguous characters  and I think the demo shows it?s actually easier to type with autocomplete when the word dictionary is not involved.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Human readable format for private keys 
Hey Guys,
I?d like to propose a feature to bitcoin to solve the following problems:
- When people read or write private keys it is very easy to mistake a letter or number.
- When entering a private key a mistake isn?t identified until the entire key is entered.
- When an error is made in providing a private key the location of the error isn?t indicated within the private key.
- Private keys stored on paper can be lost if a single character is damaged or poorly transcribed.
The solution I?m proposing has two parts.
First provide an option to use to the NATO phonetic alphabet when displaying or entertaining private keys. To indicate lower case the word should not be capitalized. Capital letters and numbers should be capitalized.
The nato phonetic alphabet is a long-standing international standard (as international as the use of letters and numbers already used in base58) and has been designed to make each letter easily distinguishable when spoken and written.
By using whole words, that are easily distinguishable and from a very short word database (58 well known words that are either the English numbers or words that begin with the letter indicated) the likelihood of errors in recovery are reduced.
The second part of the solution is to insert checksum letters. If every 5th word is actually a checksum for the previous 4 words, you end up with 13 sentences such as:
ALFA tango THREE SIX bravo
In this case bravo is actually a checksum for the previous 4 words and can be calculated and verified as the private key is entered. If the user accidentally trumped BRAVO instead of bravo the checksum would immediately indicate an error within these 5 words (in most cases) making for a greatly improved user experience.
An additional side effect of this is that even if an entire word is lost on multiple lines, the  checksum would probably make guessing the correct words relatively easy.
I realize some of these issues have been discussed in relation to bip39, but I hope this is more likely to be adopted by bitcoin core as it uses existing private keys, has no impact on keygen, does not require a standardized and well known word list for every language, and is essential just a display format that hopefully wouldn?t require invasive code changes.
Thanks in advance for your feedback.

I think the assumption is not that all miners are unprofitable, but that a single miner could make an investment that becomes unprofitable if the hash rate increases more than he expected.
Depending on the cost of the offered insurance it would be prudent for a miner to decrease his potential loss by buying insurance for this possibility.
And the existence of attractive insurance contracts would lower the barrier to entry for new competitors in mining and this would increase bitcoins security.

Oh, I see your point.
However the insurance contract would protect the miner even in that case. A miner with great confidence that he is running optimal hardware and has optimal electricity and labor costs probably wouldn't be interested in purchasing insurance for a high price, but if it was cheap enough it would still be worth it. And any potential new entrants on the edge of jumping in would enter when they otherwise would not have because of the decreased costs (decreased risk).
An analogy would be car insurance. If you are an excellent driver you wouldn't be willing to spend a ton of money to protect your car in the event of an accident, but if it is cheap enough you would. And there may be people that are unwilling to take the risk of a damaged car that refrain from becoming drivers until insurance allows them to lower the worst case scenario of a damaged car.
