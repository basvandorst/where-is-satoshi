@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] A BIP proposal for conveniently referring to 
Hello Clark Moody,
Thank you for your review of our proposal.
For reference please see the pull request:  and the proposed specification:  (I will inform the mailing if a BIP number is assigned and these become obsolete).
On variable length encodings:
We considered in-depth various variable length encodings; and found that for such short data-lengths they all came with a too-high overheard: especially when you design them to work correctly with 5-bit chunks. We will update the rational section of the BIP to include this comment.
Hence, we have proposed the concept of "Display Formats". Display Formats are individually tailored to a particular purpose and thus can be optimised to a much greater extent.
In the case there is a Hard-Fork that extends Bitcoin's Block Transaction Capacity over the 8191 of the provided display format, we will simply define a "Bitcoin Display Format 1". Considering the considerable disruption a Hard Fork causes; the creation of a secondary Display Format should not be of significant concern.
In the case there is a Drive-Chain style extension or other indirect extension to Bitcoin's transactional capacity; it makes no sense to try and define for an undefined format now. We will simply use a new Magic Value and create a tailored Display Format for the new system.
In the case that it is nearing Year 2048, I think that we will be in a far-better position to define a new format that suits the needs of the Bitcoin users than now.
Many thanks for your careful review, it is much appreciated,

I can understand the desire to keep all reference strings to the nice
14-character version by keeping the data payload to 40 bits, but it
seems to place artificial limitations on the format (year 2048 & 8191
transactions). I also understand that this might be addressed with
Version 1 encoding. But current blocks are not that far from having
8191 transactions.
You could go with a variable-length encoding similar to Bitcoin"s
variable ints and gain the benefit of having a format that will work
for very large blocks and the very far future.
Also, the Bech32 reference libraries allow encoding from byte arrays
into the base-5 arrays native to Bech32. It seems like bit-packing to
these 40 bits might be overkill. As an alternative you could have one
bit-packed byte to start:
# First two bits are the protocol version, supporting values 0-3
V = ((protocol version) & 0x03) << 6
# Next two bits are magic for the blockchain
# 0x00 = Bitcoin
# 0x01 = Testnet3
# 0x02 = Byte1 is another coin"s magic code (gives 256 options)
# 0x03 = Byte1-2 is treated as the coin magic code (gives 65280 more options)
M = (magic & 0x03) << 4
# Next two bits are the byte length of the block reference
B = ((byte length of block reference) & 0x03) << 2
# Final two bits are the byte length of the transaction index
T = ((byte length of transaction index) & 0x03)
# Assemble into the first byte
Byte0 = V | M | B | T
This gives you up to 3 bytes for each block and transaction reference,
which is 16.7 M blocks, or year 2336, and 16.7 M transaction slots.
Data part: [Byte0][optional magic bytes 1-2][block reference bytes][tx
reference bytes]
So the shortest data part would have 3 bytes in it, with the reference
version 0 genesis coinbase transaction having data part 0x050000.
I know this is a departure from your vision, but it would be much more
flexible for the long term.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] A BIP proposal for conveniently referring to 
Hello List,
I would like to propose a BIP that specifies a way of referring to transactions that have been successfully inserted into the blockchain.
The format makes use of the excellent Bech32 encoding, and is designed to be short and useful for human use. A C reference implementation is included.
Special care has been taken so this BIP is naturally extendable to support future upgrades to Bitcoin, Bitcoin Sidechains, or even from other blockchain projects. However, only support for the Bitcoin Main Chain, and the Test Network is specified in this draft.
I hope that the participants of the bitcoin-development mailing list find this draft BIP both interesting and useful. You are welcomed to read the full text here: If assigned with a BIP number some small updates to the specification will be made in accommodation.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] [BIP Proposal] Nym Enrolment Transaction Template 
Hello list,
I would like to propose a draft BIP that takes the next available transaction version number and defines a new transaction template. This proposal does not have any consensus changes, and is purely for the application layer of Bitcoin. The new transaction template defines a special transaction structure that can be used as a cryptographic pseudonym.
I hope the community will find this proposal useful and will find time to give it careful review.
Here is the first BIP within our project
I would like to thank the entire team that has supported me in creating this proposal.
