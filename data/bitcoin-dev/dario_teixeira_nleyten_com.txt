@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] More precise type information in API reference 
Dear Bitcoin devs,
I am the author of OCaml-bitcoin [1], a library offering an OCaml to the official Bitcoin client API.  For those who may be unfamiliar with it,
OCaml is one of those functional programming languages with a very rich expressive type system [2].  Given its emphasis on safety, its users are disproportionally found in the aerospace and financial Now, OCaml programmers care a lot about types, because experience has
taught them that deep down most programming errors are just type errors.
 From this stems my request: please consider defining more precisely the information associated with each API call in the JSON-RPC reference [3].
To give you a better idea of what I'm talking about, please take a look the API offered by OCaml-bitcoin [4], and the associated type [5] (note that these have not been updated for Bitcoin Core 0.10 yet).
I've created the type definitions from information gathered from the wiki and from looking at the Bitcoin Core source-code.  I wouldn't be if it contains errors, because neither the source-code nor the wiki is precise about the actual types being used.  As an example, consider type
hexspk_t ("hex representation of script public key").  Is this really same type used in both signrawtransaction and createmultisig?
Improving this situation would pose a minimal burden on bitcoin devs: that would be required is defining the precise set of types used in the API, and annotating the RPC calls either in the source-code itself or in API reference documentation.  It would make writing bindings such as far easier and less error prone, and it would have the added advantage better documenting the Bitcoin Core source-code itself.
Also, note that it is not necessary to extend this request to the deep
data structures returned by some API calls.  Consider for instance the
gettransaction function of the OCaml-bitcoin API: it returns the raw object without any attempt to process it.  This is because that's a niche facility, and the bindings would balloon in size if I were to every single large return object.  Instead, the bindings take the more
pragmatic stance of only processing the parameters and return results a strong type discipline is imperative.
When I raised this issue on IRC a number of questions were posed.
What follows is my attempt to answer them:
   Q: What does it matter, if JSON only has a tiny set of types?
   A: JSON being the serialisation format is irrelevant.  The client       know that even if a public ECDSA key is serialised as a string, it       not stop being a public ECDSA key, and should only be used where a       ECDSA key is expected.
   Q: What does it matter if the types are not even distinguished in the       source of Bitcoin Core?
   A: That is unfortunate, because it opens the door to bugs caused by       errors.  Moreover, even if the C++ source is "stringly-typed" and       not enforce a strong type discipline, that does not mean that the       are not there.  Even if a public and private key are both       as strings, can you use one where the other is expected?  If not,       they actually have different types!
   Q: Isn't this a maintenance nightmare, given the changes to Bitcoin    A: Actually, the most burdensome part is what motivated this message:
      keeping track of the types used.  If the Bitcoin API reference were
      more precise, keeping the bindings up-to-date would be trivial and
      even mechanical, because the API is now fairly stable.
Thank you very much for your attention, and for all the work you guys into Bitcoin development.  It is much appreciated and not acknowledged
often enough!
Best regards,

Hi again,
My excuses: the formatting of the message seems to have been eaten
by a Gremlin.  Here's a second attempt:
Dear Bitcoin devs,
I am the author of OCaml-bitcoin [1], a library offering an OCaml
interface to the official Bitcoin client API.  For those who may
be unfamiliar with it, OCaml is one of those functional programming
languages with a very rich and expressive type system [2].  Given its
emphasis on safety, its industrial users are disproportionally
found in the aerospace and financial sectors.
Now, OCaml programmers care a lot about types, because experience
has taught them that deep down most programming errors are just
type errors.  From this stems my request: please consider defining
more precisely the type information associated with each API call
in the JSON-RPC reference [3].
To give you a better idea of what I'm talking about, please take a

definitions [5] (note that these have not been updated for Bitcoin
Core 0.10 yet).  I've created the type definitions from information
gathered from the Bitcoin wiki and from looking at the Bitcoin
Core source-code.  I wouldn't be surprised if it contains errors,
because neither the source-code nor the wiki is very precise about

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] More precise type information in API 
Hi Dave,
Thanks -- it is much appreciated!
Sure, I would be glad to help.  In fact, most of grunt work has
already been done for the OCaml-bitcoin API [1,2], which could be
used as a guide even if you don't use OCaml (beware that it may
contain errors, though).
Besides tweaking each RPC call, we would need to add a new section
to the docs, to be placed before the RPC calls.  This List of
Types section would list all the custom types defined in the API,
providing a brief description for each and indicating the JSON type
used for serialisation (almost invariantly "string", I reckon).
But before I submit a pull request, allow me to exemplify with
Parameter  (no changes)
Parameter  I would keep "array" as the type of "Keys or
Addresses".  If we follow the convention of using a pipe character to
represent unions, then the type for "Key or Address" is not "string",
but "public_key | p2pkh_address".  This would also require adding
two entries to the List of Types section, describing public_key and
p2pkh_address, and letting the users know that they are serialised
as JSON strings.  (Note that the precise type of "Keys or Addresses"
is actually "Array [public_key | p2pkh_address]".  However, since
the type of each element is also listed, this info is redundant
and we can safely state it's just an array.)
Parameter  The type should be "account", obviously.
Result: a p2sh_address.  If there is only one type of such P2SH
addresses and they can be used interchangeably, then this would
suffice.  If however, there are actually several incompatible kinds
of P2SH address, then we'd need to be more precise about which one
we mean.
Thanks again for your time!
Kind regards,
Dario Teixeira
