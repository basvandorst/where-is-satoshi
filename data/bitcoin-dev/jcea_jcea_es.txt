@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Downloading blockchain 
Hash: SHA1
I would like to download the entire blockchain by hand (kind of), but
I can't find software for it. The closest thing I found is
"Bitcoin-protocol-test-harness" code, but it is two years old and
seems not to work with current bitcoin network.
Python apreciated.
Thanks for your help.

"sendfrom" in the RPC interface. Difficult to use (I would like to be
able to use source key, in addition of source "accounts") and easy to
make mistakes. But doable.
Would be nice to have an "advanced" GUI option to chooce source

What options are out there for people caring about 20GB blockchain?
Depending of third party server is not an option.

AFAIK, current bitcoin code code already set blockchain checkpoints from
time to time. It is a garanteed that a longer chain starting before the
checkpoint is not going to be accepted suddently. See
Could be perfectly valid to store only unspend wallets before last
checkpoint, if during the blockchain download the node did all the checks.
Would be interesting, of course, to be able to verify "unspend wallet
accounting" having only that checkpoint data (the merkle tree can do
that, I guess). So you could detect a data corruption or manipulation in
your local harddisk.

Why?. The points in the forum thread seem pretty sensible.
