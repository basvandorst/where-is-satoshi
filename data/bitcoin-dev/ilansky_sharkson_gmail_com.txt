Reply to dead man's switch,
Since this topic as gone un-technical,
People can already place a timer on transactions with the script to send
funds if not moved for a given period,
And people are responsible adults, trying to take ahead of every possible
future human error from the protocol perspective looks more like french
socialism than bitcoinism

USD per coin, nobody will build mining infrastructure to the same level as
today, with 5000 USD per coin.
In the case of bitcoin, it is the price that follows mining
infrastructures. The price is at 5000 because it is difficult to mine
bitcoin not the other way around, like you mention it. Even with a fixed
demand, price would go up as difficulty grow, the supply guide the market.
There is a strong incentive to mine blindly as it is difficult to estimate
for a miner where is the actual demand, with a start up currency without
actual economic support. Indeed at the genesis of this "mining-price" cycle
the incentive was to contribute to a network and create ones own supply,
and not respond to a demand.

The only blocktime reduction that would be a game changer, would be a 1
second blocktime or less, and by less I mean much less maybe 1000
blocks/second. Which would enable decentralized high frequency trading or
playing WoW on blockchain and other cool stuff.
But technology is not developped enough as far as I now, maybe with quantum
computers in the future, and it is even bitcoins goal?
Also there is a guy who wrote a script to avoid "sybil attack" from 2x
I don't know what it's worth, maybe check it out, I'm not huge support of
that kind of methods.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Built in encryption 
Hey guys,
Features info,
I know we can add text to a btc transaction and it is pretty easy,
However is it possible to encrypt the data in a way that only the receiver
would be able to read it in clear.
And of course without having to exchange info off the network.
And if not possible on bitcoin would it be possible on a sidechain or on
rsk or else
I have few ideas of concrete uses of it, I'm sure you guys may also think
of something interesting,

How do you handle the mining on each chain ?
The chain with the most mining power will tend to have more value.
Also blocks are not mined equally and 1 chain will be longer than the other
thus faster thus more valuable.
It seems to be a sidechain proposal with the exact same protocol.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Merge of protocol 
2017 was fork year,
Is it technically possible to merge two protocoles ? And thus bringing the
strength of both into one resulting coin.
I would not be surprized to see a lot of altcoin wanting to merge with
bitcoin or between them, especially with LN current development, if it is
If anyone has ideas or ressources on this,
