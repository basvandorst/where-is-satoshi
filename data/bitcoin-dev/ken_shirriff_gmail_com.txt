@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Proposal to add the bitcoin symbol to Unicode 
Use of the bitcoin symbol in text is inconvenient, because the bitcoin
symbol isn't in the Unicode standard. To fix this, I've written a proposal
to have the common B-with-vertical-bars bitcoin symbol added to Unicode.
I've successfully proposed a new character for Unicode before, so I'm
familiar with the process and think this has a good chance of succeeding.
The proposal is at I received a suggestion to run this proposal by the bitcoin-dev group, so I
hope this email is appropriate here. Endorsement by Bitcoin developers will
help the Unicode Committee realize the importance of adding this symbol, so
please let me know if you support this proposal.

Actually that page argues that using the Thai Bhat currency symbol *for*
Bitcoin causes confusion. From the page you linked to:
The Thai Baht (? ) is sometimes
used to represent Bitcoin, but this certainly raises a problem of
differenciation between the Thai Baht and Bitcoin.
Their main motivation for using the horizontal-bar ? (which they admit is a
hack) is they consider adding a character to Unicode to be a "really long
and complicated process". My view is that adding the bitcoin sign to
Unicode avoids confusion with the Thai Baht, avoids hacks such as ?, and
lets everyone use the standard symbol. Hopefully it won't be a really long
and complicated process...
