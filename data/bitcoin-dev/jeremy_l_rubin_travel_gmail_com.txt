@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Defining a min spec 
Might I suggest that the min-spec, if developed, target the RISC-V Rocket
architecture (running on FPGA, I suppose) as a reference point for
performance? This may be much lower performance than desirable, however, it
means that we don't lock people into using large-vendor chipsets which have
unknown, or known to be bad, security properties such as Intel AMT.
In general, targeting open hardware seems to me to be more critical than
performance metrics for the long term health of Bitcoin, however,
performance is still important.
Does anyone know how the RISC-V FPGA performance stacks up to, say, a
Raspberry Pi?

I think you're missing what I'm saying -- the point of my suggestion to
make Rocket a min-spec is more along the lines of saying that the Rocket
serves as a fixed point, Bitcoin Core performance must be acceptable on
that platform, however it can be lower. Yes there are conversion factors
and different architectures will perform differently. However, there still
must be some baseline, a point at which we can say processors below it no
longer are supported. I am saying that line should never be set so high as
to exclude presently available open hardware.
Ultimately, this ends up making an odd, but nice, goal for Bitcoin
development. If Bitcoin Core needs more MIPS, the community must ensure the
availability of open hardware that it can run on.
Moxie looks fantastic! The reason I thought RISC-V was a good selection is
the very active development community which is pushing the performance of
the ISA implementations forward. Can you speak to the health of Moxie
development? Ultimately, ensuring support for many open architectures would
be preferable. Are there other reasonable open-source processors that you
are aware of?
I would be willing to work on a design a Bitcoin specific open-hardware
processor, up to the FPGA bound, if this would be useful for this goal.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] For discussion: limit transaction size to 
I think it's not a horrible idea to just add a field into the transaction
metadata for N_SIG_OPS in the script_sig
It is much simpler in implementation if the concern is complexity (once a
transaction goes above N_SIG_OPS it could be considered invalid, number
computed must be equal). It wouldn't even need to be stored permanently as
it can be pruned easily and recomputed later (hashes would protect against
buggy complicated sig counting code).
Furthermore, it would differentiate a branch with different counts well.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP: Short Term Use Addresses for Scalability 
While we're all debating the block size, please review this proposal to
modestly increase the number of transactions per block.

I think the catch here is that under STUA (short term use address) there is
a strict incentive, you can reduce the transaction fee for these txns. This
also fits with the general model that you pay the miners for security. My
belief is that when there is a savings benefit to be had large players will
prefer it at a minimum, and users will desire it.
Your analysis of saving is inaccurate, it comes to be at or greater than 20
bytes because there is typically 2 UTXOs or more. I get that this is still
marginal, but when the margins are tight this is a pretty decent gain.
The security decrease is actually less extreme than it seems. This is for
multiple reasons:
1) you can select LEN_PARAM when you make the tx to be secure at that time
Adding a byte or two gets much more security while still keeping it lean.
2) For a small transaction, the hash power is less rewarding than just
working on the blockchain or doing something else
3) These addresses are only for use for short term, not perm storage. As
such, if you model the threat it isn't great (I'm using this address for
one day, someone grinds it in that time).
4) Because it is a UTXO saving, it reduces memory bloat.t
It would be interesting to get a more exact analysis on the time needed to
run a brute force as it involves computing a valid keypair and hashing for
each attempt.

A standard transaction is 225 bytes, leading to a savings of 8.6%.
However, that is essentially the minimum saving. For other sizes (eg, 10
outputs) which seem to be pretty frequent savings can be greater.
Furthermore, it is important to note that this is a memory saving for the
UTXO pool so the reduction there is more (not super familiar with how the
UTXO pool is stored, but it should be a better savings than 8.6%).
Does anyone have the tools currently to be able to easily run through the
chain and analyze the impact of this change on historical data more

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP Draft: Minimum Viable TXIn Hash 
Please see the following draft BIP which should decrease the amount of
bytes needed per transaction. This is very much a draft BIP, as the design
space for this type of improvement is large.
This BIP can be rolled out by a soft fork.
Improvements are around 12% for  standard "one in two out" txn, and even
more with more inputs hashes.
