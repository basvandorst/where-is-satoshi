@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] extension-blocks/sidechains & 
Micha I think you are correct, I dont think extension blocks (or
sidechains for that matter) can allow soft-fork increase of the total
Bitcoins in the system, because the main chain still enforces the 21m
coin cap.  A given extension block could go fractional, but if there
was a run to get out, the last users out will lose, or they'll all
take a hair-cut etc.  So presumably users would decline to use an
extension block with fractional bitcoin.
I mean you could view it like say an exchange (mtgox?) that somehow
accidentally or intentionally creates fictional Bitcoin IOUs in it's
system, eg in some kind of pyramid scheme - that doesnt create more
Bitcoins, it just means people who think they have IOUs for real
Bitcoins, are fractional or fake.  With an extension block or
sidechain furthermore it is transparent so they will know they are
Relatedly it seems possible to implement a sidechain with advertised
demurrage, with an exit or entrance fee to discourage holding outside
of the chain to avoid demurrage.  There are apparently economic
arguments for why people might opt in to that (higher velocity
economic activity, gresham's law, merchants offering discounts for
buying with demurrage Bitcoins, maybe lower per transaction fees
because say miners can mine the demurrage).  However that is a
different topic, again not changing the number of coins in

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] hard-fork "X+Y" compromise discussion re-run 
I agree with everything Matt said.  This "X+Y" "compromise" is not a
new proposal and has been hashed over multiple times in the past
dating back to at least fall 2015, ignores basically all design
considerations and research over the last  years, doesn't understand
the real-politic of the delays, and so doesn't even help in the
political domain.
I have taken the liberty of making a reddit thread with some of the
previous explainers about why this doesn't work in practice (even
ignoring all politics and hypothetically assuming it was a great
all-new idea), let the discussion commence!
UASF is a more logical step, than these "X+Y" politically motivated
hard-forks, though UASF has risks vs SegWit BIPs in flight, the delay
and risk is far lower than political hard-forks.
I have set the reply-to to bitcoin-discuss.

Separate from scale, there is utility to a hard-fork to fix wish-list
bugs that cant be reasonably fixed via soft-fork.  The spoonnet
proposal fixes a good number of interesting bugs.  Spoonnet and
several other HF research proposals can be found here
  Part of the research on HF
is about safe deployment methods which is obviously the other main
consideration.  It seems to me likely that if the HF were to focus on
bug fixes, and not mix in new tradeoffs of security vs scale, it would
more easily reach consensus.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP: OP_BRIBVERIFY - the op code needed for Blind 
On 27 June 2017 at 22:20, Luke Dashjr via bitcoin-dev
Maybe that's phrased badly but the point of the "blind merge mining"
is just that the sidechain fees are paid in main chain bitcoin (rather
than in sidechain bitcoin).
That means that a miner who solo mines the main chain could still mine
the sidechain by requesting a block-proposal from a trusted sidechain
fullnode.  The sidechain fullnode would actually pay the mainchain
fee, and pay itself the sidechain fees as part of the side-chain
This was viewed as less centralising than forcing miners to directly
process sidechain blocks, which could in principle be bandwidth and
CPU expensive to process, construct and validate.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] hypothetical: Could soft-forks be prevented? 
True however in principle a soft-fork can also be soft-forked out. Eg say a
publicly known soft-fork done by miners only that user node software did
not upgrade for first by opt-in adoption. If there was consensus against by
users and ecosystem a node/user flag day soft fork could block it's
effects. Or if a soft fork was determined to have a major bug.
However most types of soft fork are opt-in and so mostly that situation
seems unlikely.  A censorship soft-fork is harder, that's a standard
hard-fork to bypass with current fungibility mechanisms.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Simple lock/unlock mechanism 
============================== START ==============================
Coincidentally I had thought of something similar to what Kalle posted
about a kind of software only time-lock vault, and described the idea
to a few people off-list.  Re. Root incompatibility, if the key is
deleted (as it must be) then a delegated signature can not be made
that bypasses the CSV timeout restriction, so Root should not be
incompatible with this.  I think it would be disadvantageous to mark
keys as Rootable vs not in a sighash sense, because then that is
another privacy/fungibility loss eroding  the uniformity advantage of
Root when the delegate is not used.
One drawback is deleting keys may itself be a bit difficult to assure
with HD wallet seeds setup-time backup model.
As Anthony described I think, a simpler though less robust model would
be to have a third party refuse to co-sign until a pre-arranged time,
and this would have the advantage of not requiring two on-chain
With bulletproofs and CT rangeproofs / general ECDL ZKPS there is the
possibility to prove things about the private key, or hidden
attributes of a public key in zero-knowledge.  Kind of what we want is
to place private key covenants, where we have to prove that they are
met without disclosing them.  For example there is a hidden CSV and it
is met OR there is no hidden CSV so it is not applicable.

the musig construction
Yes, but you can't do that without a delinearization mechanism to prevent
adaptive public key choice being used to break the scheme using Wagner's
attack. It is not specific to addition, it is a generalized birthday attack.
Look at the delinearization mechanism for an intuition, all public keys are
hashed along with per value hash, so that pre-commits and forces the public
keys to be non-adaptively chosen.
Adaptively chosen public keys are dangerous and simple to exploit for
example pub keys A+B, add party C' he chooses C=C'-A-B, now we can sign for
A+B+C using adaptively chose public key C.
Btw Wagner also breaks this earlier delinearization scheme

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Deterministic Entropy From BIP32 Keychains 
I looked at it and consider the crypto choices reasonable and reusing
existing bitcoin dependencies in library crypto building blocks
For myself i think the use-case of having an offline seed manager that
can be backed up once, and support multiple wallets, including ones
created after the backup improves a practical and under-addressed
problem for many users and businesses.
The fact that the interface between an offline seed manager and a
hardware or software wallet can be a bip39 mnemonic seed is convenient
and an improvement over using custom derivation paths for practical
use given the complexity of custom paths and variable support for them
in wallets.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] RFC: Deterministic Entropy From BIP32 Keychains 
I think the point is to use this proposed extension/standard for a
kind of "seed management" function, set it up on an offline device (an
always offline laptop, or a modified hardware wallet) where you put
the master seed.  And then you use this as a kind of seed manager and
transcript the seeds for different sub-wallets into the respective
wallets as BIP39 mnemonics.
So I do not think it needs any changes from existing wallet authors,
as the interaction point is a bip 39 seed, which they mostly know how
to use.  Indeed if you were to modify an existing wallet to accept the
master seed from seed management scheme and derive the seed it needs
on each wallet, then that would create a weakest link in the chain
risk - if that wallet was insecure, or compromised then all other
derived seeds would be also and you want independence for each wallet.
I do think that this use case is a practical problem for people
managing multiple seeds for various wallets in a bitcoin business
setting or even power users - you lose the single backup design,
because it's too cumbersome to create fresh backups for each of
multiple wallets, especially distributed , fireproof cryptosteel etc
backups and so in practice for multi wallet scenarios probably they
are not all full backed up or not backed up as robustly (not as
geo-redundant, fireproof, secret-shared etc).

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Is BIP32's chain code needed? 
Another advantage of random access from BIP 32 vs iterated chain is
that if there is a bit-flip or corruption, you don't destroy access to
all future addresses, but only burn one utxo.  Empirically not an
entirely theoretical issue.
I think the only thing i'd care about is bloating up the number of
characters to backup, if the codes are all derived it doesn't matter
too much.  I tend to think of 128-bits as enough given that is the
security target of ECDSA, so long as reasonable key-stretching
algorithms are used that don't interact badly with the key use, which
seems a very reasonable assumption for PBKF2 and ECDSA.
Agree the iterated hashing argument does not seem a practical concern
- eg BIP 39 uses PBKDF2 uses 2048 iterated hash invocations.  I
suppose it's strictly true that as the hash is deterministic and not a
bijection (not a permutation), there are collisions and if you iterate
enough unreachable states can be eliminated.  But because the domain
is so large as to be practically unenumerable it won't creates a brute
force short-cut
