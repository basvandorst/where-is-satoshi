@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] v0.16.1 test_bitcoin fails on Deian 9 
I observed strange result when running src/test/test_bitcoin on Debian 9.
I tested with the following platforms:
1) OS X High Sierra 10.13.6 with
   ./configiure --enable-debug
2) Debian 9 (with latest packages) with    ./configure --enable-debug --disable-wallet --without-gui
3) Ubuntu 16.04 with:
   ./configure --with-debug --disable-wallet
strangely,  configuration 2 cause core dump but others not:
Running 264 test cases...
unknown location(0): fatal error: in "validation_block_tests/processnewblock_signals_ordering": memory access violation at address: 0x00000000: no mapping at fault address
zsh: segmentation fault  ./test_bitcoin
I guess it is due to toolchain differences.
Any thoughts?
