Let's agree that one factor in mining profitability is bandwidth/network
reliability/stability. Why focus on that vs electricity contracts or
vertically integrated chip manufacturers? Surely, sufficient network
bandwidth is a more broadly available commodity than <$0.02/kwh
electricity, for example. I'm not sure that your stranded hydroelectric
miner is any more desirable than thousands of dorm room miners with access
to 10gbit university connections and free electricity.

One thing that the below assumption doesn't appear to take into account is
user demand for quick confirmations. I haven't fully thought out the game
theory on this but here goes:
Example: if 75% of hashing power accepts 'medium' fee transactions while
25% is willing to accept low (or any) fee transactions, then a user paying
a lower fee wishing to get their transaction included in the next block
runs a ~75% chance that their transaction won't be included.
Users desiring the most reliably fast confirmations are better off by
paying the minimum fee that a majority of miners will accept. Miners
breaking ranks and accepting lower fees only affects users who aren't
sufficiently interested in quicker confirmations. As long as a majority of
miners 'collude', they will likely be able to keep the average fees higher
than miners with the lower costs of operations might be willing to accept.

1. Data centers are not some uniform group of businesses with identical
   policies nor firms with identical laws applied. The ability to get a search
   warrant at a Swedish hosting provider will be dramatically different than a
   Singaporean business. Similar to the decentralized nature of bitcoin, these
   businesses are independent and varied - it would be difficult for
   authorities to conduct a widescale attack on nodes worldwide, especially
   given current laws. It would also be ineffective since any hacked/seized
   host can be replaced quickly with a competitor service in a different
   jurisdiction.
   2. Personal residences and non-data center businesses are not immune to
   theft, blackmail, seizure, hacking, etc. Depending upon the adversary and
   method of attack, many users would be no worse off with their nodes not
   located on premise. As alluded to above, it's a lot easier and less costly
   to spin up a new 3rd party host than it is to replace a stolen laptop.
There is nothing inherently wrong with data centers/hosting providers
playing a significant (but not central) role in decentralized services.
Users who choose to use a VPS are not contributing to bitcoin in some sort
of inferior capacity. I'll posit that 3rd party providers are not an ideal
place to hold private keys, but that is off topic.

I like elegant solutions and while eventually I can see a "pay to
contribute" service, I don't imagine you'll get consensus in short order.
List provider costs are pretty reasonable, so if that's the hurdle to
overcome I'm happy to offer sponsorship.

"My opinion is the most sustainable solution would be to identify a
team of admins and use something like Digital Ocean's new team accounts
feature and have someone like SolidX contribute funds for the servers
and a few hours a week from one of their sysadmins to the team."
This is a perfectly fine option. Alternatively, if the paid mailing list
option is preferred, I'd suggest Intermedia:

Yep - similarly: you live in a neighborhood with a local coffee store. Sure
you could use a stolen credit card or a fake $5 bill, but it's not worth
the risk of being caught for a $3 coffee. And on the other side, the store
can deal with 1% of transactions getting reversed or having a fake bill so
they don't change their procedures.
Perfection is not necessary in all situations.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Draft BIP : fixed-schedule block size increase 
There are a number of factors that contribute to mining vulnerabilities.
For example, presuming a miner is a meaningful contributor to the network,
they'll be using more electricity than their neighbors and will be easily
identifiable in the same way illegal grow-houses are identified by the
local power company working with authorities. A hacked or seized hosted
server is far easier to recover from than seized equipment. Its hard to see
how requiring a reasonably reliable internet connection is a particularly
high barrier to entry when compared to the other mining requirements, such
as funds to purchase ASICs, competitive electricity costs, reasonable
belief that equipment won't be stolen or seized, the technical knowledge
for setting up a p2pool node, etc.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] The need for larger blocks 
While an interesting philosophical question, I don't think that this is
accurate. First off, bitcoin doesn't imbue  any 'rights' on individuals -
it provides the choice of participating or not, nothing more.
Secondly, from a technical perspective, how is it that the majority (or
super-majority) are prevented from imposing their will? The best answer is
that they are incentivized to not override a minority group since that
reduces the inherent value in the system. However, presuming that the
majority calculate that the reward for imposing a change is greater than
the value lost in such disruption, I don't see how there would be any
stopping this change. The longest chain with the greatest number of users
valuing the token on that chain "wins".

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] The need for larger blocks 
Agreed on both accounts. The main point is that there are no inherent
rights built into bitcoin - just aligned economic interests enforced by
agreed upon technical rules. The technical rules allow for a majority to
dictate, while the economic interests may or may not support such a change.

@_author: Ivan Brightly 
@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] The need for larger blocks 
I don't think that rights are a pillar of how bitcoin works - rather I
would say it's a matter of aligned incentives. The fact is that the
majority technically *can* dictate through PoW and acceptance. The only
reason that the majority would not chose this path is because there is
greater economic value in consensus, whether perceived or realized.
If bitcoin were about "doing the right thing" there wouldn't be a need for
PoW since no individual would be incentivized to double spend.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Dynamic limit to the block size - BIP draft 
This is true, but miners already control block size through soft caps.
Miners are fully capable of producing smaller blocks regardless of the max
block limit, with or without collusion. Arguably, there is no need to ever
reduce the max block size unless technology advances for some reason
reverse course - aka, WW3 takes a toll on the internet and the average
bandwidth available halves. The likelihood of significant technology
contraction in the near future seems rather unlikely and is more broadly
problematic for society than bitcoin specifically.
The only reason for reducing the max block limit other than technology
availability is if you think that this is what will produce the fee market,
which is back to an economic discussion - not a technology scaling

Agreed. For this reason, the scaling BIPs which don't allow for easy gaming
such as BIP101, your proposal or Pieter's are preferable for their
predictability and simplicity. Changing the fundamental rules for Bitcoin
is supposed to be hard - why give this power up to a subsection of the
ecosystem in order to make it easier to change or game?
