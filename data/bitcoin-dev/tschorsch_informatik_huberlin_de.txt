@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Bitcoin Survey Paper 
Hi all,
some time ago, we became interested in Bitcoin, but gathering relevant
work and getting an overview was kind of painful. We took it as a sign
that a survey paper on Bitcoin is desperately needed.
Since then we observed the activities of the Bitcoin community. Recently
we finished a technical report that is our attempt to contribute the
lacking Bitcoin survey. Maybe it will be of interest to some of you:
Feedback is highly appreciated and would help to improve the quality of
future revisions.
Cheers, Florian.
