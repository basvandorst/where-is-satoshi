I would like to know what are your thoughts on moving bitcoin.org on a
dedicated server with a SSL certificate?
I am considering the idea more seriously, but I'd like some feedback
before taking steps.

Forward secrecy:
I was definitively already interested in using this.
Sourceforge is not encrypted, actually. Although binaries hosting /
sharing could be a separate subject discussed later I think.
I guess we could just buy another SSL cert from another CA (I mean, if
that really happens). There's a few ones that are not US based.
So long as we actually use DNS, the website is centralized :( However,
its content isn't (can be forked on GitHub), but regarding the domain
name, there is not much we can do against this AFAIK.

Actually I might find way to fund it. But I needed to have ACK &
comments from developers before anything.
That is a fair question, we will need anti-DDoS. Unless something better
(and affordable) can be recommended, this would yet put another Bitcoin
website under CloudFlare.
Obviously, I thought it would be important that the server is owned by
someone who can be trusted, with ssh access for all core developers.
I'm not sure we'll get any change on this level. I have no idea if the
domain is in good hands, except for the fact that nothing bad happened
thus far. If anything, moving it to core developers (as intended when
the domain was registered) would make more sense IMO. But again, is it
possible, I don't know.

I fully agree that someone *must* be assigned to the task, otherwise
it's better keeping current hosting.
Perhaps that was implicit, but I can take this responsibility so long as
I can be replaced if required for any reason. On this regard, I agree
that the Foundation funding / owning / securing the server
infrastructure is a much better long term strategy.
This said, I also agree that it is a better idea to keep the domain and
website content independently owned and managed, for the reasons stated
by Gregory Maxwell.
If there isn't a good consensus on one of the two options I suggested, I
vote we don't lose more time on this question and keep focus with bigger

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Handling alerts & communication on bitcoin.org 
There is currently 5 alerts pages on bitcoin.org concerning past network
events (vulnerabilities, hard fork, etc.). Those don't have any
visibility and cannot be listed or followed easily.
I've created a setup to improve this and allow developers to easily
communicate about any kind of network event worth mentionning. Code,
screenshot, live demo, instructions and details are in the pull request :
Any comment is welcome. And since it is ultimately a tool for
developers, only you can define if it makes sense to merge it. Or if you
would like it to be done differently.
