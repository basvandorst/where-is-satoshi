I advocate a policy like this, except I propose two modifications:
- Point 4 should include *zero or more* altcoin developers, such that those
altcoins also deploy mitigations as early as Bitcoin. (Call this "early
altcoin disclosure".)
- Disclose of vulnerabilities, by social convention, always explicitly
names which altcoin developers were included in my proposed Early Altcoin
Disclosure and Point 6.
The rationale is that the policy should allow closer coordination with
altcoins. If the goal is minimizing economic damage, including altcoins
earlier may be the better trade-off between inclusiveness and secrecy. At
the same time, the policy doesn't establish *which* altcoins, which is a
tricky choice. However it *does* require disclosure of those relationships,
which provides a form of feedback on the system.
Imagine if altcoin X is compromised, and later disclosure occurs that
reveals that altcoin X was not contacted early, then this *might* indicate
leaks, maliciousness in the Bitcoin mitigation organization, or it *might*
be coincidence or dumb luck. In the other case, if the Bitcoin disclosure
reveals that X was indeed contacted early, then it probably indicates
incompetence of the altoin X.
Finally, notice that this kind of loose early disclosure policy can be
symmetric. For example, Zcash developers may choose to disclose
vulnerabilities they discover which affect Bitcoin to Bitcoin developers
*before* Zcash releases fixes, or before those fixes are widely adopted in
Zcash. We actually have a policy of doing this, since it's obvious that if
our mitigation process leaks and that's used to attack Bitcoin the
potential economic damage is very large.
I advocate for something like the latter case. I'd like to see a timeout on
disclosure. There's an endless tail of alt-coins that could be affected,
and no guarantee all will vigilantly upgrade. Meanwhile, deciding which of
them to disclose to confidentially versus which should just receive hints
to apply new patches is tricky and political.
Having a global timeout is a reasonable stop-gap. I consider the cost of
never disclosing, publicly, a known vulnerbility to be very high, even if
the fix is ubiquitously deployed, because it's a loss of security
knowledge, a precious public good.
Publishing a policy *might* increase organizational vulnerability, but so
might *not publishing* a policy. It seems fairly neutral to me on
vulnerability impact, whereas the benefit is good for users and developers.
Publishing after a reasonable timeout has many benefits. Many security
researchers learn from vulnerability disclosures across many disciplines
and industries. Future protocol designers of things potentially unrelated
to blockchain altogether may also learn important lessons.
If the first of those arguments holds, well, hopefully this message has

Happy to see Mark Friedenbach's strawman implementation. Two clarifying
This implementation would allow old-style implicit fees which would have
the same behavior (Pay-Your-Bid). Correct?
In terms of space costs, rebateable fee txns (or CPFP chains, I'm less
clear on that complication) add one UTXO 'internally' and new consensus
rules require one UTXO in the coinbase for the rebate, correct?
As for the paper itself: it doesn't account for high-latency/low-fee usage,
correct? What if I want a transaction to complete anytime in the next N
days for as cheap as given some probability of success?
This has two parts: a. Is there a clear/clean game-theoretic-compatible UX
for users? b. would the implementation be simple enough? If either a is
'no' or b is 'complicated', then the trade-off might not be much better
than the status quo.
Maybe for a high enough latency, the answer to a is 'yes' and b. is
'simple' by this strawman: try a tiny fee, if that doesn't work, try a new
higher fee and repeat. Is that good enough?

Wouldn't this RBF loop behave pretty much the same in the Monopolistic
Price Mechanism? (I haven't grokked RSOP yet.)
In fact, so long as RBF works, isn't it possible to raise Pay-Your-Bid fees
and Monopolistic Price fees over time to express the time curve preference?
