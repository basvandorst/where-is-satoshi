Hello all!
For some time I was working on bitcoin daemon implementation in erlang. Now it's in the early stage of development. I'm trying to implement protocol not looking into bitcoind source, but using specification from  (found one bug so far), original paper and looking at the protocol messages which I get from peers.
My goal is to make scalable bitcoin daemon, capable of serving many thousands of peers on relatively low-end servers.
At current state it's capable of connecting and parsing messages from 3000+ peers on 256M RAM VPS without swap. It does not do much besides protocol parsing and peer discovery now, but it's only several days old. Chances are that it connected to your machine - check for /ebtcd:0.0.1/ user-agent in logs.
Short term pans: accept incoming connections, announce own address via addr message.
Mid term plans: add validation and routing (test on testnet), release source under open license (AGPL sounds good).
Long term: full-featured daemon.
P.S. In case someone wants to encourage me with some BTC, I set up donation adress:

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] A bitcoin UDP P2P protocol extension 
Not looked at code yet, some thoughts:
1) In IPv4 max UDP data size is 65507 bytes.
2) What about big messages (block)?
3) I think relay speed can be increased only by reducing network diameter. Introducing super-nodes with thousands of connected peers can greatly help here.
4) The only (IMO) UDP advantage: hole punching. But requirement of active TCP connection defies it. And hole punching will need protocol extension.
5) unsolicited tx broadcast will increase traffic of nodes (especially well-connected)
and less people will run them.

Here is a rough draft implementation of a UDP P2P protocol extension
for bitcoin:
? ? ? ?  Protocol specification (such that it is):
- UDP, bound to same port as TCP P2P (normally 8333)
- Active, simultaneous TCP P2P connection required (useful against DoS
and other attacks)
- Same message format as TCP P2P, same pchMessageStart conventions,
etc. (my CNetMessage pull req would be helpful here)
- Multiple P2P messages per UDP packet permitted
- Max UDP packet size 100*1024 bytes
- Advertises NODE_UDP in nServices
- New "getudpcook" TCP P2P command returns a "udpcook" message,
containing a yummy cookie
- UDP P2P commands "inv", "tx" and "addr" are handled as if received via TCP
- UDP P2P command "udpsub" sets a mask, that subscribes to one or more
data broadcasts.
- When USM_INV_BCAST mask bit is set, receive "inv" messages via UDP
rather than TCP.
Project and design goals (or, why do this?):
- It is theorized that UDP may be useful for some messages we
broadcast throughout the network
- A productive discussion STARTS with code, otherwise discussion
continues forever.
- Investigate improving "inv" relay speed
- Investigate unconditional "tx" broadcasting via UDP, as "inv"
alternative, for small tx's.
- Investigate improving block relay speed (or perhaps block header relay speed)
- Open up new design avenues, for P2P patterns more suited to UDP than
TCP in general.
