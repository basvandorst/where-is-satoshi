Alternatively scenario: it will cause a sudden increase of Bitcoin mines
in countries where the algorithm is not patented, possibly causing a
geographical decentralization of miners from countries that already have
a lot of miners like China (if it is patented in China).

It will prevent companies from legally selling mining rigs with the
improvement, which stems access to the improvement in patented
countries. Or miners can export rigs with the improvement from companies
that sell it in non-patented countries.
It is not purely a software thing - it is intended to be used by
modifying hardware. From the paper: "The performance gain is achieved
through a high-?level optimization of the Bitcoin mining algorithm which
allows for drastic reduction in gate count on the mining chip. AsicBoost
is applicable to all types of mining hardware and chip designs."
Ultimately though, I think you're right in that Bitcoin's mining and
decentralized design combined with an international economy makes
patenting mining algorithms effectively pointless.

has potentially-majority support, or at most three months.
This wording is awkward. What is "potentially-majority"?
particularly including those selling desirable goods and services in
exchange for bitcoin payments, as well as Bitcoin holders who wish to
spend or would spend their bitcoins (including selling for other
currencies) differently in the event of such a hard-fork.
What if one shop owner, for example, out of thousands, doesn't adapt the
hard-fork? It is expected, and should perhaps be encouraged, for a small
minority to not accept a hard fork, but by the wording of the BIP
("entire Bitcoin economy"), one shop owner can veto a hard-fork.

It would be nice to decouple the venue, but even BIP 1 gives that
control to whoever controls the mailing list: "Following a discussion,
the proposal should be sent to the bitcoin-dev list and the BIP editor
with the draft BIP." (BIP 1)
A neater way to do it might be to replace references to the mailing list
with "public discussion medium" where "medium" can be defined as
something like any discussion forum frequented by the wider development
community, like the pull requests section of the BIP repo, conferences, etc.

"potentially has majority support"?
I think in general this sounds like a good definition for a hard-fork
becoming active. But I can envision a situation where someone will try
to be annoying about it and point to one instance of one buyer and one
seller using the blockchain to buy and sell from each other, or set one up.

It's extremely naive to think that just because you can't think of an
incentive for a reason for an attack to do this, an attacker will never
to do this. There are many people that would be willing to spend some
time to cause some trouble for the enjoyment of it, if the attack is
free to execute.
The fact that it takes very little time and effort to prevent a BIP from
reaching final status, means that in an base of millions of users it's
guaranteed that some disgruntled or bored person out there will attack
it, even if it's for the lulz.
To reasonably expect that any hark fork - including an uncontroversial
one - will be adapted by every single person in a ecosystem of millions
of people, is wishful thinking and the BIP may as well say "hard fork
BIPs shall never reach final status."

By the way, on that basis it might be a good idea to introduce an extra
status called "deployed" to indicate when a hard fork has reached a
super-majority and is being used by the economy in practice, but not the
whole economy.

The original disclosure didn't contain any information about the library
in question, so I did some digging.
I think that the vulnerability disclosure is referring to a pre-2013
version of jsbn, a JavaScript crypto library. Before it used the CSRNG
in the Web Crypto API, it tried to use nsIDOMCrypto, but incorrectly did
a string comparison when checking the browser version.
In practice though, this doesn't really matter, because
navigator.appVersion < "5" returns true anyway for old browsers. The
real issue is that modern browsers don't have window.crypto.random
defined, so Bitcoin wallets using a pre-2013 version of jsbn may not be
using a CSPRNG, when run on a modern browser.
As is noted though, even if a CSPRNG is used, the library passes the
output of the CSPRNG through RC4, which generates some biased bits,
leading to possible private key recovery.
