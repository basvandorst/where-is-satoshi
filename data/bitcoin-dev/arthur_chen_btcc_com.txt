I strongly agree!
In crypto we should always follow well-studied open standard rather than
custom construction.

Based on previous crypto analysis result, the actual security of SHA512 is
not significantly higher than SHA256.
maybe we should consider SHA3?

HMAC has proven security property.
It is still secure even when underlying crypto hashing function has
collision resistant weakness.
For example, MD5 is considered completely insecure now, but HMAC-MD5 is
still considered secure.
When in doubt, we should always use HMAC for MAC(Message Authentication
Code) rather than custom construction
