@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Sorting outputs of a transaction in alphabetic order 
Hi list. I've been a lurker for quite sometime and this is my first post.
The problem I'm addressing is that generally wallet devs construct the tx with the 2nd output being of the sender as change. This helps chain analysers to identity addresses and invade the users privacy.
I'm suggesting to sort the outputs in alphabetic order (or by pure random order) before broadcasting. This way the chain analyser cannot be sure which output is the change output and will improve privacy a little.
