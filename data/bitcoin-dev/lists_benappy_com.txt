@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Total fees have almost crossed the block reward 
This is the first time I post on this list.
First of all, Thank you Jameson for the interview you gave yesterday, it?s been a model of calm and self-control for all of us.
I deeply believe the high average fees we experience right now are mostly due to the miscalculations of most of the hardware (ledger & trezor) wallets (and probably software too) on the market.
I personally made transactions at the worst period for the Blockchain with less than 40 sat/WU of fees and got confirmed in less than a day.
I think there?s a lot of work to do in used education to make them understand that for a low amount of fees they can still get a transaction confirmed and that?s the POS? work to make sure the transaction is legit.
Regards, Michel.
