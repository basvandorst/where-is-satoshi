What came to my mind today, is, implementing a blockchain as a tracker. Nothing to do with Bitcoin as such, but with the blockchain I thought about making the blockchain contain all the magnet links and developing it independently. But that's another story and I think it has no place in this mailing list.
Also, you do realize that the majority of The Pirate Bay's content is illegal and shouldn't be discussed here.
You talk about open source, and yet you insist on people doing spam transactions in order to access certain content? That's a no-no.
