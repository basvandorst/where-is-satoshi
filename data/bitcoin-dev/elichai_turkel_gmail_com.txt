@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Taproot proposal 
I want to add to John Newbery's suggestion of using implicit even/odd only
public keys and tweaked public keys in taproot and suggest the following:
If everything is implicit then the only reason for the first byte of the
control block(`c[0]`) is the tapscript leaf version.
I suggest that this is moved to be the first OP_CODE of the tapscript
itself (i.e. OP_0/OP_1 etc.)
That way having the script *tells* you what does it mean without needing to
check the control block.
That way there's a separation between the tapscript+leaf version and the
control block being the merkle path to the script.

Hi everyone,
About the nonce being 64bit. (rfc7539 changed it to 96bit, which djb later
calls xchacha)
You suggest that we use the "message sequence number" as the nonce for
Chacha20, Is this number randomly generate or is this a counter?
And could it be reseted without rekeying?
If it is randomly generated then 64bit isn't secure enough. And we should
either move to the chacha20 from RFC7539 which has 96bit nonce and 32bit
counter or increment it manually every time.
If it's simply a counter then 64bit nonce should be fine :)

I just couldn't find where is the message sequence number comes from.
So if it's max 1GB and it's an incremental counter that cannot be reseted
without a rekeying than it's perfectly fine :).
Thanks for the answer!
