Apologies for a noob question.
But if I understand correctly, lightning nodes need to check if a
counterparty is broadcasting an old channel state and in response broadcast
a penalty/justice transaction. Does that mean lightning nodes only need to
watch for transactions that come after the funding transaction? Is that the
only reason lightning needs to run bitcoind with txindex?
If that is the case, and a lightning node only needs to query transactions
broadcast after the funding transaction, then a pruned bitcoind instance
with txindex might be a bit handy.
Also from [1] it seems that indexing pruned nodes is not supported because
it doesn't make sense, not that it was infeasible. Now with the lightning
requirements, does an indexed pruned node start to make sense?
Once again, please forgive my naive understanding of some of the issues
involved and thanks for your patience.

Hi Nicolas,
I have a small question about FastSync.
Would it make sense to validate all blocks once FastSync is complete
and BTCPayServer has started accepting payments?
I am aware this will require changes to bitcoind. So this is just an
academic question to figure if there are problems with such an
approach, especially for merchants accepting payments who want to get
started immediately and still want to stay on a Raspberry PI.
Phase 1: FastSync from trusted UTXO set and start accepting payments.
Phase 2: Validate the entire blockchain - this will take X days on
Raspberry PI - but at least in in the end you can fully trust your own
node. In this phase, you'd do IBD, but instead of writing to db, just
verify that the validated block matches the on the the db and move on.
It is a pity leveldb doesn't allow multiple processes to open the db.
If so, phase 2 could have been a different process altogether as well.
