Are there any PGP key servers that support EC key pairs?  OpenPGP Spec
RFC2440 defines key types for EC, just not sure if they were ever
implemented on the keyserver side.  Could even have a similar 'web of
trust' using private keys to sign people's identities similar to PGP.

no more than other messages such as transactions.
kind of defeats the purpose of the alert if it takes a long time to issue
I think leave the alert in, but relay alert messages even if they don't use
the correct key.  This means that if we later decide to add new keys to the
alert root trust then older clients will still relay these.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Roadmap to getting users onto SPV clients 
...or should we be directing people to a (vetted) list of cloud services -
I think this has a significantly lower entry cost than any client. I know
the mybitcoin debacle has clouded (pun intended) people's views of these
providers, but blockchain.info (for example) really does seem quite well
engineered, and satisfies many of the features in particular a very low
cost of entry, cross platform support and what appears to be very good
security (e.g. two factor)

The threat of a SHA1 collision attack to insert a malicious pull request
are tiny compared with the other threats - e.g. github being compromised,
one of the core developers' passwords being compromised, one of the core
developers going rogue, sourceforge (distribution site) being compromised
etc etc... believe me there's a lot more to worry about than a SHA1
Not meaning to scare, just to put things in perspective - this is why we
all need to peer review each others commits and keep an eye out for
suspicious commits, leverage the benefits of this project being open source
and easily peer reviewed.

Omaha - which is the automatic update framework that Google Chrome uses -
is open sourced:
It might be a bit heavyweight for just one package though.
