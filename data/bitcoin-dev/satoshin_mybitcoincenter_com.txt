Hi Everyone,
     First portion of your First BIP is excellent- with this field the protocol can actually attain HFT- by  pinning of value at time of trade for later unblock scaling as a mark to market tool which is used in HFT.
The Second BIP of a minimum price would never allow Bitcoin to pass the SEC test of a viable asset. - I hope that portion was actually a Joke since it makes no sense economically. If one has ever seen a stock drop 90% in one day then you would understand the volatile nature of future valuation.
Prices have to be able to go higher and lower based on market demand and not tethering to perceived norms. If the US dollar was crashed and it went down to Venezuelan currency levels [hypothetically then where would your 50k limit lead the currency} Never say never- Best Regards

This could could be a viable option. I think this is the right approach.
Any downside to this and how much does this add to the blockweight if anything at all.
