Perhaps instead of a flag that can be used to disable a specific operation,
there should be a "-ignoredflags=x,y,z" section of the URI that can be used
to ignore whatever BIP this might also be useful for in the future?

I don't think all BIPs lend themselves to this pattern. Can you think of
another example?
Not right now, just seemed like a good idea to consider making it useful
for more than one thing (maybe CT or something else could use it in the
I also suspect each ignored flag requires carefully defined behavior, so
it's probably better to spell that out in the BIP.
Agreed, no reason they couldn't reuse the same section of the payment
request URI though. (And define that behavior in the BIP)

Limiting the withdrawal outputs to P2PKH and perhaps P2WPKH (would there
be any network benefit to supporting witness pubkeys for withdrawals?)
wouldn't be too much work for me. The downside is that people might want
to withdraw to multisig scripts, or any other legitimate P2SH. If it
prevents a huge issue, then it is probably worth it.
I'm curious if anyone on this list could help answer this.

If users can opt-in to another security model, why can't they opt-in to
another scaling model? The mainchain (Bitcoin) does not have to adopt
any of the changes made to a sidechain such as larger blocks for example.

You guys are both right that it is a different security model, with the
important distinction that it is opt-in. What I disagree with about what
you said is only that we are encouraging more risky behavior by adding
consensus rules via softfork. There are additional risks with
drivechains, but not because of how the new consensus rules would be
added (it would be the same risk as the P2SH softfork).
What's been explained to me a few times is that the
anyone-can-spend-ness of new transaction types that depend on softforked
consensus rules are exponentially less risky to the point that it is
infeasible to steal them as blocks are added to the chain that activated
the soft fork. I believe that Luke-Jr and Lopp are both very good at
explaining this and I know that Lopp has actually done some research as
to the cost of stealing these outputs. I can't remember the link but you
might find that with a google. One of them might even chime in and
explain that I'm totally wrong again!
Sorry for being a bit heated in my last response.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP: OP_BRIBVERIFY - the op code needed for Blind 
In case anyone wants to do this, I added the CSidechainAddress class to the
mainchainBMM branch of the Drivechain project a long time ago. The only
purpose it serves right now is to show that sidechain deposit addresses can
start with a '4'. We could simply add the sha256 hash described by Paul to
a script with OP_RETURN at the front and make that the standard.
On Jul 12, 2017 4:47 PM, "Paul Sztorc via bitcoin-dev" <
That said, I am fully in favor of forcing the sidechain's permanent
deposit address to be equal to some deterministic function of the sha256
hash of its version 0.1 release.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Drivechain -- Request for Discussion 
Since the sidechain has the sidechain BMM headers that they want the LD
(bribe) data for, I think that they could specifically request LD data
relevant only to that sidechain by providing a list of hashes to the
mainchain, and the mainchain can return a list of boolean values telling
the sidechain if the LD data exists. That way the data never even has to
go over the network, just a verification that it exists on the mainchain
and we can drop the sidechain_id from the script.
Agreed, we need that.
No, OP_BRIBE (the old version) didn't care about the block height. Where
the blockheight was relevant is when bribe data is added to LD. In order
to be added to LD, the bribe needed to either be a fork (block height
less than the sidechain tip height) or extending the current side-chain
(block height = sidechain tip height + 1). The goal of this was to allow
for reorgs, and also make it so that people cannot skip forward (which
would never be valid so it's a waste of time and space) so that the
sidechain makes progress. With the new design that we have been talking
about, I think that we will need to drop this requirement from the
mainchain, and have the sidechain handle filtering out invalid LD data /
only requesting the verification of LD data that they know to be valid
as far as chain order goes.
Agreed. It might be helpful if you outlined the idea you had on IRC to
the mailing list.
I might be wrong but I thought that OP_RETURN outputs do not go into the
UTXO set. Anyone else want to chime in?

============================== START ==============================
To ZmnSCPxj:
I don't understand this part.  In my scheme, a sidechain cannot reorganize
unless the mainchain reorganizes, since the consensus loop only cares about
matching the current block; it ignores splits and does not consider them
But I suppose you are considering something like the Ethereum mutability
feature, which I do not think is something you would want in a sidechain.
The goal was to allow for sidechain reorgs without effecting the mainchain
at all. With the ratchet system (WIP) the sidechain miners can either move
the side chain forward or start a split at some previous sidechain block
height. This happens as the main chain moves forward normally.
withdrawals from sidechain to mainchain?  ...
The ratchet system is actually what links the h* data from bribes to
sidechain blocks. h*'s (which are sidechain block hashes) are added to the
ratchet system if they move the sidechain forward or start a split like I
mentioned before. Then a sidechain can request of their local mainchain
node to verify the headers they have downloaded from sidechain peers and
form the side chain.

Your assumptions of the bribe process are indeed correct you seem to
have a pretty good handle on all of that.
Hopefully I can clear up a few things. BMM among other things is still a
work in progress so you'll have to wait a
bit longer before any reorg code is on github. The "ratchet" system on
github right now just has the block hash
part of the critical hash script. The completed version needs to check
the sidechain number (ID) and the sidechain
block number in the script. Also the block number can only change by +1
or -1, so when a new h* is added to the
queue it must be compared to the most recent h* in the queue.
std::abs(queue.back().nHeight - ToAdd.nHeight) must equal 1.
Here's what the script looks like on github:
Note that the h* is just a block hash.
script << OP_RETURN << ToByteVector(h*);
Here's what I'm testing right now as I'm working on BMM:
script << OP_RETURN << CScriptNum::serialize(nSidechain) <<
CScriptNum(nSidechainHeight) << ToByteVector(sidechain blinded block
hash h*)
One other thing I want to make sure is clear enough is that the block
number in the critical hash script is
a sidechain block number, not a mainchain block number. That might mess
up the new format you have
suggested for bribes. And the reason a sidechain miner would want to
refund their bribe is if the h* doesn't
end up in a coinbase after a number of blocks, making their blinded
block on the sidechain invalid as tx's
will be spent in other blocks that do get their h* in a coinbase.
We were thinking about making bribe outputs have a maturity period like
generated coins. You
think that they should be locked for >100 blocks by having OP_BRIBE also
check the lock time?
I like all of your suggestions so far, thank you for taking a look!

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] SF proposal: prohibit unspendable outputs with 
After reading
I see that Adam is correct. Unfortunately this SF would make Felix's
confidential transactions
more complicated. The blinding and unblinding transactions would have to
be created with
minimal output values, and this will need to be considered when checking
that the fee is equal
to the total amount of input. (it would now be SUM(inputs) -
Blinding transaction:
  Ins:
    All non-confidential inputs are valid
  Outs:
  - 0..N: (new confidential outputs)
    amount: 0
    scriptPubkey: OP_2 <0x{32-byte-hash-value}>
    witnessOut: <0x{petersen-commitment}> <0x{range-proof}>
  - last:
    amount: 0
    scriptPubkey: OP_RETURN OP_2 {blinding-fee-amount}
  Fee: Sum of the all inputs value
However, looking at the format of the blinding transaction, and how the
GCTXO is added to the UTXO set
by miners, it seems that a change to the blinding scriptPubKey could
allow for the use of 0 value
outputs. Even with the SF proposed by this email thread.
OP_RETURN could be added to the scriptPubKey during blinding. The amount
and scriptPubKey destination of
unblinded funds is part of the witness and the outputs of an unblinded
transaction are unspendable, so
why not also make them unspendable in the blind transaction? As far as I
can tell those outputs don't need to
be spendable, they are really just encoding data. It doesn't seem like
anything besides the confidential base
transaction and the fee output from the blind transaction need to be in
the UTXO set.
Is it still possible to add this data to the witness if the scriptPubKey
is unspendable? :
witnessOut: <0x{petersen-commitment}> <0x{range-proof}>
I think I'm missing something obvious, someone point out why this is
stupid please :)

It's hard to disclose a bitcoin vulnerability considering the network is

that not already sort of how it works?

I do agree with you to a degree, but address reuse is actually not even
