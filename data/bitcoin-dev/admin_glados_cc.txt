@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Uniquely identifying forked chains 
There has been discussion of using the genesis block hash to identify
chains in BIP 21 (bitcoin:// URI scheme). However, this does not allow
identification between blockchain forks building upon the same genesis
block. While many see this as undesirable, I think it is inevitable that
this will eventually happen at some point, and think it is best to build
systems redundantly.
I propose identifying blockchains for BIP 21 and any other relevant needs
1) the genesis block hash for a new chain, or
2) a hash of the genesis block hash,  concatenated with block hash(es) of
fork point(s) for a fork chain
This would support forks, forks of forks, forks of forks of forks, etc
while preserving a fixed length chain identifier.
If a user wants to specify "whatever chain is the longest with PoW", they
would use (1). In times where multiple chains are coexisting and being
actively mined, a user can use (2) to specifically identify a chain.

I think 25% bandwidth savings is certainly considerable, especially for
people running full nodes in countries like Australia where internet
bandwidth is lower and there are data caps.
I absolutely would not dismiss 25% compression. gzip and bzip2 compression
is relatively standard, and I'd consider the point of implementation
complexity tradeoff to be somewhere along 5-10%.

I appreciate your interest in Bitcoin, but I trust that you understand your
proposal adds nothing to the current discussion and recommend you read more
emails from this mailing list.
