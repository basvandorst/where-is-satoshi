@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] IBLT & Bitcoin 
Hi all,
While in college (2017), I produced this paper on IBLT applications and
Bitcoin that referenced some of the research done by folks like Gavin
Andresen and Rusty Russell.
This should come with a disclaimer: I have not really looked at this paper
nor Bitcoin since 2017.  Additionally, this paper was not peer reviewed; it
was just for class.
Regardless, I came across it when I was cleaning out some old docs on my
drive and figured I'd send it over to bitcoin-dev in the event it can
contribute to anything at all.
