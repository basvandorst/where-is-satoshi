BIP70 is quite safe agains MitB. If user copies URL belonging to other
merchant, he would see the fact after entering it into his wallet
application. The only problem is, attacker can buy from the same
merchant with user's money. (sending him different URL) This can be
mitigated by merchant setting "memo" to the description of the basket
and some user info (e.g. address to which goods are sent).
But if whole computer is compromised, you're already screwed. Trezor
should help, but I'm not sure if it supports BIP70.

Good idea. I think this could be even better:
instead of using third party, send partially signed TX from computer
to smartphone. In case, you are paranoid, make 3oo5 address made of
two cold storage keys, one on desktop/laptop, one on smartphone, one
using third party.
If it isn't enough, add requirement of another four keys, so you have
three desktops with different OS (Linux, Windows, Mac) and three
mobile OS (Android, iOS, Windows Phone), third party and some keys in
cold storage. Also, I forgot HW wallets, so at least Trezor and
Ledger. I believe this scheme is unpenetrable by anyone, including
NSA, FBI, CIA, NBU...
Jokes aside, I think leaving out third party is important for privacy reasons.
Stay safe!

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Proposal for P2P Wireless (Bluetooth LE) 
I would like to shortly express my opinion:
- Having BT as an alternative is good idea but it must be secure enough
- Signed BIP70 should be enough. I see only two issues regarding BIP70
(but they apply also to TCP/IP, not just BT): key revocations and MITM
attacks by governments.
- Broadcasting faces is very bad idea IMHO.
- Comparing addresses seems complicated but if hash was displayed as a
unique, picture hard to be mistake or long phrase, it could be more
- Maybe storing public key (I do NOT mean bitcoin address!) of
merchant after successful transaction is good compromise?
Another idea: I noticed it's extremely easy to compare two strings if
they are the same size (in terms of millimeters, not number of
characters). If the hash of signing key was printed on a sign near the
POS in specified size (90% of smallest available screen?) and phone
would scale correctly, just putting the phone near the sign would be
enough to instantly spot whether the hashes are same.
Maybe instead of hex/base58 hash encoding use colored barcode. But I'm
not sure if it would improve things.

What about using encryption with forward secrecy? Merchant would
generate signed request containing public ECDH part, buyer would send
back transaction encrypted with ECDH and his public ECDH part. If
receiving address/amount is meant to be private, use commit protocol
(see ZRTP/RedPhone) and short authentication phrase (which is hard to
spoof thanks to commit protocol - see RedPhone)?

That's exactly what I though when seeing the RedPhone code, but after
I studied the commit protocol I realized it's actually secure and
convenient way to do it. You should do that too. :)
Shortly, how it works:
The initiator of the connection sends commit message containing the
hash of his temporary public ECDH part, second party sends back their
public ECDH part and then initiator sends his public ECDH part in
open. All three messages are hashed together and the first two bytes
are used to select two words from a shared dictionary which are
displayed on the screen of both the initiator and the second party.
The parties communicate those two words and verify they match.
If an attacker wants to do MITM, he has a chance of choosing right
public parts 1:65536. There is no way to brute-force it, since that
would be noticed immediately. If instead of two words based on the
first two bytes, four words from BIP39 wordlist were chosen, it would
provide entropy of 44 bits which I believe should be enough even for
paranoid people.
How this would work in Bitcoin payment scenario: user's phone
broadcasts his name, merchant inputs amount and selects the name from
the list, commit message is sent (and then the remaining two
messages), merchant spells four words he sees on the screen and buyer
confirms transaction after verifying that words match.

I believe, we are still talking about transactions of physical people in physical world. So yes, it's proximity based - people tell the words by mouth. :)
In case of RedPhone, you read those words verbally over not-yet-verified channel relying on difficulty of spoofing your voice. Also the app remembers the public keys, so you don't need to verify second time.
I suggest you to try RedPhone (called Signal on iPhone) yourself. It's free/open source, Internet-based and end-to-end encrypted. You may find it useful some day. Also I'm willing to help you with trying it after I wake up. (~8 hours: Send me private e-mail if you want to.)

I have never been against manual verification. What I'm trying to say
is let's just make manual verification easier and more secure.
Comparison of address is simpler for the coder but also simpler to
attack. It has these problems:
- Addresses broadcasted in plaintext (privacy issue)
- Amounts broadcasted in plaintext (privacy issue)
- Address is long - takes lot of time to verify (user experience issue)
- Address prefix can be brute-forced, if too short or used to make
"black hole" address if longer (vandalism issue)
Commit protocol can be used for both the encryption and the
authentication while user experience is not bad and everything is
still secure.

Just no.
This looks more interesting but is information about your location
really so secret that you need to hold it in HW wallet? Because if so,
you probably don't want to use untrusted machine anyway. (Or just use
Qubes OS.)

I'm not sure if I was clear enough. Handshake should be used to
establish authenticated AND encrypted communication using ECDH (or
just DH, but I think it's easier to use ECDH, since required functions
are already used in Bitcoin protocol), like RedPhone does. BTW
knowledge of verification string is useless to the attacker.
Yes, the customer must verify it verbally and the merchant shouldn't
send the transaction before verification. Other possibility is that in
case of differing verification strings new address is generated, so
attacker doesn't know the address. But in this case, amount is leaked
and there is quite high probability it can be found in the Blockchain.
Anyway, I don't believe the transaction can be made securely without
such interaction except with white-listing public keys, so I see no
reason why interaction should be problematic.
We don't have such strict regulations but I agree that security is
important. Currently I think that verbal verification and manual
confirmation is the best way to achieve high security and reasonable

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] New BIP: protocol for multisignature payments 
I've been thinking about how to solve security problems of the servers
holding huge amounts of bitcoins (exchanges, markets...) and came up
with this idea: TL;DR: it's extension of BIP70 (but not fully compatible due to security
reasons) which supports making of multisig transactions dynamically.
(The most important thing is that the user provides his address.)
What do you think? Is it a good way to solve the problem or do you know
about something better? I would really like this or something similar
implemented by wallets.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] User coordination of soft fork activation 
I'd appreciate if anyone would like to review my proposal on improving
UASFs, here's the link:
This document proposes a novel way to improve coordination of users who
wish to activate a new soft fork in Bitcoin. The main idea is to use smart
contracts to incentivize users to actually enforce the soft fork with lower
risk of support being too low. At the same time the contract is in effect
only if significant part of economy agrees to it. The contract also signals
the intent to miners and other users in a way that would be otherwise
expensive for sybil attackers. This proposal also suggests an interesting
way to pay developers for the development of the soft fork code.
FYI the document is timestamped in
