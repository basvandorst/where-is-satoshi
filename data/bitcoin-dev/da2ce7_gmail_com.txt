Namecoin makes sense; as we can use the same private keys to spend the
namecoin as spending the bitcoins.
Namecoin happens to be the only secure guaranteed global unique human
rememberable string system that exists.
I suggest that sending bitcoins to a namecoin name is the way to go...
It makes even more sense since namecoin started merged mining.

block limit.  The lock limits were unexpected, and could be considered
extremely uncontroversial to remove.
The discussion of larger blocks (i.e. > 1MB ),  that I happen to
disagree with,  is not relevant to the discussion of the removal of

I think that it is important to note that Bitcoin XT faces a natural
uphill battle.
Since it is possible to setup atomic inter-fork coin trades. I do not
see how Bitcoin XT could possibly win if Satoshi decides to sell 10000
XTBTC for BTC everyday for the first 100 days after the fork.
In many ways Satoshi gets to decide the winning fork just by his huge
economic investment in Bitcoin.
Here is some simple game-theory for non-consensus forks:
1. Spoil the ballot. Have Bitcoin Core propagate the Bitcoin XT version
2. Encourage all miners to false vote for the Bitcoin XT fork.
- Now people have no-idea what % of the economy Bitcoin XT holds. -
Making it impossible for people to put economic faith behind Bitcoin XT.
3. Setup good Atomic Swap markets.
4. Setup a fork of Bitcoin XT that allows people to easily make a
transaction only on the XT fork (while leaving the original BTC coins
This means that the Bitcoin XT fork will be born per-mature. Probably
with only a small % of hashing power behind it (contrary to the almost
100% that falsely claim to support it). It will be embarrassing that for
the goal of larger blocks, XT instead has blocks (before re-adjustment)
every 2h.
The price for XTBTC coins will plummet, Satoshi progressively dumping
his 1M stash over a year or so will make sure that it doesn't recover
I cannot see how Bitcoin XT is but-not in a extremely weak position from
game theory.
I'm sure smarter people than I could come up with even more ways to
disrupt non-consensus forks.

Since it was a game theory analysis. I will not address your other comments.
There are a few ways: here is my favorite (for the moment).
1. Spam the 8mb blocks with 1 Satoshi outputs to the brainwallet 'BitcoinXT'
2. Let these spam tx be in BitcoinXT, however not Bitcoin (easily done).
3. Let the forked XT client includes a unspent dust output with any
transaction. Let the this client create 100 dust outputs for other
people to use in the same transaction.
This transaction will only be possible to confirm with Bitcoin XT. -
Leaving your Bitcoin coins untouched.
I particularly like this approach, as it is ironic as the spam is more
cheaply done with larger blocks.
A quick political note:
Hard forks are not something that is a democratic process. Thus
frustrating a false-democratic process is completely legitimate.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Mechanics of a hard fork 
Hash: SHA256
While being in the Bitcoin community for a long time, I haven't been
so directly involved in the development.  However I wish to suggest a
different pre-hard-fork soft-fork approach:
Set a 'block size cap' in the similar same way as we set difficulty.
Every 2016 blocks take the average size of the blocks and multiply the
size by 1.5x, rejecting blocks that are larger than this size, for the
next 2016 period.
I would of-course suggest that we keep the limits at min 100kb and max
(initially) 990kb (not 1mb on purpose, as this should become the new
limit), rounding up to the nearest 10kb.
A: we don't have pressure at the 1mb limit, (we reduce the limit in a
flexible manner to 990kb).
B: we can upgrade the network to XYZ hard-limit, then slowly raze the
soft-limit after being sure the network, as-a-whole is ready.
If we on-day remove the block-size limit, this rule will stop a rouge
miner from making 10mb, or 100mb blocks, or 1gb blocks.
This could be implemented by the miners without breaking any of the
clients, and would tend to produce a better dynamic fee pressure.
This will give the mechanics to the miners to create consensus to
agree what block-sizes they believe are best for the network, and
allows the block-sizes to dynamically grow in response to larger demand.

@_date: 2015-05-30 09:36:39
@_author: Cameron Garnham 
@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Proposed alternatives to the 20MB step 
First off, I am glad that the idea of dynamic block size adjustment is
gaining some attention, in particular the model that I proposed.
I wanted to take some time and explain some of the philosophy of how,
and why, I proposed this this particular model.
When Bitcoin was first made, there was a 32MB block size limit; this
was quickly found to be open to spam (and potentially DOS, as the code
was not-at-all optimized to support large blocks), and was reduced to
1MB, this was a quick fix that was never intended to last; at some
point the network should come to an understanding, a consensus if you
will, of what (and how much) belongs in a block.
The core point of this is that miners have always, and will always;
hold the power, to decide what goes into blocks; this implicitly,
obviously, includes how large blocks are. Miners are able to come any
sort of agreement they wish, providing the bitcoin clients accept
their blocks as valid.
Say if Satoshi never decided to place the 1MB block limit: It would be
up to the miners to decide what they consider a ?reasonable? block is.
However, they would need to find some way to communicate this and
reach an agreement; some protocol.  They, say, could have done this
informally on what is now the bitcointalk forum, or used Twitter.
However, what they really need is indeed a "consensus protocol". Some
simple terms to define what is acceptable and what is not.
Hence, the proposal introducing a consensus protocol for block sizes;
instead of just having a hard limit (enforced by everyone), instead,
we have a constant factor above the average block size over a fixed
intervals that is soft-forked by only the miners. (The next simplest
mathematical construct).
This proposal is entirely a soft-fork and may be implemented without
changing any client code what so ever. In-fact, it could be
implemented by only a simple 51% majority of miners, with-or-without
gaining the wider community consensus. (Assuming that the 1MB block
size rule still applies).
The nice thing about this is that it really is impossible to stop,
for-example, if pre-relaying of block headers is implemented; the
miners could always soft-fork to include the block-size in the
coinbase. The only reason that the miners have not done this yet, is
that there has not yet been a strong will to increase transaction fees.
If we assume the miners will operate in a way to collectively maximize
profit; then we can assume they will not try to maximize utility of
the network (having as many transactions as possible), rather have as
few transactions as the total economy can support the cost.  Meaning
that limiting to much smaller blocks will probably be much more
profitable than having large blocks.
Since there is no requirement for the clients to know about the block
size consensus protocol, this truly can be a
?bi-directional-soft-fork?, in that the miners can choose to change
the rules at any time, with only a simple 51% majority. Therefore, any
parameters that we pick are always up for debate.
Why the 1.5x over 2016 blocks? -  Using some game theory, and
deduction: I wished to pick the type of agreement that would be
natural for the miners to come to (selfishly).
First, Why 1.5x, this means that only a super-majority of miners can
easily increase the block size. ? There is no natural incentive for
miners to produce large blocks that have very few fees.
Second, Why 2016 blocks for adjusting the average:  Miners HATE
unpredictability, for shorter time periods the miner will need to have
infrastructure ready to support potentially much larger block almost
immediately. 2016 blocks is a period that the miners are already well
used to, meaning that it will take slightly less than a month for
blocks of double size to be permitted.
This entire infrastructure can be implemented without needing to
update any clients; once implemented, tested, solid, and well accepted
by the (mining) community then we can revisit increasing the 1M hard
limit. (If we still have demand for it, maybe the average block size
will reduce to say, 100KB).

Unauthenticated link level encryption is wonderful! MITM attacks are overrated; as they require an active attacker.
Stopping passive attacks is the low hanging fruit. This should be taken first.
Automated and secure peer authentication in a mesh network is a huge topic. One of the unsolved problems in computer science.
A simple 'who is that' by asking for the fingerprint of your peers from your other peers is a very simple way to get 'some' authentication.  Semi-trusted index nodes also is a low hanging fruit for authentication.
However, let's first get unauthenticated encryption. Force the attackers to use active attacks. (That are thousands times more costly to couduct).

There are two different topics mixed up here.
1. Link-level security (secure connection to the node we intended to connect to).
2. Node-level security (aka; don't connect to a 'evil node').
The fist requires link-level encryption and authentication.
The second requires identity authentication.
You described the 'evil node' attack; that indeed needs an identity system to stop. However BIP151 doesn't intend to protect against connecting to evil Bitcoin Nodes.
It is important not to mixup link-level authentication and node-level authentication.
When your client picks random nodes to connect to, you are not considered whom in particular runs them. (Rather that you have a good random sample of the network).
If you manually add a friends node; at this point you wish to have node-level authentication.  However, this may (and probably should) happen out-of-band.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] I do not support the BIP 148 UASF 
It is hard for me to come out disagreeing with Maxwell, however in this case I feel I must.
As many may remember, there was quite some controversy about the BIP16 vs BIP 17 split; the main argument for BIP16 was the urgency of P2SH, and how this was the already ?tested and proven to work? solution.
I was one of the man hold-out supporters of BIP17, not for any clear reason (I now have a much better technical understanding of the Bitcoin technical details, as we all do); But because it was the ?more elegant? solution.  I knew from other fields of engineering that elegant solutions very often better deal with the ?unknown, unknowns?.  I also didn?t agree with Gavin?s ?the sky is falling? sense of urgency.
However, of-course the community got behind BIP16, it was activated, fortunately, without any signifiant incident.
I did learn that in Bitcoin there is something more valuable than technical elegance: that is community buy-in. On the technical side, the engineers need to make sure the solutions are viable: however on the community side we need to make sure that the good solutions are adopted in a reasonable timeframe.
It is both my empirical view and heart-felt belief that the wider Bitcoin Community wants SegWit quickly. In this case the sacrifice of some technical elegance and correctness for expediency is prudent!
It is my unfortunate view that Maxwell is missing the political forest for the technical trees.  Not only is SegWit a technical solution to technical problems; it has come to represent, by the larger Bitcoin Community, a political solution to the conflict that we are waist-deep in every, single, day.
BIP 148 is out terms of peace.  The Bitcoin Community is tired-to-death of this war and wants a resolution swiftly. BIP 148 proves a outlet, and in Maxwell words: ?...almost guarantees at a minor level of disruption.?.
I am willing to go through this minor level of disruption, as the daily disruption from the ?scaling debate war?; in my personal online life, is far greater.
SegWit is a exceptional feat of engineering, it solves and mitigates so many small and highly subtle issues within Bitcoin; yet still managed to be simple enough successfully reviewed: now the community is clearly calling for a quick activation of the ?viable? technical choice.
If you/we are going to provide any engineering solution to activating SegWit, then Swiftness should be the 1st priority after viability.
BIP 148 is both Swift and Viable.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] I do not support the BIP 148 UASF 
Thank-you for your prompt response,
I believe I must have a different prospective of Bitcoin to you.  Ideologically I don?t agree that miners can be passive participants in the Bitcoin Network; and I certainly don?t see them acting as passive participants in the Bitcoin Community now.
The miners are very much political actors.  Hence why I fail to take-to-heart your concern "that the proposal will reject the blocks of passive participants?.
With AsicBoost, there are three miner groups: Those who use it (and have legal sanction to do so); Those who use it (without legal sanction); and those who don?t use it.  If SegWit didn?t directly affect miners, then one could possibly claim that there could be an ideal passive participant miner in reality. However since your important revelations on AsicBoost: SegWit cannot be a ?passive? option for miners.
Hence, I don?t care about orphaning the blocks of of the theoretical "passive participant? miner. As I have no logical reasoning to suggest one could exists; and a large amount of evidence to suggesting one dose not exit.
On BIP 16 vs. BIP 17;  I cannot see how BIP 148 similar engineering tradeoffs.  Is there any long-term ?technical debt? from BIP 148 that I?m unaware of that could be similar to BIP 16?
On the Drama:  Well 100M USD p/a can pay for lots of Drama; Hence going back to the first point: The miners are not passive participants when it comes to *any* form of activation of SegWit.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Exploring Network Rule Changes 
I have taken some time to think about consensus systems in-general; and write up a guide that explores the problems space of changing the rules of such systems.
Hopefully, this guide will clarify the different options available to the Bitcoin Community.
I am posting this to the Bitcoin Development mailing list for review. Possibly a more comprehensive form of this document could be useful as an informative BIP.
** Type of Change **
There are three categories of changes:
S:	Addition of a new Rule. (Soft-Fork)
H:	Removal of an old Rule. (Hard-Fork)
E:	Subverting an old Rule. (?Evil?, Non-Traditional Soft-Fork)
* Addition of a new Rule:
All previous rules in the system remain enforced as originally intended.
There are two sub-categories for the addition of a new rule:
1:	New Functionally is added to the system, without effecting old use cases. (Opt-In New Functionality)
2:	Functional users of the system must change their behaviour to suit the new rule. (Mandatory New Functionality)
* Removal of an old Rule
Equivalent replacing the entire system with any-new system.  All full-users of the system must migrate to the new system.
* Subverting an old Rule
New Functionally is added that explicitly Replaces Old Functionality.
Users must upgrade and migrate to the new Functionally to continue using the system.
** Type of Activation **
There are two types of activations:
U.	External Activations. (User Activated)
M.	Internal Activations. (Miner Activated, PoS Activated, Internal Governance Model, etc)
It is possible to have more than one Activation Strategy used concurrently.
* External Activations
These Activations are dictated by facts that are not quantifiable from within the System.
Generally, this will be a set-of-users, external to the system, that come to their own agreement to change the system.
* Internal Activations
These activations use some metric from within the system to determine if a proposed change is activated.
Generally, some sort of internal signalling or vetoing process will happen and based upon its results, will dictate the if the change is activated.
** Type of Signalling **
Users within the system with more important roles may wish to (or be forced to) signal or (not) veto about a particular topic. This could be part of the activation strategy (internal activations), or just simply to quantify the support of the upcoming change.
There are two core types of Signalling:
O:	Optional
F.	Forced
There are two styles of Signalling:
N.	Normal Signalling (Opt-In)
V.	Veto (Opt-Out)
* Optional Signalling
Orthogonal to the system rules; however, the signalling still may affect other system rules.
* Enforced Signalling
This is a meta-rule change. Normally only temporally enforced upon the system. This rule change doesn?t directly affect the core behaviour of the system; it is just used for meta-purposes in the scope of another rule change.
* Normal Signalling
Passive Behaviour signals no support.
* Veto Signalling
Passive Behaviour signals support.
If I have missed anything or if anything is not clear, please contact me.
For example, you could call a BIP9 (SegWit) activation as a:  ?S1MON".  And BIP 148 (SegWit) as:  ?S1UFN?.  However this letter code is just for fun. :)

BIP: ???
  Layer: Consensus (soft fork)
  Title: Strong Anti-Replay via Coinbase Transactions
  Author: Cameron Garnham   Comments-Summary: No comments yet.
  Comments-URI:   Status: Draft
  Type: Standards Track
  Created: 2017-03-25
  License: BSD-3-Clause
           CC0-1.0
This document specifies a soft fork that enables users to make transactions with a strong expectation that such transactions cannot be replayed on a different chain.
Important Note: In the case that an adversary hard-fork, the strong guarantee of non-replayabilty via this BIP may not be supported.
In the case of a chain split, it is important to protect users from, potentially significant, loss of funds from transaction replay attacks.
Upon activation of the soft-fork (activation methodology undefined in this proposal), the following new rules become activated on the Bitcoin Network.
New ?anti-replay? OpCode.  Take an unused NoOp and redefine it as ?OP_ANTI_REPLAY?.
The script must only have the form:
scriptPubKey: (empty)
scriptSig: OP_ANTI_REPLAY
OP_ANTI_REPLAY has the following specification:
The Bitcoin Network should maintain a total of exactly 100 000 OP_ANTI_REPLAY outputs, with the exception of the the first 99 blocks after activation of this soft fork.
Upon activation of this soft fork.  Every blocks coinbase transaction will be required to create exactly 1000 new OP_ANTI_REPLAY outputs, up to the total of 100 000.
If a OP_ANTI_REPLAY is spent in a block, a corresponding new OP_ANTI_REPLAY must be included in the same block.
It is recommend the miners account the size of a OP_ANTI_REPLAY transaction as:  transactions size + size of a OP_ANTI_REPLAY output in coinbase.
In the case of an chain split after this BIP has activated, miners should ?recycle? all the OP_ANTI_REPLAY outputs via spending and recreating them in new blocks.  Renewing the protection to the new chain.
=== Reference implementation ===
==Backwards Compatibility==
This deployment is compatible with all existing bitcoin software.
Upon activation, all deployed Bitcoin Full Nodes will enforce the anti-replay projections for Bitcoin Users. (Only upgraded nodes will enforce the other OP_ANTI_REPLAY requirements).
The only know way of guaranteeing that a transaction cannot be replayed is to include an input that cannot exist, by-definition, on the alternative chain.  Coinbase transactions are the only transaction type that is know to exhibit this property strongly.
This BIP makes it convenient for wallets to automate the inclusion of new coinbase inputs into transactions that spend potentially repayable transactions.  Everything in this BIP could be done manually by close cooperation between the users and miners, however the author thinks that it is preferable to have it well-defined and enforced.
On Opt-In-RBF enforcement:  In the case of conflicting spends of OP_ANTI_REPLAY outputs, the higher-fee transaction should take priority.  Wallets may select a random OP_ANTI_REPLAY, then check if the competing transaction has a sufficiently low fee to be replaced.
It is expected that every OP_ANTI_REPLAY output will be in the memory pools waiting to be spend; users must compete for this resource.

Hello Bitcoin Development Mailing List,
I wish to explain why the current approach to ?ASICBOOST? dose not comply with our established best practices for security vulnerabilities and suggest what I consider to be an approach closer matching established industry best practices.
1.     Significant deviations from the Bitcoin Security Model have been acknowledged as security vulnerabilities.
The Bitcoin Security Model assumes that every input into the Proof-of-Work function should have the same difficulty of producing a desired output.
2.     General ASIC optimisation cannot be considered a Security Vulnerabilities.
Quickly being able to check inputs is not a vulnerability. However, being able to craft inputs that are significantly easier to check than alternative inputs is a vulnerability.
3.     We should assign a CVE to the vulnerability exploited by ?ASICBOOST?.
?ASICBOOST? is an attack on this Bitcoin?s security assumptions and should be considered an exploit of the Bitcoin Proof-of-Work Function.
For a more detailed look at ?ASICBOOST?, please have a look at this excellent document by Jeremy Rubin:
The Bitcoin Community should be able to track the progress of restoring the quality of the Bitcoin Proof-of-Work function to its original assumptions.
4.     Work should be taken to prudently and swiftly restore Bitcoins Security Properties.
I recommend the Bitcoin Community fix this vulnerability with expediency.
With a soft-fork it probably is possible to completely fix this Proof-of-Work vulnerability.
(Here is my working list of things to do):
1.     Include extra data in the Coinbase Transaction, such as the Witness Root.
2.     Lock the Version. (Use a space in the Coinbase Transaction for signalling future upgrades).
3.     Lock the lower-bits on the Timestamp: Block timestamps only need ~1minute granularity.
4.	Make a deterministic ordering of transaction chains within a block. (However, I believe this option is more difficult).
Of course, if we have a hard-fork, we should consider the Proof-of-Work internal merkle structure directly.

Hello Tier,
Thank-you for your insightful reply,
Am I correct that this suggest is that you think it is an optimisation to find some nonces having lower difficulty than other nonces?
I would agree with you if this was limited to a dedicated nonce area of the Bitcoin System.
However, in the case of Bitcoin it is a layer violation that the PoW function difficulty could be affected by the choice the transaction ordering, or the content of the Coinbase Transaction, etc.  Possibly giving unnatural and unintended incentives to other parts of the Bitcoin System.
I can see two issues at play here:
1.	The choice of input, outside of the dedicated nonce area, fed the PoW function should not change it?s difficulty to evaluate.
2.	Every PoW function execution should be independent.
I think that both of these are security assumptions of the Bitcoin PoW function.
I consider ASICBOOST as an attack upon both accounts.

Hello Bitcoin-Dev,
A quick update that CVE-2017-9230 has been assigned for the security vulnerability commonly called ?ASICBOOST?:
"The Bitcoin Proof-of-Work algorithm does not consider a certain attack methodology related to 80-byte block headers with a variety of initial 64-byte chunks followed by the same 16-byte chunk, multiple candidate root values ending with the same 4 bytes, and calculations involving sqrt numbers. This violates the security assumptions of (1) the choice of input, outside of the dedicated nonce area, fed into the Proof-of-Work function should not change its difficulty to evaluate and (2) every Proof-of-Work function execution should be independent.?

Hello Bitcoin-Dev,
CVE-2017-9230 (1) (2), or commonly known as ?ASICBOOST? is a severe (3) (4) and actively exploited (5) security vulnerability.
To learn more about this vulnerability please read Jeremy Rubin?s detailed report:
Andreas Antonopoulos has an excellent presentation on why asicboost is dangerous:
In decisions on the  IRC channel; It was proposed, without negative feedback, that SegWit be used as a partial-mitigation of CVE-2017-9230.
SegWit partially mitigates asicboost with the common reasonable assumption that any block that doesn?t include a witness commit in it's coinbase transaction was mined using covert asicboost.  Making the use of covert asicboost far more conspicuous.
It was also proposed that this partial mitigation should be quickly strengthened via another soft-fork that makes the inclusion of witness commits mandatory, without negative feedback.
The security trade-offs of deploying a partial-mitigation to CVE-2017-9230 quickly vs more slowly but more conservatively is under intense debate.  The author of this post has a strong preference to the swiftest viable option.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Emergency Deployment of SegWit as a partial 
Thank you for your reply Andreas,
I can assure you that I have many motivations for activating SegWit.
Before studding ASICBOOST I wanted to activate SegWit as it is a wonderful upgrade for Bitcoin. It seems to me that virtually the entire Bitcoin Ecosystem agrees with me.  Except for around 67% of the mining hash-rate who very conspicuously refuse to signal for it?s activation. So, I started searching for the motivations of such a large amount of the mining hash-rate holding a position that isn?t at-all represented in the wider Bitcoin Community. My study of ASICBOOST lead to a ?bingo? moment:  If one assumes that the 67% of the hash rate that refuse to signal for SegWit are using ASICBOOST. The entire picture of this political stalemate became much more understandable.
This only strengthened my resolve to activate SegWit: not only is SegWit great, it partially mitigates a very serious security vulnerability.
This is why I call into question why you would suggest:
?This proposal is unnecessarily conflating two contentious issues and will attract criticism of self serving motivation.?
1. I am not conflating the issues.  I would argue that very fact that SegWit has not been activated yet is directly because of CVE-2017-9230.
2. I have no reason to believe that SegWit is contentious, except for the attackers who it would frustrate.
3. I have no negative responses to my endeavours to get ASICBOOST as regarded as a legitimate security vulnerability.  This would suggest that it is not contentious in the wider technical community.
If SegWit is NOT contentious within the technical community and it is NOT contentious to regard CVE-2017-9230 as a credible security vulnerability. Then using it as partial security fix for a security vulnerability SHOULD NOT be contentious.
If you believe that SegWit is contentious within the technical community.  Or you believe CVE-2017-9230 should not be regarded as a credible security vulnerability. Then I would logically agree with you that we should separate the issues so that we may gain consensus. However, I just don?t see this as the case.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Emergency Deployment of SegWit as a partial 
Hello Eric,
Thank you for your question and your time off-list clarifying your position. I?m posting to the list so that a wider audience may benefit.
Original Question: ?Presumably the "very serious security vulnerability" posed is one of increased centralization of hash power. Would this danger exist without the patent risk??
I would postulate that if ASICBOOST was originally released without the patent risk, then much of the risk would have been avoided; all of the mining manufactures would have implemented ASICBOOST and had a similar advantage. However, now time has passed and the damage of the patent monopoly exploiting CVE-2017-9230 has been already done. If the ASICBOOST patent was released to the public for free today, while a good thing, it wouldn?t soften the severity of the vulnerability we face today.
The ASICBOOST PATENT provides a miner with a constant-factor advantage. This is a huge problem with zero-sum games, such as mining. In game-theory, a constant factor advantage gives an exponential advantage over the time period maintained.
This explains why the Bitcoin Community initially took very little notice to ASICBOOST: The effects of ASICBOOST stated at virtually nothing, and it took a while for the advantage to been seen over the normal variance of mining. However, it?s influence has been exponentially growing since then: creating an emergency problem that we now face.
The result of ASICBOOST going unchecked is that very quickly from now, surprisingly quickly, the only profitable miners will be the miners who make use of ASICBOOST.  This is a grave concern.
I will again reiterate that the virtue-signalling over perceived political motivations is ridiculous in the light what I consider a looming catastrophe, we should be judging by what is real not just perceived.
The catastrophe that I fear is one company (or a single politically connected group) gaining a virtual complete monopoly of Bitcoin Mining. This is more important to me than avoiding chain-splits.  Without a well-distributed set of miners Bitcoin isn?t Bitcoin.
This attack is part of a larger set of licensing attacks, where patens are just one form of licensing attack. These attacks are particularly damaging in competitive markets such as mining. We should be vigilant for other attempts to create state-enforced licensing around mathematical algorithms.  ASICBOOST is an illustrative example of what the Bitcoin Community needs to defend against.
