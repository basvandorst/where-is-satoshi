@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] [Meta] bitcoin-dev moderation 
In the last  IRC meeting, the mailing list moderation
was slightly discussed. It was decided to do this discussion mainly on
this mailing list (which makes sense).
The current situation is that the moderation is slow and takes around
Jonas Schnelli proposed: "I propose that we add more moderators to
shorten the moderation lag which has been between >24h, thus makes
debates cumbersome"
Beside this I had the idea of people who already contributed n e-mails
to the mailing list don't need an approval for any e-mail anymore (Where
n is the number of previous e-mails). Does this exists already?

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] testnet4 
Hello, I tried myself with some Bitcoin development. For this I used of course the Bitcoin testnet. However it took me one hour to sync the blockchain with around 1538358 blocks. In my opinion that is too much for a testnet. Especially the blockchain size with around 26GB is so much. Would it be possible to reset the testnet with a new genesis block ? And if so, can we setup a fixed cycle for resetting the testnet (For example every second 1st of January) ?

I don't get why the testnet shouldn't be resetted just because there is a (probably better) alternative for it. The testnet is still a thing and is also used.

But using the testnet means that you actually need to deal with resets. There were 2 resets in the past but the last was in 2011.

Indeed a large testnet blockchain has advantages too.
But because it is the testnet and the testnet coins have no value, the
blockchain could be 'spammed' after a reset for some days/weeks until it
has a certain size.
Could this be realistic solution ?

1. We have Lightning and SegWit so thankfully we do not need to deal with
blocksizes anymore really.
2. What if a reorg happens? Then it could generate huge problems at the

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIPable-idea: Consistent and better definition of the 
Hello dear mailing list subscribers.
Before I'll explain my idea here, I need to define a term first
When I use the terms address, pubkey, etc., I mean the same: The Base58
Ok now let's get into it:
As you should know, sending bitcoins to an address more than once is a
very bad approach.
In my opinion the problem why so many people are still doing this is
because of the term 'address' which is used in lots of wallets,
implementations, BIP 21 and so on. It is a design issue.
With the term 'address' most people identify things that are fixed and
don't change really often (e.g postal address, IP address [depends on
provider], Domain, E-Mail address, ...).
Because of this most people compare bitcoin addresses with e-mail
addresses and use this address to send the recipient money multiple times.
My suggestion would be to change the term address in wallets, the URI
scheme and so on to something of the following options by a
Informational/Process BIP:
* Payment Password
* Transaction Password
* ...
The guideline for the term should indicate that it is:
* temporary
* Something that identifies the recipient
I've chosen 'password' because they can be used as a pseudonym to
identify a person.
This is already used in stuff like bank transfers where something like
the transaction id should be used as the purpose or at universities
there are student numbers.
The first is probably a better example because student numbers aren't
What do you think? Should I write a BIP for this or use another term?
Feedback is most welcome :)

I don't know much about this topic in Bitcoin so far, but I meant the
address :)
I meant this the whole time, sorry for misunderstandings.
Why? They are specifications and implementations need them (even if some
do not implement everything).
Also BIP 21 would need an alternative/separate parameter with the new term.
In Germany at least (where I live), you need to provide a 'Password'
(the german translation of thin word of course) in the purpose of the
transaction if you pay with a bank transfer. They are used as IDs but I
agree, ID is definitely a better suffix.

* Sorry if this mail was sent multiple times, my E-Mail client went crazy *
Thanks for all your feedback.
I came to the decision to write a BIP for this, even if it might not be
implemented by many wallets, a standardization is never wrong and this
would be the first step in the correct direction for better on-chain
However currently we still need a good term for the 'address' replacement.
The current suggestions are:
* Invoice ID
* Payment Token
* Bitcoin invoice (address)
* Bitcoin invoice (path)
Because of the LN term invoice I really like the term 'Bitcoin Invoice'
by Chris Belcher.
So how do find a consensus about these terms?

I personally do not like the term bulla, it might be a perfect analogy
but I personally don't believe that this term is well known. Tbh I
didn't knew what a 'bulla' was before.
I'm neutral on this. With code I associate something that is slightly
more permanent like a code to unlock your mobile phone or a code to
unlock your bike if you know what I mean. These kind of codes change
sometimes but not as often as a bitcoin address (should).
I also agree that Payment Tokens might confuse with other currencies and
block chain.
What is with 'Bitcoin Invoice Address'?
This is the best of both worlds because it implies the temporary factor
with 'invoice' and the way that you send something to something.
Also, this is more a personal opinion but I thunk that 'funding' implies
more to donate to something. I think this could lead to misunderstandings.
To summarize it up, here are the following suggested terms:
* Invoice ID
* Payment Token
* Bitcoin invoice (address)
* Bitcoin invoice (path)
* Bulla
* Funding code

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] [BIP-able idea] Regular testnet reset 
Hello, I'm thinking about writing a BIP about resetting the testnet on
regular/scheduled basis
The idea works like this:
* Every 210000 block is being used as the genesis of a completely new chain.
* The old one gets forgotten
* No chain can be longer than 210000 blocks
The problems are:
* How to get this working with testnet3? Only a hardfork probably.
* Is it that easy to change the chain while Bitcoin Core is running?
Probably the blocks need to be appended to the cureent one. After a
restart it would get patched
* Could the the chain derive into multiple once at every reset? (Planned
What do you think about the idea?
