@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Dedicated server for bitcoin.org, 
Hello, re. the dedicated server for bitcoin.org idea, I have a few thoughts
1) I have commented in a blogpost of August 2013 at
 with some thoughts relative to possible
issues with CA related to bitcoin.org - where I mentioned something
relative to the DigiCert certificate,
"DigiCert ?may revoke a Certificate, without notice, for the reasons
stated in the CPS, including if DigiCert reasonably believes that? (?)
?Applicant is added to a government list of prohibited persons or entities
or is operating from a prohibited destination under the laws of the United
States? (?) ?the Private Key associated with a Certificate was disclosed
or Compromised?"
In the same post I mentioned
"Bitcoin.org has no certificate, no encryption ? a situation which has its
own obvious problems. Bitcoin.org currently sends users to download the
bitcoin-qt client from sourceforge. Sourceforge is encrypted and has a
certificate based on GeoTrust:
(Currently (Dec. 7, 2013) bitcoin.org shows as 'not verified' and 'not
encrypted' examining it in a cursory fashion w/ Chrome)
Not sure how this would work, but it would be nice to see the content at
bitcoin.org encrypted, of course, but also further decentralized? how many
mirrors are there of bitcoin.org - not sure, but a few things that come to
mind when thinking of this are Tahoe-LAFS and also .bit stuff (namecoin). There are many ways to decentralize something but that is just something
that comes to mind.
This has been discussed at ('Is Bitcoin.org a weakness of bitcoin?) in the past and see also this
 which discusses mirroring
of certain content
Some things to think about.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Malware authors and best practices for 
I have a request, which is how do developers address the circumstance in
which someone utilizes your code as part of some effort to deprive (or
steal as the case may be) someone of their bitcoin?
This hasn't happened to me, but I have posed a question about it at
It was prompted by the apparent use of sx by a malware author who then
generated something called Stealthbit (which is malware, and which no-one
should touch).  [fortunately I have not tried to access or use
Stealthbit.)  However, this is a question that also touches on bitcoin
development generally, due to that (it's happened before, it will happen
again, etc.) people may end up using bitcoin code (if they haven't
already) to develop something else that would then be used expressly to
deprive someone of their bitcoins (such as steal them, but I am not
thinking only of theft here).  My question for developers is:  Given that
code is open source and anything can be done with it, good or bad, what
are common development approaches to mitigate or potentially prevent
malware authors from being able to easily appropriate the code you
I realize this question may sound dumb and out of place being that it is
pretty obvious that code which is developed in a free, open source context
can technically be used for anything.  However, beyond suggesting that
people just go to bitcoin.org for wallet technology, what can be done in
the development community that would lessen the likelihood that the code
you develop might be "misappropriated?"  Please note: I am not sure how
this issue might be approached from a development perspective, or license
(MIT, Affero GPL, etc.) perspective, or any other perspective.. I'm just
asking the question.  I support bitcoin and other decentralized currency
efforts including walled development such as darkwallet, and I appreciate
what you all are doing.  Maybe I'm asking the wrong question and it should
be put another way, but I hope you will rephrase my question(s) in a way
that makes more sense in the context of the list discussion here.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Bitcoin strengthening, giving, 
My apologies, to start with, as I am temporarily unable to reply directly
to the thread.  I am remembering this conversation due to a few things:
1) the discussion re. extending the payment protocol with new fields
2) discussions about "long addresses"
3) bitcoin strengthening / decentralization / cex.io,ghash.io growth etc.
4) microdonation / giving / microtransaction development, e.g.
coinbase-bitmonet Android SDK,
5) multisignature via browser, e.g. Different thoughts are running through my head here, so I will make a
sincere effort to coagulate them into a couple of meaningful and coherent
questions, and perhaps as time goes on, an issue or BIP.  However, I will
precede this with a "scenario" and with some "possibilities" (all of which
are hypothetical - I think) before presenting the "questions" below.
                          V
Suppose that there were to exist a method of extending the payment
protocol such that either "very long addresses" or multiple addresses were
presented by default from within the bitcoin client.  In the scenario
being imagined here, the standard option would exist to enter a payment
address directly.  However, coupled with this would be an option to enable
microdonations (or put another way, multiple transactions associated with
each instance of use of the protocol to facilitate a purchase) as a
default (as background activity automatically corresponding to any given
transaction). Whether or not this process is engaged in would be entirely
voluntary, in other words, users' choice.
The addresses to which this giving or microdonation would occur would be
stipulated by the user but also would be limited to the ability of the
network to support this microdonation process.
So, for example:
1) Let us say that you are to buy a piece of gum and the price of that
piece of gum is 0.00008 BTC.
    1)a.  The user has the ability to support additional (individuals,
organizations, causes, etc) for each transaction (instance of use of
the protocol to facilitate a purchase).
    1)b.  The user has set as a default to be "microdonated" each time a
transaction occurs, the following:
          1)b.1 0.0003 BTC to Sean's Outpost
          1)b.2 0.0004 BTC to a cousin who has a medical debt
          1)b.3 0.00006 BTC to a multisignature account which is intended
to "give youth a future and old age a security"
( Re:  )
          1)b.4 0.00005 BTC to a future US gov't-run Social Security address
          1)b.5 0.0002 BTC to an anarchist collective's donation address
          1)b.6 0.0002 BTC to a personal investment or retirement account
     1)c. The user then purchases a compound bow for 0.17 BTC.  The
purchase occurs the day after the gum purchase was initiated.  The
user has left the default microdonation settings in place, so Sean's
Outpost, the cousin, the multisignature account, the US gov't run
Social Security address, the anarchist collective, and the personal
investment / retirement account all receive something (automatically)
again as per the user's settings.
2) Some Possibilities (depending on implementation):
    2)a. The transaction completes for the purchase of gum but the
microtransactions are not allowed to complete until the compound bow
purchase is complete due to that the gum price is lower than the
collective microdonations which are set by the user as default.
    2)b. The transaction for the purchase of gum is not completed due to
the user realizing that the fee will be larger than the price of gum,
but the microdonations are completed (the user has opted to allow them
to occur anyway) and transaction(s) confirmed.  Subsequently, the
compound bow purchase occurs and the microdonations are given again.
    2)c.  The transaction for the purchase of gum is completed and the
microdonations are completed, everything is confirmed, the next day
the same thing happens with the compound bow purchase, more
microdonations arrive.
    2)d.  The microdonations are interpreted by the system as part of a
very long address created for the transaction.  Due to the tiny price
of the gum the microtransactions are held until another larger
purchase is completed.  The microtransactions occur "times 2" at the
time of the compound bow purchase, since they could not be completed
during the gum purchase, they are completed / confirmed at the time of
the compound bow purchase.  The user is alerted that the ordinary
microdonations will be multiplied by two for the transaction and is
offered an option to either run the default microdonation or the
micronation "times two."  The user confirms the "times two" option and
the microdonations are completed.
    2)e.  The microdonations are each handled as seperate microdonations -
each has a distinct transaction
    2)f.  A fee is collected for some microdonations but not for others
depending upon their size of the microdonation and other factors
    2)g.  Microtransactions are conducted over mobile with zero fees, the
fees are applied only to the item purchased, unless the value of the
microdonations is at a certain threshold value where fees will apply.
    2)h.  The user has the microdonations set by default in the user's
bitcoin client, but also uses 'donation services' (that operate
through a website) apart from the user's client, for example, flattr,
which can provide small bitcoin donations to persons or entities that
the user selects without having to also commit to the "microdonation
default" (Sean's outpost, the cousin, etc) when that 'donation
service' is used.  In other words, the user can commit to a
transaction for the purpose of donation to some person or entity, with
the option of not having the default microdonations occur (user's
option) for that transaction.
(I could go on with all sorts of scenarios here but I think those will
suffice to describe _some_ possibilities)
"Possibilities - continued"
3) The system uses the microdonation process to limit possibility of a 50%
+ 1 attack.  At the user's option, microdonations are routed to different
pools when certain thresholds are reached, to decentralize mining.  This
would occur either as distinct microtransaction (materially, no different
than the microdonation to Sean's Outpost that the user has set as a
default for every purchase) or would occur as part of a "very long
1) What are (some) obstacles to this sort of suggestion to decentralize
the giving process?
2) Would donations be identified as donations or just as another
transaction in the Bitcoin network?  Maybe there is another question
flowing from this question:
  2)a.  Where the user wants the ability to decide to make a donation
'anonymously' or not, could this occur as a default setting for either
one (or all) of the microdonations that the user has set?
3) What would be the simplest possible form of a prototype implementation?

          -----this message is in reply to the below-------
You can always just extend the payment protocol with the new fields as
well, vs making very long addresses. If this technique can be made to work
well, it would have applicability in both fixed textual address context,
and for a fixed/upload-once payment protocol file. That has the advantage
of backwards compatibility as well - the new addresses would not be
clickable or acceptable by old wallets, but with the payment protocol you
can always craft a bitcoin URI that contains a regular current style
address, and a link to a fixed payment protocol file (uploaded to a
pastebin type site), and modern wallets would ignore the address and use
the ECDH based system instead.

Wait, I thought SOCKS4 was supposed to help somehow in terms of prevention
of leaking of information?
Or maybe I am misremembering.  Here's what I'm thinking of...
1) 2) More regarding TOR,
I keep seeing these warnings about SOCKS and DNS information leaks. Should
I worry?
The warning is:
Your application (using socks5 on port %d) is giving Tor only an IP
address. Applications that do DNS resolves themselves may leak
information. Consider using Socks4A (e.g. via Polipo or socat) instead.
I'm not sure that means I'm screaming fire or anything, but isn't there
some good reason for SOCKS4 and SOCKS4A?
Or maybe another way to ask this is:  Looking at an example in which
someone is running Tor, Privoxy, I2P, and FoxyProxy together while running
Bitcoin Core, would there be a problem with having a setting for SOCKS4A
for traffic in such a setup given the changes proposed to remove SOCKS4 as
suggested in bitcoin-development?
Probably there is just a simple answer to that last question, like "no."
But I thought I'd ask.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Incentivizing the running of full nodes 
I have been noticing for some time the problem which Mike H. identified as
how we are bleeding nodes ~ losing nodes over time.
This link was referenced in the coindesk article of May 9, 2014:
(coindesk article for reference: The proposed solution is noted here as a portion of an issue at:
 Essentially that part which has to do with helping reduce
the loss of nodes is as follows:
"a feature similar to that suggested by  that would process small
change and tiny txouts to user specified donation targets, in an
incentivized process. Those running full nodes (Bitcoin Core all the
time), processing their change and txouts through Core, would be provided
incentives in the form of a 'decentralizing lottery' such that all
participants who are running nodes and donating no matter how infrequently
(and no matter who they donate to) will be entered in the 'decentralizing
lottery,' the 'award amounts' (which would be distinct from 'block
rewards' for any mining) would vary from small to large bitcoin amounts
depending on how many participants are involved in the donations process.
This would help incentivize individuals to run full nodes as well as
encouraging giving and microdonations. The option could be expressed in
the transactions area to contribute to help bitcoin core development for
those that are setting up change and txouts for donations, regarding the
microdonation portion (which has also has been expressed conceptually at
This addresses the issue of how to incentivize more
interested individuals to run full nodes (Bitcoin Core).  The lottery
concept (which would be applicable to anyone running the full node
regardless of whether or not they are mining) is attractive from the point
of view that it will complement the block reward concept already in place
which serves those who mine, but more attractive to the individual who
doesn't feel the urge to mine, but would like to have the chance of being
compensated for the effort they put into the system.
I hope that this leads to additional development discussion on these
concepts regarding incentivizing giving. This may also involve a process
BIP.  I look forward to your remarks.

@_author: Odinn Cyberguerrilla 
@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Incentivizing the running of full nodes 
If the technical development emanating from the proposal follows a design
which ensures that the notion of whether or not someone were to donate
remains voluntary in nature (there's never any requirement that someone
donate to anyone, but incentives can be made), then I don't feel that
network split would be an issue, because it's just an issue of choice.
Justus Ranvier suggested a system which would naturally include
pay-to-play networks, and not just free P2P networks.  The question of how
to limit the number of entries the system registers in the framework of
the proposed 'decentralizing lottery' would be fairly straightforward,
there could one entry for a distinct period of time (say 30 days as an
example) for anyone who meets the suggested criteria of:
 "those running full nodes (Bitcoin Core (...)), processing their
  change and txouts through Core, would be provided incentives in the form
  of a 'decentralizing lottery' such that all participants who are running
  nodes and donating no matter how infrequently (and no matter who they
  donate to) will be entered in the 'decentralizing lottery,'" for a
  chance to receive "the 'award amounts'"
In my mind I imagine that the smart property qualities of Bitcoin may
eventually enable people to represent what sort of time and energy they
are putting into maintaining the network, so that rather solely a currency
aspect, people who have done something collaborative with each other to
help advance or develop Bitcoin would be able to show in their donations
field that they have a smart property, which could be also expressed in
equivalence terms as a value of a certain amount of btc, would also be
able to have the smart property representing their voluntary efforts
represented and given a voice in the blockchain, whether or not they want
to participate in such a 'decentralizing lottery.'  In point of fact, I
contemplate that all aspects of this, at least ideally (to me) should be
voluntary, such that if a person is donating through this system, that is
voluntary, if they wish to have their donations result in a chance at
winning the 'decentralizing lottery,' that is voluntary / an option, and
if they win, they would have the option to accept the winnings or return
them (the bitcoin 'award amount') back to the network.
Those who are already dedicated to running nodes will likely (mostly)
remain, but any ideas reaching technical development and reality as a
result of this concept would be intended to help grow that base by
bringing in persons who might not otherwise be as interested to do so.
That's a great idea.  The incentives could certainly go beyond just
pointing to Bitcoin Core.  Giving is important to everyone.

@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Bitcoin for W3C Payments Workshop, 
I wish to state that I fundamentally disagree with this proposal of use
cases for W3C payments workshop.  Please read my following explanation and
then do what you will:
At one time I was invited to join the Web Payments conference calls.  I
considered it and then declined due to the very CLAs that Brent mentioned
in the message that started this thread.
I was trying to remember the language that I objected to relating to the
W3C CLA.  Found it:  As mentioned, I was
offered to join these calls but I declined due to, in part, the following:
Upon review of  the page at  web-payments.org, I noticed that it provides
a means to connect with web payments group by teleconference.  However,
there is an agreement that the site would require me to accept merely to
join the teleconference and collaborate with others in the web payments
group.  I would say "unfortunately," but in my case I will say
fortunately, I don't agree with the required agreement as shown here at
 which is shown as
follows at  "There are no costs
associated with joining the group or limitations on who may join the
teleconference as long as they agree to the Web Payments community "
Some of the things I don't like about the proposed agreement /
"requirement" are fundamental.  At the core, it should be understood that
collaborative efforts, or teleconferences involving innovators who strive
to develop concepts for eventual development of a social good, for
example, should not be subject to a "requirement" that anyone agree to a
license in relation to their participation or contribution.  Such
"requirements" inhibit innovation and free thought.  For example, the web
payments group provides that in order for me to participate, I must first
"agree to license my Essential Claims under the W3C CLA RF Licensing
Requirements" and numerous other requirements.
Although I was interested in some sort of collaboration with the Web
Payments Community Group, these CLAs - lengthy, burdensome, and in my
personal view, highly dubious and potentially restricting with respect to
innovation and free thought - caused me to reconsider, and thus I will not
be entering into web or telephone conferences or related collaborations
with the W3C / Web Payments folks until such time as they remove these
burdensome requirements which are applied merely to join a call.?

I look at this and agree of course that the nodes are decreasing, see,
   But when I see stuff in the white paper
like "misbehaving nodes" in the context of an "audit agent," a "single
non-forking blockchain," the notion of "Misbehaving nodes" that would be
"banned from the network" so as to "motivat(e) honest behavior," ~ really,
all of this does sound as though a sort of morality is being formulated
rather than a mathematical solution.
This is not to say that the white paper hasn't addressed a problem that
needs to be addressed, namely... the problem of the nodes disappearing,
and a few other things.  But to take that and then layer onto that the
issues associated with proof of stake... There does seem to be a simpler
way to address this and I think first without suggesting the complex issue
of some kind of thing that would involve dividends for those in a
proof-of-stake system, consensus achieved by stake-weighted voting, and so
forth, one would be better off removing all references to voting and
stake, and determining ways simply to incentivize more substantively those
who actually run a full node.  Additionally I am hesitant to characterize
behavior as has been described in the white paper, as it would seem that
(in such a system) there would be an inclination or a tendency to exclude
certain patterns or groups of participants rather than determine ways in
which all participants or potential peers can serve the network.

Cameron Garnham's dynamic block size adjustment (needing soft fork
only)) in a BIP.
It is also worthwhile to add that some of the softforking proposals,
and I believe Garnham's to be one of them, are not incompatible with
proposals such as Jeff Garzik's BIP 100, that is to say, there is
nothing keeping you from doing the Garnham dynamic block size

Hash: SHA1
Jim, some good points... People are rightly concerned about any given
regional or nation-state's dominance in mining, but China has
certainly become more of a subject of concern as of late, and not
simply because it is a communist country and because its economy is
highly centralized and state-run, but rather, because of the advent of
newly proposed or adopted laws (not unlike those which we see being
proposed in the UK or those recently adopted in France, so that no-one
may say I am unfairly targeting China).  Further, the recent shots off
the bow between the USA and China in the latest crypto-wars saga
(whether bluster or ultimately not) mean that we should be seriously
concerned about too much mining happening in one specific region; thus
there shouldn't be too much incentive for that to happen, yet at the
time being (as you've rightly pointed out) the subsidization of
electricity there, combined with the availability of certain
environmental conditions for cooling and / or hydropower, means that
China dominates the mining realm.
Recently I took the time to ask someone associated with a new bitcoin
mining operation in China some questions about the new (apparently
developing) National Security Law of China.
According to an early draft of this National Security Law, "the State
maintains the basic economic system and order of the socialist
marketplace ... safeguarding security in important industries and
fields that influence the populace's economic livelihood ... as well
as other major economic interests."
The Chinese government is currently reviewing another national
security related law, which in its first draft would mandate ALL
Internet companies operating in China to provide backdoor access and
encryption keys to the government.  (One would imagine that would
include any exchanges and mining operations as well.)
The US FBI Director (Comey) has also, of course, made plenty of
arguments for backdoors in encryption.  But as security expert Bruce
Schneier points out, there "really is no way" to keep users' data safe
while providing backdoors. He said:
    "I have two options. I can design a secure system that has no
backdoor access, meaning neither criminals nor foreign intelligence
agencies nor domestic police can get at the data. Or I can design a
system that has backdoor access, meaning they all can."
Anyway, the response of the individual (eric at haobtc - of haobtc.com)
to my questions can be seen here:
His responses were provided to me before the recent "Crypto Wars"
announcements which I think will only think make things worse:
So, I try to be optimistic, but I'm leaning pessimistic right now
about the situation with the effect of the Crypto Wars combined with
the dominance of Chinese mining plus China's development of new laws
that seem to involve further attempts to backdoor hardware and / or
software.  Obviously this doesn't break bitcoin for mathematical
reasons that everyone on this list is already familiar with I'm sure,
but it is concerning to me, and now I will /endrant

Hash: SHA1
If I understand this correctly, Lightning only requires transaction
malleability to be fixed to be able to work ~ I believe that was going
to happen in a release of (bitcoind), but I'm not sure if that is
correct on timing ( note also, this wiki seems to be out of date on
infos about bitcoind  )
I have also heard it said that bitcoin should support relative
locktime opcodes so that long-lived micropayment channels would be
able to be created, such that there would be Lightning functionality
beyond the basic microhop channels (which would be short-lived in
nature at the basic level).
This would be nice, but it seems like such discussions would take a
while to get done as basic development issues right now aren't even
wrapping up (e.g. blocksize debate related stuff.)  Note that I've
been in favor of going ahead with Cameron Garnham's dynamic softfork
proposal right now, which can be seen at  - testing
it out, seeing how that works, and at the same time making
preparations for moving forward with Garzik's BIP 100 (which could be
tailored or refined based on additional data gathered, without being
turned into a controversial fork (e.g. needs to make sure to avoid
inclusion of XT, for example).  Garnham's proposal and Garzik's
proposal are not mutually exclusive, imho, and I don't see why the
matter can't simply be resolved, it seems to be just an endless pile
of argumentation that will go on forever and ever.  This needs to,
like, stop.
Also, it strikes me that unless and until certain changes can be made
in bitcoin that would reduce fees and cost to transact, solutions such
as Lightning are going to fill the gap whether or not you want them
to; users have a choice in the market, and as the billions of unbanked
are gradually excluded from straight bitcoin, people will seek other
services which offer them lesser fees to transact, or they will seek
other coins which offer them lesser cost to transact.  It is, after
all, an open market.  I have made this point before elsewhere albeit
with more emphasis (and data to back up my point):
( On Github at Pull Request   )
In making and successfully defending such points on Github, the
following conclusions were drawn:
As the cost to transact goes higher and higher based on this
observable trend (due to all the factors mentioned in the thread on
github), then people who are affected by these rising costs to
transact will do one of three things with respect to bitcoin (and
virtual currencies generally):
1) Ignore bitcoin (an unlikely possibility, but it is one that would
2) adopt alts which are more inclined to allow people to perform
3) and/or use bitcoin increasingly off-chain, which is likely to come
with its own set of problems for the network.
Regarding donation or microdonation use cases, To keep it all
on-chain, wallets can be designed to accumulate donation micro-amounts
according to donation settings of a user (in voluntary donation use
cases such as in ABIS --  ) as an internal accounting
feature, for example, and when enough donation value is accumulated,
it can be sent to the recipient by piggybacking on one of the user's
daily transactions.  This is one method doing so in a manner which is
on-chain; depending on the cryptocurrency under consideration, the
feasibility of doing this in a wallet will be greater or lesser.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Fees and the block-finding process 
Hash: SHA1
Hello, I thought these were good points, but I have a couple questions..
Bitcoin (as well as the internet, and the world wide web) is already
regulated around the world.
There used to be a map that documented this fairly well, called
bitlegal (bitlegal.net) but the site is now parked or offline.  There
is an alternative visual picture of the subject at:
The upshot of that is that web wallets (which are popularized due to
convenience) cannot be considered to provide users with control over
their money - extended discussion on this here in the bitcoin.org
My question, therefore is this:
When you say "it will be pressured into regulation, eventually," what
do you mean? Are you implying that even the hardware wallets and
desktop wallets for bitcoin will be regulated to the point where they
cannot be used by individuals who actually care about being able to
circumvent financial censorship?  If so, explain how that is the case.
 I could see an argument where that might be the case to some degree
if you would mention it in the context of services like Chainalysis
and other companies that are in the process of setting up services for
corporation-states for "virtual currency compliance;" e.g.; if
activity can be scanned and if a state has a requirement you are
supposed to be registered with the state to use virtual currency at
some level, and if companies scan the blockchain and report this
information to states (as they now do), then as you say, the only
reasonable method of using virtual currencies would be one in which
location is masked and information about the nodes and history of
transactions can be hidden.  However, this requires more privacy and
anonymity effort in bitcoin development, but I don't think it would
actually keep people from using hardware and desktop wallets (although
I do think eventually people will, as they are beginning to now, be
gradually censored more and more from utilizing web wallets for
activities that they desire).
It seems to me that the existence of various tools and conditions
(external to the whole issue of legal constraints) are also very
important.  For example, various companies have recently made public
announcements that they will leave (or not operate in) New York due to
Bitlicense - Kraken, Shapeshift.io, poloniex, and others.  It's
understandable given the extreme nature of NY's approach (I personally
oppose any regulation of virtual currencies).  But technically, they
didn't have to cease operating, did they?  This was a failure in their
business model.  They made a big statement about how evil NY was and
fled the scene, perhaps never to return to serve NY.  (Note, I don't
live in NY, so I'm not personally being left out in the cold when
Kraken etc. leave, for the record.) As said, this was a failure in
Kraken, poloniex's, shapeshift's, etc., business model.  Why?  Because
here we are talking about web-based services.  A distributed,
decentralized, peer-to-peer model in which the user has a piece of
software on their computer (think openbazaar or bitsquare) is far and
away better than services which are web based.  Why?  Because systems
which are set up such as (openbazaar, bitsquare) don't have to worry
about the constraints of state boundaries or shifting legal things,
nor do the people who made the software end up holding keys on behalf
of the users.  If Kraken, poloniex, etc., had bothered to develop
contingency software (similar to what is being worked on with
 for example) for users who might be affected in
jurisdictions where corporation-states Just Don't Get It (read... NY,
and possibly CA, as examples) then maybe they wouldn't have to worry
about it at all.  It just would be a matter of users installing a
piece of software from their website, discontinuing the web-based
exchange for that state, and directing users for highly regulated
states to a download page for the decentralized exchange software.
Not that hard really - but something we haven't seen done yet by the
big exchanges.
I have another question for you below...
Why do you say 8GB / block would destroy the very nature of Bitcoin?
I don't see that it would destroy bitcoin... but also, what would
cause 8GB to happen very soon?  As I understood it, any process would
phase increases.  Explain how that would destroy the very nature of
Blocksize is extremely likely to get bigger (I'm supposing here that
some version of Garzik's BIP 100 or something very close to it is what
will likely be adopted and that the blocksize would be voted on

The "XT Fork" (better said, a POS alt*) and those behind it make not
even a pretense to work through process involved with bitcoin developmen
(*This is not intended as a slight toward any other alts, as here in
this post I am focusing solely on XT.)
Instead of abandoning their useless project, or at least conceding
that their alt is operating essentially outside of the development
funnel (by this I mean BIP process), the developers of XT, via their
latest presentation of XT give nothing more than an attack on bitcoin
(albeit one that, more than anything, is designed to sidetrack real
discussion necessary to resolve the issues so as to achieve some level
of consensus in block size debates).  Curiously, XT is not even truly
the implementation of BIP 101; the actual proposed implementation of
BIP 101 as proposed at
is found here: (It is currently a closed issue.)
It's probably valid to call into question why Mike Hearn in particular
persists with this project at all, as he has been its biggest
cheerleader. Some reasons may be:
1) His interest in attacking bitcoin in the past (seems to be a
recurring pattern)
2) His employment (has come up before) - QinetiQ, Google, etc
 - it's simply not
unreasonable to ask why he's pushing it so hard when nobody wants it.
3) Various reasons mentioned here:
4) His disinterest in following what is actually happening with votes
on legitimate proposals (e.g. Garzik's BIP 100) in the blocks. (Caveat
~ one doesn't see the BIP 100 yet in bitcoin/bips because it won't
appear for another couple weeks, supposedly.  The miners' voting is
already happening however.) Even according to  we
see that XT runs minimal nodes in comparison to the rest of nodes
being run across the network.
BIP 100 itself is anticipated to be submitted w/ implementation in the
next 2 weeks and many miners are already voting on BIP 100 (as per
Jeff Garzik, from a post 08/12/2015 12:46 PM -0400 to this mailing list)
 It is an insult to see Hearn fling the XT turd into the community
How then to end this XT madness?

I don't think the XT author(s) are going to do what you are
describing.  Their recent release, at
doesn't show any sign of moving toward a version which would be
"increasing consensus." Instead, they ignore any meaningful process
and, as I have recently indicated, have created somthing which
"sidetrack(s) real discussion necessary to resolve the issues so as to
achieve some level of consensus in block size debates."
That doesn't rule out that the BIP authors can't work together and
create something meaningful and useful, though.  As I stated before,
"In my past message(s), I've suggested that Jeff's BIP 100
is a better alternative to Gavin's proposal(s), but that I didn't

This originally was formulated in alerts via discussion on bitcoin.org

So anyway.
Getting back to this, how do I ensure that I have a safe version?
Thus far I am still using the guidance here from the bitcoin.org alert

users to wait 30 confirmations more than usual, but also directs users
to the following resource:
This brings me to the "safe software and version."  If we understand
this correctly, the safe software and version will be Bitcoin Core at
its most current version.  Thus it is vitally important to provide a
way to ensure that users do not inadvertently be misled into
connecting to a XT node.
However, the information (about the software and version, in banner)
is provided voluntarily by the server administrators and thus isn't
validated.  How to make sure that you are actually connecting to one
who is running Core with the proper version (and not Core with some
very old version, or XT)?
On the bitcoin wiki, it states in part,
"During a fork, it is possible to use the Get Block Header custom
plugin[3] to authoritatively determine which side of the fork an
Electrum server is on."  It refers to this:
Depending on what wallet people are using, that is, Core, any of the
other wallets... hardware, desktop, web, mobile... there would be
different ways to determine what software is being used to make sure
that you are using Core in the current version (and not inadvertently
using XT for example).  The question is, how would this be done most

able to pull off what you are describing.  If people don't want XT it

A visualization I would like to see would include:
pie graph(s) of what % are voting for (BIP 100, BIP 101, 8MB, BIP sipa

Bitcoin will be neutered and die if the big Chinese mining pools
utilize XT.
Specifically the text of  tweet was,
"I support increasing the block size.  's AntPool will be
prepared to switch to XT, IF we see majority has switched."
Since there are many people who are supportive of increasing the block
size, but have spend much time calling attention to the many problems
of XT (which I need not repeat again here), it is odd that Jihan Wu
would see a need to suggest that AntPool will be prepared to switch to
XT at a time when there has not yet been time for fully assessing
other proposals; not all proposals have gone through a voting process,
nor have even people had a chance yet to attend upcoming workshops on
the subject which are partially or wholly intended for development of
consensus ( one example being the upcoming one in Montreal, but I
think this is not the only one See also Pindar Wong's post on this list regarding the Montreal workshop
This is also a good time to remember again some of the pressures being
placed by the state on Chinese internet-based businesses.  These
pressures have increased, as has been recently discussed on this list,
Take a good read of these issues (linked to above) relating to Chinese
mining and the influence of the Chinese state, and it becomes clear
how the state pressures might cause Chinese miners to adopt XT in
light of:
Hearn's disabling Tor in XT
Hearn's move to support blacklisting
A recent post that sums it up pretty well:
I encourage people still reading this list to:
- - Not use XT
- - Work to develop consensus on an alternative that increases block
size (e.g. BIP 100)
- - Attend a conference if you can such as the one which is coming up in
Montreal  and if you go there
as a developer / engineer / miner, AGREE ON SOMETHING (other than XT)
- - Visualize different proposals and votes on them so people can see
what is happening

Hash: SHA512
Um ~ "jurisdiction of wallet provider?"
If that's the (perhaps ot) bit you want to run on this thread then my
comments are:
Get out of web wallet businesses now.  It's not a jurisdictional
question anymore, although I think there used to be very valid long
running debates on where it would be best to do business.  Now it just
feels like you will be bouncing from one place to another -
determining where your exit is as soon as you establish a (physical)
presence, because jurisdictions sense a serious threat from the
advancement of financial cryptography as it will evolve in the next
several years. So you have to be mobile, or do something like what
they are establishing at blueseed (see  which is
just off coast of San Francisco).  Please perk up and don't just swipe
to delete, read the whole e-mail.  There are some configurations (e.g.
the zero knowledge bit) you can do to mitigate the issues but if you
are asking users to log in and log out of a service that relies on a
web site then in the end you doom them (and any service you provide)
to mandatory storage of customer data and ultimately loss of customer
resources due to identification of the customer.
I think you need to stop quibbling about the details and just get over
it and understand that the problem of web wallet users and
corporations that serve web wallet customers being forced to give up
information constantly to governments means that web wallets are
certainly no longer a viable solution.  And post-cromnibus with the
extra financial surveillance provisions now passed on 3rd party
matters, it's even worse.  This is not subject to debate, it's just a
fact.  Period.  Web wallet corps exist now only on a model that exists
to burn the users.  Convenient?  Yes.  But is it good for the users in
the long haul?  Absolutely not.  Do alternative to the web wallets
exist? Absolutely.
Back off.. Go to p2p.  Stop advocating for webby solutions.  In fact,
I don't think that anyone working for coinbase or bitpay should be,
anymore.  I think that on principle you should withdraw and end your
employment from such services.
Core?  Good.  Electrum Wallet?  good.  Mycelium? Local Trader? Open
Bazaar?  Could be better, but great.  These are the kind of things we
need.  No signups, avoids centralizations, no grabbing your data, no
ID collection and requirements.
As to the issue of auto-updating itself... I think the simplest answer
to this question (personally) is that (go ahead and attack me here)
there shouldn't be auto-updates... but that there should be
auto-notifications for update when (a) update is available, but that
(b) this notification should never "push" the user to update (e.g. the
notification should never say "oh hey user if you don't update by such
and such a date, your wallet will not work or satoshis will die
because of your inaction"
(stays quiet while likely 100-e-mail thread is spawned from this)

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Do we really need a mempool? (for relay nodes) 
Hash: SHA1
Some brief thoughts, adding here a suggestion for a dynamic approach
to the issue. (e.g. each additional tx relayed has some thing
associated with it, that is, a "doubling" for each additional tx
relayed that spends a given UTXO, doesn't sound like it would be the
most dynamic approach to the issue; considering that full nodes use
the (UTXOs) to establish if transactions are valid ? all inputs to a
transaction must be in the UTXO database for it to be valid, but
rather, would end up ratcheting upward the fee/kB for each additional
tx relayed, as proposed).
A more dynamic fee approach would be a better one, imho, but how is
this to occur?
Quoting from Gavin Andresen's "The entire UTXO set doesn?t have to be in RAM; it can be stored on an
SSD or spinning hard disk. The access pattern to the UTXO is not
random; outputs that were spent recently are more likely to be
re-spent than outputs that have not been spent in a long time. Bitcoin
Core already has a multi-level UTXO cache, thanks to the hard work of
Pieter Wuille."
The relay nodes would, in this scenario that is proposed here in this
message, be confirming and discarding; the wallet nodes, if I
understand properly, in this scenario, as proposed, should be
retaining (keeping a record of the transactions they've relayed and
using a mempool).
There are some questions here:
- - How is the mempool to be limited?
- - What is the mechanism by which the UTXO set is stored (or proposed
to be stored)?
- - How would dynamic fee determinations be calculated?
- - Please describe more the general purpose messaging network?

Note that I am not Gregory, so with that caveat...
No, it will have multiple and diverse purposes into which it can be
used for and can evolve, it would not be sufficient to state that it
has "a future" merely as a high-value settlement network.
If you have a proposal on this, please submit it in the formal way as
a BIP draft.   Enough time has been burnt on the subject, imho.
It is the market.  What will happen will happen.  If bitcoin
development pushes fees upward as an overall trend and the overall
cost to transact continues to increase, billions of people around the
world will as a result be forced out from most use cases of bitcoin
and the "bleeding out" will occur naturally to alts (to the extent
that persons already possessed bitcoin first and need to transact).
As stated above, liquidity moves to location of least friction.
Bitcoin bagholders can whine all they want, but value will distribute
into the alts gradually.
"allow" is not a relevant term here, as it is not up to anyone what
people are going to do with their crypto of any kind.  Unless, of
course, you are fool enough to be using Coinbase and Bitpay or
something like that.  They own "your" coin, and they will decide, or
allow, what you do with it or whether you can even access it.
As has been stated before here, I hope you are not using such services.

Hash: SHA1
Great summary, thanks.  Helpful to get general grasp of the main
things out there.
I'd like to add to this some remarks that are from an earlier discussion
Cameron Garnham added into a thread, at
"First off, I am glad that the idea of dynamic block size adjustment is
gaining some attention, in particular the model that I proposed.
I wanted to take some time and explain some of the philosophy of how,
and why, I proposed this this particular model.
When Bitcoin was first made, there was a 32MB block size limit; this
was quickly found to be open to spam (and potentially DOS, as the code
was not-at-all optimized to support large blocks), and was reduced to
1MB, this was a quick fix that was never intended to last; at some
point the network should come to an understanding, a consensus if you
will, of what (and how much) belongs in a block.
The core point of this is that miners have always, and will always;
hold the power, to decide what goes into blocks; this implicitly,
obviously, includes how large blocks are. Miners are able to come any
sort of agreement they wish, providing the bitcoin clients accept
their blocks as valid."
"the proposal introducing a consensus protocol for block sizes;
instead of just having a hard limit (enforced by everyone), instead,
we have a constant factor above the average block size over a fixed
intervals that is soft-forked by only the miners. (The next simplest
mathematical construct).
This proposal is entirely a soft-fork and may be implemented without
changing any client code what so ever. In-fact, it could be
implemented by only a simple 51% majority of miners, with-or-without
gaining the wider community consensus."

I agree that changes of anything more than trivial are difficult, but
I would disagree that they can't be made.  It seems that the issue is
one of roadblocks and muddling through when a major issue (e.g. the
proposal of a hardfork / XT) is confronting the community and the
question of how to address this issue in a timely manner. That does
not mean that there isn't a process for the community to weigh in or
for the decisions of the participants in the network to be measured
because, of course, there is, but I submit that the larger issues are
having to do with concerns over the problems inherent in the totally
unnecessary XT proposal itself.
My own thoughts on that proposal are written up at
And have been supported somewhat by various others in the community,
such as GreenAddress (which is opposed at this time to increasing the
blocksize limit as per Gavin's proposal) and Adam Back:
I think Jeff Garzik had some good thoughts specifically regarding this
subject of user vote in blocksize through fees.  Although I do agree

to crack, I won't say that they can't be made in such processes and I

I also disagree with the notion that everybody's just ok with what
Mike and Gavin are doing.... specifically, this statement by Mike
was kind of twisting things, because it made it sound like everybody
supports Gavin's proposal to hard fork to XT, which these folks don't.
2) This isn't to say they don't want to see a limit adjusted but not in
the way that Gavin (and you, Mike) are proposing - not through this
hard fork to XT.
So go roll out your code for whatever it is you are going to put into
XT and make a BIP, but stop saying that everyone supports it when
obviously they don't and you don't even have something yet and there
are already superior alternatives that don't involve Gavin's hard fork

Huobi's mining project Digcoin, clarified that the big Chinese mining
pools consider further adjustments to the protocol beyond the
suggested 8 MB block size limit adjustment ? such as the Bitcoin core
developer Jeff Garzik's BIP-100 draft ? to be feasible)
   ~ Adam Back, with a simplified soft-fork one-way peg
   ~ Gavin Andresen, developing an 8 MB block size limit adjustment in
the context of Core (as an example) with one or more of the above
authors rather than focusing on XT. (This is a big assumption but,
roll with it)
All of this assumes that developer(s) are willing to abandon
intentionally contentious proposals such as the "hard fork to XT w/ 20
MB," remain within the context of Core and be reasonable.

happening, address it squarely, have the person who is threatening
others explain his/her behavior, deal with the problem and move on.
This seems to be very important.  Please tell me if I am wrong about
this or totally flawed in my perspective here.  Go right ahead.
In this video, a particular developer makes the following statement,
stating in part:
"My preferred solution is that Gavin revokes commit access from
everyone else in the project, and then... makes the change himself"
Regardless of how you look at this, and even if we believe that Gavin
will not respond to that developer's request for a so-called
"solution," such a statement (by any developer) is indeed both a
threat and an act of sabotage against the larger bitcoin community.
We should certainly be thankful therefore, for the recent policy
change at bitcoin.org which can be seen here:
I firmly believe that any developer who made a statement suggesting
that commit access of others in the project be revoked so that they
can proceed with their personal plan, needs to answer for having made
such a suggestion with a formal apology to this list, followed by an
explanation for why they themselves should not have their commit
access removed.
Overall, however, this sort of bombastic, nuclear suggestion makes me
seriously concerned for the future of bitcoin (as well as any
cryptocurrency which has repositories on Github).
So, you know who you are:  Apologize for your statement ("preferred
solution") and explain to the community why you should still have
commit access in light of the threat you have made to all the other
developers (and indeed to all participants of the bitcoin community).
 These "nuclear options" are unacceptable to us all.

I maintain that you should apologize to those who traverse this list.
 What you are saying is digging yourself a deeper hole and is not
merely embarrassing but is crossing a threshold in which you have used
words, albeit subtly, to attack a community.
If you refuse to apologize, I get it.  You have not apologized thus
far, and pressing for an apology is unlikely to get an (authentic)
one.  But then, you should voluntarily step back and let others do the
hard work of coming to the consensus that you seem to think is
impossible to accomplish based on how bitcoin is run.
I believe this matter will be resolved, but not with the "help" of
those who make threatening statements (and who are unable to apologize
for having made them).

Regarding this proposal from Mike Hearn to remove consensus process
from the BIP, which I think is unsound philosophy.  I will address
this briefly below.
For many things, that will simply be too fast. It is better to allow
the primary maintainer to collaborate with other people who normally
work on the code and determine what the schedule will be based on
life, volume of work, and so on.
Again, this three week thing doesn't work.  But assume for a moment
that there is a certain amount of time that is such and so and it is
set by the maintainer.  The notion that the maintainer would be
"required" to request an extension from the BIP author is sheer
lunacy.  There is no need to codify the actions of the project
maintainer such that he/she would be needing to be subject to the
whims of whatever BIP author.  In like manner, a BIP author should not
have to be subject to forever delay of a BIP due to inaction of a
maintainer, but should have an answer regarding whether it can be
assigned a number, published as draft and so forth after a reasonable
time.  To me, a "reasonable time" is something that should be
discussed amongst the maintainer, those who work regularly on code,
and the BIP author.
No, this is ridiculous, because the notion that "no BIP will be
rejected on grounds of controversy, disagreement, lack of consensus,
or otherwise," is clearly an attempt to do away with consensus models
of business, and it is also not a very logical statement because
controversy and disagreement are a natural part of... coming to what
eventually is an agreement.
This above section I agree with.
 In case the maintainer believes no change could ever make
This above section I do not agree with because of the obvious bias in
favor of the hard fork.  Everything here seems to be aligned to push
for hard fork, hard fork, hard fork.  It's like the author can't tear
his mind off it.
This doesn't seem right at all.

Regarding the bit on "getting out in front of the need, to prevent
significant negative impacts to users" I had suggested the following:
My thoughts on that:
Possible scope narrowing to one of the following concepts (but please,
someone tell me if this "scope narrowing" is unwise, not timely, or if
there is some other factors that would make it just stupid right now
because other things are in the works or whatever:
~ Jeff Garzik, with respect to his BIP 100 (note Evan Mo, CEO of
Huobi's mining project Digcoin, clarified that the big Chinese mining
pools consider further adjustments to the protocol beyond the
suggested 8 MB block size limit adjustment ? such as the Bitcoin core
developer Jeff Garzik's BIP-100 draft ? to be feasible)
   ~ Adam Back, with a simplified soft-fork one-way peg
   ~ Gavin Andresen, developing an 8 MB block size limit adjustment in
the context of Core (as an example) with one or more of the above
authors rather than focusing on XT. (This is a big assumption but,
roll with it)
All of this assumes that developer(s) are willing to abandon
intentionally contentious proposals such as the "hard fork to XT w/ 20
MB," remain within the context of Core and be reasonable.
Here I am being aware of the fact that "Pushing a hard fork in the
face of such controversy is a folly, a danger to the network, and that
deserves to be said." - Wladimir J. van der Laan
Something else I wanted to point out here in this thread is the
subject of the problem of "developers going off the deep end" which is
what started this thread:
Suppose you have a developer with full commit access who happens to
start threatening to revoking the other developers' commit access on
the repository, or that person doesn't even threaten, one day it just
What do you have then?  Peter Todd has stated that all one "would
achieve by that sabotage is setting a key-value pair in a centralised
registry."  But is that what we want?
The answer, obviously, is no.
This leads to other questions. What technical mechanisms exist to keep
developers from (in some dubious emotional or psycho state) to just
going off the deep and doing exactly what has been described above, if
they have full commit access?  Is there a process whereby that can't
actually happen unless another developer provides a signature (e.g. a
multisignature type of process)?  What keeps bitcoin safe from "The
Hearn Threat?"
If nothing does, then how would you change that?
And go ahead and tell me if these are dumb questions and I should just
be quiet, but if they are, please do explain why they are such dumb

You did address that, to be fair - in your TODO, this link:

However, in reading that, I didn't see any meaningful statements that
would refute the approach in Garzik's BIP-100.
Maybe a better way to say this is,

discussions in private) as well as the list discussions,
Move forward on BIP-100 with Garzik and other developers (not such a
bad plan really) and don't get caught up in XT.  (If you feel you can
develop XT further, that is your thing but it would perhaps make you
lose focus, work together with other developers.)

If you (e.g. Chainalysis) or anyone else are doing surveillance on the
network and gathering information for later use, and whether or not
the ultimate purpose is to divulge it to other parties for compliance
purposes, you can bet that ultimately the tables will be turned on
you, and you will be the one having your ass handed to you so to
speak, before or after you are served, in legal parlance.  Whether or
not the outcome of that is meaningful and beneficial to any concerned
parties and what is the upshot of it in the end depends on on what you
do and just how far you decide to take your ill-advised enterprise.
Chainalysis and similar operations would be, IMHO, well advised to
cease operations.  This doesn't mean they will, but guess what:
Shot over the bow, folks.

Back to what is Chainalysis and country of their origin, so criminal
complaints against them would likely relate to violation of Swiss
laws, as is described here:
It is fairly obvious that Chainalysis is not merely doing what
blockchain.info etc. is. Let's not delude ourselves here.
As stated, it would be advisable for such a firm to cease operations,
and it would seem that plenty of polite shots over the bow have been
given to Chainalysis, which should now fold up its operation, pack its
bags, and go back to its hole before trying to serve its masters again
in another way. Etc.
Corporations similar to Chainalysis which are domiciled in other
countries which conduct collection of information in ways that violate
countries' laws (there are many countries and each have their own ways
of interpreting user privacy and what constitutes permissible breach
and in what circumstances) can indeed be held to legal standards that
may result in minimal or severe legal penalties.  It is true that
analyzing information that is publicly available, such as that which
is in a library, is not illegal. But the act of surveillance is.
(Then there is the question of what sort of surveillance, targeted or
general, and whether it is limited to the bitcoin network or if it
moves beyond that to attempts to correlate with usernames, IDs, IPs,
and other information available on fora and apparent from services,
but I won't get into that here.)  Even if you argue that the manner in
which you are performing your actions is not actually "surveillance,"
or you argue that it is "legally permissible," someone else will
certainly come along and make a reasonable argument that you are
indeed engaging in illegal surveillance.  They may even suggest to a
judge that you are in the process of constructing a botnet and demand
that your domains be seized, and may successfully obtain an ex parte
temporary restraining order (TRO) against Chainalysis and similar
corporations to have domain(s) seized.  Any and all arguments may be
added in here, there are 196 countries in the world today - each with
their own unique laws - (maybe less by the time you read this) and a
shit-ton of possible legal arguments that can be made by creative
minds that might want to sue you if you have been surveilling people,
each different depending on where your surveillance corporation is
domiciled.  There are plenty of legal processes available for people
to do exactly that.  You are indeed subject to having that happen to
you if you continue to surveill the network even if you are doing so
on behalf of the state for the purpose of gathering information for a
state's compliance initiative.
So, don't delude yourself, and be happy if all that happens is your
little surveillance initiative has to close its doors (or gets sued if
it stays open).  Because that is the legal side of things.  The
extralegal stuff is far worse.  The community is helping you by asking
you gently to close up shop and go away. It is a helpful suggestion
and I believe also a fair warning, again, a shot off the bow.
On the development side, developers are certainly responsible for
doing what they can to resist this kind of surveillance activity.  But
I have a feeling that will be a different thread which is more
technical and so won't comment on it here, except to say it will
likely involve working toward giving the user an anonymity option
which can be exercised as part of any transaction.

Hash: SHA512
This (Bitcoin-NG in concept) could be done as a (issue and pull
request process) to Bitcoin Core itself, amirite?  It seems like it
would provide an interesting issue to open and have healthy discussion
on both mailing list and github, adding the caveat that it would be at
the user's option.  Thus if something like Bitcoin-NG did come to be
it would be something more like a feature that the user could activate
with the option to utilize.  Code would thus be available to others as
well.  I am not saying yea or nay on it, just that it seems like this
could be done.
Some notes:
Once a node generates a key block it becomes the leader.  As a leader,
the node is allowed to generate  microblocks  at  a  set  rate
smaller  than  a  predened  maximum.  A  microblock in Bitcoin-NG
contains  ledger  entries  and  a  header.   The  header  contains
the  reference  to the  previous  block,  the  current  GMT  time,  a
 cryptographic  hash  of  its  ledger  entries,  and  a cryptographic
 signature  of  the  header.   The  signature  uses  the  private  key
 that  matches  the public key in the latest key block in the chain.
For a microblock to be valid, all its entries must be valid according
to the specification of the state machine, and the signature has to be
valid.  However, the microblocks, it is said, don't affect the weight
of the chain, because they do not contain proof of work.  It is
assumed by the authors of this model that this situation is critical
for maintaining incentives here.
The questions that then begin to emerge to me are how is this
information managed and protected?  The headers, thus containing
reference(s) to previous block(s), current GMT time(s), cryptographic
hash(es) of ledger entries, and cryptographic signature(s) of the
headers, so forth, and other information.  Can the Bitcoin-NG scheme
be designed or implemented in a manner which supports Stealth sends,
Confidential Transactions, or similar privacy measures?  Or is this
something which cannot be answered at this time?

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] Proposed list moderation policy and conduct 
Hash: SHA512
I am concerned that someone will always call "off topic" regardless of
how on-topic something actually is.  There is no objective measure of
on-topicness here (or hasn't been) unless we say it has to do with
bitcoin development.
If you say, "Conversations should remain focused and on-topic," as you
have suggested, then presumably you mean, as has also been suggested
in the proposed list moderation policy and conduct document, that we
"aim to facilitate constructive discussion
of issues related to technical development of the bitcoin protocol and
the Bitcoin Core reference implementation"
and thus, that "on-topic" conversations would necessarily be "related
to technical development of the bitcoin protocol and the Bitcoin Core
reference implementation."
Unfortunately, while that is fairly specific to what this list is
about, I think it still will result in a lot of people shouting "Off
Topic!" whenever someone mentions something that might even be
remotely and slightly off the the range.  Thus, I don't think the
current language in the proposed list moderation policy and conduct
document is really that good, and needs much more discussion and
refinement before, well, anything.  It would be a shame if every time
someone brings up something innovative, new or wonderful, or explores
something on the boundaries, they are shouted down with cries of "Off
Topic!" Which, by the way, I see happening A Lot on this list.
Specifically relating to the subject of Disclosure,
It is suggested that people here
"*Disclose potential conflicts*"
"1. List discussions often involve interested parties. We expect
participants to be aware when they are conflicted due to employment or
other projects they are involved in, and disclose those interests to
other project members.
2. When in doubt, over-disclose. Perceived conflicts of interest are
important to address, so that the lists? decisions are credible even
when unpopular, difficult or favorable to the interests of one group
over another."
I don't doubt that this is a fine plan, but those who work for three
letter agencies or have simply signed NDAs (as an example) aren't
going to disclose anything, nada ~ but will be here anyway, pushing
their personal interests.  Reality.
Looking forward to discussion.

Another point building on Justus's remarks that I'll make.... (below)
Justus Ranvier via bitcoin-dev:
One example that came to mind as I was reading this was, when I
presented an idea that I thought would be good for integration into
Bitcoin Core, explaining in various ways why I felt it would be
worthwhile to explore, I eventually had someone tell me I should go
and develop the idea first as either some sort of independent wallet,
or to demonstrate it would work via an alt.  (This has now occurred,
as a successful implementation of my micro-donations idea has been
demonstrated in an alt.)  I have to wonder, however, when I eventually
bring the micro-donation ideas back in such a form that they could
again be considered in bitcoin-dev, whether or not they would
seriously be considered, in part due to this effect which Justus
Ranvier has described in part ~ that is to say, the effect of people
engaging in the use of "maximalist" or some other label (or labels) as
limiting the extent of discourse which people can engage in.  (I
realize that wasn't exactly where you were going with this Justus, but
I'm just expanding upon the notion of how some labels and categories
can be used to suppress real discussion.)  Or, for example, if people
see me as "conflicted," and someone else doesn't, and I'm confused
about why someone would see me as "conflicted," where does that leave
one?  Quite possibly, stuck in a morass of unproductive commentary (or
maybe just being ignored by moderators who might see quite a few
people as "conflicted").
Another thing to consider, although the person(s) proposing the list
moderation policy and conduct document will certainly not want to hear
it, is that the list might be better off without a policy document
that is enforced by moderators.  (An "about" section for what the list
is about, its purpose, and how people are supposed to treat each
other, is probably good... but the enforcement angle that I'm seeing
is probably a bad idea.)  What we stand for here is more than making
people comfortable while technical issues are discussed on a list.
The idea of keeping a protocol free of financial censorship, in
concept, extends to language as well, and thus people should be able
to be free in how they write and speak, even when their peers on the
list don't like what they see in others' expressions.
I recommend removal of the enforcement and moderator sections.
(Technically, there are mods for it already... I suppose... the
question is how you disclose in a "Purpose" or "About" section that
refers to this list who the mods are, or rather, what the roles are of
each person involved in a way that is minimally invasive and lets the
list flow.)

So, there could not be, for example, a user decision to activate it?
(versus not activate it)?  I'm wondering if something about this can
be boiled down to allowing the user to make a choice on the matter
(turn it on and off).  In Bitcoin-NG, the protocol as follows (as
described in a general overview of it): every 10 minutes, NG elects a
'leader,' who then vets future transactions as soon as they happen. NG
approach supposedly can run as fast as the network will allow.
If this is the case, and if NG functions without major hiccup,
shouldn't a user (of Core, for example) be able to be given the option
to choose between:
(a) being limited by the blocksize and block interval, or
(b) running out as fast as the network will allow (NG)?
The other questions I had pertained to privacy.  How would this scheme
affect users who would be trying to do things like stealth or
confidential transactions?

Another note on this subject to add to the stuff people have already
If you have the AT&T landline but don't use AT&T's standard internet /
tv (what they call Uverse) offering - that is, if you prefer to use
some local internet provider - you are probably better off (in terms
of avoiding not only this sort of blockage/censorship but as well,
potentially getting a better privacy policy that isn't going to be
like AT&T's long-term data retention).  You can check directly with
the various local small ISPs to see what their policies are
specifically on ports and whatnot.
Ideally your ISP should let you:
port forward to SOMEPORTNUMBER for tcp and udp
(above may or may not be helpful for some if you are using
decentralized markets)
have port 8333 open
(above is for bitcoin of course)
Supposing you have FTTN because you are paying a local ISP for
internet service, and that local ISP has contracted with AT&T to be
able to provide service in an area where old-style DSL has been phased
out, thus your local ISP is essentially providing you AT&T FTTN.
(FTTN is Fiber to the Node, FTTN-BP is FTTN Bonded Pair).  Even if a
local ISP has its own privacy policy posted which is different from
AT&T, everything is subject to AT&T data retention because the FTTN.
So get yourself a VPN (or set up your own) for your connection. Tor
will run through the VPN.
General observations - TWC stores your IP and other stuffs for 6
months or longer.  Same for Comcast.  Verizon retains your stuffs for
18 month minimum, probably longer though. Qwest/Century, 1 year.
Cox, 6 months.  AT&T retains for longer than a year.  This is just
what they are telling you, the reality is it's probably longer due to
stuff like this:

that people will continue to keep using SPV wallets because they are
light and handy, I think that you make a good point that "basic fraud
detecting mechanism" is needed, but how to verify that such a
mechanism in an SPV wallet is good, and/or that the software and
version information provided by the server admins via the banner is
valid (being as it's not validated)?  I have made a thread on this
conundrum.  Which is posted here if you are interested.
So as to avoid repeating stuff please read whole thead before
answering in it or posting back to list.  It seems that there are
definitely unanswered questions...
I may open this up as an issue on about this stuff, but I wanted to post comment here also, for the record
