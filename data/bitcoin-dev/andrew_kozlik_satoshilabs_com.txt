Hello everyone,
We are currently writing a new specification for splitting BIP-32 master
seeds into multiple mnemonics using Shamir's secret sharing scheme. We
would be interested in getting your feedback with regard to the
high-level design of the new spec:
Please focus your attention on the section entitled "Master secret
derivation functions", which proposes several different solutions. Note
that there is a Design Rationale section at the very end of the
document, which should answer some of the questions you may have. The
document is a work in progress and we are aware that some technical
details have not been fully specified. These will be completed once the
high level design has been settled.

Thanks for your input Christopher. Since we already have the discussion
about your comments running under the issues in the SLIPs repo on Github
( let's continue it there.

Thank you for your input Ignacio. Looking at your proposal, I see that
its main feature is that it makes one of the shares privileged in the
sense that it must always take part in the reconstruction of the master
secret, while the remaining shares follow the K-of-M scheme. This is an
interesting idea.
To answer your questions:
We intend standardize the encoding format, splitting of the pre-master
secret into shares and the derivation of the master secret from the
pre-master secret in a single document. However, note that only one of
the four proposed master secret derivation functions will be selected
for the final version.
Three of the four proposed master secret derivation functions are
symmetric, which means that they allow users to migrate any existing
master secret (including a BIP-0039 mnemonic) to the new scheme.

@_subject: [bitcoin-dev] BIP-341: Committing to all scriptPubKeys in the 
Hi everyone,
In the current draft of BIP-0341 [1] the signature message commits to the
scriptPubKey of the output being spent by the input. I propose that the
signature message should commit to the scriptPubKeys of *all* transaction
In certain applications like CoinJoin, a wallet has to deal with
transactions containing external inputs. To calculate the actual amount
that the user is spending, the wallet needs to reliably determine for each
input whether it belongs to the wallet or not. Without such a mechanism an
adversary can fool the wallet into displaying incorrect information about
the amount being spent, which can result in theft of user funds [2].
In order to ascertain non-ownership of an input which is claimed to be
external, the wallet needs the scriptPubKey of the previous output spent by
this input. It must acquire the full transaction being spent and verify its
hash against that which is given in the outpoint. This is an obstacle in
the implementation of lightweight air-gapped wallets and hardware wallets
in general. If the signature message would commit to the scriptPubKeys of
all transaction inputs, then the wallet would only need to acquire the
scriptPubKey of the output being spent without having to acquire and verify
the hash of the entire previous transaction. If an attacker would provide
an incorrect scriptPubKey, then that would cause the wallet to generate an
invalid signature message.
Note that committing only to the scriptPubKey of the output being spent is
insufficient for this application, because the scriptPubKeys which are
needed to ascertain non-ownership of external inputs are precisely the ones
that would not be included in any of the signature messages produced by the
The obvious way to implement this is to add another hash to the signature
sha_scriptPubKeys (32): the SHA256 of the serialization of all
scriptPubKeys of the previous outputs spent by this transaction.

Hi Jeremy,
What you are saying is correct and I am not disputing that there is
sufficient cryptographic commitment in the signature message. As I tried to
explain, my proposal is about avoiding the need for the metadata protocol
you speak of. Avoiding such a protocol has been a design goal in both
BIP-143 [1, 2] and BIP-341 [3, 4], because having to acquire each of the
transactions being spent in their entirety places a significant burden on
offline signing devices.

I agree, sha_scriptPubKeys should be included only if hash_type does not
match SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY. I am also sympathetic to aj's idea of making
the scriptPubKey field dependent on hash_type matching SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY.
I also don't really understand the exact attack. So you submit a
For example, in a CoinJoin transaction the attacker can construct a
transaction with two inputs (in1, in2) of identical value and two outputs
of identical value, one belonging to the user (user_out) and another
belonging to the attacker (attacker_out). If such a transaction is sent to
the hardware wallet twice with in1 marked as external the first time and
in2 marked as external the second time, then the hardware wallet will
display two signing requests to the user with spending amounts of in2 -
user_out and in1 - user_out respectively. The user will think that they are
signing two different CoinJoin transactions, while in reality they are
signing two different inputs to a single transaction and sending half of
the amount to the attacker.
As an alternative proposal, I think you can just make a separate BIP for
The proposal of adding sha_scriptPubKeys is just an optimization which is
not intended to change what the signature message is committing to. Thus I
don't see it as warranting a new sigash flag.
Alternatively, there's the scheme described in the email you linked by Greg
Yes, I see this as the correct direction forward. Whatever the exact format
of the ownership proof will be, the proof will need to be signed by the
owner of the UTXO using BIP-0322 or something along those lines. So the
scriptPubKey is needed to verify that signature.
