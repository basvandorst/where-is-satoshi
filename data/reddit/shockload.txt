Makkik are you in the UAE or KSA? I am in the UAE and interested to meet people who are working on developing any products over here.

So basically you have just added some code to show the price in AED and there is nothing local to the UAE about it!!!

Considering how far behind the ME is in online commerce in general not great.

Wonder if all the volume that the bot has created will entice other bots into the party...?

Not to be pedantic, but actually, I think you will find that you started the pedantry... twice.
You pedantic cunt.

Just logged into my IG account which i've had for years. Currently they are only offering binaries.
What I have learned from having an IG account is that day trading is a sure fire way to lose money....
If they do start offering a way to bet directly on the price with margin, then you will have a fairly effective way to hedge your bitcoin holdings. Also they will likely track and allow you to bet on the Winklvoss ETF if it gets approved.
For those in the US they offer CFD's as well as spread betting. UK is spread betting centric as there is no tax on gambing winnings.

All you have to do is connect the dots...
Apple payments announcement + paypal integration + Satoshi email "hacking" + letting block chain back in the app store.
"Further to this it seems obvious that "Just one more thing" at the keynote Tim Cook will send himself 25BTC to the Satoshi ransom address and reveal himself as Satoshi... ;-)

Just download IOS8 and then pop over to Silk Road 2 and scan the QR code...

So rather than dancing around the subject how about explaining it in longhand then?
Some simple questions:
Do you have a local banking partner in the UAE?
Do you have any LEGAL basis for calling it local to the UAE? Such as a trade license or local business partner?
Do I have to pay international transfer fee's in order to buy bit coin with you using you Australian bank?
Am I also going to lose money on the spread in terms of AED - Aussie Dollars or is a Dirham denominated account that I can transfer it into?
I have read it. I simply ask because all of the info I can find on your site basically seems to point to the fact that it is as simple as I stated before.
I however won't be using it as it really isn't local and therefore cost effective for me.

Myspace was about Musician's initially. Thats why it took off and people started to understand what social networks were for. Soundcloud is like myspace for musicians these days. Thats why it is huge.

Are you sure the OP isn't sarcasm?....?, or if you want to be a pedant, Satire?
