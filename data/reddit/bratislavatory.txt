Didn't they have a Bitcoin question like 4 years ago?
Edit: did a search, theyve had a bunch of Bitcoin questions
@_date: 2019-07-31 08:02:05


So probably won't be reading a "what is bitcoin" pamphlet. The pamphlet it's clearly meant for new people
@_date: 2019-07-07 01:00:43
The title explains it pretty well? What part do you want explained?
@_date: 2019-07-03 21:23:50
Damn, their tracking is good!
@_date: 2019-07-08 05:00:39
It would be terrible. Imagine how much more karma whoring there'd be if karma actually had some value

Why do all these things still use the camera and  qr codes rather than nfc like most other payment types?
@_date: 2019-08-15 02:07:17
Why not both?

Anyone have a list of places accepting Bitcoin in NZ?

Not Bitcoin?
Edit: 
This German article seems to say Bitcoin is included
@_date: 2019-10-08 05:46:03
You don't know it's because of coinbase clients
@_date: 2019-08-22 19:23:59
Link to your sources as well

To go with other answers he has released "proof" a couple of times that has been shown to be blatantly fake each time. And Satoshi could easily prove they are who they say they are by just signing a message with one of their keys.
Craig has a bunch of tenuous excuses why he can't do that.
Not forgetting one time during a speech he mentioned how he remembered the first time he heard about Bitcoin, before quickly correcting himself (oh uh I mean when I invented Bitcoin... It was a joke guys...)

Just reading the messages, even before the obvious scammy bit. A random person messages the op and op doesn't ask who they are, just tells them where they live like it's a completely normal occurrence
@_date: 2019-08-21 21:55:38
It's very easy to know who is fake Satoshi

This just has the section where he flubs. I'm on my phone so can't find a better source right now, this was just the first that came up
@_date: 2019-10-08 02:19:41
Automated. The network would be completely unusable of you had to wait for manual payment at each "hop".
@_date: 2019-10-15 02:47:40
That depends what phone wallet they're using. There's plenty of (maybe most?) phone wallets where you have full custody
@_date: 2019-08-20 12:26:12
It's kind of hard to mistype the address and still have it be a valid address
@_date: 2019-10-14 21:01:13
I feel like nfc is way more convenient than scanning a qr with a camera. Just place your phone on the reader, as opposed to waiting for the camera to open, line it up and focus on the qr
@_date: 2019-06-05 07:26:54
You missed the commas. They're suggesting three different things 1. Lightning 2. An altcoin and 3. Fiat
@_date: 2019-06-20 00:40:06
Also lol at point 5. Bitcoin communities are mainly people that just want to get rich. hodl and moon memes dominate over people actually trying to use bitcoin

If it was I'd expect they'd get about 10 spectators/match

From others, if you don't really care about moving it soon then other than double spending it there's not much else to worry about. If it's a really really really low fee it not get confirmed at all. But I've seen even &lt;10 Satoshi transactions getting confirmed after long enough
If you do want to move it soon (or if it's one of those exceptionally low fee transactions), some wallets will still let you send coins in your wallet that have zero confirmations. Look up "child pays for parent". It's no special process, the same as making a normal transaction. Just adding enough fee to incentivise a miner to quickly confirm your new transaction and thus the unconfirmed transaction that it depends on. And they will both be included together in the same block.
Also as others have mentioned. Get setup with the lightning network and stop worrying about confirmation times
@_date: 2019-06-30 04:48:58
If you're just sending it to yourself you don't have to worry about confirmation times

I think some exchanges allowed users to claim/withdraw it without listing it as an exchange pair. Might be wrong though, but I feel like that happened at least with some forks if not bcash

It's just a sketch of the graph from 2015. It's not predicting any future movement

If someone sold their car and house and spent it all on lottery tickets. If they won it still wouldn't mean they're smart.
@_date: 2019-09-14 02:22:56
Put the news as the main link instead of the meme. Without going to the comments this just looks like something you made up
@_date: 2019-09-11 04:10:07


Who's buying back everyone's what?
Not sure exactly what this means, but it's not something that exchanges are doing. Exchanges typically aren't really buying back anything from anyone.
@_date: 2019-09-11 04:36:25
Can you show an example of this happening? Coinbase won't be doing anything on the block chain until you withdraw Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-09-30 02:14:52
Look up what an analogy is
@_date: 2019-09-30 02:26:44
I wasn't comparing Bitcoin to lottery is was clarifying that putting money in to something and coming out on top doesn't mean it was smart.
I like Bitcoin. I just don't all these "Bitcoin is good because it goes up" posts which make up 75% of this sub. There's better reasons than that
@_date: 2019-09-07 09:55:30
Because there's a whole lot of nothing in Western Australia. What other parts of WA are you expecting to see adoption?

Doesn't necessarily mean is a good idea to invest. 
If you "invest" money in some lotto tickets and win, doesn't mean it was a good idea. 
Bitcoin is still massively speculative. It's probably better to invest in something less risky. Though at 19, it's not a bad idea to step into some more risky assets.
I just don't like these "it's gud bcuz it went up" posts
@_date: 2019-09-11 01:55:16
What exactly do you want them to hash? What do you mean by "the volume hour"? The volume traded per hour? How exactly do you expect them to hash that in a way that people can verify it's any more real than what they're doing now?
I feel like you're misunderstanding something about either what exchange volume is or what a hash is.
@_date: 2019-09-11 04:14:05
I think you have a fundamental misunderstanding of what an exchange does and how they generally work.
I'm on a phone right now so can't really type out much if an explanation. Might edit later with some clarification

Why would preferred wallets vary by country?
@_date: 2019-05-20 21:38:58
On a platform that's a lot easier to read
@_date: 2019-05-07 02:14:45
Yeah, they're not interested in Bitcoin. They're interested in something that's price is increasing. And now want to "invest" more because the price is going up? That's some shit reasoning to invest.
Or maybe they did look into it a bit and find out some reasons they like it. But all OP mentioned was price
@_date: 2019-05-12 22:59:40
Bitcoin fees don't vary by country, and transfer times don't vary by wallet (or country). Bit confused about what you're asking about. Do you mean to ask for best exchange for Canadians?
