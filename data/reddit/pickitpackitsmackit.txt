Aww shucks!!
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:16:19
Printed money from Chinese warehouses is the answer!!!!!!!!!!!

Your comment reminded me of some other redditor who said that to me a day or two ago. They said something along the lines of:


@_date: 2014-04-21 03:39:32
this is why we cant have nice things...
shady hardware manufacturers will be the downfall of crypto
@_date: 2014-06-02 03:18:59
Ahh that's so awesome!
@_date: 2014-12-17 02:23:16
I find her tryhardiness and misuse of "urban" slang to be very unappealing. But, at least she got people to ask what bitcoin is!
@_date: 2014-02-28 04:49:52
Someone at JP Morgan probably wrote his letter for him.
@_date: 2014-05-14 01:41:27
Not with all the fuckery from the ASIC manufacturers.
@_date: 2014-12-01 01:44:45
Wow, fuck ebay and paypal and their fraudulent bullshit.
@_date: 2014-04-26 14:52:30
Butterfly Labs, you fraudulent fucks. Quit mining btc with our prepaid hardware and giving them away. You're already 2 months behind schedule. Do you want fraud investigations? Because this is how you get fraud investigations.
@_date: 2014-10-23 22:20:10
Burn, Butterfly Labs, burn!!
@_date: 2014-10-18 00:40:52
And they will ensure to make it as dark as they can.
@_date: 2014-10-15 03:28:27
Google has been letting a lot of scammers get away with placing ads at the top of searches. Had a customer search the Cisco phone number and the top ad, which their noobself clicked on, gave them the phone number to one of those scammers operatons that remote in and show them all the errors in their event viewer and then want to charge $300 to "fix them".
@_date: 2014-09-20 02:20:26
Weird right?! Almost like appreciating consumer protections, but disliking over-reaching authoritarian policies is a good thing!!
@_date: 2014-09-04 00:53:14
Speaking of the Federal Reserve, let's get rid of this blatant scam already.
@_date: 2014-05-02 05:13:14
boosh and/or kakow!
@_date: 2014-12-13 18:54:56
I felt extremely lucky when I saw my wire refund hit my bank account the same day the raid rumors started on here.
@_date: 2014-09-29 23:35:23
Yes, thanks. I saw the news story video last week. Weird there wasn't much talk about it here.
@_date: 2014-03-06 19:16:45
Well damn, that's a blast from the past!
@_date: 2014-12-15 00:59:19
That meme has been around for a few years.
@_date: 2014-09-06 22:54:22
Yes, that's how advertising works.
@_date: 2014-06-29 18:22:46
So is everything illegal until some out-of-touch politician so graciously gives the citizens their permission slip?
@_date: 2014-08-28 00:46:48
Gotta say, I liked this better when it was GPU mining. This environment where the Chinese manufacturers are controlling the network is a bit ridiculous and makes me lose faith in the system.
@_date: 2014-09-22 22:41:33
So did the raid happen or not?
Either way, I'm just glad I finally received my refund from these scumbags!!
@_date: 2014-07-20 19:45:41
Thanks Dell for selling me stuff!!
@_date: 2014-08-28 03:27:50
Yea, but it's still Darkcoin and no one takes it.
@_date: 2014-03-22 20:41:03
Ahhh... the good ol' days!
@_date: 2015-01-11 10:48:26
Weird, almost like a handful of asic manufacturers generating and essentially controlling a currency is a bad thing.
@_date: 2015-01-12 17:26:23
That sounds like a poorly thought out plan.
@_date: 2015-01-07 01:16:11
I'm always late to the party :/
@_date: 2015-01-12 17:35:36
So much for decentralized...
@_date: 2015-01-12 17:10:36
Was the desired method of bitcoin functionality to be controlled by the Chinese manufacturers who were sourced to make the ASIC hardware?
@_date: 2015-01-09 05:25:54
More like "The Magic of Killing Bitcoin Price"

Surprised the anchor text wasn't changed to correct the typo.

All the smart people are selling all of their holdings before the floor gives out and bitcoins are dropped to $0.20/btc!! Sell before it's too late, so I can buy some on the cheapcheap!!
@_date: 2017-03-23 22:33:11










Haven't thought of it this way before. Thanks! 
@_date: 2016-06-21 15:39:20
I guess it depends on who you are watching, eh?
@_date: 2017-08-26 02:14:56
lol The DMV uses CC processing to get a little extra profit. That's sad. The almost 3% for CC processing is normal, but that extra dollar surcharge is pretty funny.
@_date: 2017-01-12 07:15:53
lol k
@_date: 2016-06-17 17:50:37
I was in at about $800-$850 mark, so I have a little way to go though :D
@_date: 2017-01-15 20:57:38
Is your Coin Base wallet "currency" also? No, it's just an *account* where you store the actual *currency* (bitcoin). PayPal is just an account where you store your *currency* (US Dollars).
@_date: 2017-08-26 02:31:45
lol look at the mememaster over here!!
@_date: 2017-01-15 20:54:09
That's an account, not a currency. Saying that PayPal is currency is like saying that your Coin Base wallet is currency.
@_date: 2016-06-25 16:37:15
In just a couple years NC has become the laughing stock of the country. It's really a shame it's being ruined by corrupt crony politics, because there are nice cities here and beautiful wildlife and nature.
@_date: 2017-08-26 02:33:22
Sorry buddy, we'll try harder to please you!
@_date: 2017-08-26 02:34:09
Technically speaking, I thought your meme post was pretty fucking funny, and spot on.
@_date: 2016-11-06 01:42:13
Kind of hard to buy the hardware and compete with the people who actually build the hardware.
@_date: 2016-11-06 00:15:33
CPUs can be bought by anyone, specialized ASIC miners cannot.


@_date: 2017-08-08 21:59:31
Thanks for clearing that up!!
@_date: 2017-08-26 02:32:09
It dipped a few days ago. I know it didn't seem like much of a dip because it was still in the $3,600s, but I'm a little sad that I didn't throw a few bucks at it.
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:13:05
Oh, you were joking about $10K?
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:02:15

It's Coinbase official now!!
PS: Litecoin hit over $100!!

Won't someone please think of the violent criminals and their families!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2016-02-04 19:00:59
Yea, and then physically disconnect the backup medium, because the ransomwares will encrypt all data they can access.
@_date: 2016-02-14 20:36:12
The guy is actually really funny!
@_date: 2016-02-04 18:58:51
Ransomware encrypts all data it can modify, including externals and network shares. So what you should say is, "Or you could back up your data, then disconnect the backup medium."

The headline was a brilliant outtake to make the article viral so the author can sell more of his book he advertises at the end.

Never even heard of either of these places and I received this email today.

Never heard of that site and I received this Global Advisor email today.
@_date: 2015-09-13 22:18:54
Definitely keep spamming her/your site every day or two like no one will notice.
@_date: 2015-09-16 00:56:59
I never registered there and got this email.
@_date: 2016-10-22 23:52:12
Yes, actually. If you clicked the link and read those few little lines where he mentions the bit of relevancy.

Faux-conservatives are ruining NC.
@_date: 2015-11-05 04:10:33
Hey, what a coincidence!! I would like someone to give me a lot of Bitcoins also!

Thanks for the reply, I will check out Poloniex after work!

My buys are going in. I have to wait 5 business days, but they are hitting my wallet. Well, the buy from last week came through, and a new buy today seems to be on track for next Thursday.
@_date: 2015-10-16 02:26:10
That's what I was thinking, too. But after 48 hours my stomach started hurting thinking about it, so I thought it was time to ask the power of @_date: 2017-05-22 02:16:22
Cute setup for a viral pic

Thank you! Now that I have changetip setup, I deposited a couple more bucks and as soon as that completes I can send a tip over to basil00 for his help!
@_date: 2015-10-16 02:31:27
It worked!! Thank you very much!! Faith in bitcoin restored!!!
I would like to send you a token of my appreciation, ~~but I don't have the tip service setup here on reddit. Can you give me an address to shoot a tip to?~~
Let's see if I'm doing this right. $5.00 @_date: 2015-10-26 21:30:07
Policing for profit is getting out of hand.
@_date: 2016-05-02 01:42:48
Yea, they intentionally sold him the computer and its contents. It was up to the seller to verify that any data need to be removed or not. Should he give back any licenses for the MS Office or other software that was installed. I'm guessing *no*.
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:26:48


@_date: 2016-05-04 15:41:38
And this is exactly why Bitcoin has been hobbled. The general public won't want a "decentralized" currency that is controlled by a small group of random people in China who happened to get their hands on ASIC hardware first.
@_date: 2015-10-16 03:30:41
Okay, sorry about that. I have changetip setup now.
@_date: 2017-05-19 16:57:35
I had no idea it existed, but I appreciate the information. I'll look into it in a little bit. Thank you!

Look at this guy, sticking with the same username for 6 years!
@_date: 2015-10-16 01:13:13

China cornered the bitcoin market when they started manufacturing ASICs and stuffing warehouses full of them, effectively generating most of the new bitcoins. So yea, this news of them "cornering the market" is years old.
@_date: 2015-02-14 10:22:27
Hah, can't do that with fiat!

So they sell at a higher than listed btc price and also increased fees? Okay... Seems like they are getting a little complacent.

The extra convolution of the donation process seems like it would make total donations dwindle.
@_date: 2017-06-25 22:31:48
With all the fees Coinbase charges, one would expect a more stable service to be available when the customer needs it to be, not whenever it's convenient for Coinbase's profit margin.
