You also have to remember you cannot work forever.  You will  in future get sick and old and will need substantial  funds.   Savings are a big necessity.   If you don't have atleast   20k in savings  and life insurance  is suggest you  put some of your monthly  into that before gambling  away your money.

@_date: 2018-12-19 21:10:49
Stupidity is rife  .  If crypto  does fail  this will be a major part.
@_date: 2018-12-23 21:42:10

This have nothing to do with finance.  That's government.    Stupid post.
@_date: 2018-12-05 15:20:55
You are doing some dodgy  shit.  It's that simple.  If you could legitimately  show them listen  I got this money  this way.  Or  I bought these coins  at this price, they wouldn't  risk a lawsuit.    Yes companies make mistakes.   But unless you are money laundering, trying evade taxes, or you stole those coins from somewhere else.  You would get it back.
It's clear by what people have been saying your up  to some shit,  hopefully you didn't take that money  from a cartel.   
@_date: 2018-12-22 08:50:34
Fucking  hell. Please  stop.  Your really embarrassing yourself and  us.
@_date: 2018-12-29 02:13:36
Lol  lots of random Assumption  and speculation.  Your in the right place OP  good job.
@_date: 2018-12-29 15:48:36
You do know most apps and new technologies  fail right ?  Their are loads of websites  apps and other technologies that started off strong and are  dead or just barely alive. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 22:45:48
 More bs   to mislead people  in believing  this is a 100% ticket to richs.      Crypto as a whole could  crash and  fade away.   Once again this is all speculation.    There is a high possibility you will loose money.     Even if  crypto takes off  It will have a few coins  and  some people will get rich.   But Alot of people will  loose money.    Alot of the coins out there could  crash and Bitcoin is no exception.
@_date: 2018-12-02 09:49:52
Please come.up with I know it will kill me but I'm just not gonna breath today.  That is all.
@_date: 2018-12-25 23:14:31
Wtf is wrong with you people.    You won't get rich from holding  a few coins for a yea or two. If you buy it's for many 10 years it  may be worth something.  This is the example ofnstuoid posts people make and   e very one of us looks like fools.
@_date: 2018-12-12 16:44:09
Some people buy a 100k car and take all the badges off and make it look like a lower model .  Regardless  he proberly sold a bunch  at a much higher price.
@_date: 2018-12-17 00:04:57
God fucking damnit.  Just one  time, just  one fucking time I'd love to  not see this bullshit.
@_date: 2018-12-30 01:31:30
Life.   Life is the internet's partner.
@_date: 2018-12-18 21:55:27
Yea it's called common sense.   Sell high  buy low.  Very basic  concept.  Here  is a example .  I bought at   xrp at 45 cents  watched it go to 3 dollars,  saw it dropping and sold at  2, 80.   I have since then I have been slowly buying at major drops   equalling in a fuck load more coins.   But yes you.  Hold on to yours.
@_date: 2018-12-02 00:21:47
Ok your sad maby a little finger   o o my bad I mis read this 
@_date: 2018-12-30 01:27:58
This shit again ?  You got a crystal ball  homie  ?
@_date: 2018-12-12 18:55:08

@_date: 2018-12-14 22:54:04
And Bitcoin can die just like any other coin.  You are not a fucking  psychic  are you.
@_date: 2018-12-29 02:15:09
It's a precious. Metal or commodity ?   When  your making this  case are you smoking crack also ?  everything  makes sense when your on the pipe.
@_date: 2018-12-29 15:12:40
Care to show  how you came about with 5 years ?   Any past things we can look to for guidance ?  Or you just pull that from your ass  like every one else.
@_date: 2018-12-12 09:19:31
Huh ?     You.dont  make money unless you.hold ?  That makes no sense .
@_date: 2018-12-12 09:46:25
I didn't know you could go into  Mercedes and pay wity bitcoin  when  did that happen.  And he must have bought Bitcoin  at  a few cents  if he bought a 300k car  at these prices. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 10:56:10
Sorry they are aroubd 80 to 100 depending on  options.
