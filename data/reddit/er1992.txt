Will it get confirmed tho in time to exploit that arbitrage

Yeah sure let's completely ignore the fact that the unacceptable tx fees are a real issue with BTC now. BCH is getting a pump.
We can always entertain ourselves with some shitty memes while our beloved coin is losing grounds to your so-called shitcoin. So dumb...

Yeah man. Sell right now. It's the end of Bitcoin as we know it. Come, come my child. I'll do you a huge favour and buy all your Bitcoins.

The thing is Coinbase has restricted trading volume to a mere $250 per week which is stupid. And the rest where you can actually buy high volume have much less to zero arbitrage

Yeah giving everyone a living wage, closing the income gap ever so slightly, providing healthcare to all, combating existential threat of climate change to human race, taking the tax bracket back to what it was in the most prosperous period of America (70s), eliminating corporate and dark money influence in politics, forgiving student debt ... They all sound like shitty plans. Let's just stick to trickle down and cutting safety nets. Hasn't worked for the past 30 years but hey it might just start to work this year ... You fucking inbred mongrel

I would so love to see what would happen to the US if it basically got sanctioned by the biggest world economy just like Venezuela did. Also if we continue on the same inequality path. I'd assume Venezuela would be a happy ending compared to the shit that would happen here.
A more socialistic US (70s) was considered more prosperous. I don't what drug you're on saying it's working out right now for us.
Shove that 3% a place others can't find because it's an embarrassment. Shallow idiots like yourself don't care to look into the details. Do you know the quality of the jobs created? Do you know that figure does not include underemployed and people who have given up looking for a job? Do you know a lot of the jobs created under Trumptard are extremely low income, low quality and temporary jobs? I guess you didn't know any of that.
S&amp;P at ATH. So what? That's literally the worst indicator of how well ordinary people are doing in an economy. I guess you didn't know that either because again you're a moron.
Yeah Apple is bringing a few jobs back, at the same time our farmers are losing all of their international buyers and most other industries like car manufacturers and fishing companies are sending jobs overseas. See I can pick out convenient examples too.
Ahh it all makes sense. A silicon valley snob. Live in your bubble and enjoy it but my advise get out of that shithole and stop wasting your life away there. I got out a while back. 
p.s. I'm probably a much better code you'll ever be kiddo

He's basically come out full fledged supporting the Brazilian president who's on record for hating gays and is terrible with homosexual rights. Basically a Trump like maniac who's out to make the world a shittier place. 
p.s. Rubin is gay ���� fucking sellout
