I'm no expert I just scanned over some stuff about escrow 
@_date: 2018-05-22 13:05:04
but how would i know where to send the you bought?
@_date: 2018-05-22 11:34:46
Thank you for taking a look at look at my store, and for the information on fiat, can you send me some links on fiat? it sounds interesting and i will take a look into it
@_date: 2018-05-22 17:26:20
totally awesome
@_date: 2018-05-23 09:53:20
I took a quick look and I think they offer features that I can create or adapt as an open source project so maybe not.
@_date: 2018-05-22 22:10:05
OK Just bumped up the screen res for the homepage, so it should look a little better
@_date: 2018-05-22 14:50:44
thank you!
@_date: 2018-05-22 21:11:32
Edit: done :P
@_date: 2018-05-22 12:33:49
thank you very much, that's great to hear! I think it's the way forward. We'll see how it goes :)
@_date: 2018-05-22 23:16:41
wow.  a search engine for things you can buy with Bitcoin. That's a really good Idea. i will take a look at this very soon. Thank you Sendabit. Please keep in touch!
@_date: 2018-05-22 15:37:02
Can you PM me your email address please?
Edit: All is well, shipping is now in process. :)
@_date: 2018-05-25 01:28:41
This is so cool, i have a store that sells crypto merch for crypto and ive also just discovered these designs. They're great! I'd like to know more about your community. Feel free to pm me or visit my store  :) 
@_date: 2018-05-27 23:51:53
I hope I can get some constructive responses soon. I might just be wasting my time here
@_date: 2018-05-27 18:14:03
Escrow costs money and isn't automated and far less user friendly and takes longer in terms of setup. I've explained the part about disputes. 
@_date: 2018-05-22 12:32:35
Edit: Ok i believe it's all ready.
@_date: 2018-05-22 15:41:10
wow that's a great idea, thanks!
@_date: 2018-05-23 10:19:56
Hello again sendabit, i will put up a "how-to" section for new bitcoin users and i will put your search engine on my website so people know they can get more for bitcoin than what's offered at my store, because i think you guys have a great idea. I now have the mofobit.com URL so i can submit my store when I get it out of Beta (and i start actively looking for customers!). Thanks for the link, and feel free to stay in touch!
@_date: 2018-05-22 22:11:44
its just the start my friend :)
@_date: 2018-05-22 11:22:38
hello holding to the moon, thats an awesome name by the way! I will take a look that sounds great. Thanks :)
@_date: 2018-05-22 22:59:20
Hello! I have just received confirmation. That's awesome, thank you! It's fully paid and I will start shipping right away. I'll throw in a small gift too. Thanks :)
edit: I'm literally about to put up a tracker so you can view the transaction sending/receiving. It's a really useful tool, it can be found here: 
just type  in the name of the address and you can see it working.
@_date: 2018-05-22 13:13:54
thank you, and wow great comment. I will change that angular icon next, and as for taxes, I live in Switzerland so tax here is not a problem. I act as my own stock broker and the prices reflect the current market value of the main currencies, this is why I will accept alt coin on an email-basis, when i get good at that I can set up a payment system for those too but i doubt it will be that lucrative. It would be fun though.
Edit: Icon fixed :)
@_date: 2018-05-22 12:32:15
Thank you for this. I will take a look! Nice name by the way ;)
@_date: 2018-05-22 11:41:55
i support LTC, ETH, BCH, and contact my stock-broker account and we can trade in almost any coin out there ;)
@_date: 2018-05-22 11:38:54
USD is used as a reference value, when you get to the payment section the store will convert the price for BTC, ETH,  BCH, and LTC at its current market value
@_date: 2018-05-22 21:28:26
Thanks! I've worked hard to keep the price low. While the store is in Beta I'm limited to google and Fb but soon you'll be able to log in with normal email, github, even twitter
@_date: 2018-05-23 23:29:30
So true. I joined on March 2nd when the price was around 8700.
@_date: 2018-05-22 14:05:04
It's already a success. I don't need customers to be proud of Mofobit. :)
@_date: 2018-05-24 22:14:56
If i get this working. Will you use my store?
@_date: 2018-05-22 11:17:46
thats great! what kind of stuff are you interested in selling?
@_date: 2018-05-22 20:59:18
Hahaha omg thank you so much haahahahaha
@_date: 2018-05-22 15:34:45
Hi Dr Steve Bruel, I will take a look at the confirmed payments, just a minute.
@_date: 2018-05-22 21:10:36
man i've been waiting for somebody to reference that guy who flips out when it's called bcash
@_date: 2018-05-22 12:30:42
both are extremely valuable. It's hard to choose!
@_date: 2018-05-22 11:06:51
Sure! It's still in progress for mobiles, but works well on desktop imo, let me know what you think! :D
@_date: 2018-05-22 15:14:51
i dont get much from this comment, it probably isn't worth typing this response but if you aren't as stuck up as you seem, maybe you can tell me what LN stands for because i have no idea what you're talking about.
@_date: 2018-05-22 11:40:42
yes, this facebook and gmail is only for beta, soon you will be able to log in via email, even github  and twitter.
which sounds weird to me as well, but it's happening!
@_date: 2018-05-22 13:01:24
no its cool I'm open to the idea of USD payments. I'm a software engineer so the idea of getting this technology to work and to see how well it runs is my motivation, I will implement USD really soon for the customer, but for now I'm really keen to be one of the first stores out there for BTC and alt currency. But I understand where you're coming from
@_date: 2018-05-22 13:53:59
i like you
@_date: 2018-05-22 11:42:54
Yes indeed! Shipping takes 30 days. I hope thats OK with you. Which part of the UK btw?
@_date: 2018-05-22 13:53:30
cool, thanks for the advice, i've addressed a lot of those points already, for example i have a .com url but ive also had a nagging feeling about the stockbroker name, i believe the stockbroker name. it oculd be a lot shorter, maybe "trader or something like that.
@_date: 2018-05-22 12:33:21
@_date: 2018-05-22 20:59:00
Ah damn I will take a look at that. Can you let me know, what's the screen resolution on your Ipad? I will fix that up for you.
@_date: 2018-05-22 11:09:10
sure! i accept litecoin, ethereum, and B-cash. im the web developer and the stock broker for mofobit, so people who want to pay in &lt;insert coin here&gt; can email me with their offer. This is the best part of the website imo ;)
would you like to take a look? It's still in progress for mobiles, but works well on desktop imo, let me know what you think! :D 
@_date: 2018-05-22 11:54:24
I can can implement credit card-payments very easily but that's boring :P
@_date: 2018-05-22 17:25:04
based in Switzerland my friend :)
@_date: 2018-05-22 14:32:19
are you for real? try scrolling down the page man c'mon.
@_date: 2018-05-28 00:21:23
I'm failing to explain or you're failing to understand, either way it's a waste of time.
@_date: 2018-05-22 17:36:53
Thank you! I really appreciate it
@_date: 2018-05-22 21:04:34
Indeed! I spent some time reading about this and I really want to use the lightning network. I hear it's a bit buggy but I'll to do the research and make changes to the back end. For instant transactions it's well worth it. It will take some time though.
@_date: 2018-05-22 14:06:43
ouch, feel the burn
@_date: 2018-05-22 11:47:58
oh very nice. I lived in southville for a while. I used to take my lunch breaks in queens square. There is a great falafel place in St Nicholas. I still visit  that place each time i go to Bristol. It's a great city :)
@_date: 2018-05-22 14:33:56
K. I made a "view store" button in case your screen res gives you the impression you need to log in first.
@_date: 2018-05-23 19:33:45
Hello djLyfeAlert, thanks for your message. It's really kind of you to reach out but I can not commit to much more at the moment. Do you have a facebook page? It would be good to talk to you about this in the future. Thanks!
@_date: 2018-05-22 17:34:49
ahh, well im glad i asked. The time it takes for transactions have made customers nervous, esp in my situation as im new but for sure this would be useful. I will put some more research into this. Thanks for letting me know!
@_date: 2018-05-22 13:19:51
cool. thanks for the input
@_date: 2018-05-22 11:11:54
I realize I've been posting the link to the thread and not to what I thought was a PM. I'm new to Reddit. but i not getting swamped so thats OK i will just put the links in the thread i guess :)
@_date: 2018-06-27 21:56:11
No problem :)
@_date: 2018-06-22 09:22:36
Thanks! We will also have the lightning network up and running really soon
@_date: 2018-06-12 09:10:59
Hey Fuck\_Banksters! Good to hear from you again. Yeah I must say this exact thought went through my head when I put up that item:
@_date: 2018-06-12 01:03:34
I will have the lightning network on my store in the next 2 weeks. Would you like to buy some thing? ;)  
@_date: 2018-06-05 09:13:50
I like it.
@_date: 2018-06-27 17:33:19
I got in at around 8,500 and still holding 
@_date: 2018-06-27 21:31:43
I am using the Eclair Wallet on my mobile to test LN payments on my website [ the version that allows LN payments has been released just now.
@_date: 2018-06-02 12:21:16
It's funny. Here in Switzerland, it's so small that the claim "If it's said to be but I can't see it then it's not here" actually stands pretty well.
@_date: 2018-06-03 08:57:27
You could buy a tshirt from mofobit.com ;)
Just sayin'... 
@_date: 2018-06-27 22:00:09
Hey Fuck\_Banksters, it's on! I have the LN now! :D
@_date: 2018-06-02 12:17:45
Is this in Zurich? I live in Zurich. If it's near me I will take pictures to confirm.
@_date: 2018-06-07 16:00:29
I wish I could vote here. But I hope it gets through. I will spread the message!
@_date: 2018-06-22 07:39:56
:) 
@_date: 2018-07-07 16:21:01
Im totally bias here but it does feel good to spend crypto. This is why i set up mofobit.com.
I want to spread value any way i can. If you want PM me and ill give you 10% off any purchase from my store. 
@_date: 2018-07-03 01:29:03
I sell these stickers in packs of 300 on my website if you'd like to take a look, but of course, please stick them responsibly!
Www.mofobit.com

How do you administer your wallet to this machine? How do i contact the companies that make these devices? I have some ideas for the future and these machines would really help.
