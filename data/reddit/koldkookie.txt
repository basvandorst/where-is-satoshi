There are no super computer that comes even close to the computing power of the Bitcoin network, because of the highly specialized ASIC computers that is used for Bitcoin mining. I haven't checked the numbers, but I would be surprised if the combined computer power of the US government data centers would amount to even 1% of the network, if they started mining.

They would need 51% of the mining power, not the nodes. That would be extremely costly.

I'm on the board of a medium size company (revenue about 
$40 million), the local board of a political party and the boards of a couple of smaller companies as well. None of them have a mechanism for the board to remove individual board members through voting. 
I'm not saying this holds true for the Foundation, obviously the bylaws can include such a mechanism. It just seems a bit strange from my perspective. In my experience, a board is often put together to represent diverse interest among the members/owners, and giving the majority of a board the means to expel a minority seems to counteract that.

We can also learn something from two hard forks that were supposedly simple but were nonetheless very badly executed: Bitcoin Cash (with a new emergency difficulty adjustment that turned out to be completely broken) and Bitcoin Segwit2X (which contained an off-by-one-bug that froze the chain just before the fork was planned to take place). One year lead time might be overly conservative, but recent examples have emphasized the value of caution.

His percentage isn't necessarily small. Roger invested much earlier than the others, when the valuation of the company was lower. He could have invested a relatively small amount and still be an influential shareholder.
In 2012 Roger claimed to own 25 % of the company ( His percentage has probably been diluted since then, but could still be significant.

Blockchain.info doesn't have/store your private keys, it's a non-custodian wallet.
@_date: 2018-05-07 15:06:49
I was a bit unclear, sorry for that. What I mean is that blockchain.info doesn't store your unencrypted keys. They store the keys encrypted with your password. And when you log in the keys are decrypted on the client side. This means that neither they nor a hacker can access your funds, without having access to your password (or possibly brute forcing your password if it's weak).

I first checked out Bitcoin when it was around $4. Tried buying some, but the option to buy with credit card had just been taken away, and I didn't feel like sending money to Japan.

I'm not in any way advocating for blockchain.info, in fact I haven't used them myself for many years. I just try to add some facts into the debate. In this case the fact that blockchain.info, when working as intended and not being compromised, does not have access to your private keys.

There are 200k btc to be distributed to creditors one way or another. It's still not decided if they will be distributed as btc or sold for fiat first.

Bloomberg is wrong (as usual). The bitcoins was sold between December and February, according to the bankruptcy trustee. Which just means that the downward pressure was even bigger during those months.
On the other hand your calculations are wrong. Approximately 160 000 bitcoins were mined December through February.

My guess is that he planned on selling more or less the same amount (he moved around 40 million of each BTC and BCH as seen on the blockchain), but that he stopped when he had enough to cover the claims. 
Myself, I would have preferred it if he would just have sold bcash and kept as much of our (the creditors) bitcoins as possible.

The timeline for the vote for the Mt Gox civil rehabilitation plan has been pushed back until later in the spring, and after that we are probably looking at ~6 months before payout.

There seems to be a lot of confusion about the Mtgox bancrupcy trustee and his BTC selloff. Here is what we actually know (from official records and information given to people present at the creditor meeting):
- The trustee sold around 36k BTC + 36k BCH between December and February. The average price was around $10.4k/BTC.
- The proceeds from the sale almost exactly equals the total claims filed (where 1 claimed BTC is fixed in value to ~$460. In fact, it seems that after reaching this threshold the trustee stopped selling.
- The trustee still holds ~165k BTC + BCH. He announced he MIGHT sell more in the future after consulting the court. 
- No mention has been made of how other bitcoin forks  under the trustees control will be handled.
- The addresses for the remaining Mtgox Bitcoins are known. If the trustee moves them, anyone watching the addresses will know.
- At the moment the court is contemplating moving Mtgox out of bankruptcy and into civil rehabilitation, since the rising price of BTC means that the assets exceed the liabilities. The point of this would be to make it possible for the surplus to go to the Mtgox creditors instead of the Mtgox shareholders. A decision is expected in the coming months.
- A majority of the creditors wish to be payed in BTC rather than fiat. The trustee is still investigating if this is possible according to Japanese law.

Government action can definitely cause bumps in the road for cryptocurrencies. However, here are some other aspects to take into consideration:
1. Governments have not just started to act. China has increased regulations around Bitcoin a number of times already, and Bitcoin continue to strive.  The same with the US and the EU. The recent China-ban only set the price back to what was the all time high only a few weeks earlier. 
2. By now there are a lot of important people - high politicians and rich businesspeople among them - who are heavily invested in Bitcoin. They will use their influence to curb any too draconian measures.
3. The very reason government might want to control Bitcoin is the reason they can't. Bitcoin is decentralized without single points of failure. Government actions might hamper usage, but can't stop it.
4. Cryptocurrencies is a whole new finance sector with a lot of new use cases, and as such it brings economical growth. The countries who embrace the new technology probably stands to gain a lot. And as this becomes obvious, more and more countries will adopt a positive stance to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.

Actually, the bitcoins from the Genesis block is unspendable by design. I think Satoshis reasoning was that it was more fair that way since noone else had the opportunity to mine those, while all later blocks were possible to mine for anyone who dedicated processing power to the network.
It's the other blocks purportedly mined by Satoshi that people are watching. I think the main fear is that the price would tank if Satoshi moved any of his coins. Many believes they are lost and so not part of the available supply, if Satoshi starts move his/her/their coins it means the supply is bigger than many thought, which can bring the price down.
Myself, I definitely believe Satoshis coins are still in his/her/their possession. Satoshi was very clear that you should never delete/thow away any private keys, I'd be surprised if Satoshi would have been careless about his/her/their own keys.

A low price limits Bitcoin's usefulness for transactions as well. How do you make a payment worth $500 million with a currency with a 3 billion market cap? You can't. If the price remain at this level Bitcoin can still be revolutionary, but less so.

My best guess is that someone accidentally made a large market buy order (meaning that the order will be filled at whatever price is available until the money put on the order runs out).

1 BTC actually has 100 million Satoshis.

The Willy investor? I'll invest in that!

Someone accidentally placed a large market order, most likely. Happens sometimes.

Thanks! That whole discussion was a good read.

Becomes rich - spends it on cheeseburgers? I'm sure France can offer more tantalizing flavors.

It's an appallingly bad piece. There doesn't seem to be anything about bitcoin that might be good. The phrase "the problem is that it is a global currency" really says it all.

What are you talking about? Kraken is at $2535 right now, and have been trading at between $2500 and $2580 for the last hour at least.

This is really cool! I hope it gains traction.

BCC might possibly have som value after August 1th, but my guess is that it will be tiny in that case. The valuation of 0.2 BTC per BCC that OP mentions means nothing. There is only one market and the volume there is almost non-existing (55 BTC the last 24h). It's trivial for any player with a vested interest to manipulate a market that small.
Edit: looking directly at the ViaBTC website I see that there is actually some real volume, especially for the trading pair BCC/CNY. I still don't think the price will hold up very well after August 1th, but I might be wrong. We'll see.

The Economist is one of the world's most respected magazines. This is cool!

I'll settle for 1 bit = $1. That happens when BTC reach one million dollars. And a nice step on the way will be when bit/cent reach parity, at BTC $10 000.

The price was set around $450 (and then converted to Yen) for the bankruptcy proceedings.

1) Be ecstatic about reaching the billion bits club.
2) Refuse to spend even one satosi for fear of falling out of the billion bits club.

No, I think they still have around 44 000 BTC after this.

Thanks! $1

Does anyone know if any lightning wallets for iPhone is on the way?

I bought a HTC M8 mobile phone for 2+ BTC a few years back. Fortunately I bought right back in.

The idea of Bitcoin and the blockchain became public with the white paper in  October 2008, like you say. But I don't think it's wrong to say that Bitcoin and the first blockchain came into existence on 3 January 2009, when the Genesis block was mined.
