Hello Trezor salesman

Reeee business people bad &gt;:( investing in a startup should provide zero benefit and we should stifle new developments
@_date: 2019-07-14 16:46:55
I'm just happy you can finally have microtransactions on Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-07-16 21:17:05
This makes me irrationally angry. Imagine thinking that not only inflation (indirect taxation) is justified, but literal forced theft of people's money is justified to prop up the bubble.

What is the size of your investment? If it's below 1K, I recommend accessible mobile wallets like "Bitcoin Lightning Wallet", "Eclair" or "Coinomi" (the first 2 allow you to use Lightning, and the last allows you to use many different coins, though only really BTC and ETH are worth a damn). If it's above 1K, you may want to consider a hardware or paper wallet.

Fees to transact on lightning: between 0 and 1 sat, or a bit more if you're unlucky (as much as USD0.02!).
@_date: 2019-07-18 16:49:28
***256760*** sent, not 256.70. 128.78 fee.
@_date: 2019-07-22 19:36:59
It arrived! Out of interest, how much did you pay in fees?
@_date: 2019-07-19 18:48:00
If your fee is 0 or tiny, confirmation might not come in the 2 weeks before your transaction is dropped from the mempool and forgotten about.
@_date: 2019-07-07 16:15:46
Bitcoin could be powered for 4 years solely by standby devices in the US being properly switched off. Technology innovation should not slow down, energy production should speed up.
@_date: 2019-07-08 10:06:53
It should be noted that the same delusional Luke Dash Jr who is unwilling to fix this glaring issue (wow, there are LITERALLY no legitimate reasons for address reuse, what are donations?) is also proposing 300kb blocks to """decentralise the network""" further, because apparently downloading a few gigs of data is too much in 2019 to secure the most secure ledger ever.
@_date: 2019-07-21 18:11:17
It's not work, but it's risk.
@_date: 2019-07-18 16:29:18
My fee (which is apparently quite high for LN) was 0.05%, or 0.0005/1, of what I sent. It's right there on the screen.
@_date: 2019-07-18 19:18:21
Miners are competing to find any nonce below the difficulty value. The lower the difficultly value goes, the harder it is to find a block!
@_date: 2019-07-14 16:51:29
Let's not get ahead of ourselves
@_date: 2019-07-14 16:33:25
is absolutely SEETHING over this post
@_date: 2019-07-14 16:53:16
You can spend funds you receive through lightning, so the merchant receives 0.2btc and can buy groceries from his nearest store that accepts lightning instantly. No need to ever go onchain.
@_date: 2019-07-09 21:58:53
Receiving payment for things from overseas when trading identities isn't necessary; for example, mundane work I do for others for bitcoin (which pays better than my job!) while at my undemanding day job.
@_date: 2019-07-14 17:21:32
Other wallets do show the value in satoshis. This is the most technically elaborate one, being noncustodial.
Edit: Turns out I missed a setting and you can do it in satoshis
@_date: 2019-07-18 17:23:52
Apparently! I couldn't wait to get going, so my own node isn't ready yet, and now I'm being told I could've picked a cheaper node! Ah well.
@_date: 2019-07-09 12:07:48
The internet can still be accessed in Venezuela, so you're unlikely to run into additional double spend issues using Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-07-14 10:59:05
Inaccurate. You can also use lightning totally noncustodially.
@_date: 2019-11-11 12:26:28
LOL, layer 2 isn't even complete yet, and most business transactions use only layer 1
@_date: 2019-08-19 18:59:28
You're about to be scammed, I've seen this one countless times. Try googling the exchange, and notice how it doesn't come up.
@_date: 2019-08-26 09:38:51
Don't use a blockchain wallet. If you want to sweep a paper wallet, use a good wallet like Electrum (where you can set your own fees) or a decent mobile wallet at least where you can set your own fees, like Coinomi, BRD.
@_date: 2019-08-22 05:38:45
Liquid is an embarrassing joke. It's effectively Libra, but ran by the Bitcoin exchange cartel instead of a cartel of major companies. It's good for exchanges to settle between one another, but is not censorship resistant, P2P or permissionless like Bitcoin/Lightning.
@_date: 2019-08-25 15:33:42
What is this a reference to?
@_date: 2019-08-13 19:54:07
It's called a paper wallet.
@_date: 2019-08-24 20:48:37
If it deflates at a rate of about 0.1% or less a year (lost coins), while the Swiss Franc routinely deflates over 1% and inflates to aim for 0% inflation...I think we'll be fine.
@_date: 2019-08-11 15:20:14
Bitcoin is a currency. Without people spending bitcoin, there would be no real-world adoption. The lightning network exists SPECIFICALLY to allow easier bitcoin spending. If you really think bitcoin is the future, which many of us do, you can top up your bitcoin with fiat.
@_date: 2019-08-22 11:58:46
You're really clutching at straws when you try to argue a permissioned atomic swap is totally different to a permissioned bank deposit
@_date: 2019-08-23 19:22:08
I'd like to buy some, can you accept BTC lightning pls? Thank. I know coinpayments allows it
@_date: 2019-08-25 16:46:05
Damn, I didn't know that. It's not an equivalent risk to have port 8333 open on Bitcoin core?
@_date: 2019-10-29 16:39:20
What is the point of lightning then if we can just use coinbase to hold our money?
@_date: 2019-08-22 11:52:17
Libra's supply is pegged to fiat currencies. There's no difference. Liquid federation can reject your unpeg and keep your coins if they so choose. It's embarrassing and should be decried.
@_date: 2019-08-20 11:38:55
More people using Dogecoin than nano to pay bills
Edit: In fairness, they don't even accept nano lmao
@_date: 2019-10-22 21:04:03
Blast Galaxy takes bitcoin? Is this true?
@_date: 2019-08-20 14:52:57
Although some taxation is little more than forced charity, which could cause a conflict of interest, people aren't inherently worth less because they have less money. That's a strange and disturbing road to go down.
@_date: 2019-10-15 13:12:02
Probably not, but your seed words engraved in metal could
@_date: 2019-08-22 19:54:23
I hope you kept a copy of their keys for yourself! It's like a gift from them to you when they lose it and it's appreciated in value!
@_date: 2019-08-13 19:49:20
Tfw you get cucked by Roger ver
@_date: 2019-08-19 09:27:23
Yes, I donated over Lightning to BTC Venezuela
@_date: 2019-08-23 19:54:56
Cheers! I can't wait to have my first shitcoin :)
Edit: Do you have a contract address I can use to add it to my ETH wallet?
@_date: 2019-06-17 16:02:34
Nice, I signed up. Looking forward to indebting you!
What is the leverage though?
@_date: 2019-09-19 09:33:58
The market wills the federal funds rate, and interest rates in general, to not be so artificially low. This additional liquidity fuels malinvestment.
@_date: 2019-09-11 17:46:21
Try sweeping it into Coinomi by typing in your private key :) make sure to back up your seed!
@_date: 2019-09-11 15:21:20
What is a checksum?
@_date: 2019-09-02 10:22:40
Difference is it incentivises retailers to accept Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-09-09 20:04:34
Can't run a lightning node without an unpruned full archival node.
@_date: 2019-09-13 15:12:45
Probably easier than finding 350K a year

What exactly is BIP70?
