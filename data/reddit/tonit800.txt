You are an idiot. How are you imagining this to work?
Lets say you boss sends you 1000$ in BTC in the evening. You go sleep, wake up next day and Bitcoin fall by 10 % (which happens regularly). Now you only have 900 $. 
Next try to pay all the bills: electricity, social security, medical insurance, apartment and so on. For his you will have to convert BTC back to normal money. What about daily life? Like buying food, buying coffee, paying for gas ? You will eventually need to use real money. 
I  really  dont know why are you so happy.

Banks invest millions in a state of the art cybersecurity. Big banks have dedicated team of high qualified IT guys, which monitor the system 24/7. The chance of a bank being hacket is MUCH lower than a common user PC with a free anti virus software on it.
How many people on Earth will have a problem with sending 100 millions on weekends? 0.0000000001% of population? Wtf are you talking about?
I like my bank : its card is accepted everywhere I go. The payment is done quickly in just 5 seconds. I pay around 30€ per quarter for my account, which is nothing in comparison to the service I get.

Business owners spending 100 Mil. Dollars surely dong give a single fuck if a money transfer takes a day more. It is normal day in the office to them.


Here, in Germany, 120 € a year is nothing for anyone with a job (Hell, even as a student, 120 € was a tiny sum to me).
 Furthermore the bank fees are adjusted according to the economical status of the country.  In Russia, for example, a bank account cost around 1500 Rubles (25 €) a year.


That would be unfortunate and cause some problems. But the probability for it are minuscule, similar to a chance of being hit by lighting during rain. I will take a risk.


The chance of government stealing my money is so low, that I would rather store my money in a bank than in bitcoins, which can lose half of its value overnight.

Every service has a price.
@_date: 2019-07-01 17:26:29


Have you? I highly doubt it


Yes, but their security system is far more advanced than Avira Free Edition. Moreover with increasing adoption of BTC the amount of attacks on simple users will also increase. 


You didn't got the point. It is not about the day of a week, it is about the sum of 100 Millions €. How many people will ever  transfer so much money? And if they do, I assure you, they dont give a fuck if it takes a day longer or not.


It is done for me, and for the shop I  used it in. The rest happens in the background and is not important.
And honestly, 120 € per year is nothing. Once again, I am paying for service: security, reliability, convenience and what is even more important for customer service, in case something is wrong with my account. If someone just stole all you saving from BTC wallet in front of your eyes, what you are going to do? Complain on reddit? Right? Noone will help you, you are on your own.
If someone steals my savings from my bank account, I can always contact the 24/7 support, freeze my account and get my money back.
All of this is worth 120€ for me.

They can easily shut it down by implementing stricter rules for banks. If buying btc will result into ban of your bank account, people will stop using btc.
Government can easily ban btc machines and btc advertisements of any kind (or make it 18+, like gambling) . Government can easily prohibit taking btc as payment because of "tax traceability" .

Well, I think banks dont want to deal with bitcoin simply because it is a big pain in the ass for them. A lot of frauds are happening through crypto lately, and a bank just dont want to be part of it. Imagine dealing with police, with enraged customer which account has been hacked and all money retrieved through BTC, etc. Like, every time the shit will hit the fan, the bank will have to invest own resources to deal with it. Sure, there are some normal  people who use bitcoin in honest, legal way, but i guess the odds are just against BTC right now.

I prefer stable value over this, lets say very rare inconvenience, when I want to by something for more than 20k€. Lets be honest, this is not happening to you monthly or maybe even yearly, right?

Life is a gamble, and it is all about probabilities. Lets take euros in my German bank. Sure there is a chance of a hack, of a ww3, chance that the EU and German economy will collapse etc. But these chances are way less than the chances of BTC to crash by 90% or even dissappear. Therefore I choose the less of two evils and trust in real money.
If I want to gamble, I would rather play lottery or poker. If I want to invest, I would do it by buying stocks of MS, Amazon, SpaceX etc.

Inflation has nothing to do with btc price which just jumps up or down by 10% overnight. Inflation is constant at around 1—2 % a year. Moreover in normal countries your salary is corrected at the end of the year to compensate it.
@_date: 2019-08-06 20:10:32


Bitcoin is pure gamble controlled by a few entities. It is even worse than inflation, because with inflation you know exactly what to expect, while with BTC you just have to hope it will not go down by 50% exactly when you need it.
Moreover BTC future is not clear. It can disappear exactly as it has appeared and in 10 years people will remember it as some kind of 2015 retro thingy, like VHS or CD today.

Bitcoin is too volatile to use in normal daily life. I would like to sometimes use BTC as a substitute  for PayPal for example.

@_date: 2019-10-01 08:33:59
Bitcoin transaction require network connectivity and electricity. Fiat dont.
Bitcoin transactions require long confirmation time, Fiat is instant.
Bitcoin transactions require fee. No fee for fiat payments.
Bitcoin is much less private than fiat. Once people know my main wallet adress, they can track every transaction I make. Cash, on the other hand leaves no trace. I just give someone 10000€ pack, he puts it in his pocket, done. 
Bitcoin is probably is even more centralized than fiat.
All in all, very stupod and biased illustration.

It is not always about science, many things are obvious, even though there is no hard proof for it.

The process you have described (printing money and decreasing USD value) is so slow, that it is not relevant for any given person, since we live just 70-80 years.
For a regular citizen, inflation is so slow, that it almost not there. Especially because many employers increase your salary yearly , to compensate inflation (more or less).

Not really misery. It just feels right for BTC to go  down. It has no value:
Other people work, bake bread, teach, in other words contribute to society. In return they get money, wich they can exchange for goods and services.
But what about BTC? A bunch of people sitting at home, burning electricity and doing useless calculations. In return they get money without contributing. It just dont feel right. Moreover, when I see how many stupid cryptofanatics are there who think that tax are bad and banks are evil. They honestly deserve the misery. 
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:59:23
No bias, simple logic.
The sudden rise from 3-5k  to 13.5k is no natural. It is not how adoption works. Nothing special has happened in this time frame to justify the price spike.
Therefore I conclude, that someone  is simply controlling the bitcoin price. Why do they do it? Of course for profit. How can they profit from it? By pumping the price up to the moon and then selling the huge amount of coins at higher prices until the price hits the ground again.

No problem, call the bank, talk to real person, your card will be frozen and money returned. Got scammed? No problem, call the bank, explain your case, initiate charge back. You have hard time and need a big amount of money? No problem, bank will give it to you. That is the service you dont get with btc.
Is your wallet hacked and you lost all your money, noone will help you.  You was scammed? Noone will help you. Did you sent btc to wrong address? Well, noone will help you.
You clearly not a smart one, as I can see you are also using DMT, that explains a lot...

Even if the infation rate of your country's currency is a few percent per year, it is still much more reliable than bitcoin, which can lose 80% of its value in just a week. 
Sure, the price is climbing now and people are positive, or almost euphoric. But the volatility of the BTC makes it the worst ever medium to store savings.
I want my saving to be rather secure in a bank, than in hands of a few entities who control the btc price.

Are you really comparing xmas light which consumes few Wh with crypto farms? Seriously? 
Visa charging you 3% is bullshit. My bank takes just few cents per transaction and it is ok, since they offer a service to securely and conveniently store my money.

Saving on the long run doesn't make much sense to me. What if shit hits fan in real life and you will need at least a part of your savings by the end of the week and unfortunately the bitcoin price is very low?
You cant just wait for months until it recovers, you will have to sell btc and take loses.
And even for a long run it is still very risky. Cryptocurrency is a new technology and no one knows what will happen to it in 5-10 years.

Have you never been on fairs or other events will a lot of people? Have you noticed that people accept only cash there? That is because it is much quicker to process payements with cash. 
What about 2nd/3rd word countries? Where not everyone has Iphone or even internet connection?
Hell, even here, in Germany, many farmers jut drive to our town with their crop and sell it for cash because they are not tech savy and because it it easy. Try to explain them that they now have to buy hardware, configure software, manage wallet etc...

That is cherry picking. Only a few people can allow themselves to be drug addicted and be in a good menthal/health shape. You have to be very rich for that. 
If you are from mid/low class, once you are addicted, you most likely lose your job, end up on streets without money or shelter etc.

That is a major disadvantage of bitcoin. Banks offer much better security for your money and customer support.

"Explain, please."
What do I have to explain here? Dont you need a connection to the blockchain in order to perform and verify a transaction?
"-confirmation times are "days" for the current banking system, not just 10+ minutes
-fees must be paid for the current banking system
No fees and 0 second confirmation required if you use cash.
Moreover,  no one waits for the bank confirmation if you pay with your credit card. There is also zero confirmation time if I pay per PayPal: one click and done.
"Today's fiat currencies are mostly just bits in computers"-no they are not. I can walk to my bank tomorrow (or even today) and withdraw all my money as cash, no problem with that. 
I see you also didn't write anything about security and service you have with banks, but dont with BTC. Why so? Do you have nothing to say to these very important points?

Oh, the beauty of new independent hipster cryptocurrency. Right?
In a bank no one will ever really steal your money, you will always have access to them and if something goes wrong there will be very prompt and competent service to recover your money. 
But using BTC you are on your own, no one will help you.

Yep. But if you find yourself in an area without electricity and internet, you can always pay with cash, cant you?
But in case of a bitcoin, it is not possible. You will always need a connection to the blockchain (directly or not).
@_date: 2019-05-03 14:09:39
Well, firstly, a Dark net market is also a place for seller with stolen private data, cp, and other illegal stuff. That is why it is good that it is closed now. I also dont get your point of  50y old drug war. Sure you cant catch them all, but it doesnt mean that you cant keep the situation under control.
"Why do you think drugs are bad?"-are you fucking kidding me right now? Seriously?
My (ex)GF was a social worker she told me many heart breaking stories about young people getting addicted, selling everything, burning every bridge or even violently killing innocents just to get another dose. How many people have died because of OD? I repeatedly see potheads here, in Germany, just hanging out on the streets, sitting on the neck of our social security and dont contribute to society anyhow.  Ironically, such potheads are the ones who are criticizing our social system the most...
Drug is cause for death,crime and hopeless ghettos where kids starting taking meth at the age of 12.

It still requires electricity, internet connection and hardware that is able to read its content (or how else a seller can see how much money does it have).
As to the LN:  I guess there are reason why not everyone is using LN right now.

Neither me nor my friends and family member have ever experienced problems with withdrawing money. Maybe because we are not millionaires, but for the case of 6+ digit number people just keep their money in different banks.   Of course thre are cases of banks going bankrupt and not able to return money but in my knowledge it happens only to small bank with suspiciously high interest rates etc, where there is clearly something fishy. Big banks will never have problem to give you your money.


And honestly I cant see the lack of security and customer service as advantage.


Since banks have very secure system, the probability of my PC being hacked is much higher then bank's servers. I think my money is definitely more secure on my account then on my laptops wallet.


Sure the current economy system and the idea of printing money is not the best, but  maybe it is what society needs to prosper. Maybe by stopping the money printer we will reach stagnation? How about that?
@_date: 2019-05-18 17:46:36

Oh, I beg you. Stop repeating this bullshit. Even though there is yearly inflation (which was proven many times to be beneficial for economy), the value goes down so slowly, that it is irrelevant for my lifetime.
Moreover, look at the BTC stability, or better to say the lack of it. Today it is up by 30%, tomorrow it will go down by 50% . 
BTC is not  better than "evil" banks since its price lies in the hand of a few rich anonymous people who may decide to dump the price by 90% next week.Surely you can plan ahead with BTC, right....

Alcohol or gambling do not destroy your methal and physical health as fast as meth or coke... They are also notas  nearly addictive.
I can get myself drunk with vodka or rum, and feel shit the next day. But that is it. If I take some heavy drug instead, it is most likely melt my brain and I will do everything for a fix.
How can you say the state does nothing to address such people?
Here, in  Europe, they have everything. They get free medical help if they need one, they get free (paid by government) shelter, food etc. They can even go into rehab (for free! ) if they want to.
Dont want rehab, fine.. The government will give you daily money so you can buy your fix and don't have steal/rob. Some countries even have special places, where addicts get cleat syringes and heroin...
What else can state do?

@_date: 2019-05-03 15:06:01
This would explain your position. My (ex)GF has mentioned many times that drug addicts  are always blaming the system and not the drugs. The is the main problem. You have to make them understand the real issue before they can successfully pass through rehabilitation and  start living a normal life.

Especially because it is a reasonable dose, MDMA has to be controlled very strictly and prescribed ONLY to people diagnosed with severe depression or other psychological problems, or else every teenager going through puberty will eat MDMA just because he thinks he is depressed...
And for MDMA to be allowed  a long way of research has to be done, so it can be viewed as medication.

Oh, cmon. Teenagers rarely use their brain. They just want to do crazy/adult stuff to look cool and experiment. I got my  first vodka shot behind th eschool when I was 12 or something. SO are my classmates. But vodka is not as impactful on someones brain as , lets say heroin. If it was heroin, I and my friends would most likely have become addicts and ruin our life.


That is why it is called addiction.  Normal brain can be happy from a walk  in park or listening to music, but addicted brain has its chemistry screwed up, and therefore can only be happy with heavy drugs.


Yes they are, but only in VERY low, controllable dose. I guess the dosage would be too low for a "normal" drug user.

Bitcoin requires electricity and constant internet connection. Confirmation times are very long: 10+ min. You have to pay fee for every transaction.  
Your money are purely virtual, which make them very vulnerable. If your wallet got hacked, lost or stolen, it is over. Same if you got scammed or just made a typo in the receiving address.
On the contrary : cash is easy to use, quick, requires no internet connection or electricity. The bank secures your money and is always there to help if something bad happens (it is called service). Someone stole or hacked your card? No worries, just call the 24H support, and they will freeze the account and secure the money. Made a wrong transaction? No big deal, just call the service. Got hacked? No worries, the bank can help even there if you react quickly. 
I prefer security and convince  over nerdy money
