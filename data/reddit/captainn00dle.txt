This update suggests that both cash AND bitcoin is missing, and doesn't specify if the assets and liabilities includes BTC losses in that figure; BTC would count as an asset right?

Physical Bitcoins do exist e.g. casascius.com where the private key hidden on the hologram

It appears that they've taken the website down, even though I didn't get a reply to my support ticket.

Bitcoin-24 credited my account €231, and had I not mentioned it, they would have happily let me spend it on their exchange.

In the bitcoin world you need to research before sending. This rule applies to everything.

Thanks, you can generate custom addresses in a similar way to bitcoin mining (similar not the same).
There are online places to do it too!
But I use vanitygen:

Agreed, if you said "this" it would sound like you were calling your maths into question, not the 90 day period.

I have both bought and sold on [BitBargain]( I would recommend it for getting coins quickly in the UK. It is a market place, not an exchange, with a variety of different payment methods available.

WAIT A SECOND.
You've got a custom address for the website, of course you know about it.
I'll just pretend that this post was for other interested people =)

I just bought it for 0.0395 BTC

You posted the private key and someone got the coins before you did?
Is not big suprise.

I did, and I like it, the animations of the coin spinning on the background is a little over the top for me..
What happens when there is only one person in the pot?
I'm still waiting for my silly transactions to confirm (13 hours now)

Thanks for the answer! Good explanation =)
I'd tip if I could =)

Thank you, I enjoyed reading this article.

It says 1btc to me, I think you have to login.

Apparently it includes LS/S orders too, they have the "long boards" now.

Open up your computer, your motherboard looks like just like this "jalapeño". You've been had.

This looks like a good idea.
Lets get it working in the UK
Also, there is no information on fees/exchange rates!

I get coins by using Transferwise and Bitcoin-24, but that's shut down temporarily, so I need a replacement! But this method takes 2-3 days!

Ah, thanks for the reply, I've heard of mining-pool hopping (where people constantly switch pools to the one with the best 'rate' at the time), and I know that there are ways of overcoming that.
I just wondered if this was a different thing.
@_date: 2013-04-21 13:13:23
I reported it as abuse to their webhost too, it'll probably be taken down soon, I'll post their reply here.
@_date: 2013-04-04 16:10:11
Did you send payment, did you get the code?
@_date: 2013-05-06 11:29:34
One "bitcoin" does not exist.
What exists is a record of how many bitcoins each person owns (a running total).
Each person knows that they are the only person who can spend those coins because they have the right password.
What gives bitcoins their value is that everyone in the community agrees how many coins people have and can look up which people have how many coins. (If you imagine each person has a bitcoin 'address'.)
Hope I helped.
