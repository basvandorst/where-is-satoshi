Last week, the two largest crypto VISA cards currently in the US (Bitpay and Coinbase  Shift) announced they were unexpectedly closing accounts. Both of these cards were issued by Metropolitan Commercial Bank (MCB), which announced last year they would also be issuing the MCO VISA card as well. Now [Crypto.com]( CMO Sean Rach has announced on Discord that the MCB compliance issues with Bitpay / Coinbase Shift cards DO NOT affect the upcoming [Crypto.com]( MCO card launch in the US. Looks like [Crypto.com]( is about to pick up a lot of orphaned Bitpay and Coinbase Shift users! Good news for the MCO token, currently up 25%+ for the week at CMC!
