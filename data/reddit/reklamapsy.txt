You find SMPC not secure? Can you explain why?

The idea is to replace the private key from the system with N number of secrets, which will be stored on the behalf of parties you chose (can be any device: PC, phone, watches, software wallet, hardware biometric wallet) and to perform any actions with funds K-of-N parties must interact. Only the coins owner can perform actions with funds - other parties only store their partial secrets and can't get access to money. If one of the parties will be compromised (even if it will be owner's device), the malicious actor still won't be able to get the access to funds - he will need to compromise all devices with secrets simultaneously. These tech is called Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC).
The biometry will be used to generate these secrets each time you want to perform any action with funds (so no images of it will be stored in the device). 
It sounds similair to multi-sig, but SMPC: 
* blockchain agnostic (works with any coin), while multi-sig works only with some coins;
* works with any addresses, while multi-sig works only with a special type;
* is faster as it off-chain, while multi-sig is on-chain;
* works perfectly with dApps and DeFi services, while multi-sig doesn't support them.  
So SMPC is more like successor of private keys.

I will cover the subject in details in the next two articles.

I think Satoshi would not agree with you. Bitcoin was created as the solution to the financial crysis 2008. To save money of all people around the world - not a few that could understand the technology.
All technologies are going through the stage of the polishing (can take as evolving) to become convenient to use by mass audience. Phones - smartphones, typewriters - laptops/smartphones, etc.
The tech is adopting to people - not people to tech.
And if you want, you can not use the biometry - just generate secrets from any other device. It's still will be secure solution.
UPD: yes, the development began earlier, but Bitcoin's whitepaper was released in the fever of the financial crysis. So it can be taken as a proposed solution.

Haven't knew about downward adjustment. Thank you.

I'm not trying to spread FUD - i'm just asking reasonable questions. 
Thank you for the video, anyway.

You think someone can mine at loss for one year (for example)?

I'd better keep my digital cash in my pocket.

How many miners got into Bitcoin because of its idea (not for profit)? Epecially in 2017.
