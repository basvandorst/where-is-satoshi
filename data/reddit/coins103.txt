If network voting could technically lead to a proposed implementation becoming Bitcoin, then it is on topic. 
Makes sense.

I'm pretty sure Gavin was doing his best to keep the dev work motoring along and going on road trips to get the word out when Bitcoin was like &lt;$3m market cap, up to &gt; $8bn market cap.

I think its simpler than that. Believing in something is great, but it doesn't pay the bills. He probably spent a great deal of time on lots of things he believed in and there is only so much you can do or projects you can support when rent day is always looming around the corner. 
Still, how many tens of thousands of Bitcoins could he have mined with a CPU by the time Gavin got on board? Not sure how he sleeps, to be honest.
@_date: 2016-01-25 01:14:49
Exactly. Bitcoin is a stateless currency.
@_date: 2016-01-19 01:47:55
It's almost like trying to leave the Mafia. Once you're in, you're in for life. 
Probably a mistake to go to town with the whole Bitcoin has failed thing, time will tell I guess. 
Just set-up a noob account and contribute as and when you feel the urge to keep your hand in. 
Best of luck with the new job (seriously, good luck); I reckon the banks need you more than you need them. Talk about a failed project ;)

I still love the story, as told by Adam, that he never thought Bitcoin would gain traction and he finally gave up that position and bought his first Bitcoin for $180; when he could have been mining the hell out of Bitcoin using his CPU pretty much from the launch of the genesis block.
@_date: 2016-11-19 19:45:24
I think it's Ver's central issue. 
I'm sure you can convince him why he is mistaken.

They are less than 10% of the network. SegWit is at around 25% adoption. 
Don't you mean, 'fuck all you 75% majority of miners', rather than picking on one minority?
@_date: 2016-11-07 23:13:32
Source? 
@_date: 2016-12-08 20:42:54
Wait until miners reach around 80% SegWit soft fork adoption, then try again.
@_date: 2016-12-13 23:35:53
What does a 'compromise' look like? half BU half Core?
@_date: 2016-11-25 00:26:50
Why didn't you wait for LN?
@_date: 2016-11-13 19:40:34
This is one of the issues a Bitcoin Foundation would have been good for.
@_date: 2016-12-02 21:38:39
What is it with segwit taken into account?
@_date: 2016-11-19 14:04:32
But you really need to balance your own view of the situation, too.




If the 1mb limit was a temporary measure, then surely BU is a proposal to unlock that temporary measure.
I'd rather Core was the single point of focus, but, there are differing views on the issue of scaling. Locking out the discussions on the 1mb issue is the problem that r/btc people seem to be trying to campaign against. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 00:15:48
I'm pretty sure there is a whitepaper that talks about miners voting...something like 'one CPU, one vote.' It's voting.
@_date: 2016-12-22 01:44:19
In that case, whats the point of voting on anything?
@_date: 2016-02-02 15:11:30
So I posed the question - 'what's not to like?' And then you gave me an answer. 
@_date: 2016-02-06 22:51:27
PayPal ad is a joke. Everyone should complain about their ad because it is misleading. 
'New Money'? Err, no. Some fiat money, different way to get fleeced. 
Bitcoin IS new money. 
@_date: 2016-02-02 14:49:13
So I up voted, why not? What's not to like? :-)
@_date: 2016-02-02 16:27:10
Too much information, dude. 
Keep that sort of thing to yourself, please. 
@_date: 2016-02-13 10:47:02
100% agree; BUT. Regulators have been searching for ways to raid banks for $billions to give themselves bonuses. If you go after bankers, you get zero payout. Go after banks and you get a pay rise. 
Regulators are just as crooked.

A lot of alts and now Inc. issued tokens will eventually get traded into Bitcoin. So this is sort of a good thing. 
Should have just done a straight Bitcoin integration to save the users a load of hassle.
@_date: 2016-09-05 17:56:37
Please interview the dev of Spreadcoin, which is a project trying to use altcoins to increase the number of Bitcoin full nodes by paying people to run full Bitcoin nodes.
A great project to show how altcoins can contribute to supporting Bitcoin's growth and use in areas of the world where there are very few full Bitcoin nodes.
@_date: 2016-09-10 20:22:42
Isn't that sort of the point of encouraging adoption; hitting far higher transactions per second than we have at present?
@_date: 2016-09-10 20:06:52
What happens if everyone caps, but we see a bigger blockchain, fewer full nodes and a significant uptick in users? 
We'll hit bandwidth capacity issues.

Big important issue.
This guy was showing 438.91 GiB in a month, when the blockchain was around 60GB. 
There was another guy (can't find post at this time) who had double that.
Another guy: My node with 51 connections, up time January 25, used 25gb upload
What will be the bandwidth in 4 years, with fewer full nodes (numbers are still falling) and much bigger blockchain?
A recent discussion on Bitcointalk: 
@_date: 2016-09-08 02:31:06
Nicely thought out. 
But without full nodes (regardless of coin flavor) serving up data, the decentralized bit doesn't work very well. 
Please support the new Bitcoin full node incentives work.  No one wants your money, just your support to make it happen. 
Otherwise, this is all just centralized finance 2.0

Computers and The internet were invented by British guys, too. 
It's only natural that Bitcoin was a British invention. Besides, the whitepaper has some British grammar. You'd need to have had a British education to know these things. Oh, and his post history was surprisingly biased towards GMT.
@_date: 2016-10-29 00:19:59
Sounds like a hard fork would have been better and cleaner to get segwit implemented.

I've been to Nelson on holiday. Great country. 
The genesis block was mined at 6pm. That would be 6am in NZ. 
Pretty sure Satoshi wouldn't stay up to 6am when there was no pressure to launch. 
Sorry to burst your bubble, but he ain't an All Black. 
@_date: 2016-10-03 18:03:47
Satoshi made reference to The Times newspaper, the UK edition, in the Genesis block. 
Set it to GMT. You'll be glad you made a historically accurate adjustment.
@_date: 2016-10-03 17:33:27
But Satoshi is British, times should be GMT.

People who are seeders are actually a very small percentage of the BitTorrent ecosystem, so downloading is really slow.
Paying people to seed means the quality of downloading and more likely the opportunity to get great streaming services will make you wonder why limit yourself to Netflix, when the choices for expanded content are far greater on Torrent services.

Actually, I said a group of us have a solid proposal. 
And. 
If other people got into groups and thought about different ideas, then perhaps one of the proposals might work. 
We have a white paper in which we went out of our way to write about 40 pages to demonstrate that we do understand the issues. Now if you read the white paper and then say it's silly naval gazing, that would be different than just dismissing a proposal to solve a problem that everyone says can't be solved. Perhaps it can't be solved because people don't bother to read proposals. 
here for ease of reference:
