Honestly, I'm pretty satisfied with it that, everytime the price goes up makes me just as nervous as when the price goes down.  Having it stabilize means that it'll be easier to actually use as currency, and IMO that's a good thing.

I think the biggest point is that they hold a monopoly, which means they can completely screw with everything and the people have no alternative, yes they CAN resort to violence, but it is hardly needed because until recently you didn't have any choice but to use their currency.

While I agree with you that mtgox is an important issue, as well as others, I don't think they will be the death knell of Bitcoin,  I believe the key to lasting stability would be the adoption by online retailers like Amazon.

Not sure why this is such a surprise, just because someone has bitcoin doesn't mean it affects their habits. Don't get me wrong it is pretty depressing, just not really that surprising.

I understand, I was simply pointing out another facet of their control, because if people have nothing else to use, because you have made all other currency illegal, they are going to use the only one that's left.

Why are Coinbase wallets looked down upon?Is there something about it that makes it less secure than others? Or is it just the fact that it is an online wallet?
