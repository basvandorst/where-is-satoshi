The reason I was screening with it is because a mobile wallet failed spectacularly but it only had one address with a balance and it was using some weird derivation path different than electrum. It seemed the quickest easiest way to deal with it was to get the private key. It also wasn’t a very high balance.

There must be some scenarios. For example, what if you want to publish a deposit/donation address on printed materials?  Or how about a case where you need to make periodic deposits to a cold storage address where there is no good way to communicate new deposit addresses to use after each and every transaction?

But why would you assume they need to immediately move all the new purchases into the same address or known addresses? That would be stupid and also not in accordance  with the recommended usage of bitcoin which is to never reuse addresses and to create new single use addresses for every transaction. You would only be able to track the new purchases if the buyers went out of their way to consolidate all purchases into a single or small number of addresses and/or reused addresses which is exactly the last thing in the world anyone would do that doesn’t want to make it easy to track and analyze their activity.

@_date: 2019-06-12 09:56:26
No the reference standard is to use a new address for every transaction so you would only be able to know what you paid and you already know that. Of course if they sweep all payments to a single address after you pay you could know but that’s not something a merchant has to do and even if they did it wouldn’t be 100% clear that that is in fact what they are doing.

Oh yea... I forgot, mining millions of dollars worth of bitcoins is something you can easily do in your garage with a laptop.
What happens when they ask about your hardware purchases? Your electric bill? Where all these mining machines are. Etc.
Also it’s pretty easy to analyze the blockchain to see that the bitcoins you claimed you mined were not recently mined but purchased else.
This would in fact be one of the dumbest ways to attempt to launder money.

Either that’s really lucky or my understanding of how it works is wrong. I thought without RBF enabled no honest miner will take it if it’s in the mempool. That said I think miners set their own mempool parameters and I guess if it was days old it could have dropped out of the mempool of some miners (especially if it had really low fee) and you got lucky and reached one of those?
