Oh come on, a full presidential pardon? He did knowingly violate laws that were already in place. I'd agree for a severely reduced punishment of only a couple of years, but a presidential pardon for Ulbricht is far less likely than Snowden getting pardoned.

I read this brief article about the energy usage for Bitcoin. While it is a lot, its not as bad as you might think when you read about the 2nd to last paragraph in this article. Basically, comparatively we don't use THAT much since there are a lot of technologies that use a lot of energy too (e.g. iPads, phones, etc.) But so long as Bitcoin retains some value to people it'll be worth it.
I mean, if you think about it we as a society won't always be relying on fossil fuels for power. Eventually we'll start relying on alternative sources of energy so the environmental impact will be almost none. Honestly, I don't think the energy thing is that big of an issue.
Side note: I hate interacting with Redditors outside of Bitcoin related subs. They're so misinformed and immutable to changing the perceptions about Bitcoin that it's a waste of breath to convince them otherwise.

I think on the Bitcoin.org page it says you should run a full node if your computer is on for at least 8 hours a day and can support the bandwidth. That should be true for a lot of people. I just found it hard to download the blockchain. The torrent I stumbled across said that as of Core 0.10 the software actually fetched the blockchain faster than the torrent but the torrent was much faster for me.

Yeah, you should really put expanded descriptions if you want people to hire you. There are a lot of competitors out there. This isn't the 90s. You can't just say look at all this shit I've made and think that's enough to get them to contact you. You should have competitive marketing; what services do you offer that others don't?

That's the kind of thinking that declines company profits and impedes or destroys their success. A company should try to retain all their users. Word of mouth travels fast.

I have a couple of loans and 0 late payments. Only thing I worry about is BTC JAM shutting down and taking all my coins.
@_date: 2015-05-05 07:52:32
But if a fiat currency changes price that price change isn't readily apparent to the user.  Like,  if I see that my bank balance is $100 then that value will not change as I see it thoroughout the day.  It'll be $100 today, tomorrow, the next day, and so on. Now, the cost of the things around me may increase or whatever in relation to that value and the value of the currency may decrease but I won't see that happen everyday. I feel like that is a big barrier to overcome for anyone. Even if the value of Bitcoin doesn't fluctuate as much as adoption increases, even a small change in your daily balance might seem concerning.

Locking away such important information behind a pay wall is detrimental to progress and research.

When I got introduced to Bitcoin through a Udemy course, also available on iTunes I think, the presenter recommended that you not put more than 1% of your annual income into Bitcoin because it was a highly volatile investment.

I don't know about this. I have Verizon FiOS and I used to download Gigabytes of porn unprotected by a VPN and never once for a copyright infringement notice. The only reason I switched to a VPN was because my torrent software was seeding a porn video in the background (by accident) at school and they got an infringement notice and traced it to me. This is as bad as it sounds because I had to meet with some school official and he started off by explaining the dangers of torrenting, pirating, etc. and he finished with "now I'm going to give you the name of the file that this infringement is in regards to...". At that time I was like, " please don't be that bad, please don't be that bad". And it wasn't too bad actually, the name of the video was "Tori Black Is Pretty Filthy XXX"; that's not as bad as other porn videos that title their files. Thank god the official wasn't female, that would've been way too much awkwardness for me to handle; I would've exploded. I think I might have a porn addiction. Matter of fact..

Personally, I wouldn't buy a Trezor because I'm confident in my ability to handle my coins securely. First, don't put them all in one place. Second, only put as much in a wallet as you can afford to lose if something were to happen. So that being said, I think Trezor is a bit overpriced for something that has been available for free for a long time (wallets not hardware wallets). If you're careful then it shouldn't matter if you buy a hardware wallet or not.

I would honestly say no. Right now Bitcoin is spiking upwards and you'd be buying high. You want to buy when the price is low. imo, it's artificially inflating right now because people want free money with the upcoming Bitcoin fork.
I know it's only $15. But I think you should still wait for it to dip in price after the fork.  If it doesn't, then you wouldn't have taken much of a loss on the potential gain between now and then if Bitcoin doesn't drop.
More importantly, if we're talking about Coinbase then you won't be able to purchase Bitcoin directly because they have a min amount of Bitcoin you must want to buy and $15 won't cover it. You might have to buy litecoin and then sell it for btc; havent tried this myself so I'm not sure if the restriction would exist for BTC/LTC.

It's still convoluted. Last time I placed an order for a gift card it was rejected because my social accounts weren't linked yet and it told me to wait 2 hours. This error occurs at the last step of the checkout process so if you're a new user (at least this was my experience) then you'll have to wait. In the end I just said fuck it and didn't order the Gyft card. 10/10 would not use again based on the initial experience alone.

I understand, but .NET 5 really is a complete departure from previous versions of .NET and comparable to performance to other common web programming backend languages; it should actually remove the problems you mentioned about process and thread creation.

What's the point of gathering all this Bitcoin and just letting it sit? You might as well let your money do work for you by investing portions of it in small exchanges or something like BTCJam. That way you'll earn some interest. It just seems like that's a better way to go about investing in Bitcoin; invest your investment kinda thing. Of course, you'd only invest what you're comfortable losing but since you're already investing in Bitcoin you should already be aware of how volatile of an investment it is.
