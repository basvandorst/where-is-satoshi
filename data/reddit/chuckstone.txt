I wonder what would happen if you placed a BTC graph overlay against this one.
If the value of fiat currency collapses..  because it's fiat, and the US dollar, being the currency to back all currencies, goes down in value... All other currencies would be affected by similar devaluing forces. Which is fine, because all value is relative ... 
But then, Bitcoin arrives and establishes a new point of comparison. 
My point is, not only is BitCoin rising in value... It appears to be rising in value because everything else is falling away.

I doubt China would make that mistake.
They are like a spider in the middle of an economic web and shifting *towards* the gold standard effectively destroys a powerful mechanism for a government to be able to manipulate the economy. 
The Gold Standard was an essential part of the development of an economic system. But that phase passed a long time ago, and any nostalgic attempts to revert to a less advanced economic system have historically been mistakes.
The Phillipine economy since 1997 is a perfect example why. I mean, the tourism and service industry should help the country stay afloat even though their currency has been collapsing consistently for about 100 years. (As gold backed currencies often do, when paired against fiat). Lets just hope the country doesn't do anything silly, like elect a lunatic president who goes around shooting anyone who looks like they might like smoking weed, or they might be fucked.

A currency doesn't have a single set value. It's worth different amounts to different people. Countries like Korea that actually use BitCoin have higher demand.
Most established currencies have so many people taking advantage of arbitrage that any difference irons out, but bitcoin is still small enough and volatile enough that discrepancies can be found easily.

It's not. 
Mortgage=a loan where the property purchased with the loan used as collateral.
There's no specific reason why that particular service *has* to be provided within the current banking system. It used to be provided by building societies, before they got taken over as banks. They are sometimes provided by credit unions as well... So, no..  you don't actually *need* a bank to obtain a mortgage. They are just the most common method under current conditions.

Name 1 modern country that still uses the gold standard.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:57:39
Yes. There is.
It's called arbitrage. But every transaction closes the gap eventually. As purchases at the lower rate will increase the price and sales flood the market at the higher priced market... Resulting in a reduction there (so, it's not infinite)
The money must cycle between currencies in fiat at some point, which carries large fees and long turnarounds. If the gap closes, or reverses within the 2 weeks it takes for the whole process... Bye bye profit.
If enough people arbitrage the money... The gap will inevitably close.
Now..  not everyone is able to open a bank account in two countries. So it limits the possibilities... But it can be done. And it is done... And people make huge profits along the way.

I used to work in banking, so my understanding of my enemy is somewhat more enlightened than most, but I wouldn't say the modern banking system is behaving in any way that places "The System" under any tangible threat. Individual firms within the system, certainly... But I don't see it. I don't even see Bitcoin as a tangible threat, because it provides a service that crypto never can, whilst crypto provides a service traditional banking never could. They occupy different spheres of the economy.
How are they killing themselves? In your eyes.
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:07:45
That's because you are protected from that violence by the government.
Anarcho capitalism isn't a hypothetical future economic system. It's what we had before. Eventually, the corporations that *did* force people to do shit with*actual* violence, declared themselves rulers and became legitimised as government.
@_date: 2018-05-01 19:07:45
Yeah, cos nobody thought of overthrowing the banking system in every decade since the 12th Century at all.
@_date: 2018-05-02 13:30:48
Absolutely. They don't really threaten the banking industry in any meaningful way 
High fees, if anything, are *good* for the banking system. It helps banks make more money. And fractional reserve banking is amazing for them. A government prints money... Diluting the value of the currency, but essentially hands 100% of that "extra" wealth back to the bank's so they can invest, and profit. The bank's don't suffer the effects of the inevitable inflation, because they recover their associated losses by increasing interest rates accordingly. The demand for finance is so high that people will, if necessary pay APRs in excess of a 1000%. So the system..  actually thrives on what you describe.
It is the people who suffer. Not the banks.

Just throwing this out there, but remember when Ross Ulbricht was indicted, and he lost access to his Bitcoin? The price spikes because such a vast amount of Bitcoin suddenly gets removed from the market.
  
Silk Road 3.0 is active. So he's clearly not a one-man operation. So ..  somewhere ... There are vast amounts of Bitcoin just sitting around on a data stick. It's not beyond possibility that an underworld actor has cashed in a shed load because... Reasons.

I've noticed a phenomenon whereby law enforcers, requiring as they do, a strong sense of camaraderie to do their duty, means that when some of them take advantage of their status... as so many people do when they have their hands on a small amount of power (HR... I'm looking at you, you fruit stealing bastards), are so much less likely to turn in on themselves.
Its been said that the biggest gang in New York is the NYPD. So when you have organisations like the [CIA]( monopolising the global drug trade... and a currency that can be traded without trace... I'm not surprised a few sticky fingered feds got greedy.
  
Its still fair for Ulbricht to be in jail though. We can act like he's some sort of Robin Hood hero, for allowing us to access a world of drugs, guns and stolen credit cards, if we like, but he was also a murderer too cowardly to get his own hands dirty (and that's what he's in jail for). While Shaun Bridges and Carl Force are also in jail for different crimes.

It's economics. Of course it's a science.
If you replicate the exact same variables in any scenario, you will get identical results. Every time.
The problem with that, is controlling the variables is nigh on impossible. But just because we can't observe this science easily, doesn't make it any less a science. Otherwise, you might as well argue that Max Planck wasn't a scientist.
It is foolish to assume that history will repeat exactly, not because it is an art, but because the variables have changed. There has never been a BitCoin price crash quite like the next one. Because that will be the first crash to take place after the investing community has learned from this one.
It's even more foolish to assume that history will *not* repeat itself. That is beyond stupid. There is a chance that predictions may be inaccurate.. yes, but there is a much greater chance that they will not be.

Not if my house happens to exist on a land, whereby a condition of that house existing there is to agree to a certain set of rules... Called "laws". And one of those so-called "laws" governs such concepts like "To what degree can a human claim exclusive ownership to an element that was in the ground for a billion years"... Or "Can the socially agreed government of the day also claim some right to the element that has been in the ground for a billion years, in accordance with laws" (and of course in my increasingly complicated analogy ... "I" am the aforementioned government of the day)
  
Edit: Why do people think concepts like morality and ownership can be boiled down to child-friendly snippets of analogy and still maintain any relevance

I suppose in a world without real community, a person's nation can be co-opted as an extension of oneself. 
Similarly that country's currency is an extension of the nation... And therefore a belief in the infallibility of one's currency translates as a belief in oneself.
You only need to look at the popularity of cocaine to realise how addictive false confidence can be.  
And only look at the prevalence of anorexia or obesity being translated as being a "real woman" to understand that self delusion is far from unusual.

It can be. Obviously, for it to be sound policy, there's a lot more to it than *just* straight up money printing.
Weimar Germany used it to pay off a debt, and did it excessively so it sent the nation into a downward spiral.
But, if used sparingly, and the extra currency is used to *build* something tangible, then it can be a totally sound way to develop an infrastructure.
It's always going to bump up inflation somewhat, but that doesn't *always* mean bad things. Lets say the nation prints out a shit ton of cash... but uses that to invest in, say, agricultural production... then it ensures that while *some* prices rise, others can fall... and potentially rebalance an unbalanced economy.

Nothing. Governments don't want to rock any boat too violently though. 
They don't just turn around and say "Bitcoin is banned", they have to slowly chip away and discredit it over time first. Emphasise​ the association with black markets and build a case for preventing money laundering and making Bitcoin too awkward to be viable. Either that, or risk losing power.

All the more reason to transit to Bitcoin.
If people resorted to Bitcoin for personal transactions (replacing the favour economy), then instead of people using fiat and occasionally Bitcoin for certain things (they need a trader to act as an intermediary), then it would be the other way around.

It's funny how you use Facebook clones as an example of how newcomers like MySpace can't take over. Given that MySpace ruled the roost for 3 years before Facebook took over, you're kind of disproving your own point.
