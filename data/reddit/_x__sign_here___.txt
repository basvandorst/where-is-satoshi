in relation to programed deflation, if an asset is very liquid and i know its going to be worth more next week than it is today, i might pick up/hold/hoard a few shares to benefit from that appreciation.

rgr DCF .expectations of an asset can be based off false assumptions (ie late 2000 housing market). just because bitcoin is trading at $500 doesn't necessarily mean it should be trading at $500.
may main concern is this this:
there are a finite number of bitcoins chasing unlimited wants-----&gt; value of Bitcoin increases over time----&gt;people begin holding (hoarding) bitcoins as an investment - human behavior, buy high sell low.

deflation is worse because a business or person has to account for fixed costs. your income may go down as well as variable costs but fixed costs are 'fixed' squeezing profit margins or savings you may have.

you could say everything has a fiat value as opposed to an inherent value. We run into the problem of equivocation where we ascribe titles to  the relationships we have with goods based on our CURRENT or IDEAL circumstances. You may say that you and everyone you know would say the value of 100 million dollars in gold bullion is worth exactly that yet, you all may change your mind if you found yourself on a deserted island with just 100 million dollars in gold bullion.

bitcoin is deflationary because there will ultimately be a finite amount  of bitcoins while consumers wants and needs will undoubtedly increase causing there to be fewer and fewer bitcoins relative to consumers wants and needs

yes,  everyone else trying to beat me to the punch of buying the asset now simply because they know the price will be higher is an example of people acquiring the asset, not to use the asset for it's intended purpose,  but to hold on to it till it appreciates. I think we are arguing from two schools of thought. your argument is any new information about an asset is analyzed and markets instantaneously adjust to the  new price. I disagree with this for two reasons. one, not all actors in the marketplace have access to the same information, two, some information maybe more qualitative rather than quantitative thus people could reach different conclusions about a price even though they are looking at the same information. apologies if I am incorrect in my assumption.   
In addition,  the average  non-shrewed investor would look at the rise in price  and assume, "if it's at blah blah blah now imagine where it will be a year from now and will undoubtedly purchase the asset as to not miss out on future gains. 
people who trade fx are looking to profit from currencies gaining in value against other currencies. not simply the interest that can be gained from them (ex. government bond)

srry but that argument: you have to create more money through debt to pay off previous debts, annoys the hell outta me!!! thats thinking about economics in a linear sense when it is more circular.  ex. lets say there are only two people in a economy Paul and Bob. Bob borrows $5 from Paul to build a widget producing machine the parts of which he bought from paul. lets say every year Bob produces 4 widgets 2 for him and he sells 2 to paul for $1 each. Lets say that Bob has to pay his loan back with interest so $6. lets say he pays a $1 a year to paul. What happens to that dollar? Paul uses it to buy more widgets next year.  with this process repeated six times (years) the loan with be paid off and no new debt created.

I'm not saying a currency must be inflationary. inflation is bad, it's just deflation is worse and  a currency that maintains a stable price level(i.e. a candy bar costs a dollar now and forever) is near impossible in a free market so the only thing you are left with to prevent the economy from collapsing on its self is targeted mild (1%-3%)  inflation. My true concern is when all is 'mined' and done, there will be a finite amount of bitcoins theoretical chasing an unlimited amount of wants. Currency need be a function of the economy; the amount of money in economy (money supply) should be allowed to flow up or down to facilitate transactions within the economy. As to your computer analogy,  your right, people don't wait forever to purchase a computer infinitely weighting the opportunity costs,  but people do wait to a certain extent I.e. a person may postpone the purchase of an item until it goes on sale.

so there is no reason for someone to hold/hoard/save their bitcoins?
"limited supply of a currency" is at the heart of my argument, what if it is the case, that at some point in the future,  there simply aren't enough bitcoins to facilitate transactions. it is this event I feel could cause a deflationary spiral; imagine 1920's America and there is literally only $1 in the entire country.
