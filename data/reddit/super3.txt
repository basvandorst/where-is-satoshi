Can those be removed from the results? Sounds like a terrible user experience. 
@_date: 2016-04-17 18:59:21
After we get over this crunch I would be happy to spend time and company resources to get OB on the web natively using our DHT in browser and object storage that could host the stores and not have them go down and work in browser. This is only if the OB team is open to work with us.
I'm of the opinion that OB must work in browser natively to gain traction with users other than just in the Bitcoin community. I want OB to succeed but the usability factor must be there. 
@_date: 2016-04-17 18:21:29
As one of them yes it can be done. Keeping your keys though is a little hard. All the other operations can be done though.

We are the biggest use case on Counterparty last time I checked 
@_date: 2016-04-10 13:48:13
One goal is to eliminate the need for most datacenters. Unused capacity is 10-100x all the datacenters in the world combined. Woah where did I say the way to success is through corporate deals? The platform is aimed at developers to build the cool applications for consumers.

@_date: 2016-04-17 18:17:47
If I have to use a gateway to use OB why just stick with a centralized service? OB should run native in browser. 
@_date: 2016-04-17 19:21:13
That gives me an idea. If OB requires a native app why not make it the method of purchase for apps and games and such. Apple and Google take a ~30% cut. 
@_date: 2016-04-21 13:36:41
You have to download special software to use it. Most people will not do it. That's why they use stuff like Netflix. One of the key advantages of Storj is that it works in the browser.

Well the user has subsidized costs. They already pay for Internet, electricity, cooling, and the hardware. A data center has to pay for that. 
Industrial Bitcoin miners didn't really exist in Bitcoin till around 2013, so 4 years in. I'm sure someone will spin up some data centers when Storj matures.
All good just clarifying 
@_date: 2016-04-17 18:00:31
Doesnt this defeat the purpose of OB?

Farmers with skin in the game preform much better than ones that don't. Farmers with no bond in Test Group A had a avg 18% uptime, Farmers in Test Group B had an avg 84% uptime. Night and day.
Also keeps the testing fair. Someone with extra capacity on a data center cant just throw 3PB at the network and take all the rewards. Would cost them quite a lot.

@_date: 2016-04-17 18:25:21
Interesting counterpoint. My thought is that it has to do with reward. I can get stuff and order of magnitude faster and free off P2P. Worth it enough to work the controls. In this case I have to work harder for something I can get off Amazon for about the same price and quicker.

W3C wants to put DRM in your browser. They are not your friends.
What I am advocating is that there is OB has a browser compatibility DHT so that people can use it without downloading software. Remove the barrier for 99% of users. 
@_date: 2016-04-17 18:11:07
Agreed. I'd even hazard to say that OB will be replaced by exact same thing that just runs in browser.

This is one of the reason I created Storj. Put control of content back in the hand of users. 
@_date: 2015-12-17 20:31:38
Yes, but there are some limitations on what you can do. 
@_date: 2015-12-17 21:29:55
@_date: 2015-12-19 15:39:26
Well someone has to pay doest have to be the watcher. The content creator could pay. Someone could create a relay website that displays ads to cover the cost of content. If the content creator had enough followers perhaps some of those followers would serve the content for free. 
Many options.

Convergent encryption is great, but has some issues around privacy and security. Kind of up in the air if we want to use that or not.

10 chunks of the file, and distributing them 3x. So 30 nodes total. 21 would have to go down at once inside of a minute for failure.

Storj lead dev here. So onename is more of a key-value data storage, where we handle more general files and data. 
@_date: 2015-12-18 13:33:14
We want a platform that is actively maintained. Not determined.  
@_date: 2015-12-17 20:24:52
@_date: 2015-06-30 22:59:22
This is accurate. I've always wanted to do something like that next. I think you have to solve the data portion first before something like Enigma can scale. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 17:03:26
For many use cases you don't need fancy consensus. Just do the notary, and have the user walk away with the cryptographic proof/receipt.
@_date: 2015-06-09 21:38:13
MultiBit is good software, but it really could use a UI overhaul. 
@_date: 2015-06-02 02:36:24
I disagree. This would break novel applications like BitPay's ChainDB. There are some examples were a fee larger then the amount sent is intended. 
@_date: 2015-12-29 20:09:25
Founder of Storj here. Love to chat with out about this service. Could be very useful for an in browser endpoint for a decentralized storage network. 
@_date: 2015-12-18 11:17:34
Storj is hiring 
@_date: 2015-06-10 17:02:20
tldr; Its kind of like Factom or ChainDB. You can notarize as many documents or data as you would like. No fancy network or consensus. You get a receipt which is all the information you need to do a proof. So after you get the receipt the original node that processes your notary could be smashed and everything would be fine.
Peter Todd gave me this idea at the infamous Satoshi Roundtable. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 12:25:15
Both could use a bit of a facelift. Better design would only encourage more use, and perhaps get newer users to use Multibit. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 23:21:51
Yeah it could "stores a hash on the blockchain periodically" for cheap. The rest would have to be done by the application you are describing. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 20:10:56
I stopped using MultiBit a while ago. Other wallets had a better interface. I'd defer to a designer on that.
@_date: 2015-12-03 15:30:35
How was working with the 21 API? Easy/hard? Well documented/poorly documented? 
@_date: 2014-04-11 09:04:14
Yes, AND for providing bandwidth. We plan to work with MaidSafe from day 1. We have been partners and passing ideas back and forth way before this project went public. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 01:41:09
For our system(Storj) no data I'd stored directly in the blockchain. You use the blockchain to keep track of everything. You can't sort large amounts of data in a blockchain because of bloat.
@_date: 2014-04-11 09:20:09
We are just figuring out that we can do more than just Proof of Work. Everyone played around with proof of burn, proof of stake, etc. Now people realize that we can proof of resource or other algorithms to **prove you did useful work other than just secure a blockchain**. This is a huge innovation and coins like Primecoin(which just broke another world record a day or two ago), shows you just a taste of how powerful this will be when it comes to storage or computation.  
@_date: 2014-07-18 15:40:29
CoinPrisim contacted us way too late and we were not able to really do an indepth comparison.

Yeah we would love to integrate tahoe-lafs as one of our data sources. They have made some awesome progress in the area of decentralized storage.

Also Bitcoin is not deflationary. 
@_date: 2014-08-17 21:43:38
So essentially unique encryption ensures that the farmer cannot know what chunk of the file he is receiving. Even if you have multiple colluding nodes random distribution using geographic identifiers leaves a very small chance that two redundant chunks will land of the same node group. 
@_date: 2014-08-26 15:34:30
Comments below offer a pretty accurate description of why not. If you are really concerned then use it over Tor or I2P and use full disk encryption.
@_date: 2014-06-24 20:45:48
I know that feel. Which is why I spent several thousand dollars of my own money getting our first app  built before even going public. 
@_date: 2014-05-30 15:17:49
Well you can run the software locally, and just use it to encrypt your files and store them yourself. If there is enough interest we can see if we can integrate on-the-fly encryption as an addon.
For me I think the long term solution to drive encryption is TPM chips.
@_date: 2014-05-13 05:59:20
This could easily be run off Storj but I have no idea how the incentives would work. Who would buy BitcoinNodeBandwidthCoin?
@_date: 2014-07-18 14:51:06
Yeah we love the Maidsafe guys and what they are doing. We have been talking from the very start. Maidsafe will be integrated into our front end apps as soon as their network is ready. We are also collaborating with other decentralized data protocols. 
@_date: 2014-06-24 11:32:35
The network is built to account for this. As long as you set a decent redundancy number you will be fine.

@_date: 2014-04-11 18:16:33
This is why we are tackling storage first. We should learn tons of things that will be helpful for computation. Homomorphic encryption with be the key to this.

If the Bitcoin devs, the 2-3 major pools, and the community(Bitcointalk and Reddit) agree then you are pretty much good to go.
@_date: 2014-05-15 18:19:58
Hybrid algorithms. Mining should be for the creation of coins but not securing the network. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 15:29:15
I can confirm that is its a faucet.
@_date: 2014-04-11 09:42:17
Thats the kicker. We plan to use Ethereum when they launch. We can use their smart contracts to build smarter Storj nodes.
@_date: 2014-05-15 17:13:52
Bitcoin Dev here. Yes. As long as its in everyone's interest then a hard fork is possible. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 09:21:45
I think so.
@_date: 2014-02-18 06:24:26
We actually might need to make this happen. 
@_date: 2014-06-24 12:54:14
I mean just replace the word Storj with the word internet and you get about the same result. I answered that here though: 
@_date: 2014-05-17 01:49:27
Last time I checked we had a $12,800 bounty for a MyCelium Peercoin fork. We can hire our own developers to build it, but we would need some technical guidance on how best to go about it.

Just waiting for sidechains to happen... Only two more weeks(tm).
@_date: 2014-04-12 01:44:23
@_date: 2014-07-19 17:01:01
If you have some time I'd like to pick your brains on my solution. 
As far as the "Google attack" its not possible for that to happen when the network gains strength. For example, rough numbers Google is storing 8k PB. Our calculations for user space is about 250K PB. So just as the "Google attack" won't work with Bitcoin, because there is no central computing source that is big enough to attack the network, the same will happen on Storj, but of course the network has to of course grow to that point, so we are in a similar situation to where Bitcoin was early on. 
I quite like that attack and I'll add it to my paper.
So I'm taking a page out of gmaxwell's original thoughts on Storj. We would like to make [Metadisk]( robust enough to work by itself. In this way Metadisk could be a Bitcoin agent running on a server on which a human has no control over. Of course there are some methods via perhaps TPM chips, in which the node would have to verify its running a particular codebase that does that. 
Maidsafe is working on the instant confirmations, low-fees, no-mining stuff. We are simply using Counterparty for now. I'd much rather use treechains or sidechains for the payment system, when/if they become implemented. Even though Storj uses blockchain for the core network and mediation, we want the payment system to be completely separate.   
@_date: 2014-08-16 17:29:42
Well we are both working on decentralized storage just taking different technical approaches. We have been talking for the beginning. Essentially on the front end apps we develop you will be able to use one, the other, or both.  There is also Siacoin and Permacoin you should look into. We like them too.
@_date: 2014-03-25 14:17:28
Actually I'm working on a whole new coin that is built for structured metadata. Will reward the full nodes with proof of resource algorithms, not the miners. 
@_date: 2014-07-24 20:03:10
Storj founder here. So this is actually untrue. So I've done a little bit of work on Bitcoin Core. I love Bitcoin and all our funding is in Bitcoin. One of the reasons why we are not using Bitcoin initially is because the 40 byte limit per transaction doesn't work for our platform. Should sidechains or treechains become a thing we would love to integrate back in right away, but we aren't holding our breath for it. 
So Bitcoin will be be used in our platform eventually, but let's make it technically viable first. 
@_date: 2014-09-23 06:44:17
Its deals with proper incentives. Bitcoin is great for the payment layer, but how do I reward the proper people on the network. Bitcoin itself has no idea of resources on a network for platforms like Storj. If you want a good paper to read, read the TorCoin one:
There are also many technical limitations like 10 minute confirmations, network and transactions attack vectors(tx malleability, DDOS attacks). Bitcoin is good, but not the cure all. 
@_date: 2014-08-04 22:42:32
@_date: 2014-03-13 16:38:16
Thats just the tip of the iceburg. 
@_date: 2014-07-19 16:32:01
Our model is ship, fix, ship, fix, etc. We are on the 3rd version of our decentralized storage app Metadisk, so its not really fair to say the project is not technically viable when you can use part of it now.
@_date: 2014-04-28 19:07:08
The mining portion of Bitcoin is centralized. About 4 major pools make up most of the hash rate. Don't believe me? look at the hard fork. All the pool owners called each other up and implemented the correct chain. 
The question is can think actually do anything malicious when everyone is watching. 
@_date: 2014-06-24 12:20:23
A hoster doesn't have to pay employee salaries, electricity, cooling, investor profits, building space, high end servers, maintenance, health benefits. 
All of those are sunk costs for a hoster. A hoster just has to click a button on the computer they already own and paid for.
@_date: 2014-07-19 16:28:41
Heartbeats don't need to be grouped. You do a heatbeat on an encrypted chunk of storage, which can be any size and contain multiple files.
@_date: 2014-06-16 21:31:21
So Storj already has a file storage and sharing web app running called [Metadisk]( Its currently in private beta for our forum users. It keep track of files purely through the blockchain.
Data storage is a pretty easy, I actually just implemented my Proof-Of-Storage algorithm in a few hours today. Its really just hashing. 
Decentralized computation is way harder (which is the meat of Amazon or Google Cloud). You have to use zero knowledge proof or some sort of quorum. 
So half of the decentralized cloud exists, and the other half you should start seeing next year.
@_date: 2014-04-07 06:48:28
Perhaps a Primecoin or NXT comic?
@_date: 2014-11-09 06:51:40
Storj lead dev here. So essentially you solve Sybil attacks with a mixture of pseudo-reputation systems, coin holdings, and enforceable bonds/smart contracts.
So essentially that solution involves decent peer discovery. Although I didn't go into the technical details the above is a solution that doesn't allow you to create a bunch of fake identities. Because nodes are incentivized to get data to you, then there should be many services and ways to facilitate peer discovery.   
At look at BitTorrent or and P2P software should show you that peer discovery is fairly trivial(although not entirely decentralized yet. BitTorrent uses trackers). 
@_date: 2014-04-13 01:39:11
We have a dual purpose use for the blockchain. We can use it for typical coin payments and use it to keep track of the files. Its like a 2 for 1 deal. 
@_date: 2014-12-07 15:41:09
Thanks will see what's wrong. 
@_date: 2014-04-12 01:50:18
If you read the Storj topic today it might be worth noting that Storj and Toroken are friends. We both won  and  place in the Texas Bitcoin Conference Hackathon. Love these guys and can't want to integrate them into the Storj platform so we can achieve full end to end encryption with a new fast Tor.

I think he was just referring to Dropbox, not Spotify. 
You should join us the the forum( We have covered the copyright portion a few times. Will make a blog post about it at some point. 
Disagree with the Google part. Spiders do a majority of the work, but the can only suck in so much information. You can outsource that to a decentralized network, you get much better coverage without the bottleneck. Furthermore users can now write algorithms to process that information into more than just a list of links. Just think of what you could do with entire RAW dataset of Google.

Vitalik emailed me a crypto spec to do that. I say tit for tat. Worse case you lose 10 bits, and never use that node again, and leave a bad rating. I don't think you need to add so much complexity and code when the total loss won't even be worth more than a penny. 
@_date: 2014-09-10 22:28:10
See Section 11.1 on the whitepaper draft:
tl;dr Your sybil attack vector assumes that you know which copies are redundant.
You are missing the economics of sunk costs and the actually data numbers. Data providers upcharge the core costs 10x-100x. 
A system like Storj can be run on top of centralized providers. It means that I have full control over my data, and can audit it at any time. Stuff like the iCloud incident doesn't happen because only the users have the keys to their files.   
@_date: 2014-04-11 09:52:58
So have I!
@_date: 2014-06-24 12:50:24
That supports like 40 bytes(or 80 bytes?), we need 1kb+. Plus the transaction fee is too large if you just wanted to store a single small file. 
We have to wait until sidechains or treechains until that becomes technically viable. :-(

Bitshares and Mastercoin will have live exchanges before Ethereum is even released. I don't doubt that Ethereum will dominate the blockchain compute space though.

22 a month wereas I can go buy a 2 TB drive for $60. So I break even in a month? 
Bandwidth depends on the application. 
It is. Create two microchannels. A to B and B to C. B implements a REST API. Then A and C can communicate through signed messages. Jeff Garzik posted a spec along the dual microchannels a couple of days ago on reddit. Search and read for that. 
Should have asked in the hangout so I could go indepth. 
@_date: 2014-12-12 23:34:59
First Storj branding and UI/UX design. Bitcoin core and other wallets are not user friendly to grandma. Microtransactions, I'd rather a Python lib than the current one in Bitcoinj. Integration with our shard auditing system and GVNs. 
I could go on.

When did you start using Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-12-16 16:36:08
Did you get it off the market or crowdsale?
@_date: 2014-06-24 12:03:20
You ask it. 
10-100x cheaper, faster, encrypted, private, and open source. 
@_date: 2014-09-23 07:11:17
I think your missing that this is a market now, and that is how markets work. You will have 1000 fail before a few get it right and dominate.

I've actually been spending some time with Vitalik from Ethereum which is why that post popped up. Been taking through all the problems and solutions for decentralized storage. 
@_date: 2014-10-15 01:36:48
Yeah pseudo reputation systems are pretty good, and we will use them in Storj. I think the best way to handle this case is to place a bet on a particular page. If someone disproves the information you or colluding nodes the disprover gets the reward. 
If someone wants to build something like this Storj would be happy to help in any way, as we can do a bunch off the data storage portion on our backend. 
@_date: 2014-09-23 07:42:33
But if the ISPs still control those lines, then is it really a "true" meshnet, or just an another protocol layer.

Was responding to you not OP. OP is correct. Storj is a lower barrier to entry because its not overly technical. Rent my hard drive to someone else. Average Bob understand that. So this will be most users introduction to crypto. Bitcoin and other cryptos will come layer. 
@_date: 2014-08-26 10:10:46
I'd reserve judgment until we release an actual paper. I wrote that back when decentralized apps were not even a term, and the protocol we use for our coin didn't even exist. I don't think you have read the  yet. 
Storj whitepaper is currently under private peer review. Once we get through that we will open it up for public peer review.

I agree. At this point Bitcoin is like the early internet, and we are still on dial up. Hardware wallets and multi-sig(coming soon!) should make this much easier.

Storj is also looking at heterogeneous networks. Cool projects out there like Siacoin, Permacoin, Tahoe-lafs, and Maidsafe. So if the Storj team gets droned a year for now the data should be able to migrate. 
@_date: 2014-08-19 20:38:14
Original Storj was autonomous agents. 
@_date: 2014-08-06 06:08:01
Use DHTs :-P
More seriously [Storj]( could handle the actually storage. From there you would want to look at [IPFS]( for hash addressable file system. From there its just building an indexing system with quick lookup times (which is not the easiest thing to do on a distributed system).

Put it on display(running) at the new BitPay offices, then you can transfer it to a museum at some point.

Mostly the solution involves smart contracts.  If Alice agrees to host Bob's data for 6 months and breaks the contract after 3. We might have 1 month in cost in escrow that gets automatically returned to Bob. Therefore we disincentives churn, and make it prohibitively expensive. We can add a lot more variables to it that the Bob and Alice can decided to agree on. 
Let me know if that addresses it or I need to expand further. 
@_date: 2014-06-24 11:46:56
Amazon has to cover costs for employees, data centers, servers, cooling, electricity etc. For a hoster well you already pay for all of that by having a computer. Add that to you selling your space on an open market. 
Ends up 10x-100x cheaper.
@_date: 2014-11-24 16:36:52
It took Bitcoin 3 years to get any kind of mainstream recognition that it even existed. Its still very difficult to use for the average consumer. 
These platforms are still very new, and I wouldn't rule then out until they had a reasonable amount of time to build and polish.

We aren't competing. We quite like the Maidsafe guys. Will make our first app, Metadisk, Maidsafe compatible in the future. 
You also neglecting the other good and viable options out there like Siacoin and Permacoin.

By encrypting the hell out of every file before it touches the network, and splitting most file into chunks. Each chunk is uniquely encrypted as well. 
The idea is that not even you will be able to recover any files stored on your  drive. You don't have the keys or the full data or even know what you are looking for.
@_date: 2014-07-19 15:43:07
Lead developer and founder here. I apologize for not being as responsive as I normally am. I'm currently at the Chicago Bitcoin Conference with the team.
So the original "whitepaper" was written way early in the development. At the point when it was written people were just getting into the idea of decentralized applications. Now that some of our algorithms are written, I just started rewriting the whitepaper from scratch.
We already have a beta application out called Metadisk that is available on our forums. I'm also working hard on our DriveMiner application, which is going to provide valuable *data* for the whitepaper.
I'd like to schedule a time to do an AMA or a Google+ Hangout where people can ask me questions directly. I've answered most of these questions already, but they are spread out over hundreds of comments and forum posts. So I need to spend my time on that whitepaper rewrite, which should put a ton of the questions to rest. 
I propose 8/2 be the date, which will give me time to recover from the conferences, and write a solid draft of a paper.  
**Update on 8/2: Will be available on  on freenode today.**

If you abstract away all the Sybil protection stuff, this is essentially how [Storj]( works on the payment layer. With micropayments, you don't have to do complicated proofs of bandwidth which is quite nice. [TorCoin]( gives us a little insight on how that could work as well.
As much as I like meshnets, they won't replace ISPs for a long time if ever. You can stuff a whole lot more data through fiber/hard lines/backbone than you can through the air. While the ISPs have their own problems, they certainly are efficient at getting data around. 
So I see the meshnet as an addition to the regular internet. It reaches areas where traditional networks cannot. 
@_date: 2014-08-16 17:52:09
Yes.

@_date: 2014-07-19 15:47:30
See my other post. I'm proposing that we do an AMA on 8/2 to address these all at once. Nothing is going to get done if we are trying to answer questions all over Reddit, when I can revise the whitepaper to answer most of them. 
@_date: 2014-08-16 12:30:56
Well Vatalik released an article today that crunched some numbers. My open ended question is how many nodes you need to get running to avoid collisions. Chunk collisions are ok, just chunk collisions containing the same data is bad.
Statistical functions are great but useless without real data. So I'm more concerned with getting the initial version of DriveShare out and getting data to work with. 
If you don't think we are moving fast enough you are welcome to join in and help. Just DM if interested. 
@_date: 2014-08-27 12:43:34
I wrote 30 pages to address all those questions in detail with calculations and pictures. How is that not better than a reddit comment?

How far along is your idea. I've got mine running right now.
@_date: 2014-08-16 16:03:16
I think people just don't seem to understand that the 9800 BTC is a very long term raise. We have a completely different model for crowdsale that most. Put I think people get sticker shock and don't read our terms or writing on why we choose that number. 
As far as that topic. There are many misconceptions about Storj. The original topic creator retracted as we got on IRC and answered a ton of questions. Storj technically is very complicated if you don't have computer science background, so I ask people to actually ask us questions before making knee jerk reactions. 
@_date: 2014-08-16 17:11:10
So this is existing in the Metadisk API. You can use it directly with Java or write a wrapper to make it easier.

What happens when you turn off your computer when mining? You stop mining and stop earning rewards as well.
People can turn off their computers no big deal. The network is able handle it.
We don't have any magic numbers. When the network is up and running we will determine from the data how much redundancy is needed.

I think Ether has some good ideas on compute. They will have enough resources to pull something off. 
Bitshares will most likely achieve network effect on the distributed exchanges. An entire ecosystem will follow. 
Mastercoin needs to change direction. Everything rests on their exchange platform ATM. 
@_date: 2014-09-18 02:42:29
I have a theory that this kind of fork can't work. The first "appcoin" will always have network effect, and developer support. This is coupled with the fact that no developer in the crypto space have free time on their hands, so no one would even take the time to do it.
@_date: 2014-04-11 09:29:02

Here was my reply to BitCloud:
So I've been quite interested in this space for quite a while, and been talking to David about it as well. I'm pursuing a top down approach to this problem, and have implemented a rudimentary web based uploader that tracks its bandwidth and storage space. If you guys are working on the lower level protocol I could give a hand, and perhaps we can meet in the middle with a finished product rather quickly.
Bitcloud is certainly further thought out that some of the other concepts I have seen. Here are my nipicks and ideas by category. I think you are on the right track, but I think it needs some work. 
 
**Proof of Bandwidth**
This is the core of your protocol. Would like to see see more on this. I have access to Sunny King (creator of Proof-of-stake), and would be happy to pass this by him when something solid is created. 
Also working on a more polished version of 100% proof of stake that hopefully will be ready soonish. That codebase might make things a bit easier for you.
**Encrypt Everything and Eliminate Moderators**
Simplify the process encrypting everything. This is the path that I am following for my protocol. Everything should be encrypted before it even touches the network. Just as routers don't care about the data packets they are sending, nodes should propagate bytes neutrally. This greatly reduces the complexity of your codebase. 
**Data on Demand**
Moderators and deciding what content should be stored on a node creates a human bottleneck. Imagine how long it would take to generate a block if someone had to manually check every transaction. It's simply not scalable. Have nodes bid on data "contracts" on an open market. 
**Blockchain Usage**
How are you dealing with blockchain bloating? Some sort of pruning? Seems like it would become very large, very quickly. 
@_date: 2014-08-06 06:56:39
Token is used to buy and sell GBs in the Storj software. What people do with it other than that is on them. 
It gets so gray after that. I buy a potato for a $1. I'm supposed to eat the potato, but instead I sell that potato for $2. Under New York regulations, I must get fingerprinted and have a background check, get the name and address of the person I bought and sold from, probably register as a MSB too. 
@_date: 2014-09-23 07:31:03
What would be your solution then?
@_date: 2014-03-28 19:10:42
Bitcoin dev here. There is, but its not very easy. If there is a design that the community likes I'm sure we can get it done.
@_date: 2014-05-17 14:42:49
Bitcoin dev here. I was considering building something like with with coingen.io as a backend, but I got caught up with Storj. This is something that I might build out for Storj internally, and then transfer Bitcoin development. 
1 month is too small for a project of this magnitude. I suggest you either do a hackathon or have the submission date for written proposals only.
@_date: 2014-08-16 10:30:42
Its not magic. Bittorrent and other P2P tech seem to do this just fine. 
@_date: 2014-08-16 10:36:41
Uniquely encrypted redundant copies. You use a blockchain for trustless verification using merkle roots of hash challenges.  
@_date: 2014-08-30 14:30:02
We have a small demo right here:
@_date: 2014-07-08 00:16:49
Why not have both? Bitorrent requires special software and you risk alienating most average users who don't know how torrents work or a good amount of users that have P2P throttled or blocked. We do encrypted over port 80/81. Looks like regular web traffic.
You can still do the exact same thing but completely from a web app if you wanted too. When it comes time to store the physical file store it both on BitTorrent and the Storj network. You have to wait for seeders to catch up on the BitTorrent network, while on the Storj network you have unlimited "seeders" because the file is automatically cached on a server you request it from. 
We already are working on key/ resource in a blockchain. So really Storj could take care of the data storage, still use BitTorrent as a primary or backup, and handle simple decentralized metadata with a API.
@_date: 2014-04-11 09:41:20
We have a different model. We hate two weeks(tm). We release feature by feature. Our web nodes are working. I can probably do a demo video or something after this dies down a bit.
@_date: 2014-04-10 23:18:18
You solve this by splitting the any file into small chunks, and encrypting everything on the network. Furthermore you can encrypt the entire actual disk location where you are storing the chunks. 
In this way are legally and technically protected. No one(not even the software) knows whats stored on the drive physically. 
@_date: 2014-11-24 16:41:26
Depends on what group you are in here:
If you are hardcore just build it from source:

They don't use a blockchain.
@_date: 2014-07-16 06:36:30
I'm working on a tool to do exactly that. 
@_date: 2014-06-24 12:34:55
We check the data periodically if a data source is missing or damaged then we recover it. In reality it might be 100 chunks of a file with 3 copies of each chunk on 100 machines. Machine or two might go offline, but the network will just copy the data to another machine next time it checks.
@_date: 2014-05-26 10:20:35
Storj seems missing from this. 
@_date: 2014-04-15 02:17:04
I'm not too worried. Bitcoin Core has excellent code review, and its hard to "pull a fast one" on a public ledger.
@_date: 2014-01-06 21:42:36
Well I've used them for years, and my coins haven't been affected. So dunno what to tell you.
@_date: 2014-09-06 05:54:18
And Bitcoin can't scale up to Visa/Mastercoin level, but no one complains because everyone understands that its an incremental process.

will? It already is?
@_date: 2014-07-18 20:32:07
We can precompute the challenges before we distribute the file. Then you store the merkle root in the blockchain so the server can't cheat.

@_date: 2014-08-08 07:50:26
Agreed, you can't have mining on decentralized storage. Sybil attacks as you described will end up killing you. 
The solution is account for redundancy on the network level, not physical level. And like you said rewards must be direct. 
We hope you won't think Storj is a scam after we release the 2nd whitepaper. :-P
@_date: 2014-11-26 16:35:10

So as hashing hardware becomes more and more powerful, could you guesstimate a time period where a large cluster of ASICs could produce a collision? 
@_date: 2014-11-25 01:48:10
Both. See its all about the application. 
If you are accessing and changing that data a bunch it might be a good idea to have most of the data in a central place. So for example big data applications or a video game. 
In other cases like data backup, centralized Storj service would be the worst idea. You would want that to be as distributed as possible. 
At the end of the day the application or user gets to choose where their data goes. 
@_date: 2014-08-19 18:37:10
We are planning an AMA at some point. 
@_date: 2014-08-16 10:44:12
This exactly. You use it for rewards and to keep people from cheating in the verification process which is essentially a hash challenge. 
@_date: 2014-03-25 13:46:00
I've heard many complaints about all the altcoins, then we can't allow an extra 40 bytes for the metachains that are trying to build on top of Bitcoin?
Blockchain bloat is a technical problem that can be solved. I don't think anyone should be gatekeepers to what should or should not be stored in the blockchain.
@_date: 2014-01-26 14:36:41
Ha ha. That's me on the right next to David from Mastercoin.

@_date: 2014-03-25 14:38:46
No, in general. Full nodes are important for a healthy network. They should be getting some of the block reward, not just the miners.
@_date: 2014-06-24 11:49:05
Trustless system. Using a hash challenge you prove that the 3rd party is indeed holding your file. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 01:42:44
If you know so much about Storj what blockchain are we currently using to prototype the system?
@_date: 2014-04-11 13:13:04

We just got demos for decentralized video, images, and audio this week. We have quite a few things running on Metadisk already, we just haven't started promoting them yet. 
One thing is to tell you its possible the other thing is to show you a demo of Metadisk actually doing it. Trying to get away from two weeks and more it already works.

By that logic Bitcoin could be considered silly in 2009. It was just curious if the miners would be open to reducing their reward to something else that is beneficial to the network (i.e. more full nodes). Do you have an alternate way to phrase the question to get 
Thanks for the clarification on the hard fork vs soft fork. 
Agreed my contributions have been to the out edges of Bitcoin Core. That is because I believe that documentation is more important. What good is open source if only a dozen or so people really understand it? The domain of knowledge needs to expand. I've complained about it a bit in person to the devs that I met at the conferences. I've also tried my best to contribute the readability of the repo as just one person. The recent developer documentation that was released was awesome and should be a huge step forward.
Interesting, no one has really called me out on that. I used to just say Bitcoin dev, but when they changed it to Bitcoin core, I just said Bitcoin Core dev. Not using the title to be obnoxious, but just to establish some prior knowledge of how the protocol works so I can get some tech talk back. Can you suggest something else that can achieve that same result? Will spend some time with the client code then. I'm almost happy with my "tree trimming" stuff.
@_date: 2014-10-12 02:14:32
This has been on my wish list for a long time. Great to see it finally going into the codebase. Many thanks to sipa, and the other bitcoin core devs for making this happen.

You are confusing our development demo with the production software. Metadisk is software and inherently customization. One Metadisk instance would be locked down, have no cleartext keys, etc. Anther one would be publically accessible, and be shareable. 
You would upload your cat pictures to one, and super secure files to the other. Also I think you are confusing Metadisk the application, with Storj the underlying platform. Files are encrypted and distributed on both.
@_date: 2014-03-25 16:38:54
Then you support coin validation right?
Well I am building one. 80 bytes is not that large.
@_date: 2014-01-21 02:33:18
As someone who is working on a project like this, specifically for storage space, the concept is quite exciting.
While the concepts are solid, the algorithms have been quite empty for a while. We are just moving on from concepts like Proof-of-work. Ultimately you need proof-of-compute, proof-of-storage, proof-of-bandwidth, to make this work in a trustless manner. Either that or things like microtransactions and contracts which are being worked on now.
@_date: 2014-06-24 14:09:42
Well he/she can't hide deleting the data. He/she won't be able to pass the hash challenge at the next file check in. He/she can't do metadata analysis on the network if all the metadata is encrypted. 
Unlike a 51% attack you can just increase redundancy, and use algorithms to make sure that the data is evenly distributed across the network. Don't like 3x? Use 10x.

Well we build front end services that can plug directly into MaidSafe's network. This provides them with a large userbase of average consumers for which they have to do no additional work. 
The better their network works the less time we have to spend on the algorithmic on the data storage, and instead focus on building awesome decentralized applications, adding automation, and focusing on next generation of the Storj platform which includes computation.

The question was 'Do they have enough people signed up yet?', so I'm simply stating that we have enough people signed up to bootstrap a solid network. 
The user/password model is dumb and old.  You want people using elliptical curve crypto instead, with hierarchical keys. The trick is making the UI easy, so they don't miss the old user/pass.

I've also made 5 figures in a few hours, but altcoin trading. Their markets are way more volatile and easier to make a quick buck. And since you are trading coin to coin it is all very liquid.

1) The Bitcoin developers are never going to implement the features that we need and want into the wallet software.
2) The economics of Storj are completely different from Bitcoin. 
3) We are/will be using Ethereum, Florincoin, Counterparty, and Factom, so we are not limited to token.
4) We need reward farmers, no miners. 
5) Using coins as a psuedo-reputation system as well. I have yet to write a paper on that. Hints of it in our current whitepaper. 
@_date: 2014-05-01 11:58:26
No, we are not. See the story above. We have been working with them for a while. Storj and MaidSafe are collaborators and we will integrate them directly. All of the benefits of both platforms rolled into one.

"trail of bread crumbs to your house." That is a gross oversimplification. Yes, just break through multiple rounds of file and communication encryption on computers spread throughout the globe on a network that was built to be trustless. 
I'm just a little tired of the save the children argument as a way to invite censorship into an open and free system.
@_date: 2014-04-13 16:44:28
I don't understand this putting data in a blockchain is bad mentality. The blockchain doesn't have feelings or morals(yet?). Its a data structure. It shouldn't matter what's being stored. The problem is that it doesn't scale at the moment. You store things in the blockchain it gets bloated. Makes full nodes kinda cumbersome, but if you are not running a full node you have no argument. It doesn't affect you. You solve the bloat problem technically with prunable outputs, micro transaction channels, sidechains, etc. Not "oh *my* blockchain is too holy for your plebeian data" People need to stop defending bugs and technical flaws with emotion. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 14:26:24
Yeah, we want to clean that up before we put it out. if you have specific questions just ask, but its going to take us some time to get everything formally written out.
We do this by abstracting the file storage from the front end. When you actually want to download the file back you pay a node for the bandwidth to retrieve it. They can't send you the wrong data because you can quickly just check the hash.
So we provide a reward for a node to store the data, and a reward for it to retrieve it.

Main different is that we use a blockchain and they don't. 
Funny story, we we working with David Johnson from BitAngels and doing research for Storj in the early days of the project, and we stumbled upon MaidSafe. We introduced them to Bitcoinland, and the rest is history. 
Basically we are collaborators, and we will be integrating MaidSafe directly into the Storj network.

People will always spread FUD no matter what you do. The general public still thinks Bitcoin is just used for drugs, but most are coming around.
People are pretty happy with their money now. It works. But it only takes a couple iCloud hacks before people will start to wake up to new options.

@_date: 2014-05-28 00:21:48
This concept is a little bit more than an idea. I've been working on it for the past year, or so and we are just about ready for the release of our crowdsale and some of our beta software Metadisk (which does decentralized autonomous file storage). 
I encourage you to read more at [Storj.io]( and/or ask any questions you might have.

4) convergently using hmac-sha256 for now
5) multiple rounds of encryption make sure only the network and user knows the contents of the file. 
@_date: 2014-03-25 14:08:02
The blockchain is a data structure. Why do people get to state what it may or many not be used for? 
@_date: 2014-04-11 00:16:06
Storj solves that by enforcing redundancy at the network level. Therefore if you turn off your computer you only loose 1 of the 3 copies. The network is self healing so it will store that file in another location at the next checkin time.
@_date: 2014-06-07 04:07:50

@_date: 2014-07-24 23:25:26

That whitepaper was written before we started doing implementation. The  team has been working mostly on our web software, so the whitepaper is not updated to all the things we learned. Its on the todo list in the next couple days.
There are multiple algorithms but I'm guessing your are referring to the encryption algorithms. Currently we are using convergent encryption with HMAC-SHA256 and AES128-CTR.
Oh the browser javascript is just for our web software. We wanted to make a web app first as a proof of concept, the move to the desktop. That way you don't have to install any crap when you are just testing it out. 
If you encrypt the file client side then no one can get access to your data. Therefore you can have a trustless exchange of data. 
@_date: 2014-04-07 01:35:55
Yeah, somewhat. jgarzik's post is something that this aims to be in a year or two. Just starting with decentralized storage for now.

@_date: 2014-01-16 23:06:48
Hello All, 
So I've been quite interested in this space for quite a while. I'm pursuing a top down approach to this problem, and have implemented a rudimentary web based uploader that tracks its bandwidth and storage space. If you guys are working on the lower level protocol I could give a hand, and perhaps we can meet in the middle with a finished product rather quickly.
Bitcloud is certainly further thought out that some of the other concepts I have seen. Here are my nipicks and ideas by category. I think you are on the right track, but I think it needs some work. 
 
**Proof of Bandwidth**
This is the core of your protocol. Would like to see see more on this. 
Also working on a more polished version of 100% proof of stake that hopefully will be ready soonish. That codebase might make things a bit easier for you.
**Encrypt Everything and Eliminate Moderators**
Simplify the process encrypting everything. This is the path that I am following for my protocol. Everything should be encrypted before it even touches the network. Just as routers don't care about the data packets they are sending, nodes should propagate bytes neutrally. This greatly reduces the complexity of your codebase. 
**Data on Demand**
Moderators and deciding what content should be stored on a node creates a human bottleneck. Imagine how long it would take to generate a block if someone had to manually check every transaction. It's simply not scalable. Have nodes bid on data "contracts" on an open market. 
**Blockchain Usage**
How are you dealing with blockchain bloating? Some sort of pruning? Seems like it would become very large, very quickly. I'm working on a concept called infoblocks. Basically you keep your metadata separate from the blockchain, which makes them easy to prune. 
@_date: 2014-07-12 02:11:19
@_date: 2014-07-19 15:22:09
This is a target we never expected to reach. It gives us leftover coins to distribute in early mining and future crowdsales for newer platforms.
@_date: 2014-08-17 21:59:00
Yup. Such collaboration. Wow.
Undefined. Now that the crowdsale is finished probably need to spend some time buried in the code before going to more conferences. 
@_date: 2014-06-24 12:45:52
99% percent right. Instead of another key we just add some extra data before we encrypt it. That way 3 copies might contain the same data, but we can verify that they are unique files themselves.
@_date: 2014-04-10 23:24:12
Oh you are talking about us then. It's called [Storj](
@_date: 2014-05-13 00:45:12
Hmmm. Actually now that I think about it about it this is something we could do on Storj as a module. Proof of resource algorithms could make this easy to implement on the main protocol. I wonder if the miners would be able to give up a few BTC of block reward. 
@_date: 2014-08-13 02:00:10
If you are sharing a cat picture, then most people would be comfortable with that.
For anything else you would want to use the end to end encrypted apps. This early demo should not be confused with what we intend to release for production.
@_date: 2014-04-13 01:46:36
We are using Bitcoin for payments, and using a blockchain to manage the file network. We won't use Bitcoin blockchain until sidechains are ready. No need to delay the project for months when we can just switch later. 
@_date: 2014-08-25 14:02:35
This. We already have a good solution, people just have to actually use it. 
@_date: 2014-12-07 06:32:16
But its a premine vaporware :-P
@_date: 2014-01-22 21:39:38

@_date: 2014-06-24 15:09:50
Soon. 
@_date: 2014-07-27 03:26:34
At stated many times before, we can't use Bitcoin until sidechains or treechains become a thing. We need more than the 40 bytes than are in the standard Bitcoin transaction. 
Our protocol is already open source. I wouldn't accept anything less.
td;dr We will when its technically viable, but until then we will bootstrap and provide value to Storjcoin X.

Without multiple chains or pruning storing data in a blockchain is a poor approach. Just not scalable to petabytes of data. Datacoin already does what you described.

We have about 7k people signed up, and we haven't really been around that long. I think many people will jump in when start pushing software. To put that in prospective Bitcoin has about [7k full nodes running right now](  
Yes. I believe the recent iCloud hack is just starting to show how bad centralized cloud storage can be when it fails. It will be a very easy sell when the network starts to go live.

@_date: 2014-04-11 00:40:44
Don't underestimate metadata. 
I'll address your core question though. You have hard drive space that you are not using. If I offered a few bucks for it most people would take me up on that. Google has to pay for data centers, hardware, servers, power, staff, shareholder profit, building space, cooling. You already pay for that stuff regardless of what your computer is doing(essentially that is all sunk costs).
Therefore you can get a few extra bucks a month, but provide storage at a cost that would be impossible for Google or any company to provide. 
Look at our whitepaper for more information.

Storj founder here. Can answer any questions you have. 
The blockchain is such an amazing technology. Storj just builds on that using the transaction ledger for so much more. Not only is it built with Bitcoin tech, when sidechains/treechains come out Storj will pretty much run off Bitcoin directly. 
Decentralize all the things!
@_date: 2014-07-14 19:04:33
To be clear we just released Metadisk yesterday on the forum. We are still working on the backend for DriveMiner. After the crowdsale madness dies down, we should have a command line version. We will be releasing it slowly and only to crowdsale participants. I like the Google model. First then 10 users, then 100, then 1000, etc. So make sure you hold on to the address you bought SJCX with because that's the only thing that will work with the early software.

Start with this paper:
@_date: 2014-07-19 16:04:48
Thanks for the support. Everyone was super excited about Storj 24 hours ago, with one working app, and another one on the way. I think we will put things to rest once I get the whitepaper draft out. 
@_date: 2014-08-16 12:12:25
Really depends on the contract that the node has. Could go either way based on that. Basically its up to the farmer and user to figure that out at the start of the hosting the file. 
@_date: 2014-08-16 15:50:50
A single non colluding node can disprove thousands of malicious  nodes. We have a dual use for the hash challenge algorithm. We both check integrity and availability.  
@_date: 2014-08-16 11:38:39
Thanks. Yeah I added erasure encodings to the specs and paper since we talked in Chicago. Looks like you did a bunch of the math for me. :-). I'll take a good read of this and see what needs to be updated and moved around in the paper. 
Mostly focused on getting DriveShare out so we can get real data on that. 
I think I want to add something to the attack section that you addressed. I'm thinking of calling it the "hostage bit" unless you can think of a better name. 
@_date: 2014-08-26 10:04:55
But Metadisk is.  is a link to a node running PR0. 
DriveShare is coming along, but at least having an application you can try to help dissuade the idea that we are vaporware. 
@_date: 2014-07-15 23:05:43
We are also excited about Maidsafe. It was actually when we researching the project, we came upon Maidsafe and the BitAngels introduced them into the world of Bitcoin, and here we are.
When Maidsafe is more feature complete we will be integrating them into our front end software.

We could in the future, but it doesn't make sense at this point. We can make modifications and changes to our own token, including metadata and verification like transactions. These cases would never be accepted into Bitcoin Core.

What is the size of the metadata that coinprism uses?
@_date: 2014-04-11 09:13:03
Chunkup has the right idea in mind. There are many ways to do this, but microtransactions + chunks seems to be the best way using existing tech.  This is something we can integrate now, and the upgrade to a "proof of resource" algorithm later. 
Our partner Maidsafe, is working on this. And we have our own internal ideas of how this should work, and are working on prototyping. Keep in mind that proof of resource its pushing the limits of PhD level computer science, so I don't want to point to a specific way of doing it until the theoretical models turn into actual code. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 06:29:50
Ah another enlightened one. This could be easily accomplished on the Storj network or using the node software. PM me and lets talk. Love to see this up and running in the next month or two. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 01:30:06
Well that is the standard test for a decentralized storage technology. No one is going to use it if there is a risk the FBI is going to bust down your door and charge you for something you didn't do. 
Its almost like if you were to get arrested for buying cocaine because you used Bitcoins that were used on the Silk Road at some point. No one would exactly be happy with tracking all the Bitcoins either. 
So we have the same problem with a storage network. We can censor and monitor all the data, or we can simply treat all data on the network as a locked box. We are only responsible for passing it along not for its contents. That way we can avoid the problems of the people that will always abuse any technology. 
@_date: 2014-04-23 15:19:56
Our code review is pretty good. This is highly unlikely. 
@_date: 2014-08-26 09:39:34
Well you just share the keys to the data. 
@_date: 2014-06-04 22:19:33
Permacoin seems to be a whitepaper at this point. The decentralized storage part of Storj is already running on Metadisk.
@_date: 2014-01-06 03:32:27
Ha ha. The parody is actually better than the original. 
@_date: 2014-05-16 19:05:12
You are forgetting that there are other competing altcoins out there. If they develop this first they could gain market dominance your Bitcoins will be worth nothing 
@_date: 2014-11-25 01:59:00
We have them they just aren't front and center.
Then the more general one for Storj here. Its a bit drafty:
I did a bunch of research in my undergrad, so I kind of see papers through that lens. Since very little people read and understand the papers I find it best to write code from which we can get data from. Test group A will give us invaluable data. From there we can write some small papers with real data to back up the assertions. 
@_date: 2014-05-01 01:46:08
Yup. Here is a screenshot just for you:
Pretty soon. We are just finishing up the 'Your Account' portion that you see there. After we do some good bug testing we will start letting our early supporters play around with.
Nodes will mostly be be rewarded in Bitcoin and Storjcoin, but theoretically it can be any coin if someone wants to code the module.
@_date: 2014-08-16 12:33:03
Well we use that for simplification purposes. A 100 MB file split into 10 MB encrypted chunks, with 3x redundancy is 30 chunks which can each live on 30 nodes.  
@_date: 2014-05-01 02:03:00
At least we won't piss of this time for buying all the gpus up.

@_date: 2014-03-09 16:58:55
I am. Just won the Texas Bitcoin Conference hackathon with a proof of concept decentralized storage engine to power Storj. After we stabilize our codebase a bit more, implementing a basic agent would take a weekend. So look for something soon. 
@_date: 2014-09-01 13:39:42
@_date: 2014-05-13 06:03:01
I like the idea of smooth ramping and block reward transfer. 
@_date: 2014-07-18 16:18:02
This is incorrect. There is no coin mining on Storj. This prevents centralization of huge hard drive  mining pool. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 09:39:26
Just add Bitcoin and Mix!

There was a bunch of buzz, walked outside and some dude was just shouting out bids. Maybe a crowd of like 70 people.

See DACs
@_date: 2014-03-25 13:51:56
I think it will be first be pushed toward metadata chains, and the once proof-of-resource is fleshed out a bit more it will go that way.
@_date: 2014-08-26 09:38:35
We are taking different technical approaches to the same problem. Don't forget about Siacoin and Permacoin. We are taking about the future internet here. I see then all succeeding in various ways. 
@_date: 2014-06-19 01:05:16
We use a release cycle similar to Google. Release to 10 users, fix, release to 100 users, fix, rinse, repeat. 
We plan to have a crowdsale on July 15th which should give a huge boost to development. I'm thinking we should have an solid prototype end of next month, and we will start learning what works and what doesn't. We will release it when its ready, not before. Data security is involved, so we got to go it right. Not trying to Gox anyone here.
Our decentralized file storage web app Metadisk might be useful for that. I'd recommend pre-encrypting it. Its currently free while we working on version 3. If you ping me on  I'll give you early access, and you can tell me if that would work. 
@_date: 2014-07-18 15:37:16

Boo hoo. Are you going to miss a few megabytes?
@_date: 2014-08-16 11:26:44
Hey that's me.  is a good place to start. Just post here I'd you have any questions. Try my best to get to all of them 
@_date: 2014-07-27 19:11:54
Solid questions. So the buying and selling of storage space occurs on a market. If we could accurately predict a market, I would be day trading Bitcoin right now :-P. 
This is really weird when the traditional cloud storage providers normally set fixed costs. But it had allowed providers like Dropbox to take Amazon S3, upcharge 100x, and call it Dropbox premium for years. An open market is more fair in my opinion. 
So unlike ASICs. Hard drives are on every internet connected computer. You can create as many large setups as you would like, but ultimately it comes down to sunk costs. It takes lots of money to build up huge farming operation. On the other hand I can just connect to a few people only a few miles from me. No one actually had to buy any more hardware, you already bought the computer. So essentially farming operations have to compete standard farmers with zero costs(sunks costs to be specific). 
Because large companies barely know what a blockchain is, much less how to use it. The system doesn't work without cryptocurrency to reward the user. 
"Even with physical access to the storage servers, SpiderOak staff cannot see even the names of your files and folders." There is no cache of physical servers with Storj. Is SpiderOak open source? You have to trust that the system doesn't have any backdoors, or bugs which could expose your data.
@_date: 2014-03-05 12:19:54
Just go for it. Took me a couple of tries before I got a pull request accepted. 
@_date: 2014-07-18 21:59:33
Counterparty and BTC for now, because it exists. If something else comes out, we can create an altcoin, give SJCX holders stake in it, and see how it turns on on the market.
@_date: 2014-04-11 10:02:32
We also build decentralized applications which both Maidsafe and Storj can share. We have been partners and passing ideas back and forth way before this project went public. We plan to work with MaidSafe from day 1.

@_date: 2014-07-06 21:50:09
Well we are a data protocol similar to Amazon S3. You can implement stuff like Dropbox or SpiderOak, essentially apps, on top of that. 
Storj would just provide the storage :-P, and Spotify would of course handle the application logic. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 12:32:17
This is absolutely false. Which poor person can afford a $7,000 KNC miner? Bitcoin inflates the money supply by about 10% a year. That is several hundred million usd in new Bitcoin being created and devaluating mostly everyone who can't afford a miner. You don't realize this simple because the Bitcoin price has risen so fast its overtaken that.
Under proof of stake for Peercoin that's is 1% and anyone can do with without a miner. Add the fact that transaction fees are destroyed so under high transactions its actually deflationary. 
The whole thing that the rich get richer is insane. When you get interest on your saving account do you complain that rich get richer? Sure I'd like a $1,000 interest on my $10,000, but that would be stupid and unsustainable for the economic system.
@_date: 2014-06-26 00:10:27
Bitpay already has core developers in its employ. I think the userbase needs to be less apathetic about development. The Peercoin website has received about 10 BTC of donations, while Bitcoin repo has received about 1 BTC.

I wouldn't be too sold on the reliability part. Amazon has gone down before and taken a 1/4 of the internet with it. 
Now when has the Bitcoin blockchain or a P2P network gone down? I do believe you are right. We have to prove that this has better cost/reliability, by having the network run well for a time.
@_date: 2014-01-22 00:24:52
Proofs might not be the best way to do it. Just an idea.
Proof-of-storage is done at the network level rather than the physical level. You actually get better quality redundancy. 
Less proof-of-bandwidth more like let me pay per chunk of data you send.
@_date: 2014-03-25 14:05:48
Well until we have better proof of resources, or use proof of stake.

Storj is in the business of building software, not issuing securities. Our crowdsale terms are a little more clear on that. Our crowdsale functions more of a Kickstarter for pre-release of a software, than a sale of tokens. 
@_date: 2014-04-01 15:20:34

The whitepaper should answer some of those questions: 
Let me know if there is any that were not covered there.
@_date: 2014-07-27 20:57:45
We can also throw in regular pen testing bounties programs too. Been doing Bitcoin since 2012, so I'm used to the speculation roller coaster. 
@_date: 2014-11-24 20:14:21
1) Centralization is fine in some instances. For example, I can have the data stored in a data center, but the Storj software would allow me to audit that data and make sure they never have access to the actual files. No huge cost savings, but privacy and security are increased a ton.
2) See Bittorrent. Also highly depends on the application. We could be talking about everything from data backup(very low) to video distribution(very high).
3) I would argue the opposite. With traditional architecture a switch failure, maintenance, or region outage can affect reliability. If you take a file and distribute 50 pieces to global regions its very unlikely that any specific event will affect reliability. If you have like a redundancy of 500 your going to need a few nukes to actually produce downtime. 
4) EMC charges $3k a TB. Amazon charges about $50-$300(depending on bandwidth) per month. Considering I can buy 2 TB for $60 thats a 10-100x margins in a year. Margins only a Bitcoin miner could wish for. Data is overpriced by a ton
We are pretty open. Feel free to take a look at that code, kick the tires, and let us know if we can learn or improve in any way.
@_date: 2014-07-18 22:03:17
You want to know the sad thing? Dropbox actually just uses Amazon S3. When you pay $99, they only pay $1(and thats at 100% utilization)...
So will Storj be cheaper? Without a doubt. 
@_date: 2014-12-03 23:04:30
I think this is progress:
@_date: 2014-07-18 14:32:33
We don't plan to raise that much. What we have left will be dispersed to the crowdsale participants via early mining, and future crowdsales as developers build more platforms on Storj.
@_date: 2014-04-12 17:01:40

Its a hybrid proof-of-work/proof-of-stake. Its been implemented since 2012. 
@_date: 2014-08-16 11:53:21
Exactly correct. We account for redundancy on the network layer not the physical layer. See my above comment. 
@_date: 2014-01-12 11:55:31
Shoulda gone scrypt. 
@_date: 2014-07-18 17:30:35
From SpiderOak:
"Even with physical access to the storage servers" Storj doesn't even have physical access to your files. 
Is SpiderOak open source? Where can a view and audit their code?
@_date: 2014-09-06 05:17:38
Storj here. We have a very specific plan for getting it to mass market. Abstraction is key. We can remove references to blockchain, cryptocurrency, p2p networks, and honestly who cares? People just want it to drag-drop and work. 
So at the end of the day users just see an application that is cheaper, faster, and more secure(after the iCloud hack not a hard sell) and functions how they expect it to. In essence, don't market the hammer, market the house you built with a hammer. 
@_date: 2014-07-19 16:36:44
Redundancy on multiple nodes. 
@_date: 2014-07-18 12:20:52

I think it would work better if the blockchain was a ledger for virus signatures along with any patches needed. Therefore if you found a large  virus and could patch it then you could earn a large sum for some sort of automatic tip in the virus software.

I used them as well for the Chicago conference. Was really impressed, and will use them again.

Great post. I've always thought direct incentives were a good idea. I found out about [tip4commit]( when I did a Bitcoin commit once, and have used it ever since for my Peercoin web work. You will get crappy commits, but every once in a while you will get some golden ones.
When I acquired Coingen.io from Matt, Luke-Jr had a great idea to put bounties on bitcoin pull reqs(since everyone shares the same codebase). [Gavin's double spend detection]( is brilliant, but its just sitting in the repo. If people could simply put Bitcoins on the completion of the issue I think we could move important things along. 
I've been too busy working on school and decentralized storage to get some funding to freelance it out. It is still on my todo list. I think its better to create a market for Bitcoin development, rather than people volunteer. After all digital incentives is why the Bitcoin network is so large. Do you think all those miners would work for free?
@_date: 2014-07-19 02:04:52
Awesome. Storj will be using this. 
@_date: 2014-11-25 02:10:09
To answer your question specifically(my nice answer was lost when I accidentally clicked a link) is that you have control where your file shards go. So if you have 50 shards, and 1000 farmers on the network you can randomly distribute them and the chance of the same entity holding 2 or more shards is quite small. You could do a very basic statistical function to get the exact number. You can also distribute your shards to entities you know or trust if you so choose. 
@_date: 2014-08-16 04:32:55

@_date: 2014-08-26 09:40:46
Agreed. And ask questions on parts you don't understand. Projects in development are not going to have the most polished documentation. 
@_date: 2014-08-19 04:20:38
Well miners and merchants do this with Bitcoin. At least with Storj they have something else to do with it other than sell. 
There is a constant need to buy Storjcoin to maintain the files, unlike Bitcoin when people only really buy it when they think it will go up. 
In essence Storj is a need. Bitcoin is a want. 
@_date: 2014-04-12 04:47:24
We expect somewhere between 3-5. You may also set this redundancy number manually. When we run the network live we which number is best, and go with that number. 
Well we can achieve syncing with a few hundred lines of Python. Just an app. We will add that soon.
@_date: 2014-06-24 12:15:34
Data can be spread out to hundreds of nodes all with a redundancy you set. Parties leaving and entering the network won't affect your data. 
Amazon = Trust
Storj = Verify with a hash challenge algorithm
@_date: 2014-12-07 19:08:56
Florincoin is the only coin that supports extra data of about 512 bytes. Bitcoin only allow about 40 bytes.
This is useful for metadata insertion described in the Metadisk and Storj whitepapers.
@_date: 2014-05-01 02:03:52
You are able to set that in the application. Typical is 3-4. The raw network data will tell us what the best redundancy level is.
@_date: 2014-07-19 15:51:27
That's really strange. Are you sure your checking the right network connection? If it works then its not on our end.
@_date: 2014-11-24 18:54:22
This is not an investment. It is purchase to early access to the software. 
Sure let us know if you have any questions.

Love to integrate sidechains or treechains, but that remains mostly vaporware at this point.

Its funded with the standard crowdsale. BitAngels has already pledged 250k from when we won the Texas Bitcoin Conference Hackathon. 
Some will come from the coins themselves that we own. Most will come from all the cool decentralized applications that we build.  
@_date: 2014-05-28 00:10:26
The original author of the StorJ concept was made by Bitcoin core developer Gregory Maxwell back in 2011. See the original Bitcointalk forum post here: 
I was inspired by his writing as well as additions to the idea from Jeff Garzik and Mike Hearn. Since late last year I've working on making StorJ a reality. Since building a fully autonomous network from scratch is kinda impossible I decided to work on blockchain based storage, with fully autonomous agents as a long term goal. That way we can incrementally build to the cool concept originally described.

About to get on a flight to the conference. What's going on tonight?
@_date: 2014-08-06 22:23:26
You mean like this?
@_date: 2014-08-26 17:09:47
Yes. I want to add in public graylist were you can opt-in to not host publically known contraband bits as Dan from Bitshares has called them. I choose defer that conversation till the technicals and more fleshed out on the privacy models. User control is good but I refuse to implement a system that will allow it to devolve to censorship. 
History repeats itself. Can't remember the country but they implemented a filter for cp, then courts decided a few years later to use it to filter "copyrighted" material. 
Any mechanism of that nature will require and an in depth discussion with our community, not just my ideas alone. 
@_date: 2014-04-12 01:45:09
Its because there is not many exit nodes. They have no incentive to run like Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-06-24 13:10:41
Yeah we are not about waiting. If sidechains come out then great, if not we just keep moving forward. 
@_date: 2014-08-16 11:13:26
Essentially we use something called a GVN or group of verification nodes. You get to choose the methods of verification whether it be smart contracts, decentralized application, oracles, etc. or a mixture of all of them. That way you can do the verification in a trustless manner that is resistant to 51% attacks and colluding nodes.  
@_date: 2014-04-24 05:08:26
It would be used small scale at first. Like a company board that wants to vote on a particular measure, or small local election. It would grow from there.
@_date: 2014-08-27 23:11:11
[Metadisk]( is your Dropbox killer. Storj is a platform, not an app.
@_date: 2014-04-11 01:34:22
We enforce redundancy at the network level. Will have no effect on the file availability, you just won't get paid for that period. 
@_date: 2014-08-16 11:17:30
 should have most of it. Also see the decks. Basically the amount of user space out there is an order of magnitude larger then all the servers in the world combined. Its kind of like saying oh google can just 51% the bitcoin network. Maybe in 2012 maybe but not now. There isn't enough computing power to compete with the Bitcoin network. In this there won't be enough hard drive space to compete with the network.
@_date: 2014-07-18 20:52:40
We already plan to reintegrate via a hard fork into the Bitcoin chain if sidechains or treechains become viable. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 14:21:22
There are many different ways to do this, but here are the ways we will be addressing those first. Essentially all files are supposed to be encrypted, and we can essentially fingerprint each additional copy with some extra data on the end. So to prove you have the data you have to actually store all 5. As far as the storing all 5 replications on the network, that data might be split into 200 small chunks. That data can be distributed randomly, so there should not be a way for your botnet to get enough chunks to have any effect on the data.
@_date: 2014-12-07 05:23:51

Storj is an ecosystem build around decentralized storage. We are currently working on our two flagship applications. 
[Metadisk]( - Which allows you to store data on the network.
DriveShare - Which allows you to sell your extra hard drive space. 
We have been incorrectly described as a Dropbox like service. That would be our application Metadisk. Storj is blockchain based, (you are forgetting some other good projects) Sia is quorum based, Maidsafe uses their own flavor of a P2P network. 
@_date: 2014-01-20 09:49:57

3) hash challenges.  
You take a seed, the file, and hash it and return the result. The merkle root of the challenges its in the blockchain to keep the requestor from cheating. 
@_date: 2014-07-19 16:09:01
Agreed. This is a balanced response. As this is a crazy market, and you should be careful. But now that you guys have given us a task lets take some time to get it done.
@_date: 2014-08-19 03:16:43
Because unlike a one time purchase storage space is a continual service. Therefore the coins are constantly being recycled. 
TD;DR less hodling, more using  
@_date: 2014-08-16 15:17:59
Well we see both being used for different applications and use cases. That's basically handled by the hash challenge algorithm. See the Metadisk paper and soon the Storj paper for more details on that.
Just kind of the industry standard. When I get DriveShare up we can get more solid data on that. 
@_date: 2014-07-14 16:44:03

Well that's a step in the right direction. Transparency is also key. Especially financial transparency. 
@_date: 2014-10-12 10:03:15
Have you taken a look at [Storj]( It is decentralized cloud storage. We use Bitcoin and the blockchain to offer encrypted, private, and cheap file storage without a central entity. Only you the user can access the files your store. Users are able to sell their extra storage space to the network as well.
@_date: 2014-02-28 07:12:22
@_date: 2014-01-22 00:27:35
Which is why I'm attacking storage first. Current VM tech needs to deal with the data leakage and data privacy issues.

It seems like it until you run the numbers. My jaw was on the floor for a good month when I realized how much everyone was overcharging. 
That 2 TB external hard drive on your desk? At Dropbox prices that will bring in $170/month. If you rent a server with a high amount of bandwidth the profit margin is insane. Using the best server I can find for $30/month it can generate a monthly profit of $13,696.
Forget your ASIC, go clear out all the hard drives at Best Buy.

[TorPath]( is current the best paper we have on the subject and fits this use case. It's difficult, and I always suggest that micropayments/microchannels. This particular use case its harder because you a providing a service to a network rather than a particular individual.

Bittorent is a technology which can be applied to other things. 
@_date: 2014-08-16 17:26:08
So the checks are independent from the filesize. So 100 GB file or 1 KB the hash sizes are the same. The idea is that you make heavy use of merkle trees and roots to summarize. So you can merge thousands of small files into one and verify just that one file. 
That way you can reduce the overhead required by orders of magnitude. 
@_date: 2014-04-07 05:24:10
Where did you read that?
@_date: 2014-07-21 20:54:23
You realize that Bitcoin already has Tor support right? 
@_date: 2014-09-18 03:55:02
Its really on the fence. Litecoin forked Tenebrix or something which was heavily premined, but something like a hard fork of something existing hasn't really happened in the 5 years Bitcoin has been around. People are not going to change platforms for a small change in fees. The reason has to be a significant negative or positive value proposition. 
@_date: 2014-05-01 02:26:53
Yeah this is actually something I'm really excited about. The coins being recycled might actually outpace the block reward. I have no idea how the economics will work, but I'm really excited to see what does.
@_date: 2014-04-11 14:53:23
Yes. There is a really high level paper that has been floating around. I have to ask someone what it was called. I can't remember the title off the top of my head.

Memorycoin 2.0 had a great idea for this. You vote on the coin employees and the blockchain pays them 
@_date: 2014-08-27 14:34:46
It wouldn't work. Your forgetting about market incentives. Demand for storage space goes us, price goes up, people add more space to the network to meet the demand and get the profit. If you use Bitcoin you can't enforce the proper incentives. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 01:41:09
For our system(Storj) no data is stored directly in the blockchain. You use the blockchain to keep track of everything. You can't sort large amounts of data in a blockchain because of bloat.
@_date: 2014-02-24 23:14:14
As per  I'd love to see system bounties on specific pull requests. Gavin's half finished double spend detection was just sitting in the repo last time I checked.

We are working on that right now. We were using some free file hosts for storing the encrypted chunks(for bootstrapping really), but we will start replacing that with Storj algorithms and user hosted chunks in the next few weeks.

Depends on the data contract, and the type of data Once the hard drive is filled up it audits the data every x number of minutes/hours/days. Its a pretty passive process should only use your drive a little bit. Now its a different case if you are actively distributing content as well which might bring up your read/write quite a bit. 
@_date: 2014-06-24 12:43:29
Amazon charges 3 cents / per gb per month. Hard disks are 4 cents for the life of the drive. So we break even at 4 months on a 2-3 year drive. 
Then again I already have a drive with extra free space that I'm not using. Already paid for the computer because I need it for other things. I can charge $0.02 if I wanted to.

It might work the other way around. Bitcoin guys will develop a micropayments client that integrates torrents. Ive already seen a workingish prototype of this. Proof of bandwidth is an illusive ghost. I'm not even sure its quite possible. 
The solution is just a micro payments channel and pay per chunk. Send me 1 MB, ok pay me for the 1 MB I just sent, sending you another 1 MB. No need for complex magic bandwidth algorithms. 
@_date: 2014-08-30 22:41:22
So Metadisk is basically a gateway for the Storj network. You can request that file(via its hash) from any node and it will retrieve it and put in on the server cache. 
The idea is simple. Do you really want to download all kinds of special software or do you want to just go to a website? Allows us to have our first apps cache andserve content via HTTP, but on the backend its been managed by a blockchain and other Storj code
@_date: 2014-05-30 20:43:14
This is incorrect. Proof of work does not solve all the problems of the network.

This could be done on Storj. The publisher uploads a let's say a movie to the network. The run their own Metadisk nodes that allow the user to stream the movie. A user could perhaps buy 25 licenses from a node, then market and sell them for a profit. 
Pretty cool idea. And not that hard to implement.

So as far as viable just check in the software in a few weeks.

Factom is the best way to deal with this. You can build the hashes into a mertkle tree to avoid the blockchain tx fees.

I'm not perfect. Could you point out the parts where it was confusing? I'm happy to re-record it.
This tutorial kind assumes that you went through some of the cold storage tutorials, and know the basics of Armory through the "GETTING STARTED" tutorials.

I'm using it for [Storj]( which is essentially decentralized storage. Uses the blockchain to keep track of coins like usual, but it also used to keep track of the files on the network.

You are vulnerable to attack even when its not connected. At any point and time your wallet could be exposed, and a keylogger could capture your password. 
With offline Armory on a separate computer the attacker has no vectors off attack. Key logger won't work, no blockchain sync required, and your wallet is not exposed at any point.
@_date: 2014-07-19 15:56:28
This is solved with file grouping. You only need to store the merkle root of the files in the blockchain. So you could store 100,000 files in a single transactions. 
@_date: 2014-12-12 23:36:06
We could use Bitcoin in the future if sidechains come out, but thats going to take a while, so we aren't planning on it right now.

Yes. We will be working on a feature like that. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 07:38:41
We are planning that at some point for our MetaDisk software. We actually are more for distribution than personal files. In that case just more than one person holds the access keys or the keys are public. That's a misconception about us. 
This isn't officially written anywhere.  The hard part is the micropayments described in our whitepaper.

There is no block reward only a standard transaction fee. Basically saying there would be little incentive for miners to validate and define those blocks.

Nah, you can run caching on large physical clusters using the distributed software. As long as as what you are looking for is somewhat used it should pop up quickly. Probably going to get a faster response from the guy down the street with popular query caching than Google's servers a couple thousands miles away. 
Also distributed systems can do cool things with more caching. Can I run a Google on my computer? No. Can you download a Google? No, but you can on a distributed system. 
tl;dr So on disk caching will blow your centralized indexing out of the water by an order of magnitude.

You are right in most cases. If you can reorder or have multiple block in a secondary chain then Bitcoin blocks as an ordering device doesn't make sense.

@_date: 2014-07-21 00:05:28
This is correct. I mainly just use the words Bitcoin Core contributor. The confusion probably lies in the rebranding from Bitcoin-Qt to Core which makes it sound like I'm a core developer. I've mainly just been doing edge stuff and trying to learn. 
As much as the /src stuff is interesting and good for the client I'm much more interested in some of the edge stuff first. If you looked in the /docs folder before I cleaned it up it was just a bunch of .txt files and whatnot. Its one thing to contribute its another thing to perhaps clean up the workspace to make things more readable for people smarter that myself. 
I've always had a problem with the fact that 10 or so people have a majority of the commits. The domain of knowledge is too small. The recent documentation made a huge step in the right direction. 
Storj will always be committed to Bitcoin as none of this would be possible without it. 
I just finished my bachelors last week and now am full time bitcoin. So I can now commit to spending a little bit of time per week just doing my normal cleanups.

@_date: 2014-07-18 15:45:13
This is going to be hard to answer on my mobile. 
1. Default redundancy is 3. User or application can set any redundancy they would like.
2. The node would be useful for storing very small files that won't be accessed that much or at all(backups). P2P solves that problem as well.
@_date: 2014-05-25 03:52:34

As everyone should with any new system. What your describing is a Sybil redundancy attack. You solve it with uniquely encrypted redundant copies. 
The rest of your questions should be answered by the Metadisk paper.

It sank in a storm. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 09:15:39
You have the right idea. We will most likely use this method, and then transition to a proof of resource algorithm. In this way we can avoid the whole delivery in two weeks(tm), which goes against the Storj deployment model. We release early and often. We would rather make it work, and improve it than show up with something 1 year late.
@_date: 2014-03-25 16:58:42
I'm not concerned with Bitcoin bloat as I know the Bitcoin blockchain will be replaced with time. Its already unsustainable. Lowering the byte limit just hurts metachains and does nothing actually useful. 
Two weeks(tm).
@_date: 2014-08-20 20:22:45
Funding is an excellent point. Gavin had an excellent solution to mitigating double spending, and it sat in the Bitcoin Core repo for 4 months. 
If Bitcoin gets replaced or dies it won't because of government regulation. It will because another coin with funded and active developer team has more features. 
The Storj model addresses the problem. But people want to believe that the problem doesn't exist. After all would you mine if you didn't get any coins?
@_date: 2014-12-20 18:34:53
Do the math on raw drive space vs. AWS, and show me your calculations. Its not cheaper. Especially if we are talking about extra disk space here, that is all sunk cost so its practically free. 
I kind of glossed over that because that is probably a whole paper. On the reward mechanisms you don't need complicated algorithms. Just really a tit-for-tat micropayments channel. You send me a few bytes, I send you a fraction of a cent. You can verify the hash to make sure its the correct data. Rinse and repeat. 
For something hacky the current microchannels/micropayments implemented in Bitcoinj would probably be sufficient.    
Great questions! You going to be around for the Test Group A launch today?
@_date: 2014-05-28 00:15:13

Good idea but at the end of the day only an idea. Their white paper has no working algos and tons of privacy and scalability flaws. 
@_date: 2014-11-24 18:45:34
Yes but the main problem is making it trustless. I can encrypt some data and put it somewhere and know that someone has not modified it through a one way function called hashing. When you start talking about computation there is no way to do that easily. Not impossible but the computer science behind making that work still has a long way to go. 
@_date: 2014-09-06 05:52:37
Client side encryption is key, the data needs to be encrypted before it even leaves your computer. All the software needs to open source and audit-able. Users should have fine grain control over the algorithms if they want which lessens the vectors of attacks because the data could be secured x number of ways. No central server means no monitoring point. We would prefer to use elliptical keys rather than user-password which can be brute forced.
I could go on, but I think you get the picture.

This is called the hostage bit attack. Basically shards are distributed in such a manner that you can't tell which shard belongs to what file. That is only something you the file owner know.

@_date: 2014-03-13 12:31:01
That's just a quick solution. Something that works now that you can make better later. You don't have to worry about memory inspection for an agent under normal circumstances. 
If nodes were attacked openly then its up the agents to be smart about it and survive. Here are some solution off the top of my head. 
1) Key shuffle. Because its a computer it can do things we are not used to. Can keep hundreds of wallets and shuffle the keys every few seconds. Should make physical attacks harder.
2) Multsig. Engage in a contract with another node or group of nodes. Now you must compromise m nodes to get they keys.
3) Empty sack. VPSes are cheap. Can get them for $2-$5 a month. Sure hack in to the agent. You only get prize of $1.50
These solutions could be implemented on different nodes using genetic algorithms. The network could learn which one works well, or maybe in combination.

We already did Test Group A, and you can run the downstream-farmer/node software and get up to about 100 GB. We have proved that it works, we are just working on making it scale.
Where are we repeating fundraising? 
@_date: 2014-08-16 12:38:38
Says the guy working on autonomous AI for Storj. Don't make it sentient yet please. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 09:52:52
Or just another fancy startup 2.0 name.
@_date: 2015-05-06 19:37:32
I agree. We are not doing any more events after this which will allow me to write much more code. 
We have been on the road promoting the tech to get more traditional people involves. Past couple of days I talked to the Belkin CTO, Digital Ocean CEO, BlockVerify, Tally Capital, and unnamed banks. 
When we launch the network (which we already have running is small scale) we want to have customers ready to go. This creates demand and an ecosystem. 
@_date: 2015-05-19 16:38:39
I just finished building something like this a few days ago. I don't see the need for consensus or a chain in this system. Whats the value add for those for an application? 
@_date: 2014-04-13 13:15:52
Have you been asleep for the past week? Sidechains. 
@_date: 2014-03-25 14:22:35
If I paid you for that would you change your tune?
@_date: 2015-05-20 17:39:50
Usrn are you on our community Slack?
@_date: 2014-08-06 01:15:16
Indeed we did, and we are pretty happy with it so far. 
@_date: 2015-05-20 13:53:03
You know that Edison got about $40k to start his workshop right? Inflation calc says that's over a million in today's dollars.
Our "lightbulbs" will be cheap with time but we only have 1000 of them. So we are going to give them to people funding the project. Everyone else can just wait. 
@_date: 2015-05-19 16:57:46
Oh thats an interesting case. A malicious miner aware of chainDB could add a malicious block it seems.  
@_date: 2014-04-11 18:54:08
Atlanta Tech Village?
@_date: 2014-04-13 04:59:54
Agreed. Literally all I do is try to clean up the repo docs and indexes. 
@_date: 2015-05-20 16:39:50
Why not Storj and Maidsafe?
@_date: 2014-02-28 06:32:18
Not only that but means you pay lots and lots for fees. It isn't scalable or quick. Storing anything but metadata in a blockchain just seems to be a bad idea. From my discussions with other Bitcoin devs they don't thing that part of their protocol is going to work either.
I'm working on multiple solutions to this. Their contract system actually might work quite well for the metadata part, but the storage part I don't think will work.
@_date: 2015-05-20 16:35:10
Notice there is no where to actually purchase that nor are we selling that. Just letting existing SJCX beta testers how much SJCX they need to have on balance when Test Group B starts.
We definitely are not asking for money. We have enough resources for Test Group B, although volunteers and developers are always helpful and welcome.
@_date: 2014-04-11 09:42:36
Yes. Shoot me an email, and we can arrange. We don't have format space yet, but we will soon.
@_date: 2015-05-20 19:17:49
Makes sense. The real cost is paying tx fees to Bitcoin miners. At scale it seems like you could bring down the cost to almost zero.
@_date: 2015-05-20 13:59:11
And it took 4-5 years to get all core developers hired. Imagine how many features Bitcoin we would have (side chains, micro payments, smart contracts) if Bitcoin was not just a hobby project but their full focus. 
@_date: 2015-05-06 21:24:10
Yeah we saw them yesterday. Should have a pic somewhere. 
@_date: 2014-01-12 19:06:44
I would just stick a bunch of GPUS in some 4U cases and stick them in a rack. 
@_date: 2014-08-16 16:04:51
Thanks. That's pretty cool. 
@_date: 2014-05-01 02:27:20
Buy, mine, or earn
@_date: 2014-03-25 13:54:56
@_date: 2014-03-13 23:56:43
Indeed. A new economy is forming. We don't need dollars anymore. Just Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2015-05-19 17:49:10
1) Do what Google does and multiple submissions. This is data not money, so double spends are ok. Therefore the same ChainDB tx is in multiple Bitcoin blocks in a row(lets say six), which means that the attacker would have to mine 6 blocks in a row (which gets very statistically unlikey).
2) Discard chains and use it as a notarization protocol. Applications can use their own local ordering, and validation. 
@_date: 2014-09-23 07:39:35
@_date: 2015-05-06 01:22:34
Look at  Should be useful. 
@_date: 2014-03-14 04:34:16
This is from the Texas Bitcoin Hackathon last week. I'm sure there will be more stuff coming from them in a few weeks. 
@_date: 2015-01-17 13:38:03
There are many technical reasons. Writing a whitepaper about most of them. 
Just realized the FAQ section explains none of that. At the Miami conference so I'll rewrite it in a few hours. 
Thanks for calling me out on that. 
@_date: 2014-09-23 07:39:00
You would increase the cost about 10x-100x. Quadcoptors batteries don't last very long at altitude. Not to mention charge time you would have to have drones going in and out of rotation, and constant usage would mean either the batteries or motors would fail after a few days. Then you are assuming that you actually have any power source in that area.
@_date: 2014-05-01 11:59:20
He he. I like that. 
@_date: 2014-06-24 11:53:01
Frontend applications like  handle that. I don't see why they would be. You are paying for storage space not cryptocurrency. If they do a chargeback then you stop hosting their file. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 07:48:03
Actually we use blockchain and bittorrent in the code currently. Might want to spend some more time looking around our code.
@_date: 2016-03-01 18:43:19
I tried to followed Chatham House Rules for most posts. We just posted loose summary points, not many direct quotes. 
@_date: 2015-01-30 04:06:48
Where to next? Back to BitPay?
@_date: 2014-08-16 15:52:37
Everything is encrypted chunks. So you don't even have a copy of the full file. 
@_date: 2014-01-21 04:07:05
I'm taking a node based approach, rather than a protocol based approach. That way you have something working that you can plug and play with the stuff you mentioned. There are a dozen ways you can make this work. 
@_date: 2014-02-09 22:24:51
lol. Wish I could buy low. Everyone starts a 0.01. 
I have a majority of the hashpower, so I seem to be the only one selling atm. 
@_date: 2015-01-03 18:33:19
What browser/os are you using? It a 3D globe using WebGL(I think). Some browsers can't display it.
@_date: 2015-01-17 03:32:01
Shawn from Storj here. I've always stated that proof of bandwidth is the wrong approach. You give me a byte, and I sent you a satoshi via a microchannel. We don't need invent fancy cyptographics or proofs. Its simply tit for tat.
@_date: 2015-01-03 19:59:59
You realize that we intend to use Bitcoin directly in the future right? We need SJCX for our pseudo-reputation system that I'm writing a paper on. 
@_date: 2014-06-06 08:44:45
We are already using this in one of the Storj web apps. We had a good laugh when we did. 
@_date: 2015-01-03 17:52:38
Actually you should read our whitepapers:
They go into detail on why Storj is cleaper, more available, faster, and more flexible. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 05:22:38
I find this hilarious. Hackers don't store your coins in an exchange because you will get goxxed!
@_date: 2015-01-17 16:38:26
More of a buzzword. Why?
@_date: 2015-01-17 04:25:23
Use the economics of the token to make it costly for Sybil attacks and other methods. So think of it as if like Ghash.io would lose all their money every time they had 51% of hash power.
@_date: 2015-01-04 19:33:50
I just started on the Storjcoin whitepaper. I can go in depth on there. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 00:35:14
@_date: 2014-12-16 16:35:34
 everything is open source. 
@_date: 2014-08-11 04:52:20
Yes, we are open source. Wouldn't have it any other way.
@_date: 2015-05-21 18:05:58
It is on top of Bitcoin. Counterparty is just extra metadata on Bitcoin transactions. 
@_date: 2015-05-19 17:15:28
It isn't. Just add a consensus layer, and collect everything to reduce fees.
@_date: 2015-01-03 17:54:23
When did you ask? We pushed out our first peice of software a few weeks ago. See 
@_date: 2015-01-04 00:43:13
See 
@_date: 2015-01-04 16:13:53
Use a tit for tat exchange model, with dual layer microchannels. Also read the GVN section of the Storj white paper for more. 
@_date: 2014-07-19 12:12:18
We actually expect not to reach the goal. The rest of the coins will be distributer via early mining and future crowdsales. 
@_date: 2014-04-07 01:34:14
This is incorrect.
@_date: 2015-01-19 05:05:34
BitStamp coins?
@_date: 2015-01-10 03:42:18
We had fun at CES. If you haven't been you have to. There was a giant Bitcoin booth. The empty BitStamp booth was funny. 
@_date: 2014-07-18 22:00:26
Just spreading Satoshi's good word.
@_date: 2015-01-04 07:46:41
@_date: 2015-01-03 20:56:49
@_date: 2015-01-10 03:33:16
You are correct from the public information. Been receiving communications staring late November. Our announcement was more driven by the start of the new fiscal year which it was posted on 1/2. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 04:28:53
Storj dev here. Bitcoinj has a really nice implementation of micropayment channels, just no one uses it.
@_date: 2015-01-03 18:02:00
Lead developer for Storj here. Take skim of our whitepaper here: 
If you some time shoot me a PM. Your field of study could provide some useful insight on the topology of our P2P network. We are looking an S3 type of application in the future so be good to get your experience and feedback there. 
@_date: 2015-01-22 15:23:17
Storj here. This is perfect for what we have been implementing. We have been using libtorrent for the underling data transfer. Shoot me a PM. Let's talk on how we can flesh this out.
Are are you structuring your micropayments? Hub and spoke is the best way to avoid insane tx fees.
@_date: 2015-01-17 12:41:01
More like if they are released. Don't see anything viable till probably end of 2016.  
@_date: 2015-01-17 16:36:49
If you read our docs you would find that we have already locked the token. No more than 500M will exist. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 00:28:07
You have to pay a tx fee when you establish and end a micropayments channel. This doesn't work really well when you need to do micropayment to dozens of people. You(A) establish a microchannel with a node (B), and then the other people(C-Z) can also establish a microchannel with (B). 
So everyone can keep their channels open, and you an do payments C-Z, by sending your payment through B first. You have to trust B, but you can send only a satoshi at a time so its not really a big deal.
@_date: 2015-01-04 06:05:24
We plan to use dual microchannels for payments so doesn't really affect us that much.
@_date: 2015-01-03 19:44:24
Read section 3 again. That includes 3x redundancy. Dropbox costs $99 a year for that space, while our raw costs would be ~$2. So you would charge somewhere between $2-$99. 
This is just guesses. Buyers and sellers decide their own prices. 
This data is stored on the network. Our other application DriveShare does that heavy lifting. MetaDisk is just a gateway node you can access via a simple web API so it just needs space to cache the files. 
@_date: 2015-01-17 12:39:22
We do use Bitcoin. Also see 
@_date: 2015-01-03 18:30:30
Well depends on the application. If you look at S3 bandwidth is actually kind of expensive at scale, $0.03 per GB (although I think inbound is free). For something like a CDN Storj would be perfect. I'll I'm doing is installing a simple application and hitting go, and now I'm passively earning. 
At the basis its P2P network so I'm going to get better speed, bandwidth, an connectivity. Way cheaper too. If I could charge EMC prices I could retire. 
Please do crunch the numbers on cost yourself. We have had some people doubt the numbers, then crunch the numbers and have their jaw drop. We don't have to maintain a data center, we just need enough people to download a software application. All hardware is just existing hardware, so our costs are mostly sunk costs anyways. 
As far as churn, yes there will be way more churn, but that is fine. Consumer machines should be 10x cheaper so churn won't cost anyone anything. The burden is actually covered by the hoster in our system.
I think the other thing you might be missing is that we can run the Storj software on a data center too. In that case the 3rd party data center doesn't have the keys to access the data. We can have the low latency, and free interdatacenter bandwidth for compute applications. Then if we need to move that data in or out, we can do that very easily via the P2P network.
@_date: 2014-04-13 04:51:10
Yup. The blockchain is essentially a big distributed ledger, but you can use it for more than just coin balances. 
@_date: 2016-03-01 20:38:57
Because no details were really discussed. All you said is correct, except to the "agreed [to] some stuff." There were no agreements other than an anti-harassment thing that should come out shortly.
There was no agenda because it was an unconference. Basically everything just happened on the fly. 
@_date: 2016-01-31 17:53:59
If you like riding roller coasters. 
@_date: 2016-01-31 17:47:02
I am the founder of Storj and I've bought $200 worth of drives for the project so far. I would not recommend putting anything but your spare drives, while we figure out all the economics and are still running test groups. 
Unlike Bitcoin miners if Storj suddenly goes moon, you don't need specialized hardware that takes months to get here. Just go cleanout your local electronic store of drives, and set it up in an evening. 
@_date: 2015-01-06 06:06:04
Storj has a booth here at CES. We can probably field some questions here, and ask them in person when we go the floor tomorrow. 
@_date: 2015-01-18 00:20:31
It read the $3 first. Oops. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 00:03:24
Such coin. Much invest. Wow.
@_date: 2015-05-19 16:42:45
Factom uses a federated server model. This seems to eliminate the server and have a more node based approach to generating blocks.
@_date: 2014-07-21 17:13:01
The Bitcoin core developers work on the protocol not phone apps. 
@_date: 2015-01-03 23:06:17
Gmaxwell's Storj was the inspiration, and where it takes the name. I figured it would be better to build the decentralized network first and then put the agents on top of it. 
Still want to personally build Gmaxwell's idea out. Storj just allows us to build the component parts. Probably could get pretty close now using our  application. We already have autodeploy code, but you still have to write a scraper and payment management system for a Bitcoin VPS provider.
@_date: 2014-02-07 17:59:48
Its possible.
@_date: 2015-01-03 18:32:06
Yeah, would like to take a look as well.
@_date: 2015-01-22 17:08:20
Well multiple peers have multiple chunks of the file so you should have to engage with multiple peers to download the full file.
@_date: 2015-01-04 00:34:23
Inside the system yes. Outside the system no. We can abstract away the crypto currency so you can pay in dollars or in Bitcoin. Using a token we can do some fun stuff with a pseudoreputation system to fend off Sybil attacks that we can't really do with Bitcoin. I'm just started a paper on it a few days ago. 
@_date: 2014-01-21 03:09:08
I am. I'm specifically focusing on storage because that is the easiest to implement. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 06:27:47
Thats why we have people that are smarter than me on the team like Josh who is working on that exact thing. 
@_date: 2014-01-26 01:30:45
Saw this happen. Pretty legit. 
@_date: 2015-01-03 18:31:16
Doesn't affect usability. Worst case takes an extra block. 
@_date: 2016-03-15 17:08:20
If you are still using Bter, you deserve to loose any money you still have in there. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 16:32:40
We may have that option early next year. Not decided yet though. 
@_date: 2014-08-16 15:52:45
To the moon!
@_date: 2015-01-16 20:37:58
@_date: 2015-01-22 18:16:31
Even in that case unless the file was several gigabytes then you end up paying more on the tx fee than you actually give to the seeder. Then even a good seeder just ends up with a bunch of dust sized inputs. Better to use hub and spoke. 
@_date: 2015-01-09 22:52:03
You mean the "secret vote" posted on the top of our forum right now.
@_date: 2016-01-31 17:32:37
Well Storj is named after StorJ, which was Gregory Maxwell's idea of a storage system run by AI. See here: 
Maybe I need to add in Asimov's laws when I get to the office on Monday...
@_date: 2015-05-20 15:55:05
We are assuming 100% of miners are not malicious/BFL.
@_date: 2014-07-22 04:42:28
The current "whitepaper" is terrible, but was written at a time when decentralized applications and counterparty didn't even exist. Currently rewriting a proper paper, to be critiqued by the Bitcoin Core devs. 
So we insert file pointers into the blockchain, file contracts, and other structured metadata into the blockchain. We need up 1 kb, while Bitcoin supports 80 bytes. 
Counterparty is currently used as the payment layer, while we have a separate data based blockchain for the metadata. We can combine these using either proof of existence, notary chains, or a hard fork to a more polished data based blockchain. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 23:10:00
I really like tip4commit when I contribute to the bitcoin source. I would suggest that.  
@_date: 2016-01-30 20:41:55
The list maintainer seems open to input. Why not submit your suggested changes so it can be made better more everyone else?
@_date: 2014-04-11 09:35:56
We are aware. That's all I can say about that. ;-P
@_date: 2017-03-07 12:21:08
Yeah the fees are insane. We are building micropayments for counterparty to help solve this. 
@_date: 2014-09-23 07:06:33
Linked you to a paper. Don't chase proof of bandwidth. Many have tried(including myself).
@_date: 2015-01-09 22:47:52
Not factual. Actually most of these purchasers contacted me before the price when up. I could not accept any coins until it has been approved and discussed. Furthermore, we couldn't accept any more coins until the new year for financial reasons. 
I modified the vote this morning to have a cap because people bought up that point. 
Please fact check.
@_date: 2014-12-17 07:40:07
You should read it then. The opposite is true. Way more for general and content distribution than personal storage. 
@_date: 2016-01-31 17:29:38
2.5 PB and 949 users at last count. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 03:01:51
No details its just on the todo list for now. We have a lot of work to do before we even start to think about direct Bitcoin integration.
@_date: 2016-01-31 18:00:09
Information is a bit dated. So we added the DHT in the middle of Test Group B. So the farmers are connecting to the central web server AND also the network at large. We plan to kill the server at some point, but its useful right now as another point of reference to the raw network data. 
Lot of the other fun stuff is going to be added in test group:
@_date: 2015-05-19 17:07:17
The bitcoin blocks themselves (that they are inserted into) are the history markers. 
@_date: 2016-01-31 17:36:15
Everyone knows Bitcoin mining is more dangerous: 
@_date: 2014-07-19 16:05:55
Have you even tried our first app? It was released a few days ago on our forums. 
@_date: 2016-01-31 17:53:28
Thanks for being a tester! You are awesome. Yeah I dropped about the same for extra drives in my existing rig. 
Like I said above if things go moon, just go clean out your local electronics store when the numbers actually support that. 
@_date: 2016-01-31 18:04:25
We aim to be an object storage platform like Amazon S3. More secure, faster, more private, and cheaper. To use the platform you don't have to know a thing about Bitcoin.  
Not really publicized yet as we are still working on it. Website here:
 
@_date: 2017-03-28 23:05:37
You clearly didn't read the Storj blog post on the migration. If you did please tell me what point  was. 
@_date: 2016-01-07 21:41:31
I don't think this would work for something like search, BUT you could have embedded content which you could pay for in micropayments. So imagine if you googled "The Martian" are were able to just click the play button right in the search, and pay for it per minute.
@_date: 2016-01-30 22:25:37
Then keep your mouth shut. 
@_date: 2014-11-24 18:41:42
Well this is blatantly false. Look at 
We have committed almost everyday. 
@_date: 2016-01-31 17:49:08
Thankfully hard drives have utility outside just the Storj network.
@_date: 2016-06-18 18:13:56
What's the 2nd link supposed to mean?
@_date: 2016-06-27 00:34:28
Should all be working now. Turns out we accidently merged a work in progress pull request, and it auto deployed. Changed our process and should be all fine and dandy now. Thanks for pointing it out. 
@_date: 2016-06-24 19:45:56
Fixed. Was a GUI side bug.
@_date: 2016-06-24 17:24:51
Consensus is pretty much irrelevant when it comes to decentralized storage. Blockchains don't scale past 7-10/tps. Most cat sharing picture sites handle more data than that.
The maturity of the tools for putting files on the network are the most important.
@_date: 2016-06-15 17:16:17
Cool reminds me of Tierion.
@_date: 2016-06-29 13:07:30
Sorry 1 TB is $150. Market rates are $30. Storj charges $15. 
@_date: 2016-06-30 20:32:29
Yeah doing so might be a direct violation of section 512, and they devs might be liable for those types of content.
"1) not receive a financial benefit directly attributable to the infringing activity"

Started farming for Storj yet or tried uploading any data?
@_date: 2016-06-18 18:11:44
It doesn't matter. Don't store your coins in there. 
@_date: 2016-06-18 22:10:29
Don't give your Bitcoin keys to 3rd parties. Period. That is the issue here. 
Coinbase is used to buy/sell Bitcoins to your bank. Makes sense that an investor would be a bank. 
@_date: 2016-06-24 19:45:45
Sorry about that. GUI side bug is now fixed. 
@_date: 2016-06-24 18:26:38
Looks like there is bug in the GUI that are investigating. Mind using command line or you want me to ping you when we fix it?
@_date: 2016-06-24 15:57:51
Coin price is only a short term indicator. I'd stay the real indicator is amount of data stored in the network and growth in the rate at which data is being stored.  
@_date: 2016-06-24 14:40:35
So there is the Storj protocol, which is the decentralized network. Then the Storj bridge service, which sits on top and makes it dead simple to use. 
Kind of think of it like running your own Wordpress, or having Wordpress.com host it for you.
@_date: 2016-06-24 14:21:40
We released our v1 on June 1st, and are now several releases ahead of that. Our object storage product build on top is in beta.
@_date: 2016-06-24 17:14:26
^ According to the lead developer of Sia.

Where is the whitepaper?
@_date: 2016-12-26 18:35:04
Dunno. We paid out $22k for last month.  Depends how your hardware and how good a farmer you are. 
@_date: 2016-11-30 13:46:26
If you were to get big would you consider using using a Bitcoin bases distributed storage network to serve the data instead of a server?
@_date: 2016-12-02 04:42:29
Probably going to have to wait a couple days. It's really bad. Only way to get around it is to send a child-pays-for-parent transaction. 
@_date: 2016-12-02 05:47:15
I dunno if this will work but you may be able to send some coins to that wallet with a really high fee. Then use the tiny amount left and the new confirmed coins to do this method. 
@_date: 2016-06-29 02:18:42
Because we only have about 15%, only 5% (of the 15%) has only been used for test groups and community volunteers. The rest has sat untouched since 2014, and will be used to fund the micropayment hubs that make the network work. More details on that here:
@_date: 2016-12-25 13:42:32
You realize you have to pay tax and a penalty on everything you take out right? You just lost 1/3 without buying a single Bitcoin. Should have bought with your IRA. That is tax free. 
@_date: 2016-12-24 21:07:07
In my experience if you reach out to support they will honor the original buy.
@_date: 2016-12-27 01:10:29

@_date: 2016-11-22 18:51:50
U2F is a pretty big deal. 
@_date: 2016-12-25 16:31:16
Well 10% penalty, and 25% tax. If Bitcoin goes moon then you have to pay ~40% too. 
@_date: 2016-12-02 05:24:41
Unless you sent every last bit on your wallet to someone else most likely there is some change that you can use.
@_date: 2016-12-26 12:56:52
We are storing 1,500 TB of data so I think that is proof enough. 
@_date: 2015-08-26 15:42:19
With the economics or the counterparty asset part? 
@_date: 2015-08-14 14:08:02
Yes we use the Bitcoin blockchain. It is time proven to work. Maidsafe 's project is of a larger scope, which is why they have been in development for 10 years. 
@_date: 2015-08-04 19:43:55
Have a whitepaper or something to describe what is going on? Why not put the source on Github?

Storj here. We are currently running Test Group B, guess that kinda counts as release. 
We use different tech from them. Both should be relatively secure. 
I think the both have their strengths and weaknesses.
@_date: 2015-08-04 19:41:03
Doesn't look like it. Seems to use Bitcoin microtransactions like we are.
@_date: 2015-08-25 21:14:16
The economics of distributed storage doesn't work without an external coin. Note Storjcoin is a Counterparty asset. Technically its just a colored Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-07-20 23:03:57
Where is this peer review? Have not really got any new questions on the paper in a long time. 
@_date: 2015-08-14 16:56:14
We probably won't remove the barrier anytime soon. You are not mining, you are providing a service. So we can use that to offer disincentives like losing your SJCX if you fail audits or lose files. It allows to only get only serious users as well. 
We if we in desperate need of more capacity we will drop those limits down significant (maybe $5).
@_date: 2015-08-05 20:07:42
@_date: 2015-08-26 15:47:16
Sub-satoshi payments are the boldest case. The other gets into economics. You don't want an external token on a resource driven network. If you were to pay all Bitcoin miners in Litecoin. If the Litecoin price drops in half then miners should drop of because of lost profit, when actually you need more hashpower.
External token means you are not at the whim of external factors.
@_date: 2015-07-20 23:02:07
I think another paper needs to be written about incentives that's why its vague in the Storj paper. 
I'm currently working with project like BitMesh and JoyStream to create a standard for micropayments. I've described the incentives many times and it is in our documentation but we need to have a standard payment system that everyone will use to avoid rewriting it in the future. 
@_date: 2015-07-21 21:00:24
Just more proof that these types of systems are needed.
@_date: 2015-07-29 12:20:09
Edge cases man.
@_date: 2015-08-04 20:38:45
Bitcoin micro-transactions is the old way to pay people without incurring huge fees. Its $0.03 per transaction on Bitcoin, and we want to pay everyone every hour or shorter.
@_date: 2015-08-04 20:37:33
Well just doesn't have to be one of those crazy 16 page papers. Just 1-2 pages that describe what going on.
@_date: 2016-02-29 02:41:08
Coin age with a 30 day cap, and not valid after a certain date means old coins will have the same value as regular coins. Peter Todd might have a better implementation than that. Again this thread is just to discuss the idea itself rather then going through the technical implementation that fends off attacks. 
@_date: 2016-02-07 16:34:22
I'll be there. Looks like a great list this year.

So people can be honest, and talk about products/projects that have not been publicly released yet. 
Bruce said it better: 
"People act differently when it's recorded or media -- they tend to try to win arguments sometimes rather than compromise. So for this- we keep it private like a dinner or conversation in the hall."
@_date: 2016-02-27 16:47:48
Started with examples of people sending 80 BTC as a transaction fee, then an example about how aviation really worked to solve human error problems. Takeaway is that we should think about how to avoid human error on Bitcoin.

@_date: 2012-07-29 21:31:48
Yeah, you make very good point. The problem is not legality, it's how threatened large payment companies feel by Bitcoin. Why pay these translation fees like 2.9% + $0.30 or so for Paypal. Once you start receiving large payments or a large quantity that adds up. Bitcoin transaction fees? &lt;$0.01
@_date: 2012-08-23 00:32:43
Microlending and microdonations seem to really by the popular theme there. Perhaps this is a way I could go. 
Since you can download android apps from any market I could totally see android market with bitcoins being techincally possible. Seems like it would be the most challenging to pull off though.

Something that Peter Todd brought up. You need the proofs and data or it doesn't work. We have been communicating and working with the Factom team, but have no plans to integrate until I get an API to play with. I am currently an advisor for them. 
On an unrelated note I've been building a rough notary protocol on Storj that should be able to handle both. Will release details when it is done.

Never understood the get off my blockchain argument. 
@_date: 2015-09-17 17:05:09
Yeah you need the token for the network to function, but that doesn't mean you have to expose the end user to that. 
@_date: 2015-04-16 17:52:43
So we don't have the concept of mining. Mindlessly printing coins isn't working that well for Bitcoin. Farmers are getting coins from people that are storing their files on the network. 
Lets explore by edge case:
Random - If I'm paid by the network why can't I generate millions of fake files just to get paid more?
@_date: 2015-04-05 20:43:39
Locally for now, but Cassandra like DHT might make sense.
@_date: 2015-04-17 02:00:26
Probably has something to do with the Factom tips. Let me ask.

Absolutely everything and absolutely nothing. 
@_date: 2015-09-03 13:31:46

Looks like the VPS host was having some trouble with data center: 
*sigh* Just makes the point that we need decentralized storage. 
Note the paper was written before we decided to go with Counterparty. At some point I'd like to talk about how we use Storjcoin X in a unique mattern, and how it supports our system. My main focus is the code not a 3rd whitepaper right now though :-P
I think you are confusing us with Maidsafe, they don't use blockchain tech. Our system heavily relies on Bitcoin.

Think the operating word is had.
Customers mainly. Port all the APIs to support Coinbase. Now Coinbase becomes the dominant payment processor. 
Not talking about a buyout, more like a $1 sale and Coinbase hires a few devs and takes over Bitpay services. Would be worth it to transition over a bunch of customers without a hastle.
@_date: 2015-09-17 19:04:06
Reliability. Sia is checking the files every 2 weeks, while we are currently checking every 15 seconds - 1 minute. With challenges so long Sia can't really guarantee your files will be around. Economically we are paying farmers 10x-25x more than Sia. Which is why I think they only have 20 farmers on their network.
That being said Sia is an awesome project, just the numbers are off. There are some technical things they did correctly that I would like to take more of a look at.

At the end of the day you need a bit of both. Technical assertions, and data to back it up. Mostly why I choose the push development via Test Groups. Even the most awesome whitepaper can fall apart in the wild.

*What prevents Alice from passing different records to different people?*
If the data is hash addressable, then that is impossible because hashes are immutable. 
*Bob needs to be able to check that Alice haven't published any alternative records, and to do this he needs all records to be visible.*
But Factom doesn't store any data, so how could Bob check any of the records in the first place?

I disagree. I'm not smarter than Satoshi, but his/her algorithms are quite useful when applied. Satoshi fundamentally solved the Byzantine Generals problem which is a huge step forward in build better distributed systems.
Your points 1-6 are small scale. You are not going to convince people and businesses to use Bitcoin more than they already have. 
Sony hack was a problem. 73% of people not trusting the cloud that they store all their data in is a problem. Bitcoin is trustless and has not be hacked yet, so we are trying to apply Bitcoin to those problems.

Pretty easy to create chains with chainpoint using signatures and the metadata field. Most use cases don't need chains though, so haven't speced it out. 
You don't need to have a chain for that either. Alice just needs to pass Bob the Ri receipt + data.

Find that pretty interesting that you set it up that way. Litecoin is pretty much a copy from Tenebrix, which is very close to the Bitcoin source.

I find it a bit funny that you included Uniquebits as a source. I though I was supposed to be bad at reading but it says right in the documentation that is doesn't work with Factom:
"Secondly it is not possible to trustlessly outsource this publication, for example with Factom's merkle tree scheme. If your protocol involves a third-party in the publication that third-party can put you in a position of being unable to prove you did not commit fraud as you can't control what publications they make on your behalf."

Isn't this more of an addressing system than storage? That is at least what I gather last time I read the IPFS whitepaper. 
If it is storage how are you doing audibility and redundancy. i.e. How can I ensure that they file I'm looking for is actually there and not dropped. Sounds like you are using federated nodes right now.

From what I understand this is a content addressing system. So instead of entering in a URL, you enter a unique id(a hash) and it can go find the data by its content. Very useful for stopping MITM attacks.
Think of it this way. If I request cat.jpg how do I know I'm getting the correct cat.jpg if I've never seen it before. You could serve me dog.jpg and just call it cat.jpg. But if I refer to it by its hash f5436... I can mathematically prove that I have the correct file. Furthermore I don't have to go to a central domain. I just ask my peers who has file f5436(cat.jpg), and then retrieve from anyone. 
 
We built something similar last year for   
So from my understanding Ethereum, Maidsafe, and Storj are about the actually storage of data. IPFS is a great way of finding and addressing data in a P2P system like 3 you mentioned. If this matures we would be happy to use this in Storj.

While this is a great idea it lacks something I'll call "critical mass." Bitcoin is still a niche market, which means you only have small amount of users who actually have and use Bitcoin. An even small portion of that are going to be interested in your product or service. This is vs something Kickstarter(ish) were the only hurdle is people wanting your product, vs wanting your product and having Bitcoin to spend on it. 
This is why  only has a couple of projects funded. Basically Bitcoin needs more market share of the global payment market before you can expect to raise anymore than a few hundred dollars.

Developers need good documentation to be able to write all the cool Bitcoin apps we see. PM me if you want a little guidance on how to help.
Also if you run a Bitcoind instance as part of a service or webapp pay attention. You will probably need to rewrite your code for Bitcoin-cli. Don't worry, changes should be quite minor.

Many of the core dev have much invested in Bitcoin, so unless you held a gun to their head I doubt they would be bad actors. 
Simple fact is that anyone can review the code at any time. It only takes one person to say something. There are probably 100+ programmers writing code based on Bitcoin or for Bitcoin. This can be someone rewriting the entire hash functions or just making a simple app. Everyone is going to notice.

Agreed, at least logically this would make sense. You don't even have to sell them on the exchange, just simply sell them to the next customer who buys at a higher bid price. 
If I buy at $80 and the price goes down they expect me to honor the deal and pay $80. So if I pay $80 and the price goes up, then they can just pocket the money and say oh well "fraud blah blah"

BitPay and other Bitcoin companies actually take on all the volatility risk out of Bitcoin for merchants. The user pays in Bitcoin, it is immediately converted to USD, and the merchant will receive the payment in USD at the end of the day. So if the merchant charges $5 for an item, then they will receive $5 at the end of the day, regardless of the Bitcoin price for that day.

Saw you had Peercoin on there so I registered. Your verification process is a little much though.
@_date: 2013-10-21 15:40:36
Peercoin is another cool one to look at. It introduces Proof-of-stake, and is from the same developer as Primecoin. 
I think its a good idea to buy the good altcoins. Are you really going to miss $10 on each? $10 worth of Terracoin before the bubble I think was worth a ~$10,000 at the top of the bubble.
@_date: 2013-10-24 15:28:31
I know. That is why I'm doing doing it. I'm building apps and services, and there is no documentation to help me do it. So sometimes if you want something you have to build it yourself.

You my friend need to read up on Peercoin. Address is 
That problem is pretty much solved with proof-of-stake. Actually it rewards new users. Just by holding on to their coins they are able to gain a small "interest". 
Yes it does mean that coins will be emitted forever, but only at about 1% I think. Long term we have no idea what will happen with Bitcoin, when we grow close to the 21 million cap. Will the transaction fees actually be able to sustain a large mining network. With Peercoin we don't care, just means everyone will be doing proof-of-stake blocks.
@_date: 2013-11-26 16:12:55
I wouldn't invest without doing research into why Bitcoin will grow. We have been doing about 10x a year, but you also have to understand why to make smart decisions.

Basically what we have here is a 'Murka problem. Perhaps we should have bitpounds and bitquarts to make everyone happy.

Still worth learning about. Proof-of-stake solves some of proof-of-work's security flaws.

Wouldn't really work the way you would think it would. That is only supported by some hosts though. 
@_date: 2013-10-21 17:47:45
Peercoin's value added is proof-of-stake.
Primecoin's value added is prime numbers as proof-of-work. 
They are not an evolution. They are both different coins, which try different things. Perhaps proof-of-stake could be added in the future, but at this point there is no reason to.

Yes actually they could. There are altcoins out there with CPU based algos. I would mine those and then trade them for Bitcoin if you want.
@_date: 2013-10-21 19:35:59
At this point Bitcoin is still an experiment. Wouldn't buy more that you a willing too lose. Right now we are in a very speculative stage. People are buying because of huge fluctuations. This is good, people are trying and using Bitcoin. But for your Bitcoin to be safe we need to switch from a speculative mode to a more economic mode.

The affected version matches the version of SMF that BitcoinTalk was running. This would allow them to upload their attack script into the /avatar directory. They could then query those files client side, and then they would do their work. So what you want to look for in your logs is the first reference to ANY of those files.

CPU mining is an order of magnitude slower than a GPU. We are talking hundredths of a cent and thats if the malware mining was running all day. Going with the published hash rates of a regular desktop CPU which is more powerful than mobile CPU, and some back of the napkin calcs. 
At a hash rate of 1.4 megahashes you would get around $0.07 if the person *left their iPad plugged in for 3 months unattended*. So it would be 2,800 devices mining 24/7 for 3 months just to get 1 BTC. Because the hashing process is maxing out the processor and would make using the device almost impossible to use, your app would be found out and blacklisted pretty quickly. The person using the tablet would run out of battery in about an hour or two, or most of the devices would just fry themselves from overheating

I've already bought some 1 BTC from Coinbase with no problem at all. I was beginning to like them a bunch. I wanted to buy something with Bitcoin, but keep the coins I had so I bought coins to replace what I had spent. Few weeks later I see that my order has been cancelled.

Correct me if I'm wrong but I don't think this will work until the coin cap has been reached and miners live off the fees.
Consider this. Miner  is creating normal blocks. Miner  is creating double sized blocks with double difficulty. Miner  is going to create two blocks in the time it takes Miner  to make one. Therefore if we consider average fees of 0.25 btc a block(best case). Then miner  ends up with 50+ btc and miner  ends up 25+ btc.

Bitcoin is not anonymous, its pseudonymous. All transactions are public and in the blockchain. If you expose one identity you can simply track it through the chain. There are methods that you can use to do anonymous transactions, but again the core protocol isn't built around anonymity.

People assume that fiat currencies are stable, buts probably because they live in a nice first world counties with large economies. You have to think globally. There are counties which have experienced huge hyperinflation(Argentina), levy that wipes out 50% of their savings(Cyprus), or had their local currency completely wiped out(Zimbabwe). In all these cases Bitcoin is a much more stable.

@_date: 2013-09-29 22:15:43
It can be an investment. Let's break it down in terms of just economic factors. 
Unlike the fiat currencies you and I are use to which are inflationary, Bitcoin is deflationary. Fixed amount of coins, simple means you can't print off money like the feds(if this is a good or a bad thing is a different discussion). 
So if I have a $100 it is worth $97 of spending power a year later due to inflation. Due to the fixed amount of coins, and the growth of Bitcoin as a market my spending power increases over the year. This time last year 1 BTC could only buy $10 worth of things. Now it can buy $129 worth of things. This has held true since its creation. I've heard the 10x per year number thrown around alot. Used to be a time were 10,000 BTC(worth &gt;$1 million now) could only buy two pizzas. 
An investment the action or process of investing money for profit or material result. So buying coins at a lower price, and selling them or using them at a higher price earns you profit or some material result. Therefore buying Bitcoin does fit the textbook definition of an investment.
**tldr; Bitcoin can be considered as an investment.**

Just look at the blockchain fork earlier this year, major problem but fixed in a few hours. The protocol and code is open, and the blockchain is public. Even now we are constantly making improvements, and anticipating future problems. If something is broken everyone in the Bitcoin community will have $2 billion reasons to fix it ASAP. 
Lets not forget about altcoins. Many people like to hate them, but they can act as a failsafe if the worst happens.

Looks like they snuck it into the user avatars folder. I found it here:  
Other than images from imgur the only other resource they seemed to have loaded was /useravatars/muse.mp3
Yeah I don't see a malicious javascript payload anywhere in this script. It's well commented, and just all part of the animation. Mostly references to imgur and soundcloud. Checking the mp3 as we speak.
Based on what CoinSheep said and the code I think I can say that there is no malicious code in here. This was an elaborate prank. If the attacker was trying to steal "all the Bitcoins" I doubt it would have come with fanfare and animations. Code doesn't point to any strange resources. Looks like the attacker was able to upload his script via the avatar portion of the forum. Pretty common attack vector for message boards.

See Bitcoin securities. 
Bitcoin is just a means of value transfer. A reasonable analogy is that a dollar bill is just a green piece of paper, but people will accept that green piece of paper for goods and services. Bitcoin is just a series of bits, but people will also accept those bits for goods and services. 
We simple assign imaginary value to these things, and somehow it all works out.

Actually not necessarily. It really depends how you implement it. You could have a node that buys its own hosting, updates itself, controls itself, and launches child nodes that are also independent of which it has no control.

Indeed. But it makes double spends easily detectable. People think double spends are super easy. Its more like hitting a dartboard across the room. Even with a large amount of hashing power there is no guarantee you will hit the next block.

Yes you are right. Essentially the smart card will blindly sign any transaction which is why you need a second authentication method like a phone. 
The advantage of the smart card is that you must physically posses the card to complete the transaction. Is it better than a hardware wallet? No. Is is it way cheaper but also offers a high level of security? Yes. 
If you can stick a screen on it then you get the same security for a much much cheaper price.

More people playing with the core source is good. Bitcoin is the big leagues. Let people play around in the altcoin sandbox because there is good ideas that come out of there all the time.

It certainly is a solid concept, I think it just will require time for the Bitcoin market to mature. It you didn't make Bitcoin a central part of it, and just made it so called embedded crowd funding I'm sure some VC will probably throw some money at you(it has enough buzz words). 
I hated web programming too until I learned about Python + Flask. Basically I can program like normal in Python, and then add in the web bits in Flask to glue it all together.

This makes the most sense.

You are forgetting Peercoin and Primecoin.
@_date: 2013-12-24 22:01:35
You are making one very large assumption. That the network or the devs won't make core changes to protect the network.

Maintaining the backend for an integrating with an alt-coin takes a bunch of work. I.E. That time could be better spent working on their Bitcoin exchange will always earn most of their profit.

No problem. 
Sure, I'd love to to talk on your show. Yeah I'll take a question list to get some solid answers to the basic stuff, then I'll be happy to field some question from you and/or your listeners.

No real good documentation. You have to hang around the main bitcoin forum bitcointalk and compile the binaries for your cluster yourself. What are they running?

If that's the case then every investment is a ponzi scheme

Which is why I said fully verified. You can still accept at 0 confirmations if you would like. 
@_date: 2013-08-28 20:44:25
Yeah you are supposed to work on the other branches, and then just push to master once you have a release. Just the way Git works.

The iPhone wasn't successful for being a good phone. It was successful because it allowed developers to build killer apps that made the phone worth getting. The iPhone would be nothing with apps like Angry Bird, Candy Crush, etc.
Same thing for Bitcoin. Right now its just kind of in its starting stages. But then you realize Bitcoin is not just a currency, but a platform. Remittances (people sending money back home) is a $500B market. People are charged up to 10% of what they are sending. With Bitcoin that fee is $0.06 per transaction. What you need is just someone to build a business around it that which makes it cheap and easy. Bitcoin has a $2B market cap, so $500B added to that is a good amount of growth. That is just one killer app. I can think of dozens of others. You only have to take over 4% of that market to get your 10x growth in a year.

Yeah, I'm planning to adding a wallet on there too at some point.

Mining Primecoin would have been a better option

Yeah I talked to him a bit. He says they are going to have another meetup in October.
@_date: 2013-11-24 02:57:09
i.e. zero percent?

Can you post your primecoin address?

Syncs in about a minute. 12 minutes to full confirm vs 60 minutes. 
Gamebreaker though is the transaction fees. Transaction fee is hundredths of a cent for Terracoin. I maintain a free Terracoin faucet which has sent out over 4,652 transactions. You know how much that would cost me with the Bitcoin transaction fee? About 2.319 BTC or $286.9..... 
So screw that. Terracoin is perfect for micro-transactions.

Mobile wallets are not particularly secure. I wouldn't store much coin in them.

[Even Wu Tang Clan says diversify]( 
I have holdings in BTC, LTC, TRC, and a bit of ELC. All the others I just have a little bit of.
I'm mining TRC with my 6950, and it does nicely. Its usually one of the most profitable coins to mine.

Thanks!

I seem to be the only one taking care of the docs at this point. Want to help out?
@_date: 2013-06-27 00:57:00
Aw man I wish I was home.

Don't forget about PPC and XPM.
@_date: 2013-10-30 14:59:15
Agreed. Not to mention it has broken several world records. 
@_date: 2013-11-12 06:33:53
Regulate how?
@_date: 2013-12-04 21:04:35
Cool. community doesn't seem do understand that diversity is key in any ecosystem. Their loss. I'l take the cheap coins and then have a good laugh later.
