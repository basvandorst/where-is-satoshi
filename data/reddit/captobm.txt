A country where they need to educate their masses to build toilets in their homes in 21st century are warmly welcoming bitcoin. That's a good news and I hope it solves their problems too.

As someone said in a post. Your not at loss unless you've actually sold your BTC.

Better get a mining rig. That'll do the job

I just know the transaction fee you pay is actually called miner fee which goes into the pool and it is used to reward the miners for their computational power.

In 2014 or 2015 I went to the deep web, explored it a bit and came to know about Bitcoin, at that time it was at $250/BTC and it was a big news for people into it. Bitcoin reached $250. I sold my Xbox to buy some BTC. A decision I am proud of. Those turned into $15000 in almost 2 years and then I would just buy the dips sell when the price was a bit up. What I wanted to do the most was to actually use my BTC to buy things and that feels good. 
But I believe Bitcoin had to stop at some point. I mean how high can you go. There will be people to pull you down. As it started to get mainstream attention more and more eyes started watching it. To be honest crypto and blockchain pose a serious threat to these traditional ways of doing business and transactions. All this can very well take the power from the  elite 1% and give the power back to the people and of course the elites and governments would never let that happen.
Since the market is so volatile and unregulated. It makes me sad to see how such a small percentage of people can decide what the world should have and what not. Fuck them. 
Make Bitcoin great again.
