Id guess: because greed. Psychologically, the idea of selling half and having a future cry  over potential lost profits makes us humans want to keep it all.

"breaking all known support levels"
Are you forecasting a crash?
@_date: 2014-07-09 19:41:25
Nope, im still on my phone. Its a risky strategy, buying immediately after a crash, but it would make money in 90% of crashes.  You have to be prepared to watch prices go lower still tho, you may not be buying at the very bottom.
I should get out of here and try @_date: 2014-07-09 06:50:28
I think I might. Try to get back some of the $$ that evaporated out of my lifevthe last 5 years. Things are looking up at the moment,  from how shit they've been since 09 or so

Same here.  The baby boomers are laughing because they all bought their house to live in plus a rental property or two, back when house prices still had an element of reality.
Thrre was a slight dip during the GFC but no real crash. Yet.

Ps when the stock market crash comes, as it will, put all the money you can get hold of and put it into an index fund a day or two later. Stock markets always overshoot and bounce a day or two later. You'll thank me 1 or 2 years later, as youll have enough money to put a decent deposit down on your new house! On phone so no sources,  but the net is full of charts showing what happens in a stock crash.  Have a look if you dont believe me

Problem is: when the housing crash comes, all those frustrated first home buyers are going to jump in and compete with each other (and me!).  This might not be that great if the banks reduce lending and get all fussy about who they lend to, as happened during the GFC

Aliens might steal all the bitcoins. Is that really better than some back country hillbilly getting anal probed?

No, it's because of your assertion that anything not Linux is not a "real OS".
Just because its not linux, doesn't mean its automatically inferior and some kind of lesser OS. And at least Windows can usually be set up and configured without a myriad of text command lines.
The company I work for uses Windows servers and desktops exclusively and it works really well.  Don't insult me and my fellow windows sys-admins by trying to make out that Windows is not a "real OS".

If youre wondering why that comment garnered so many down votes,  I'd be happy to explain to you why

If this comment had been made in the 90's or early 2000's, you'd be right.  Windows has come a long way since the bad old days of NT4.0. That was indeed a pile of shit and needed regular (monthly?) reboots because it had memory leaks which meant that memory allocations weren't handed back to the OS once an application had finished using that memory. Result: server would run low on available memory after a few weeks of uptime.
Since then, i think MS have started taking the OS business a little more seriously.  Win2000 was OK, 2003 was what I'd consider to be their first solid server OS.   2008 was even better, same for 2012 except for that godawful win8 gui.
 I have Windows 2008 and 2012 servers that have been up for 18 months, no problems.

Are you one of those people who goes through life trying to make yourself feel better by criticizing others' choice of OS?
