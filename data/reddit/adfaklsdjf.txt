The trouble is that in cryptoes there are no fundamentals to analyze!  xD

He's not talking about fees depleting your account.  He's talking about the attacker needing the spread to be larger than the fees he will pay in order to make a profit.  Let's use an example with some fake numbers.
Suppose the exchange charges a trading fee of 1% of each transaction.  Per the attack you described, each time the attacker bleeds a little money from your account, he has to execute a buy transaction and then a sell transaction, so he will pay the fee twice.  
In the attack you described, each trade was executed within the price spread, i.e. below the lowest ask price and above the highest bid price.  
Suppose the asset in question is currently trading for around $100.  If the highest bidder is bidding $99.50 and the lowest seller is asking $100.50, that's only a $1, or about 1%.  If you buy for $99.50, you pay $0.95 (1%), and then you sell for $100.50, you pay another fee of $1.05.. you will have paid more in fees than you made buying "low" and selling "high".  
If the spread in the target asset was less than two trading fees, the attacker would lose money using the attack you described.

Native english speaker here, and I was wondering the same thing.
~~I checked a home improvement retailer's site for refrigerator brands and one was "Haier".. maybe that was the reference?~~
Oh I think I just figured it out.   "Colder".

No, no one said he did it at a loss.  No one suggested the thief was not making money.  No one suggested the attack you've described wouldn't work for him, or didn't work for him.  No one has questioned your understanding of the attack, whether it worked, how it worked, how much money he made off of you, or etc.
What was suggested is that he would only do it when it was profitable, and ***maybe*** the periods where he stopped doing it were when the spread wasn't working in his favor, so he waited.
The transactions you added to your post show him making a profit, because those are the ones where he (not stupidly, as you just said) took action because it worked out for him.
I'm sorry it's so frustrating for you when people are working to reach a common understanding of what's being said.
Edit to add:  And maybe that's not the reason he stopped during certain periods.  It was just an idea that was suggested about why he might have stopped the attack during certain periods of time, and a reason that makes a lot of sense.  I joined in because I thought I could help clarify what was and wasn't being said... but maybe not.

Unless there's a forced buy-out or the asset outright becomes defunct, although I suppose when the online brokerage won't display it to you anymore, you can still tell yourself "in my heart I still own that stock".  
Or so I've heard.....
