You seem to be afraid of "insurance" companies who would kill / cage / destitute you, if you decided to effectively resisted paying what they demand from you (which wasn't some service you requested to begin with).  Like, it would be real bad if something of the sort were to be imposed on you by them.
So.... you're terrified of the government then?
Can you answer that question? Thanks.
@_date: 2014-03-02 01:42:14
Not quite.
Statistkult adherents support stealing from, brutalizing and kidnapping people who don't share their beliefs and refuse to pay / obey the Church of Statism's demands. Bitcoiners do not support any of these aggressions against people who refuse to use Bitcoin.
That is the difference that makes statism into a religion and Bitcoin not a religion.

Governments don't give a shit about your pact, and your servile willingness to appease them with sacrifices and submit to their despotic orders, just shows you don't understand what they do.
Face it: Bitcoin will likely be banned by governments because governments can't have something that threatens their control of their subjects. Already many activities related to Bitcoin are banned, some even if you are a multimillionaire, and more bans are coming. It's just a matter of time.
What you can do: disobey.

 &gt;a tenet of modern finance asserts that anything electronic must be reversible.
Correct. Up to now, this was the dogma.  The existence and growth of Bitcoin proves that dogma wrong.


How can irreversibility be a "flaw" if, by his own admission, Bitcoin was designed to  "defy control of governments or banks" **and** irreversibility provides exactly that?
Seems to me like the feature he despises is working exactly as intended. In other words, it's not the *feature* he hates -- it's the fact that the feature *works* by protecting 
 users against bank and government control.
Conclusion: this article is simply statist FUD. He could have spared us all the thousand words and just said "I hate Bitcoin because it allows people to disobey Daddy Godvermint". But liars sow confusion with high-falutin' words.
Fortunately his FUD will backfire because he's telling his entire audience that there exists a way to hold money that cannot be frozen by bankers or stolen by government employees... and who the fuck would *want* that when one has a choice not to be vulnerable to that?

I'd be okay with that.  But, contrary to what you are saying here, I suspect you would not be okay with that, because you derive pleasure from me being robbed a little bit every day.
You like that, because your limited imagination doesn't allow you to deduce that organized robbery isn't the only way to pay for long stretches of tar and gravel.

I am sad that you only got to meet crazy people who identified as libertarians. How were they crazy? Did they threaten you with physical violence? Did they steal your stuff? Did they explode in random outbursts of aggression? Did they insist that there were things in front of them that weren't really there?
No? If that is the case, then they are not crazy. They just think different from you, and you are intolerant / bigot enough to call that "crazy". What's a good word to describe a person who calls perfectly sane people "crazy"?

We are not talking about what "is going to" be inflicted on Charlie (see OP). We are talking about what *ought* to happen to him.
So check your desire to burn a decent man who has done more good to his fellow people than you have probably ever done yourself. That goes doubly so, considering that your judgmentalism and aggressiveness against him is, at this time, based on zero facts and pure allegations, which you baselessly assume to be true. 
This isn't a sports game where you get to cheer for the bullies no matter what faults they commit. This is a human being's life you're advocating to be ruined. I hope you understand that. OK?
Now... You seem to not be tuned into the wavelength of us here discussing this drama show (again, we are not talking chitchat over what papers say, but rather whether the papers' contents are just), so I will respectfully withdraw until you explain yourself in Plain English of People Doing Things what we are talking here... including the distinction between "a bunch of gangsters kidnapped Charlie" and "it is just and righteous for the gangsters to kidnap Charlie".

So many mistakes in one comment.  Let's examine them.


This is not correct. The term "money laundering" can mean any one of tens of different acts. More importantly, *sometimes* the act involves obscuring the source of goods obtained through crimes, sometimes *not*.
You've made a mistake of fact -- in defining "money laundering", you've selectively ignored a large number of acts that are classified as "money laundering". That means your very first premise is false, thus your argument is probably going to be specious.


Okay, I take this to mean that what follows is a deduction (conclusion) based on the prior (false) claim.


Another mistake.
Now you've committed the common mistake of "some people who do X do it because they want to conceal Y... therefore every person who does X does it to conceal Y".
Making this mistake allows you to conclude (falsely) that Charlie aided thieves, when he has done no such thing.
This is a pretty basic logical task that you couldn't complete. I would be embarrassed if I was you. You should have thought a bit more before you wrote the above.
I mean, if you're gonna try and find a way to tell lies about Charlie, at least say something *credible*; instead, you say "money laundering is concealing the proceeds of crime, therefore Charlie aided thieves". Hahaha. A five year old can tell you that you're not even wrong.
Moving on:


You can't believe that I did something I did not do, and so you shouldn't.
You should also not lie. But given that you're committed to say the most ridiculously illogical things, I don't think a suggestion to behave ethically is going to persuade you. So I only say this to help you in your apparent mission to discredit yourself.

You say:


But then:


Revealing that your statement does not match your actions. You clearly prefer Bitcoin somewhat more over doge since you have more value in Bitcoin than you have in doge. It's like saying "I prefer hamburgers over pizza" then picking up a free pizza slice and eating it when free hamburgers are in front of you for the taking.
(Yes, when evaluating your statements, I am going to look at what you do as more important than what you say. That is the whole point of testing theories, sifting lies from truths, et cetera, you know the deal.)


Why would you do that, when that is the very worst time for your finances to do that change?
If you really prefer doge, and you think that doge will be more valuable than Bitcoin, you would exchange them right now, because that's the point in time when you will collect the most doge for your Bitcoin, instead of when one passes the other, at the point where you will get way less doge for your Bitcoin. Draw a declining line, a crossing ascending line, draw two axes, then do the math on the Y axis at several points in the X axis. Check it out for yourself.
(Unless you like to piss money away, in which case send your coins to someone who will appreciate them. That way you will have pissed your money away *and* helped someone else.)
I am not judging you, mate. All I know is that your comment makes anti-sense in multiple different ways.

Nice misleading statement! You reframe the issue by:
* misusing the word "freedom" in a way that doesn't mean "absence of coercion",
 * pretending that being against extortion is the same as "not contributing to society",
* asking a question that embeds the pretense,
* asking the question in the passive voice, to associate your imaginary position with me without actually accusing me of it.
Three forms of deceit in one sentence! Wow. It might have been a very effective smear in another circumstance.
Unfortunately, that trick doesn't work on me... and, judging from the votes, at least three other people saw right through it.
The reality is that no freedom advocate is against any of all those great things that you claimed... and you probably know it, which is why you needed do use deception to imply your smear rather than stating it (which would have been too obvious a smear).

This is ripe for implementing in a side chain.

That seems iffy to me.

This statement is about as true as "Spending your money without notifying God hurts the baby Jeezus".


Haha. I know so many people accused  of "laundering" what the laws themselves call "clean" money, this statement sounds like the rest of the Godvernment bullshit I am used to hear.
Just so you the reader knows, the accusation of "laundering money" has statutorily zero relationship with whether the money has been proven to be obtained from an illegal act... which itself may be just any other perfectly legitimate act.
Yes... Every day, anyone can (and some are) accused or convicted of "money laundering" simply by making deposits or exchanges of their own money, legitimately acquired, that just happened to take place without the accused snitching on themselves.
My interlocutor's intervention here is pro-capital controls propaganda with zero basis in reality or (if you care to believe in gospel) statute.  All he wants is for us to get punished and shamed for using mixing services.

You understand: self-sufficient poor people have nothing to lose but their lives, but the wealth of every rich person is completely hostage to any politician with a grudge and a pen to write "regulations" to "punish" these "greedy people"... or a district attorney with a chip on his shoulder and fabricated accusations.  Everything they have can be destroyed (stocks, companies), commandeered (remember that they only own shares of a corporation, which is a fiction created by Godvernment, who decides what happens to those fictions) or simply outright stolen ("eminent domain", "asset forfeiture").  That's in addition to the risk that the Servants of Holy Godvernment (in particular those under the Order of the ICE) [may just decide to plant child porn on all their computers, and blackmail / destroy them thereafter](
Look at poor the Holy Regulators disliked his biz, they destroyed it, and lately they've even threatened to ruin his life completely with a lawsuit.  That is how it looks when you get on the bad side of the Holy Cult of Godvernment and its corrupt benefactors.
This ex-Twitterer's paper wealth, everything he worked for, is entirely and literally tied to the people whose boots he licks, *and the presumption that they won't suddenly change the "rules" that give meaning to his paper wealth*... why wouldn't he cheer for further empowering them?

Sure, in your scenario, assuming the only thing that changes is that Bitcoin becomes the currency of choice for everyone, then Bitcoins stolen through mechanisms called "taxation" would still be used to bomb brown people's weddings and their kids. 
But what you're not considering is this simple fact: all the **borrowed money** that is essentially counterfeited with a "national debt" collateral would simply not be available.

Well, isn't that [what happened in Boston](  Actually, it is exactly what happened in Boston.  Just last year.  But even if there were no coordinated military effort like that one, wherever you live, there's still a large army of armed men prowling your neighborhood, prepared to ruin or take away your life, if you resist them.
Let's put things in perspective here.  If one is afraid of hypothetical aggression in a hypothetical stateless society, one should really be terrified shitless of aggression in all current societies, because State aggressors are everywhere, *do actually* in fact kill many innocent people, and the *only* reason *more* people aren't being executed by the State aggressors is because people meekly obey every order that the aggressors give to them (which pleases the aggressors enough to spare their victims' lives).
Think about it: do you stop when the blue and red lights flash behind you because it's an optional thing to do and you just like getting ticketed, or do you stop because you know that, if you don't, you gon be ded very soon?
Whether consciously or unconsciously, you know the answer to that question for yourself, and it is within the fear and guilt as the aggressor stops you to take your money and give you orders which you must obey.
So, now that we've discussed that, how is the current society you live in, any different from the scenario you present here?  It's really not different at all.  Perhaps what's fear-inducing about your scenario, is the fact that we actually already live in it.  If you're genuinely afraid of a hypothetical coercive scenario, then you should be even *more* afraid of the currently pervasive coercive scenarios, rather than fear some hypothetical society.
That is the single most important change of mind one can have, before abandoning the statist mindset.

Of course what you read won't convince you, because your beliefs about government are not rational but emotional in nature.
It's like someone told you as a child that you would be better off without alcoholic mommy -- no way in hell you'd accept that proposition.  Surely without mommy you would starve.
Now that you're a properly brainwashed and insecure adult, who was successfully and repeatedly told to place these alcoholics, drug abusers, murderers, fraudsters, thieves, brutes, arms traffickers and liars in the role of your parents / heroes / guardians, someone suggesting to you that they are evil would cause the same emotional reaction.  "No, how dare you suggest that I would survive my mommy being taken away!  I'll never believe that!". 
Government is your family... *only in your mind*, of course. One that doesn't beat you up too often, and only steals five months of your work every year. *But for them*, you are nothing but cattle, to be milked for your productivity, and punished (robbed, caged, murdered) if you rebel against them.  As long as you pay them, and obey them, they won't fuck you and your real family up.  But stop doing that... and you will quickly discover who they really are.  That's all there is.

From your own words, of course.
You can't support the extortion you call "taxes" without supporting (1) stealing up to everything a man has and may receive in the future, if he refuses to surrender to the extortion, (2) ordering him to go to a place, where he will be abusively accused of "wrongdoings" that he doesn't consider wrong to begin with, (3) kidnapping him, if he refuses to obey those orders to come, and (4) using as much violence as necessary (up to death) if he resists being kidnapped.
Do you deny this? Or are you just going to repeat what I said, but translated with righteous euphemisms that disguise the reality behind these acts? Or perhaps you will just slide into outright abuse, like any other bully does when he is confronted with a reality he hates?

You place orders via PGP, then the back end periodically initiates a connection to retrieve the orders from the frontend, and then checks whether they are properly signed by your key.

Depends on how they are implemented. You can implement a very slow AMD x86_64 (the instruction set is an AMD invention, not Intel) on an FPGA platform, and perhaps a couple of man-months. Total investment anywhere between 40 BTC to 200 BTC depending on the chip run size  This may be profitable depending on the target market.
If, however, you want to get faster processors, the investment grows substantially beyond that.
It may make business sense to do specialized processors like Analog Devices or Wolfson, or run ARM processors instead.  In the past there used to be a near monopoly on Intel architectures because Windows, but today (thanks to Linux, including Android) the count of ARM chips out there *dwarfs* the count of Intel chips.  Yes, in only a year's time. Amazing what competition can do.

Do some good for the world: post your name and address so people know to stay away from you.
I know you won't do that, because bottom-dwelling chickenshit scum can't afford to lose their predatory advantage of superficially making nice with others, while secretly wishing them wrong and wanting to ruin them for not sharing your malevolent ideas.
But hey, you've told us you're sociopathic already, so you don't get that advantage here anymore.

"lol" is exactly what your limited / poor person perspective would cause you to conclude.  The people who left?  They're not poor, and there's a lot at stake for them.  Would you leave seven figures on the table for the mobsters who rule you to steal?  I would not.
However, if I may add a little more clarity to why they have left: all of them agree that they are leaving not just for the money, but rather because the U.S. is rapidly descending into a downward spiral of authoritarianism.  The fact that they would see so much of their money stolen is merely a ramification of that death spiral.

The thing is, Charlie -- like many millions of peaceful people, rotting away in cages today -- *is* innocent in every sense that matters.
Consider "guilty" and "innocent" for a moment. These are two examples of how the legal system plays verbal sleight of hand on you and me.
Let's think about what Charlie did: Why would Charlie feel guilty for eating some brownies or helping someone buy coins? No sensible person would think either of these acts call for anyone feeling guilt...
...but then, the parasites from Legal Land swoop in to pervert the meaning of innocence and guilt with their own "technical" meanings, which are simply synonymous with "obedient" and "disobedient".
The truth about Charlie is that he did *nothing wrong*.  There are many considerations and contexts that would lead you and me to conclude certain acts are wrong, but *disobedience alone* is *not* an argument or a reason to call any act "wrong".
Legal Land is insane.  I make it a point not to allow my mind to be contaminated by that insanity.  That is why I avoid their language as much as I can.  Fortunately it's relatively easy to do that: I speak of things in plain English of people doing things.  And I invite others to join me in that effort.

What they *don't say* is the thing you must pay attention. They also *implicitly* determined that companies who do mining must know who their customers are.
If you run a rental farm of miners, and you can't explain who your customers are, they will fuck you up real fast. They will take your shit, your money, your business tools, everything... then they will accuse you of a number of fabrications which you will spend a fortune defending against... and then they will make you burn a fortune suing them to get them back.
Do you disagree that any of that is possible? No, I don't think you do. Which is why you will promptly snitch on your customers when they "ask" you who paid you for what... or, worse, simply not bother running a rental mining farm.

Other than the cultist ritual and the holy papers, I don't see any difference.  There is no magical exception in the definition that says "duress is so and so, but it's not duress if X and Y wear muumuus and write some papers prior to so and so".  This is all in your head.
Here is what is not in your head: If you refuse to be victimized in that cultist ritual, someone armed will come and drag your ass into a cage. If you resist them, he will beat you up or kill you.  Obviously, at each step of the whole process, you are threatened with all this violence, either implicitly (or written, explicitly).
Why are you in denial about this?  Do you really think that I would accept something as dumb as "no, in this case duress isn't duress, because reasons" as an argument?   Haha, obviously not.  When you obey these people, you obey them knowing full well that *you are under duress*.
Hence, duress.  You have failed to refute what I said.

Not at all.  ARPANET and the Internet are completely different things.  ARPANET had SMTP, UUCP, and other completely obsolete shit.  The Internet as you know it has *nothing to do* with ARPANET.


I am sure statists feel that way about Bitcoin, just as the Pope's recognition of the "legitimacy" of non-Latin religious services was also hailed as "revolutionary" for Roman Catholics.  Wow, look at the nice Pope, *graciously allowing* us plebes to attend mass *and* understand what's being said, such revolution, so Godly.
But I don't believe in religious crap, so I don't really care or share that belief.

First of all, no. The way this is going will mean that exchanges will become very few and controlled only by people who are multimillionaires and in bed with the "regulators".  Second, people can't just choose to use an exchange in a foreign place because there are enormous costs associated with that decision.
Regulation is killing Bitcoin in the white market. At the rate these malevolent Godvernment attempts at controlling Bitcoin, all of us will be declared criminals in less than two years.

They usually aren't, since the victims of the scheme are being defrauded by not informing them of what the deal is. Thus the requirement for *informed* consent is not met. Therefore, not voluntary.
HOWEVER, there HAVE been documented cases of schemes where the creator of the scheme publicly explains it is indeed a Ponzi (I believe it was a Russian guy who did that). Participants in those schemes are definitely voluntarily participating since they know full well about how the schemes work. A fool and his money are soon parted and all that stuff.

The link above is the Cyphernomicon, a compilation of cypherpunk ideas that directly originated the very notion of cryptocurrency, Chaumian cash, and Bitcoin itself. You are encouraged to read it so you learn exactly what fundamental ideas and pioneering people you're supporting when you use, patronize, buy and pay with Bitcoin.
Bitcoin was invented explicitly and precisely to prevent third parties from deauthorizing, intervening, and sabotaging transactions between two parties -- [the very thing that sank the previous iteration of cryptocurrency (Chaumian cash)]( This is not my opinion, but Satoshi's desires, expressed in many ways by him, and the facts of the protocol. All of Wei Dai, David Chaum, Half Finney and other important crypto people agree with that cypherpunk vision.
So, if you think that Bitcoin will usher an era of even greater financial control by people you revere... you are making a mistake. Bitcoin serves to advance the cause of the cypherpunks, not your own.

Generosity is not an unpopular opinion, and you will find many people who support you.
Sadly, confusing organized extortion with generosity (on of the memes of the cult of Godvernment) is also not unpopular. The whole "pay your fair share" is normally a verbal expression of this meme.


Good; you seem to be a great and generous person.
I encourage you to give it to a charity (or start your own!) instead of giving it to people who bomb brown people weddings, murder mentally disabled people, and create exceptions for very rich people. E.g. if you care about education, maybe give directly to schools that are decent. I give money monthly to education projects myself.
How much you give is just as important as who gets to spend it.

Exactly. Professor just described the definition of *extrinsic* value, then proceeded to call that "intrinsic" value.
I have a theory of why people do this.  It's just that people have this obsession with "intrinsic" value, because of the popular beliefs "intrinsic value is best value" and "if the value is intrinsic, then its price isn't at risk of dropping". 
People want these beliefs to be true, such that they can rationalize their investments by ascribing this magical " intrinsic value" property to their favorite asset, so they can reassure themselves with " See? I bought into something really truly valuable, I am safe, pinky swear, hi five!"
I mean, shit, man, there are people out there who believe in their own immortal souls, because they don't want to contemplate the finite quality of their lives. Why wouldn't there be people who believe in the "immortal soul" of things they bought, to avoid facing the possibility that these things could become 100% worthless?

Your sentence is a common but misleading use of the word "price".
If someone will ruin your life for not giving up some amount of money, then the amount is not a "price" to begin with, because "price" implies there is an offer you can take or leave with no aggression should you choose not to take it.
In that case, since aggression (up to and including murdering you if you resist) is used to *force* you to pay, it is called a *loot*, because the aggression makes the act an *extortion*.

*Nominally,* of course.  If today you were paying $450 for a Bitcoin, and next week you would be paying $45.000 for the same Bitcoin, and the fee is 1% (it is), then today you'd pay $4.5 in fees and next week you'd pay $450 in fees.
Obviously if you see something like this unfold in your daily life, what happens is that you'd just buy 1/100th of a Bitcoin instead, keeping the fees *the same*.  So I don't see how your hypothesis about the *fees* would affect demand for Bitcoin.
I think there are *dramatically more important* reasons why Bitcoin demand may go down -- for example, *people would need to spend fortunes on food*, which means they are forced to save way less by buying Bitcoin.

Elementary tenets that, appallingly, most people haven't even heard of, much less can't they even understand.
You're completely correct.
@_date: 2014-02-02 17:17:31


First of all, you still need at least one file server with BitTorrent.
Second, file servers are cheap -- you are using one right now.
Third, the server is almost never the bottleneck since any $250 computer can push a sustained 1Gb bandwidth.
Fourth, BitTorrent is reliable not because of its P2P characteristic but because of cryptographic checksums. Rsync, a non P2P protocol, is just as reliable and far more efficient in terms of bandwidth and computing resources.
Fifth, services like Usenet are actually much faster to deliver files. The pros don't bother with BitTorrent. They all use Usenet. Things always appear first in Usenet too.
The *only* reason BitTorrent is "cheap" is because, when you use torrents to distribute files and save yourself the bandwidth costs, you are *making your customers pay* for your infrastructure with their computation power and bandwidth, like a cheap ass. Someone *always* pays. The net cost of BitTorrent is *always* more expensive in terms of needed resources than normal TCP file transfer.


That's outright false.
The reason BitTorrent was invented is to evade stupid laws.
We know this not just because it was invented and adopted  *after* they started punishing file sharing seriously, not before.
We also know this because we see a progression of legal sabotage against users and purveyors of shared files that goes like this: sabotage starting from centralized search and file server (FTP) to centralized search and decentralized file server (Scour, Napster), and then decentralized search and file serves (BitTorrent).
We also know this because, contrary to what you claim, the use of BitTorrent for file synchronization and game distribution is extremely recent, compared to the use that prompted its invention: decentralized sharing of files that would otherwise land you in prison.
@_date: 2014-04-14 23:35:37

@_date: 2014-02-05 02:17:29






I'm sorry to butt in, but this sentence you wrote irritates me.  Allow me explain why it irritates me.
My friend Throwahoymatie said two different things, both of which are undeniably and observably true.  In response, you write something that sounds to me like an insinuation that my friend is "a bit out there" (I understand that to mean slightly crazy according to its most popular use).
I re-read what you wrote, and I ask myself: what is crazy about stating facts (whether leading to a conclusion or not)?  Crazy people state *untruths* and behave according to *untruths*.  That's the essential feature that *distinguishes* a *crazy* person from a *sane* person.
A person who believes he can fly with his arms is called *crazy* because (1) the belief "a man can fly with his arms" is *demonstrably false*, yet (2) he insists on believing it and behaving as if the belief was true (e.g. batting his arms while jumping off a high-rise).
But your sentence seems to me that it implies *the exact opposite* -- that stating facts makes him "slightly out there".  Why?  If anything, the statements that my friend Throwahoymatie made are *certifiably sane*, because they are *correct*, and you can *personally* verify them.
If you're telling someone that "people think you're slightly crazy because you talk about all these things that are true"... don't you think that's *at least a little insulting*?  I perceive it as insulting to my friend.  He's more gracious than me and has decided to continue talking to you, but I can see how anyone else would simply feel insulted and then stop interacting with you positively.
Do you object to his claims?  If you do, what exactly is it that you object to?  The *truthfulness* of his claims?  Or the fact that he *said* them?  In either case, using "people think" to possibly indirectly accuse him of being "slightly out there"... doesn't actually tell us what you object to, or do nothing in terms of bringing clarity to the conversation.

You clearly have **no idea** what the law says.  Pretty much anything can land you into "money laundering" charges -- from a large withdrawal of your bank account, to several consecutive small deposits.  Even **mere inaction** can get your life ruined.
There are **countless perfectly legitimate and ethical activities** that legally fall under the "money laundering" made up crime.  People have been entrapped by stranger assholes merely because the strangers deliberately deposited money in the victims' accounts.  This recently happened to the owner of a small startup working on privacy software, and it got so bad they decided to leave the U.S..  It was posted on this very subreddit.
So no, it's not just "criminals and anarchists" who want these terrible life-ruining commandments to be abandoned.  It's actually lots of decent people, especially those who have been ruined by them, but also those of us who actually can experience sympathy and aren't sociopathic fucks who don't give a shit when decent people are hurt.

Actually, the example you mention proves my point, my man. BitTorrent is technically a subpar solution to distributing files compared to many other protocols.  BitTorrent developers deliberately traded efficiency, manageability and computation cost in exchange for privacy and resilience, so that they and their users could escape the cage.
In general, decentralized systems (the kind of systems usually engineered to escape the threats of being caged, or to withstand large scale failures and sabotages) are *always harder* to implement and more error prone, yielding fewer features and benefits for equal programmer time.  I would know -- I help manage the base bits for the only planetary-level supercomputer in existence.

Not entirely true.  First, the basics: A Bitcoin ban leaves Bitcoin's uses completely untouched -- it is Bitcoin's **users** that would be *harmed and hurt*.
I'm also pretty sure that a ban would cause *some* of those "simpletons" to abandon Bitcoin, but *lots* of people (millions and millions, to be more exact) would *continue* to use Bitcoin.  They would just do it *secretly*... exactly like buying and selling drugs happens under the table today.
This leads me to believe that the evildoers d.b.a. "government" won't actually ban Bitcoin, because they understand instinctively that banning it is just a recipe for sending Bitcoin underground, and they also know they don't (yet) have the public relations clout to explain away such a prohibition as "virtuous" and "necessary" (which they **always** need to do before they prohibit any act, or object, or person).

What the morons in this thread don't realize is that this new holy paper paves the way to impose all kinds of new legal punishments on people who use Bitcoin in many ways that were not previously punishable before according to the old papers. Yes, it will become "illegal" (in statist parlance) to do all kinds of things... unless you're part of the Old Boys Club. And ***you*** are not even fucking close to be there.

This is a valid criticism -- it's perfectly understood that decentralized peer-to-peer systems tend to be less performant and more complex than equivalent centralized systems -- but that's the **tradeoff** for increased security and resilience against censorship and sabotage.
The creator of Bitcoin chose this tradeoff, and users of Bitcoin support the tradeoff, because they consider it reasonable.  Those who don't, can always use dollars or other paper moneys.


Depends on *what kind* of authority.  The voluntarily-granted authority of a surgeon to operate on his patient is certainly good.  The unilaterally-imposed authority to ruin someone's life and steal everything he has, if he disobeys orders made up by strangers, is certainly malevolent.

Witness the gilded bankers who "disobeyed" hundreds of holy paper prohibitions when they helped disguise the unholy proceeds of allegedly terroristic "drug trade". Witness all of them walking free while the Holy Law says they ought to be caged... yet somehow the Holy Priests in Charge of Inflicting Tha Law don't do shit.
Reality has FUCK ALL to do with this Legal Land delusion.  The faster you adapt to this undeniable reality, the better off you will be.

I agree with you that Bitcoin brought cryptocurrencies to the "clueless" (as defined by the cyphernomicon) masses, which had the unfortunate consequence of inaugurating the Eternal September of staazis in this sub.
I agree that they have no idea what exactly is it that they patronize when they rub their little grubby hands over their stashes, much less any idea of what a principle even is (besides obedience and subservience).
I feel it's only fair that they should know. If the greedy staazis are shocked to know that they are in fact empowering those pesky cryptoanarchists and cypherpunks... that's for them to deal with.

Oh, nonono. You are not roping me and my phone keyboard into this. Burden of proof: *it's not my obligation* to argue *against* your claims *before* you have argued *for* them.
Let's look at the succession of events here. You first made a questionable claim ("silver possesses intrinsic value").  Then *you never supported it*.
Burden of proof rule means I don't have to do diddly squat to refute it. Nor could I even if I wanted to, because there is no argument of yours to refute.
And no, your latest response does not prove your claim *in the slightest*. And speculatively calling me "an arrogant libertarian" just makes your whole position even weaker -- if you had arguments, you would not need to call people names.
So how about you actually *substantiate your claims* instead of behaving like an impostor philosopher and verbal abuser?

I want you to think about what you just asked me a bit longer.  Look at the levels of spending burnt in mass murdering brown people, then compare them to the levels of borrowing by the same organization.  Do you think that could continue **solely** by them borrowing all the existing amount of money?
The answer is that it can't.  It would quickly come to a halt.  The only way that mass murder can continue is by systematic borrowing of money that doesn't exist.  That is (oversimplified) the Treasury says "we need a trillion dollars" to the Fed.  The Fed says "Sure, no problem".  The Treasury emits 1 trillion worth of bonds to the Fed, the Fed gives 1 trillion dollars in exchange.  The Fed can do whatever they want with those bonds (usually, they sell them).
Can you do that with Bitcoin?  No, you can't, because it would quickly become obvious that the people emitting the bonds can't repay them with Bitcoin they don't have.  They can't print trick Bitcoins to pay the interest, for Christ's sake.  This fraud is something that can only be perpetrated when people don't have their money, but rather their money belongs to institutions that would cooperate with the fraudsters. *Banks*.
**I want you to understand one paramount thing about Bitcoin: the reality about Bitcoin above is the first fundamental innovation of Bitcoin (the second reality is that Bitcoin has a practical solution to the Byzantine Generals Problem).  A gang of thugs decreeing that everyone in their domain will be using Bitcoin** ***cannot*** **counterfeit money with the tricks and misdirections used contemporarily.  They cannot wage war limitlessly, and then postpone the soft default for later by printing more money, Weimar or Zimbabwe style.**  This is **the whole point** of Bitcoin, this is why Bitcoin is **better** than any other currency, mint, token, or any form of stored value.  This is why the 21 million limit is  so sacred.
Does this make sense?

If investment is generally desirable, then there's no need to herd people like cattle into investment -- people will desire invest as they see fit, seeking their own balance between liquidity and investment return which they feel safe with.  That is what *generally desirable* means.
The fact that people must be artificially forced to be more illiquid than they would normally choose to be, through surreptitious systematic robbery of the value of their money, tells me that the whole "y'all need to invest" is sanctimonious self-serving Wall Street bullshit.

He is correct that there is no commodity backing Bitcoin.
But that does not give him license to treat you like a moron. Why? Because, if using a currency that is unbacked makes someone a moron, then he is a moron too.
Think about it: he uses colored rectangles of paper, whose value can be (and is daily) sabotaged by strangers he does not know, that has zero standing promise to redeem for any commodity (IOW, "lack of backing", which is the excuse he gives to distrust Bitcoin).
In other words, his own currency of choice is 100% unbacked by anything, and has been so for almost a century now, and loses value daily.
And he has the gall to laugh at you?  What a clueless hypocrite he is.  It should be you who looks at him like a moron.
@_date: 2014-01-30 01:42:26




Similar story here. They were pooh-poohing the currency and I said "well I bought some", then they condescended me for having lost money in the correction.
Then I said "yeah that sucks but I still have enough to never work again" with a shit eating grin on my face...
...You should have seen their faces man,  LOL. Delightful!
Then one of them said kinda apologetically "well, I wish you will with your good fortune" and then they all went away. Conversation ended.
I am sure they are not bad people, and I believe it when they wish me well. But they were shocked that one of them would indulge in this "deflationary fiat currency doomed to fail", and even more shocked to know that it gave me a way out of the rat race.

You know who does *not* do it?  A person who is both right and honest.  He doesn't need or want to engage in verbal manipulation of that sort... because he has the facts and he has the principles to prove himself correct.  Only a person who is both *wrong and dishonest* needs to *stoop to calling other people names* to get his way.
So when bollekegekapt says:


...irony itself just rolls its eyes, because it is *him* constantly turning decent conversations with potential, into "black and white fights" where he deliberately hurls angry personal attacks to feel like he "won"... when in reality all he did was show to the world how *wrong* he is and how *dishonest* he can get to get his way.
bollekegekapt and many other statists who behave like him are *not right*, and they are *not honest*.  What they are, is **bullies** full of **hate**.

That will happen when the doge users get to experience inflation in the flesh.
When that happens, most of them will go "huh? why have prices risen so much?". Then they will learn *why* Bitcoin was engineered with deflation. They will then switch.

This is a pseudo moral theory. I will dismantle it now.
The theory goes something like this (if I understood this correctly):


First of all: this is a mishmash of moral and economic theories. Morals are prescriptive, economics is descriptive.  You just raped the is ought dichotomy. Congratulations on losing all credibility.
Second: *you don't know* that Bitcoin will lead to concentrations of wealth. So all you're doing here is quite literally making shit up. Congratulations, again.
Third: your theory is both unfalsifiable and unprovable. If the world adopts Bitcoin and concentrations of wealth happen, that doesn't prove Bitcoin was the cause. If the world adopts yet another type of inflationary junk, and concentrations of wealth vanish, that doesn't prove your theory right (as there are concentrations of wealth already with near full adoption of inflationary junk). 
That alone disqualifies it from even being called "theory" (which I will start complying with right about... now). Bravo, that's three mistakes in a single idea unit.
Fourth: you imply in your tea leaves dream that inequality will take place with adoption of a deflationary currency. *But you don't actually explain how*. Since you took that sleaze license, I will advance my own baseless tea leaves reading: it is perfectly possible that Bitcoin will usher a world where *everybody*'s grandpa owned railroads and important businesses. That would, of course, be great for everyone. We haven't ever seen what happens when a deflationary currency is adopted by the majority. So a world where kids show each other pictures of their wealthy grandparents, and nobody is poor anymore, is still in the cards. Thus, your weasely presage that Bitcoin leads to inequality is dismantled.
Finally, even if everything you've claimed is right and comes to pass, *so what?* Here be you, insisting you have the opportunity to be the pioneer who reaps the rewards of being early to Bitcoin. If you truly believe that this "only early adopters will be filthy rich" doomsday scenario will happen, why would you be *so utterly stupid and irresponsible with your descendants as to not reap those rewards today?*
Ah. Because you don't know what you're talking about. That is why you say much, yet make little sense.
It's clear you have not thought a single one of your economic dogmas through. Enjoy your doge.

The reason you don't want to talk about the topic is because you, as a statist, detest and abhor having your identity beliefs questioned.  But you won't ever admit to that, because that means you and your beliefs lose face.
Thus, you call my friend names ("uninteresting"), and then cowardly eject from the conversation, right when your beliefs get questioned.  Your behavior is the standard statist behavior, by the way, so don't think you're special in that regard -- you're not.

It is very simple.
You pay the price for the long shares (green), or whatever price you choose (in which case someone may eventually take you up on your share price, see market depth tab there) and then if you win they pay you $10mBTC per share. If you lose they pay you nothing.
For the short shares (red) everything is the same except that you pay the *complement* of the price listed there (e.g. if it says 9.00 in the red button you buy one share at 1.00 mBTC). And of course you win and get paid if the event resolves in the negative.
You can sell any shares you own at any time you want, either for a profit or to take a smaller loss.

Here's what's worst: I actually *agree* with you, but not for the reasons you stated. Bitcoin cannot be regulated because "regulation" is simply threats inflicted on *humans*. You can't terrorize a Bitcoin, but you *can* terrorize a man with ruin, to get him to obey, and in some cases, into thinking that your terrorism is virtuous justice.
In fact, it's trivial to do so: you are threatened daily with literally millions of punishments conditionalized on you doing or refraining from doing certain things, most of which are perfectly fine, ethical and virtuous. You just don't realize it because it becomes *unthinkable* to behave in ways that will get you ruined, caged, or shot by the "regulators".
So, for example: just as it is presently unthinkable for you to conceive of humans being terrorized if they post a "Bitcoin accepted here" sticker on their checkout counter, *once the "regulators" decide to go ahead with that plan*, shortly thereafter it will become *unthinkable* to even consider putting that cute sticker up, especially for the coming generations of people who never knew a time when that act wasn't punishable. And all the people around you would instantly think of you as a terrible person deserving of punishment, if you decided to disobey and put that sticker up.
Same with the idea of punishing anyone who has a miner rig but no permission to own one. At the moment, the "regulators" have decided not to demand that you ask them for permission... but this could change anytime, and then what was formerly perfectly normal (running your rig) suddenly becomes unthinkable unless, of course, you get your "BitLicense", which "everybody knows it's necessary to protect the Bitcoin financial system".
There is literally no limit to the atrocious ideas that the saboteurs you call "regulators" can impose on you by force. Heck, this place is *teeming* with masochists and control freaks who actually *want* these types of threats to be realized in the Bitcoin space, reasoning (incorrectly) that once the threats are in place, Bitcoin will become "legitimate" (demonstrating their complete misunderstanding of what legitimacy even is). If you think that you won't be threatened for using Bitcoin in certain ways, you are already wrong -- you already can't run an "unpermitted" exchange without risking ruin and kidnappings from the "regulators".
And, save for complete revolt, there is nothing they could dictate that would cause people to openly disobey. Nobody likes to sit in a cage with rapists.

Bitcoin will *never* go mainstream, until mainstream has been redefined to mean:

2. No people can steal your shit by writing stuff on papers to authorize themselves to steal your shit if you disobey the papers.
3. No people can arbitrarily print money, destroying the value of your savings in the process, and borrowing money in your and your children's behalf.
When that chasm is crossed, Bitcoin will have gone mainstream... but only because the mainstream went Bitcoin (or some equivalent), not the other way around.
Politics  is a technology problem, and Bitcoin is here to solve it.  Not by making it automatic, but by making it irrelevant.  What you do with it, it's entirely up to you.  Just keep in mind that every payment you make with untraceable coins, you are voting for your own self-determination, and against politics determining your life.

Yet you're criticizing the video for having obvious anarchist elements in it?
Can you really expect your criticism to be taken seriously?


That is because Bitcoin itself is an anti-political statement. Yes, it is. No, your denial doesn't change reality.
Why do you think so many anarchists use Bitcoin?  Do you think it's a coincidence?


Already was.  Sorry you couldn't deduce it.


"Decentralized currency" **is a political thing**. If you use Bitcoin, *you are making the political statement* "I have begun rejecting the sociopolitical system of *centralized currency*".  Just like there is no divorcing the water from the wetness, there is no divorcing the money from the political system which created it.


Save them.   So, if you don't want to make a political statement, stick to obeying your masters and pay with the notes they print for you.

Quick history lesson: everything necessary for internetworking was *already invented* when the mobsters you worship decided to apply the concepts to building a network (ARPANET), not for people to share photos of cats and buy things with ease, but rather to resiliently coordinate how to mass murder people.  Y'know, to keep the network up, in case the people they decide to murder fight back.
Also, let's not forget how the Internet is actually a completely different thing from what ARPANET used to be, and it is what it is today, not because of Magical Godvernment Commandments, but because of the hard work of all the millions of people who *don't* join that mafia.

Aha. So now there are "new rules" for renting mining rigs. Of course, the implication of those rules is that nobody under those rules will be able to keep their activities anonymous... unless they want to risk their lives and their families' being ruined.
In other words: like I predicted, they are slowly beginning to turn Bitcoin into a tiny PayPal, by sabotaging all the properties that made Bitcoin unique.
First it was "regulations" to exclude 99% of the people from selling coins. Then, it was "tax guidance" to sabotage the lives of people who buy stuff with Bitcoin. Now, they're going to undermine the miners' anonymity as well.
And most of you cheered for that.
Yet here you all are, wondering why oh why the price has stagnated at 444.  *This is why, you blind and dumb statist fucks*.  Your stupid regulations have sabotaged individuals freely buying, accepting, and selling Bitcoin, and now mining is next. But no, of course.  You're all too busy bickering about totalitarian China and jacking off to the new impositions you're being ordered to obey, while totalitarianism is preventing you from doing all these fascinating things you *could* do with your own money, all happening right in front of your fucking faces.

You're about five years too late in noticing that the technology itself is highly political.
@_date: 2014-02-03 07:43:27




On *every* issue that specifically a currency could possibly be political, yes. See:
* Who ultimately controls one's own balances and can bar access to anyone else? The users, not the rulers.
* Who controls the issuance and limits? The users, not the rulers.
* Who can stop a transfer from happening? Only the owner, not the rulers.
* Is it forever inflationary like rulers would like? No.
* Who controls what identity is associated with which transaction? The users, not the rulers.
That's just four ways in which Bitcoin pisses on standard statist political assumptions, all of which earned Bitcoin much hate and contempt from so many politicos. There are more.
So how can Bitcoin ever be an politically neutral thing with so many political choices embedded in it? 
It can't.


Satoshi's agenda is political, as he has revealed so himself. If anyone wants a different agenda, he is free to start his own cryptocurrency with his own parameters, or just use the rectangles of paper his rulers graciously give hem.

Quick observation: "Scarcity" isn't a form of backing. "X is backed by Y" means "X can be exchanged for this other thing" because there is a standing promise from someone to give you Y in exchange for your X.
For example: dollar bills of yore were backed by gold. Another example: checks are usually backed by deposits in a bank. OTOH, gold itself was and is backed by nothing, and modern bank notes aren't backed by anything either.
With this said, in popular belief, people confuse backing and value.  In reality, contrary to popular belief, backing and value are separate concepts.
Again, an example: gold being unbacked does not imply at all that gold has no value.  Since the value of every item in the world is simply how much people want that item, and we know that people wanted (and some still do want) gold (each with their own reasons why),  even as gold is unbacked, it has value (for those who want gold, of course).
TLDR: scarcity gives gold value for some people, but does not give it backing.

Yes and no. Almost everything in this BIP is quite literally truthful.  Only the two sarcastic statements (Satoshi's. C++ mastery and the PHP fib) betray the BIP as April 1st material.
Particularly, the code as implemented today *will do* what the BIP says it will do. The reward will fold back to 50 BTC per block.  Yes, the code as written has this behavior. It's just that this clusterfuck will happen around every two hundred years or so.
In other words, we have been quite literally mistaken all along -- Bitcoin isn't actually a finite supply currency pegged at 21M base units.  That the author of the BIP decided to refer to this phenomenon as "Satoshi modeling the discovery of four mines every mibilenium" *which is a valid inference based on the code* is an absolute stroke of genius.

That is why storing lots of Bitcoin in your phone is so fucking dangerous, and that is why serious companies always disallow such devices in their secure networks.

Charlie is not guilty of anything.
He is being accused of having done a number of things that are prohibited according to some papers.  Perhaps he indeed did those things.  The legal terminology describing the coincidence between the facts and the charges would be "guilty".
This is a deliberate brainwashing trick played on you, to make you assume that having done something which you are found "guilty" (in the legal sense) of, necessarily implies that you are guilty (in the common sense) of having done something wrong.  Nothing could be further from the truth.
The legal field is full of these manipulative tricks.  The entirety of the legal profession has words that have been redefined in manners completely incompatible wiht the common sense of those words.  Hiding behind these redefined terms is a large part of the reason all these violent parasites d.b.a. "government" routinely get away with so much scummy and corrupt behavior.

You can write a solid backend in Python... it just won't be very performant because Python is slow and memory-hungry; and you can't make it very complex either, because the language doesn't defensively protect you against bugs.

And you think that drugs are a talisman of evil that make people do shitty things to you?
No wonder your lolsome conclusions.


The "social cost of drugs" is a social cost of the prohibition.  No drunks or smokers broke in to your car, did they?
Didn't think so.


So you're in favor of not punishing people for drugs, but since they are being punished now, then what? What is your point exactly?
Are you suggesting that because things are a certain way, that's right and that's how they ought to be, and that makes it okay for things continuing that way?
Are you suggesting that because certain holy papers say "X horrific things must be done to those who own / trade drugs", that such a Commandment is holy, righteous, and must be obeyed at all costs?
Negroes two hundred years ago would have had a beef with you, and so would Juden just eighty years ago.


Not *to you*, obviously.
To me, so long as they don't resort to aggression, they are, because they are *acting as if they were free from punishment for their peaceful actions.*


I do. Maybe your mind is clouded by magical parchments and holy Commandments, but I do whatever the fuck pleases me, so long as it's ethical and I won't get caught.

Blindness can be mental (wilful) or biological. Since I can see the sidebar and you can see my writing, I will assume your blindness is merely mental, and assume that any references to Satoshi's writings you will also deny.
So you won't get those references from me -- especially not the juicy juicy googleable and signed reference where he says his invention Bitcoin will advance the cause of freedom for many years (which he was right about). Ask someone else so you can then deny them.


"It's clear" is a weasel expression designed to make your statement sound credible without actually presenting any references (which somehow you hypocritically and vehemently demand before you consider ideas you hate).
Your statement contains a specific lie which is easily disproven. How? Well, back on Planet Earth (and away from planet Denialia) in our observable reality, Satoshi is more of an expert than you (and quite many other people) in macroeconomics *because he single handedly created a successful hypermonetizing macroeconomy*.
That qualifies *him* to speaks on the matter, and disqualifies *your* denialist opinions.


**Yes there is**. He was **right**. His ideas weigh **because** reality endorses his ideas.  Scientific method and all that.


Build it and prove your theory, *then* we'll talk. Satoshi did it, why can't you?
All in all, I see a bunch of tenuous denialism of Satoshi's ideas on your part, peppered by weasel words and belittlement of a **great** accomplishment which you cannot cover up. Your credibility after this behavior of yours is very questionable. The stuff you say you "never heard"? Like I said, you are deaf only because you want to.

Yes, of course, people sell BTC for altcoins, all transactions are two-sided.  The point is that those people selling BTC for altcoins end up losing value, because the overall trend is to mine altcoins, then ditch them to buy BTC, which drives the price of BTC higher, not lower.

I can see how you would fabricate that in an attempt to frame me as "emotional" (along with all its unspoken negative connotations).  Belittlement is another form of abuse.
You've tried four different emotional bullying tactics to provoke me, but none of them have worked.  That probably irritates you and makes you feel impotent, which is why you continue to try and provoke me.  You probably feel that, if you could achieve one small "victory" by provoking me, your efforts would be vindicated and you'd go back to feeling normal instead of impotent.  You're probably sitting there, thinking real hard to try summoning that perfect witty passive aggressive abusive quip that will make you "come out on top" of what you see not as a peaceful exchange of ideas, but as a "battle" which you must dominate (but you feel you have sorely lost).  Walking away is not an option for you.
You know, petty inferiority complex statist stuff.  I don't know for certain, but that's what it looks like.  I've seen it all.  It's boring.  The fact that I know this allows me to *control* you, to keep you *roped in*.  There's a couple of things I *could* say to keep you there, fuming, angry, impotent.  *I choose not to*.
I'd ask you how many times you were belittled before you adopted that abusive strategy yourself, but you probably wouldn't tell me... and I don't quite care enough to know anyway.

Does it matter?
I personally can't show you any evidence that they have used this tech, but plenty security experts can muster that evidence (see the latest 30c3 videos).
More importantly, I do not need the evidence that they are raping my digital life, in order for me to adapt my behavior and technology to protect myself. The fact that they *can* do so is enough.
In other words: If tomorrow I obtained hard evidence that they had been raping my life in the past, it would not change anything for me, because I already live under the assumption that they do so, and take the appropriate security measures. They can, after all, murder me and get away with it, or key in a seven-figure debt in my bank accounts, so in the grand scheme of things, raping my digital life is comparatively minor unless the data they steal leads them to ruining me or someone else.  I have done the security and risk analysis.
And make no mistake: keeping people obedient and fearful is ultimately what they want. The ultimate reason they collect all the info and hack all the devices, *is so that they can catch people who covertly disobey them, and then ruin their lives or murder them.* That is, in Plain English of People Doing Things, what these malevolent control freaks want, and they want that because they are malevolent control freaks.
Act accordingly.

I used to get a lot of hate when I would reply to comments with facts disproving my interlocutor's claims. So much hate, anger, abuse.
I abandoned that method, because it is uniquely ineffective to confront people with the facts that prove their feELS wrong. Doesn't work. Best way to address an emotional issue is completely divorced from facts, because the issue was initially and irredeemably divorced from facts to begin with.
So now I go Socrates.
Now I get **more** of that, because I simply ask them to prove what they are saying, and translate their euphemisms into Plain English of People Doing Things :-)

"Sorry but this is a stupid idea. Lashing slaves is not akin to assault. Some lashes are very often necessary."
"Regulation" isn't "akin to" terrorism. It is **exactly literally** terrorism. The translation of "regulation" from Orwellian Paternalist Propaganda to Plain English is: the use of **terror** (the terror of being kidnapped, the terror of being ruined, the terror of being brutalized, the terror of one's own name being defamed) to get people to **obey** and **surrender** to **political demands**.
So let's compare reality with this indisputable definition of terrorism that has no magical exceptions. Did the "regulators" terrorize Charlie? Yes, Charlie was kidnapped, and is most certainly currently in fear for his well-being, and possibly his bodily integrity. Did they do so to get Charlie to obey? Yes, and if Charlie had resisted they would have assaulted or even murdered Charlie. Did this aggression have anything to do with political demands? Yes, the orders to do this to Charlie ultimately come exactly from politicians.
Terrorism. This is **exactly** what they have done to Charlie Shrem here, and nothing you say alters that reality -- especially not stupid shit like calling terrorism by an inoffensive-sounding name, or pretending that terrorism is "very much necessary" -- because what we observe the thugs do with our own eyes, is never altered by the words we say.

Too bad OP's sarcasm is hollow and has zero basis, since it was ultimately **voluntary cooperation** (the very concept he is mocking) that actually reduced the hash power of GHASH.io. And, of course, we are not Randians to begin with, so all that "captains of industry" and "rising to the top" catchphrases simply do not represent us.
Leave it to the statists to make sarcastic remarks (with implied support for threats against miners a.k.a. "regulation"). Statists gonna state. Meanwhile, us voluntaryists (the first adopters of Bitcoin) will be busy shaping the world without aggression. The statist who says "voluntary cooperation can't be done" ought to move out of the way of the voluntaryists who are doing it.

Keep backups of the password instead.  It's easy to do with SSSS.  Create a long copypastable password.  M of N it using SSSS.  Hand each N shard stored in a USB stick to people who you can trust.
Or have a 3 of 4. Have your designated probate officer or will executor get 2. Give the other 2 to a friend who doesn't normally ride the same bus or car you do.  The probate should have instructions to contact him and also instructions to decrypt the wallet with the 2 pieces he has and the 2 pieces your friend has.

There is a **reason** the criminals who ordered Charlie kidnapped published a **press release** about what they did.  And the reason is **to make him look bad, to assassinate his character, to set public opinion up against Charlie**, and, of course, **to advertise how malevolent they are, generating terror in us**.  It's not at all an accident that they do so, and it's not at all an accident that **only their organization publishes press releases of the people they kidnap**.

And this is not a battle you can win because they have all the guns.

I like auto pay. I would not use an Uber-like service that required me to pay upfront or after every ride. Uber is a great service as it is, with post-facto collection of fees from my credit card.  One of the great reasons for me to use Uber is that I can get in the car and get out of the car without having to go thru the payment stage, and the associated waits.
But I may be persuaded otherwise, if the service managed to get around the cancer that is paying when you are in a hurry.  There is certainly a niche for services like minibanks that I can "deposit money into" (with 2factor auth perhaps), who can contact my phone or desktop apps for authorization to spend some money on my behalf, whether one time or recurring.

Oh, also, I know you'd like to fancy yourself an armchair hero, but if the law said (like in Germany 1939) you had to gas Jews, would it be stupid for you to refuse to murder my wife?

I get your point. My suggestion is to **not** compete on their home turf.  Encroach, make new turf, redefine the properties of the turf. That is the best competition.  The kind of thing that took Google from AltaVista wannabe to "holy fuck their stock is at $1200 per share!" (they split the stock so it isn't the same now).
 &gt; - the sorts of cases where companies need that sort of performance and feature set, 
There is in practice nothing you can't do with ARM that you can do with Intel.  ARM has DMA these days. It's just a question of applying Amdahl's Law to the problem.
Did you know that Intel had to compete with DEC ALPHA (I fondly remember Miata) at some point? 
Yes, the fastest Intel dual socket CPU set could not even begin to scratch the raw power of the Miata server (our college's Miata did about four times the boot speed and the computation speed as our fastest and doubly expensive Intel server).  Guess what: you don't need to run shit so fast *because you can parallelize it*.  There is no computational job you cannot parallelize at some point unless you are mining Bitcoin.
You probably only remember Intel as being the leader of its market, but the reality is that Intel was the scrappy underdog for *literally decades* (srsly they had the 8086 which they had to downgrade to 8088, crap), and will become the also-ran soon, just as many other companies.  When you think of an Intel monopoly, what you're thinking of is simply of an era where the people got cheap chips that were cheap precisely because they figured out how to engineer cheap and shitty microcomputers as opposed to the outrageously DEC VAXes of the era. Intel is already being supplanted as the provider of chips by people who have already figured out how to supply and engineer way, way cheaper chips for nanocomputers and pocket computers as opposed to the Pentium 4s of the era.
Intel only created the prosperity they did because they surfed on IBM open microcomputer architecture (XT) for decades. IBM failed because they realized that XT was eating on their minicomputer monopoly, and decided to close it with noncopyable MCA, which nobody gave a shit about.  Openness is why PCs are here, and as soon as PCs stopped being open, tablets, phones and ARM dominated.
Eventually you get out competed. That is how the story goes. And we all benefit because we get the better stuff for ever increasingly cheap cheap cheap.

Hah.  You *think* it's that easy.
In reality, most renunciations trigger tax audits, and as soon as you pass a relatively low limit in total assets no matter where they are (remember, you have been dutifully reporting all your overseas assets to them, or you are in a cage), legally it's automatically assumed you're renouncing to evade tax.
Deportation is uncommon, but that's *only* because people usually surrender the massively extortive percentages that the worldwide robber barons demand.

You claim that your fictional figure is the righteous violence monopolist, but in observable reality the people who order and perpetrate the violence are the priests and inquisitors you obey, respectively.  And that makes the violence okay somehow.
In plain English of people doing things: your thesis is that everybody owes absolute obedience to the priests, and you recognize that the inquisitors will still put a bullet in your skull if you resist them, but these people (and presumably you too) will rationalize your murder as an act of obedience for their god.

Heh. No. If you believe this, I have bad news for you: *not even Satoshi* thinks that.
Here is what Bitcoin is supposed to be, straight from the paper itself:  Bitcoin is *not at all* supposed to be "immune to bad people". It is supposed to be immune specifically to *a minority of bad people who are all colluding to mine an alternate chain*, and even then *only for transactions older than an hour*. 


Yes. It isn't. That's the damn point about Bitcoin: *the protocol does not exclusively rely on cryptographic security -- it relies on human actions, actions from people that you have to trust if you want to use Bitcoin.*
There is no such thing as absolute cryptographic security. I'd direct you to the Ken Thompson paper "Reflections on trusting trust", but I suspect that your current cognitive state of misinformation would prevent you from understanding it, and specifically how it refutes your faithful belief cited here:


Ken would tell you that PGP can be subverted by circumventing the need to crack the encryption, perhaps by implanting a keylogger, or by swapping your interlocutor's public key in your keyring to a compromised one so your mails can be MITMd.
The NSA would agree.
 it all comes down to whom you trust. That is all. Thus, the "point of Bitcoin" cannot ever be your "immune to bad people" generalization.


This grandiose statement full of generalities is incorrect. I see you do not understand computer security. I do not think this is a productive use of my time. Bye.

Nah, totally not "actual" money laundering, you'll be here to show us the suspicious activity reports associated with those 9 trillion dollars, right?
Oh, wait, what, no suspicious activity reports?  Despite the fact that the amounts were orders of magnitude higher than the legally mandated limit?   Ah, I see.  There are no filed reports stating who is getting the money, where the money went, the addresses of the recipients, that kinda thing, you know, legally required for transfers of this amount.
Interesting, isn't it?  Cos, you see, that's the kind of thing that the criminals said entitled to kidnap Charlie and accuse him of wrongdoing.  That is the kind of thing that was mentioned in the press release defaming his character as a "money launderer".
But yeah, sure, no "actual money laundering" happened here, because when the launderers are part of the very criminal organization that gets to define what "money laundering" means for all you statist sickos, then of course there can't be money laundering.  Directive Zero and all.

They don't throw your shit away here. They just steal it. I had a coworker whose jewelry -- family heirlooms -- was robbed by fucks doing business as "the state of California".  Took her five years to get it back.
You put your money in a deposit box, where other people have a key to take out your shit (you didn't just think you were the orly one with a key, did you?) and photograph for the digital pillaging, and you would never know when you get robbed of your money.
Bitcoin and cryptography were engineered to offer you the possibility to protect you from exactly this kind of theft, but you decided to renounce that protection. You are frankly an imbecile, and I will see you again here when you are deservedly parted with your money.

Among other things, yes.


AND because the people solving the crypto puzzles act in their own self-interest too.
You talk as if crypto was some magical pixie dust you sprinkle on problems and bam, problems fixed.  Wrong.  Cryptography alone is useless.  Ultimately you still need to trust someone (in Bitcoin's case, a verifiable consensus from the miners); there will never be a protocol change or computer code that will eliminate this requirement of trust.


That's not how it is. Bitcoin relies on the self-interest of the miners as much as any other truly free market does.

What you say here is that there is a special group of privileged people who must be allowed to steal from everyone, then pool the loot in a single place, and then use a very small percentage of that money to bribe the rest of us with some services.
And, of course, you don't actually mention that said group of people spends a much larger percentage of that loot in terrorizing everyone else who disobeys them, or outright murdering them, and in many cases, strangers from other nations.

Bah. Religious magic hocus pocus doesn't turn kidnappings into not kidnappings.
But it doesn't matter, you know what I meant, don't dodge me by changing the subject, respond to my question.




Hah. You Americans think that your tax farm is the shit.  Here's some information for you: life outside the U.S., with or without a passport, *but with money*, is phenomenal.
Great weather, cheap everything, you don't need a bank account or any of that nonsense. You just have to flee and find someone who will take your money, which is everywhere nowadays.  Fleeing out is relatively easy, easier than all those Mexicans fleeing into your tax farm every day.  And plenty decent places will give you citizenship if you can pay for it, so nobody gives a shit about your magical papers.
Should not be hard to do at all, considering that we are talking about fleeing your kidnappers, who aren't going to let you spend your money in your tax farm anyway, so better to flee.
But I can see how a person with a limited perspective such as yourself would never ever consider disobeying his masters.
@_date: 2014-03-12 02:18:22


Yes. What did you read that gave you the impression I wasn't aware of that?


Are you saying that, because it's not *me* getting punished directly, it is okay for a group X to punish anyone who runs an exchange but doesn't ask X for permission?
What if it *was* me? Would you then be callous with me, like you're being callous with the people whose exchange business will be sabotaged now?
Your post is an apology for reaming strangers you don't give a shit about. That's what it is. It's full of the standard "logic" that goes "well, I never wanted to do X, therefore it's okay if someone is punished for doing X". It's insensitive and shortsighted.  Your post handwaves away the centralizing and competition sabotaging effect of the decree.

"Technically correct".
Most backdoored devices only have an internal-facing network backdoor.
Which is the network that NSA / GCHQ can easily access (see link in the paper I posted above).  All the NSA has to do is compromise any machine inside your LAN (how about the baseband processor in your phone?  a $40K machine from Wiebetech can do it, no problem), then they can use the backdoor to implant *their* backdoor in the router.  Dun dun dun.  Man on the side attack, riding shotgun, tapping all Internet traffic (which they could not do from the phone itself).
If you are not NSA, you have a lot to learn about information security.  If you are NSA, here's my honest opinion: I hope you live a long life of interesting times, where "interesting times" involves your immediate family enduring every bit of suffering you've helped engineer and inflict upon your fellow human beings.

Heh.  I could use *fewer* bully interventions, not *more*.
That's why I advocate for peaceful parenting and education -- so that children don't get abused, then learn "by example" that abuse is "effective" (look at how "effective" it was here), then grow up to be dysfunctional and intolerant adults like *you*... who can't hold a simple conversation about ideas without flipping out and descending into name-calling.
You're probably an adult so it's likely that you can't be fixed -- you are who you are, the times you were called "crazy" having seared into brain scars a long time ago, your brain is the way it is (I bet we could see decreased prefrontal cortex in brain imaging of you, or other consequences of persistent child abuse), and you will probably forever respond with abuse to anyone who questions your identity beliefs.  So when you say:


...well, *you literally can't*.  You *become* and *channel* the abuser you once endured many times a long time ago.  The problem, the thing that makes serious discussions impossible, is quite literally within *you*.
But there's hope for the children who haven't *yet* been abused.  So, while having these conversations is edutaintment for me... my real project is to make a better world, and you aren't going to be a part of it.  Sorry.

*Absolutely not*.
The people who invented the currency you graciously use today, did so because of their **ideas**.
*Etiquette* would be to pay *proper deference and respect* to these people **and their ideas**, even if you disagree with them. You may do that, but there are quite a few disrespectful and servile get rich quick rats, insulting ant taunting decent principled people, and acting like bulls in china shops here. They *obviously* don't actually pay proper respect to the inventors and their ideas.  That is terrible, but most importantly, **they are the ones stripped of all class and etiquette**. Not that they care since they are unprincipled hacks, so etiquette is alien to them.
Fact is, without these ideas and these people, your great currency would **never** have been invented; you would be stuck with a shitty ever-devaluing fiat currency and zero financial privacy. Dai, Szabo, Hal, Chaum, Satoshi, they *could* have said "fuck that, I'm not coding this, most people clearly *want* sociopaths to tell them what to do with their own money".

Yeah, that's what happens when ten different people are condescending and rude to me *first* (go check the hatred, stalking and creeps I get to tolerate daily).
[One example](  of literally tens of thousands I have received. What's in it? Hate, derision, condescension. Zero arguments, all mockery, negative adjectives, contempt, eyes rolling.
You are telling *me* that I am the rude and condescending one, and blaming me for the atmosphere? You could not be possibly more wrong. When I said these idiots are the ones running around like bulls in China shops, I said that with a *basis in fact*. Did you get death threats, or perchance people wanting you and your family to be shot / caged / robbed of all you have, merely for stating your beliefs? No? Do you have entire subreddits with hundreds of people, each with ten different sockpuppets, all devoted to astroturf all posts and stalk anyone who speaks about freedom? No?  Ah. OK. I see. Then you clearly don't understand. So let me explain with an analogy.
If I was advocating against racism, and I got told ten times a day things like "ah you dumbfuck niggers, when are you gonna grow up, you and your race-free utopia, what morons"... Would you call me rude to my face when I point out that we are surrounded by despicable bigots? *Fuck no, I don't accept that, that's enough*.
So tell me: on top of advocating voluntaryism and dealing with constant verbal abuse in a constructive way most of the time, should I become a robot as well? How many times should I tolerate being called an "idiot" by absolutely ignorant and vicious assholes (who probably get paid $10/hr in San Francisco by a "narrative control" firm, to sabotage any reasoned and calm conversation) before responding in kind?


I don't tell people how to think -- on the contrary, *they* tell me how to think all the time, and on top of that they insult me when I don't fall in line with their idiotic cult... because bigotry against voluntaryists is the last acceptable bigotry in our not yet civilized society.

Unfortunately, the mafias that are governments *already* started extorting compliance from people who are doing business with Bitcoin.  Look at what Nefario is doing and tell me: isn't his the behavior of a person fearing for his life, who has been threatened with severe punishment?
The magical words that vaguely threaten Bitcoin businesses are already written in the magical papers; now, all the mafia needs, is to get people to believe that those words really do authorize punishments against people dealing with Bitcoin in ways that the mafia dislikes.  This (inevitable) fate will be set in stone once a cultist wearing a black dress uses the magical papers to railroad a peaceful person.
(Translation for the stateless-impaired: laws that might be interpreted as "regulating Bitcoin-related activities" already exist.  When they will be reinterpreted in a lawsuit to set precedent that they apply to Bitcoin, is just a question of time.)
Make no mistake: the mafia already perceives that Bitcoin is a threat to their ultimate power -- they won't hesitate for a minute in interpreting the magical papers as "they prohibit Bitcoin"... and making *damn sure* that everyone else shares their useful delusion, either by indoctrination or by direct threats.

The problem with humans voting is **not** fraud.  Fraud is just a symptom.
The *real* problem with voting is that the people who get elected, and the people who accrete around the process, are people looking to use legitimate violence to get their way, which means they are necessarily going to be hopelessly corrupt / corruptible, and their very best skill is necessarily going to be **deceit**.
Once you understand this, you will understand how election fraud is just a byproduct of this reality.
The *true* solution is to *walk away*, to *delegitimize* and *defund* these corrupt perverts who would put you and me in a cage for interacting peacefully in ways they seek to punish violently.  That's the solution.  That's why bitcoin is so important.

The author Jim Bell thought of a number of strategies that would also give the site operator plausible deniability against such uses of the site, so he nominally wouldn't have to conceal his identity because he remains ignorant of the specific bets.  He also mentioned a rather byzantine protocol for arranging the financing part of the assassination operation, which was necessary solely because Bitcoin (or anything with Bitcoin's properties) didn't exist at the time.
If the guy who has a price on his head bets *against* his death, then that's more money that the potential assassin betting *for* his death will collect.  He would in essence be financing his own assassin.  That is exactly the opposite of what the victim wants.  Thus he must bet *for* his assassination, enough money to flip the odds of the bet, in essence subsidizing the people who want him dead, making the bet unprofitable for the assassin, and purchasing his life that way.  Iterate a few times *oppa prisoner dilemma style* -- if the guy is really hated -- and the victim will be either broke or dead.

The problem with belief in "sides of the argument" is that arguments don't really have "sides".
*Controversies* over arguments have sides.  Arguments themselves do not.  [Arguments (at least *well-formed* arguments) have premises, syllogisms and (of course) conclusions derived from the above.](  Whether the conclusion is supported or not, depends exclusively on whether the premises are valid and the syllogism is sound.  When a person accepts the premises of an argument and can't find fault with the syllogism, but still refuses to accept the conclusion, we can correctly call this person *irrational*.
Unfortunately, this commonplace error is aggravated by Wikipedia institutionalizing belief in "sides of the argument" with its NPOV policy.  They have this policy where controversial stuff or outright false stuff is allowed on the encyclopedia, so long as it can be concocted into what they call "neutral point of view" language.  Due in part to this fundamentally relativist policy, Wikipedia is a compendium of lies as much as it is a compendium of truths.
Of course, the argument that concludes Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme is, for reasons demonstrated by other people (correctly, with premises, syllogisms and conclusions), erroneous.
If someone could map the arguments surrounding the Bitcoin Ponzi controversy with these techniques  it would be very helpful.

Yes, I do.  If you try to print or mint your own currency in the U.S., and it gets real popular for trade, the Secret Service will have you put in a cage on trumped-up charges and throw away the key.  The U.S. dollar is an imposed standard (the technical term is a *fiat* currency), because its use is enforced with prison against anyone who successfully competes with it.  I direct you to official statement:


In the following page:  is a good example.  The U.S. government robbed the guy of millions of dollars of precious metals -- ruining many citizens in the process -- then called him a "terrorist", trumped up a few charges, and locked him up for good.

*Allegedly*, the solution to protect hapless people from fraudulent transactions, is to violently punish peaceful and upstanding people who engage in non-fraudulent transactions without some sort of special "holy permit", a permit which the people enabled by the magical papers *supposedly* grant.
The *excuse* to punish these peaceful and upstanding people, is that "not having the holy permit" is equivalent to "fraud".  Your comment refers to this excuse.
Of course, I say *excuse* because just one minute's worth of looking into observable reality completely disproves such a hallucinatory statement.
For example: an upstanding human being, not deserving of punishment, is perfectly capable of engaging in non-fraudulent behavior without possessing a "holy permit".
At the same time, malevolent people who possess the "holy permit" aren't impeded by the "holy permit" to engage in fraudulent behavior.
As you can see, pieces of paper change nothing, no matter how hard you believe in their magical superpowers.  Your allegation (*excuse*) has no basis in observable fact.
For those of us who are more ethics-oriented, the idea of violently punishing people who engage in non-fraudulent transactions (with or without "holy permit") sounds *malevolent*, because it's wrong to use violence against those who are peaceful and upstanding, papers or not.
That is what I said in my earlier comment.  Feel free to reread it and understand the implications, before interacting with me with the assumption that I'm somehow going to be terrorized or fazed by your pieces of paper or your belief in them.
This whole conversation reminds me of Protestantism's complaint that people with "holy papers" (indulgences) were essentially free to commit any sin ("crime" in today's language) because they were already pardoned by the authorities ahead of time.
I don't defend any religion (including Protestantism), but on *the idea that giving you pieces of paper changes nothing about the ethical nature of your behavior*, they were *right*, and I feel honored to be able to redo their argument 600 years after the fact.
Have a good day! :-)

Aha... I suspected as much.
That's **not** a truthful and accurate definition of honest.  You're underhandedly redefining "honest" to mean something that has nothing to do with honesty as understood by any normal, sane person.
Sure, you can define "honest" as "being there".  Of course, according to your own self-styled crazy definition of "honest", rapists, robbers and hitmen are "honest".  "They're there", aren't they?


This is a **lie**.  Gold can easily be manipulated.
As I said, I suspected as much: you're just another person who has a prejudiced conclusion, and you don't like that reality belies your prejudiced conclusion, so -- instead of doing the intellectually honest thing and changing your beliefs --  you just distort reality and manipulate others with verbal sophistry.  The more you're questioned on your beliefs, the more you need to distort reality and invent lies.

That's debatable.  In my observation, the main intention of permits has nothing to do with protecting anyone, and everything to do with giving favored people special powers over others, so they can profit.
However, we're not going to debate that, because that's not the topic we're talking about.  We're talking about whether it's right (ethical / morally righteous) to violently punish people who behave against the commandments written in magical papers.

Considering that they can kill me or put me in a cage, I'd rather just stay out of their sight until the whole thing collapses (which it will).
The problem, fundamentally, lies not with the rulers.  The rulers are under the delusion that they are authorized to brutalize and extort everyone who disobeys... but this delusion just wouldn't be sustainable without the tacit or explicit support of the 99.999% of people out there who share the delusion and believe that the rulers are righteous when they brutalize and ruin peaceful people.
The problem is an emergent, systemic problem.  The problem starts with the average individual and his belief structure.  Recognizing and pointing out that these people are malevolent is *not enough*.  Until the belief structure changes, the problem will never be solved.

He didn't make any "point" -- he just called my argument "wrong" and names without actually advancing a rebuttal.  That is the very point of contention here -- the fact that he has given a nonresponsive reply.
Saying "your argument / your idea / your face sucks" to someone who gave you an argument isn't a rebuttal -- it's just an insult that fearful people use to try and suspend rational thought and debate.  This type of response is what passes for "discussion" in people who can't think, and believe that argumentation consists on shouting "your argument sucks and so does your face"  past each other.
At this point, to save myself some time that might go wasted, I am going to ask you to define what a **rebuttal** is -- I need proof that discussing anything with you is worth my while, and that question is a sensible question that any healthy and educated adult can answer -- and if you can't get that right, I'll simply add you to my RES ignore list.

That's not true.  Clearly, just because you use Bitcoin, that doesn't mean you respect human beings and decline to use aggression against them to get your way.  And if you doubt this, I've got a whole side dish of Bitcointalk.org to share with you.
@_date: 2012-12-14 08:07:00
Ohh!  I know the answer to that.  This is going to be a bit long, but that's what happens when one has to describe reality in terms of people doing things rather than fantasies and abstractions.
First of all, people hate Bitcoin [because of the implication](
The implication is quite simple and clear: you are now free to use any currency you want, and engage in any transaction you want, without being supervised, controlled, or punished, by a bunch of sociopaths posing as Messianic Nanny.  You can now protect your wealth against the predations of the sociopathic organized criminals who (everybody believes) "run society".  They can't steal from you through inflation, they can't manipulate you into "investing" in their Ponzi schemes (stock market, retirement accounts, et cetera), they can't even track your transactions (provided you exercise good judgment).
See, assume for a second that you are a Big Nanny worshipper, like I just described.  Assume that you think the world needs a tiny minority of people entitled to use overwhelming violence against anyone who disobeys this tiny minority.  Assume that these people fund themselves by stealing from everyone (and, of course, most everyone believes -- Stockholm Syndrome -- that such organized robbery is "virtuos" and "not theft").  Assume I approach you and I told you "I have found a way for these sociopaths not to steal from me, not to control what I do with my money, not to discover my activities.  I have found a way to defund them, leaving them powerless."  No money, no paid killers to impose their orders (or brainwash children for twelve years), no power.
Wouldn't that be chilling?  To know that people can now protect themselves against the threats coming from the very people you worship?  You *want* them to continue to have power.  For you, anyone who can debilitate or negate their power, must necessarily be your enemy, and whatever they use to achieve these goals is a dangerous weapon that should be banned, defamed, propagandized into oblivion.  Their users attacked.  Their fans defamed.  Their exchanges and congregation places closed or otherwise sabotaged.  And it better be done yesterday.
Imagine having to ask yourself the question "If money can be done without government, what do we need government for?".   That's the question that Bitcoin detractors are trying **so frigging hard** to suppress from their (and everyone else's) minds.  Bitcoin could quite literally and undeniably give everyone the (obvious) answer to that question.
People already fear anything they can't understand -- and they fear it more when it threatens their established preconception of the world (namely: them as the lowly caste who must obey, and Nanny as the ever-seeing "protector" that can squash, ruin or kill them pretty much whenever they want).  Bitcoin goes directly to the *very psychology* of the vast majority of (mentally castrated) individuals, and forces them to reconsider the role of the sociopaths they worship.  This *has got* to be the most spine-chilling thing they can hear.
Bitcoin, in their minds, is quite literally their enemy.  It's the precursor to "world collapse" (at least as they see the world).  Y'understand how Bitcoin, once the implications dawn on them, is a **Big No No** in their ideological book of terror.   Now you know why the PR guide for Bitcoin says "avoid mentioning drugs and other illegal activity in connection with Bitcoin".  Now you know why Satoshi Nakamoto is a pseudonym.  Or do you really think that the people who control the money are going to let anyone live to release something like Bitcoin to the world?
Fully fifty percent of the people out there are partially or fully dependent in some way or the other from the crumbs that the sociopaths I mentioned bribe them with.  What do you think their reaction is going to be, when the source of all the gravy they've become used to, is threatened?
That's what Bitcoin can do.  In turn, that's why you see the **hostile and non-responsive** replies , but zero actual rebuttals to this comment ([vivid example of someone who seems hopelessly unable to construct a rebuttal](
Second: right now, there is a concerted campaign of attention (disinformation, propaganda, attacks, slander and vote rigging) by a group of people known as the EnoughPaulSpam crew -- people who get together and propagandize, a la ShitRedditSays style, against any idea that might question the sociopaths who run society.  They have been particularly active lately, because the popularity of the Bitcoin article in the subreddit caught their eye, and -- to them -- Bitcoin is some sort of libertarian idea (which obviously pushes their buttons).  Expect more drive-bys with clusters of 40 or 50 downvotes together.
This ought to answer your question.

I didn't make any argument.  I just explicitly pointed out the tacit implication of yours.
That act of mine certainly didn't warrant your sarcastic and condescending response.
So I ask:
- Do you have a problem with what I said?
- Am I not "allowed" to notice that it appears you believe discouraging lending is bad?
- Are your dogmas sacred cows that I am not "allowed" to question, or even *point out*?
- Should I expect to get sarcasm and condescension from you every time I say something you dislike?
- Why do you evade by changing the topic, from discouragement of lending, to remarks about me or other people?

Sure!  That could, in principle and in reality, happen.  In fact, that *has* happened.  We have two examples of that: testnet and Namecoin.  They are not used for monetary transactions, but they could be, right?
So you could clearly imagine something like Microsoft Points, or Facebook Credits, or Google Wallet Googols, being backed by entirely new and independent bitcoin protocol blockchains.  They could trade for dollars, or standard Bitcoins, or rupees, or gold coins.
And that's a *Good Thing*!
The best part about this -- and perhaps the reason why nobody yet is looking seriously at Bitcoin to back their private currencies -- is that any private currency invented this way, can't just be "printed willy nilly" out of thin air (though they could extend the protocol to make sure that only they are the authorized issuers).  Any private currency issuer with a vested interest in devaluating its "funny money" currency, would not choose the bitcoin protocol for that.

See, that's the thing, my man, **no one** understands the word "crime" to mean that.  The vast majority of people (including your interlocutor) understands crime to be *disobedience of certain magical pieces of paper*.
If you want to communicate *your concept*, it's futile to refer to that concept by a word that other people understand differently. *I* understand what you *mean*, but most people's concept handling abilities are far too primitive for your message to come across to them.  If you use the word *crime* to refer to the concept you're sharing, they'll *latch to your use of the word crime*, like ticks, making it impossible for you to actually *make your point*.  Which gives what they really want -- they want to prevent you, at all costs, from making the point that the law is malevolent.
(That they also believe the pieces of paper dictate right and wrong, is sadly true as well in most cases, but it's pee from a different toilet.  Once you have explained the distinction of "this piece of paper says you're prohibited from doing X" and "X is not wrong to do", you can be in a position to judge whether your interlocutor is a sociopath, a moral child who has a primitive rule-based morality, or an adult capable of distinguishing when the law itself is wrong).

Small note: The expression "personal truth" is a logical contradiction in terms.  Truth means **correspondence with reality** -- when a truth-bearing statement is true, it's true for **everyone** and it is **intersubjectively verifiable** at least in principle.  If a statement is "true" only for yourself, it would more accurately be called an "opinion".
Examples of opinions:
- "Ice cream is the best food".  This happens to be the case only for certain individuals.  Therefore, it is an opinion.
- "Some people assert that ice cream is the best food".  This is a truth-bearing statement that *happens* to be true, so long as just one individual (or arguably two) have asserted "Ice cream is the best food".
- "The Sun is about eight light-minutes away from the Earth, give or take a few seconds".  This is also a truth-bearing statement, just as intersubjectively verifiable as the previous statement.
It's important to know the difference, otherwise people might abuse the word "truth" to try and confuse, or frustrate you.
@_date: 2012-12-23 05:29:17

This made me LOL (not because you're wrong, what you're saying is what any sensible human being would have thought) because a shakedown doesn't usually end with the victim saying "okay okay, I'll quit".  No.  The purpose of the shakedown is to get something from the victim.  In this case, it's most assuredly the names and addresses of the people involved.
Oh no, they aren't going to be content with just letting this guy go and this one pass.  That's not how it works.  When they get you, they'll get their pound of flesh.
And there's huge potential here.  Huuuuuge potential for the careers of the cocksuckers behind Nefario's on-the-surface incoherent actions.  We're talking tens of arrests, front page news, "These heroic law enforcement officers and bureaucrats took down a massive money laundering conspiracy", big-time fame, the truth be fucked.
Don't for a second doubt that this is their angle.  It is.  There is **nothing** more destructive than a bureaucrat trying to advance.  They'll railroad anyone just to get a promotion.  After all, they *did* choose government as a criminal career, deep down because they could get away with pretty much anything.

ledger reg cash receivab
That's it.


In any accounting package, you'd enter the transaction as a transaction between the cash and the account receivable, right?  Of course, this will leave an unpaid balance in the account receivable (which was supposed to be zeroed out at this point by the deposit).  Your software will let you know of that (`ledger bal receiv` in ledger), at which point you need to call the guy and say "hey dude, pay up", and when he pays up, then you enter a new transaction to record that fact.
It is no different with ledger than it is with any other double-entry accounting system.

And it's even worse when the *excuses* you give to be hostile to truth is "well, words can be used to justify pretty much anything" (that borders on intellectual dishonesty).

Yeah, that's **why** it's so good.


I run my entire investments operation using Ledger.  Unlike other accounting software, and contrary to what you claim, Ledger **does not** allow the user to make mistakes.
If you type 8 words per minute, I can see how you would prefer inefficient pointy clicky drop down menus.  For people who type fast, (and who know how to use copy paste, for the often-repeated transactions), Ledger is unsurpassed.  Its multi-currency support with inline exchange rates, and automatic calculation of gains in your investments, have no parallel.
Believe me, I thought the same things you did.  I followed the tutorial in the manual (which took me all of 20 minutes), and my mind was changed.  Trust me, if you don't want to invest 20 minutes figuring this thing out, you deserve to use an inefficient accounting package ;-)

@_date: 2012-09-09 09:46:39
It's funny because you are trying to discredit me by accusing me of "bias"... which describes your own behavior perfectly!
See, you engage in this bias of using a "magical" word ("taxation") to describe a *certain* group of people commiting organized extortion, but *only when that group of people* does it, and never when anyone else does *the exact same thing*.  When others do it, it's "theft" or "racketeering".  When the people you worship do *the exact same thing*, you call that "taxation".
Remind me again, how is that *not bias*?  Cos you're doing exactly what religious fundies do when they say "God is the most perfect moral being" and then suddenly murdering everybody in the planet is "moral", but *only if God does it*.
You even gave a bullshit excuse to rationalize this organized extortion, *knowing full well* that the excuse would *never fly* with *any other case* of organized extortion other than the one perpetrated by the group of people you worship.  People even *pointed this failure of yours* out.  What did you do in response?  You prevaricated and fogged even more, issuing reflexive retaliatory downvotes to everyone who disagreed with you.  Again, behavior modeled exactly after religious fundies who get very angry when someone points out that their God is, judging *by its own moral rules*, probably the most venal imaginary invention ever to be described in a book.
I don't think I need to point out, but I will anyway: your nonresponsive, prevaricative and verbally abusive behavior is a dead giveaway that you're full of shit and you know it.  If your inexplicably irrational behavior is "not bias" (of the archoexceptionalist variety), then all dictionaries in the planet must certainly be wrong.  I don't think they're wrong.
And yes, I checked the dictionary, and I'm pretty sure that plainly reporting observable events qualifies as the *opposite* of any sort of bias.  Meanwhile, papering over the actual observable events with euphemistic terms that *don't* convey what *actually happens*, is actually a very clear and obvious bias *in favor of hiding the truth*.
Of course, your original comment and my original comment both remain here for other people to judge who's really the "biased" one: the person describing organized extortion in plain everyday terms, or the person defending organized extortion using euphemisms.
I recognize that, obviously, your "game" here is gonna be to to discredit me and prevaricate left and right without actually addressing or refuting anything I said.
Because, of course, I told the verifiable and observable truth, and you can't deny the undeniable.  You can't deny that a group of people take stuff from others.  You can't deny that they do this in an organized manner.  You can't deny that this group of people punishes anyone who resists them, sometimes even brutally so.  You can't deny that these people squander the loot on themselves and their friends either.  You just can't cover that up, not with euphemisms and not with lies.
So what else are you to do, if not to behave venally and dishonestly to protect your dogmatic mythology of archoexceptionalism from the truth?
For the aforementioned reasons, I *completely expected* you to act venally.  And you totally delivered.
You're fucked, dude.  Just leave.

Pretty uninformative article, rife with statist dogma about the origin of money (false) and other myths from the statist mythology.
BUT, BUT, the article is certainly correct in its conclusion: Bitcoin absolutely does not work as "public money" (money to be spent by any State), since the State can't control it like it does with fiat money, and can't tax it like it does with money that circulates in the statist financial system.
And that's the point of Bitcoin.

Good for you!  At least now manned up and actually said what's on your mind, instead of just vaguely implying it.
Now, I have to confess, this insult bothered me a bit -- but not for the reasons you might think.
I deal with morons like you all the time, who accuse me of "hypocrisy" because I drive my car in public roads, because I drink tap water, because I use green pieces of paper to pay for things.
So it gets old.  Especially because said morons never actually have thought, even for a second, that if you try to compete with the criminal organization providing these "services", that criminal organization will literally kneecap or rob you.
The organization *legally requires me* to report fraud, so technically I have no choice in the matter.  The organization will violently punish any independent justice agency that forces him to pay me.  The organization will violently punish me, if I attempt to find this guy and make him pay.
This criminal organization that I'm speaking of, literally puts me between a rock and a hard place.  **They leave me with no choice but to go to them.**  Great business plan, *if* you're a sociopath.
What's your answer to that?  That I can avoid being called a "hypocrite" by Internet strangers, if I only "take the fraud like a man" and *do nothing*?  What good would *that* do to me or the rest of society?  I just let the fraudster run around?  Is that your "non-hypocritical solution"?  What if he scams you next?  Or your sister?  "Well it'd be their own damn fault because we was too stupid!"?
Well, fuck that.  To accuse me of hypocrisy, is to accuse a kidnapped person of "faking your kidnapping" just because he ate the gruel that the kidnapper provided.  It's a horrible thing to do on your part, it's *false*, it's unempathetic bordering on sociopathy, and it's *wrong*.  Fuck that, and fuck you too.

Detailed example.
Say a few disgruntled people (couple million) want JFK dead, because, who knows, he's a womanizer or something.
Someone sets up a betting pool in betsofbitco.in.  This bet will say "On or before November 22, 1963, that guy JFK will be confirmed dead".  These million people eventually get wind of the pool, and chip in on the action, to the tune of 0.1 BTC each.  They all bet "JFK lives" -- that is, "hoping" that the statement will turn out to be false.  Now the pool contains a million dollars (10$=1BTC), payable fully anonymously in principle to anyone who bets for JFK's death.
                                      JFK pool
    JFK LIVES: 100.000 BTC               --                    JFK DIES: 0
An wild assassin appears. Dude doesn't even need to hate the guy particularly -- he just wants cash.  He could thus bet 0.1 BTC, meaning that the odds are now officially a million to one in favor of "JFK lives".  So, you see, if the assassin kills JFK, he cashes out handsomely.
                                      JFK pool
    JFK LIVES: 100.000 BTC               1M:1                  JFK DIES: 0.1 BTC
Now, the assassin perches himself atop a building, and fires the bullet that kills JFK.  He executes a flawless escape and is never to be seen again, perhaps leaving behind a patsy like Lee Harvey Oswald.  Later that night, he logs onto TOR and receives the million dollars.  No one is none the wiser to this.
So how can JFK survive this?  Well, he can pony up two million of his own money, before November 22, 1963.  He places a bet on "JFK dies".
                                      JFK pool
    JFK LIVES: 100.000 BTC               1:2                   JFK DIES: 200.000,1 BTC
When he does this, the odds change (from 1M to 1 favoring "JFK lives") to a safe 2 to 1 favoring "JFK dies".  This cockblocks the assassin from cashing out handsomely -- if the assassin kills JFK, he'll  half of his own 0.1 BTC bet.  Conversely, if JFK lives, he loses the bet, but gets to keep his womanizing life.
Does this make more sense?

People are using Bitcoin primarily to save.  That is because it's far more protective of your savings than paper currencies.
There will soon come a time where there will be a real economy in selling and buying stuff using BTC, that will dwarf the savings.  Of course.  But in the meantime, asking people to do a thing that is contrary to their interestes... is probably not going to fly.

Saying "NO YOURE WRONG" is not an argument.
Given the fact that you do nothing but contradict other people (not even ask a question) and downvote anyone who questions your beliefs, it's safe to say that you're not interested in any constructive conversation or harbor any curiosity about your own beliefs -- you are merely trying to reaffirm your own faith in superstitions.
I will grant your wish and stop talking to you, so you can happily keep your beliefs untarnished by reality.  In the meantime, your interlocutor (who is factually correct) has more exposure than you, and his comment has more reputation than yours, so your vocal denial of reality matters not.

The article that started it all:
It's interesting to think: people crazy and malevolent enough to implement this as a futures pool a la betsofbitco.in... they **could** implement it:
1. The people who want someone dead (murder conspirators) would actually bet **against** the victim's death at a certain date (so as to deliberate lose this bet).
2. The assassins would bet a minimal amount **for** the victim's death.  When they execute the victim they collect an inordinate amount of money from the conspirators' pool.
3. The victim could, of course, buy his life by betting **for** his death, enough money to switch the odds favoring the assassin to favor the conspirators, so that assassins *lose* money if he dies and the conspirators *make* money... and, hopefully, when the future of the bet matures, the victim gets to lose his life-saving bet and lives to tell the story.
Mind-bogglingly confusing and, most of all, plainly terrifying.  Millions of broke Justin Bieber fans will be very sad if this comes to pass.

See, this is exactly the very kind of thing that I don't want to explain or define.  I don't want to tell people "well, you see, there are no wallets, but people use wallets or wads or money clips or..." because, by the time I am done, people will be yawning.


Yes, but if I tell people "You have a wad of Bitcoin addresses" instead of "You have a wallet", that will be the very moment that they go "huh?  that's fucking dumb, who goes around with a wad of addresses in their pocket?".
Hence, the metaphor of a wallet.
I want to keep the wallet metaphor because the wallet metaphor allows me to distinguish between "this is an address where you send money to", and "this is your *collection* of addresses".  This allows me to later on explain pseudonymity.

Well, you can't possibly tell me what's on my mind.  You can attempt to *deduce* what's on my mind, but that's about it.


Ahhh!  I see!
You've concluded that disbelief in the magical pieces of paper gets you put in a cage or killed.  And therefore, since I care about living and not being in a cage, I must consider those magical pieces of paper "relevant".
I see what you did there!  It's the classic mistake of A implies B **to you**, and everyone else accepts A, therefore everyone else surely must believe B.  It's a simple mistake in rational deduction, where *your* "A implies B" premise applies to *you*, buit doesn't apply to everyone else.
I can totally understand that, given your faith in the pieces of paper.  Just like I can totally understand how a person who really believes he will go to eternal fire if he doesn't believe in the Bible, must totally fear for the life and well-being of apostates.  It's genuine concern, as far as the believer knows.
It makes sense, of course, right?  If you believe in the pieces of paper so hard, and you consider that the pieces of paper are relevant, I can understand how you totally would pŕoject those emotions onto someone else and conclude that said someone else must obviously care about the pieces of paper and consider them relevant.
Yet I'm here, totally disbelieving those pieces of paper, and not in a cage, and not dead, and very much alive and kicking, and very happy.
Well, if the pieces of paper are allegedly relevant to me, and disobeying them gets me in a cage or dead, how do you explain the facts laid out in the previous paragraph?
(That was kinda like asking a fundie religious person "How come God hasn't yet smitten me with a lightning bolt?"  Silly question, but it's silly because it presupposes a crazy premise on the part of the crazy believer.)
Thanks for your concern, but I'll be alright!  I know how to avoid the sociopaths who share your belief in the magical pieces of paper, so there's no need to worry about my well-being.  :-)

I am a voluntaryist, and I get similar reactions from people when I tell them that the only ethical way of relating to each other is the voluntary way (which has obvious implications for government activities).
Both Bitcoin and voluntaryism make people *anxious*, because they go straight against their preconceptions of how the world ought to be -- and those preconceptions are planted in their brains straight by government employees (through schools and mass media) and their parents / close ones.
Anything threatening those preconceptions generates negative emotions similar to being attacked personally, so you can expect reflex reactions of defending them, and one of them -- the one you and piranha witnessed personally -- is *denial*.
The government doesn't even need to plant unfavorable stories about Bitcoin in mass media -- the venal people working for mass media will do the job of slandering Bitcoin *purely on their own*, because doing otherwise would threaten their cozy relationship with government.  These people believe that anything threatening the hegemony of their idols, must necessarily be malevolent and needs to be stabbed in the back ASAP.  "What, Bitcoin may compete with the dollar some day?  Well then, let's write a nice news story, light on facts and heavy on vague allegations, tendentious accusations and tacit defamation!"

So, for all **practical** intents and purposes, it's like having a bunch of coins of different denominations, all together in a purse, and the addresses aren't even seen by the payer at payment time either.
Hence, wallet.
Notice how the Python module you quoted is called py*wallet* rather than py*bunchaaddresses*?
I'm being practical here.  The implementation details are precisely the kind of thing I am trying to hide from the person who will yawn and say "Boring!  Oh, look, pictures of bunnies...".  Who cares if the end user really only manages a collection of addresses?  Nobody.  All that people care about, is that their bunch of addresses functions *very much like a wallet* from which they take coins out and use them to pay, getting change.
Put yourself in the shoes of a person who has only ever used cash or cards in their wallet.  What is the word that conveys here a more immediate understanding of how to use Bitcoin practically, if not "wallet"?

Bitcoin doesn't change anything for the buyer.  It just moves the responsibility of fraud resolution to the buyer himself.

The problem is that you are using the word *crime* to mean *wrong*.
Abandon the use of statist words to describe right or wrong, because the statist will usually try to confuse the two.  Rape is a crime and it's also wrong.  Murdering others when you're wearing certain costumes is *not* a crime, but it *is* wrong.  The distinction is important because you're appealing to your interlocutor to understand that *punishing* people for consensual trade is *wrong*, regardless of whether it is a crime or not.

WAT.  Where did you get the idea that ledger requires you to write stuff in MULTIPLE files?????
You haven't even read the documentation  well, man!
Look, here's an example.  It's dead simple:
    2012/03/12 * Sale of Amazon GC
    	Assets:Wallets:Karen			BTC        5.2 @ $4.8076923076923075
    	Currency:BTC				BTC       -5.2 @ $4.8076923076923075
    	Fund:Deposits:Amazon gift cards   $      -25
    	Currency:USD				$         25
That's a whole transaciton, right there, dead fucking simple.  And if it has four lines, it's only because I've chosen a Currency trading accounting method (which is entirely optional and merely a question of taste).
I have hundreds of these transactions in the same file, and that's the only file I edit.

Well, to my understanding, "demos" and "kratia" mean that the people elect (indirectly or directly, irrelevant) a bunch of cocksucking sociopaths to tell everyone how to live their lives, and brutally ruin, cage or kill those who disobey the orders.
Of course, said group of sociopaths alleges that their power comes from the ~~belief~~votes that people cast for them.  So the less we have of that ~~belief~~, the better.
Now, "democracy" in the context of making other types of decisions (e.g. where voting was deliberately and informedly accepted a priori as a mechanism to resolve disputes by all participants), I'm cool with that.  But that isn't democracy to my understanding -- that's just voting.

I've turned into what's been recently dubbed a "libertarian bitch".  They kidnap me and my labor, no problem, might as well eat the gruel they offer... *as much* of it as it's available, and *then throw* some on the floor so it goes to waste and bankrupts their criminal operation.

Sorry -- I am not going to help you play the dishonest game of "you claim one thing, then I point out a flaw in your claim, then you ignore my rebuttal and, instead, claim a different thing".  I have better things to do, and I am certainly not obligated to respond to anything you say -- when I do so, I do it at my leisure.
OK.  Your behavior has now convinced me sufficiently, that you are engaging in selective thinking.  
You are, indeed, singling out Bitcoin, by emphasizing risks inherent in all currencies and pretending they are problems only for Bitcoin, and then by emphasizing positive attributes inherent in certain currencies and pretending that Bitcoin doesn't enjoy those positive attributes.  You did the first when you claimed that Bitcoin bubbles are possible while neglecting to mention that bubbles are possible all other currencies; when I responded to that, you changed the subject.  You did the second when you claimed that gold and silver have a self-corrective mechanism that Bitcoin does not have (a falsehood, since Bitcoin also has the same corrective mechanism).
Since your statements product of selective thinking seem to be obviously counterfactual, it is likely to conclude that  you will not be persuaded by anything I say, no matter how hard the evidence I present to you is.  Thus, this conversation is futile.

Yes, of course, in literal terms, there exist some magical pieces of paper that describe the notion of "tax evasion" as a specific kind of human action, label that action "tax evasion", call it a "crime", and then prescribe a violent punishment against anybody who engages in it.
That was not the definition of "actual crime" your interlocutor was using.  His definition implies that acts such as "tax evasion" -- more literally and accurately described as "protecting one's property against organized theft" -- is not "actual crime" but rather a "made-up crime".  Which it is -- all crimes are made-up by the people who write the magical papers I referred to in the last paragraph.

Repost from Bitcointalk:
I have a solution to the Bitcoin and taxes thing.
1. Realize that Bitcoin makes it impossible for organized criminals to steal from you through inflation.  That is, in and of itself, a great improvement over the previous situation.
2. Have a public address that will be "taxable", and do perhaps the majority of your business through there, reporting taxes from this business etcetera etcetera.
Keep a second set of books (addresses, etc, one per customer), and use them to evade taxes -- for those people with whom you have developed a trust relationship, give them a 10% or so discount on the condition that they keep their transactions with you on the DL and go through a mixer.  If one of them sells you or rats you out, well, (a) he'd be incriminating himself, (b) you will know beyond a doubt because of evidentiary discovery, and then you can use this information to rightfully defame this rat.
Result: You make extra money, they make extra money, and the organized criminals can get fucked.  Everyone who is good wins.  If you do this right, you and your customers manage to cooperate to defund the organized criminals, and everyone benefits.  If enough people do this, the halving (or more) of the loot that the organized criminals get to steal every year will seriously impact their ability to continue controlling everyone, if not just flat out bring them down.
Save this extra money, because you'll get to spend it or gift it, the very day that the influence of the organized criminals ends.

They're not, as far as anyone is concerned with legal precedent or observable facts.
However, legal extortion is usually enough to make people cower down and **pretend** like yes, Bitcoin is money, thus Bitcoin exchanges must obey the AML and KYC market sabotages.  Very few people have the will to resist this, because they won't walk away unharmed by the Mafia.  This extortion will no doubt help set the legal precedent that will firmly establish governments are allowed to punish people for trading Bitcoin in "unauthorized" ways.
Remember that the name of the game for government is to **get people to embrace the falsehoods that they dictate**.  If they need to terrorize a few people and ruin some businesses to get their way, they'll do it *happily*.  Everyone else who witnesses this Mafia (already pretending that the Mafia is legitimate) will find the excuses necessary to "concur".

@_date: 2012-06-18 23:58:37


I'll go one step further: Hopefully all governments have collapsed and their activities have been replaced with peaceful market institutions.
There is a *reason* why governments collect income and profit taxes.  The very idea of government is cemented on the notion that you are tax livestock -- that the rulers own your body -- and thus they own your productivity and autonomy.  As their property that you are, they consider themselves entitled to whatever you make and thus "own" (which is ownership in name only, as many Supreme Courts have already appointed the government as supreme owners of everything, only *allowing* you limited use of the things you think you own).
Thus, it should come as no surprise that half the productivity you exercise every year, does not go to your pockets, but goes to the *rulers'* pockets.  Any and all taxes are aggressive claims of ultimate ownership over things that the tax livestock have.  The income tax is just a "more honest" (direct) admission that they own you.  And any tiny expenses that the rulers make to (allegedly) "protect" you, are no different in principle than any farmer spending money on his livestock to keep it productive and healthy.

Exactly.  This is why Bitcoin is a game changer.
Do not  get me wrong: violent people (of the costumed kind) can still kidnap you until you pay up.  This is a given, and this won't end until people accept that violence does not solve social problems.
But -- and this is key -- unlike cash, personal possessions, or precious metals, when these cocksuckers release you, all your Bitcoins will *still* be in your brain... and they will have probably gained value!
Would you pay up if you are threatened with being caged for five years, knowing that while you are in a cage, your kidnappers will identify, find and take everything you have (under the false pretense that you owe them)?  Sure, most likely you will pay up under these circumstances. 
But what if, what if, they *couldn't* take your large nest egg of savings, because it resides somewhere in your brain?  What if you were forced to spend a few years in a cage, but then you could get out and go pretty much anywhere, still rich or at least well off enough that you don't have to start from zero?
Seriously, think about it: What if you managed to brainwall, away from these lunatics, something close to a quarter of a million dollars' worth of Bitcoin... to be worth perhaps half a million when they give up and release you?  Maybe five years in a cage, surrounded by non-violent people like you, dining at the expense of these lunatics, maybe that doesn't sound so bad.
Under those circumstances, the violent lunatics have no choice but to eternally kidnap and cage their victims until they are dead, or slaughter them.  When that starts happening, the collapse of their power over everyone, along with open resistance by the populace (who vastly outnumber them) is not very far away.
This is why Bitcoin is a game changer, of a sort that cash and gold never were and never could be.  You see, paper and gold can always be stolen, and people can be murdered, but *thoughts*?  Given enough resolve, your thoughts will only ever be yours.

It's the exact same process that got the Jews gassed, and the exact same process that got the Russians in gulags by the millions, and the eaxct same process that has millions upon millions Americans in cages today.

The people acting "on behalf" of the pieces of paper still got them caged, gassed, murdered.

You appear not to understand how this would be implemented.  I have some Internet experience, having worked as a systems and network engineer for 13 years, so let me explain a bit more.
This deliberate disruption would be implemented by selectively or completely shutting down traffic at level 1 or level 2 carriers.  This would not be hard to do, since most of those links already have bypasses that feed into secretive government organizations.
Which secretive organizations?  How about the NSA (Echelon, confirmed by the AT&amp;T San Francisco building, Room 641A at 611 Folsom -- also the former headquarters of Twitter -- [when a whistleblower exposed this fiber splicing scandal](  How about the FBI (remember Carnivore?).
No, this is not a "conspiracy theory" -- it is an actual *conspiracy* -- id est, a group of people from government, conspiring to spy on everyone, with an unprecedented ability to suppress communications too, and now with a newly-created "legal right" to actually exercise this ability -- that is happening right now.
So, in the event that the President exercises this new self-appointed authority, remember all those private links you mentioned?  They would be rendered useless and inoperative.  BGP routing announcements would not be able to get past these crucial links.  The result is that either all, or most, or a targeted set of sites would be nullrouted or unreachable.
End game.  You lose.
Inb4 darknet: won't work unless in the extremely unlikely scenario that you have a viable darknet with physical links already in place, and it does not rely on Internet infrastructure, and it has not already been intervened by government, and it doesn't "occur" to government to throw you in a cage for operating such a thing without their permission.

No, not really.  Just saying "strawman" is not a valid rebuttal.  It's just labeling, another form of name calling.
The accusation that an argument X is "a strawman" is only a valid rebuttal if (a) X *was* indeed a strawman, and (b) the rebuttal where X is called "a strawman" actually substantiates the accusation.
But no one has done such a thing yet.  As such, saying "your argument is a strawman" without substantiation, is, yet again, another example of namecalling.
Namecalling is what people do to defend themselves from ideas when they can't think.  &lt;- This is not part of the argument, just so you know and don't get confused by a very obvious fact.

It's not.  It's just a question of how.  I wonder how governments will attempt to tax Bitcoin, but I am afraid the answer is likely going to be even more intrusions into people's businesses and lives.
Already governments can track how money goes in and out of the Bitcoin economy; now, FinCEN provisions "authorize" the U.S. government to subpoena or query U.S. based businesses selling and buying Bitcoin (who must necessarily, or willingly choose to, be classified as financial institutions) for who is buying how much Bitcoin when, and to jail anyone who deals in Bitcoin without their "authorization".
Combine this with the blockchain, and money is 100% traceable in a way that wasn't even possible before.  So they *will* know when you buy that nice Lexus with Bitcoin, you have "evaded taxes".  And they *will* know when you bought BTC1000 at $5 and sold them at $6 -- do you think they're gonna let you just *walk* without extorting you a sweet 35% out of your "profit"?  Given the right threats levied on the right people, Bitcoin is a tax livestock owner's dream.
Remember: government's "business" is fundamentally organized extortion against peaceful people, to enslave them, live off their backs, and kidnap or kill anyone who resists them meaningfully.  *Dumb* they are *not*, not even in the slightest -- think about it: these people we're dealing with, have managed to get *everyone* to call worthless pieces of paper "money" and real non-counterfeitable money "funny money".  You think they're going to just *let you go* with your money?
The *single worst* thing you can do for yourself, is underestimate their malevolent power and obsession to control human beings.

I don't see how this is a problem.  You could either lose or win money by someone manipulating exchange rates, with equal likelihood, so statistically it's a net zero loss for you and you have nothing to be afraid.  You bought at too expensive a price?  Aww, that's sad, but that's *normal*.  Bid and ask, of any commodity, may tend to zero difference, but the difference at any point in time is never actually zero.  This situation gives arbitrageurs a chance to profit.  So?
There's no such thing as a "perfect market", at least not according to how you describe perfect markets.  Anywhere.  With any currency.  With any commodity.  With anything.  Anything you do, buy, sell, keep, go long, go short, is always subject to risk -- it is up to you to decide which risk you prefer.  The only financially riskless position is to have zero of everything and anything.

Paying an account receivable, from here: 


ledger reg cash receivab
That's it.


In any accounting package, you'd enter the transaction as a transaction between the cash and the account receivable, right?  Of course, this will leave an unpaid balance in the account receivable (which was supposed to be zeroed out at this point by the deposit).  Your software will let you know of that (`ledger bal receiv` in ledger), at which point you need to call the guy and say "hey dude, pay up", and when he pays up, then you enter a new transaction to record that fact.  Now the balance of the receivables should be zero.

This is unnecessary with ledger since the account entries for each transaction visually follow each other.  The problems you are experiencing I experienced too.  I stopped having those problems when I started using ledger.


The first error is an accounting error on your part, and ledger will let you know you have made that mistake, because the accounts won't balance to zero.
The second error is a human error on the part of the payee, and ledger will let you know that you have an outstanding payment, if you ask ledger to give you that information by querying your accounts receivable account.

To be fair, I did not disprove the "existence" of crime.  I can't disprove oxymorons, nor do I need to, nor do I want to, nor do I give a shit.
"Crime" is merely a taxonomic category of actions -- it is a *deductive judgment* based on the contents of certain pieces of paper.
Existence is defined as having shape and position in the Universe.  So, sure, there exist some pieces of paper, and their contents categorize certain human actions in "non-crimes" and "crimes".  The pieces of paper exist.  The actions exist.  The human beings exist.  Those are all features of reality.
But whether an action is classified as a crime or not by the pieces of paper?  That's an entirely arbitrary opinion written in the magical pieces of paper by some very opinionated people who want to control you for their psychic or their economic profit.
When people say "there's a lot of crime", that's only a *metaphorical* statement that means nothing more than "there are a lot of people who are committing actions that can be classified as crimes, according to these pieces of paper that I have faith in".
As such, crime is purely an abstract concept that does not refer to any particular object or action in reality.  Does "crime" have position or shape?  No, it does not.  It couldn't, because abstract concepts by their own nature refer not to objects in reality, but to thoughts.  Therefore, the word existence doesn't even apply.
Perhaps you are confused and want to discuss the **validity** or the **ethics** of the concept you call "crime"?  Those are *different* things, unrelated to existence.

Erase blocks in SSDs are AT LEAST 128K (half a meg in modern ones).
So, to summarize, you got the encryption layer having to read a full stripe (4 to 16K) to mesh the eight bytes, re-encrypt everything in memory, and then submitting the write to the SSD, which then needs to read the whole erase block (128K) and write it completely again in an other area of the disk (automatically done by the firmware).

This man is correct.  Bitcoin *cannot* serve the public function of money.  Phew!  That is a **good thing**, because the public function of money is to fund mass murderers and control freaks, and we want **less** of that.
The rest of the article, of course, is nothing but statist falsehoods like "the origin of money is tribute".  No, no it's not, money was invented before organized criminals under the name of "states" started robbing people.  But of course, the statist has to engage in creationist reversals of time and space, and lie about history and observable reality, to make his crazy superstitions believable.  That much, we knew already.

Other countries have already done that. In Ecuador, everyone is legally required to get your name for a bill for any transaction above $10.  Everyone bitched about that, but the law stayed on the books.  Similar provisions in many places already exist, such as Italy.
Compared to cash, Bitcoin is quite an easier target for such a law.


They don't need to get you in this way.  All they need, is invent some magical words that makes you record your transactions and report them.  If they audit you and they discover that you've been concealing info from them, off to a cage it is.  They don't even need to show that you've committed a wrong deed -- a clerical mistake is automatically a *malum prohibitum*.

Holy... I honestly do not know what you're doing as far as accounting goes.
In my world, whenever someone promises to pay for something I sold him (at the time of invoicing, so to speak), what takes place is something like this:
- Assets:Inventory:   -50 dollars
- A/R account of the customer: +100 dollars  (you made a profit of 50 dollars over your cost basis, using a FIFO lot methodology)
- Income:      +50 dollars
When he pays the invoice (at a later date), it's another transaction that cancels out the A/R entry I made above, crediting the money to the cash account where he/you deposited the payment:
- A/R account of customer: -100 dollars
- Assets:Wallet:Bitcoin: 100 dollars.

Not at all.  I am just informing you that you are constitutionally unable to separate "I believe X" from "X is".  Just like any other religious fundie out there.
As I already stated, "avoiding prison" does not mean "obeying the law".  I do not obey the law -- I avoid prison.  One and the other are not the same thing.  Just like "being good" and "obeying the Ten Commandments" are not the same thing either.
Only a person thoroughly indoctrinated in the obedience of pieces of paper, who cannot conceive anything other than obedience to these pieces of paper, could believe that others who avoid prison do so *solely* because of their "obedience to the pieces of paper".
That's your confusion to deal with, not mine.


I think I'm just bored with your continued attempts to humiliate me.
People with great, correct, sound arguments, do not need to dig at their interlocutors -- they just need to say the truth.
From that standpoint, your comment history speaks about you on its own.
You are literally deducing the wrong thing from your observations, then prematurely gloating about how you're "right", while being completely obfuscated by your faith in pieces of paper and authorities.  That mental process of yours doesn't make you right -- it only makes you wrong *and* unable to correct your mistake.
Since your obfuscation prevents you from using your mind (other than to devise "clever" ways to humiliate people you disagree with), this is a waste of time for me.  As I said earlier: *good bye*.

@_date: 2012-11-08 10:18:26
Argument deconstruction follows:
You attempt to portray Dotcom as a person who has committed a wrong bigger than these mafiosos.  In order to advance this point, you need a basis that you can use to compare the MAFIAA to Dotcom -- something that will allow you to *tacitly imply* that Dotcom is somehow a "worse" or more "reprehensible" person than the mafia we're criticizing here.
Thus, implicit in your argumentation, you embed the proposition (premise, really) that Dotcom somehow, mysteriously and inexplicably, has entered into an obligation to pay ("owes") artists similar to the obligation that the MAFIAA contractually acquired with artists.
This premise of yours easy to miss, because you don't actually come out and explicitly establish the yardstick you're using to compare Dotcom with the mafiosos.  You don't say "Well, Dotcom owes money to artists", because that would expose your argument to scrutiny and raise *valid* questions about the premise, such as "And how do you know that?".  No, of course not.  You just *leave the premise unsaid*, hoping for unwitting readers to "connect the dots" with suitable presuppositions which then pass under the radar and remain unchallenged.   How "nice" and "honest" of you.
Unfortunately for you, it did not escape me.  And, unfortunately for your argument, this implicit presupposition of yours is the key falsehood of your argument that falsifies the conclusion you're trying to imply (again, underhandedly so -- you don't really come out and say "Dotcom is scum, unlike the mafiosos who are merely less scum").
The observable reality that disproves your implicit and underhanded presupposition is quite simple: Dotcom has not acquired said obligation.  He provided a service to file uploaders, for which he got paid.  He fulfilled his contracts with his customers.  He is not responsible in any way for what the uploaders do.
Since reality and your presupposition are logically at odds, one must be true.  Last time I checked, reality always prevails over theory.  Reality talks, bullshit walks.
Solving for X: premise refuted =&gt; argument worthless.
Inb4 "assisting in copyright infringement" and similar bullshit: I know the criminals that conform the "justice" system claim Dotcom is a horrible "pirate" who eats babies for breakfast, and totally owes artists (by which they mean the MAFIAA) money.  I know they rationalize these defamatory claims using some crazy theory that they conveniently made up to excuse their violation of Dotcom's property and ruination done on behalf of the MAFIAA.
I'm not buying that corrupt nonsense.  It wouldn't be the first time that these depraved and malevolent individuals have concocted absurd legal theories (lied) for profit -- the earliest one I can think of right now, is inventing the theory that invisible entities called "corporations" are real.
The fact that they generally prevail in imposing their irrational theories over the rest of mankind isn't evidence that they're right -- it's only evidence of the extent sociopathy of these depraved people, that they need to distort reality *and violently punish* anyone who dares disbelieve their theories and act consistently with reality.  That's the only reason that they "prevail" -- because they control enough guns to kill, cage or ruin those who resist them.
So, if what you were going to allege in the defense of your broken argument, was something similar to "this piece of paper written by the aforementioned depraved people says that Dotcom owes $1 zillion dollars to artists", save it.

That isn't going to happen either -- I'm literally ten years over the fear of legal papers, like I'm twenty years over the fear of religious papers.  One conversation with a stranger on the Internet really isn't going to terrify me.
Are you trying to inform me that the pieces of paper are relevant to you?  Great, you've already told me that like three times, I don't need to be told again, cos I heard you the first time.
So what is it that you're trying to say, exactly?
Oh, and protip: if you're trying to persuade someone, telling him stuff like "it's ridiculous to think the way you think", or "I think your thoughts are shallow", or "you're using words wrong"... not very persuasive!

Yes, of course, doing what I suggested won't make these organized criminals believe that they aren't entitled to demanding money from you anymore. But it does prevent them from learning that you made money, therefore protecting you against becoming their target.
"Tax liability" is not a fact like "water is wet". It is a *"legal fact"*. Translation: it is merely an opinion that some people have (who profiteer from your work), written in some magical paper that many people choose to revere, like many people choose to revere the Bible.
Unfortunately -- and unlike most Bible believers in contemporary times -- cultists (generally wearing dresses or costumes) who write and revere these papers, are armed and fully prepared to ruin / cage / kill / maim any "heathen" who refuses to acknowledge or obey the orders in the papers. And their followers believe everything the cultists say, and hate those who refuse to share the cultists' doctrine.
This keeps almost everyone fully in the cult's grip, ripe for the predations of the cultists.

*They believe* that.  I don't.  Neither do you.  If we report, we only do because we're conscious that they'll terrorize us otherwise, not because there's any actual duty from our part.
Much of slicing through politics and being anchored to reality as opposed to the criminals' reframing of it, is about understanding and keeping very present the distinction between reality and fiction.  "Duty" is fiction with zero evidence to substantiate it.  Guns and rape cages are real.  We only need to play the bullies' pretend game for purely practical reasons, and only insofar as it prevents us from taking a bullet or a dick in a cage.  But we don't need to play their pretend game here, and we *certainly* don't have any obligation to believe it.

"Money laundering", let us all remember, simply means using your money peacefully without the permission of a group of sociopathic strangers.
So whether e-gold was a "money laundering scheme" or not, what they did was not wrong, yet they still were ruined by the sociopathic strangers.

Try it and you'll see.  Try not paying, go ahead.  Even if you don't drive it, you won't be allowed to sell it.
Ownership means being able to use things, sell them, rent them out, whatever peaceful thing you want to do with things, without having to ask anyone for permission or having to pay anything before exercising these rights.
As you can see, you can't exercise some of these rights if you don't pay the criminals.  According to the criminals, you don't really own your car.
But hey, I mean, if you really need more convincing, I can gladly show you the criminals stating in legalese that you don't really own anything, not even the shirt on your back.  Want me to?

"Regulation" is a process:
1. a group of people (the "regulators"),
2. ready and willing to use aggression against peaceful others (you and me) to get their way,
2. makes up orders ("laws"), written in complicated English ("legalese"),
4. oftentimes with built-in exceptions ("loopholes") to these orders for certain people ("lobbyists" and their customers)
3. makes up excuses ("reasons") to portray these orders (and the exceptions) as virtuous,
3. orders everyone else (you and me) to obey these orders,
4. has another group of people ("law enforcement") punish anyone who resists, neglects or forgets to obey the orders,
4. where these punishments escalate from "minor" (just theft) to "major" (kidnapping) to "ultimate" (execution), depending on how well you resist them,
5. and portrays these terrorist activities as virtuous as well.
In the issue of "regulating" Bitcoin, the idea is that Bitcoin users (all, or some class of them) can be threatened with punishment for disobeying orders that already exist, and can also be punished for disobeying any future orders these "regulators" might come up with.

(a) "the government" obtains land for roads against landowners' wills by threatening the landowners with (escalating) punishment if the landowners disobey their demands, and
(b) you seem to be in favor of that activity -- which I consider to be organized extortion, which to me is antisocial, and
(c) you vehemently insist that there is simply no way in which roads can be practically built unless the land is obtained through the extortion I mentioned in (a), then
I suppose I need:
1. proof that such an activity (a) is *not antisocial* and is *ethically okay* (in other words, proof that "not (b)" is true);
2. proof that claim (c) is true.  This proof must completely refute the construction and existence of private roads *before* governments monopolized road construction, which you claim is "practically impossible".
I'll wait for said proof here.
Yes, I understand it will be *a little bit difficult* for you to prove these things.  But, if you're convinced that your beliefs are correct *because* you reasoned them yourself, you should have no problem proving that which you insist is correct.


Oh, nonono.  That's not how it works.  I don't play that petty domination game of "I said X, now prove me wrong".

Why do you pretend like you missed the point, dude?
Everyone who downloads music now has to pay for a VPN or a seed box to not get railroaded. A large portion of the populace are recalcitrant felons. Those growing up today already have their ethics perverted by elementary+ school corporate propaganda telling them that downloaders are evil.
You tell me this hasn't scared millions off downloading music? That downloading will continue forever? No, man, downloading will die off with our generation, those who grew up knowing that "imaginary property rights" do not trump real property rights. And it won't come back until people cease believing in the collective delusion of "government" telling them that downloading is ~~evil~~criminal. Downloaders are the clandestine now, forever under threat of being ruined if they tell the wrong person.
Roads used to be private, and so was policing. Try asking anyone of the seven billion souls today, who have never lived before government expropriated and monopolized roads and policing from the peaceful people, ask if they can even conceive of the concept. They will all tell you that you are crazy for even daring to think about that.
That's the long-term effect of a law that prohibits a behavior -- people who grow up *not used to seeing the banned behavior*, naturally assume that anyone doing the behavior *must be evil*.
You are going to tell me that NerdfighterSean won't take the bot offline as soon as he perceives himself to be in danger? That blockchain won't eliminate the send shared feature when the terrorists in costumes show up at their door? That all these services will continue to be perceived as legitimate, as new generations grow up, unlike us, *not having ever known what it's like to actually have had economic freedom?*
These are real people being ruined here, their chances of succeeding at their bitcoin businesses **nil** unless they betray their customers. Would you use a coin mixer with the anti feature of tracking you down? Do you think they won't be intimidated into shutting down, as soon as their business becomes substantial enough to attract the crooks? The law has forever condemned ideas liki NerdfighterSean's to be relegated at the margins or destined to be outlaws. How can your argument be "meh, they'll never catch them"?
Tell you what: since you are so sure these services won't disappear, why don't you run one of them, and refuse to take it down when these criminals order you to, or intimidate you?

Second sentence second.  If you own any amount of any fungible wealth, what you do with it -- in terms of investments -- is going to be determined by what's *profitable* after risk is accounted for.  You provide *zero evidence* that in your timeline, all investment opportunities have dropped to 0% profitability, after risk is accounted for.

"Government doesnt define morality"?
That's, like, the primary function of these gangsters. Pushing people's moral buttons is exactly how they get to steal from everyone without resistance, and send millions to murder strangers and bomb children.
The people who claim to represent "Government" define morality **all the time**, they just call it "legality".
Different words, same concept and practical consequences: "whoever does something ~~immoral~~illegal, is a bad man, and must be punished". In other words: "government morality" (an oxymoron otherwise) is strictly defined as "obedience moral, disobedience immoral".
Of course, like all other false moral authorities in the history of Mankind, these fucks make magical exceptions for themselves. They can steal, you can't. They can order people murdered you can't. Corruption atop deceit.
Also, it's very important to realize that their moral opinions are backed by violence -- if you disobey them, they authorize themselves to terrorize you.
Thus, the people whom you unquestioningly and always obey "pass a law" decreeing "X is illegal". Whereas before it was perfectly legitimate to do X, suddenly all the people start judging people who do X as "bad", and it suddenly becomes okay for the gangsters to terrorize those who resist and continue doing X. That's supposed to be a *coincidence*? How is that *not* evidence of moral opinions being imposed by decree?
Don't believe me? Tell your loved ones or your boss you break the law and don't care about it, read their faces for signs of moral outrage. Or better yet, try to do one of the myriad things that is ~~immoral~~illegal for you the peasant to do, but perfectly ~~virtuous~~legal for them. Watch the ensuing moral condemnation as "government" transmogrify you from ~~pious~~"citizen" into ~~sinner~~"criminal".
Not feeling like trying this experiment? Ah, then you know in your bones how **heavy** morality dictated by "government" actually is, how it influences your **every thought and action** in ways you can't even consciously realize. Virtually every moral outrage these days is strictly tied to someone disobeying "government" orders. Exactly ike in the past it used to be immoral to disobey "God's" orders. Yes, in this sense, Godvernment is also exactly like God, regardless of your protestations.
Yet your faith in Godvernment is so **potent** that you can't bring yourself to accept this simple truth. Like the man who lights a cigarette while smultaneously denying that he smokes, *you cant even think* about this without careening into doublethink. Your very mind has been successfully enslaved by the biggest con in history.

You probably thought that with your shitty little insult there, you were going to intimidate me or shame me into believing your delusions, and shut me up, while shielding yourself from thinking about the uncomfortable truth.
What's ironic is your choice of insult.
According to you, I'm "crazy" because I refuse to play along with your delusional ideations, in which it's "righteous" to call other people "freeloaders" and it's "good" to bully and terrorize them, when they resist giving you what you want and doing as you say.
**NO.**  It's what *you* want to inflict on others that is *literally crazy*.  It is *you* who is being crazy when you mentally dissociate and pretend that what you want "isn't violent".  *You're* the crazy one here.

Ah, Mr. Smear Instead Of Argument shows up again.  Let's see what he has to say.


Why yes, yes I am free to move wherever I want :-).  Isn't that awesome, that these malefactors haven't yet decided to imprison me?  Any slave would say, I should be so grateful for that, right?  Should I say a prayer to the demigods that graciously endowed me with the lack of chains or passport refusals?
However... I don't *want* to move.  I want to change the place I am in -- specifically, I want the malefactors who rob me to stop robbing me-- so I don't have to move.  Failing that, I want to prevent them from robbing me and my family.  Bitcoin is perfect for that.
Do you have a problem with that?
If you do, perhaps *you* should move to, like, North Korea or Somaliland, both heavily "governed" territories.  I hear robbery by "government" there is fuly accepted by everyone.  You and your authoritarian "if you don't like it here, you can GIT OUT" tendencies would be at home there, Uncle Tom.
TLDR: no, YOU move, YOU are the one who sucks.
Also, you still haven't presented an argument -- just smears and demands that people get off "your" (not really your) lawn.

Yes, today that is the case, unfortunately.  This is coming from an ancap-to-the-max, so it might be perplexing that I agree with you.
What you explain tends to happen when you get 1000 people, most of which have been repeatedly **abused** and forced to do things against their will for decades.
The obvious consequence of such treatment, is that most of them end up growing up believing that there **must** be **someone** who is authorized to punish everyone else.
Why would they believe such a thing?  Because the alternative is for these people to **admit that they were abused** by their caretakers... which, as you might know from kidnap victims, battered wives, and sexually molested children, **is almost impossible to do**.
It won't be the case once the non-abused people are the majority.

"Bored with this conversation" *my ass*. You just wanna walk away now, because now you're too close to actually thinking about what is it you're willing to support, just to get your free shit and control freak plans for society. That's what's up here.
I'm not going to let you.
**Of course** you have advocated violence. Do you think I or others are too stupid to rub two brain cells together?
You have advocated that people (who you insult as "freeloaders" with zero basis) be forced to pay for certain things you want. How else, exactly, are you going to get your way, if not by violence against people who don't want to pay for your "free" shit? By asking pretty please?  Of course not.
Normally, I'd give you the standard 20 questions of "So how exactly will you force others to comply with what you want?" but this time I'll skip it, because I want to spare myself the 20 bullshit excuses you'll give me.  I'll tell you exactly what you'd *inevitably* admit to, *if* you had the necessary testicles to confront reality instead of weaseling out with insults and excuses.   Here's what you want, in plain terms of observable reality:
- You want to pretend out of the blue,
- that strangers owe you things,
- and you also want,
- a bunch of well-armed men,
- with immunity from their actions,
- to intimidate resistors in an escalating fashion,
- from threats to theft to assault,
- until the resistors either obey or die.
What happens to the people you want terrorized in reality, is that they get ruined / beaten / caged / put at risk of being raped in a cage / even killed if they resist effectively. *You know that*. Some of these things were done to Larken Rose, to Roger Ver. And you support what was done to them, so don't give me that bullshit of "I haven't advocated violence".
In the very fucking same sentence you deny then you affirm that you want other, peaceful human beings punished if they don't do what you want. This mealy-mouthed "I don't advocate for violence, but people who did not do anything to me should be punished" bullshit, which is a contradiction in terms, fuck that, it's too bad of a lie to even entertain. Fuck your doublespeak.
Worst of it all... The freeloader here is you, not the people who refuse to pay for the shit you want. You want others to be forced to pay, not for the things that they want (which they're perfectly willing to do) , but for the things that *you want for yourself*. You are the fucking freeloader, and you accuse *others* of being freeloaders? You have no shame.

Agreed.  Of course you can compare units of Bitcoin with units of any other commodity.  There is nothing wrong with doing that.  That's the very fucking point of money -- to compare how much shit's worth!  Saying "you can't compare" is *dumb*, because value comparisons are *inherently personal* (see: subjective theory of value).
The worst anyone can say is "I don't like that comparison", but personal preferences don't count.  All the people saying "but it's arbitrary", what they really mean is "I don't like that comparison".  Fine, come up with your own comparison, but don't go pooh-poohing other people's comparisons.

It is ironic that the same specious argument that was used against Bitcoin is being used against Litecoin here.

Mind you, it is a **very simple question** you must answer: when and how did Bernard von Nothaus deceive anyone as to the legal tender status of his product?  How can you prove that he "tried to mislead people into thinking Liberty Dollars were U.S. currency"?  **Why can't you answer those questions?**
Must I assume that you actually have zero evidence supporting your beliefs, and you're jerking me around?
Tell me: how do you plan to persuade me or anyone, if you can't actually prove what you say is true?  How, then, are you different from a common slanderer and liar?  I've followed the von Nothaus case for many years; *why should I believe you instead of my eyes?*

Upboated for valid question.
Inflation -- the mainstream non-Austrian definition -- is when an amount X of currency *tomorrow* buys *less* of any good than the same amount X of currency *today*.
Since you say "when it becomes important" it is safe to assume that you mean that an amount X of Bitcoin will buy *more* stuff in the futere than *today*.
Ergo, in your scenario, you do not describe inflation, but rather the opposite -- *deflation*.
Yes, we expect Bitcoin to *deflate* (which means "gain value in time, relative to goods and services").
We Bitcoiners furthermore consider that to be a *positive thing* for all involved with Bitcoin, for reasons beyond the scope of this simple comment.  The Bitcoin code base also shares our opinion in this matter, as you can imagine, because it is *deliberately engineered* to *produce* this outcome.

Where you say:


A natural monopolist is basically a monopolist that can only be out competed by an even larger monopolist, and who will steadily out compete any smaller competitors in the market. In practice this means that it will be a single giant corporation that will control the entire road network, that they will never face any competition, and as such can do whatever the hell they want. For monopolists, this means maximizing profits - and if you want to know why monopolistic profits are bad for consumers and society, then read this wikipedia article: 
There's two obvious answers to this:
1. You've successfully proven that some people believe some businesses can only ever be a monopoly.  I agree with that.  I don't agree with *them*.  I don't see how that's true.  In fact, my study of so-called "natural monopolies" has led me to conclude that the idea is entirely made-up pseudo-science to rationalize legalizing monopolies after the fact.
2. You propose (tacitly, of course) that monopolies are "bad" and therefore should be avoided.  Therefore, you propose (again, tacitly) that the "good" solution to that monopoly problem is to *grant a monopoly to a single group of people*.  Your argument is obviously absurd and I don't accept it.
Excuse me while I chuckle at your own false sense of rational superiority.

  What a strepitous failure of understanding of history and Latin itself.
Fiat means **by decree** (generally by someone with *auctoritas*, such as a person claiming to work for government, because otherwise the decree would be vacuous).  **Not by social convention**, which is the **opposite** of a decree.
Gold is an example of a currency that is *not fiat*, because it has value by *social convention* -- society finds it valuable *without any decree*.  So is Bitcoin.  **No one** has ever decreed that Bitcoin be valuable, and if the rulers of a hypothetical country should do that in the future, then Bitcoin would only be fiat currency *only for the people in that country who are ordered to use it as legal tender*, and nowhere else.
Of course, you ignore the historical and etymological facts here, because the school you went to probably never taught you this, and you never bothered to study history yourself.  Thus leaving you woefully unprepared to be fooled into confusing fiat currencies with non-fiat currencies, to the advantage of anyone who can exploit this ignorance in you for his self-serving purposes.

I believe what the author means is that fractional reserve banking cannot develop *within the Bitcoin system of transfers and the blockchain*.
Outside of it, of course it can. It is hard to imagine but *certainly plausible* that people might accept Bitcoin *substitutes* backed by fractional deposits. However, at that point, those substitutes are IOUs, not bitcoins themselves, so the fractional reserve system created in this way is *not Bitcoin itself*.

Then r3wt pointed out this: "i told him it was a bitch move to ban someoen who caught him in a lie"

This man is a *grownup*, yet *this* is his behavior.  The man lies twice, kicks people who disagrees with him, kicks people who point out that he lies, kicks people who point out his bitch moves.

This is, in my opinion, an attack on Bitcoin by way of attacking MtGox and Dwolla.
Ultimately tho -- and this must not be doubted by the "do you really think that a government would do that?  go on the Internet and tell lies?" weenies -- the goal is to sabotage Bitcoin and all its users, so that everyone can continue to be robbed through inflation.
That is the endgame, that is the goal. And if it takes putting a few million peaceful people who use Bitcoin as money in a cage, they *will* do it. If they don't, these sociopathic control freaks will be out of their jobs.  Their corn pone opinion will be that you must either use their funny money, or see the inside of a cage.

The connection between price and adoption is simple: given X supply, more adoption means higher price.
In practice, if Bitcoin went mainstream (substituting 50% of U.S. dollar transactions in the U.S., in my definition), there would need to be the equivalent of several billion to several trillion dollars' worth of Bitcoins to go around, just to represent all that staggering exchanged value.
This means a price per BTC anywhere between ten thousand and a hundred thousand dollars (not considering the depressing fact that U.S. dollars might have lost lots of their value as they are being ditched).  Each BTC must necessarily represent that amount of money for 50% of the U.S. economic activity to be carried out in Bitcoin.  And escalating demand will get us there, no doubt.
Take these numbers with a truckload of salt.

You can't be against drugs but in favor of the Drug War, because the Drug war is the very thing that makes drugs so profitable (and drug merchants so evil).
You can't say that you're in favor of a law but not in favor of its logical and observable consequences, because that would be Lalaland-level absurd, just as absurd as saying that you're for jumping off a tall building without a parachute but against dying when you hit the floor.

You're not going to convince me by citing some unsubstantiated opinion that you found on Wikipedia and that ignores historical fact.  So, wikipedia doesn't say it -- probably because there are a lot of people out there like you, who can't stand the fact that Hitler was empowered by democracy -- ***but the Enabling Act was within Hitler's democratically enumerated powers.***  That makes the Wikipedia quote you cited *pro-democracy selective reporting propaganda*.
Also *the fact that the vast majority of German people believed themselves to be in in democracy* ensured that pretty much everyone ***obeyed*** their democratically-elected ***authority***.  Um, what's the essential element for a mass murder?  ***Obedience to authority***.
What is the **common thread** in every Holocaust-sized mass murder?  ***Obedience to authority***.  What "reason" do people use to explain why they **obey the authority** of their democratically-elected leaders? ***Democracy***.
Tell me again, why are you denying the undeniable?
Like, I don't have a problem with democracy per se.  I have a problem with *people who believe that democracy grants authority that must be obeyed*.  I have a problem with people who say they believe this, then, when "authorities" allegedly empowered by democratic processes cause a catastrophic disaster, try to weasel out of accepting that democracy was the reason they obeyed those stupid and malevolent assholes.  ***You can't have it both ways.***

Teachers (at least U.S. public school ones) can do pretty much whatever the fuck they want, because they are part of a *protected class*, virtually *unfireable*.
As a general rule, unless there's video and the video shows blatant teacher behavior, whatever wrongdoings and injustices they perpetrate get swept under the rug or minimized.  *Even* in the worst cases (think child rape), sometimes it's *impossible* to fire a teacher or take away his retirement.
It's important for the people who run government that teachers be afforded this near-unlimited discretion and impunity, because that helps brainwash children into obedience and associate daring to think outside the box with hopelessness and dread.  Which is, after all, the ultimate goal of these internment camps we call "schools".
So, you can probably fight, lawyer up, spend months of angry efforts, and *maybe* you'll get the teacher's decision reversed... but you will **never** get him *fired*, which would be the just outcome for such whimsical and ignorant incompetence and malice.

Oh, don't worry.  That'll come in time.
Presumption of guilt develops organically, as the activity that induces presumption of guilt becomes the *exception* rather than the *norm*.
Look at it this way: get stopped with $20K cash or gold in your car, and the cops will almost certainly steal it, in what cannot be described as other than an act based on presumptive guilt.  This routinely happens now, and not only nobody bats an eyelash, but the majority of people instantly kneejerk with apologetics "it surely must be his fault, that guy must have been up to no good, *why does he need* to be carrying that amount of cash?".  Never mind the fact that you shouldn't need to explain yourself to anyone, you're just automatically assumed "guilty enough" to steal your shit (and brutalize / kill you, if you resist this theft on the spot).
*Why* does this happen now?  Well, because carrying large amounts of cash is no longer an activity that many people do, and when they do, they act like the little obedient tax cows they believe themselves to be, and report it to their masters.  When an activity that used to be normal becomes exceptional, it is *that much easier* for the rulers to tell obedient sheeple that they shouldn't be doing it, and to convince them that whoever does that activity is "evil".
Same thing may happen with Bitcoin.

Taking out a loan in dollars isn't enough to say you have shorted it.  To short it, you must buy something else with the loaned money, hold on to it, and then sell it back in the future to repay the loan.  You will have successfully shorted the dollar if you can pay the debt entirely with the proceeds of the future sale.

Let us just pretend for a second that Bitcoin pollutes more than nuclear bombs, and that cancer hasn't been cured strictly because so much money has been sunk into Bitcoin mining that literally no money is left for and spent in cancer research.
Now, with those assumptions in mind, let's assume that for whatever the reason, all existing Bitcoin miners *still choose* to continue mining Bitcoin.  Who knows why.  Perhaps they're irrational.

Well, I bet this man didn't own both a Betamax and a VHS simultaneously.
The reason everyone will converge on a single Bitcoin-like currency is simply because Bitcoin is a *network-effect good*, as explained by Jeffrey Tucker.  More people choose to take Bitcoin than they choose to take Litecoin, simply because they know that it's likelier others will then accept Bitcoin than Litecoin.
Whether the winner is Bitcoin or Nitcoin or Litcoin or Xcoin, or the technical merits of the thing is not relevant -- what's relevant is that the largest group wins.  That's why VHS "won the war", despite being technically very inferior to Betamax.
And, even if both Jeffrey Tucker and I are wrong about this... who cares?  Why should *we* fear competition in cryptocurrencies?  There's like 200 fiat currencies right now, and several precious metals... and they all coexist.  What exactly is the problem with that?  I'm questioning the unstated presumption that "there must be only one".


What he's saying here is that the U.S. dollar is "superior" to Bitcoin because there's a bunch of orders forcing everyone (in his U.S. centric crystal dome) to accept it.
He doesn't understand that voluntary currencies will beat that statist "advantage", just as they are beating it today.

Your assumption is absurd to me.
Person B has stated that he accepts *Bitcoin* as payment.  Why would person B accept "A stranger's promises to pay you Bitcoins at some time in the future" *in lieu of* actual Bitcoins?  The answer is *he wouldn't* -- he'd simply tell A **"no money, no sale"**.  And if B did, he was just *swindled*, because a "promise of Bitcoin" is *clearly not the same* as an actual Bitcoin.
If you came to me and you told me "I need your services, and in exchange I will pay you with a promise", I would tell you to go panhandle at Mission street.  I'm not a bank -- I am not in the business of giving you things of value in exchange for vague promises to repay me at some time in the future.  B is not a bank either, in your example.
What you suggest would never work.  I suppose what could work is that C lends *actual Bitcoins* to A, *in exchange for A's promise to repay with interest.*  Congratulations, C is a bank and you now have discovered *loans with interest*.  But *that's entirely C's business* -- no promissory notes float between A and B in this scenario.

That's a perfect comment!  Just in time to prove my point!


Here we have a perfect example of what it *means* to be *part of a government-protected class*: my interlocutor *automatically assumed that OP lied*.
There is zero reason to think that OP is lying, and in fact the story seems pretty credible, but my interlocutor has no problem immediately kneejerking to explain away the story by saying that "there's two sides of the story", and then baselessly *suggesting OP's side of the story must be a lie*.  *No facts whatsoever* to back that contention.  
The general rule is: when government-protected classes interact with non-government-protected classes, the government employee is assumed to be "in the right", and the person wronged by the employee just "must be wrong, or flat out lying".
Just one of the forms that government privilege takes.  Here's another one:


The wrongdoing is minimized by trying to diffuse the responsibility.
The situation here is actually very clearly black and white -- assuming OP is being truthful (reasonable assumption, given the upvotes and the consistency of what he's said) the teacher *wronged OP*.  No "maybes", no "perhaps there's a misunderstanding" -- the teacher simply *unjustly punished OP for writing something*.  Can't get any more "black and white" than that.
But my interlocutor immediately jumps to provide rationalizations to minimize the wrongdoing.  It's the same reflex unthinking that people who defend murderer cops' paid vacations exhibit.
And that's another form of government privilege.


And here we have, in black text over white background, an example of the belief that makes incompetent teachers are unfireable.  According to my interlocutor, it is "ridiculous" to fire a person who whimsically and ignorantly mistreats and punishes a kid he's in charge of ~~brainwashing~~educating.
Why is it "ridiculous" to fire an incompetent person who hurts children?  Who knows -- *the guy doesn't tell us*.  In the midst of this irrational pro-government-employee bias, we're left to assume it's the same "reason" why it would be "ridiculous" to fire murderer cops, so instead they get paid vacation.
In normal circumstances, I'd bring up the countless child rapist teachers who *haven't* been fired, but I doubt my interlocutor is listening to facts.  He's blinded by government doublethink.
The indoctrination doled out at his internment camp clearly worked on this man.

Your post is riddled with magical thinking to excuse utter corruption and malevolence.  I will single out two sentences to demonstrate this observation of mine.


If a portion of your Internet utility bill was used to bomb brown children, you would not dare say "It's childish and unrealistic to pay your bill and expect every portion of that money to be used to provide their service".  No.  What you would say is "fuck you ISP, I'm switching to another one, you won't see a single red cent from me anymore".
But, in the realm of government, suddenly that's supposed to be "acceptable" and anyone who dares point that malevolence out is somehow "childish" and "unrealistic".  It's a double-whammy of excusing malevolence and corruption while you insult the people who point it out.
You're doing exactly the same magical exception thing that religionists do when they see pedophile priests and look the other way, and they see the Pope living a lavish lifestyle while many people are starving.


This is good old political creationism, that is, the notion that only Godvernment can do a certain particular thing.
We also see this in the realm of religionists when they exclaim "Well, DUH, only God could have possibly made roses and rivers, without God you wouldn't be standing there".
Politics is just another form of dogma covering up a malevolent belief system.  I'm sorry to say, but you're the victim of a cult.  When you're ready to step out of that cult, I'll be here to help you, no commitments.

I know that you meant that, but that's not the outcome of this move.  This situation fucks with all of us by generating an uncertain legal climate (translation into people-doing-things language: *terrorizing people who use Bitcoin peacefully*).


**This is baseless.  There is no case law** that needs to be established for me to use my bitcoins (lowercase, btw) legally in California today.  I do it every time I want it, and it's perfectly legal.  No extra law, statutory or precedential, needs to be established, for me to do that.  Court cases just throw the existing legal framework into uncertainty.
Note that I'm being kind here by responding to what you said assuming that it's a valud argument.  It isn't.  I'm here giving your stated argument the benefit of **relevancy**.  But in reality, it's not relevant, at the very least (but not restricted) to me.  In five years:
1. I won't be "bound by the law" of California.  Many other people won't be as well.  I shouldn't give a shit, but I do and I speak up, *for the benefit of people like you*.
2. The cultists in black dresses will decide whatever they feel supports their criminal organization.  If they decide that the men they're seeing in front of them are threatening their paycheck, they will decide to cage or kill them.  Simple as that.  So...
3. ...you will either decide to stop using Bitcoin altogether, or use Bitcoin in a way that doesn't afford them detection such that they can ruin your life.
I close here with the most important observation of all, at least in my mind:
 is never favorable to anyone when peaceful people are ordered to stop their activities or else face being caged.  Never.  Ever.  If you think that risking human beings thrown in a cage, and/or children being left destitute at the hands of "the State", is worth the phyrric victory of doing what you want "under color of law", you are betraying that which you stand for, and you will face the same thing sooner or later.

The lamestream media is already picking up on the reality of how resilient Bitcoin is.  The ONLY reason prices went down is that the exchange oligopolists took over AN HOUR to process newly-filed purchase orders, plus more than several hours for those who needed to feed their exchange accounts with, you guessed it, filthy fiat.
Once again statism is the belief system that prevents markets from being efficient.  It prevents fiat money from flowing into Bitcoin fast.  It prevents new exchanges from forming and competing.  Statism is the ultimate unintended consequence engine.

Value is not a property of a thing, but rather a relation between the person and the thing.  How valuable a thing is to someone depends on many circumstantial factors that alter the relation with the thing and thus the perception of that someone about the thing. Thus,  for every thing,  there are as many values as there are people *evaluating* the thing at any point in time. 
In this sense the value of a thing is very similar to a song rating - - for the same song,  there is no one rating but rather as many ratings as there are listeners of that song multiplied by every moment in time.

Bitcoin can only "lose the war" if, at the time that governments start threatening to ruin the general public for using Bitcoin, the general public *obeys*.  Then, of course, only "outlaws" (people who go their own way and don't care about obedience) would use Bitcoin.  In other words, "losing the war" means Bitcoin goes exclusively black-market.
[But, if the people won't obey, the words of the crooks won't matter.](  If even **10%** of you continue to use Bitcoin, continue to transact in Bitcoin, continue to accept Bitcoin, *regardless of what the racketeers tell you*, then the racketeers can't get you all.  And they'll give up.

I can't debate with a person who is willing to have me held at gunpoint or thrown in a cage for disagreeing.

Actually, fiat and unbacked are not synonymous -- they are vaguely related by happenstance, like humans and de-feathered chickens are both [featherless bipeds]( (my buddy Plato made that one up).
Here is the most prominent example of how the two are not synonymous: when the Roman empire had gold coins be legal tender, gold coins were *both* fiat *and* backed by the metal's own utility and scarcity.

This is part of the propaganda mythology surrounding democracy -- the idea that votes matter and effect change by changing the people who have the power to cage / ruin / kill those who disobey "laws".
The reality is that **corrupt and malevolent people** have enormous incentive, and since they tend to be very good at deceiving people, this ensures that a large contingent of corrupt and malevolent people have **permanent power** with which they can order you around.
In addition to that, voting does not change the *bureaucrats and enforcers*, so regardless of who is at the top, **a large contingent of corruption, malevolence and violence remains unchanged**.


Ah, yes, the eternal seductive offer to have power over your fellow man.  The idea is that people can be bribed into accepting the system by offering them to be a part of the system.  It's a major innovation in systems of human farming.
Unfortunately, this offer is bullshit too.  For most positions of power over others that carry any meaningful power, **you need to be well-politicaly connected and also very rich** to even opt for those positions.  And people who don't **toe the line** of the established powers, often get sabotaged so they never get any power.
So **this belief is just a fraudulent fantasy as well.**
Idea vs. reality.  Contrasting them is how I know what you believe isn't real.

Not a problem.
In what follows I am making the sensible assumption that you're being convicted because they *imagined*  (correctly, but they have no proof) that you have a lot of money but ain't talking.
So, after being convicted (essentially, of refusing to be robbed by playing dumb), you'd be pretty convinced that these people only care about you as a tax cow they can milk dry.  Therefore, I would imagine you'd get the fuck out of that piece of shit place that fucked with your life so malevolently.  Plus, there are better places to be at, when you have money.  And you won't find a job in the place you're at, because criminal record.
So, as soon as you are released, you just GTFO to a place that has no extradition, and you're golden.  You live like a king with one tenth of the expenses you would have made in whatever place fucked with your life.  You can find a job or invest your money.  You can spend everything you want, and not have to care about being treated like a criminal anymore.  Presto!
In other words: you give these terrorists the finger but never your money.
Trust me: there is a **huge** difference between "in jail and waiting to be released only to live in total destitution" and "in jail, but waiting to be released to spend your money in a tropical paradise".

When, exactly, did Bernard imply or state there that Liberty Dollars were legal tender (which is the claim in question)?
Ah, that's right, you can't prove that because **he doesn't ever do that**. All you're accusing him of is having a flashy product, that the cashier may take, but still is not obligated to.
You're trying to pass off a simple and truthful human interaction as evidence of wrongdoing. He says "look at this nice coin" and you enter witch hunt mode "aaaaah, see?  that's where he tries to deceive people!  undeniable!". Exactly **how** is what he does in the video "deceptive"? **You don't explain**.
You don't explain because you **can't**. You expect people to say "ahhh, there is video of him committing fraud" and take your **inexplicably erroneous, sarcastic and dishonest interpretation** of the video at face value.  You expect people here to not see the video -- **showing an ordinary person demonstrating a coin to another ordinary person, who ultimately finds it flashy and valuable** -- and just infer from your scaremongering that he is "committing some sort of maleficence".  He's actually *upfront* about the fact that he has something called "silver dollar", frankness which you somehow, mysteriously, reinterpret into a stab at deceit.
You use sarcasm and resort to scaremongering because you have nothing against von Nothaus -- **the video you share**, contrary to your claims, **doesn't actually show any deception**, and that's why you have to pad the video with **FUD**.  Such as this mixture of facts and sarcasm:


...where you telegraph to your reader that *merely informing people they have a choice* appears to be a "despicable act of obvious fraud", and don't we all agree that it's so good this malevolent person is now in a cage like an animal.
 *Meanwhile*, the person in the video who took the coin has made **six times** the money, as spot silver prices rose to $30.  But this is, according to you, an "act of fraud" which just *must* be punished.  You're far too obsessed with your evidence-free witch hunt to see how the person you call "duped" benefited from their choice.
This is what matters: The statement that "Liberty Dollar attempted to deceive people into believing that Liberty Dollar was legal tender" is still unproven, and you have no evidence to back it up.
And now I also know that you see reality and distort it to "find evidence" for the beliefs you were told you must believe. Cos you were told by "the government" you infinitely trust that von Nothaus is a "bad man", so von Nothaus showing a coin to someone must surely be "evidence of malevolent fraud".  That is, that you are irrational, and that you'll believe anything your government will tell you, even to the point that you will disbelieve your own eyes.  I am also not surprised at your level of dishonesty.  And now we know for sure that you're an asshole too.
I'm not trying to persuade you.  I'm just showing everyone else how much of an asshole and a liar you are.  I think that people deserve to know that for their own benefit and protection.  That's why I took the time to write this reply.

*Correction*: every single person I love, is anarcho-capitalist.  I know and I have talked to more ancaps in the past year than I have talked to people like you, who are still in the Matrix, desperately grasping at your feeding straws.
Here's some information on us, for your personal benefit:
Ancaps are a very reserved lot, *precisely because* cultists like you immediately turn into **bullies** when one of your dogmas is challenged.  But we get together, we talk, we have drinks, we laugh at your confusion with the world, we marvel at your futile attempts to explain away and fix statist disasters with "more epicycles", and we break as many laws as we can get away with, as long as it's within our ethical norms.  Much like gay people a few decades ago, or Nazi detractors before WW2, we just *choose* to *avoid bullying* for the most part, which means avoiding the Staazis like you, far too indoctrinated to even *reason* about elementary logical consistency inquiries like "why is a group of people allowed to legally rob everyone else?".
Now you know why you feel -- incorrectly -- that "nobody is buying" very simple ideas based on voluntary interactions.  They are, quietly -- they're just not telling you, because you *can't take* the truth.  Ask yourself: why do you think that marijuana is being decriminalized and gay marriage is now being permitted?  It's precisely the simple idea that consensual interactions are legitimate and it's malevolent to punish them.  Who, do you think, conceived *that*?
*We're not alone, and we are more than you think*.  I'm just letting you know, so you don't get the wrong idea.  You might want to factor this new knowledge into your daily life, lest you offend someone important, who perhaps won't say anything to your face, but will definitely cost you opportunities in life.  For example, I myself am not rich, I only make six figures a year, but if I heard you talk about ancaps like you do -- and I interview people here -- you would *not* get a job where I work... and you would *never know why*.

"Regulation" is an euphemism that sounds nice, but actually means organized terrorism against people who disobey, while blaming their victims.  The way it works is as follows:
If you disobey their orders, they first send you threatening letters.  If you don't respond and obey, then they fine you, declaring themselves the "owners" of some of your stuff, and forcing others to give up your money.  If you resist this, more of the same happens.  If you resist that, eventually, a bunch of armed men come to drag you into a cage so they can later parade you in front of a person in a black robe.  If you resist that, they'll brutalize you.  If you resist that effectively enough, they'll just kill you.
That is what "regulation" is, in terms of people doing things.
Obviously, there is no way to "regulate" anything without being fully prepared to ruin anyone who disobeys your orders.

Yes, absolutely, **but rituals don't magically change nature or ethics**.  If you follow a ritual to sanctify a piece of paper that says "Pedro Suarez et al are now allowed to rob everyone, and kill or cage whoever resists", that doesn't mean Pedro is ethically justified in robbing anyone.  That's the irrationality behind "Rule of Law", no different from the irrationality that magical words and talismans turn bread into human flesh.

**[EXPANDED VERSION, READ IT](
Think about the **machiavellian brilliance** of this plan from the criminals of government ([yes, it is a government plan]( falsely passed off as a "voluntary venture").
They cannot ban Bitcoin outright.  They cannot let it operate freely.  They cannot effectively regulate it.
So what do they do?  They electronically divide ***us*** into nice and tidy piles of "dirty" and "clean", getting us to **attack each other** and generating a black market to "wash" perfectly good and usable coins.
But they don't do it directly, no.  It would be too obvious.  They get **unscrupulous sellouts** to do the dirty work for them.  And then they pass it off as a "voluntary scheme".
At the beginning this racket will be optional.  *At the beginning*.  You know, to give people a chance to choose their sides and cultivate hate against the other side.  Then, the moment you least expect it, if you chose the "wrong" side, you will be effectively broke.  And you may very well be caged too, under the pretense of you having "attempted to launder illegal money" (or "invalid" coins, if you prefer).
Have you ever seen an antisocial plan so malevolently orchestrated to blindside and hurt so many decent people financially?
Now you have.

No, I don't really want to have a discussion with you.  I only wanted to point out the fact that people with your mentality are dividing the community by getting them to worship and grovel to sociopaths, and hate or fear those who don't.  Whether you believe that's the case or not, I don't give a shit.  I did what I came here to do, and that's enough for me.
I'm simply not going to debate with a person who thinks it's right that disobeying these sociopaths must be punished, and that the way to "solve" this abomination is to bribe or grovel to these sociopaths for favors.  That belief is **fucking bonkers and malevolent**, and if you openly advocated the same of any other Mafia, people would be trying to get you committed or would call you a pathetic coward rat.  So I won't pretend to have a debate about such an indefensible belief, because it's not a debate at all.

It doesn't matter what *we think* is "good for the economy" or not.  Our opinions are *opinions*, and like assholes, they're full of shit.  What matters is that you have a choice -- and, of course, that no one threatens or punishes you for your choice -- so you can be happy.
For example, today you can choose between:
- Bitcoin (which will be deflationary at some unspecified point in the future), and
- Freicoin (which has built-in demurrage and, as such, behaves equivalently to an inflationary currency)
Both 'coins embody different *opinions* of how money should behave.  According to your stated opinion, you would choose Freicoin as your preferred 'coin.  Or perhaps you choose to stay with dollars.
I respect that choice of yours.  I would never in my wildest dreams even conceive of punishing you for choosing to use Freicoin, say by taking your house away, or putting you in jail, or killing you, if you resisted me and chose to use Freicoin anyway.
I, on the other hand, prefer Bitcoin.
Knowing that, the **real** question is raised: do you respect **my** choice to use Bitcoin like I respect your choice to use Freicoin or dollars?
If I can use Bitcoin and you can use Freicoin or dollars, we are both happy, because we both got what we wanted.  Don't you agree?

They don't do that because you **obey, snitch on yourself, and surrender your money**. If you resisted they would absolutely  send armed men to your house, and if you resisted them, you would be executed. On the spot.
You tell yourself otherwise and play pin the sarcasm on the comment to play it off like it's nothing, but you pay anyway. Because you know very well what will happen to you if you don't surrender your stuff.
Other robbers are generally nice like that too -- if you hand over the car keys without making a fuss, they don't shoot you in the face.

Pffft. You haven't understood what governments do, at all.
Sure they could just round up every bitcoiner and shoot them, but they cannot get away with that because then they are perceived as common criminals and eventually people start shooting back. 
Which it why government needs to make up a **sin**, to find an **excuse** to assault you or ruin you.  Once they have done that. They have a plausible,  believable "reason"  to ruin anyone who commits that "sin". They can ruin you and then turn around and tell everyone "well,  he did this,  he is a sinner, therefore our assault is just and virtuous". 
In this case, the "sin" is financial privacy, the enabler is coin fungibility, and the excuse they can use to assault the "sinners" is coin tainting. 
This is why it is **of the utmost importance to push back against the sin and to discredit the excuse**. 
Co's, if we don't do that, then when the new sin has been instituted and the excuse implemented, it will become the new normal when people get their coins robbed by government after they attempt some semblance of financial privacy using bitcoins.  Yes, you will turn around and scoff at your fellow Bitcoiners (now outlaws), and blame them for whatever the authorities do to them.

Their implementation is technically feasible without even a soft fork. They plan to use it such that they can use some coins to track stock ownership directly in the block chain.

In markets like MtGox, people post trade orders like "I am willing to sell 10 bitcoin at 30.5 dollars (but no less)" or "I am willing to buy 5 bitcoin at 29.5 dollars (but no more)".
When you post your order, the marketplace (MtGox) matches up your order with the best possible price you can get out of all the other offers that might fulfill yours, and takes a small percentage for this service. If it can't, then it places your order on hold until it can be fulfilled.
The last price (price of the last transaction) goes up or down depending strictly on the prices people are willing to sell or buy at (the price where sellers and buyers meet, and the marketplace fulfills / clears orders). The ask price is the lowest price of all orders selling bitcoins. The bid price is the highest price of all orders buying bitcoins.

I can see how that makes sense.  If everything you have can be stolen just because a Mob says so, then those things will necessarily be *less valuable* because there is a *risk* attached to them.
Bitcoin, however, is an exception to that... *when it is stored in a brainwallet*, of course.
@_date: 2013-05-30 19:21:46
I disagree.
One of the ways in which people doing business as "government" tax (steal from) people is inflation (devaluing the currency by printing more of it, so repayment of their debt is cheaper than the money they borrowed in the first place).
Think about it: every large expenditure that these people make comes from borrowed money.  Every campaign of mass murder they have initiated (you probably call them "wars") has been financed with said borrowed money.
So, you bet your ass *that they do care*, when this insidious hidden source of trillions of loot is affected by people using a currency they cannot sabotage / devalue.
Just you wait,  You'll see how -- even after every avenue to enter Bitcoin anonymously and protect yourself from their organized theft has been quashed through their terror -- they will still care to sabotage Bitcoin.  That'll be your confirmation.

...it is *clear* that he disobeyed this order (emphasis on the bolded text).  You will get no argument from me there.
**But that is still not evidence that he "tried to mislead people into thinking it was US currency".** He was convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. § 486, which does not mention anywhere "misleading people into thinking defendant's product is US currency".  That does not confirm he "tried to mislead people into thinking it was US currency".   It is **deceitful** on your part to try and pass his punishment off as if it confirmed your claim.
If I ask you for evidence that he "tried to mislead people into thinking it was US currency", his legal conviction is **not evidence** that supports that.  The similarity of his coins -- a matter of *opinion* -- is **not evidence** either.

I am afraid this is likely how it'll go.  When organized criminals want to get you, they have no problem ignoring or trampling on whatever they've said / promised / written in the past.
In other words: if a cultist in a black robe is dead-set on fucking with you, because he perceives that what you do threatens his appearance of legitimacy and his organization's little monetary racket, he can just (as many in the past have) decides that the meaning of any of those words strictly defined in the law, "don't actually mean that".

Well, I don't agree with you.  I think the idea that people should change the world by groveling to politicians and legitimizing their malevolent activities, has in fact caused much, much damage to the world; damage that could have been avoided.  
Think about it: Adolf Hitler came into power *because* of that idea.  The six million Jews he ordered murdered were *legally murdered*.  If an idea is an *integral sine qua non part* of getting to a mass murder like that, then there is for sure a way we can say that said idea is toxic and stops progress from happening.
Anyway, you don't have to agree with me, but I definitely long for a world where people don't think that empowering psychopaths through rituals is "good".

Answer my question. You said that a group of people who enjoy a territorial monopoly of aggression is necessary to prevent monopolies from forming. 
You therefore tacitly propose that monopolies are bad and preventing monopolies is good, yet simultaneously you propose that the monopoly of aggression is good and must be protected / kept / obeyed.
This is **absurd**.
Either (ao you believe that all monopolies are bad and you are therefore proposing a bad, or (b) you believe that only *one* magical monopoly is good for irrational reasons you leave unstated.

People are "idiots" about bitcoin precisely because they *get it*: they instantly get the implications of a pseudonymous, easy-to-transfer, easy-to-hide, hard-limited currency.
People aren't fools. They intuitively get the implications for Bitcoin, and they are profoundly terrified because it means the end of everything they were trained to need for feeling safe -- the end of currency monopolies,the end of banking middlemen, the end of authoritarianism, quite possibly the end of government as it is conceived today.
Bitcoin means change, of the fundamental and unavoidable kind. Bitcoin means they have to reflect, "Butbutbut what about the ever-hyped 'threat' of two strangers somewhere peacefully agreeing to exchange stuff I don't like? How will these 'bad' people be terrorized into behaving how I want them to behave?"
So... When people are being "idiots" about bitcoin, they aren't telling you what they ignore -- they are telling you about what they want and what they fear. What they are really saying is *"I don't want Bitcoin to be"*.
And if you don't believe me, try asking them this: "imagine I invented and marketed a device that, like a force field, allows anyone to make themselves or their things invulnerable to assault and theft -- what would happen then?". (Note how the closest thing to said device is, in fact, carrying a gun, and how pretty much everyone believes that only a certain privileged caste with costumes should be allowed to have them) Now, after you have asked them that question, take note of their emotional reaction to that. and the similitudes of that reaction to them being "idiots" about Bitcoin.

That's right.  This level of centralized control is *engineered* into the protocol.  This makes Ripple as safe from the authorities as putting your money in a bank account.  Which... well, if you use Bitcoin, you understand why that's bad.
Ripple could be the best thing ever, a cancer-curing, money-ejaculating, chocolate-flavored penis.

I envision the same thing from a currency called "Governmentcoin".


I don't think so.
**Nobody** will **ever** voluntarily choose a currency that automatically steals *40% of what one deposits in one's wallet*, much less if the loot goes to a *bunch of cocksuckers hated and distrusted by 9 out of 10 people polled*.
This makes the chances of any Governmentcoin to give Bitcoin "a run for the money" nil.  Unless, of course, everyone is threatened with ruin and violence to force them to use Governmentcoin, *nobody will use it*.
And, if everyone is threatened, then by definition we can say that Governmentcoin did *not* give Bitcoin a "run for the money", since it took **massive aggression** for reluctant people to use it.  We only use the idiom "X gave Y a run for their money" if people overwhelmingly chose X over Y... but not if people were *forced* to use X against their choice.
This hypothetical aggression may still be in the cards, but as far as your particular statement goes, it stands refuted in my view.

I like [how the article]( writer takes great pains to avoid mentioning the fact that the Indian-American victim was **robbed**.  I like how he quotes without questioning -- therefore reinforcing the view of -- the officer saying "currency violation", as if it was "wrong" to peacefully do with your money as you please.  It's like he went on a mission to find every euphemism to obscure the very obvious **gun in the room**.
I've written about this in the past, and yes indeed, this is **one of the most important properties** of Bitcoin.
See, today, if you get punished for a bullshit made-up victimless ~~sin~~crime, you can be sure that pretty much everything you own is going to be gone one way or another, because the thugs that punished you will essentially steal it all, sometimes even preemptively.  They're just going to issue an ~~enchantment~~decree declaring everything yours is now theirs, and that which they leave will be impounded, towed, squatted, held or pilfered by others.  Without access to your money, you can't even mount a defense against the criminals.  Checkmate, victim, you're fucked.
In other words: their victims are guaranteed to be 100% broke and 105% workplace pariahs after being punished.  These facts provide the crooks with a huge leverage against their extortion victims, sort of a perverse "incentive" to surrender their legitimately acquired things in exchange for "leniency" from the terrorists (commonly called "a plea").  I mean, you're gonna lose it all, regardless of whether you do time or not, so might as well just fund the terrorists ruining your life, and get less terrorism in exchange.  Pound of flesh and all.
But, with Bitcoin, it doesn't have to be like that *at all*.  Put most of your savings in a brainwallet, or some other form of digital storage whose whereabouts only *you* know.  Now they're safe, completely immune from these malevolent crooks, who wouldn't be able to spend them even if they gained possession of the digital storage device.  You're *not* immune, but the fruits of your labor *are*.  That which you worked for, that which made you into the man they're trying to destroy, is entirely safe from them.
That changes the equation, massively.  You do time, perhaps a couple of years.  They give you free food, you get to exercise, you read books and teach yourself another college degree.  Then, when you get out, you have perhaps no possessions but certainly all your money available to you.  You move away / escape / flee / emigrate, possibly to a tropical paradise where everything's cheap.  *And you still have your money.*
Sure, maybe you don't have your previous material possessions, and maybe your wife is fucking another man by now, but at least you can *start over* with more than just the shirt on your back.  Start a business, find a missus, put some food on your table, not have to worry about the big fat Voleuse tattoo that the State burned on your forehead with its "criminal records" human degradation.  Essentially, you get to leave the system that attempted to extort obedience and your work out of you.  With Bitcoin, you get *the most fundamental right of them all*: *the right to quit*.
Given the prospect of living a dignified life after being railroaded by these organized criminals, *who, of the many people who today take pleas under duress, wouldn't take this opportunity*?
People let themselves be robbed *when they have no choice but to comply*.  Bitcoin **changes that**.

Yes, correct, but you have to pay in market value of the commodity as of today's prices.

Bah.  You don't even **define** what "good currency" is supposed to mean, yet you present this flimsy non-argument that is allegedly supposed to prove that Bitcoin is "not a good currency".
You know what a "good currency" is, for me, and for every other Bitcoiner?  In plain English of people doing things?  It's this:
- I can buy it.  *Check*.
- I can sell it.  *Check*.
- I can buy shit with it.  *Check*.
- I can sell shit for it.  *Check*.
- It's hard to steal (impossible unless the password is stolen).  *Check*.
- If I choose not to spend it today, its value is not gonna be sabotaged by strangers with a printing press who can run the press at their will.  *Check*.
Bitcoin covers **every single aspect** of a "good currency" as defined above.  This is why we fucking own Bitcoin.  You may not like these properties, but that doesn't mean it's "not a good currency".  It just means you're losing the opportunity of benefiting, like we do.
How about a little intellectual honesty, enough to provide **truthful, useful knowledge** to people who read you?  Is that too hard?  Start by dumping any and all theories that, when confronted with reality, fail.  That's a good start.

You don't see it?
As the number of people selling Bitcoin on the street dwindles to a trickle -- because of the MSB registration order and the inevitable fears that these people will be accused of a crime -- and you find yourself out of choices *but* for the exchanges, your future purchases will become much more traceable.
Eventually, a point will come when your off-exchange purchases, or unexplained wallet balance variations, will automatically be suspect and grounds for an investigation on you.  Just like it is today for dollar balances and purchases.  And once you're indicted, guilty or not, [you're fucked](
I'm surprised that you haven't deduced this on your own.  They did this very thing to bearer bonds, and now they are simply illegal.  Expecting that this won't happen to Bitcoin is like expecting a mafioso not to break your legs for resisting demands of protection money.

First, literally, you're incorrect.  The coins, like numbers, don't exist to begin with.  They are abstract.  The term "to exist" means to have a shape and a location within the Universe (don't ask me if you don't trust me, ask a physicist, I don't make up words, I just use them as correctly as I humanly can).  Exactly what shape are your Bitcoins and where are they located?  Can't answer that?  Then you must accept the obvious truth.
Second, from the standpoint of mathematics, these specific lost coins are *as good as gone* from the system you claim to know.  This reduction in potential supply causes deflation -- exactly the same effect on the economy as locking up the equivalent portion of paper bills behind an inviolable vault and throwing away the key.
Coins that cannot be accessed, cannot be spent.  *Not even in theory.*  If you don't understand this, you don't understand Bitcoin *or* cryptography, and you should not be disinforming others with falsehoods.
Thus, losing coins acts as a *donation of perceived value* to everyone else who has coins.

It's like a zombie religion. Anyone who refuses to believe in the omnibenevolence of the criminal gang running the scam is told "GTFO" and "you are evil and want us all to be miserable". Compared to Christians or Muslims, at least they don't say I should be thrown out of my own home, just because I refuse to obey their priests or give them money. Then again, they are similar: when their God orders someone murdered, then it is "not murder" and the victim is to blame. Sodom and Gomorrah or the Holocaust -- is really the same thing provoked by belief in authority.

'Course they do.  Why do you think people loved Pablo Escobar so much?
The fact that the thieves give you back some of the crumbs they stole from you, doesn't make them "not thieves".  There isn't a magical exception from the category of "thief" for people who bribe you with stolen loot.
In fact... You might be confusing you being farmed like an animal with generosity.  The farmer gives health care and food to his cows.  Does that mean that the farmer considers the cows equals?
No, of course not.  It just means the farmer wants to grope their tits to get their milk, and he won't hesitate to slaughter a few of them to get their meat, or when they are out of line.
Don't believe me?  Here's some practical experiments.  Try being "out of line" in front of a "government authority", see how fast they ruin you, break your bones, cage you, or kill you.  Try not giving them your milk or refusing to become cannon meat, and you'll discover how much of their "generosity" is just you being conned into cooperating with your captors.

Paging [Mike Gogulski](He's gonna enjoy this.  Okay, let me see if I understand your theory of rights.
You're saying that a person "gains the rights" not to be murdered, not to be brutalized, not to be robbed, not to be forced to do work, *through the magical blessing of "citizenship"*.
In other words, you're saying that any person who is *not* a citizen of anywhere, **has no rights**.  In other words: since he has no rights, it's perfectly legitimate to steal from, pummel, kill him.
***Excellent!***  By sharing with us your Original Sin Theory of Rights -- according to which one must be Saved from Hell by surrendering himself to a State in exchange for Citizenship -- you just managed to **prove** what OP was just sharing with us: citizenship is, indeed, a form of discrimination.  
Just so you know, the Nazi regime used this exact theory to legally terrorize, rob and massacre Jews.  The Nazis "stripped them of their citizenships" (basically a legal pronouncement that has approximately the same effect on reality as a magic spell).  Then they proceeded to claim that, since they were not citizens, they had no rights, so they could do whatever the fuck they wanted to them.  They robbed, they terrorized, and they murdered them.
That's right, my friend, your theory isn't just abominable, odious discrimination from Legal Land that only shitty bigots would seriously believe -- it also just happens to **literally sanction** the Nazi atrocities.
Now, I'm not exactly an expert on every socioethical theory ever... but if the *conclusion* of your socioethical theory is that what the Nazis did is legitimate... well, let's just say I don't need Socrates sitting next to me, to know that you indisputably must have taken a *wrong fucking turn* somewhere in your premises.
As for my personal opinion, I think you haven't thought at all any of the slave mentality "rights are privileges granted by legal presumption / pronouncement" nonsense you're saying.

You withdraw cash to buy weed, the weed seller gets busted, they check out his dolla bills yo, rest assured that shit will get tracked right back to you -- and from that point, it's just a matter of terrorizing you until you incriminate yourself.

Ah, so, what I said.  "Criminal is whoever we gangsters in government say is criminal".
It's super convenient to arbitrarily define a denigrating word by definitionally exempting the most sociopathic and dangerous members of society right off the bat.  "It's not a crime when we kill / maim / kidnap / ruin, says so right here in these papers we wrote".  I'd buy that for a dollar!
Yeah, in case it wasn't obvious before, that's not the definition of "criminal" I'm using.  I don't magically exempt people from social norms just because they are members of an organization. 
So, if, in the past, you have had trouble understanding what I'm saying when I talk about the criminals d.b.a "government", please make sure to take this into consideration when interpreting what I am saying.  When I say "criminal", I mean *criminal*, not "person whom the top criminals call 'criminal' but is really just disobedient".

@_date: 2013-12-02 11:11:41
Most of the people who congregate there subscribe to a popular cult(ure) of certain economics cultural dogmas / memes (Keynesianist shit in particular)
The very existence and success of Bitcoin completely obliterates most of these memes.
Keynesianism being a cult instead of actual science / philosophy, its adherents *must* do what cultists do: they abandon intellectual honesty through doublethink, whenever they face ideas that make them question the cult itself.
Of course, the standard self-manipulative ways to protect oneself from new ideas are:
- deliberately distorting elements of reality to suppress knowledge of the ideas,
- attacking ideas and their proponents instead of refuting arguments.
It is often the case that cultural memes die only when their proponents die, as most people refuse to accept new ideas if they conflict with the ideas out of which they've formed their own identities.

Yeah, for sure. That was a fun debate to watch. And the repercussions, even more entertaining.
I don't doubt stef's integrity, but we can tell he's softballing. Perhaps it is a simple strategy that lets us all see the contradictions and faulty reasoning of Peter Schiff.
It was very hard to stomach, for me, when I heard Peter speak of "Hong Kong bank where you can go and redeem your private notes in gold". What the fuck was the man even talking about... You redeem your gold and what then? You shove them barz up your ass before boarding the return plane? What planet does he live in?  You board a plane with ten or more coins, and you better snitch on yourself or else you're fucked.
And does he not know that of the last three companies who tried what he proposed, e-gold, liberty reserve, and nothaus, all of the founders are sitting in a cage?
I mean for Christ's sake, Peter's own father Irwin (a good man) is rotting in a cage right now, ruined by the very people who won't allow Peter's scenario to realize. Does he not understand that his ideal proposed scenario is way, way further than Xanadu? How is he disconnected from the reality that the goonvernments won't let it happen, ever?

The safest is to not post CDN content.  Second safest is to post your own CDN content, either with server-side intelligence to post the appropriate URLs or with anycast DNS.
Key points: Any of the CDN companies you might use are in the U.S. or subject to be bossed around by tyrannical old farts wearring black mumus from the U.S.  You must never ever surrender your certificates, ever, to anyone.  Ever.
Suppose you forego CDNs.  With JS and CSS compaction, and proper "static" content client-side caching, and enough RAM on your edge servers / frontends, you can always afford the extra 400 milliseconds or so that takes for your users not to be compromised.
As always, minimizing the amount of computation your servers must do to respond to a request will help you with both regular costs  and with DDoS protection costs.

Actually, this is true only in socialized markets, where hospitals are "private" in name only, but the payer is not the user of the service.  In competitive markets, where the payer is the user of the service, doctors can't get away with this, because customers ditch them.
Private hospitals work very well, *unless laws* ruin the incentives that private hospitals need to work well.
This is true for *everything*, not just for health care.

Or course, but that's irrelevant. This was never about forcing every user to support statelessness.
This is about some assholes here who **hate** statelessness, and thus want to *deny / censor / downplay* the obvious relationship between a stateless currency and the very group of stateless people that nurtured, advanced, adopted and celebrated it to begin with. These assholes want this place to lie to everyone by omission, using specious and cowardly "arguments" like "people won't like us if they discover that Group X is affiliated with Bitcoin".
Yes, demanding that references to statelessness in a stateless currency community be censored, is an asshole, petty, hateful, niggardly, deceitful maneuver that does us *all* a disservice.

I guess you should look up a definition of word 'criminal'
Which one definition of ~~sinner~~criminal, exactly?
The definition that says "criminal is he who does corrupt and malevolent things, except if one is part of this particular magical gang, in which case one is a Messiah to be worshipped"?
The one that says "criminal is he who disobeys the contents of certain papers written by a magical gang"?
The one that says "criminal is whoever we -- gangsters and supporters of gangsters -- say he is"?


I'm not going to be surprised by *yet another* person whose very concepts have been hijacked with special pleading by the gang of criminals that rule him.  Novelty surprises me, not expected behavior.

You laugh, but that's exactly what these "regulation" conversations are about. They're always about how to cut the pie of corruption.
Most people deride the "back room conversation" explanation for absurd legislation as "conspiracy theories".  Then, when they're slapped in the face with absurd and clearly favoritist legislation, they act like "huh?  why did we get this?  what happened?".
Idiots.  As a matter of fact, the collection of absurdity and venality that is modern legislation simply cannot be explained without accepting *corruption as the fundamental driver* for it.  And part of that is secret negotiations between stakeholders to which we're usually not privy, except in the (rather numerous) cases where evidence of one of these negotiations leaks to the public.

Ah, so you are trying to teach me about government because "I'm ignorant about governments", but you come here and deny that Mao Zedong was the head of a government?
Tell us all, how did Mao kill 30 million people *all by himself*?  He didn't do it with the assistance of *millions of people who all obeyed Mao under the belief that he was head of government?*
Ah.  Aha.  Yeah.  We're supposed to believe that Mao is a magical wizard who starves millions to death by waving a magic wand.  So did the Xin dynasty members too.
Cos, you see, **according to you (and no one else on Planet Earth**), they totally were *not* the head of the Chinese government, just like Mao wasn't either.  And, according to you (*and only you*), "empires are not states".
Of course, for the **rest of us** (including the person who wrote the Wikipedia article you're quoting), reality binds us, and we recognize that both Mao and the Xin dynasty were *heads of state*.  Regardless of what we'd rather believe.
Here's some concrete figures of democide by governments, that should shed some light on your bullshit graphs:  
That's 270 million people.  Just in the 20th century.  Excluding wars.
That's what the institution you have faith in, and you deny has been the cause of the worst mass murders in history, has perpetrated against Mankind.
You just tell me and others that comparing these government massacres to regular murderers is "silly" because you have faith in government, and like any other religious wacko, the object of your worship cannot possibly be the very reason people become so murderous against their own.  Like any other person victim of a mass delusion, you tell yourself and others lies so that you can suspend your processing of the undeniable observable facts that would question corrupt beliefs.

C'mon, tell us how other Godvernments are "bad" but *your* Godvernment is "good" (for some magical unknown reason) and would never do such a thing (oops, they already did).   Tell us how the organization you defend is allowed to murder / cage / ruin / brutalize people who disobey them, but people aren't allowed to defend themselves from the organization.

The norm "My house, my rules" is only valid when you legitimately own the land, which no government does.

Of course, he *never* says "I hate you" -- that would demonstrate honesty and vulnerability.  He was probably treated as he himself behaves, which is why he incorrectly believes he can get his way with me through irate rage and manipulation.
Why? Well... If he had an argument, he'd put it forward... But he never does. So we know it isn't because I am wrong. Ergo, every time he rages and attacks he's just showing everyone how his beliefs are indefensibly false, which is why he needs to shoot the messenger. He needs to stalk me. He needs to kill me in his mind.

I envision a society where wrongdoers are completely locked out of society -- no road access, no food access, no housing access, no electricity access, no security access -- until they willingly make their victims whole, or are shot by their next prospective victim.
Right now we have a society where perfectly decent people are dragged into cages because of arbitrary orders ("laws"), and where actual shithead violent asshole criminals get free housing on our dime, but can't be compelled by their victims to make their victims whole.  WTF.

This was before sexting so yes, an utter waste of paper. And it was with Microsoft Exchange client too, so it was doubly ruinous.

Wasn't even thick. Cellphones were for rich people and couldn't fit 50 contacts, much less import/export.

Sorry, you are not responding to the *content* of my comment.
Remember when I said "the Bitcoin system of transfers and the blockchain"? My point was precisely to note how the author is talking specifically about that, and not about external entities that use Bitcoin.
So responses that talk about how "Coinbase could do this or that" *aren't addressing what the author means*. They are conflating two very  different things to make a false generalization about one of them.
Yes, Coinbase could start defrauding their customers. No, that is not proof that Bitcoin itself can be made into a fractional reserve system. Capisce?

Psychiatrists would universally classify this reply of yours as *gaslighting* -- that is, blatantly denying a person's own experience to his face, when he himself is telling you the truth about what he remembers. 
The truth is, you don't know whether he agrees or not, and the circumstantial "evidence" you cite to gaslight your interlocutor doesn't matter for many reasons (which I will omit because they are too obvious). So, if the man says he does not agree, you cannot deny that, because only he and he himself can know whether he agrees or not. **Not you**.
But you are a mean-spirited liar, who tries to convince sane people that they are delusional, only to protect your own dogmas. Hence your seemingly psychotic behavior where you try to make others feel psychotic.
When you have to resort to *gaslighting* to make your "point", it's pretty much obvious that your "point" is both delusional and fucked, and you personally are an asshole to others.

EDIT: republished here  I love when a Reddit post inspires a kickass blog post.
What you're saying makes about the same amount of sense as saying "I think we should remove politics from voting".
That is, makes no sense at all.  Bitcoin is a currency that is first and foremost a **political experiment that hardcodes some radical political opinions** in the computer code.  Those opinions are **more libertarian than the Libertarian Party itself**:
1. Fixed supply.
2. Stateless issuance.
3. No centralized government control.
4. Strictly voluntary adoption and use.
It is *not up for debate* that these properties of Bitcoin *are, in fact, libertarian positions*.  This is a fact as much as "water is wet" is a statement of fact.  The positions embedded in the code are widely-documented to be political positions of libertarians.  Which is what you would expect when *the people who control the code are, for the most part, libertarians*.
What's more -- these libertarian properties of the currency *cannot be changed after the fact*.  The way Satoshi Nakamoto decided to solve the Byzantine Generals' Problem -- specifically, the use of Merkle trees -- makes it *impossible to change these properties after the fact*, at least without risking a division of Bitcoiners between genuine/standard and new/fake... which would instantly destroy the value of the new/fake currency itself.  *That* is probably the single most underappreciated yet most important genius of Satoshi's invention.
Now, nobody is forcing you to buy Bitcoin (see, again that "pesky" libertarian idea?).  If you dislike those opinions, you are free to start your own coin or join another coin that embodies the non-libertarian ideals.  Freicoin, for example, is a coin that will tax your wealth every year.  It's perfectly compatible with pro-government beliefs.  You should buy them.
Wait, you don't want to buy Freicoin because you prefer Bitcoin?  *Then, I'm sorry to inform you, you are quite literally endorsing those libertarian opinions you so despise, with your money.*
You can't have your cake and eat it too.  You can't have Bitcoin without the political opinions embedded in Bitcoin that made it so successful.  A Bitcoin without these political opinions would be a watered-down Governmentcoin, incompatible with Bitcoin, going its own way.  As the Freicoin experiment has shown, people prefer the currency whose computer code literally executes libertarian values.
I acknowledge that this may not persuade you, but (here's the part where I laugh) *we don't care* -- we're still looking forward to your ~~hypocritical~~ practical endorsement of the **first stateless digital currency**.  For the first time in the world, *we libertarians don't have to give two shits about your political opinions* -- as long as you're buying Bitcoin and not stealing them, you're (apparently sadly for you) *playing along with the rules of the libertarian game*.
So give us your paper rectangles, we will give you real money.  Thanks.  And you're welcome.

I am afraid the large contingent of people who will use Bitcoin to deny funding to the organized criminals won't be representing their viewpoint here:
1. There are lots of ways to protect their bitcoins from the organized criminals at this point.
2. They probably have a lot to lose of the organized criminals stole from them at this point.
2. They have no reason to single themselves out in a forum where the organized criminals will see them.
So, if any of you were wondering why you don't yet see here any defense of protecting one's own property from organized theft, now you know why.

"We matter so little", that you spend ample time insulting me and others who don't share your belief system.  *As if it mattered*.
So which is it?  Do we matter or not?  Nice contradiction there.
Keep talking.  The more you talk, the more obvious it becomes that you are very confused, *angry*, and incapable to form a coherent argument for any of your beliefs.

I initially decided to respond to your points, but then I noticed that you aren't providing any evidence to back up your beliefs. You're talking about your beliefs but you don't substantiate them. No evidence, no facts.
Not even an indication that you process the counterarguments presented to you. E.g. I shared with you Paul Graham's article (which outlines your theory and presents sound refutations), you didn't even mention it in your reply.
This indicates to me that you don't actually have any interest in having a fact-based exchange of ideas. 
I am not interested in that. I think that is a waste of my time. I think you are wasting my time when I present you with evidence that conflicts with your beliefs, and you respond by handwaving the evidence away and dishing out more baseless beliefs.

The similarities are skin deep. In communism, you are shot or caged if you resist orders.  In Bitcoin mining no such thing happens.
Communism isn't "let's all work together to solve problems". No, that's called *cooperation*. Communism is "let's all work together to solve problems, **and if you resist, you'll be violently punished**". I'm not going to let you gloss over that important fact, just like I wouldn't let you get away with "man is biped and featherless, ergo it's the same as a plucked chicken".

None of that addresses the point that the article made -- the point is that the criminals doing business under the name "IRS" could just pretend that "foreign" means whatever they need it to mean, in order to punish you for not letting yourself be robbed by them, and then pass that off as "justice".

Hey, it happens man.  :-)
@_date: 2013-03-13 08:01:43
Great way of putting it :-)
I've always found the doublethink funny, that a person would say "how can we allow a regular peasant to build a nuclear weapon" (which is an extremely remote possibility) all the while they "allow" gilded sociopaths *in actual reality* to build massive stockpiles **of the very same thing they claim to be terrified of**.
It's exactly like Christians who say "genocide is evil" but, when the genocide is ordered by God, suddenly genocide is virtuous!
I want you to observe quite the curious phenomenon, which I call "magical exception dysfunction".  With these superstitous wackos (religious or secular), as soon as you generalize *their own sanctimonious arguments* to their *ruler* / *deity*, these idiots' *own arguments* are magically *suspended*.  Invariably, they are superseded by a flurry of convenient ad-hoc case-by-case *"but you see, in this case it's different because &lt;insert irrelevant difference&gt;"* excuses and superstitions, that rationalize why the ruler / deity **must** be authorized to do that which, just a few moments ago, was "simply abominable" for anyone else to do.  **Every** statist and religious belief is supported by this dysfunction, in one way or another, as these beliefs are untenable without the dysfunction affording the necessary doublethink to maintain two opposite positions at the same time.
For this reason, I observe that the people who *allegedly* claim to be "pro gun control" **really are not**.  When they say "no one should own guns", they're prey to the magical exception dysfunction.  What they actually want is **a gun monopoly** on the hands of a certain *magical* group, who must *magically* have **explicit authorization to murder anyone else** who dares resist orders to surrender their own guns.  "Gun control" is simply the *false name* given to this preposterous and absurd superstition, because they're not willing to spell out the actual implications of their superstition (kill / cage everyone, who is *not* an authority, and insists on owning a gun).  You see, saying that out loud would make them look very bad.  Thus, the false name to cloak the reality of what they want.
"No one should have guns, therefore we must give all the guns to this tiny group of people who can kill and cage anyone who disobeys them."  That's what they believe.  Their blatantly self-contradictory belief is simply stark raving mad, absurd to the point of being simply inconceivable to the sane mind.  Localized schizophrenia?  You decide!

We already have that.  It's called "laws".
The problem is that the antisocial gang who is **supposed** to offer the service of enforcing these "laws", and **demands** that you pay for this shit "service", just **doesn't do that job**.
That's it.
So do you think that giving them more power will solve the problem?  They already have nuclear bombs.

Yes, some people call certain categories of robbery "tax".  I am aware of that.
@_date: 2013-03-21 19:11:32
Ah, so your point is that I'm using a certain word in a way you *don't* like.
@_date: 2013-02-23 23:54:31


With due respect, to the extent I understand what a "tax" is -- in terms of people doing things, no people threaten you with caging / ruin / pain / death if you refuse / resist to pay -- I don't see transaction fees as "taxes".
Transaction fees are fully optional.  Even if they switched to mandatory in the future, they would still only be charged to people using an optative service, so in that sense, transaction fees are no more "taxes" than paying for a hamburger you ordered.  That is to say, not a tax, but a consensual exchange of value.
You may differ and have a different opinion, of course.
Relying on my experience, I suspect having a different opinion would be the result of deliberately confusing robbing someone and collecting a debt from someone.  Or -- the more sophisticated version -- pretending that certain debts arise via unilateral nonconsensual decree ("if the government says so...").  Or -- the most sophisticated version -- pretending that the victim of theft has somehow consented to the theft because of some arbitrary circumstance ("why don't you move?").
All of these interpretations of the specific type of robbery we're talking about, of course, arising from the tendency of people to give *magical exceptional treatment* to the actions of a certain group of people doing business as "the government".  Namely, if I kill some brown people and then show up at your door demanding payment for a service and threatening to punish you if you don't comply, you'd call me crazy and defend yourself.  But if I do the exact same things, while donning special magical costumes and calling myself "government", you'll call my demands "tax", give into my demands, and hate those who resist me.
Of course, none of those views will persuade me.

If fraud is the misrepresentation of reality to obtain a particular goal, isn't poisoning someone (by giving him some substance under pretexts) fraud?
Go back and reread what I said. What did I say about fraud earlier? Did I say that voluntary acts were limited to just initiation or threats of violence? No, right?
OK. Given what I just told you, *do you think I consider poisoning human beings a voluntary act?* That is a yes or no question.
@_date: 2013-12-30 02:24:26
Possible is a yes or no question.  The answer to that question is *yes*.  Of course the top malefactors can write whatever orders they want in their magical papers, get together and perform a dumb ritual, and then have thousands of thugs (who have faith in the top malefactors) enforce those orders.
Probable?  I think it's probable they will sabotage or otherwise ban some or all people who use Bitcoin.  These malefactors don't like competition.  A large part of their power derives from being able to pay thugs and give the thugs orders... and the way they pay the thugs is by making up funny money.  If most people start giving up the funny money for voluntary money like Bitcoin, the value of the funny money will plummet, which means the malefactors' ability to pay the thugs will be severely diminished, which in turn means the malefactors lose their power.  So sabotaging Bitcoin will be a priority of them at some point.
Likely that their ban will have effect?  It will have *some* effect, in my opinion.  I think it will stifle trade and will drive Bitcoin users and owners underground.  I think it will cause some Bitcoiners to cash out by looking toward people engaged in illegal activities.  It will definitely have some impact in the price, but I have no idea if it will make the price rise or fall.

Like that, there are a zillion "arguments" that can be used to attack Bitcoin, all equally invalid, all equally reliant on the exceptionalism of State-given Commandments, all given out by worshippers of State omnipotence, like candy handed out to kids by pederasts.
All these arguments, at their core, say "But Bitcoin threatens the ultimate power and control of the people who are my Daddy figures that give me orders and could kill me with impunity if I disobeyed and resisted".  Which is completely true.  Bitcoin really and literally does threaten their funding -- no funding, no organized crime.  And many people fear that, with a fear more intense than the fear of their own fathers being slaughtered.
As you can see, *all these attacks on Bitcoin are based on fear*.  Fear that, as you can see, won't ever be cured by attempting to portray Bitcoin as "the goody-two-shoes currency that won't ever be used to sell cigarettes to kids".  Because, even if that happened, then State worshippers will just lie to attack Bitcoin.  In the mind of the people who fear Bitcoin, anything -- truth and lies, doesn't matter -- is fair game to destroy it.
Change causes fear.  But then causes adaptation.  Let the people fear.  Adaptation isn't far after that.

"Not sure what the problem is with being registered"
Aha, I know this tactic. You first *pretend* that you need to be informed of a very obvious consequence of an action, then you [*deny or minimize*]( all the sensible reasons and historical examples people give you to be wary of registration.  That's the simple agenda of this tactic of yours.
Disinformation at its finest! But why would you disinform people?
Well, at the *very core* of your beliefs lies the highly corrupt moral belief that there exists a magical group of people, exempt from all ethical norms, who ought to have the power to order people to do certain things, and punish (violently if needed) anyone who disobeys them.  Of course, the corollary is that anything these gangsters propose must be "good", and any reasons to oppose them must be "bad".
The whole "I can see advantages to obeying" is but a mask for this central belief. It is a pretense to **divert people from recognizing** that threatening peaceful people with punishment for not registering their property (tactic traditionally used to make it easy to steal from them later) is **evil**.
This obvious conclusion questions your central belief. But no one must ever question your central belief. Even you yourself cannot discuss your belief openly either, because to verbalize such absurd and malevolent belief, is to expose it to questioning.
So what do you do? You distract, offer red herrings, fog. You play coy. You sabotage the conversation by frustrating people in it.
Which is exactly what you did.

 awareness note for everyone in the Bitcoin community
There is no such thing as an "unregulated" exchange. *All of them* operate under open threat of being ruined (if they disobey orders) and its owners being caged (or killed, if they meaningfully resist the orders). That is what "regulation" means.
**No piece of paper guarantees** you won't endure these acts of terror. All you can do is panhandle / bribe your way to a lower risk rung, but even with all "the papers in order", you can still be fucked up. No guarantees, *because the people who will harm you, have already been bought*.
If this fit on a tweet, I would tweet it.
@_date: 2013-08-02 08:32:18


Then your definition has no basis in observable reality, as many perfectly peaceful people are punished every day in the name of "regulation".
I see no reason to discuss false definitions of "regulation" as much as I don't see any reason to discuss the art of lovemaking with a rapist.  Either your definition deals with people doing stuff, or you can gaze at your navel alone.  I don't give a shit about discussing imaginary "wrongs" in the name of justifying actual aggression against anyone.
Those are the terms under which you can have a discussion with me.  Take them or leave them.

Ah, more denialism -- this time you've come up with an "acid" excuse to *pretend* that corn sugar's low subsidized price has nothing to do with the food industry's choice of prime matter for sweeteners.  Yes, aha, sure, it's all magic and no one can explain why making sugar out of corn (and *only corn*) is so cheap.
So, since it's clear that pointing out reality isn't actually working for you, I'll change my direction here, and ask you a question.
What's your ultimate goal in denying the reality that government corn subsidies ultimately caused the food industry to switch to high-fructose corn sugar?
This is well-known, observed and empirically established fact, so I'm not going to pretend to debate it as if your questioning this fact had any significance (it doesn't, it's bullshit, and you know it).  So I'll simply ask you: what's your goal here?
What is it that you want?  Reality won't magically and retroactively change, just because you deny the fact you're denying.  Manufacturers won't stop using HFCS, just because you deny said fact.  You won't get healthier food, just because you deny said fact.  *None of your stated goals and preferences will ever be accomplished, and you won't avoid the government-caused diabeetus*, just because you deny reality.
So, if denial of reality won't actually get you what you *say* you want, and it only got you dick and misery in the Reddit department (unlike me, who got upvotes and free Reddit gold), *why, then, do you deny reality*"?  What's your **true goal** with this stubborn, hard-headed, recalcitrant denial of yours?
I want to understand what is the core preoccupation of people like you, who selectively ignore reality, and blame the wrong (*decent*) people for circumstances you dislike.

There are no "arguments" against deflationary currencies to address here.
Here is the only thing that matters: *what do people choose when, instead of being terrorized into using a certain type of Monopoly papers, they are given a voluntary choice?*
That question now has an answer. Bitcoin has shown conclusively that peaceful people voluntarily choose deflationary currencies when given a chance, even when there is an alternative that is inflationary (Freicoin et al).
That -- observable reality -- is all anyone needs to know, and you can know it because you have eyes. Everything else is pseudointellectualloid sophisms, usually made-up to justify herding people into being slowly robbed. Sure, Krugman et al are rolling in their future graves because they *want* to continue terrorizing people into cowing to their technocratic power, but Bitcoin has made them irrelevant.

Not necessarily.
If Satoshi Dice wanted all the benefits of Bitcoin without spamming the Bitcoin blockchain, Satoshi Dice could have been implemented with a private blockchain variant, and then deposits/cashouts would be the only integration points where Bitcoin blockchain transactions happen.
When Bitcoin was invented, at *no point* did anyone say, state, propose or suggest that **all** transactions between entities **must** be dumped into the blockchain.  Many (in fact, possibly most) transactions can be verifiably done off-main-blockchain, either because you trust the clearinghouse performing those transactions, or because they are handled with a private (but publicly auditable) blockchain variant.

Yes, some people -- fools whom I pity -- do believe that, because they are historically ignorant idiots who can't think well and confuse a currency being decreed legally with a currency being intrinsically worthless.
That is because these myopic idiots have only ever lived in a world where all fiat currencies are worthless, so these myopic idiots think these two categories are synonyms when they are in fact not synonyms at all.  Not having studied history before the 20th century -- probably not having studied history before CATV was invented -- they have zero knowledge that there were *many* countries throughout many millennia, where currency with intrinsic (use) value was actually **fiat** (literally decreed as legal tender).
Oh yes, this is historical fact.  As it happens, the very people who **invented** the term "fiat" **quite literally** made *gold* (money with intrinsic use value) **fiat**.  And, whaddya know, *most people today agree with these people*.  That is why the definition they made up is **first**.  That is why your looser-than-a-prostitute's-vagina second and third order definitions are *second and third*.
Who am I going to believe?  Idiots who can't think and can't be arsed to study history and etymology?  Random people on the Internet who argue vehemently, without knowledge, for secondary and even tertiary misdefinitions of a well-understood word?  Or the people who invented the word?

People say this because they don't understand what efficiency actually is.  Efficiency is measured by comparing the cost of credible alternatives *to accomplish a specific purpose*.  As such, Bitcoin is the most efficient way to prevent double-spends, *and* the most efficient way to do secure money transfers even when compared to banks.
A bicycle is more efficient than a car to get people to a destination.  But to get a person to his destination *far away* in *very little time* and with near-zero physical exertion?  There's just no competition between the bike and the car, because the car is the only thing among the two that can actually *accomplish* the goal.
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:09:28


You are witnessing, quite literally and in real-time, the complete and utter annihilation of this preconception about currencies you just explained here, along with many others.
This preconception exists because people still don't grok the most fundamental knowledge about value itself: value isn't an intrinsic characteristic of any thing -- it is a *subjective relationship in the mind of a person appreciating the thing*.  In other words: value doesn't spring from things -- *you assign value to things in your mind*, and that value depends as much on your particular circumstances at any point in time, as it depends on the uses that the thing may have.  If two people happen to value shit cakes at one egg each, then they can trade eggs and shit cakes.  Same with Bitcoin.

***Waaaaaait wait wait***, hold on for just a second. That is **not** what you originally asked for.
I quote:


That question has been answered already. If you are honest, you will accept the answer before changing the subject. **You don't get to reject, ignore or deny the answer by changing the question after it's been answered.**
Whether Satoshi himself is or isn't a self-professed ancap has **nothing** to do with whether Bitcoin was or wasn't *inspired by ancap ideas*. They are separate matters; Satoshi could be a Marxist himself, it still would not make Bitcoin any less inspired by ancap ideas. Most importantly, you don't get to unilaterally move the goalposts or conflate the two now by demanding evidence of an unrelated belief.
If you're not gonna accept direct evidence that answers your question, at least be **honest** and say that upfront; that way we know in advance that you're unreasonable and not to waste time with fulfilling your requests.
In any case, you're not gonna move the goalposts now. That kinda thing doesn't escape me without me pointing it out. Hell naw.

The fact that they refuse to give the (allegedly "stored") property back to their owners, or even let them see the property, is *proof enough* that the property is long gone.
Note how the asshat you're replying to is attempting to reframe the issue, such that the burden of proof *appears* to fall on the victims of the theft and those who -- sensibly -- suspect the theft has occurred.  This is a common gaslighting trick -- when you demand proof, the shithead turns around and accuses you -- in which [the logic of the asshats is exactly as back-asswards as depicted in this religious cartoon](
In actuality, as you will learn from every legal and moral system in the world, the burden of proof to show that consigned property is safe *lies not in consignor of property*, but on the **consignee**, and absence of the consigned property is proof of either theft or criminal negligence on the part of the consignee, rather than "tin-foil hattery" on the part of the victim.  Which should be obvious.
Yet this guy insults and mocks people who understand this elementary thought, with terms like "tin-foil hattery".  Ludicrous, offensive and perverted behavior.
Well, after watching his behavior, It's safe to assume that they're just full of shit and hate, and they know they're disinforming people.  Just think about it -- imagine the kind of malevolent creep one needs to be to tell you "you're crazy", when he knows that whoever has your stuff is refusing to give it back, and then tells lies apologetic of the person who's obviously decided to rob you.  This guy is *that asshole*, times a million.

Your interlocutor even confirms it when he speaks of "public outcry", which means he *knows full well* that, *unless the ruling class fears for their power, the rulers literally don't give a fuck.* How pathological is that prospect for "change"?
Now that I think about it, the belief you described is no different from the religious belief that praying to a God will make the priests fuck and fellate fewer children.

Yeah, exactly -- if the trustee who has the evidence to prove that he did *not* rob you, refuses to furnish that evidence... yeah, he robbed you.
See, it's very simple to discover the statist insanity.  Just take the exact same situation, and replace the costumes, then ask what does the situation qualify as.
Say, take the exact same thing that the Fed did to other nations.  Now imagine it's me who's perpetrating it, and I'm perpetrating it to the idiot who's still defending the indefendible in this thread.  What would he say?  Here's what he would *not* be saying: "well, I suppose you won't prove to me that you still have my stuff, but I'm sure you didn't rob me".  He would be calling the police on me, immediately, on the double, to have me jailed for embezzlement.
But, you see, because it's *the Fed* who's perpetrating embezzlement here, his statist "logic" kicks in, and all the excuses to rationalize their heist start popping up.  His brain melts as it twists and gyrates to try and find a way to call the Fed's embezzlement "not embezzlement".  He lies and distorts the truth, to others for sure, but mostly to himself, and he attacks anyone who prods this incredibly delicate dynamic equilibrium between lies in his brain.
It's just one more example of statist "logic", where evil becomes virtue when evil is perpetrated by the Holy Priests of Godvernment (whether or not the Sacred Scrolls of Law permit them to do so).

This guy still thinks that groveling to people who give him orders (which he has to obey or else be thrown in a cage / ruined / assaulted), ensures that only *angels* will give him orders, and only of the *benevolent* kind.  See, if you bend over and put the right piece of paper in the right magical box with the right sociopath's name, "all is well".  Baahaaha.
Listen, pal, I know that, if you didn't repeat that bullshit in your test, you would have gotten an F, and no X Bax or outings for your trouble.  And I know they made you chant those stupid song mantras, and they made you revere cloth as if the very blood flow to your dick depended on it, and they told you that good equals being very obedient to the "authoritays", and that only bad people disobey the magic papers that the sociopaths wrote.
But you're not in school anymore, and there's no teacher to grade you on your ability to repeat doctrine.  In the here and now, there's only you and me, and you know very well I don't fall for that utterly ridiculous shit.  You know they all lie, they all commit abominations that would get thousands of years in jail if committed by a peasant, you know they are all corrupt as fuck and you wouldn't leave a dollar bill next to them.
So drop the fucking act.  Fuck off with that shit.  Seriously, grow out of the civics indoctrination delusions already.  You're an adult.  Act like one.


Good old "blame the victim" apology.
See, when a regular peasant does something evil, it's very clear that he is responsible and to blame for his actions.
But, when someone in government robs, murders, assaults or kidnaps a peaceful person, we're supposed to find fault, *not with the perpetrator*, but with the people who were fooled by the campaign lies of the perpetrator.
Up is down, good is evil, being forced to empower a sociopath is equivalent to being responsible for the sociopath's misdeeds, et cetera.  Solid statist "logic".

It implies that people who resist being unilaterally imposed obligations they didn't accept, are some sort of "cheats" or dishonest individuals.  The implication is both baseless and offensive to them, just like calling a conscientious objector "coward" would be offensive, or a rape victim "slut" would be offensive, or calling a person who refuses to help you out "thief" would be offensive.

It might be "good enough" for you that "so-and-so *said* von Nothaus intentionally misled people into believing he was selling U.S. currency", but that's not good enough for me to accept your conclusion.
What the prosecutors *claimed* and *reality* are two different things.  I am looking for evidence from *reality*.  I would think this standard of evidence isn't too difficult to meet.  You could, for example, show proof that von Nothaus *actually billed* his currency as U.S. legal tender.
In other words: I don't accept the word of "judges" and "prosecutors" as divine.       I need to see the facts.

You are dangerously wrong if you think they can't arbitrarily and conveniently change what the words mean in order to ruin BTC businesses. 
They did it to NotHaus, accusing and blaming him of the most preposterous things he didn't do, then they redefined the terms to mean that he did do them, and then they locked them up.  Your interlocutor is correct and you are dangerously mistaken. 
Epistemic war is what these criminals do best. You are dealing with scruple-free intelligences and self-righteous malevolences your decently-raised pedestrian brain cannot comprehend.  They got your grandaddy to call gold "funny money" and unbacked pieces of paper "real money".  Heck,  they probably got you to believe that "faith" or "threat of organized aggression" is a valid form of backing of a currency.
What in the world makes you mistakenly believe that they won't reinterpret past words to sabotage Bitcoin - the best competitor to their power they've ever faced? 
"They wouldn't ever do THAT" think again, sonny, whatever is it that you think they "wouldn't do", they've done multiple times in the past, and even worse.

Bitcoin is a very appealing mechanism to avoid inflation, better so than gold and silver because it can't be stolen like gold and silver can. I  wager the people in Asia who use and trade Bitcoin do so because of that.

I am going to bold my reply because only an idiot could make an "argument" like the one I am about to quote, so maybe you need the text bolded.


 called A TRADE.  You promise to give money in exchange for a promise of ***some other money in the future***.  That is to say, your stuff is now owned by them only ***conditionally and provided they deliver on their promise***.  There is nothing special about this trade.  The interest they were getting was simply a share of the profits of the other party.  Why would any alarm bells go off?
 you fulfilled your side of the trade, but the other party reneged to fulfill his part of the trade, it stands to reason that you still own the thing you gave the other person (magical papers notwithstanding).  If they do not return what is yours, that's simple robbery.  Just because the trade involves time instead of objects does not make it any different.  It might have been prudent not to make that trade with a Cypriot bank, but that does not mean that the victims of the robbery are at fault.  Pretending otherwise is blaming the victims.

Well I thought so at the beginning, but then I figured out that muting the bot unless requested actually helps because it makes the person requesting the bot's verbosity responsible for the "spamminess" of the bot, whereas previously mods from various subreddits were calling the bot "spammy" and threatening to ban it, which would have nullified the bot's capacity to call attention to people's generosity.

Your question is valid, if a change in topic.  I'll let others address it.  Now I want you to meditate about how this question sounds to your interlocutor.
Allow me to posit a different scenario, so you can get what this means more easily.  *Warning: the scenario I'm going to present to you is by no means equivalent to the scenario you are discussing with Bitcoinbaby222*, but it will help you be in the state of mind that Bitcoinbaby222 is right now, which might help you understand how your question comes across.
Suppose I, an ugly man with rapist tendencies, come to this thread and talk about how great it is to have the government force women to have sex with me.  Those people are contributing to me getting sex via rape -- aiding and abetting rape, unquestionably.
Suppose I make a Reddit post musing about how the government might rein in the growing trend of women refusing to comply, enabled by a new technology that allows them to stop the rapes before they happen.
Now suppose that Bitcoinbaby222 posts a comment in my thread, saying "mandatory sex is RAPE - this technology will end the idea that a small group of people can rape women without consequence"... yadda yadda, the whole "taxation is theft" crowd speech.
Now suppose that I reply to him "OK, but how will you ensure that I will get laid?  Will women who voluntarily want to have sex with me be sufficient, or should the government also do prostitution?"
*How do you think Bitcoinbaby222 feels about answering that question?*
When you ask a voluntaryist "but how will government be funded without tax?", he's *going* to read that question as "but how will a bunch of violent thugs who bribe the populace be paid without massive theft?".  You should assume that the answer to that question will be a variation of "You're missing the point -- I don't want a bunch of violent thugs to be paid, I certainly don't accept organized theft as an answer to that question, and I certainly don't believe that *any* services are 'worth' the entire society tolerating organized theft."
Only once you've accepted the idea that taxation is theft, can you start thinking in earnest about ways to solve social problems without theft.  So long as you still believe that theft isn't theft but rather a virtuous charity, you will inevitably refuse any answer to society's problems relying on voluntary behavior, because you might just think you already have an answer.

Actually, no.  The price went up because they released the dollar-to-gold and dollar-to-silver peg, which was unrealistic given the amount of M1 unbacked by metals they had printed.  When they prohibited people from owning gold, and stole people's gold, gold's price remained stagnant for decades.

Let's apply this theory of "voluntary" to other acts:






...makes about as much sense.
If there's a threat backing a unilateral request, the request is *not a request*, and it's certainly *not voluntary*.
I know you Americans are brainwashed since you are very young in civics class, when you're told that threatening people to get them to surrender money is "voluntary".  It's not.  You were lied to.


Actually, the dishonesty happened when you were erroneously informed that being told to do something and threatened with ruin if you disobey was "voluntary".  *That* was dishonest, because it was done with full knowledge that the truth was the opposite of what they claimed.


Your morals were already compromised when you were led to believe, incorrectly, that doing something under pain of ruin is "voluntary", or that protecting yourself from thugs who would ruin you is "dishonest".

I highly doubt that drug pushers would extend Ripple credit lines to their customers (terrible business to give credit to a druggie!).
I think, rather, that the pushers will take cash, but issue IOUs to their suppliers, all the way back to the drug lords.
Then, if someone from the pusher crowd fails to make good on their IOUs, whack.
But this won't be a problem, because the IOUs are transitively resolved by Ripple, usually going all the way back to a Ripple gateway... and, even if this failed, the pusher has guaranteed cash and it's easy to make good even internationally, by wiring Bitcoins purchased locally from your organic Bitcoin farmer.
Much easier and cleaner. This mechanism protects everyone in the market chain, while potentially morose clients don't need to take the risk of debt to someone who has full auto guns.

This is one of the few statements of yours that is literally true at face value.  Of course, just because I don't want to believe something, doesn't mean that something is a lie.
Unfortunately, the statement also has an implication (which you don't actually state openly).  The implication is that "I don't want to believe certain things".  This implication is in the standard style of "have you stopped beating your wife yet?".
And, of course, that is a personal accusation that is simply false, as I have demonstrated repeatedly by pointing to certain aspects of reality that you have consistently distorted, denied or hidden.
The case here is simply that you tell lies and misrepresent the truth, about me, and about Dotcom.
As usual with you, you weave a lie in a truth to make yourself sound more believable.  This latest comment of yours was no exception to said AssholeBanana rule.

Doesn't mean gold has intrinsic value.


Value: a relationship of *judgment* from a person to an object, that varies constantly depending on the circumstances.
There is nothing *in the gold* (belonging naturally) that "makes it valuable", or which, if stripped, would make gold "not gold" (essential).  And value does not refer to a characteristic of the object itself anyway.
Therefore, **no intrinsic value.**  It's an oxymoron.

I'm not arguing anything, except -- most recently -- against the (authoritarian, self-serving, baseless and false) belief that you can know *better* than others what they should do with their money (and the inevitably statist corollary that someone should be entitled to force or manipulate people into using their money in ways they wouldn't otherwise do).
You don't know that, Mr. Monday Evening Economist.


For the same reason that I can't tell you the answer to that, you also can't tell me the answer to that.


I haven't "decided" anything of the sort.  In choosing Bitcoin as my favorite currency, I have expressed a *personal preference* for a hard limit of 21 million coins, but that's about it.  Don't confuse my personal preferences with my conclusions as to what is "optimal" or not.
See?  That's called *humility*.
And I don't really need to argue for or against any economic belief, because reality will set wrong people straight all on its own.  Whether you are right or wrong about your catastrophizing and pseudoscientific Keynesian predictions about "static money supply OMG WTF HERCOLUBUS, PLZ PROTECT ME, LORD KEYNES" (haha, couldn't resist), **we shall see**.
**We shall see.**  I suspect I will be proven right, but if I'm wrong, I'll change my mind about what I prefer, because I'm not an idiot who deliberately prefers poverty to riches.

"Money laundering" is a propaganda term designed to discredit and malframe the act of using your money without the authorization of people who call themselves "government". That is all it is.

If the support an institution receives is 100% voluntary, and the institution does not threaten anyone with violent punishment for not supporting it or abetting those who refuse to support the institution, then that institution is not a state.
I know this because the core trait of a state -- as any political theorist will tell you, or any political professor like Obama himself has publicly said -- is its monopoly of violence, so any institution not perceived to have. this monopoly on violence is by definition not a state.
Claiming otherwise would be like saying that a figure which doesn't have four right angles is a "rectangle". An absurd and deliberate doublethink.

For the microtransactions use case, Bitcoin was already "dead".
Suppose an altcoin that trades off some of Bitcoin's features for microtransaction support.  It won't make a difference in that space, and probably won't conquer Bitcoin's core market anyway, because it just lacks the Bitcoin features that people want.
Now, if you suggest that there will be an alt that is equal or superior to Bitcoin, and *also* supports microtransactions, yes, of course, that would probably cause people to move from Bitcoin to that new currency.  Which is fine, as that means progress has been made.  *The problem, as always, is actually coming up with such a beast*.  Go ahead and do it.

I'm sorry, but he won't. I have the privilege to know firsthand that he won't, and why.
We (the missus and I) had dinner with him (I think it was Mongolian). It was a nice night.
However, I did try to broach the subject. I mean, why wouldn't I? I was having dinner with one of my young adulthood heroes, who continues to champion government despite the fact that **literally every cause** he has fought has government as its root cause . How could I *not* ask him about it?
I asked him "so, Richard, I donno if you've noticed, but every cause you fight has government at its..." then he stopped me with a hand gesture, and said, humorously "sorry, but I have a pro-State gland".
That's right, while he was more polite than the average Reddit statist, he wouldn't even entertain a single question about it.
What does it tell you about a person who refuses to entertain a question, which -- say the statists -- should be "duhncredibly easy to answer"?
It tells you he's thinking "shut up about the question, I don't want to be bothered because I know I am wrong". Sometimes they'll deflect, sometimes they'll attack you, but the underlying primitive motive and mechanism is the same.
Which is a damn shame.
Richard will pass away having failed in pretty much every single evil he fought, because he never accurately identified the root cause of the evil. And he didn't, not for lack of intelligence, but for the standard 12-year statist brainwashing regime.
Damn shame.

"Taxes are due" as well when you buy or sell anything, regardless of what currency the transaction is denominated in.  For the purposes of calculating how much they will steal from you, they will use the legal tender equivalent of the transaction.

Furthermore, your continued attempts to pass off **unrelated stuff** (note to reader: see above, and *especially* see below\*) as *"evidence"* confirming your claim  have also destroyed any credibility I afforded you earlier when I asked you to support your claims.
I'm sorry to decide this unilaterally for you, but I won't be entertaining this conversation anymore.
\* In a reply to this comment, my interlocutor corruptly equivocates LD's claim (a) "Liberty Dollars are real money / currency" (verifiably true by anyone) as confirming his original claim (b) "Liberty Dollars claims their product is US currency".  While it's true that LD repeatedly claimed (a), it's clear that (a) does not prove (b), because "real money" and "currency" *do not mean* "US currency".  His "proof" of his lie is, as you all can see, simply deceit by playing fast with language.  This is the kind of thing that certain people, who are too **corrupt** to admit they were wrong and apologize, do.

Legally, the category matters. But not to worry, if government employees want to sabotage Bitcoin, they will distort any necessary words and invent any necessary lunatic theories to put Bitcoin in the worst category, so that they can apply existing and made-up laws to ruin it. If they need to say that water is dry in order to secure punishment against someone they perceive as a threat, rest assured they will do that. They have no shame.

See, nowadays the organized gangsters aren't just content with just ruining your life and extorting confessions (false or otherwise) out of you.  They **also** have to **smear** you, they have you **paraded** and your  mug **plastered** everywhere, for extra effect.
They have to do that, simply because *everybody already has wisened up*, and understands in one way or another that their bullshit "laws" and "crimes" are, well, *entirely made-up* and **without merit**.  And that is *not good* for their false frame of righteousness -- and therefore their control over us.
So they **have** to do shit like conspiring to get you to frame yourself in evil shit they masterminded.  And if that fails because you have rock-solid ethics, [**then they just plant child porn on you**](  Presto, they discredited you forever, even if you walk (but, chances are, you will die).
It's liike these criminals have **zero** conscience.  Everything they do is "good" if it helps them get their way.  You and I are mere pawns in their power tripping game.  It's all showbusiness, and as long as the cash keeps rolling in, and us idiots keep obeying, the gangsters will continue.

@_date: 2013-04-11 08:19:15


Thanks for your pointer.  I already know what that term means, because I examined what the term means in practice by observing reality.  Now I'm going to share my discovery, and why I believe that the concept you shared with me is actually a myth.  Whether you accept what follows or not, is entirely up to you.
The term is the non-Abrahamic equivalent of obedience of the "Ten Commandments", with the sole difference that the magical power of the papers in question is believed to come, not from Yahweh / Allah, but from "the people".  Just as superstitious a reification, of course.
They lie, of course, when they call this myth "Rule of Law", because it sounds less direct than "Rule of Men", which is what it really is, since the rules in the magical papers are in fact written by *men* and enforced by *men*, not by ghosts or computers.
Of course, *who* writes the orders and *who* perpetrates aggression against those who disobey, is irrelevant -- whether it be a "policeman" or a "feudal vassal", the act is observably the same thing and the contents of the paper do not alter reality -- they only alter *your perception* of whether the act is "just".  The papers are ultimately and solely a *mindfuck*.
Some people pride themselves in believing that obedience to one's preferred magical papers makes one superior to the "other savages over there".  Like in times when religion had more political power -- which ultimately means the power to murder those you disagree with -- many people used this as an excuse to murder those who didn't believe in their papers.
Many people still do.  270 million people, to be accurate, were murdered by people doing business as "government" who claimed to be "upholding" the contents of the magical papers.  Just in the 20th century.  Excluding wars.  All of them executed or starved under the auspices of "Rule of Law".


Actually, you probably don't know this, but the activities perpetrated in those places were / are entirely "lawful" (I believe that's the term for when an action is sanctioned by the contents of the magical papers).  They had / have magical papers, they were all [signed by their magical authorities]( and then they were dutifully obeyed by the believers in the papers.  [So was the murder of six million Jews as well]( in case you were wondering.
I can understand you not knowing this -- the people who write *your* magical papers probably want you to believe that your obedience is "better than those other bad people over there", which is why they told you "see, we have magical papers and they didn't".  But they really did, and people obeyed them.  All these murderers claimed to be working under the authority of a single magical set of parchments.  Historical documents are pretty hard to deny.
As far as mass murder, rape and pillage, the excuse "God told me so" is no different in ethical nature from the excuse "these papers said so".  The common thread is always that the zealots who believe in the magical power of these papers will ruin / cage / kill you if you disobey the papers, and then they'll say "whatever brutal things I did to you were not brutal, but good and just, because these papers said so".  Should be pretty obvious, just dropping that note here because I'm sure it can go unnoticed.


Ah, yes, the standard "freedom is slavery" doublespeak.  The general theme of this doublespeak is that being told what to do, and being punished if you disobey, equals freedom.  Unless you have been told to repeat this doublespeak a thousand times, it should be pretty easy to deduce that the sentence you quoted for me is the equivalent of "1 equals 0".
See, I, too, read 1984.
So, do you have a point or were you looking to persuade me of something in particular?  Honest question.

'Course they are.  If you don't park your money at the stock market / bonds / treasuries, they steal it from you through inflation.  You couldn't lend it for cash (they would throw you in jail).  You couldn't even buy precious metals for the longest of times (again, throw you in jail).  Force is quite literally used if you try to escape this economic system.
Then, enter Bitcoin.  Until Bitcoin, you were indirectly forced to undergo what I explained above.  And there's the prospect that, in the future, you will be again be subject to **force, quite literally,** if you use Bitcoin.
But feel free to say "bah, that's not force" (even though it literally is), or "bah, that's not gonna happen" (even though it literally happened for quite a few asset classes).  You just go right ahead and say that, because you'll feel your cognitive dissonance deflate through your pretty lie.

So you **know** what I meant when I said "force", but you *deliberately chose to respond* by using the word "force" in a *different* way, with a *different* meaning, and leaving your meaning *unstated / undefined*?
That's not very nice.
If I tell you "cat" and you know by "cat" I mean "domestic feline", and, knowing this, you reply to me using the word "cat" to mean "&lt;vague creature not necessarily a domestic feline&gt;"... how do you expect to *communicate with me*?  By reverse supernatural osmosis?
Some would say that you're knowingly and dishonestly trying to confuse people.
Frankly, if I was a girl, and you asked me for a date, with your behavioral priors (your tendency to mean weird things when you use simple words everyone understands, and especially your alarmingly vague concept of "force"), I would probably *not* date you.  After all, you might mean "I will possibly rape you" when you tell me "let's go on a date".  You might not even consider it "force".  And you might even say I consented to being raped.

Sorry, I don't want to be mean, but you're lacking information to reach
The conclusion you reached.
Bitcoin is designed to allow for cross-chain transactions (usable for e.g. verifiable deposits and withdrawals across "realms" of coins). In fact we already have a working proof in Namecoin. Either a deposit/withdrawal goes in both chains, or it doesn't.
Of course... What SD does with the deposit *after* it is deposited is a *different story, but they could steal your deposit today anyway, regardless of verifiability, so the blockchain does not protect you from "the clearinghouse disappearing" today, contrary to the impression you seem to have.
So the "very simple system" you envision using "solely one blockchain, or otherwise can't be done" is perfectly cascadeable and verifiable in a hierarchical fashion. No properties of the whole system change, whether it piggybacks on one chain or multiple ones.
Assuming, of course, that SD implements it properly (which they have an incentive because per-transaction fees will skyrocket otherwise, destroying their market). It is just an engineering man-hours question, not a trust question or a political question.
A request: Let the experts hash it out and please don't add any more "can't be done" noise to the debate. If you don't want to go to the North Pole, that's fine, but don't bog down those who are going there by saying "can't be done because I personally ignore how". It's not nice and it does not help anyone.

I did, sorry you missed it.


There is your explanation.


I did not say that.
  I said that a person who joins a corrupt organization must either be corrupt himself or will inevitably be corrupted by the other members.
Not rocket science.


Of course you would.
I am not surprised that you would call someone who disagrees with you (but you cannot refute) "crazy". 
Disqualifying facts ("politicians are corrupt and take bribes all the time") and conclusions ("that is how we know politics is always going to be full of corrupt and evil people") that your mind cannot integrate in its cult system, is going to resolve the cognitive dissonance.
At this point in your statist indoctrination, It's easier for you to believe that a corrupt person, who takes $5mill in special interest bribes, gives a shit about you. It's soothing, it fits your mental model of politicians-as-righteous-demigods, and it seems very truthy. I understand.
Thus, you call "crazy" because the alternative is admitting that you were so obviously deceived, out of a very simple reality, by so many people. I understand.
I honestly do, because I was you a decade ago.

Unless ecology is like a religion to you, the important question is this: Bitcoin mining pollutes **compared to what**?
Bitcoin mining pollutes to the tune of a microscopic millifraction of what your government pollutes when it bombs brown people. It pollutes less than paper money. It pollutes less than the banking industry. Short of going back to the stone age by abandoning all currencies and doing barter, Bitcoin mining pollutes effectively *nada*.

Actually, "money laundering" means whatever your rulers want it to mean (in general, as ordered by the cultists in black mumus), rather than what you imagine it to mean.
In general, the term "money laundering" has been used to describe various actions that only had **one** compound factor in common: *(a) the owner of that money (b) was using his money as he saw fit (c) without asking for permission (c) and / or snitching on himself*.
For example, if these robed cultists decide that you depositing $200 in cash three times in your bank account happens to be "structuring" (a form of "money laundering" according to them) because of whatever made-up crazy-ass perversion of plain English they want, say goodbye to your property, freedom and reputation.

And if that means he has to eat a bag of cocks, well, shiat, he'll for sure enjoy a nutritious protein-filled cylindrical meal of turgence and virility.
It bothers me, though, that you've let him pervert what's on your mind in regards to who is burdened with proof here.  You know better -- go backtrack on this conversation to revise that.  You know well that he doesn't need to read any books to learn reality -- he just needs to show some actual thinking curiosity.  Which he's not showing, and he's covering up with the lie that he allegedly looked it up and it's all "not true".


...and sometimes dogma.  I point out the dogma, and I refuse to be framed into a false discussion where the dogma is assumed true and I'm supposed to disprove it.  If I masochistically wanted to gorge on that mental cancer, I'd be subscribed to and That's not trade -- that's imposition.

Here is an example of a person who absolutely doesn't understand the fundamental concepts involved in voluntary exchange:


To reach the absurd conclusion that the buyer got screwed, he plays fast and loose with the state of reality at two instances in time: time t0 (the time of the hypothetical purchase) and time t1 (the time of the hypothetical price hike).
It *is* true that the buyer might *not* have made the purchase at t1 for X BTC.  Unfortunately for his theory, that says *nothing* about the buyer's decision to purchase *at t0* for X BTC.
The buyer didn't "get screwed": at time t0, he judged the item he was getting to be worth X BTC, he did indeed get the item which he had judged to be worth more than X BTC; there was no fraud, no "screwing" anyone, no deception whatsoever involved in the transaction.
Now let's apply this guy's reasoning applied to, say, questioning a suspect who presents an alibi for the crime he's being accused of.
Imagine that the prosecutor says "yes, it's true that the crime was committed at 1PM, and your story of being at the bar at 1PM checks out".  Now imagine that the prosecutor followed up with "...but you *weren't* at the bar at 1:30 PM, so that means you might have committed the crime".
How absurd would that be?  You would justifiably say that the prosecutor was insane for his not being able to discern that the state of reality at 1:30 PM isn't freely interchangeable with the state of reality at 1:00 PM.  You would probably even conclude that the prosecutor is acting with malintent.
Well, this absurdity is the level of absurdity of this guy's "explanation" of Bitcoin buyer's remorse.  This is how stupid people can be, when they want to be stupid.

You say that like it's bad to pay for things one uses.


You're paying for them today by being *forced* to pay for them, in most cases regardless of whether you ordered the service, or wanted the service, or consider that the service is good (I donno anyone who happily pays for the "services" of bombing brown children or caging people who had the "wrong" vegetation).
Now, last time I checked, this is usually called *extortion*, and a setup where this extortion happens habitually is called a *racket*.
Maybe *not being forced to pay for them* is a *good* thing.

Exactly.  I am stealtweeting this right now...  done BAM 
EDIT: I also replied to the mentally challenged bearded man directly on the post.  This is what I said.
This post shoud be titled "Paul Krugman hates BItcoin because he and his control freak poseurs will be out of their jobs if they can't defame Bitcoin in time".  It's a shame that his "Internet won't amount to more than the fax machine" diatribe from the 90's, somehow didn't have him replaced in the public eye with obviously more knowledgeable people.
When he speaks about "retrogression", he conveniently neglects to inform the people he is misinforming that generating Bitcoins consumes at least six orders of magnitude less resources than actually mining for metals or the entire banking industry whose boots he licks routinely. He also conveniently forgets to mention that the Bitcoin network -- unlike his rapacious buddies -- will in a few years completely stop spending any resources in producing Bitcoins, bringing an end to the very thing he complains about.
At best, he is ignorant of the topic he's speaking.  At worst, he is deliberately telling lies.
I swear to God, the only "retrogression" here is allowing Krugman to waste computer resources with his nonsense.  Allowing this individual to impress his hateful diatribes and character assassinations onto millions of people is as offensive to the general public as the very concept of venality.
Yes.  I registered an account on this rag just to say that.

People doing business as "Government" would hate what bitcoin does for fund expenditure transparency, because they rely on you being ignorant of what they squander the money into (bribes, favors, kickbacks, all official and legal but mostly out of the purview of pedestrians like you and me). Today, scandals tied to their embezzlements are the exception -- the bitcoin blockchain would make them the norm. Do you think they would accept that?
Also people d.b.a "Government" would hate bitcoin because they can't inflate if and they can't print / borrow it like they print / borrow paper money. Today, they can skim an extra 5% over the taxes they already steal from you or so via inflation. Bitcoin would put an end to that. Do you think they would accept that?
Criminals are criminals, and anything that might make their crimes harder to commit, they will inevitably fight.  *Bitcoin is definitely a force for good... and that is EXACTLY why people doing business as "government" will try their best to sabotage it.* Once they start trying to shut down bitcoin, you will get your most evident confirmation that these people are malevolent, contrary to what you and many others think today.

Thieves and advocates of thievery (like MarshallBanana) always feel the need to call decent people thieves, because the alternative would be to acknowledge that they have been rooting for obvious evil all along.
It is the standard reversal of ethics, no different than the abusive father who blames his outbursts on his children "look what you made me do", "I'm not a bad father, I just got shitty children". Or, for a more familiar example, the rapist defender who excuses the rapist's actions with the all too well known "bitch was asking for it".
There is no more potent hate than the hate of the unethical person, who knows he is unethical, projected against the decent person... because the decent person painfully reminds the unethical person of what he is not.
In sum: MarshallBanana is defending the indefensible (organized crime) by falsely accusing others of the very evils he supports. That is all that is happening here. Nothing else to see here, move along, people.
And yes, anyone who supports organized aggression against anyone for peaceful disobedience, is obviously corrupt, regardless of rationalization.

I am at a bar having a beer.
Right now, I don't exactly feel like explaining how these services can be provided but not at the barrel of a gun, or how those services cost a fraction of what you're forced to pay for brown children being bombed, starved and raped.
I also don't feel like proving to you that you're paying, not because you want or use these services, but because they'll terrorize you and your family if you don't.
And I don't feel like showing you that you automatically and involuntarily rationalize this insanity in complex ways, ways that were drilled into you by continuous NLP and threats when you were young.
So, you'll have to excuse me, but, eh, good luck with your beliefs. I won't attempt to persuade you. All I ask is the respect of not being terrorized if I disagree. Not too much to ask.

Haha! Nice sarcasm, I have to admit.  Unfortunately, everything you couched in your sarcasm is not true in my direct observational experience:
- Everything I have paid for has been *cheaper* or the same price with Bitcoin.
- Maybe you need to go to an exchange site to get cash for cupcakes, but my experience was diametrically different: 
- I've personally never had problems converting Bitcoin to fiat, *even when I was in a shithole third world country and I needed money*.  Oh yes, I needed fiat, I got fiat.  In the third world.  No 5% fee for foreign withdrawals.
- No one who accepts Bitcoin is obligated to accept *only* Bitcoin, so they do not need to narrow their market in any way -- on the contrary, accepting Bitcoin *expands* their market.  "Bitcoin accepted here", rather than "ONLY Bitcoin accepted here".
- Yes, transaction fees are cheaper for merchants.  That's probably why I got my electronics cheaper.
- It probably sucks to be you that you're overpaying $5 per bitcoin when you buy them.  Maybe you want to stop buying from bandits and use legit exchanges or reputable OTC sellers?
- Yes, credit cards are super inconvenient, because they are fundamentally insecure *for both parties*.  I have to give merchants information that allows them to charge me more than I authorized.  Merchants have to deal with the fact that I might just charge them back.  That sucks for everyone but the minters of the plastic rectangles.

Mating rituals are also inefficient, yet I bet you still dress nice and brush your teeth before you go on a date, right?
Same here, because the core issue comes down to **trust**.
Effort to generate trust may appear "inefficient" at first sight, but they are worth the expenditure, as all studied species have proven time after time.
Without this seemingly "inefficient" mechanism to generate trust, you end up with "real efficient" mechanisms to generate trust that aren't actually efficient at all, like PayPal (3% of your purchases) or "government" (250 million murdered excluding wars in the 20th century, plus 50% of your yearly work, how's that for slavery detractors, eh).

Well, if you make up your own definitions for words, like Hugo said, you can always be "correct"... you're just not communicating anything in English anymore.
People who make up their own words so they don't have to admit they are wrong appear to me as capriciously dishonest people who cannot revise their own beliefs. Intrinsic is a very well-defined word that has a specific meaning which you can consult in a dictionary.

Without a proper definition of "force" from you -- second time you had a chance, but you didn't do it -- I can't decode what you said.  And I won't try to guess.
Therefore, the closest interpretation of your "point" would be something like:


One of the variables is missing.  The claim can't be evaluated for truth by contrasting with observable reality, because the very thing we're supposed to observe, is undefined.  There's no point in your point.

Bzzzzt, wroooooong.  Sorry.  Haha!
Why did you think I asked the question?
I asked the question because you were not actually talking with me -- you were conversing with a sock puppet, a fiction entirely the product of your imagination, which you very prejudicially and rapidly projected onto me.  Here it is, in your own words, the sock puppet you invented to "debate":


See?  "Litttle", "rich seeing", "middle class" and "windbag", from a "stable" and "safe" country.  All adjectives I'm absolutely not, all shit entirely made up to rationalize your emotions towards me.  The only way in which you could have gotten me more wrong, is if you'd called me a "lady".
Now here's who I am and why you're wrong:
I am a only-recently-middle-upper class Latin American-born mestizo who came (from an incredibly corrupt and highly violent country called Ecuador) to the U.S. when I was 30 years old.  Before that, I was poor.  Not dirt poor, just poor.  Of course, now I work for a company whose services you probably use every day, but that's now.
In any case, I always knew poor *and* corrupt countries were better for the average person than just rich and corrupt countries -- here in the U.S. corruption can only be afforded by campaign contributors and lobbyists.
And yes, I have plenty personal experience talking what I'm talking about here -- specifically, how evil in corrupt countries can be protected against with money.  I was poor, don't get me wrong, but not enough that I couldn't slip a *sota* ($10) every once in a while to, say, prevent my car from being robbed ("impounded", you probably call it) by cops.  You just *have* to do that sometimes there.  It's a life skill, which your friends and family teach you.


Nah.  The "rule of law" is just for people who invent bad things about everyone else who doesn't share their belief system.  It's an invention so that the little people like you, who believe that fairy tale, can't pester the Big Boys while they engage in their Big Corrupt Leagues.
Oh, by the way, you may want to get that anger management issue checked out.  I was nothing but polite, yet you had no problem first making up random stereotyped shit about me, and then demeaning me.  Oh, and the time you flipped out to another complete stranger?  That one too.

LOL he says that bitcoin is a fiat currency because people have faith in it. Spelling fail, [doesn't know what the fuck fiat means]( and thinks it means faith. 
OK, settling this debate once and for all, by repeating something I said in a comment 20 levels deep, because I'm a lazy fuck **and** you deserve to be **informed** instead of misinformed about the nature of Bitcoin.
Here you go:
Here is the proposition everyone who is misinformed insisted upon, tacitly or explicitly.  My response to it follows.


Yes, some people -- fools whom I pity -- do believe that, because they are historically ignorant idiots who can't think well and confuse a currency being decreed legally with a currency being intrinsically worthless.
That is because these myopic idiots have only ever lived in a world where all fiat currencies are worthless, so these myopic idiots think these two categories are synonyms when they are in fact not synonyms at all.  Not having studied history before the 20th century -- probably not having studied history before CATV was invented -- they have zero knowledge that there were *many* countries throughout many millennia, where currency with intrinsic (use) value was actually **fiat** (literally decreed as legal tender).
Oh yes, this is historical fact.  As it happens, the very people who **invented** the term "fiat" **quite literally** made *gold* (money with intrinsic use value) **fiat**.  And, whaddya know, *most people today agree with these people*.
That is why the definition they made up is **first** in the Wikipedia article.  That is why Wikipedia's looser-than-a-prostitute's-vagina second and third order definitions for "fiat" are *second and third, not first*.
Who am I going to believe?  Idiots who can't think and can't be arsed to study history and etymology?  Random people on the Internet who argue vehemently, without historic or etymological knowledge, for secondary and even tertiary misdefinitions of a well-understood word?  Or the people who invented the word?
You guess the answer to that question.
Words are not arbitrarily interchangeable.  "Fiat" is not a synonym of "intrinsically worthless" as it is not a synonym of "debt-based".  They all have distinct definitions.  Look:
* Bitcoin is not a fiat currency -- it has never been decreed by any government as legal tender.
* Bitcoin (the address balances, not the technology) is intrinsically worthless -- it only has value because people socially give it value.
* Bitcoin is not debt-based -- no assets, real or otherwise, are borrowed in exchange for minting coins.
*These terms have specific, technical meanings.  Learn their meanings, so no one can bamboozle and deceive you when they talk to you about money.*

Comes with a built-in system to keep them safe, eh?
Reminds me of what I wrote a few months ago in the Dramatalk.org forums:
I just thought of something.
Bitcoin is really only the first step in protecting oneself from theft.  We can already see how this is too disturbing for statists not to react, sabotage or otherwise defame.  "You need a state to have money" has been refuted by reality.
But there will come a day when someone invents a personal protection shield that prevents you from getting shot, stabbed, beaten or caged.  It's really just a matter of time.
And then, you'll be able to protect yourself, not only from common criminals, but from organized criminals, including those who allegedly exist only to "protect" you.  They won't be able to attack you to get your obedience and your money.  "You need a state for protection" will have been refuted by reality too.
Can you imagine that, for just a second?
I can already envision the headlines in the mainstream media: "Terrorists use unauthorized protection devices", "Only The Government should be allowed to own protection devices", "Evil people evade good taxes with evil protection devices".  And the consequential demonization of anyone who buys, makes or sells one of these...
...proving beyond all doubt that government was never about protecting people.  It was about farming them.  Except it won't matter anymore, because these organized criminals won't be able to do a thing about it.
*That'll be the day when statists will literally lose their shit.*
Bitcoin is that personal protection shield for money.

The murderers, thieves and kidnappers who do business as "government" are a microscopic minority compared to everyone else. For cost reasons, going to each and every person's house to pilfer their belongings is a non-starter -- do it too little and you won't recover the costs of paying the mercenaries, do it too much and people start shooting back.
Due to this simple numbers factor, the only way they can effectively rob everyone is if (1) most people remain under the delusion that the thieves are righteous and their demands are legitimate (2) the rest of the people are kept under a tight leash whereby their economic activity is spied and inextricably tied to their identities in a totalitarian way, so they cannot escape the theft without attracting the attention of the criminals who know where they live and won't hesitate to kidnap them.
We see that (1) is going away (look at the approval ratings of political institutions. So what is left? (2), of course. As long as your slaves can fear your whip, they will continue to obey.
Except Bitcoin divorces identity from transactions (if used correctly). Suddenly, it becomes too costly for the criminals to track everyone's economic activity (in theory it becomes easier, but that's only true if the vast majority of the users leak their identities). Now the criminals can't just trust that people will dutifully report to tax slave central, and pay up on demand. They have to *actually terrorize* people.
And that looks bad. You see, "government works" only when it is **non-obvious** that ultimately you will get shot if you disobey. What "governments" do best is threaten people and terrorize those who disobey, while pretending that the threat is "not a threat", and their victims are to blame themselves. When they start shooting up and locking up too many of their tax cattle, the delusion fades and the cattle start identifying them for what they really are: just a bunch of violent cultist fucks.
Think about it: Just a mere 1000% increase in the level of legal terrorism would completely bankrupt the people that do business as "government", not to mention completely destroy any perception in the general public that the activities of the criminals have anything to do with "justice". Half a million people protecting their wealth from the thieves with Bitcoin, and it's game over for "government". Poof, the delusion reveals itself for what it really is: a bunch of dangerous sociopaths with guns and a penchant for stealing other people's stuff.
This is why Bitcoin is a game changer, and why you can expect people doing business as "government" to scramble in their attempts to control it and maintain their current power structure over the tax slaves.
They are preparing for this -- at least the "American" criminals  didn't buy three hollow point bullets for every "American" to use them as target practice. In their sociopathic minds, it's us or them, and trust me my man, you are not one of them.

Correct.  You see a group of people who would not hesitate to have you ruined / caged / assaulted / murdered if you resisted their orders, and you perceive their actions through their made-up feel-good propaganda of how "they want what's best for you" and "they are there to protect you".
Consequently, you perceive the world like a schizophrenic person.  You obey everything they say, but you pretend it's your own free will.  You see their terrorist actions against peaceful people and you immediately blame their victims and extol the "virtues" of their terrorism.  You see the hypocrisy, lies, and abominations they perpetrate, and it doesn't faze you because "it must be for some common good that you're too lowly to understand".
It's magical thinking thru and thru.  Your obedience and blindness is guaranteed by your own mind, because -- fundamentally -- these criminals own your mind.

Rai Stones worked as currency, there were no banks there, they had zero utility in their own right to anyone (they couldn't even be moved unless ten strong men tried), they just sat there like the dumb rocks they are.  All they were good for, is money -- fully functional, widely accepted currency.  Right there, Rai Stones are a perfect example of that which you believe to be impossible.

I am not scared of being called a "criminal", because all it means is I disobeyed some orders written in some pieces of paper by strangers who want to rob and subjugate me. It doesn't mean I am bad, vicious, immoral, or anything remotely related.
Obeying or disobeying orders has nothing to do with morality, so no, it is not a moral quandary in the slightest, except perhaps for those cultists who equate "immoral" with "disobedient". The word "criminal" is meaningless from an ethical standpoint, just like the words "infidel" or "sinner" are.
Thus, "criminal" is not an insult to me, nor does it scare me. Obedience to "the law" (just magical pieces of paper) may be important to you. It isn't to me. How you feel about that is not my problem.
The sooner you realize that, the happier you will be in your life.

Nice sleight of words.
He says Bitcoin is a "method"... by which -- oh, surprise! -- one can do *certain things common to all currencies*.
Which is, um, how to say this best... *an important detail*. He literally just described how Bitcoin fits the definition of a currency. 
If Bitcoin is a method to do all those wonderful things, and so is the dollar, and the euro, and gold, why does he deny the category of "currency" *to Bitcoin only?*
Why? Because he is a sophist who wants to deceive people about Bitcoin, so they won't adopt it. And a very easy way to deceive people about a thing X is to provide a deliberately slothful definition of X, which fails to inform people about important properties of X.
To make an example (of him), I am gonna do the same he did here, but to him. I am gonna claim, in the tradition of Plato, that Steven here is a *featherless biped*. Of course, all men are featherless bipeds, we understand that. But, you see, that doesn't mean Steven is a "man". Sure, he remarkably does share all "man" characteristics with every other "man"... but I think it's more "interesting" to call him a "featherless biped". Isn't it "interesting" when I categorize Steven slothfully? Why, yes it is!
I guarantee you one thing: if this featherless biped was a rapist, he may very well define rape as a "method"... by which one can introduce his penis into an orifice against the will of the owner of the orifice.
This is the kind of Orwellian shit that is the bread and butter of these criminals.

I posted about this yesterday.  The reason the way Bitcoin has to be purchased is a disaster, is because statism.
That machine you mention?   Highly illegal unless you get a shit ton of "permits".  Why aren't there more of those machines?  Because, if you put up one of them, someone claiming to "protect and serve" is gonna steal your machine and take you to a cage.
What about more exchanges?  Again, you need to get millions of dollars in "permits".
What about easier ways to move money into exchanges electronically?  Nope.jpg, statism has made sure that there are very, very few ways, most of them involving lots of fees and none of them involving privacy.
The whole situation is 100% an unintended consequence of the "regulation" that so many people worship like it's God's own lube.  And, as it often happens, the people who *do* manage to set up a business in this legal-terrorist environment, they are the ones that are blamed by the public.  No one *ever* blames the politicians.

You can see how he could have an interest in epistemically destroying economic knowledge.

You didn't go to "civics class"?  You weren't threatened with "bad grades" (and the consequences thereof) if you didn't parrot all the "good stuff that government does for you" on the tests?
Great for you.
The rest of us was told explicitly and led to believe implicitly, over the course of twelve years, that there is a magical entity, fully invisible, which was created "by the will of the people", divided into three holy branches, which authorize a small group of people to do exceptional, "necessary and good" things that, committed by anyone else, would be *just wrong*.
Such as, for example, kidnapping is wrong, but if you are a "government agent", it's "not kidnapping" because it's called "arrest", and it's virtuous.  Or mass murder, which is just plain wrong, but if you are a "soldier", then it's "not mass murder" but "war" which is much necessary, and don't you know they do it to protect your freedoms.
Attending these ceremonies was *mandatory*, and there was punishment if we didn't prove that we could memorize all the attributes of ~~the holy trinity~~government, its ~~magical Commandments~~laws, how those who refuse to obey the ~~Commandments~~laws are ~~sinners who must be sent to Hell~~ criminals who must be sent to rape cages, and ~~how everything would turn to Judgment day when people cease believing~~how necessary the entity is for peace and love.    There is literally no element of this cult you subscribe to, that cannot be mapped to a legacy monotheist cult.  Even "treason" maps to "being faithful to another God".
And so, the rest of us were trained to be terrorized of the punishment that representatives of this entity were authorized to dole out (up to and including *death*, if you resist them with force), thus training us into unquestioning obedience of their ~~Commandments~~laws.  And we were also trained to call that ~~"love"~~"allegiance".
They even made us chant mind-numbing prayers to a cloth.  How **cultish** is ***that***?
Now, where I come from, that's bona fide indoctrination, and if the Christians were forcing people to undergo this today, it would cause everyone to rise up in rage.  But, since it's *government* which does the indoctrination, I guess it's "not indoctrination".  Remember, when "government" does something that would be bad for anyone else to do, they call that thing by a different name and pretend it's virtuous.  This thing, they call "education"
However, don't get me wrong.  I take your word at face value and I presume you were exempt from this brainwashing.  I suppose you'll now share with us *how* you came to worship Godvernment, if not by being forced to repeat its theological dogma like the rest of us was.

I don't think that's what we're discussing here.  Whatever FinCEN or any other criminal organization *says* "is law", is really *just a bunch of written opinions* that are only "special" in three ways:
1. They are enforced at the point of a gun.
2. They benefit the criminals who enforce these opinions, and their friends.
3. They are worshipped as truth and virtue by most people, exactly like fundies worship Scripture.  Why?  Because, as explained by (1), the consequences of not worshipping the opinions to the point of blind obedience range from social ruin, to economic ruin, to kidnapping, to death.
Try walking into any place and telling strangers, friends or family that "the law is just a bunch of opinions, and I'm not going to obey it any more".  I guarantee you, they will look at you like you're crazy, and some may possibly offend you or even assault you.  Which is exactly what you'd expect if you walked into a Jehovah's Witnesses meeting and expressed the same conclusion of their Holy Book.

This isn't evidence. This is just redefining the word "slavery" (which has a very specific and concrete meaning) to childishly whine about the perfectly normal fact that people need stuff to survive.  That is not an argument - it's just more of your specious Daddy theory of Wealth, where you want things to be free, and you think that the way to get there is to destroy any means to compare and evaluate worth.
It seems that you don't even understand what evidence means, since you can't provide it when asked for it - you just produce more unproven claims.  I bet I could literally sit here all week and respond to every statement you've made with "how do you know that?" and you would never produce a shred of actual proof that demonstrates you actually know any of the stuff you claim to believe in.

@_date: 2013-04-12 17:09:49
Your definition of "Rule of Law":
1. It is a state of affairs where the official behavior of government is precisely defined and codified.
2. This codified behavior is accessible to the wider public.
3. The behavior of the government reflects the codified doctrine. It must be beneficial to civilians to know the law, whether they intend to obey it or not, due to it's usefulness in predicting the behavior of government.
4. Accused civilians are given a fair trial, as a utility to weed out the false positives that inevitably occur.
5. Retroactive laws are not permissable
As far as I can see, *all these conditions* held in the Soviet Union, hold in North Korea, and held in Nazi Germany.
So your earlier conclusion that the USSR and North Korea "don't have Rule of Law", is, as far as I can see, completely unsupported.
Now, if we're to accept that what happened in those geographic regions under alleged "Rule of Law" was / is *flat out evil*, then the conclusion you shared even earlier (that "Rule of Law is" somehow "a beneficial belief to have faith in"), sorry, but I obviously just can't believe or accept that conclusion.  You see why, right?
This is why I said "Rule of Law" is really (1) *rule of men*, with additional bureaucratic steps of (2) writing orders in papers and (3) performing rituals to "sanctify" these papers.

That which you call an "opinion" is an observation of their actual behavior and actions, id est, *a statement of fact*.
I understand that it irritates you when you see me call a spade a spade, but calling facts "opinions" only shows that *you distort reality whenever you evaluate what the criminals do, and give them the special treatment of pretending that, when they rob, it's not robbery*.
TLDR: **no, what I wrote is not "just, like, my opinion, maaaan".**


"Society" also *decided* to murder Jews en masse, to pretend the Earth is flat, to enslave Negroes, and to rape children.  Those **opinions** (*not facts*), based on the absurd **belief** that small groups of people were "special" (the same belief wrecking your own brain right now), have caused terror and death to the tune of hundreds of millions of people.
So **I don't give two shits** about what your "society" has "decided" (translation: terrorized into believing against the evidence of their senses).  You can take your "societal *opinions*" and shove them up "society's" ass.

**NO. Don't lie to my face.** 
You don't "love my naiveté". Especially *not sincerely*. Your comment is in fact laden with insincerity and passive aggression.
I thought reasoning with you was a worthwhile effort. What do I get for my trouble? I get insults from you.
Yes. Insults. You just insulted and disrespected me by calling me naïve. There is absolutely nothing "loving" or "sincere" about insulting and trying to humiliate me in response to my shared idea.
All you do by resorting to bullying and leveling, is demonstrate that you have no arguments to refute the fact that decent non-abused people don't resort to organized aggression to resolve their disputes.
Now listen attentively to this: Your parents may have shut you up by calling you naïve. If that is the case, too bad that happened to you, your parents were manipulative assholes, and you were too young to protect yourself against their malicious behavior. But you are not going to play hot potato with that psychological dingleberry by passing it onto me, or passing it as an argument for anything.
I'm not going to get angry at you for your reflexive outburst. But you just lost any credibility you may have had with that underhanded trick of yours. It is up to you to finish your incipient tantrum, or to switch to reason and evidence. Maybe then I will respond to any valid arguments you may have.

I suppose you're 100% entitled to demand that *you* be restricted in how *you* can use your money, but *I don't want* to have any of that shit imposed on me, so *stop groveling in my name*.  You're fucking shit up for me and many others.  You and I may agree on some issues, but that doesn't mean you're allowed to demand that *I* be punished for using my money in certain ways.

These shows are always propaganda for the status quo.  It's the way that political agendas are implanted in this century -- when the receiver's brain is in a "low power state", it's wayyyy easier to grease the cocks of propaganda into their ears.  Just one of these things that's used to terrorize people into fearing things that threaten the cultural mythology.
Note how *even your interlocutor* falls for the propaganda, when he says "unfortunately" when referring to an illegal organ transplant.  Why, exactly, is it "unfortunate" that someone bought an organ, so long as it was obtained peacefully?  And, if it wasn't obtained peacefully, how is it ethically relevant whether the purchase of the organ is "legal"?  If the organ was stolen, then that's wrong, whatever the law says.  If the organ was sold peacefully, then that's okay, whatever the law says.

imahotdoglol always defends any action taken by the people who do business as "government".  For example, if they steal your money, he'll say that it's because "you must have done something wrong", so it's "perfectly justified" for them to steal your money.
How does this "reasoning" come about?  Well, his core belief is that everything these criminals do is virtuous or, at worst, necessary.  Why?  Not because of the intrinsic ethics of their actions, but rather because of their membership in the said criminal gang.  Of course, whenever he is confronted with behavior that demonstrates the criminals are callous in their disregard about human life and welfare, his cognitive process distort his observations enough that he can blame the victims of the criminals / explain away the criminals' behavior.  It's all about the back-asswards reasoning from his preconceived conclusions, and never about admitting that the criminals just *might* be acting brazenly criminally, hypocritically, callously, sociopathically.
So, for example, in response to the proposition that the criminals are clearly not interested in the slightest about delivering actual justice, his participation consists on saying "ah, overly simplistic view".  This is, surely you recognize, one of the standard meaningless replies that people use to put into question the proposition without actually refuting said proposition.  Apparently, the issue of making justice is "complicated".  But *how* exactly is it complicated to punish wrongdoers in order and proportionally to their wrongdoing... well, you see, ***that*** **he inexplicably leaves unsaid**.

"That's the way it's going to be" is probably one of the most popular forms of tax-cow speak.  His belief that only "governments" can make something "legitimate" is another one of the tax slave dogmas, of course.
This is why I say that people are exposed to a constant stream of mind-warping statist propaganda -- tax slaves echo it to each other, in this echo chamber of defeatist dogma.
One of the "best" forms of propaganda -- which you can see here at play -- is to **speak of something that is false under the assumption that it is true**.  For example, when you adopt statist language that assumes the existence of "government" and the ultimate righteous authority of "law", you yourself are brainwashing yourself and others into total obedience to those who *claim* to be "working for government" and *claim* to be "upholding the law".  When, in *observable reality*, what you can see is:
* A bunch of *dogma-induced sociopaths* who believe that they are entitled to write their *opinions* (law) and then terrorize everyone else into *obeying* their opinions, and believe that this activity, which would ordinarily be considered **dangerous violent schizophrenia**, somehow becomes "not schizophrenia", and even righteous, because of an invisible entity called "government".
* A much larger bunch of people who just believe and obey whatever the sociopaths say.  If these sociopaths say "Here our piece of paper says that MtGox is a money transmitter, so they must snitch to us on all their clients", people just don't question that.  The brainwashing makes this magical opinion into "the law", perceived as inevitable as the "you shall stone bratty kids" in Ten Commandments was just a few centuries ago.  And those who resist the opinion, quickly find themselves ruined, and quite possibly looking into a dungeon of rapists and murderers.
That's the world you live in.  This is why I make a *conscious effort* trying to *separate* what's collective delusion from what's observable fact, and *verbalize* the differences that way.  Guys with guns and delusions of omnipotence: reality.  "Government"": fantastical entity, nearly always used to **excuse** the activities of the delusional guys, and give them exceptional worship / treatment.
I've often asked people to *show me the factual differences* between a "policeman enforcing any law" and a crazy armed and costumed gunman imposing his opinions written somewhere.  **People never have answered this question**.  They get angry, they get belligerent, they get incredibly anxious, they dodge the question, they leave, *but they never answer*.
That's because there **isn't** any observable difference -- the only single difference is a difference in **perception**.  Their cognition is *warped by dogma* to see the costumed guy, not as the crazy and dangerous individual he is, but as a "righteous savior of society", *regardless of how malevolent his actual actions are*.
This is dogma-induced brain malfunction.

As always chalash brings a controversial idea, one that even I would prefer to the current state of affairs.
Unfortunately this noble idea crashes directly in the face of what government really and observably is and does.
See, people perceive government as some sort of benevolent protector who knows best and will protect them from evil. If that was truly the case, such an institution would have no problem with, and in fact would *lead*, the democratization you suggest.
But government in reality -- as opposed to its subjects' perception -- is actually a vast institution of total control, whose primary purpose is to extort work and obedience from everybody, and squash anyone who resists it.
The simple reality that government lovers just cant deny, which proves their delusions about benevolent government utterly false: People who care about you, don't treat you like their slave, or punish you when you refuse to obey them. And we have countless examples of what happens to the people who disobey government, down to the most basic one: you stop when the costumed man flashes you, because if you don't, *you gonna be ded*. That is *not* a person hired to "protect" you, and you know it full well.
The whole point of having a government is so that a tiny minority can maintain the power to have everybody obey their orders, which includes stealing trillions and spending it on shit people dislike and shit that is outright mass murderous and evil. You work, these people profit. You disobey them, these people have you anywhere from ruined to a splat on the floor. These are sociopaths and they work for the common cause of farming you.
Now, OP: do you understand that your idea would leave these psychopaths unemployed and without trillions of dollars to spend on their whore wives and corrupt friends? (I suspect you do).
In other words: your idea will never come to pass, because the very people who profit from the current state of affairs, are the people with the power to sabotage your idea, and the wherewithal to have anyone who attempts it STFU'd by way of murder or caging.
Of course, all the government lovers will give you tens and tens of excuses as to why your idea to reform government will result in "utter disaster I tell you", and how it will never work, et cetera. But the real reason they will oppose your idea to reform government, is because they know very well what government really is about -- after all they stop for cops too -- and they know in their bones that *executing your idea will expose, inevitably, what government is really about*.
And that is the very Thing No One Must Ever Point Out.

There are plenty of proposals by plenty thinkers aimed at solving these problems.  Fundamentally...


...I do see this being effective.
We don't have to agree.  We can both coexist, so long as you and I respect each other.
For example, I think that nobody should punish you for paying an organization called "government" to get the services they peddle.  I think you should be free to pay them, and obey them, if you so choose willingly.
Of course, this must go both ways.  So, all I want is for people like you to extend me the same benefit of *not being punished* for not wanting to pay for said services, and choosing a different service provider, or no service at all, or choosing to provide the same services that "government" provides.
I think this isn't much to ask.  I think every reasonable individual would have no problem with this truce.
But, *if you're not willing to extend me this same courtesy I extend you*, then it's clear that you want me harmed *simply for not believing the same things* you believe in.
If your ultimate position is that, if I don't share / accept / obey your beliefs, you're willing to have me ruined / thrown in a cage / assaulted / killed for resisting your organization... then you're not debating at all.  *You're just being antisocial*, and you're using this "debate" as a smokescreen for what you really want -- to *dominate and enslave me to your beliefs and wants*.


...which is loot...


...yes, for sure, when the robbers are disempowered to rob, the people who profit from their loot have to find a different way of life.

No, false, not anywhere. The ratio of elected politicians' lies to actual things that change, is shit *everywhere*.
If you got a burger only half the time you ordered one, but you were forced to pay every time regardless, you would not in your wildest dreams call this state of affairs "working". But you do say that such a state of affairs means "working" when it comes to the thieves that you vote for.

It is shocking to discover the nonchalance with which these people speak of stealing the common man's money, effectively retroactively enslaving him for as long as he worked to get his stuff.
In any other context, a man contemplating his associates stealing stuff from anyone who resists, would be immediately identified as a dangerous Mafioso, a malevolent degenerate, a serious threat to the well-being of everyone else.
But when it's the *government* doing the robbery... oh, suddenly all the rules flip upside down, atrocities sound decent and even virtuous, and suggesting this may be wrong is met with vile attacks, contempt, "how dare you even think that?", hate, and fogging.
"...the government could come and take all of the coins..." if people are contemplating it, it's because it's possible. Be prepared.

Ridiculing someone's formatting is usually followed by a shitty non-argument.  Otherwise you wouldn't need to use ridicule as a way to bolster your shitty position.  Let's see.


Aha.  Here is the shit.
That's only *circumstantially* true today.  When gold was accepted **by decree** (=**fiat**) as legal tender, gold was fiat currency.
Learn to apply definitions before disputing conclusions based on those definitions.


No, the definition of "fiat" isn't "someone issues them", so you can't say "X issues Y as currency, ergo X is fiat".  Your sloppy and self-serving "reasoning" shows.

Some of you are not capable of recognizing evil even when it's kicking your teeth out of your mouth, or bombing millions of people.
Some of you are simply not salvageable from your Livestockholm Syndrome.
So all we ask is that, if you want, you can continue to kill yourselves with your worship for evildoers, just leave the rest of us the fuck alone, cos we want no part of your self-destructive dogma.
Live and let die. Isn't mysterious or a tall order to ask.
But you won't. You want us to be punished -- caged or ruined or brutalized or killed -- for not sharing your absurd beliefs, not obeying your malevolent rulers, not falling for the irrational doublethink of "evil good" and "you don't understand maaaaan, stuff isn't black and white, but obedience of orders is always black and white, and if you disobey, fuck you".
You're not happy with live and let die. No. You want me (and millions of others) obedient or dead.
Despite your incoherent protestations, your intolerance is what's evil. Your intolerance is what affords organized murderers and robbers the resources and the license to perpetrate evil. You are to blame.

Correct.  The conclusion of the article is false.  The reason the author arrived at the wrong conclusion is simple: the author reasoned under the *unstated premise* that governments act honestly, instead of relying on subterfuge, deceit, and calculations of the political cost of inflicting terror.
Once we take that into account, the correct analysis is: if the people who do business as "government of China" wanted to sabotage Bitcoin, they would sabotage Bitcoin in the way that is *the cheapest to enforce and most politically expedient (read: treacherous)*... and this way just happens to be *sabotaging exchange* by *punishing exchanges and banks who take RMB deposits*.
This course of action is much less likely to cause widespread resistance than just a blanket ban on Bitcoin, because it's very much obviously cheaper and easier to terrorize a handful of people with *lots* to lose, than it is to directly terrorize 1300 million people who each comparatively don't have that much to lose.
Lo and behold, that's exactly what they did.

For those of you who don't believe this, you should know that the criminals doing business as "USCIS" can kidnap and return you to your country of origin  for any reason, real or imagined.  If they say you're carrying an illegal anus, they'll get your anus.
About a year ago, I helped a ~70 year old lady in the Norman E. Mineta airport find her family while I waited for my father to come visit me.  She was exclusively-Spanish speaking, diabetic, held hostage for hours, beaten (I saw her fucking bruises in her arms), denied insulin, interrogated futilely about her allegedly expired green card, all perpetrated by these criminals, and she was very confused, obviously.  For two hours I jumped around the airport inquiring how we could find out her son's phone number -- we eventually found someone from the airline who would give it to us -- illegally, for some retarded reason that I'm sure makes sense to the fucks who conjured that law into  existence  -- then called him from my phone, then waited until he showed up with his wife.  That day I cried to my dad when I saw him, glad to see him okay, yet in abject powerlessness for not being able to help that lady more.
I've seen how malevolently low and vile these scum can be, how they feel about everyone else not themselves -- we're trash to them, and if they want to use violence or steal your shit, no problemo cos they can get away with it, full impunity -- especially against defenseless people.  So I have no trouble believing OP.  If OP says he was deported for carrying an illegal flower in his ass that allegedly talked out of its own ass, I believe him barring evidence to the contrary, because I've seen with my own eyes how retarded, evil and self-righteous these scum are.

By my reasoning (not "logic", logic is not "mine") you would be correct, both are concepts rather than physical objects and, as such, don't exist. So?
Physicists don't need to explain the nonexistence of concepts, for the same reason they don't need do explain the non wetness of love: in criticizing my reasoning, you've obviously miscategorized concepts and objects. Physics doesn't cover everything, and it does not need to either, however you are still  categorically mistaken.
I don't fault you for this mistake, by the way. Almost no one gets a classical education anymore, so those of us who know these rather obvious truths, had to *go out of our way to learn it* and caught a lot of hate in doing so. 
There is a reason why nobody learns this stuff:
Why would worker drones need to know what the difference between existence and nonexistence is? Workers just need to obey, period. If they are told that love exists, the expected answer from them is "yes, love exists". Can you imagine the anger of ~~parents~~politicians who never expected their little Johnny coming home from school and questioning ~~the existence of God~~the omnibenevolence of politicians?
Therefore, schools teach obedience and avoid teaching anything controversial like the meaning of existence, or basic non-doublethink ethics. Because a thinking person who can tell he is being bullshited is no good for those in charge.

I am sorry that you got scammed,  but that doesn't refute my rebuttal. 
Regardless of fraud there, BTCJam is still proof positive that loans happen with Bitcoin.
And there are other examples of loans being done in Bitcoin (one of them right here in Reddit).
So the claim that Bitcoin somehow impedes loans is proven false by reality. 
One simply cannot argue against reality. If one insists "X cannot be done"  all the while someone is doing X, the word that most appropriately describes one is "delusional". If the theory says one thing and reality does another, the theory is wrong. 
Period. 
Among Bitcoin's accomplishments,  we can now count the ultimate disproof of the idiotic theory of Keynes Iran's about deflationary currencies impeding credit. Fuck yes.

Your interlocutor engaged with a reasoned argument as to how UBI isn't compatible with Bitcoin.
Instead of reasoning about the conclusion he shared, or asking questions about the topic to clarify doubts, you change the topic and ask him a facetious question about him.
Tell us: what the fuck does it matter what he politically believes, to answer the question of whether UBI is compatible with Bitcoin?
The answer is: it doesn't matter, either that claim is right or it is wrong, and whatever he believes in his skull is irrelevant.
You're just asking the question because you want to ridicule and attack him for what he believes. You don't want to get to the truth - you just want to cling to your nonsensical beliefs and shut down everyone else.

From another comment of mine:
You are right that Bitcoin allows people (who know how to use it) to remain anonymous, and therefore to protect themselves from organized theft.
You are right that the thieves, whose "job" is facilitated by their full access to your money, will be very angry at that, will call such acts of self-defense scary names like "tax evasion" and "counterfeiting", and will attempt to terrorize people into obedience. Obviously. They're career thieves with a false pretense of legitimacy trying to impose their opinion on you that "your money is theirs", why wouldn't they prevaricate, false-moralize and attack their victims?
You'd be right to say that public opinion might side with the thieves, at least at first. The public mostly believes that the organized criminals are a sort of "collections agency" that they live in fear of. This should come as no surprise -- the thieves "educated" everyone; why wouldn't the public parrot everything they were "taught"? They already had to parrot that same dogmatic nonsense under pains of bad grades when they were kids, and still endure frequent cultish refreshers through TV news. Repetition cements a lie.
In sum: People want to protect their money, and thieves will call that "theft". It's always been like that. In other words: Statists gonna state.
But, for the first time in history, you can now succeed at protecting your money, regardless of the thieves' loud protestations and criminal opinions.
What I fail to see is, how is that a problem? I think that's a great thing!
See, they can't terrorize whom they can't find. And even if they terrorized you, going to a cage while knowing you would have your money when you get out, is a completely different story from being caged knowing you'll be broke when you get out.
Now, that won't change the thieves' opinion that your money "belongs to them"... until people discover that, by golly, they too *don't have* to obey the thieves anymore... then so many people refuse to fund the thieves, that they go broke and their ability to terrorize their victims is nil.

Excellent comeback.  I would personally have come back with "If ten men rape a woman and then say it's not rape, then the rape was probably not rape."  That would have packed quite a punch as you revealed his selective solipsism for the nonsense it really is.
Note how *he himself* uses the term "illogical" and the term "retarded", both concepts implicitly requiring a concept of truth *vis a vis* logic and observable reality that is *at odds* with his tacit / explicit solipsist conception of it.  This evidences that he himself hypocritically *says* but *does not believe* "if everyone believes X, then X is true".  At least, not for *his* own claims -- you see, when *he* makes a claim, it's "true" because "many people make it true by believing in it"... but when *you* make a claim, it is "retarded" and his made-up "criterion of truth" does not apply.
In other words, he is a disrespectful hypocrite who is lying to you with really, really, really shitty sophistry.  Shit like this is very easy to spot -- when your asshole interlocutor starts attacking the very concept of truth to defend the bullshit he is saying, you have him on the ropes already -- all you have to do is point it out.

Hahahaha.  Fool.  Here's just one way in which the "super smrt" plan you outlined can pan out:
* You buy your coins from Coinbase or whatever other service with AML/KYC requirements.
* You then use the mixing service a year afterward.
* Then you move out of the country.
* Then you renounce your citizenship while abroad.
* They do a database search on your name, discover the coins you bought are subject to their claims of Exit Tax.  Yes, they know everything about you, from what car you drive, to how much money you made, to almost everything you spent that money into.
* When it's time for your interview to renounce your citizenship, they ask you if there is any financial or tax evasion reason for renouncing your citizenship.
* You, confident in the idiotic belief that "they can't prove I have the coins, ergo I am safe", say nothing and refuse to speak on the matter.
* Then they ask you about the coins they found in their search, why you haven't reported them, and whether you still have them in your possession.
* At this point, they know that you are hiding assets from them.  *They don't need to know whether you've laundered them (which is a crime unto itself), they don't need to know whether you still have them (and are hiding them, which is another crime)*, all they need to know is they have probable cause to believe that you bought coins, that you are not reporting them (yes, you are legally required to snitch on yourself about your assets when you're abroad), and therefore they are now *sure* that you are committing at least **one** crime.
* This is how shit goes down from this point on: only is your citizenship renunciation *refused*, you have now established probable cause for the crime of tax evasion.
* If you are in the embassy, they arrest you.  If you are not in there, they start extradition proceedings against you.
* Your moronic ass is fucked.
So, unless you bought strictly via cash, and you are prepared to explain away your cash-vanishing habits in a credible and irrefutable way, and you never tainted the balances of the addresses you had by spending them in ways traceable to you... you are really fucked.  You need to find a country with no extradition treaty to the U.S. (all shitholes, I checked) and hope that you won't ever be kidnapped from that shithole and dragged back to the U.S.  And, of course, you can never ever return again.

All your Bitcoin purchases above a certain threshold get reported automatically to FinCEN.  *They know.*


*Doesn't matter whether you mix them or not* -- what they need to know is that *you acquired the assets* (which they do, as they have records unless you bought them for cash), and that you paid your exit tax on the basis of that acquisition, or that you paid your capital gains tax on the profit basis of you having sold them before you renounced.
And no, telling them "Oh, I was robbed of them" won't work for you, like it doesn't work for anyone else using any other asset vehicle to escape the criminals.  You think you're the first person ever to concoct such a transparent lie?  You think the people who will kneecap you for not paying your blood money *care*?

A jury (composed of statists) will see the donation with hate and envy ("How can this man have so much money that he can afford to give it away?

At least one jury has convicted a woman who did exactly that.
 Yes, juries will see benevolence and interpret it as evidence of evil because the person sitting in the accused's bench didn't play by the orders in the magical papers.

The essence of your argument is that (a) the technocrats' public, verifiable and observable decisions that directly debase the value of your money somehow inexplicably don't influence your decision to spend, and that (b) Jeffrey Tucker wrote crazy shit.
To the first point: learn some economics. The technocrats' decisions to devalue your money make you less likely to save. They don't "predict" what is going to happen to your money -- they ENGINEER and RIG money to get you to do what they want.. You are not going to coves the Sun with your thumb here, and walk away like you made an obvious point.
To the second point: you need to start respecting your intellectual superiors, the people who can teach you something in pretty much every area of what it means to be human, from how to shave to how intellectual poverty is ruining the world, to how to be optimistic in the worst of circumstances. Even mentioning the word "crazy" in connection to Jeff is OFFENSIVE to intelligence itself. Not because he is a God, but because he could very well be a God compared to you.

It was fun watching the Staazi get smacked down.

Behind all that smoke and mirrors scene they usually build, all the "laws" and "justice" and "welfare" and "safety", all the fallacious arguments they invent, the simple and undeniable truth remains: when you don't agree with the statist, **the statist wants your obedience or your death**.

This is strictly false, as in "reality does not bear this belief".  "Money laundering" can and does refer in many instances to using money that was perfectly legally obtained, hiding no traces whatsoever of no activities legal or otherwise, just not in a way that is approved or known to the thugs who decreed "that's money laundering".  Many people have had their lives ruined for using their perfectly legally obtained money under this malevolent "money laundering" bullshit.
But even if it were true -- it isn't -- *so what*?
No, really, *so what*?  So fucking what if the money you're using has been declared "illegally obtained", because you sold some "wrong" vegetation, or sold some "wrong" lobsters, or sold your gold / car / speakers and didn't report it?  Does that make it *okay* to steal that money -- which is yours -- from you, or to hold you in a cage until you prove the money is yours?  Does that make it okay to terrorize with threats of punishment, to give you a permanent record that will likely make you unemployable and a pauper for the rest of your life?
No, of course not.  But that's what "money laundering" really does to decent people.  If you support that, you fit the definition of sociopath for your openly callous disregard of human life and welfare.   "It couldn't happen to me because I am an obedient boy" won't wash that away.
If you're interested in understanding how big of a crock of shit this whole "money laundering" fearmongering is, [here's Grabbe telling it to you from his grave](  But if your interest is to terrorize decent people who haven't done anything wrong -- compare to "illegal" -- then I'm afraid you're not going to terrorize me.

The term "money laundering" has such horrible "sinner" connotations for what really is just **transferring your money without permission or knowledge of your rulers**.
It's just terrible and appalling to live surrounded by what effectively amounts to slaves, children inhabiting adults' bodies, who just swallow it wholesale, the notion that it's somehow "terrible" that people **might want to use what is theirs** without having to consult with Master.
A way to regain this notion of "mine, don't you steal or punish me for peacefully using it", is **exactly what Bitcoin enables and was engineered to deliver**. If you, dear reader, don't approve, GTFO of Bitcoin and stick with the banks. Go cry to your banker when your Cyprus arrives.

I believe what the author means is that fractional reserve banking cannot develop *within the Bitcoin system of transfers and the blockchain*.
Outside of it, of course it can. It is hard to imagine but *certainly plausible* that people might accept Bitcoin *substitutes* backed by fractional deposits.

Like I said, clearly you can't fit Bitcoin in your head, because the statist mythologies of "inflation goooood deflation baaaad" are taking all the space in your brain, preventing you from absorbing new and useful knowledge.
Regardless, your question was whether Bitcoin is desirable. That is, whether people desire it.
Thus, to figure out whether using Bitcoin was a good idea, *we do not need to look at your opinions* on what attributes a currency *ought* to have. *We only need to watch* whether people desire Bitcoin or not.
Turns out they do. Numbers don't lie. Despite all your bitching, people desire Bitcoin more and more with each passing day. Your religious dogma notwithstanding, people observably prefer deflationary money over inflationary money.
"Who'd a thunk it?" you may ask. The answer is obvious to those "retards" among us who have shed your religious myths. The alleged advantages of your inflationary money are irrelevant -- the only think that counts is reality: what happened to *your* money and what happened to *ours*. No argument and no insult of yours can undo or mask that.

So you (implicitly but) openly admit that you were wrong when you said the securities were "unregistered" and "unregulated", and you admit that the securities are indeed registered with MPEX and are subject to MPEX's stated regulatory policies.
Next time, to avoid looking like a fool and eating your own words, be specific when you speak -- if you say "unregulated" but what you really mean is "regulated by people other than this gang of criminals I worship", then say so.  Otherwise you end up looking like a fool... like you do now.

The propaganda in that article is so obvious. How they try to seed the idea that the people who are about to be robbed are "criminals", how badly the "oversize" banking sector is portrayed, how this mass theft is the definition of virtue and holy savior. It's just...
Meanwhile the corrupt politicians who negotiated this theft, and their close friends, are safe from it. They all moved their shit out where it can't be robbed, as reported by minority independent media. That was totally predictable to someone like me, who already lived this scenario a decade ago. These are the real criminals, but they won't be punished. Robbery for thee, but not for me.

Dude, are you having trouble with reality?  My company just launched an "initiative", in a coalition with many other companies, to "stop" government spying.  You may have heard it.  It was in the news.
Together, all these companies control over a *trillion dollars*.  There is a 99.99% likelihood that, in the last 24 hours, your Web browser loaded a file from a server belonging to one of these companies.        Our stuff is *literally* in your browser cache.
You know where the "initiative" is going?
You know why?
Because the initiative is based on the same premise as your post: **that groveling to thugs changes their behavior**.
The premise is **fucking wrong**.  Therefore failure.
What do **you** think that you have, that these companies lack, to make **your** initiative work?
I'll inform you of what you have.  You have **jack shit** except for one thing, which is your doom: **you have faith in thugs**.
[That is where you went **wrong**](  You correct that mistaken belief of yours, and then *maybe* you can have *some* influence.  **Not before**.


I don't grovel to pigs and thieves.  Dignity and all  that shit.

Ah.  I see what's going on here.
Your theory is that PayPal's behavior is *not* the consequence of them being afraid of government threats against a class of people that douches d.b.a. "government" ("government", hereafter) made up, which they termed "money service / transmitter businesses".
To cling to this theory, you deny the observable fact that PayPal uses government-invented terminology (like "money service / transmitter business") in their *stated reasons* to ban certain people.
You don't like this fact, because it directly refutes your theory, therefore you deny it, not by offering counterpoints or refutations or testable and incontrovertible theories, but by calling it "spin".
I see. I see what you did there.  Very clever.
Your behavior reminds me of the time when people believed that black men were naturally born to be slaves.  This belief was completely at odds with the fact that *they were not free because government had made it illegal for them to be free*.  It was a fascinating case of social schizophrenia, where the effects of a criminal gang were denied in favor of the most idiotic "explanations" for the misfortunes of mass kidnap victims.
I see that social schizophrenia still affects people to the day.  You're clearly not willing to integrate observable reality into your belief system, because your belief system is more important than truth to you.  You need to believe that government threats have nothing to do with PayPal's behavior, because accepting the reality that proves otherwise, means you have to abandon certain dogmas you're not prepared to abandon.
Well then, if you aren't persuaded by observable fact, ultimately nothing will persuade you (except perhaps violent threats, but I'm not in that business -- government is).
So, I think I'll just leave your denial to be judged by others on its merits.  You'll either die of old age worshipping the gangsters you tangentially defended here, or they'll kill you when their racket collapses.  I'm fine with either of those outcomes, because fundamentally they are *your choice* as an adult.  You're entitled to your slow march into the slaughterhouse, oblivious to the bullet that they've already put in your brain, which made you work half your life for their profit.  I won't deny you that odd pleasure -- live and let die.

Yes, there exist some magical papers that prohibit you and everyone else from peacefully using your money without some authority's permission / knowledge, or in ways this authority dislikes.
When people do that, the authority labels their actions with the scary-sounding name "money laundering".


They "make sense" *to you* because everything written in those papers "makes sense" *to you*.
If the papers say that your genitals must be fondled, well, that "makes sense" to you.  If the papers say that you must work six months each year for the authorities, or starve, then that "makes sense" to you.  If the papers say that you must be put in a cage because you refuse to go and murder people abroad, then that "makes sense" to you.
See a pattern here?  The pattern is that you have faith and unquestioning obedience for the papers and the priests that write them, and you believe whatever excuse you're given for the contents of the papers.  You've been told for many decades that you must do this, or else you're "bad".  Of course it "makes sense" to obey.
So, if you are told that you are not allowed to use your money, without the knowledge and consent of some strangers -- who have the power to murder you if you resist them -- and you are given some bullshit excuse such as "fighting pedorrism", that would "make sense" *to you*.

Bitcoin is a currency. Neutrality and agnosticism is for people.
Even if you were to stretch neutrality to cover currencies, Bitcoin still would **not** be neutral, because Bitcoin is a **stateless** currency **by design**, which **users use to support and enable statelessness**.

And then they announced that they would essentially eliminate the Sucre, taking Sucres at the now-devalued official price, and burning the old bills.
Of course, as it always is, key people with links to the government got advance notice of the "banking holiday" (in English: if you open your bank, we'll shoot you in the face, and if you tell anyone about our plans to steal from everyone, the same medicine for you).

 boner-inducing computer science follows this sentence.
Yes, he did, but the algorithm behind it was not his invention (*not linked lists*, as expressed by a co-conspirator here).
The blockchain itself is structured with an algorithm called "Merkle tree", which is a relatively new innovation in the field of computer science, and it's closely related to the family of algorithms powering WAFL checksumming filesystems like ZFS, in the sense that the checksum of a portion of the tree serves to cryptographically validate the rest of the tree.
ZFS, as explained, uses a similar algorithm to tell you if your data is corrupted, and to self-heal and recover without needing any filesystem check.  It's pretty rad, actually -- since I started using ZFS to store my data, I've lost many hard disks to catastrophic damage and I've had damaged sectors, but I haven't lost a single file, or even been blindsided by a corrupted file.
Apart from this very useful property, the tree used in the blockchain has the property of *ultrapruneability*: given a tree root, you can prune everything that "came before" without losing confidence that "you're in the right track" and no one is cheating you with newer, false blocks.   This means the 6 GB file on disk that "heavyweight" clients must build upon startup, is not really needed.   No client supports ultraprune just yet, but at some point all of them will. 
Satoshi's genius was to combine a solid P2P network with Merkle trees and proof of work.  As usual in the intellectual advancement field, he stood on the shoulders of giants, which shows because once you understand how the blockchain is built, you go "ah, that's obvious, I could have come up with that" (except I didn't).
Satoshi merely walked the less traveled algorithmic path, and that made all the difference.

Well, it varies from lender to lender, just as the mechanisms for identity assurance vary from lender to lender.  I suppose the more decent lenders will have you draft an official contract and perhaps even ask you to back your loan -- if it is significant -- by some asset.  I suppose you can go after someone's assets legally, but usually legal action is more costly than the property is worth.
Of course, bear in mind that when the various prices of Bitcoin fluctuate a lot, lending activity tends to slow down because, well, it's harder to predict how the settlement of the loan will go (whether the lender / the borrower will lose / make money through the agreement, at least on paper).

Some people don't understand that. Some people really do think that by murdering the Pope will end the Church.
These people have **not** understood that what empowers the Church is not the sack of organs in the elegant dress, but other people believing he has divine-like powers.
These people will fail and will, in fact, achieve the opposite of what they set out to do. Violence always achieves the opposite of the stated goals.
Also, anyone else suspicious about the timing? And the mentions of mixers? This can't be a coincidence.

Depending on what you mean by "bank", you might be talking about a building -- which can be objectively verified to exist -- or a group of people embarked in a common business venture.
This is in contrast to "State", which is the fictional concept of a superpower that endows certain people with the power to effectively transform organized evil into virtue ("by the power vested in my by the State", surely you've heard this phrase).  This group of people is often referred to as "government", which -- unlike a bank -- is a delusion because it is *defined* as an impossible concept: a group of people tied together by the notion that when they do certain evils, those evils magically become good.


Umm, this concept refers to a person in reality.  There is observable basis to confirm that the concept "individual" isn't imaginary.


I'd say that, no, "the banks" don't "like it", and I'm not blaming "States".  Though said shorthand is convenient, group concepts can't "like" stuff.  The accurate, observably verifiable notion is: *Some sociopaths who do business as banks* like it.  Big distinction, in line with the distinction between "God" and "pedophile priest".  Similarly, I'm blaming *the specific people* who operate under the delusion that "the State" has given them magical powers to ruin me and you, and to call that virtuous.

It is explicitly stated in the paper that Bitcoin will forever have a 21 million coin cap.  That is why Bitcoin was invented, deliberately so, and Satoshi himself intended that to be the case.
If anyone had the magical power to go into millions of computers against the owners' wills, and sabotage Bitcoin by removing the 21 million cap, Bitcoin will simply be no longer Bitcoin.  What's more, all those people will simply say "fuck that", stop running the sabotaged Bitcoin software, and run their own deflationary currency faithful to the original instead.

The answer is yes (implicitly), yes, yes.

Nono, you're right.  Decentralized actions are much, much harder to "regulate", simply because they are *more costly*.  They take more effort, these efforts multiply the cost, et cetera.  If the antisocials had to cage 20 million people, they probably could not do that.  Not enough prisons, and not enough money to build and man new ones on the spot.
(Then again, the DHS has enough hollowpoints to execute every man, woman and child in the U.S. several times over, and they are [already running training drills on shooting "zombies"]( -- unarmed and unthinking people, who could that be? -- to death.  All for "target practice", you know.  It'll still be costly, but they've tried their best to prepare for the next genocide by sinking those capital -- see what I did there? -- expenses in advance.)

You are all jumping joyously in front of your executors. You all don't even notice this is how Bitcoin dies as an anonymous currency free from control of governments
No one here truly understands the real message in this written threat: **"we are now aware of Bitcoin, we will start spying on you, and if you disobey any of our orders, we are going to put you in a cage"**. Both miners and exchanges have now been fully terrorized into being snitches for the criminal enterprise of enslaving everyone with 100% end-to-end efficiency.
Whereas before we were one community, with this act, these criminals you worship have successfully driven a wedge between bus -- now it's two group: those who obey and those of us who have been deemed "clandestine", who shall be hated and punished. From this point on, anyone who wishes to use Bitcoin to protect themselves effectively from these organized criminals, anyone who spends, sells, buys or exchanges bitcoins outside the "approved ways" (all of which allow the government to track you), *has now been designated an outlaw*, and caging / ruin / death awaits those who resist.
From this situation to total government tracking of money flows and zero possibility to escape their theft, it is but a small step. The tax farmers have co-opted all of you into even more total servitude. But you celebrate that. How servile.
Sigh. Slave-minded idiots, nearly all of you, naively happy because the eye of Sauron has finally locked its sight on you, celebrating defeat as if it was a victory, cheering like mad cows as your farmers line all of you up at the slaughterhouse. May you get the cages you foolishly cheered for.

What's brutal and barbaric is putting peaceful people in cages, and since that's what happens to millions of people today -- the vast majority of people in cages are "non-violent offenders" -- then it stands to reason that we are living in a pretty brutal place.  **Today**.
You just don't think the system we have today is brutal, because you're *used* to it, and you think "oh, that couldn't possibly happen to *me*".

I dunno what point you're trying to prove, Jonny, but you've missed the point.  We went from discussing whether "gold can fail as a currency" / "all currencies can fail", to you trying to prove to me that people prefer paper money to gold for some transactions.  I heard that podcast you quoted right now, way, way before you heard it first.
What are you trying to prove?  That gold has failed?  No, it hasn't, it was sabotaged last time in 1913 (and before that in the Roman Empire through physical debasing).  *If you had a case in support of the belief that all currencies fail, you would have made it many hours ago, in stead of the "in a millon years" sophistry you showed*.  You didn't.  You just showed some evidence that people chose to use different currencies in the face of aggression.  Great, you failed to prove your point, that's not "currency failure", you know very well what we're discussing, shame on you  for trying to pass cats as rabbits.
This point has *nothing* to do with free banking, and it has everything to do with your inability to classify events properly.  You cannot quote me a single instance of gold failing as a currency without redefining failure to mean not failure, or currency to mean not currency.  Your belief is shit out of luck.  Where the fuck is the proof for your statements?  Ahem, you have presented no proof whatsoever that all currencies have failed.  **None**.

But why must you equate groveling to / bribing the sociopaths -- which, in my view, is counterproductive because it empowers and legitimizes these terrorists -- with the *only possible course of action*?
I do many things to protect myself from the sociopaths. Some of them I can't tell you about, and others I do daily, like raising awareness of the gun in the room, and ensuring that people get to hear the voluntaryist message.

No, seriously, good advice, but... The problem you have described applies only to trades where a fiat currency is the endgame.
Cashing out in cash... Quarter million dollars... doesn't work. Keep it there in the market, re-buy cheap coins and then cash out in actual coins (where the chance that you will get 20c on the $ is infinitesimally small even if the place goes bust). Transfer happens. This won't take hours but minutes. You get your coins... Endgame.
When you cash out, your options are not limited. You're not getting stock. You're getting stuff you can spend or sell for cash at many places on the street.
No one controls monetary policy in the Bitcoin end game.

Agreed.  Lots of people don't really know how to think.
For example: if something seems "truish" to them because of repetition of a lie, then they assume it's true.  Another example: if something shares a characteristic with another thing, then they tend to confuse the two things.  Yet another example: they don't know how to deduce whether a thing belongs to a category.
That's what's going on here.
Feller above knows that Bitcoin has made large price gains, he also knows that the price has gone up because people are buying lots of bitcoins, and knows those two things are usually things that happen with Ponzi schemes too.  Those are all true statements (validated by reality).
Ergo, he "reasons", "Bitcoin must be a Ponzi scheme".  BZZT, *wroooong*.
That conclusion is in error, of course, because "large price moves and lots of people buying" does NOT define what a Ponzi scheme is, so Bitcoin does NOT belong in that category.  Proof that he's not really thinking logically -- he's just performing a shoddy heuristic pattern match, latching on to whatever "conclusions" sound truthy to him.
Which is sad, if you think about it.  How many people out there walk around with brains so hobbled that they can't execute most elementary thinking procedures correctly?  I'd wager it's a lot of people, because it's profitable and advantageous to stupidify them and nullify their reasoning skills in school.  Makes for very obedient people who can be fooled into believing pretty much anything "WMDs"?  Yeah, most people swallowed that and cheered for mass murder.  "If you don't like the system, vote to change it"?  Seems like the perfect illusion to keep people obedient and passive while they are being fleeced.

All of the above aren't "failure" of gold as a currency.   They are the direct and deliberate result of organized coercion.  Gold is not used today as it was used in the past, not because gold has "failed" somehow, but because it has been deliberately *sabotaged* by organized gangsters.
Imagine you and I, standing next to each other.  I tell you "I have no problem walking here".  You tell me "bah, eventually you will have a problem", and, as "proof", you swipe my legs as I take a few steps.  Now I'm on the ground, hurt, and you stand next to me, telling me "told you so, told you that you wouldn't be able to walk".
Is that a "failure to walk" of mine?  Or is that just the product of your criminal action causing me to fall?

I don't dispute the fact that imposing an interest rate on people by force, or destroying the value of people,'s money alters their behavior. I just prefer none of that be forced on me. Thus my choice in Bitcoin.
I *like* the fact that interest rates cannot be imposed on me by anyone in Bitcoin. That allows for the *true* price of money (interest) -- and by extension, salaries -- to be revealed organically, rather than be distorted by a bunch of strangers I could not care less about.
So what if the interest rate in a free market is "too damn high" according to you? It's just your opinion rather than fact, no more a fact than you saying "the price of milk *ought* to be cheaper" is not a fact, and setting milk prices is out of your control.

The authorities' behavior responds to the unstated belief that regular people are "cattle" to be milked, whose autonomy, control, and wealth, must be controlled at all times, to prevent them from "escaping" with what is perceived to belong to the authorities, rather than to the "cattle".
That belief is, obviously, evil.  I don't say that lightly.  If one subscribes to the belief that punishing people to get them to work and keep the product of that work (a.k.a. "chattel slavery") is evil, then one must necessarily conclude that punishing people to obtain the products of their work *after* they have worked is evil as well.

People who speak of intrinsic value need to learn economics. NOTHING has intrinsic value. Value is NOT a characteristic of an object.
Value is a **relation** between a person, an object of putative value, and the circumstances in which the person finds himself w.r.t. the object. It varies from person to person, from object to object, from moment to moment.
This is established, trivially proven fact.
It is no crime to be ignorant, but it is highly toxic to vehemently speak of matters one ignores.

Oh, no. nononono.    You're very confused here.  You've confused two different things:
Concept (1).  The car I sold a few months ago, I acquired it peacefully and consensually from the previous owner, so it was mine until I sold it.   Ergo, I *did* own that car.  
Concept (2).  Armed gunmen in costumes and the cultists in robes -- and idiots who drank their Kool-Aid, like you -- *don't think I owned* that car (except in name).  Their excuse is that they can just take it, as if it was theirs, and demand ransom, unless I obey some magical piece of paper that says "if you don't follow these rituals, we now own your shit".   They *believe* that *unless* I do as they tell me to, I *don't own* anything they can just take away by force.
When I tell you that the cultists wouldn't *allow* me to sell it until I performed the ritual of "registration", that's concept (2).  Concept (2) is **legal opinions**.
When I say I sold a car, I'm speaking of (1).  Concept (1) is **ownership**.
What we've been speaking of all along, *and what OP is saying* is that **legal opinions** are beliefs that **addle** and **destroy** the concept of **ownership**.
But you haven't even been able to understand this simple idea that OP put forth.
See?  Your addled brain can't even disentangle the **opinions** of the cultists about ownership, from *actual ownership*.  I feel sorry for you, mate.  No wonder you can't follow the "conversation" (I put that in scarequotes because you're half of it, and you ain't holding your end of the convo).

That is all I can give you, and you are not interested in it, so I'll stop.
In the grand scheme of things, it really does not matter that you're wrong; the important thing is that the price of Bitcoin goes up when some of them go missing. That is where I wanted to go to with this conversation, and someone else has already given you a solid explanation. Since it appears that you don't understand explanations of ideas, I won't continue trying, but it's okay for you to be wrong -- nothing bad is going to happen to anyone else because of your wrongness.

Ah, awesome... if we are going to do maths like *that*, then governments are clearly the worldwide champions of evil.
First, on the slavery matter. Not only did governments catch fleeing slaves *for free* -- without which slavery would not have been possible to begin with -- slavery was actually legalized, not by corporations, but by *governments*.
That's right, without governments punishing people who refused to obey slavery laws, there would have been no slavery. So who actually caused slavery? Obviously governments.
Second, given your penchant for misleadingly comparing only *one* government to the consequences of *all slave trade*, I will now make the comparison fair again, by speaking for *all government activity*; I will do it in God mode, by referring only to the 20th century data, just to spite your pro-democidal ass.
So what are the numbers? Just in those 100 years, governments murdered **270 million** of their **own people**, excluding all wars. That's right. Government murders dwarf all other types of murders *including* your "beloved" slavery.

Very well said.
The natural scarcity of objects causes humans to enter into violent conflicts. It is precisely that which the concept of property (and its rules) was invented for -- to prevent violent conflict over scarce resources.
Intangibles are not scarce. To use a chair, two people need to fight over it or agree on some rules beforehand ("property"), because the chair can only have one simultaneous occupant (basic physics). But the same two men can use different copies of the same idea without having to fight over it to see who gets to use it. Intangibles don't "wear out", can be shared infinitely, and the marginal cost of making more of the same intangible is ~zero. Nonscarcity defined, prima facie. Hence, applying the rules of property to them is absurd.
Since I'm tired, I won't get into how applying the rules of property to intangibles *also* has toxic and harmful consequences for every man, woman and child.

@_date: 2013-04-11 16:24:03
Sorry, but it's been about 10 years since I ceased believing all of those popular myths ("rule of law", "we can't build complex things without Godvernment"), and 15 since I shed the religious variants of them ("piety", "we can't have a Universe without God").   I somehow don't think I'm coming *back* to them, if you catch my drift.
Now, we may have been off to a bad start here.  Though I already explained exactly how "rule of law" is a mythological concept, that might have been a tactical mistake on my part.  I don't want this conversation to be about me explaining to you why I don't believe them, including your latest political creationism myth.  Apologies on my part if I gave you the wrong impression that I'm here to tell you how "you're wrong" or how what I have concluded is "right".
The reality is that I don't *have* to do any of that.  I don't really owe you (or anyone else) any explanation for why I reject the myths you believe in.  It's also unproductive to me to explain why -- I'm not getting paid to educate other people out of their myths.  So it's like I have zero incentive to deal in myths; *negative*, in fact, since people usually get angry when I poke at their myths.  Violent, even.
Bottom line: my life has no myths, including the myth that I have a made-up obligation to justify my conclusions to anyone else.  I am at peace with what I've observed in reality.   We can talk, and I can answer your questions, and I enjoy doing that under certain circumstances, but I really don't have to.  You have to make it worth my while, I suppose.
So, if you want to make this an *interesting* conversation for me, how about you answer these questions for me:
- *What is it that you're trying to accomplish in this conversation?*  Like, what's your goal?  Is it to persuade me?  For example, I know what *I* am trying to accomplish -- I want to revise my observations of how the world works, understand more details of how these myths infect people's brains (usually it's fear), and just shoot the breeze.
- If I walked away from this conversation right now, *what would be your ideal outcome*?  Me having learnt something new and agreed that what you showed me is correct, or me having been shamed and insulted by you just for not sharing your beliefs?  I need to know this so I can gauge your intentions and ethics in your relationship with me.  Like, if you wanna damage me, why should I give you the time of day?

Nono, to make up for the **retarded** "adding decimals begets inflation" claim you made.  This isn't a "knowledge gap in others" -- this is *hilarious ignorance* in *you*.

@_date: 2013-02-24 17:44:51
Again, from the first statement you gave me just now (which I mostly agree with) your conclusion does not follow either.
First, there is no evidence and I have no reason to believe that Bitcoin will lead to lower employment. Other than perhaps fewer bureaucrats and banksters, but progress does that for many professions, and those affected have to find new jobs, so this is not exclusive to Bitcoin.
Second, even if widespread adoption of Bitcoin did lead to lower employment, whatever little employment remains might very well be so much more productive in nature, that more wealth is produced than before (cf. computers, robots). Remember that a change to Bitcoin doesn't just change only employment rate. Also remember that you can get full employment by hiring people to dig and then fill ditches... But you wouldn't claim that full employment of ditch diggers and ditch fillers leads to wealth, right?
All in all, while I agree that, ceteris paribus, more people producing something *that others demand*, leads to more wealth, I do not agree with the belief that only employment is what produces wealth, or that all employment produces wealth, or that Bitcoin will produce a ceteris paribus decrease in employment or wealth. I see no reason to jump to these conclusions.
To summarize: in my experience, there will always be things that people need more than they need Bitcoin in their wallets, and those needs will generate a demand for employees making them, even if luxuries suddenly become less attractive than keeping coins (which I doubt). Will this mean that employment goes down a notch? Perhaps. Will that in turn *necessarily* mean less wealth? I don't see that.
So I am unpersuaded by your argument. You can believe whatever you want, but it appears that your belief has no basis.
Have anything else?

You're suggesting a "boil the ocean" solution.  I will tell you why.  You didn't consider that there would be an anti-Bitcoin lobby.  There already is, they already bribe the people you want us to bribe, it's called "the banking industry".
Here's what will happen if people listen to you: these corrupt people you suggested we ought to bribe, will take your hundreds of millions' worth of bribes, pocket them, and then take the *billions*' worth of bribes from people who see Bitcoin as a menace (*bankers et al*), then tell you "fuck you, you probably want Bitcoins because you are a pederast".
*That's what they do.  As a career.*
In other words, there is *no way* that Bitcoin users will ever *out-bribe* those people who are *already bribing* the corrupt ones, and whose fortunes would vanish if Bitcoin became successful.
There.  Rather than daydreaming that somehow, corrupt people will some day, given enough money to them, somehow embrace Bitcoin, look at reality and realize that your plan is just a colossal waste of Bitcoins that will only leave Bitcoiners poorer than they were.
If you disagree, you're welcome to answer this question, see if you can persuade me: 
*What evidence do you have that any group of Bitcoiners willing to give money to these corrupt cocksuckers, won't be out-spent with the pocket change of people already bribing the corrupt cocksuckers?*

There is no computational way to distinguish lost coins from coins saved in long term storage. In Bitcoin. Other alt coins support this -- you may want to look into them and not use Bitcoin.
However, if you find a way to recirculate lost coins that *does not steal* from long term storage coins, let us know. Expect to need at least a PhD in computer science, and major experience hacking. And enough clout to convince the guardians of the code to merge your patch in.

Because non-business Bitcoin end users won't likely be targeted, at least at first.  That only happens later, when all legal Bitcoin businesses have been terrorized into folding, and then the only remaining users of Bitcoin are people who want to do illegal stuff with it.  At that stage, it's much easier to automatically guilt anyone who uses Bitcoin with the magical word "criminal", regardless of whether what he's doing is peaceful and decent or not.  Worked for drugs, worked for alcohol, worked for guns, you can imagine the strategy might work for Bitcoin.

I resent your implicit characterization of me having my own ideas and speaking truth as "why Bitcoin isn't taken seriously". I am not going do change my mind just because some people find it unpopular.
Here is a tip: A community of special interest has all kinds of members, who usually fall out of the "ordinary spectrum of thought", and you should expect people (like me) who think very much outside the norm. *That isn't bad*. That is how change happens. Meaningful change. Not "Obama change". Not "loose change". Actual change.
The world is NOT, contrary to common belief, a popularity contest. We are all here navigating the world with our interests, our ideas, our actions. So what if *today* people don't take Bitcoin seriously? Good ideas may take centuries to win, but they *do* win.

to transfer funds to the account of another Citibank customer in the U.S. **or in select markets
outside the U.S.** or receive funds into your account from another Citibank customer in the U.S. The
minimum transaction amount is $1, exclusive of the transaction fee. There is no fee for receiving
a Citibank® Global Transfer into your account. When you send a Citibank® Global Transfer to the
account of another Citibank customer in the U.S., the funds will be debited from your designated
eligible account and immediately credited to the recipient’s account. Transfers to U.S. accounts will
be made in U.S. dollars. When you send a Citibank® Global Transfer to another Citibank account
held by you or anyone else outside of the U.S., the funds will be debited from your designated
eligible account and credited to the recipient’s account. Generally, the transfer will be made in the
currency of the foreign recipient’s account. Citibank’s exchange rate includes a commission for the
conversion service. For general terms and conditions regarding funds transfers, please refer to the
“Funds Transfer” Section of your Client Manual.


September 28, 2013, this service will be **discontinued**. However, the Account to Account service to Mexico will continue to be available.

Now, maybe you consider that living in a particular geographical area proves that you have authorized some *special group of strangers*, who *do not own* the geographical area where you are, to *give you orders*, *take money* from you, and *put you in a cage* if you resist these actions.
I respect that belief.  And I respect you.  Thus, I respect your decision to act consistent to said belief.  When you obey everything they tell you to do, and give them all the money they demand from you, I have no problem with that -- provided that you respect me too.  I am not being facetious or sarcastic in the slightest when I say that I respect you acting consistent with this belief of yours.  I'm not even gonna try to convince you otherwise.
However, I find that belief insufficient as proof *for me*.  Thus, I don't *share* your belief.
Because I've concluded the belief is circular.  In my view, your "proof that I've consented" is similar to the "proof of God" that states your existence is proof that "God exists, and God can kill you, because God made you". The proof assumes that which it attempts to prove.  It's either incomplete or circular, and adding more justificatory premises to it won't fix that.
After years of pondering your belief and believing it too, I've come to this view: I don't consider "you're in this huge pen, so you must somehow have authorized this special group of strangers to punish you if you don't obey them" is true.  They don't own me, or my work, or my obedience, or my body, or my life.  This "you're in my territory" excuse is something that rapists, pederasts, murderers and kidnappers don't get away with, so why would these strangers get away with *that* as an excuse?  *Magic?*  *Divine Providence?*  *Because I say so?*  *Threats?*
In fact, I consider that anyone making this *claim of property* over me, is a *dangerous and delusional criminal*, wrongly passing himself off as an "authority", whom I must watch out for and protect myself from.  In fact, this type of criminal would be *more dangerous* than independent criminals, because indies at least *know* that what they're doing is wrong, so they don't act *zealously, brazenly and righteously* to harm me, in the way that the delusional criminal -- believing himself to be *more righteous* than his victim -- most definitely would.
Now that you know why I don't share your belief, will you respect me like I respect you?  Or will you happily anticipate these dangerous criminals harming me, a "heathen unbeliever"?

Bitcoin wallets are considered financial accounts by FinCEN.  You are abroad, and presumably the coins are with you / accessible by you, and they are not in the U.S., so that makes them foreign.

I **am not forcing** anyone to pay / not pay your blood money, or to engage / not engage in snitching on your customers.  But **you are in favor of forcing me** to do these things, or **quite literally ruining my life** if I disobey.
*You* may not wield the weapon yourself -- probably because *you're too cowardly* to actually shoot me in the face, rob me, kidnap me, or break my bones yourself -- but you clearly want me ruined / caged / impoverished / exiled / dead for not believing the same things you do, and acting consistent with my conscience.

Two or more people agree on exchanging their coins (same amount?).  They each use a computer program that will start a transfer but not sign it until everyone has pledged their coins in a rendezvous "coinjoin server".  When everyone is ready, the transaction is signed by everyone, and the coins at play are instantly exchanged from person to person in a way that makes it impossible to trace back to the original owner.
Your balance remains the same, and so does the balance of every other participant.  Everyone now has "new coins" but no one snitched on each other during the process.

Um, no.  A unit of measurement is "a definite magnitude of a physical quantity,"  Value is most definitely not a physical quantity and certainly cannot be said to have a "definite magnitude".
Currency is "money in any form when in actual use or circulation, as a medium of exchange,".

Well, now you know this isn't what a currency is, so there isn't any big problem that needs to be addressed.

In case you were wondering what made these entrepreneurs all suddenly into "regulation is the future, k-k-choo" parrots, here is why:
What you all are witnessing here is not "people suddenly seeing how regulation is beneficial". It's rather a terror-induced shakedown by asshats doing business as "government", intended to identify, sideline and ruin businessmen unwilling to obey. They are threats to the asshats' control of the world.
The future of Bitcoin isn't "regulation". It is private businessmen making Faustian bargains with organized extortionists.
The extortionists get to use these people as mouthpieces ("regulation good, free market baaa-aa-a-d") and use of their businesses as snitches, having them spy on everyone to, of course, ultimately punish disobedient people.
The businessmen get temporary favorable treatment from the extortionists. They get not to have their businesses robbed or sabotaged by the extortionists. That is, until the next shakedown -- where the extortion victims will be more likely to obey unflinchingly, since they already capitulated before.
What a deal, huh? Of course, those who don't toe the line -- they who get the racketeers' little written threat ("subpoena") and decide to ignore it -- simply lose everything in the process. If you disobey, the extortionists do you a von NotHaus or a Liberty Reserve. They violently pluck you out of whatever hole you're living in -- with zero consideration to whatever "laws" might prohibit them from kidnapping you. Then then throw you in a cage with the pretext of made-up sins. You will remain there until the cultists in black mumus declare that it is "justice" to steal everything you own and keep you in the cage for good.
TLDR: They have been commandeered. Now you understand why suddenly the Bitcoin businessmen are all suddenly waddling in line, parroting the same tired old line of "obedience good, four legs bad".
The world is mad -- and you're catching a rare glimpse of the method to the madness.

As I suspected and stated earlier, it appears that you and I mean different things when we use the same symbols.
I'll take some time to explain what's going on here, taking the word "force" as an example.
* When I say "force" ("briangle" henceforth), I mean *literal threats or actual violence* inficted by one human being onto another.  To me, "I'm briangling you to do X" means that I am inflicting physical pain or threatening to do so, to get you to do X.  A rapist or a cop briangle people.  A breadmaker or a Bitcoin node do not.
* When you say "force" ("trircle" henceforth), it's not exactly clear what you mean -- you don't define your terms -- but it's perfectly clear to me that you are not talking at all about "briangle", as observable reality shows that no "literal threat or actual violence" is ever inflicted by the Bitcoin network or any of its participants onto *any* person.
"Trircle" and "briangle", thus, obviously mean different things, even as we both use the word "force" to refer to either of them.
Now, I'll be frank.  I'm not in the business of telling you *how* you are supposed to use this or that word.  However, I *can* see this:
1. From my perspective, you're in an entirely different dimension, where my  "up" is your "down", my "consensual payment" is your "force", et cetera.  How do you expect me to understand anything you say?
2. Your -- to me, weird -- use of words definitely feels like you're trying to confuse me and play word games, regardless of your actual intentions.  Instead of being clear, you come across as very confused.
3. Many more people use the word "force" to mean "briangle" as opposed to "trircle".   *This affects you*.  It puts you at a disadvantage when talking to other people, because people read what you say and (understandably) go "Whaaa?  What's this guy even mean?  Where's the force he's talking about here?".
Unfortunately, so long as you persist in not defining your terms, respecting shared meanings, your attempts to communicate your ideas will not work.  Try typing BASIC into a COBOL interpreter, and you'll get an idea of why your attempts to communicate aren't working.
Sorry if this disappoints you.

And then they *celebrated* when the authorities started threatening peaceful businesspeople, forcing them to ask permission and pay millions! They celebrated because, in their limited minds, this terrorism marked the beginning of "legitimacy". How fucked up slave-mentality is that?

Mmmno. "Intrinsic" is a very concrete and objectively ascertainable quality of a property. It is not vague at all.


Now **this** is a vague definition (the scarequotes are the tipoff).
Again, no, wrong. "True" != "essential".  They are different concepts, which is why we have different words for them.


Nothing has "intrinsic value", that is correct.  See my other comment on the topic in this post.
By the way, you're doing the "well, I don't wanna be wrong, so I'm just gonna double down and reject established definitions for words".
I really don't like that. It makes me way less likely to take anything you say seriously, because it indicates to me that you seem to care more about feeling "right" than about the truth and learning new things.

Competitors are always going to be there, whether I give or not.
The benefits I (and everyone else) gets from my contributions, won't be there if I don't give.  I've learned the hard way that I have to give value to others, if I expect value to be given to me in return, whether the return is direct or not.  In no small part, I can compete, and I can give, because others gave to me *voluntarily* -- without any strings attached, or threats forcing them to give.
I've given hundreds of hours of labor to the podcast, thousands of dollars to Freedomain Radio, likewise for the School Sucks project, and hundreds of dollars to Wikipedia.  They have given me incalculable value in terms of making my life better, more enjoyable, peaceful and edifying relationships.  They gave this value to me *unprompted*, for *free*, no strings attached.  Why on Earth would I not give back?
I give because I know that, when I give, I get in return.  Just as they gave, and, hell yeah, imagine that, they got in return.  This is only a personal example, I acknowledge... but from what I've seen in my life, it absolutely pays off.

Correct. I mean, *technically*, as far as we know from past experience, PayPal "isn't liable" for processing a payment for equipment to any business. But there is no telling what the cultists in black robes and wigs may say about that. Corrupt fucks that they are, they just may try to sabotage PayPal because authoritay power trip. Again, if they have to lie and say that a pear is an apple, well that just comes naturally to sociopaths.


Of course. Not to say that PayPal isn't venal (it is, their actions don't lie) or to justify them (understanding isn't justification), but if you were running a multi billion dollar business and there existed these gangs who can fuck you up, get you caged, ruined, killed, if you enable competing interests... What would you do?
I would fold. I know my life isn't worth going against gangsters with machine guns, bombs and rape cages.


Terrorism is alive and well, it just calls itself a different name.

The condescension in the way you treat me (technically, anyone who doesn't believe the same doctrine as you) shows me that you suffer from the same problem Richard does.
I understand, and I don't intend to change your mind. In response, I expect you not to insist with advice that I followed ten years ago when I asked myself the question you still haven't asked yourself (to wit: what if politics, taxes, laws, are simply scams?). The reason I stopped believing the insane state slavery cult dogma I reject now, is precisely because I followed that advice.

Hoppe once said that in any conflict with any *ultimate* arbiter of all conflicts, the arbiter would obviously rule in his own favor.  He also noted as a corollary, that the arbiter would obviously *start* conflicts for his own profit, and rule himself to be the "victim" and the victim to be the aggressor.
You are seeing with your own eyes exactly what Hoppe said would happen.  They robbed him.  They told him "you want your money?  jump thru these hoops to come and get it!".  When he did, they then proceeded to tell him "fuck you, we ain't giving it back".
Predictable.  To claim otherwise, to deny observable reality, is to be insane.

This is the kind of truth-bearing (claims to be true) objective (pertaining to observable reality) statement that is trivially proven false (not corresponding to observable reality)... *by pointing to a fact of observable reality* like, um, [BTCJam](
I would even argue this statement is not just false, but **abusive** -- it is a form of **gaslighting**: blatant, epistemic deceit, told with the primary intention of confusing and attacking the target's perception of reality.

I understand that my stance irritates you, because you *do* recognize that buying out corrupt people for protection is ethically gray at best... which is why you just tried to make this personal by belittling me.

Just learn not to make disagreements personal.
People willing to taint themselves by participating in corrupt acts, always reserve a tinge of condescension and belittlement towards decent people.  "Oh, you wanna live a 'pure' life?  Look at you, poor square, how naive, you don't know how the world works."

They are. Idiots crave approval and the illusion of safety more than actual safety. I will now echo what I said earlier in another post.
You are all jumping joyously in front of your executors. You all don't even notice this is how Bitcoin dies as an anonymous currency free from control of governments
No one here truly understands the real message in this written threat: **"we are now aware of Bitcoin, we will start spying on you, and if you disobey any of our orders, we are going to put you in a cage"**. Both miners and exchanges have now been fully terrorized into being snitches for the criminal enterprise of enslaving everyone with 100% end-to-end efficiency.
Whereas before we were one community, with this act, these criminals you worship have successfully driven a wedge between bus -- now it's two group: those who obey and those of us who have been deemed "clandestine", who shall be hated and punished. From this point on, anyone who wishes to use Bitcoin to protect themselves effectively from these organized criminals, anyone who spends, sells, buys or exchanges bitcoins outside the "approved ways" (all of which allow the government to track you), *has now been designated an outlaw*, and caging / ruin / death awaits those who resist.
From this situation to total government tracking of money flows and zero possibility to escape their theft, it is but a small step. The tax farmers have co-opted all of you into even more total servitude. But you celebrate that. How servile.
Sigh. Slave-minded idiots, nearly all of you, naively happy because the eye of Sauron has finally locked its sight on you, celebrating defeat as if it was a victory, cheering like mad cows as your farmers line all of you up at the slaughterhouse. May you get the cages you foolishly cheered for.

I'd ask you to explain, give details and substantiate, but I don't think that's your thing. Your thing is more scaremongering so I see no reason whatsoever to take you thru the process.
Here is what I do know: you didn't "look into it". **That is a lie**. It's bullshit. You looked not an inch past your preconceptions. That's what you did, because you could not have possibly looked into thousands upon thousands of pages of examples, theories, observations, and common sense.
That, your mental myopia, is why you don't see how competing public defenders can work together. Which is supremely irrational because today we have many examples of **that very thing which you say is impossible**.

* Raise your children peacefully and teach them how to think
* Fuck your wife whenever she wants sex
* Cook a steak every once in a while, and if you're vegan, cook vegetables
* Drive a stick, or buy a car with a decent automatic transmission, or walk 20 miles to work
* Help other human beings when they are in need and it won't ruin your life to help them
* Be decent
***That is what you need to do, before you call yourself a man***.  
Things that won't make you a man:
* Call "your" congresspig (to be put on an answering machine and forever ignored, or talk to one of the clowns instead of the circus  owner)

Of course not.
Inb4 "but you use so many government services", I only use certain things they provide with stolen money, because they leave me no meaningful and self-destructive choice.
Kinda like you *have* to eat the food that your kidnapper gives you, because you'll starve otherwise, but others don't get to point at you and say "see! you ate!  that means you accepted being kidnapped".
In any case, while I refrain from consuming as much as possible from the stolen goods, it doesn't really matter what happens to the loot after it has been robbed.  The time to worry whether any wrong is being committed is when the robbery happens, not when the loot is distributed.  And  I don't see it as an obligation to starve or live like a miser to "prove a point", in any case, because martyrdom very rarely changes anything.

Yes, a criminal gang of people doing business as "government" stole a bunch of land and a bunch of cash from their victims, then they built long and flat structures that car owners have no choice but to use, then they made sure no one else built the very same structure without their permission.  Result: their shitty roads that kill half a million people a year in accidents.

What follows are the opinions of the criminal gang called IRS, to the best of my understanding.
If you receive *income* of any kind, they will say you "owe them" the equivalent of that which you received in U.S. dollars. Cars, houses, rings, land, doesn't matter.
If you buy anything, they will say you don't "owe them" anything (the state might want a portion of that action from the seller though, and they call this pretense "sales tax", but that's a different crook).
If you sell that which you bought for a profit, they will say you "owe them" a percentage of the profit (pretense called by them "capital gains"). Doesn't matter what the thing is that you sold.
Of course, this only applies if they can prove that you own the stuff you want to protect from them.

The guidance tells you in no uncertain terms what the prosecution is going to be arguing when you're called "defendant" by the fat man in a black dress.
In other words: When they say "we believe that so-and-so who transmits more than $1000 worth of BTC from location to location must register as a MSB", what they are saying LOUD and CLEAR to their prospective victims is "your honor, defendant operates a so-called mixer service, which was used to transmitt 20 BTC from wallet A to wallet B, yet defendant failed to register as an MSB, in violation of yadda yadda, he is a felon, throw the book at him."
Since they convict like 95% of the people they seat down on their kangaroo rooms, you can be sure that whatever those words deem "illegal" (explicitly or otherwise) are the inexorable and certain equivalent of "illegal" coming out of the 12 patsies in the jury box, and in the fat man's precedent-setting decision.
Poof, you are now a criminal. Even the arrest is good to fuck your job prospects. Imagine those 5 years in the cage. There will be one, perhaps two "public examples" who didn't understand they were going to be victimized and will walk into that legal beartrap blindly. Then they'll be convicted. Then everyone will say "well in hindsight it was obvious that they were running an illegal service, it was their fault". Then the rest of the mixers will close shop. That's all folks. Now the government has total awareness of every expenditure and income you have ever had.

 why did you dodge my question?


And "illicit" is anything that is prohibited by the pieces of paper, contrary to the nefarious connotation you attempt to impress on your readers.
Papers which include many prohibitions against using money -- regardless of how peacefully and consensually it was obtained -- without asking for permission or snitching on yourself first.
For example, right now, the magic papers say it is a "felony" to pass 100BTC or more thru a coin mixing service that does not snitch on you, just as they declare it a "felony" to sell your mined coins without registering both as an MSB and as an MTB. None of these acts "are illegal" because the money actually came from fraud, theft or other malevolent activities -- they are illegal *simply because* the victim didn't ask for permission or snitched on himself to the ~~authorities~~rulers. None of this is debatable -- you can go and read the magic papers yourself. So you know these commandments have nothing to do with justice, and everything to do with obedience. 
So "money laundering" is exactly about using your money without the permission or knowledge of the rulers, regardless of whether you did anything wrong or without consideration to whether you caused any observable harm. **The "illicit" qualifier is empty in meaning because it means in observable practice nothing else other than "disobeying orders". That word is merely propaganda for scaremongering and intellectual terror.**
Your objection is vacuous.
By the way, I am not really replying to convince you. I don't think contrasting what you say with reality will change your mind, seeing as you have already chosen dogma over reality. I am merely replying because your framing of the issue of "money laundering" is entirely disinformation, and it needs to be slapped like the bitch it is.

It's really hilarious because every money that was government-created (fiat) has failed so far (save for the few ones who have yet to fail), with the average lifespan being like 30 years or so.
In contrast, moneys not created by government are the only ones which have lasted for thousands of years. Gold, silver and copper? All still exactly as usable as currencies as they always were, and gold is still used as currency between sovereign entities to date.

Nothing has "intrinsic value". "Intrinsic value" is a Platonic myth, a kind of belief in the "soul" of an object, an "aether" theory, often used to incorrectly explain away why things have certain prices.  In this sense, this belief very similar to the childish "oomph" theory of momentum, which is used to explain why objects continue to move until they stop, when in ignorance of the actual physics behind it (momentum, friction, et cetera).
In reality, value is not an attribute intrinsic in (belonging naturally, essential, inseparable from) any object.  It is an *extrinsic relationship* between the subject (you) and the object (gold), influenced by circumstances, actual, unforeseen or expected.
That is why it is a *verb*. You *value* certain things, some of them more, some of them less. Often you value things for their practical utility, and often you just value them for sentimental reasons.
What is more, your valuations are not static, but vary from circumstance to circumstance, generally related to your perceived utility of the object. That's right, depending on the circumstances, you can value the exact same thing way more, or not at all.
E.g. what would you value more while in the desert and at risk of death by dehydration, a gold ounce or a bottle of water?  Another example: would you pay ten cents more for a cold soda vs. a warm one? Yet another one: what would you give up not to lose the family heirlooms, and is that more or less than what a stranger would give you to get them?
The sooner humanity abandons this superstition of "objects have a soul, ant that is value", the faster we will become prosperous and happy.

Your argument was rightfully downvoted because it is entirely unfalsifiable and unapproachable.
There is zero rigour in your claim, and zero proof as well; even the terms you used, you failed to define.  You don't define what "optimal" means. You don't explain how exactly Bitcoin doesn't allow to cater for the low real interest rate loans market, either when the price has stabilized or right now. You don't explain to us why is it important or preferable that said market needs to be catered to. You don't even explain who is "society", and your claim that "xxxxx" is "optimal" for *all society* it exceptionally strong. Even the terminology you use is entirely arbitrary -- "cater to", "optimal", "society"? That's as vague as you can get.
As such, it isn't any different from any other uninformed layman's opinion. You begin by saying "so-and-so is a problem", but you don't tell us why? Excuse me, that is an abuse of our attention and time.

Okay, basics.
Regulation is an euphemism that describes an ongoing process:
1. Some "important" people, who enjoy the perception of what's called "political authority", get together and write some orders on a paper, along with instructions on how to punish those who disobey these orders.
2. They get together and perform a popularity ritual.
3. After the ritual has been performed, those orders get transcribed to this big fat "book" containing previous orders.  This figurative book is known as "the law of the land".
4. Other groups of people -- some wearing blue costumes, some wearing black mumus, some wearing suits, you name it -- pick the process up from here and conspire to punish people who disobey the orders, according to the prescriptions written along the orders.  Most of these punishments are life-ruining, of course.  I'll explain as we go along.
5. The punishment process always begins with one of these people either sending you a letter with a threat, or presenting themselves to threaten you to your face.
6. If you resist this, armed costumed men will come to your home and drag you to a cage.
7. If you resist that, they will use brutal violence to break your body down until you do everything they say or they can drag you to that cage.
8. If you resist that through more effective means, they will execute you, and possibly members of your family.
9. Long after you've been thrown in this cage and deprived of human contact, they will start yet another ritual where they accuse you of horrible-sounding things that, generally, are not at all wrong to do.
10. Once you are there, they will attempt to extort you in the following way: they will threaten you with many, many years kidnapped in the cage, away from your loved ones, living like an animal... and then they will offer to take a few years off from their kidnapping, if you would concede to accuse yourself of a bunch of things you did not do.  That part of the process is called "plea bargain", as if you're getting a bargain because they won't kidnap you for too long if only you blame yourself for things you didn't do, that often aren't even wrong to begin with.
10. If you do not agree to this extortive "bargain", 99 times out of 100, the antisocials calling you names and ruining your public image will deceive twelve people in numerous ways, to get them to find you "guilty" of the names they called you; the antisocials will use that as an excuse to keep you many more years in a cage, often full of rapists.
8. No matter what the outcome of this process is, these antisocial individuals will very likely take everything you have and spend it on themselves on others, leaving you broke and ruined.  They will not be blamed for whatever brutal acts they perpetrated on you, or whatever they stole in this manner.
9. Inexplicably, most people who learn about anyone whose life was ruined by these antisocial and violent individuals, will automatically assume that the victim of such terror-inducing ordeal is to blame, is at fault, is evil, and their victimization is just and deserved.
10. If you are still alive at this point, *and* they decide to let you go.
Oh, I forgot to mention: this is what the antisocials call "justice".
So, applied theory time.  Let's assume the papers written in step 1 say that you are to be punished with 5 years in a cage if you own more than 100 BTC without first snitching on yourself to these people.  Now let's assume that one of these antisocial individuals somehow finds out.  Run yourself from step 1 to step N above, see the outcome for you, and you'll understand what "regulation" means.

Grandma's retirement savings has not been and will not be sabotaged because of the "rise of a new currency". Rather, it will be sabotaged because of all the decades of destructive actions her government took, coming home to roost.
Grandma *thinks* she did everything right -- but she was wrong, because she *obeyed* the people who were pilfering her hard work and selling the unborn with mounting debt. Worst of it all: She *wanted* that -- arguably she voted -- so now she gets to pay for that which she ordered. Grandma is not a kid -- she must, and she will, face the consequences of being indulgent, obedient, and apathetic.
Too bad. It is what it is. We have been predicting this scenario for decades. It will come to pass. What mathematically cannot continue will not continue.

 paycheck-to-paycheck strategy checks out
Pretend for the following text that it's 2011, and I'm going to give you guidance.
If you do this, and you have some tide-me-over funds for the few lossy 14-day pay periods, you will make an astounding 12.54% profit every 14 days.
**Proof**: 
Also, as it ought to be obvious, anyone who bought around the beginning of November has made -- in paper -- **RECORD**, never-ever-seen profits.
There are some pitfalls so you shouldn't just blindly follow this advice.  And, of course, you should be prepared for a prolonged crash where your coins will be worth less and less over the course of multiple pay periods.

Those estimates use the cost for CPU mining.  GPU mining, FPGA mining and ASIC mining uses orders of magnitude less power.
But let's assume you're right.
$68 thousand dollars is *a pittance*.  It certainly won't cure cancer.  It won't get you much protein folding.  You won't find little green men in Mars with that kinda money.  Heck, it can't even maintain a family of four alive during a year here in San Francisco, unless they are strictly Ramenvores.
As I asked you earlier, the question is *Bitcoin mining is expensive* **in comparison to what**?  Just uttering a dollar amount and implying "well *I* wouldn't spend my money on that" is **not an argument**.  It is only *your opinion*.  Which you're welcome to have, but then other people's money are not yours to spend, therefore the point you're trying to make by sharing your opinion is moot.
I humbly suggest having a more open mind, and asking more questions instead of making more claims.

Given the political circumstances, "Bitcoin in Argentina" is almost like a *different product* than "Bitcoin in Uruguay", because the circumstances in Argentina *artificially reduce* the supply of Bitcoin / *increase* the demand of Bitcoin, relative to Uruguay.  Even though the exact same bitcoins in your pocket phone don't magically transmute themselves when crossing the Uruguay-Argentina border, Argentinians on that side are willing to pay much more for them than Uruguayans on their side.  It's that simple. Same deal with "a Coke bottle in the desert" vs. "a Coke bottle in your fridge".

It also doesn't help your case that you open by telling me your opinion of how I sound, as if that mattered, or was a defense against your cultish beliefs.  But that's just another defense mechanism.  
I've seen far too many religious people being shaken to the core exactly like you are now.  First they "love their God", then they say "Sure I can conceive of a world without God, but how could life be possible without God", then -- in some cases -- the rest of the deconversion process follows.

Yes.  Which means that a currency's purchasing power is **only one factor among many** that is at play in the decision to spend or save the currency.
Which directly proves your theory wrong.   "People won't spend today if their money can get them more stuff tomorrow" is proven false directly by the observable reality of  "people ACTUALLY DO spend today EVEN if their money can get them more stuff tomorrow".

Not true, my man. There is widespread suppression of ideas in America. It may not be violent censorship like in China, but it still happens. There are quite a lot of things you CAN'T say in America without consequences. 
For example: if you say either of those things in America, people around you will quickly move to either manipulate you into silence or ostracize you into irrelevancy. Either you are made to shut up, or apologize for your ideas, or -- if you resist -- socially reduced to the status of a crazy person.
Or try this: try mentioning casually in conversation that taxation is theft, or suggesting that the category of human actions called "crimes" is almost entirely bogus. See how that goes.
America isn't China. America is ahead. In China, people are for the most part aware that they are being suppressed. In America, we have achieved the next step in mind control: the peasants themselves have been so thoroughly brainwashed, they instinctively collaborate to keep you in their mental pen.

This is just another event in the degeneration of "government" into total aggression -- things are only going to get worse.

Some of them don't know they are (the authoritarians who obey orders, just doin' m'job types, these are the kinds of people who executed Jews on command in Nazi  Germany), and some of them are fully aware of the criminality of their behavior (the psychopaths a.k.a. social dominants according to Bob Altemeyer's taxonomy, who give the orders and come up with the lies to make the orders appear virtuous).
We know they are deliberately malevolent because they routinely do things that would be called "crimes" (implying deliberate malevolence) if any one of us did them.  We know they are acting either under the delusion that when they perpetrate evil it's virtuous, or under the full knowledge that when they conspire to perpetrate evil they are guilty but they just don't give a shit.  "I'm really good at killing people", said the president lately... this does not strike me as an innocent moral confusion, but rather as psychopathy.
We should therefore not be  surprised when they perpetrate abominable acts such as violating private property to gain access to information that would have never been volunteered by their victims.  In fact, this is one of the most minor transgressions they could perpetrate.  We're talking about people who have conspired to mass murder brown people abroad, and cage millions of non-violent black and white people at home.  They will cage or murder you if you resist or disobey them.  And sometimes they will murder you for sport, as Al-Awlaki's nephew found out, and the thirteen year old boy discovered, both seconds before their deaths.
The question that you must ask yourself is: at which point do you stop believing in the virtue and authority of obviously malevolent and delusional people?  Does it even matter whether what they do is "illegal" or "legal", when they get to define that, through writing their magical pieces of paper, and through their own trampling of their own promises in said papers?
Ask yourself that question today, because tomorrow it might be too late -- you might be dead.  You need to remember that these people are willing to murder you if you disobey or resist them.  That is what they do, they do it righteously, they will do whatever the fuck they want to  increase their power over you, you must never forget that.  Start asking yourself how that could possibly be justified, so you can discover it cannot.

You wouldn't.  And that's okay.      While we transition to non-inflationary currency, you would probably choose to borrow in inflationary currency.  It's fine and nobody should judge you for that.
Still, people *do* borrow in Bitcoin *today*, and they *do* pay back (for the most part).  Which means VirtualCrap's original bullshit defamatory claim against BTCJam lenders is strictly **false**.

You would just ask if anyone would accept board game money for actual goods or services, they'll say no, and you'll then mention that, well, Bitcoin is accepted for many, many goods and services.
Then you would explain that value is not an attribute of a thing, but rather a relationship between the person and the thing -- asking him if his grandmother would sell her wedding band for the equivalent dollar price, and asking him whether he'd pay the same amount of money for a soda in the desert or for a soda after he drank two liters of water, to drive the point home.
From there, it's all easy because reality just slammed in his brain.  Always keep shit simple, explaining things in plain English of people doing things, and asking questions -- to discover toxic preconceptions -- as you go along.

Yes, of course, computer programs are not political... yet.  They will need to have  the equivalent of a conscience before we can call the behavior of the programs themselves "political".
But the people choosing to run the programs, however, **are very much political**, even if they don't realize it.  They literally support *running the libertarian values in a computer program*, whether they like it or not, whether they live in perpetual cognitive dissonance or not.
And that just fills my heart with joy.

This needs to be said more often.

Sorry, but none of that convinces me in any way of your claim that "the U.S.S.R. did not have Rule of Law".  All these examples of malevolence you gave happen in countries that allegedly "have Rule of Law" (like America).  All you've proven here is that the laws written in people living in the U.S.S.R. were just *different* from your ideal conception of what they ought to have been.  The five conditions in your definition of "Rule of Law" are mostly met by your examples; in the cases where they're *not* met, they're pretty much not met anywhere else in the world (so that explicitly disqualifies you from claiming that "Rule of Law" exists anywhere).
As far as what you've presented here, it's clear that those people acting under the name "U.S.S.R", all of them were all acting 100% under color of law, that is, under the belief that laws authorized them to do the malevolent. things they did.  Because "Sowjet" laws, in fact, did say they were authorized to do that.  Just as, in fact, "American" laws today do say that they authorize certain armed gunmen in costumes to shoot you if you resist them.
Not that I really care -- I've already told you that I consider "Rule of Law" to be nothing more than rule of men with lipstick and rituals.  That one you haven't disproven, and I suspect you won't be able to.

Not if, when getting out of jail, you still have all your riches.  See,


That's reasonable.  If everything you have can be stolen just because a Mob says so, then those things will necessarily be *less valuable* because there is a *risk* attached to them.
Bitcoin, however, is an exception to that... *when it is stored in a brainwallet*, of course.  People doing business as "government" can steal your car, your house, even your kids.  But they can't steal what they can't find, especially if it is in your brain.  They could even kill you... but you won't be funding their organized crime anytime soon.
If you can defer your consumption of the money you've made (you can) and you can keep it safe from their prying hands (you can), you can keep your wealth secure in a way that no other form of wealth has ever had.

This is a reasonable request.  Another comment of mine here already contains proof about Bitcoin lending.  As for Bitcoin merchants and purchasers, there's plenty on this subreddit, but I'll mention China Telecom and Bitpay's merchant page  .  Unless they are committing fraud by lying, you can infer they do have buyers.  About the investments that produce revenue, we have quite a few stocks denominated in Bitcoin, from online casinos to mining operations.  And, about the savers, well, I think it ought to be self-evident by asking anyone who is into Bitcoin whether they are saving those coins they bought or not.

The mag strip would contain what?  The private key?  This enables the merchant to steal the entirety of the funds tied to the private key.
So, in other words, it's similar to the system we have today.  But worse, because (1) the software in the POS needs to be upgraded to support this (2) there's no recourse if someone clones your private key.  You just lost the money and that's that.
It would be a different story if the card communicated via RFID / NFC / Bluetooth to generate a transaction that the payee's network node can push into the Bitcoin network.  But that requires two-way communication -- the payee's device must request a payment from the card, and then the card must generate the transaction and send it back to the device.

OP, you are correct when you say that "money laundering" is a made-up crime, in the sense that "money laundering" describes perfectly peaceful activities that aren't evil in the slightest, and thus shouldn't be punished by *making up crimes prohibiting these activities*.  You've made this point well, so I'll talk about something else happening in this thread.
I want to turn your attention to quite the interesting phenomenon.  Notice how you were attacked by numerous people here?  Most people fogged, equivocated, used sarcasm, called you names, and missed the unmissably obvious point you made.
I'm going to share the benefits of my experience and suggest that these people *know full well what you mean, know full well that you're right, and they mount these bully theatrics because they want you to shut the fuck up*.
Your article suggests there is a distinction between *actual crimes* (acts that are evil *and* also prohibited by authorities' orders) and *made-up crimes* (acts that are not evil at all, but just disobey authorities' orders).    Your article suggests that there exist acts that are perfectly good, yet they are prohibited by authorities' orders.  More importantly, your article suggests that punishing people for disobeying these orders is **evil**.
Which is a fair conclusion.  Surely debatable, even.
Now, if these people were half-decent, they would actually properly debate and address this *central point* of your article... *yet none did*. *None whatsoever*.
Why is it that they concertedly behaved in this destructive and anti-rational way?  
(Watch them attack me after I write what follows.)
Well, you see, these people are **authoritarians**.  Their Directive Zero of **obedience good, disobedience bad**.  Whatever the authorities say is good, "is good".  Whatever the authorities say is prohibited, "is highly evil and how dare you opine otherwise!".  Yes, for them, any particular act is not to be classified as right or wrong because of a set of moral principles -- it is simply "always *wrong*" if *the act contravenes an order from the people they perceive as authorities*.  These people are highly **servile**.
As you can probably imagine, just like with any other dirty family secret, **their Directive Zero is never to be discussed openly**.  This part of their identity, they know, is embarrassingly evil because it defends the indefensible.  Thus, Directive Zero needs to be *completely taboo*.  In fact, you are *not even supposed to notice* that they are authoritarians.
To that effect, they carefully construct a fake belief system to *pretend* that every time they agree with the authorities, no matter how evil their orders and actions are, there's "some good reason" for it... "reasons" that they memorize and spit back at you when you question one of the authorities' orders.  Cop shot an unarmed kid?  Don't worry!  I'm sure they'll do the necessary mental gymnastics to minimize or justify the actions of that costumed armed murderer.  After all, stupid kid had it coming.
You can see how this taboo creates a problem for them.  Your point is that attacking human beings merely for disobeying orders peacefully is *wrong*.  But this abomination is exactly what authoritarianism prescribes as *right and necessary*.  So how do they argue *for* the authoritarian evil of ruining peaceful and decent people who commit "money laundering", *without actually revealing their authoritarianism*?
Well, they behave *in exactly the same way they have behaved*.  They find ways to shut you up, sabotage your argument, apologize for the malevolence of the authorities they worship with ad-hoc excuses, and distract everyone from the central point... because, you see, the closer we get to addressing your central point, the closer they get to their taboo being on display for everyone else.
And if that means they will support peaceful people being thrown in cages for peaceful acts that aren't wrong in the slightest -- just disobedient -- well by golly they'll celebrate when these people are terrorized.
Now you see how corrupt and malevolent they are.

Everything that the people d.b.a. "United Nations" proclaim "is a right", you should safely assume that there's an automatic unstated magical exception for people d.b.a. "governments" to violate.
That is, if they declare that you have a "right to privacy" or a "right to life", you can assume that people d.b.a. "governments" will ultimately act as if they have slim to zero obligation to afford you that right.  That is, these villains *will* murder people, and they *will* spy on people, and they'll do all of that with total or near-total impunity.

People doing business as "Government" are in the business of scamming producers out of their money, skimming some off the top, then bribing parasites with it to gain favor with and obedience from the parasites, and caging / ruining / murdering those who resist or evade their scheme.
For that, they REQUIRE a monopoly in money printing that allows them to steal from everyone by devaluing existing money. Monopoly on money is indeed considered one of the core functions of "government" according to most everyone you can ask. Unless they can get you to believe that their pieces of paper are worth anything, their intaglio presses won't make them rich.

No godvernment will replace the previous one. Belief ends when no one believes -- otherwise any change is simply a change in name only.
Much has been written by voluntaryist authors on how such a transition would take place and how the open problems created by belief in government would be resolved (who owns what, et cetera). It is not my place to, nor could I, explain that work in a Reddit comment.




You just want them to change into believing in YOUR version of Godvernment. I don't consider that change.

Ah, yes, the "but the Don is so nice to you, why don't you want to pay your protection money?" argument.  I'm familiar with it.
The rest of your comment is a rehash of the old tired argument of "you're a thankless sonuvabitch who has all these nice things because these crooks stole trillions from everyone to provide you with these nice things, and how could you not have any shame?  Shame on you!"  It's the kinda thing that a shitty parent who demands money from his "ungrateful" children would say.
Unfortunately, I'm not your kid.
Suuuuuuuuuure, Uncle Tom from Best Korea.  You got all those nice things *only because* your gummint fairies made it possible.  Nothing good in the world could ever be possible if these fairies didn't bless everything with their approval and guidance.  Life itself would not be possible if people didn't give these thieves everything they demand, and we should all be thankful they don't demand more!  And those of us who see wrong with mass extortion, with locking people up for "not paying" for things that they didn't ask for and didn't want -- from bombing brown people to asset forfeiture to Tuskegee to perpetual inflation -- are all "bad men" who "deserve to be punished".  Yadda yadda.
*I know the speech.*  It's *boring*.  Exactly like listening to a Christian babble about how all the world's wonders wouldn't exist without their God Yahweh, and how I should believe in the Lord Jeeeezus Christ because he loves me so much.
Here's the cold hard truth.  Your belief system ascribing supernatural powers and exceptional morality to gangsters?  I don't share it.  I *know* I'm not going to go to hell for disbelieving in your Godvernment.  I'm not scared.  My heathen disbelief irritates you.  I know.  *I don't care*.
I believe that the people you defend and fund bomb children and cage millions peaceful human beings.  I believe that, not because I *want* to, but because I can't look at the world and deny what I seee.  I believe that shitless-scared people like you make such malevolence possible, because I know these evils wouldn't be possible if there weren't idiots like you willing to fund these criminals.  This irritates you even more, *because you know it's true*.
But... what can I do about your funding of organized criminal sociopaths?  Not much.  I can point out that you're *willingly* funding them, and I can show how you're therefore co-responsible, but you clearly believe that *everything* these sociopaths do is ultimately sacrosanct, and if children die and grown men rot in cages, well you're callous enough to find an excuse for that.
So, if you want to pay for bombing brown children, and you believe that without you paying, the world would be Mad Max with Mohaws and Motorcycles, you are free to believe that and continue funding such criminal genocide.  That's cool.  It's *your* cross to bear, and *your* belief system based on guilt and terror.  Not mine.
**But I won't**.  And **I certainly won't be browbeaten by an uppity stranger into sharing his criminal belief system**.  Every penny I deny these criminals?  **You will pay**.  Call me a "hypocrite" all you want, you're still the one demonstrably and willingly funding the largest terrorist group who kills the most people.  My conscience is fine with that.  And this shall burn you forever.
Now, do you have something that would *persuade me*?  Bring it on.  But so far, believe me, shitty guilt trips based on delusions and vague terror threats aren't cutting it.

You're doing the religious thing now, where they redefine existence (moving the goalposts -- "existence means one thing but in this case it magically means another") to protect their belief of "God exists" from rational questioning. That's clear bullshitter behavior. It is further evidence to me that you are being irrational (perhaps because you want to save face and "look right") rather than actually being right). You even contradict yourself by going back what you said in the previous paragraph. Ugh.

People who did business as "The U.S.S.R." could never even have dreamed about the totalitarian and murderous society that "The U.S." thugs have successfully built with total impunity, and with worshippers like (to the extent that I can see) you, who think that pieces of paper authorize these organized criminals to operate with total impunity, so long as they follow the papers they themselves made up.

@_date: 2013-11-14 22:34:33
Now it's public:
@_date: 2013-03-22 03:37:39
 here is how this works.  I've done my threat modeling so I'll share the conclusions.
Wallets are composed of many addresses (public keys) together with their corresponding private keys.
A Bitcoin address is anonymous until such time that you give it to someone else, either by paying or by receiving.
To be punished for the made-up bullshit sin of "money laundering" or "capital gains tax evasion", assuming there is no video evidence of you *using your money peacefully in ways that your rulers haven't authorized*, they need to incontrovertibly link an address of yours to you.
They can't do that if you follow all of these practices:
- You use a new address every time you receive money.
- You mix every coin that you get from compromised persons (people who *will* report your address and identity to the criminals that want to steal from you, which include exchanges and other snitches, mostly).
- You mix coins in any address of yours that was used to send money to compromised persons.
To mix coins, you create a new address and then you use a **coin mixer** to send your money to the newly-created address.  This way, you are exchanging your coins with someone else's, at a very small fee.  You gain plausible deniability for the price you pay with this arrangement.  There are a few, but you should not use any U.S. based services since they are now under threat of caging to record every transaction and report most of them (see the mafia called FinCEN).
This gives rise to a scheme in which you not only *don't reuse addresses*, but also keep **separate, always-firewalled addresses**.   Discipline is key.  (1) You always receive coins to a fresh **public** address that you will reveal to your counterparty.  (2) Then you safekeep those coins you want to keep in long-term storage, by putting them into a **private** wallet.  Any coins going into your **private** wallet **must** be mixed first.  (3) Any divestitures from your **private** wallet into **any other address**, yours or otherwise, *must be mixed* too, *unless* you have reason to believe that the recipient would **never** betray your trust (which means your identity might have been compromised, and you must mix the contents of the private source address wallet again).
This way, from the point of your adversary, immediately after you bought coins, the money just "vanished".  No "capital gains" liability, no way to track your expenses, no "laundering" accusations.  They can't prove anything, because the money is not tied to you and they can't prove you sold anything, much less the age of what you sold (necessary for them to prove and "assess capital gains").  For all they know, your money is as good as gone, in limbo, so you can't possibly "profit" from it vis-a-vis their Monopoly papers, so they can't "charge" you with any "crime".  At worst, you will have to surrender the "income tax" that these criminals demand, but *only* for whatever actual *income* they can prove from any address you gave to compromised persons.  Couple this with zipped lips and full disk encryption, when you get out of the cage they will want to throw you in, you'll still have what's yours.
Most wallets don't allow you to control which addresses are used to send money, and will happily mix source addresses when you send funds.  **You don't want this.**  You want a wallet with *coin control* that allows you to specify source addresses, or else you want to juggle with multiple wallets, so long as the private wallets / addresses can **never** be tied to **you** (see above).  If you use a regular wallet (only one address, or mixing source addresses) you run the risk of "tainting" one address with others.
With this, you can be safe in the knowledge that **nobody who wants to harm you can tie any money to you**, and nobody can prove that you "laundered" anything or that you "owe any capital gains tax".
Unless they start calling mixing services "launderers", which, if I read the tea leaves correctly, is in the works.
Also, **never be flashy with expenditures you can't explain to bully criminals without revealing your private financial information**.
 you don't tell anyone, can't be used by anyone to hurt you.

Satoshi has actually spoken about the reason for Bitcoin at length, and his comments are PGP signed.  He invented Bitcoin to create a store of value that could not be inflated or controlled by bankers.  The [very genesis block]( mentions [an article that talks about the bank bailouts](  He's also spoken about how "people of the Libertarian persuasion" would find his invention very attractive (and he was correct, look around at all of us).
You may not have known to date what the creator's purpose of Bitcoin was, but I assure you, there is a purpose, like it or not it's highly political, and it will change the world.

They start with the conclusion, and then get to the premises necessary to resolve the cognitive dissonance, after which they will insist on those conditions no matter how hard reality refutes them.  And if you press the matter, then they become abusive as a way to resolve their cognitive dissonance.

It's a given that such a scenario will happen, for sure. The only question is when.
The reason they need to do this, is that Bitcoin allows you to (1) stash your wealth, pack up your bags, and leave the tax plantation ("country") (2) stop the plantation owners (the people d.b.a. "government") from stealing from you.
This is a disaster scenario for the plantation owners. It is so, because the only collateral of their massive debt is tax control of their negroes: you, your parents, your children, your friends.
Without this collateral, the whole house of cards falls down. That is why the organized racketeers cannot allow that.
And this is why you'll see the amount of punishments for acts involving Bitcoin gradually go **up**, until only the super rich (traditionally the only people to enjoy magical exceptions to the rules of the plantation) are allowed to do anything significant with them.

And you didn't.  But the fact remains that you understand wars would not be waged if the warmongers didn't have money to spend at their disposal.  So:
- Either you *willingly funded* people you *knew* were going to murder strangers.  That certainly makes you an *accomplice*.
- Or you knew they would terrorize you if you didn't pay up, and that's why you paid up.  That makes you a *victim of extortion*.
**You can't have it both ways.**
So what, exactly, are you?
If you're an accomplice, then rest assured I don't want to talk to you, because talk won't persuade a person who willingly funds the murders of other human beings.
If you're a victim of extortion -- like I am, and all of my loved ones are -- why do you think that groveling to the people who steal your money will change *anything*?  How many more decades of groveling do you need to experience before you're convinced that murderers are gonna murder, and if they need your money to continue, they'll just take it?
How can you possibly think that a person, or a group, who says "I need 4 out of 12 months' work from you, so I can spend 2 of those months in murdering strangers you've never seen, and if you don't pay, I will ruin you and throw you in a dungeon" **understands your plights**?  How is this belief any different from a Stockholm Syndrome sufferer's belief that "I know deep down my husband really loves me"?
They don't give a shit, dude.  You're a cow to them, ready for the milkin', and if you're too much trouble, they'll sacrifice you.  Your belief that groveling to them will change things, is only a self-defeating way of not doing anything about the problems you know exist.

The social contract is a delusion. If you think it's real, then you should be able to demonstrate it with ***facts***. Otherwise you're arguing the same delusional and stupid non sequitur "because you live in Jerusalem you agree that God exists" nonsense.
Yes, excuse me but saying "because you live in X, you signed a contract that says you must obey all the orders that certain costumed people give you, and if you resist, the magical contract authorizes them to cage you", is retarded.

Voting **is** asking.
I understand there is this belief that voting is somehow virtuous and necessary, and that you're in control.
That isn't the case. Just one look at the facts of what voting causes, to you and others, shows it's not.
When you vote, you're literally telling someone "I will give you power to boss me around, to take my money whether I want to or not, to assault me if I resist, and to do the same things to everyone else... if you just pretty please do these favors you promised for me. On, but you have no obligation to deliver those promises."
So, voting gets you a system where they don't have to do anything, but you have to do everything they order, and if you don't, they can ruin you and throw you in a cage. In such a system, who, exactly is in control?  You're clearly not in control, Uncle Tom. *They* are.
Seems not just like a shitty deal all-around, but also highly undignified of a human being to demand that he be ordered around and punished (including death) it he disobeys.
To me, that's sad, really.

Your explanation is in error, and I do not accept it.  I will now show what the error is:


This pretense relies on the erroneous belief that two copies of the same thing A and A' are one and the same A, and therefore copying one thing is equivalent to stealing.
Which is absurd.  One moment's look into the "logic" behind your error makes it painfully obvious:
If you have a chair C and I copy the chair (making C'), I obviously have not stolen your chair -- I have a new chair C', which is *mine*, that is exactly like *your* chair C, but is not the same chair as C, and therefore does not deprive you of *your* chair C (which would be stealing).
If I then proceed to give my chair C' away to someone, you might have lost a potential sale of your chair C, but I did not harm you in any way.  Nor did I ever rob you of C, so your conclusion that I have stolen C from you by copying C to C' is obviously not supported by any evidence (and, some would say, legally slanderous).
Your conclusion that you are harmed when someone copies something you have is wrong, because you are relying on deduction from a more basic error.
Krackor's right and I fully support him in non-violently making as many copies of as many things as he would like.
Sorry mate.  Better luck next time.

They have all the evidence to secure your ass into a cage:
1. You sent money from your bank account into an exchange.
2. The money never went back, so presumably you bought bitcoins for yourself.
3. You went abroad.
4. You never filed an FBAR detailing these coins.

If they publish a piece friendly to Bitcoin, all the advertisers who stand to lose money from the audience as they flock to their competition (Bitcoin) would stop advertising there. Additionally, any government sources hostile to Bitcoin adoption would dry up.

History says otherwise.  He was afforded all those powers -- including emergency and war powers -- *by the people who voted for him*.  Had people not voted for him, he would not have had these powers.  So no.
Reality is not debatable with me, especially not with these tailored-to-fit "exceptions to democracy".  **The Third Reich was unquestionably a democratic regime**.  You don't get to deny it, making up excuses, to protect your faith in democracy, just because it so happens that democratic regimes mass murder people.  *They do*.  Deal with it.
 you honestly believe in democracy, then you necessarily must defend its consequences.  You don't get to deny that democracy historically took place, when the consequences of democracy don't fit your doctrine.  To do so, is no different in irrationality than to say "God works in mysterious ways" to explain away a disaster or a rape.


Actually, the Putsch failed.  He became a jailed man, not a dictator.  **Then he went the democratic route, and gained power that way.**  What you just quoted just adds more facts that disprove your theory.

Game theory says no.  Suppose people anonymize their coins through any method (including Zerocoin).  After several iterations, the rational endgame of the CoInvalidation scam side, is to *necessarily* mark every new address as "dirty" by default.  Voila, you mix your coins, you just "lost" that money for purposes of spending it on any business which subscribes to the scam.  Of course, CoInvalidation can never start defaulting to "dirty", because they'd be dead in the water as soon as they start, since none of their customers would be able to get revenue if all coins are "dirty".

Bitcoin resolves the **most important ethical question** of our time: 
Thanks to encryption, people can now *effectively protect their wealth* from the predation of the largest gang of violence monopolists. Honest people who were previously forced to work six months of the year for these gangsters, now can work for themselves, then move away from the sphere of influence of the gangsters. 
Those who get threatened by the criminals can finally say NO, and still keep what's theirs from the gangsters, whereas before the gangsters would have stolen or broken everything their victims owned. Of course, the gangsters will escalate their terror threats... which only serves to demonstrate to the public at large who the real crooks are... and still nets them zero payoff for their terrorism.
This is huge. This is literally the first time something like this has ever happened in about ten thousand years. The only way can be improved upon this wealth protection mechanism, would be an as-of-today still magical protection shield that made you invulnerable to physical force.
That, the fact that Bitcoin can restrict exchanges to exclusively voluntary and nonviolent ones, makes me extremely happy.

Socialists (understood in this comment as the social democrats that have hijacked the term socialism) will never like Bitcoin. 
Socialists support stealing from people to pay for the allegedly "charitable" expenses of gangsters doing business as "government". 
The fact is that Bitcoin allows people to protect themselves and their property against said government theft.
The Bitcoin endgame is a single one: the revelation that government is merely a gang of bullies and thieves prepared do do absolutely everything necessary, no matter how abominable and despicable, to get away with their acts. 
In that sense,  Bitcoin works directly against socialists' professed goals and institution of worship. Bitcoin and socialism are therefore mortal enemies.

This was my earlier analysis:
In short, like the trolley "moral" dilemma, everyone is busy arguing whether the fat man should be pushed onto the train tracks, or screaming that "this other person is evil because he answers differently".  But *nobody ever asks* who tied the people to the train tracks.
Interesting, eh?
In reality, we can never know what DPR would have done, had he *not* been confronted with the possibility that his life, and the lives of many others, might have been ruined by people betraying him.
We can never know, because that possibility was *twice* fraudulently posed upon him by people who wished him harm.  *I* know I wouldn't have done what he did, but I  *also* know that the people who have him kidnapped right now are far, far more evil and willing to murder disobedient people than DPR himself is or might be.
We can never know, because the moral equation already had faulty values to begin with -- the decades of terrorism against drug users and sellers and buyers has already been perpetrated.  DPR is just another casualty of the War on People.
This, of course, does not excuse the two DPR's choices we're discussing right now.

Isn't that because **the corn used to make it, is subsidized by government**?
Oh, but, bah, surely I am being silly here. There's no way that subsidizing a product can make its derivatives cheaper, right? I'm sure corn syrup is cheaper because of "magic", or because corn syrup producers are an evil cartel scheming to poison everyone with their sweet sugary diabeetus-causing deliciousness. At least that's what government worshipper doctrine tells me. I'm sure food manufacturers switched from cane sugar to corn syrup in the 80's because they wanted to up their evil a notch, and not because that's when the subsidies started to have an effect in corn sugar prices.
Short and sweet. Haha.
I swear, some people will truly say **anything**, no matter how **absurd** or **contrary to observable reality**, to protect their superstitions. Deny cause and effect. Transpose effect and cause. Equivocate and use sophisms. It always excites me to see people frantically scrambling around to cover up the naked emperor.

Your interlocutor is **right**. bitcoind is way less CPU intensive than a combination of nginx and PHP, or Plone and Varnish. Even if it weren't, a properly setup KVM VPS will use control groups in the host to constrain all forms of resource usage -- including disk bandwidth -- so that guests cannot ruin other guests' performance. If their hosts aren't set up this way, then they are negligent and shitty VPS operators.

Quoting verbatim for posterity:




Here you have it, ladies and gents: binlargin has no problem advancing a "theory of evil" that literally defines **Adolf Hitler and Yusuf Stalin as "not evil"**, and the Holocaust / the Purges as "unpleasant".  This is not two comments after he claimed that there is "no correct" way to decide what's evil.
How duplicitous, how farcical, how corrupt, how addled in his brain, must a person be, that he's willing to *completely discredit himself with the most risible of statements, contradicting something he said not a half hour ago*, **just so he can continue to deny to himself that he wants people's lives to be ruined**, and that such actions are **evil** and obviously *intolrable in a decent society*?  I'm sure if he's in the mood, he can convince himself that rape isn't evil either, because it's "for a greater good".
This has got to be the "work" of a man that is *so completely oblivious* to his own thoughts and emotions, that he literally cannot reason any of his thoughts before uttering them.  No wonder this man can't bring himself to help his "friends" when they are in need -- he can't fucking think a single thing straight, how is he going to figure out how to help others be productive? 
See, people, this is the kind of revolting moral turpitude, the level of dogmatic denialism, the apology for corruption and malevolence, that I see here every day.
Excuse me, I'm going to take an antiemetic.

Not honest, not an argument.

Statist "logic":
I'm militant.  I have zero firearms, I don't advocate aggression against anyone.
The people I criticize are not militant.  They control the vast majority of weapons, the *milita*ry works for them, and their subjects' minds such that, if they have someone killed / ruined / assaulted, they are perceived as virtuous.
See how statist "logic" works?  Up is down, aggressive is peaceful, good is evil, anti-militant is militant. Cult-induced localized schizophrenia.

You really *do* believe that you know *better than politicians* how their corrupt game is played. You think you got it all figured out, that they won't see your novel "masterful" manipulation, and that they will fall right in your Bitcoin trap.
You are a person who didn't fool millions and has no power whatsoever, who has some Bitcoin.  They are career professional manipulators who trick people into parting with millions of dollars and millions of votes, and keep *billions of human beings* calling inflated pieces of paper "money" and precious metals "funny money", and have rap sheets that would destroy *your* reputation, but still *somehow* have the power to make *your* money illegal.
You want me to believe that you can *manipulate them* if we only followed your brilliant scheme?  You yourself call politics "insane" and you want us all to sit at *that* table?
You made me smile for real.

It's already 0.5%. The model assumes 1% for simplicity. In time, if Bitcoin is indeed superior to gold (as you see from the feature list), you can assume it will slide to 100% or somewhere close.
Models are models. To call a model "bullshit" because your arbitrary and unreasoned assumption doesn't match the model's reasonable assumption, is to misunderstand what a model is.

**Yes, there is**.  On Linux there is.
The first and easiest way to do it is to run your Bitcoin client as another user (by way of sudo), and making sure that the home directory of that user has permissions 0700.  Most Linux desktops let you execute programs as another user (I know that KDE lets me type a command in its Alt+F2 minicli and click on a button that lets me specify another user and password).  Be ware that other applications in your current desktop session may be snooping for clipboard, keyboard and mouse I/O, or screenshots, and thus steal your passwords that way (but not your wallet files).  This vulnerability will be solved with the advent of Wayland as a replacement for X11.
The second way to do it is to use a MAC (mandatory access control) system such as SELinux (Fedora) or AppArmor (Ubuntu).  If you write a policy such that all applications are denied access to a set of directories / files / role objects, but your Bitcoin wallet software is allowed access to said files, *and* only a few select applications are allowed to communicate with the wallet software, then you are golden.  The same graphical display vulnerability applies, but at least SELinux provides for access controls on windowing environment objects.  The drawback of this technique is that it's a bitch to implement.
The first technique cannot protect you against a root exploit.  The second technique has been proven effective in mitigating and / or stopping even root exploits.

I can see how you'd associate these tasks with networking per se, but I respectfully don't agree with that expansive definition of the concept.  I'd call that firewalling or throttling.   Networking to me is what you do *before* you do firewalling and throttling.
Most CCNA type people believe that networking is typing commands in an ASA prompt.  I don't share that view.

I think you get a hard-on whenever the organized criminals you worship harm and punish decent people.
I think you're fundamentally incapable of judging people as human beings with character flaws and virtues, and therefore you fall back on judging them by the Bible of Rules written by the criminals you worship.
I think all these things based on my previous interactions with you.  I also think that anyone who looks at your comment history will immediately agree with my assessment of your worthlessness as a human being.

Well, can you produce credible evidence that you no longer possess the asset?  "I pinky swear, Madam Consular Official" isn't gonna cut it.  "Nothing under this sleeve, nothing under the other" doesn't cut it either.  May I remind you that the standard of proof in these cases is **preponderance of evidence**, so if you can't prove credibly that you no longer hold the asset in question, then you look **exactly** like any other tax evader.

I see nothing in your comment that would change my mind, only a number of unsubstantiated claims.  I'm sorry, but you haven't persuaded me.
If you want to persuade me, you could start by, for example, providing a definition of "money laundering" that does not rely on papers written by the organized criminals we're discussing here ("government").  You could also enhance your argument by showing that you can distinguish between *wrongs* (which we both agree we're against) and "crimes" (which we need to agree they are just disobedience to certain orders, and do not necessarily imply wrong from the person accused of it)
That way we can have a meaningful discussion of *facts* and people's *actions*, instead of rambling about other people's opinions ("action X is a crime").  I'm not interested, surely you can tell, in discussing the contents of magical papers.
I look forward to seeing you engage me.
