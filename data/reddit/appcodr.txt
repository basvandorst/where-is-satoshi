That's insane. You can listen to expert speakers for free 24/7 on youtube. And the fact that they don't offer a bitcoin payment option tells a lot about their conference.
@_date: 2015-12-11 22:40:18
If this was true, we would be seeing an steady/exponential growth. The fact that BTC price touched $500 then went all the way back to $300s, and now slowly moving past $400 debunks this MMM theory.

No one is watching those videos, looks like they are just being instructed to publish some bullshit videos. Most of them look southeast asians. If that was true, we would be seeing huge volume from Southeast Asia, which is not the case. OP's theory seems more plausible, plus, China is increasingly enforcing capital controls.

Why would you want the Foundation to have the rights of patents? The only ones that would make money off of patents would be the Foundation members themselves.
The goal should be to prevent anyone from patenting bitcoin related stuff. Is this even possible, like releasing to public domain so no one can patent it?
@_date: 2015-12-12 02:27:57
If it's so big in Southeast Asia and they all use bitcoin, why don't we see the huge volume coming from there?

Best approach: 
1) generate a bitcoin address and put on your site. 
2) start receiving payments to this address, without changing the address on every transaction.
3) when it reaches a certain amount, send all BTC you received in this address to another address and put a new address on the site.

They are using cheques as paper money. Can't they do this with normally dated cheques too? For example, I write a cheque today, write the current date, and the receiver can cash it OR pass it on. Date doesn't matter right?
@_date: 2015-12-20 16:55:16
You introduce snippets of code in your workflow, you increase the possible points of failures.
What's the problem of receiving more than one payment at the same address? Until he doesn't spend from this address and keeps the private key offline, there's no difference in security of one address vs many addresses.
The approach I described is perfectly fine for most small businesses.
And I actually didn't get what was your context in your second bullet point.

Do you really want to create a hard fork? For what? Bigger blocks? LOL that's a really stupid reason to hard fork. Hard forks should be used only as a last resort after the very last resort has been used.
@_date: 2017-02-04 15:57:24


@_date: 2017-02-04 15:38:28
Neither chain will die, that's 110% sure, in fact, hard forking will incentive even more hard forks in the future, making the whole thing collapse. 
That's why you never do hard forks. Ever.

This is not software development. This is a social development. You cannot have a currency if you make people believe that it will be "hard forked" tomorrow.

Building a system and ignoring that there will be stupid users is even more dumb.

Did you know that Satoshi created bitcoin to fight against owners of ATM networks?

But this will confuse people, some exchanges will start dealing with classic while others will keep trading bitcoin core, people will have to know which one they are using. Not to mention those who already have bitcoin, will end up having coins in both versions.

What? It was Mike Hearn who started the smear campaign against bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-01-19 00:41:43
You don't understand the basics man. If 99% of people use 2mb, it does not mean that the same 99% will not be using Bitcoin Core at the same time. Can you get now how this can have catastrophic consequences? I think Core should make clear that the 2mb is an altcoin.

What's up with all these 1 day accounts trying to pad the opinions in favor of bu. 
@_date: 2016-01-18 06:22:26
The problem with Bitcoin Classic is not the first hard fork. 2MB is fine probably. The problem is what are they going to do AFTER they succeed in taking control of the protocol. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 09:23:47
1 day account yeah...
@_date: 2016-01-15 15:50:09
So are you saying that XT's success depended on r/Bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-01-03 02:59:04
The question then is, do people have to understand Bitcoin complexity in order to use it?
@_date: 2016-01-18 13:07:39
Technically yes, you're correct. It means that Bitcoin Classic is nothing more than an altcoin. But if all infrastructure goes with it, it's just like taking control of the protocol.

Cold storage has its fair share of risks too:
- user can lose the paper/whaterver
- someone can steal the paper/whatever
- user could mess up the cold storage process and BTC end up in limbo
- user could be generating his cold storage with a compromised computer and have all his coins swept
... i'm sure there are more.

What I said is that it was not because some crack down on some ponzi that made the SEC classify crypto as money. And even if it was, I couldn't care less about SEC. The SEC is a problem for americans who have less freedom than north koreans.

Siliconangle.com? WTF is that? Maybe someone posted there just so they can say "oh look you don't need to do anything we are already doing". Bullshit.


Bullshit again, it was not because of this that the SEC classified crypto as money, and even then, what's the problem with that, Bitcoin was created as a form of money anyways and I couldn't care less what the SEC does, I'm not american.

Ok I guess the other replies didn't get what you are asking.
Are you sure you could turn off 2FA and proceed with the withdrawal? Maybe they will ask for the master key when 2FA is disabled?
But maybe if you're already logged in through 2FA, then withdrawing with 2FA wouldn't increase security that much.

Vitalik exchanged 100,000 ETH for cash. That pretty much tells whether he thinks ETH is a store of value.

No, it's because there is no risk of chargebacks or someone telling you later that the transaction was cancelled. No one can cancel your transaction if you do it in person.

Wrong, they don't have the brand and neither the exchanges' support. You ignore that people don't buy bitcoin from them, they buy at the exchanges. So that's why it's important to not fold for their intentions. They have the hash power but without the exchanges, they will end up hashing a useless altcoin.
