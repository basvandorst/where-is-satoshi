Do you think they could be related?
I've already looked at this angle, and they are both in the US. Some refs between here and there, but i think its coincidental.. Don't trust me because i haven't really gone down this end.. Do let me know if you find anything.  Any statisticians would weigh in on the chances of surname(s). The comments on this page show some interaction with one, but it doesnt "sound" or "look" like family; if you know what i mean: 
I hope i understood you.. were you implying there could be other family involved with the same name?

Taking copies as you go? Broken links. [As i have said]( the university is disavowing him. 
Aaaaannd recovered: 
This is ridiculous. Literally chasing caches for the past several days.

Sorry, i had another commenter open. They all look alike :-)
I'll give you one more because my mistake. Please refer to 
"This post goes to those cowards who sit behind anonymity on the web and cast doubt and aspersions about people whilst hiding. I note that most defamatory comments are anonymous. Cowards!
An anonymous poster stated that there are doubts with my qualifications. Anonymity is the shield of cowards, it is the cover used to defend their lies. My life is open and I have little care for my privacy - so in my case this is an easy charge to defend."

Just a hypothetical: Since you have virtually no control over how your taxpayer money is spent, would you rather have it spent on bitcoin or military complex and weapons development?
@_date: 2015-12-12 12:00:49
oo oo, i forgot to ask, if you can drop a short script of how you did this, i would appreciate.

 .. Removed already.. Copy?

I can't reply to the SGI issue because that will take a significant amount of research which few seem to care about.
@_date: 2015-12-11 21:05:50
Believe everything you read without sources?
1. a. He had a phd in theology. b. The university is distancing itself from him. c. How do you know they are telling the truth?
2. i'll give you a few to gnaw on: a. he could have purchased default/old sgi stock/chassis and fitted them with phi. b. do you know exactly where and how he mentions sgi?

British is not a language... Satoshi wouldn't be that stupid to say something like that.
@_date: 2015-12-11 17:17:07
I wouldn't take their word for it. They could be trying to distance themselves from an inquiry and bad press.
@_date: 2015-12-11 19:49:05
sorry, removed what? i'll put it back if remember what it was.
"legit" in what sense? please link to topics so i may dispute there :-)

Is this some of Craig's security writing? 
Anyone have a copy?
@_date: 2015-12-11 17:29:08
I do believe he has enough knowledge, and most of you that say he doesn't are either stupid or pompous. 
Masterclass in supercomputing?  How many people do you know have xeon phi skills? Have you watched the videos? How much have you really looked into this guy?
 
I have doubts whether he is individually Satoshi. It's likely the paper was edited by Kleiman.
Academics always seem to chime in with he just doesnt seem smart enough. However, i would contend that most academic code is half baked garbage and its more likely a practical group people created bitcoin. Note the paper is not in holy LaTeX.

Which timestamps do you suspect are faked?
@_date: 2015-12-11 19:57:08
Thanks, I saw that, but what i was asking was where did that word come from or why is it particular to John Burroughs School?
@_date: 2015-12-09 07:49:56
Interesting: 






Seems Ian Grigg knew something about this as he tagged him in the tweet.... 
@_date: 2015-12-11 22:33:54
I have my suspicions about that letter of endorsement and its purpose. Do check the author in the pdf metadata. 
Just don't throw out the whole loaf because one part is burnt.
Also do realize that article you linked didn't actually ask Greg; the signer of that endorsement.
@_date: 2015-12-11 18:55:56
refresh because i'm going to do rolling updates on this. take your time. pen and paper. do inquire if there is something you don't understand. i'm sure i have plenty to clear it up.
@_date: 2015-12-13 01:43:28
There is something called trying to hard... I believe you are trying to hard to fantasize...
Let's say you are Satoshi... Why are you abandoning bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-12-11 21:32:09
It's possible. Think of it another way: Who would believe you if you walked into a room and said "I'm satoshi?"
"They no longer listen" could also mean they simply have no interest in this thing called bitcoin. Or could be the typical feeling of jadedness teachers acquire.
I have a feeling (and hunches mean shit) that a student is involved in some of the extortion.
@_date: 2015-12-11 18:34:05
Timestamps and subject.
@_date: 2015-12-11 20:55:47
It was once accepted the world was flat. Please provide at least some form of evidence or something other than "widely accepted" to rebut.
Yeah the call for "or GTFO".. How childish. Do you think the man has time for that now?
@_date: 2015-12-11 20:09:02
Dude, I did. All i can say is ~~i see you are heavily invested in satoshi=szabo and~~ your reddit life starts out with basically "he's a con man" while i'm starting out with he's likely part satoshi (possibly involved in con deals). The major issues i see with any of your arguments is 1. "I dont really know anything about IT certifications" 
and 2. You don't have a copy of his videos, and even if you did, i'm not sure you'd understand them.
He built some serious machines. I've seen boxes of phi.
~~Sorry, at this point im going to have to dismiss you.~~
@_date: 2015-12-11 20:58:57
This is obviously a conflicted individual. Obviously with a more complex personality than you can imagine. Please sit down and read his blog. 
Satoshi seems nothing alike because as the letter to Dave says "I need your help and need a version of me to make this work that is better than me." 
@_date: 2015-12-11 21:42:40
I do, and believe me when i say I didn't stop researching until i could get rid of that type of prejudice. You can't always look at someone and know they are dodgy. 
If you are particular about his clothing; do remember he had to at least look like a professor at some point, and remember he did have to look like a businessman at some point, too..
AU businessmen have a tendency to appear like dodgy car salesmen because in that's what the outback does to one's face/skin similar to a car lot. 
The dodgy car salesmen you are referring to have an appearance more like this: 
You appear to be young and have no clue or experience having things taken from you (by fraud). Anyone who states they can detect them hasn't lived a life long enough. 
Please provide evidence to your statements besides your magical ability to detect fakes and frauds from a mile off.

Haus; thats a new one. :-) I like it, but I'm lazy and busy, care to share the etymology?
@_date: 2015-12-11 22:38:43
Craig stated that the ATO (or someone there) had it out for him. Vendettas are nothing new and using public office to execute them is nothing new (refer the last several US wars). That money is for bitcoin research as intended by the trust. I'm sure he had to pull some loops to move millions into a project.
Has not been proven a fake until they ask the signer of the letter under oath and not the current COO who needs to protect his business.
As i mentioned elsewhere there is reason to believe someone at the university (possibly a student or alumni) could also have it out for him.
@_date: 2016-05-02 10:02:43
Thinking the same thing... 
It was just rewritten from "I confirm as member." to "I confirm Kleiman was a member of the team."
