Sorry but if the dollar collapses, there would be tens if not hundreds of millions of deaths and widespread anarchy. It is not in anyone’s best interest to have that happen despite what you may think it will do to Bitcoins price. Bitcoin can coexist with the dollar but if the most widely used currency in the world and maybe human history collapses, EVERYONE loses. It’s a delusion to think otherwise.

That isn’t true, it has been repeatedly stated by Chinese officials that it is legal to own Bitcoin.

They aren’t leaving, they are just making a version of Binance that will be compliant with US regulation. If anything, it’s a good sign for the future that the decision makers at Binance see room to work within the regulatory framework.

Wouldn’t arbitrage from other trading pairs absorb pump attempts by Tether anyway? $1 bil is like 0.3% of the total crypto market cap so it wouldn’t be able to move the price in such a manner as we have been seeing...

Looks like a reference to the flash crashes that Bitcoin occasionally experiences to me, but kind of a stretch.

Ethereum and Bitcoin are two very different things, and to ignore Ethereum is foolish. I’d say something like 50/50 BTC/ETH portfolio but to not have ANY diversification even in crypto isn’t the best idea.

They would handle trade in Yuan, not dollars. Do you really think China would rather have their most important finances in an immutable currency they have very little if any control over? Why would they give up on their own currency that they completely control?
Edit: got Yen and Yuan mixed up

Aka this technology will be used to replace the individual employees at these banks and automate existing processes, not because they think Bitcoin is going to distrust them.
@_date: 2019-07-02 17:46:51
Without buying and selling, the price wouldn’t move. How can the price go higher if literally nobody is willing to sell at the higher price? The price would just stagnate.
@_date: 2019-07-07 15:08:02
Because Ethereum is the pioneer of smart contracts, something that Bitcoin has no relation to. Comparing Bitcoin and Ethereum is like comparing apples to oranges and to say only one or only the other is short sighted.

People are downvoting you because you shouldn’t have 5 BTC on an exchange to begin with unless you are willing to accept that this shit can happen but instead you are complaining about it on reddit.

Lol only after they confiscated millions of dollars worth of mining rigs.
@_date: 2019-07-07 17:34:54
I keep all of my crypto on a hardware wallet so I would never have this issue. If I keep anything on an exchange, it’s a small amount and usually temporary so the likelihood of anything going wrong is a lot lower.
@_date: 2019-07-07 18:27:55
I already own Bitcoin and have looked into Lightning, I don’t see where you’re going with your comment. There is no reason why you should only own a single asset in any asset class.
@_date: 2019-07-04 16:49:16
If those coins moved, the price of Bitcoin would definitely crash.
@_date: 2019-07-10 21:01:28
The alternative, keeping all of your savings in Bitcoin, is foolish. Bank accounts are insured by the US government (to a certain point) and if the US government is unable to follow through on that guarantee, Bitcoin price will be the least of everyone’s worries.
@_date: 2019-07-02 23:19:21
Honestly such a good analogy lol

If you were gullible enough to think Elon Musk was giving away Bitcoin if you sent him some, no amount of regulation would save you. Even with regulation, a fool will ALWAYS be parted from their money. Just take this as a learning experience and stop trying to get rich quick. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
@_date: 2019-07-30 15:41:27
But China can enforce the value of their currency with their industrial and military might, same as the US with the dollar, where Bitcoin relies on people collectively assigning it value.
@_date: 2019-07-17 04:45:08
Well the month isn’t over yet and we could fall more
@_date: 2019-07-17 01:11:26
Just stop buying. Nobody is forcing you to fork over money every week to buy more Bitcoin. If you aren’t comfortable increasing your investment, simply just stay put with what you have and enjoy the ride or sell and be done with it. Crypto isn’t worth making your life worse over so don’t let it by over-leveraging yourself.

He just gave large companies giant tax cuts which is obviously going to give a shot of adrenaline to the market. He just wants to pump the stock market so he can get re-elected. That’s why he has been pressuring the fed to lower rates so much when we are at market all time highs.
@_date: 2019-07-12 03:25:33
Yeah because his past 2 years in office have been responsible for the past 10 years of expansion in the US economy. He’s just riding Obama’s coattails and patting himself on the back like it was his accomplishment.

Trump has no grasp of economics considering the way he has been conducting the trade war. Not sure who thought that someone who has gone bankrupt multiple times would be the best suited to call the shots in the largest economy in the world.

Kim Kardashian has 100 million followers on Instagram but she is hardly world-changing. I think the best way to adoption is through use of Bitcoin I’m whichever way anybody seems fit. The more it is used, the more that use will compound as it already has been for the last 10 years.
@_date: 2019-08-31 16:08:18
Bitcoin doesn’t have anything to do with consumption or the use of natural resources. Stop trying to make Bitcoin a cure-all for humanity’s ills because it makes it sound like you are peddling snake oil and that doesn’t help adoption.
@_date: 2019-08-19 19:23:02
You still have to pay taxes when you sell Bitcoin regardless of how much gains you realized. Also there is nothing saying that Bitcoin would or wouldn’t take a beating similar to other assets during a market crash.
@_date: 2019-08-06 18:35:27
Good luck with that. If you think Uncle Sam is just going to let crypto grow without getting his cut, you’re delusional. The less favorable alternative to regulation is an outright ban which would dash all hopes of adoption. The harsh truth is crypto has to work within the framework of regulation because governments will always have more manpower and resources than anybody who wants to see crypto succeed and could easily topple all of the progress made in this space if it has enough willpower to do so.
@_date: 2019-06-22 00:20:23
It’s what I did
@_date: 2019-08-06 20:22:17
That doesn’t even make sense. The vast majority of fiat coming into Bitcoin is coming from the US. If that stream is suddenly cut off, it will make the growth of crypto much harder, not easier. China would likely do the same and there are two of the worlds largest economies in the world that criminalize an asset that relies on new money for price increases. People need to remember that Bitcoin has a lot of room to grow but it could also very well fizzle out and fail altogether. That’s the risk you take when entering this space.

Everyone assuming Bitcoin will benefit from a market crash is ignorant at best. Do you really think people will hold onto their crypto bags when they are struggling to put food on the table? Crypto will be among the first thing people will sell in a true financial crisis.

I have the Ledger Nano S and I haven’t had it for very long but I do like it. I got it off amazon and the device passed the integrity check and I wrote down my own private key so there shouldn’t be any security vulnerabilities. I love it so far and it feels like a pretty durable device and the ledger live UI is nice.
@_date: 2019-06-21 23:48:52
Buying on Amazon is fine if you use your own generated keys and it passes the integrity check
@_date: 2019-06-16 16:08:07
Keeping waiting on that ;)

Ever since I got a hardware wallet I have been a lot less paranoid about losing my crypto. I used to use Coinbase to store all my assets but I’ve heard too many horror stories about accounts being locked to not spend the $50 on a hardware wallet for the peace of mind.
@_date: 2019-06-05 17:11:45
That’s probably the easiest way to lose your crypto

Pretty much another version of discord but more geared towards businesses and such
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:25:25
That seems dependent on how much adoption has progressed when a financial crisis hits. It would be up to the retailers to accept Bitcoin over USD in those conditions.
@_date: 2019-06-01 17:20:57
Buying on Amazon is fine as long as the device passes the integrity check and you use a new seed
