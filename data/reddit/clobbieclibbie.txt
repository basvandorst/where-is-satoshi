Pretty awesome that they weren't able to seize any funds.

I like how he walks right out without thinking twice.

I did this a couple years ago.  I left my wallet at home so my friend paid for my stuff at the store.  I gave him a whole bitcoin to pay him back.  Not long after that,  the price shot up ridiculously and he's been hooked ever since. :p

I got my friends non profit in Florida to start accepting.  She would be stoked to get anything. :p

Here is a nice quick wallet.  The URL is the only way to get your wallet though, so you cant lose that.  :)
If you are just doing a quick hop maybe its right for you. 
Edit: why the downvotes? lol

Maybe the black skins would be more in line with reality.

Thank you very much.

I wish people would stop bashing coinbase.  The fact they are even able to work at all in this ridiculous regulatory environment is amazing enough.   They need to be extra careful not to screw up.  They are a necessary "evil" at this point. 
@_date: 2015-02-21 06:27:22
Yes they should just let everyone do whatever they want.  Lets see how long they last before getting shut down.
