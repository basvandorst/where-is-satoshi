I didn't delete the thread.... I really love relishing those experiences....
@_date: 2014-01-14 04:09:35
I could rebut this from a logical perspective, but instead I won't say anything. Wait 6 months, look at my accomplishments and then have a good laugh when you look back on this comment.

I operate in US &amp; Europe, so I'll need bitpay.
@_date: 2014-01-13 21:50:10
Wow ! Really fantastic answer. Thank you so much for your assistance. As it stands, I'm intending on (presupposing more personal research of course) using BitPay and accepting CryptoCurrency on my business-card service (GranularityCards). If I wanted to keep a small fraction (say, 10%) of the BTC, does BitPay allow me to do so or does it transfer it all into fiat?
@_date: 2014-01-13 21:52:07
Yea, I'm currently under the impression that I'll convert 90% to fiat and keep the rest in BTC.
@_date: 2014-01-14 01:23:47
Are you referring to me or I still think Krugman is kickass, but I also think that quote is hilarious.

Technically, I'm incorporating as an LLC and what he is saying is applicable to if I was a C-Corp or S-Corp, but regardless, I shifted it for added clarity.
@_date: 2014-01-13 21:57:31
Oh, perfect ! I'll get in touch w/ them &amp; Bitpay then.

1) 19 year old adult, thank you very much.
2) For lack of a more eloquent phrase - Haters are going to hate. that's fine. I stay positive in my life and that's all I have control over.
3) It would be one thing if I did it and then said "Hey guys, check out this hasty decision I just made - Woohoo !!!!" I didn't. 
I'm taking the time to ensure I make informed decisions by reaching out to a community of people who spend far more time than I do immersed in cryptocurrency. 
4) You have no idea how my business model functions. Don't pretend otherwise.
5) I'm transferring 90% into fiat money immediately and storing the other 10%. I approached Reddit with thoughts and musings, not concrete plans. Its called brainstorming...

I described this above, but...
My company:
Granularity; This includes GranularityPromo, GranularityCards and GranularityRestaurants. My business 3D prints promotional products (for premier businesses), business cards (for anyone who wants incredible 3D printed business cards) and plate-ware/flat-ware (for high-end restaurants).
@_date: 2014-01-13 21:35:03
We're new. We have various forecasts, but its hard to say with certainty until we have orders from our first chunk of time in operation. 
@_date: 2014-01-13 21:52:46
HAHAHAHA. That quote just earned a spot in my folder called "SUPER Failed Predictions"
@_date: 2014-01-14 01:22:07
I mentioned it in a couple comments, but...

Ah, I see what you're saying. Well, thanks for being so civil and respectful (something many internet communities are devoid of). 
I feel that the construct used to exist with more rigidity in the pre-internet era, but now (especially with the advent of crowd-funding), being a CEO/President/Founder/etc is no longer being a stuffy middle-aged man with a pinstripe suit, a tie bar, slicked back hair and a cigar (what I think of when I think of 1950s CEO). You deserve to celebrate your accomplishments !! At the end of the day, its the small businesses that are really creating jobs (and not the shitty jobs perpetuated by groups like WalMart) so you have no reason not to give yourself 3 Hoorahs ! And to that, I say: Hoorah, Hoorah, Hoorah ! 
@_date: 2014-01-14 04:55:59
haha - I never said you weren't ;). 
@_date: 2014-01-13 21:16:19
That's why I'm 'doing my homework' first. I've not yet accepted any cryptocurrency and I want to ensure I create the best possible solution. Consulting the Reddit community is one of many actions in achieving that.

I'll change it to founder. Good correction.
@_date: 2014-01-13 21:29:08
Certainly. There're two great posts for learning more on Reddit [here]( and [here] (
@_date: 2014-01-13 21:26:06
I'm, as of this very moment, basically a novice in BTC. I've done research, but there's still huge amounts to learn. What's the best market-place for transferring BTC to FIAT?
@_date: 2014-01-13 23:49:31
Regardless of revenue, I founded my company. Therefore, I'm the founder. I'm also functionally the chief executive officer insofar as I'm at the top of the tree that is my corporate structure. Call it president, owner, ceo, etc. At the end of the day, they're conveying the same basic concept. It would be different if I was a C-Corp or S-Corp, but I'm an LLC where corporate structure does not operate under the same stringent formalities.
Age used to matter, I agree. In an era pre-internet where information wasn't so easily accessible, age used to be hugely important because in order to learn, one basically had to work a job that allowed them to observe the process first-hand, but that is no longer the case. As a digital native, my technical time existing may be approx. 19 years, but that bears almost no reflection on my intake of information, which is ultimately what matters in any endeavor, including business.
@_date: 2014-01-13 21:11:45
Yes, I've been working on creating this for about 6 months now, but we're just opening up now. 
Do you know the rules pertaining to merchant service processors &amp; bitcoin? Does this operate totally separately from my MSP? 
@_date: 2014-01-14 04:19:38
I appreciate your perspective. Thanks for sharing. 
@_date: 2014-01-13 22:23:09
The internet is the compilation of functionally all of human knowledge. It was be fundamentally impossible for anyone to ask any question that isn't already somewhere online. 
I'm posting this to access the knowledge-base of a larger community that spends time discussing and pondering the finer details of cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2014-01-14 02:38:27
I never bragged about being a CEO. I put that in the title in a description of the situation I'm in. If you thought it was bragging, that's a matter of you creating comparisons that I have no control over.
As well, our website is completing the pre-launch stages. Like I've mentioned elsewhere in this thread, the website is finishing up a work-in-progress (hence not having photos of our products yet) and the followers &amp; likes represent that work-in-progress. I'm not out marketing my company (which is why I didn't post the name up in the top, but instead within comment threads), but instead I'm seeking information from a group of people knowledgable on the subject. The website is not intended to be a completed project yet (which is why, as you can see, the social media doesn't even have profile photos yet).
@_date: 2014-01-13 21:27:45
Haha, I've been reading Krugman for years. Elaborate?
@_date: 2014-01-14 01:30:16
Thanks !

I don't believe you're the reigning expert, but thanks.

I'm using a super-awesome MSP based in San Francisco (They donate FIFTY percent of their profits to charity!!!). They're called Dharma. 
I'll talk to them about using coinbase or bitpay as well as them. What are your thoughts about coinbase vs. bitpay? 
@_date: 2014-01-14 01:18:24
Fantastic ! Thanks.
@_date: 2014-01-13 21:26:53
Good analysis. Thanks !
