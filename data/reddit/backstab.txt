Does your balance go down when you get the wallet? 
@_date: 2015-06-24 02:33:31
The comic/book store near me accepted bitcoins. It was basically the only place on the coinmap site near me. I went there once to try to buy something with bitcoin, they had the sticker on the window! I get up to the counter to buy something and find out that they no longer accept bitcoin because no one used it and I was the only person to ever ask about it. :(

A few years ago someone posted bitcoin qr code stickers all over my neighborhood with 'btc' written under it, but no one has sent it any.

It's nothing like a check.  When you write a check, your balance hasn't been reduced until it's cashed/cleared.  
@_date: 2014-12-23 20:12:47
Does Brawker cover the cost of changetips too?

I tried day trading a little bit, I've noticed that if I get impatient, I lose money, if I just buy low and sell high, ignoring time, I always go up in value.

When has that ever been the case?
@_date: 2017-11-10 07:19:31
not when 'storing bitcoins' just means you know the private key.

Why do people launder money? because they have dirty money already (albeit from illegal activities, or they don't want to pay taxes on it). So they're already criminals before seeking to launder the money.

You're able to generate a new public address for each transaction if you want, just because it's unused, doesn't mean it's a scam.
