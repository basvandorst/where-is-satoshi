How do you get bitcoins to buy stuff without mining? I wouldn't really want to buy them from someone else. Wouldn't that be considered investing in the currency if I did that?

First off, thanks a lot for all the information you have provided in this thread!
What I was trying to get at in this thread was if my 5770 could do a admirable job starting out at mining bitcoins. The type of "competition" that is created by mining coins was intriguing to me when I was reding about it. I was interested in the hardware aspect of it and not just buying bitcoins from someone else. This competition is what drives me to do folding and the arbitrary points in that project which are awarded to you for completeing a work unit.
It seems like right now from what everyone been talking about in this thread, the market for bitcoins and mining for them is not worth the cost it would take to make a dedicated mining rig right now and that was what I was interested in, because I love projects/software like this that makes my PC work to its fullest potential.

The GPU clients for folding proteins are still mostly experimental. Nvidia cards are more efficient folding while ATi don't fold as well. A powerful Nvidia card will net you around 18k points per day while a top of the line ATi will get you around 8k-9k per day.
If you are in it to get serious points you fold on your CPU, which has to be something like a 2600k if you want BIG points. To put it in perspective the average workunit for a GPU would award you around 1,000 points and around 3 hrs to finish while a advance workunit on the CPU called bigadv would award you 60k points and take you around 2 days to complete.

I had this in mind when the replies started coming in ;) I thought it was very strange everyone was discouraging me to start mining for coins.  
I was actually throwing around the idea of buying a 68xx or 69xx GPU to throw in an extra computer laying around to maybe get started mining because I read that the client basically just uses the GPU power, you can get by with a single core Sempron as a cpu, that's unheard of in the folding protein world!

That's what I don't understand. I started this thread to see how much BTC my 5770 could make running 24/7. It seems like if you want to get into Bitcoins you have to make a $2000-$3000 supermachine with 4 GPUs.  How will Bitcoins ever take off if newbies like me who want to get their feet wet have to invest that much money just to start mining then risk a month later of mining not becoming profitable?
I don't just want to go and buy bitcoins on the market, that's too easy IMO.  I am one who likes to help out the cause. But if that means me putting down thousands on a machine that MIGHT break me into the community it doesn't seem worth for people looking into doing it. Am I wrong in my thinking?

So how exactly do you break into the bitcoin community then? Both the comments on here suggest not building a rig. In order to break in to bitcoin mining does one have to build a super machine costing a small fortune?
