It may hurt bitcoin in the short term but not pain no gain. You have to get rid of the problem.

I have been here 2012. Reading all this bullshit about rogue miners, if people cant vote with their computers what do they vote with. All your highhorse bullshit made me fire up a BU node, so there you go. Someone who was sitting on the fence has now fired up a BU node. I'm sure many others will do the same. Screw blockstream.

Strange, there doesn't seem to be any other subreddits that have this problem. It's a shame you have to try and control people opinions, it makes your subreddit boring. up votes and down votes are a feature of reddit. have you tried moving it back to Facebook? I heard they have great censorship controls.
@_date: 2017-01-21 15:14:26
No, actually I misunderstood how the temporary hidden score works. its temporary as in after a set amount of time you can see the upvotes, I understand that now What I was originally lead to believe is that you had removed all scores temporarily and that you were going to re-enable them in the future. 
So my apologies as I misunderstood the system you were using, now I understand how it works I don't think its that bad of an idea.

I'm in the same category as you, there are some jobs as project managers on the tech side but finance wise there isn't too many availabilities. I've started several of my own companies teaching locals and offering technical guidance in my spare time, I'd advise you to do the same thing, whatever it is you think would provide value
If you really do want a job in the industry though keep checking the jobs sites and search keywords bitcoin and blockchain, you may find something.

Those are the 3 charactistics every blockchain should be aiming for. The first blockchain to hit those 3 charactistics while remaining decentralised will play a key part in the decentralised future and I would say bitcoin is much more political than "othercoin" with politics everything takes longer e.g. taking 3 years to scale. "Othercoin" seems to be moving very quickly with development. "Othercoin" seems to have a lot more attack vectors than bitcoin which seem to have been overlooked by the dev team but on the other side they also seem to be learning and improving it with every alteration so if bitcoin doesn't come together as a community "othercoin" could keep growing and improving and overtake bitcoin. Both its corporate and private userbase is growing continuously we all know that. I follow both Bitcoin and btc and personally I believe bitcoin needs to hurry up with a compromise or it could lose a majority of its users if it activates segwit. Many businesses have already pivoted to provide both bitcoin and "othercoin" if segwit activates those companies against it may very well change their business again model as retaliation.

If it's only censorship that's causing the problem why don't you just stop censoring. Seems pretty black and white to me.
@_date: 2016-12-18 06:50:43
No as ethereum gets the first mover advance on smart contracts + RSK seem to have a fairly greedy business model
@_date: 2016-11-17 20:10:33
It's not just Roger though. It's a fairly large group of users and businesses within the ecosystem which have not only voiced their opinion but taken action by pivoting from bitcoin to bitcoin AND ethereum. 
With regards to creating another coin you are correct. Another coin should of been created a long time ago with higher block limits and acted as a test for scaling. If it encountered problems then it would be clear that that was not the correct route to take. 
@_date: 2016-11-03 07:26:19
See I got into the ethereum presale, and brought more at 60 cents, my missed opportunity was not cashing back into bitcoin after that initial bubble before any of the attacks/hacks.
@_date: 2016-11-17 07:22:54
And it's not populism it's called problem, solution, response. One thing bitcoin has taught me these past 2 years is that as long as people have their investments and self interests at heart the world will never change. I've noticed how those who are more invested especially towards china seem to see other projects as threats and are opposed to supporting them. Even when it helps learn more about the technology or improve the technology.  Its funny because the more you look at the guys heavily invested in asics and china the more they look like the monsters that pushed us away from the traditional system in the first place. 
@_date: 2016-12-10 11:14:59
They aren't investing in currencies they are investing in ethereum based tokens by the looks of it.
@_date: 2016-12-09 16:28:10
So then use it as a buying sevice and then move the coins to a safer storage, this is a useful IMO 
@_date: 2016-12-10 11:13:27
No when he was refering to tokens they were definitely talking about ethereum based tokens/digital assetss
@_date: 2016-11-16 11:12:25
Wow that's expensive for a transaction.
@_date: 2016-12-08 01:11:42
I've actually had nothing but good experiences so far but if they have a reputation I'll definitely be trying some other exchanges/services now.
@_date: 2016-12-16 01:17:12
Who are the only people who benefit from full blocks? Miners. Someone is obviously spamming the network so that people pay higher fees to move their money so they can clean up more transaction fees

Ethereum has no economic activity but santander are testing and exhibiting a EUR backed ethereum token which would be accessible from your normal santander account. There are more projects working with ethereum everyday. Charlie Shrem is working on an ethereum project. It seems the reason why you try and mock ethereum developers is because you may be scared. If bitcoin is so well developed then spare some of your time to help review some ethereum code. No one gains anything from fighting but working together will help everyone.
This isn't bitcoin vs ethereum it's cryptocurrency trying to save the world.

Segwit is controversial for one reason and one reason only. Users don't want blockstream having anything to do with the bitcoin protocol, that's all it comes down to. If segwit was proposed by original core developers it would of been accepted. Fact of the matter is people despise blockstream.

Most likely the same that happened when ether hard forked.  The morally correct chain will win the majority market share and the other chain will slowly fail or be used else where.

Buying into crowdsales of projects I believe in then cashing out down the line, average wait is about 6 months average payout is about 1000% can only see it increasing as more ethereum ICO's pop up. Waiting to get back into bitcoin properly and long term but untill it scales and while there is still risk of a hard fork it's not for me although it has performed well this past year.
