Agreed, but I might substitute the word Bitcoin for Blockchain.

This is YUGE!!!

Keep the cool guys, we've come too far to rage quit now. 
I wouldn't put too much value into the sentiment on here, there is some really solid analysis coming out of Concensus this past week, especially from the likes of Carter Thomas and Chris Dunn on the long term outlook. If your not a day trader forget about the micro movements and focus on the long term

Not in my experience here in the UK. My GBP is currently on hold for 5 days since my Bank Transfer on Coinbase before I can even transfer it to Coinbase Pro. I refuse to pay Coinbase's silly fees.

I can easily see a dump happening in May before a rise. 
Ive noticed Bitcoin's moves are getting more and more contraian lately, shaking out weak hands etc. If everyone is betting on a price rise/fall at a given time Bitcoin has a habit of doing the opposite, at least initially.

I very much like the idea of BTC acting as a non corliated asset in a global recession, the logic is clear to everyone who is engaged in the Crypto space. 
BUT the reality is Bitcoin has never been tested in such an environment so it remains a hypothesis. How/if a flight from traditional assets into BTC during the next recession happens is very hard to predict, especially among more seasoned fund managers who traditionally resort to Gold as their hedge of choice. 
Crypto/Bitcoin for me is more than just digital gold as the early internet evolved into more than just a repository for information.

What is your lower trend line based on? . . . we Blew past the lower support line of the descending wedge Hard on Sunday.
I personally do not see a shortterm Bullish sentiment, mid to Long term is the real question. I'm reducing my stake and going to see how it pans out.

10k is a really great price milestone as usually with a clear overhead resistance people try and beat the crowds and sell before it is reached. But with 10k everyone wants to wait for it to hit that juicy round number before selling. 
Now what the pull back (if any!!!) will look like once we hit 10k is going to be way harder to call.
@_date: 2019-08-29 22:50:59
10k never has been strong support really . . .

First thing I thought reading this JPMorgan headline was r/bitcoin is going to have a field day with this . . . . and I was not disappointed!  Love you all and your antiestablishment trolling very much.

Bitcoin Ticker Widget is good for keeping an eye on price and setting price alerts on Android I find.  Maybe not the sharpest of tools though, tradingview.com is hard to beat if your after proper charting tools. 
 is great for having open in your browser as it shows just the USD price in the tab header.

Discussion: Was 2017 peak Crypto?
@_date: 2018-11-07 14:59:49
What money?
@_date: 2018-03-18 14:42:00
I think the outcome of the G20 discussion is going to have a big bearing on price. A positive outcome should hopefully be the spark we need to kick us up out of this 4 figure slump. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:13:42
He still should have sold it via an OTC channel instead of all in one go on the open market Tanking the price. Amateur!
@_date: 2018-03-11 19:17:18
Just when you think you are starting to notice a pattern Bitcoin goes and jumps 1000pts on a Sunday.
@_date: 2018-03-19 10:51:04
Does anyone know around what time (GMT) we'll start to hear word on the outcome of the G20 summit's discussions on Crypto?
@_date: 2018-02-18 09:21:09
Nothing more than our usual weekend dip folks, it was inevitable after that big run this past week. Sit tight, have faith and hodl! Even if it's late Monday/Tuesday before we set to work breaking that magic 11.5k resistance line.

Wise words, number 5 is some solid advice and often left unmentioned. That's how gambling addictions start, spending all you time obsessing over price. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 11:25:20
Yes! Let's get out of this sub 10k funk! Stick it to the man!!!
@_date: 2018-02-20 08:07:09
lol Bitcoin was initially designed to do just this . . . awkward! ��
@_date: 2018-11-05 09:05:30
Lovely the Cyberpunk (Cryptopunk) vibes!
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:26:26
A little bit if sideways action right now is no harm, building that base.
@_date: 2018-03-22 12:21:33
There absolutly is. However, in the inevitable event of a financial crash how could you stimulate the economy if you can't inject money into it (ie. Quantitative easing)?
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:24:48
Can somebody please introduce this Muppet to an OTC platform where he can offload the rest of these Bitcoin without Tanking the entire crypto space again by selling on the open market!
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:42:40
Too right, FIAT is no longer backed by gold so it's not all that different. Just look at how Central Banks use quantitative easing during a downturn.  
@_date: 2018-04-21 11:37:09
Too right! It was bound to correct after that clear break through the downtrend line. The question is will it bounced back up off it and by how much?
@_date: 2018-04-26 21:02:19
We're back in Business!

Feeling that same FOMO brother.

Bang on the Money, this is crazy. Only thing I can think of is US equities piling in due to new US-China trade wars. But who really knows?
@_date: 2019-05-29 12:32:20
Spot on Mike.
Bitcoin will always be Bitcoin but the quantity and origin of money buying in this time will be substantial different from the 2015 run.
@_date: 2018-12-11 19:00:49
Genuine adoption (and use) would see prices soar to the point where 2017 would look like a drop in the ocean. Whether that will be BTC or something else is the bigger question.
