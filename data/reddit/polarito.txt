Monero already has higher fees at the moment (measured in XMR and BTC, respectively - measured in USD Bitcoin's fees are higher of course but only x2, while price is x40; and we would expect Monero's price to be higher than Bitcoin's price if there was "flippening" in usage).
I didn't know Monero's fees would become lower with more usage. How does this work?
@_date: 2018-01-10 09:00:46
But if a coin like BCH wins over BTC because of perception in the news instead of facts then the entire crypto ecosystem is in deep trouble.
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:43:43


Larger block sizes make running a node more expensive (primarily because of bandwidth used).
@_date: 2018-01-21 17:48:36
No, a wallet like a ledger does not add security to the network and does have a "vote" during protocol changes.
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:17:25
I don't, but I'd be interested in that information as well.
@_date: 2018-01-29 11:02:46
It's absolutely wrong. SegWit did not cause a hard fork at all. BCH hard forked several weeks before SegWit even activated.
@_date: 2018-01-10 09:04:28
Oh boy. He confuses exchange fees with mining fees.
@_date: 2018-01-05 01:01:25
The last paragraph is also the part where you are wrong the most. Websites and applications virtually never store passwords unhashed, they do *not* have direct access to your passwords, nor do they need to.
@_date: 2018-01-13 15:56:41
How does dynamic blocksize make fees *lower* with higher usage? You could make the argument that they would not rise much, but this does not work infinitely, and itroduces other problems.
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:02:37
But that's not a *fix*, it's just a delay. And it's dangerous because it could lead to more centralization. The main point of Bitcoin (and cryptocurrencies in general) is decentralization, and the resulting control and security you have over your wealth.
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:56:51
Two points:
1. bulletproof is scheduled to come out in March, but in could be delayed. Bitcoin, of course, has LN coming at some point as well. Also please note, bulletproof was also developed by Bitcoin Core devs.
2. Monero's fees are currently *about* 20 times as large as Bitcoin's (measured in XMR and BTC, respectively), and this is with *no* congestion! A reduction of 80% still results in fees 4 times as high. Now of course, this is dependent on a lot of factors and might not be true in the end. My point is simply that Monero does note have an advantage over Bitcoin in terms of fees, if I'm not mistaken.
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:40:49
Monero's transactions are significantly larger than Bitcoin's, so the Monero network is likely to be congested faster than Bitcoin's, resulting in even higher fees. EDIT: typos.
EDIT2: Please note, Monero already has higher fees at the moment (measured in XMR and BTC, respectively - measured in USD Bitcoin's fees are higher of course but only x2, while price is x40; and we would expect Monero's price to be higher than Bitcoin's price if there was "flippening" in usage).

I assume you're in the US? Then I've heard Gemini is another option. I'm in Europe, and bitstamp is pretty solid around here.
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:05:41
It's network effect, scarcity, security, decentralization (control over your wealth) and the fact that some of the best devs are working on it. All these things depend on each other - security for example is higher when the price is higher, because there's more mining. It's not easy for another project to overtake Bitcoin, especially since Bitcoin's problem (congestion) cannot be fixed easily without giving up some of the main points.
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:36:12
Seconded. Not just animals, but nature conservation (correct expression in english?) in general is what I would support as well.
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:09:05
It's not true, Ver was never part of Core. Bitcoin Core is the name of the software client and all the developers who have contributed to it. Ver is not a dev, he's never written any code.
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:43:09
Yes, but by that logic nobody is ever really selfless, and the expressesion loses its substance. Probably most actions are done out of ultimately self interested motives, be it happiness about somebody elses happines, satisfying the urge to save your child, making more money, having fun playing basketball, etc.
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:25:23
Nobody can suddenly destroy 10'000 bitcoin. The block reward is currently 12.5 bitcoin, and it will only get smaller. One could send 10'000 bitcoin to a random address, yeah, but it would not cause panic, it would just seem weird.
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:37:55
No way. He'd make up some stupid excuse and keep going.
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:38:58
Example? I haven't seen a working scaling solution yet. Yes, there are lots of cheap coins. But none of them get used like bitcoin does. And the ones that offer scaling up to bitcoins usage are much more likely to be centralized.
Technology providing censorship resistance, trustlessness, security, decentralization and millions of transactions a day needs a lot of time and a lot of work. We're talking about a blockchain worth over $200 billion here, not some cheap altcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:41:08
That, and because they have bigger blocks which leads to centralization. Remember: Decentralization is the basic idea of cryptocurrencies. BCH has hardly any developers working on it, it seems, and has already experienced some serious bugs. It's not really a contender to BTC at the moment.
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:01:10


Why not?
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:04:55
Yes. They can give you a BTC address you can send bitcoin. They probably find this under 'deposit' and then bitcoin. Make sure there's no deposit limit on gdax before you send an amount that's bigger.
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:39:17
I think OP means: Sell BTC --&gt; Buy XMR. So in the XMR market it's a buy wall.
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:15:43
Care to elaborate? I fail to see how devs aren't responding to it in a timely manner. We're talking about a $200+ bilion market cap blockchain here. Not some alt of 10% of its size, with almost no usage, only a few developers, weak consensus rules, where you simply hard fork to scale a little bit.
What do you suggest? Block size increase? That's just a bandaid, and it endangers decentralization. SegWit adoption? Not up to the devs. LN should be happening faster? lul.

You're not wrong. It's just not very easy. Some people doing bitcoin politics are insanely rich, and have a huge following. People are obivously tricked by bitcoin.com and I appreciate learning this from you. By replying to your posts I was trying to clear this up to you, and to others who might read this. Lots of people try to help like this and it's generally working out - look at the prices of BTC and BCH.


You're also absolutely right about this.

@_date: 2017-11-27 15:12:07


I agree with your other points mostly but you're making it too easy for yourself here. Some people are offended by things you and me can't possibly be. We've never experienced it. It's not always as easy as to choose to ignore it, I assume. Don't get me wrong I'm so well off I'm hardly ever offended by anything, I just try to be compassionate.
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:21:26
I actually detected the sarcasm. But have an upvote cause I think your comment is funny!
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:49:07
There's lots of memes centered around sex, OP being one example. What I meant is that as a woman she is obivously affected by those jokes in a way we are not. So when we ask the question: Why are there so few women in this? She can contribute to the answer from her experience.
That said, I can't name 2 women that stay up watching youtube videos on c# and bitcoin white papers (I know 1). So I think the whole issue goes deeper than sexism in a bitcoin subreddit.

I was honestly struggling to understand the sentence but I think I get it now. It might not even be totally off but obviously there's some ground between telling your wife about your wealth and "giving her everything and all power".
Anyways, which sub was that?
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:41:26


Exactly, and now ask yourself why.
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:29:24
You could argue that:
- BTC has SegWit which increases onchain capacity, reduces fees, fixes the malleability bug, fixes the quadratic hashing bug and makes second layer solutions for likely.
- BTC does not have 8mb blocks, therefore running a node is easier and the network is more likely to be decentralized.
- BTC has more developers working on it, and more prominent ones as well.
- BTC is much more widely adopted, has a longer history including multiple attacks it survived and a much larger community.
- There are controversies surrounding this forum and Bitcoin Core developers. However, it seems like Bitcoin Cash development and marketing is driven by only a handful of people whose interests are very suspect, and backed by a forum full of personal attacks and conspiracy theories.
EDIT1: 
- BTC has much more hash power securing the network.
Just to be clear, Bitcoin Cash's larger blocks immediately increase onchain capacity. But you could argue that this is only a band-aid and not a longterm scaling solution, unlike for example BTC's possible second layer technology. I believe BTC will eventually have to increase the blocksize limit as well and it is on the roadmap of Core developers.

Ok now I'm genuinly wondering: Did you really think bitcoin.com was something official and therefore BCH is the real bitcoin? That's just a private domain owned by Roger Ver who is pushing for his version of the blockchain. Bitcoin, unlike some other cryptocoins, is not owned, run or led by certain individuals or a company.
The code for the most widely used client (Bitcoin Core) is open source and anybody can suggest changes - if they reach consensus they will basically be implemented, and if nodes and miners agree, they will install these new versions.
bitcoin.org is not an official bitcoin website either, but it comes closer because it is managed by people who are closely associated by developers who have contributed a lot to the Bitcoin Core project.

I know this. But it's still so unlikely that it's safe to call it impossible. People are not suddenly going to stop selling bitcoin. I know that I'm going to sell more of my holdings if it hits $15k again, and more at $20k. That's exactly what this topic is about: Yes, there are h0dlers who are into bitcoin because they believe it will take over the world and who will never sell. But the majority of bitcoin owners will sell at least some of their coins for the right price, in order to take profits. And it's the former who are dominating this sub.
@_date: 2018-03-12 01:34:13
Some comments in here prove you right. But, it's quite natural for most communities to take themselves too seriously and think of themselves as more important than they are. I live in Switzerland and it's refreshing how well appreciated cryptocurrencies and blockchain projects are by the authorities. 
I'm still deeply invested in BTC but I agree with OP and think most paranoia and most price predicitons (1 mil? seriously?) in this sub are way overblown.
@_date: 2018-03-04 20:55:13
No? Keynesianism is about aggregate demand being the major factor of economic output (vs. supply). It promotes government spending during recessions. It's about *fiscal* policy, not *monetary* policy like printing money (which is usually done by central banks and not the government itself). 
@_date: 2018-03-04 19:56:24

Nah. But I definitely would have laughed at you if you told me it would be over $5k by the end of 2017. I was wrong, but I still think $1mil is impossible. It would require a total financial collapse.
@_date: 2018-03-04 20:30:03
And the other 95% are supposed to work which jobs exactly? See, the point is machines are probably doing most of the work one day. I don't know what the solution is, but a basic income is one idea. Obviously the 5% who do work get way more than the basic income, so it's not work for free. Also, look at European countries like Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland, etc. and you will see welfare societies are sometimes doing better economocally than the US.
@_date: 2018-03-04 20:17:15
But why would everybody have to work and produce waste when technology is able to provide everything neccessary for everybody on its own (andaybe the work of 5% of the population)? That's the hypothetical scenario behind the idea of a basic income.
