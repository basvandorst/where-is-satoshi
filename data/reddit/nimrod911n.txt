Last decade? You mean since 2008?

And sth else I want to add. Right now my savings are split 1/3 each in fiat, crypto and precious metals. Now I can have almost 2/3 in crypto and still maintain the same level of comfort in everyday life. I want to pay my daily stuff using my btc wallet. But I simply cant. Adoption takes time. BTC is gaining ground but it is not there yet.

Well, I support a payment system that supports btc and crypto. I dont mind the fee. If I can pay with my wallet then I do. If not I can use this visa card from Bitwalla. Is better in my opinion. 
What iam worried about is taxing capital gains each time I pay with btc.... Iam not quite clear on that matter...

Not only sample size. Group of age, on what site was the poll. User preference etc. Go to a retirement home starting a poll about pension raise. 100% there vote for it. Go to financial university and 100% are against it. 
Polls dont tell me anything, if I dont know how it is made up.

Ok ok, I get it. I'am on your side, dont forget that. The thing is Bitcoin is not usable yet for most of the people except some small occassions. I cant buy stuff in Bitcoin in Real Life. I live in a shittown. 
So i do it like this. Whatever helps bitcoin for now, i do it. And guess what, you can use it as a ordinary wallett.
You are right, it is not a anonymous wallet, it still supports the banking system, and you are still like glass and the government can watch it all.
But it also gives exposure, and it has real world implications and helps people. Because peoplewant to send money to other people. But right now bitcoin is not just for anyone. Ask how many people use it for daily live. I bet it is 1% of the community

No annual fee either for Bitwala
@_date: 2019-08-25 15:29:39
You forgot Bitwala.com (MasterCard issued)
@_date: 2017-11-04 19:46:04
I suggest Kraken too. Bank transfer is very quick and they are trustworthy atm. Never had trouble with them except the plattform being unresponsive on big events flooding the market with orders.
bitwalla.com which is now in the process of becoming a full fledged crypto bank. It is a german company and in that regard it is unlikely that they fuck with your money. And I like the idea of having most of my fiat in btc and pay with it everywhere. Of coz never put everything in one basket
After those you can send your btc onto other exchanges like bittrex, binance etc. and buy your desired coins or ICO's.

Wouldn't that mean long term the fees gonna stabilize/ reach equilibrium in terms of high/low transaction volume?

Even though i never really had any trouble with deposits and withdrawals, Kraken can be slow in times when it needs to be fast.
On the last marketcorrection i tried to sell my btc into cash, it dipped further and further. But my trade didnt go through. Lost a couple hundred bucks because of delayed trade.
As a addition kraken no longer has advanced order mechanisms like stop-loss/take profit. They say it causes problems and that they will be back in 2 months.
Even with coinigy i had trouble getting my orders online on Kraken and that is through API.
Poloniex and all the other exchanges i tried are much faster. I need to be able to sell and buy when the market is in turmoil. For that regard I now use others means.

Waoh, your first post with the tinfoil is complete opposite from this one :). Thank you very much for going so lengthy in response as i now understand your point much better. Great post

Of course you are right. We wouldnt have come so far without banks and exchanges. Never said that though. There is also no evidence for my thesis/idea. 
Would you agree with me that the exchanges in their current condition are the biggest attack vector on crypto in general?
I also think that daytrading should be limited to a maximum amount of trades per day
@_date: 2018-02-27 06:00:41
Split your private key and hand it to your family members. Tell them that unless you pick it up in person sth is wrong. 
Dont forget. If you can get it, they can. So to prevent that, you yourself must be unable to get it. Timelock maybe?
In the end you will still get a beating no matter how safe your bitcoins are.

Do exchanges have the properties of an bank and what did banks do in the past? If something looks like an car and drives like a car then it is a car.
Of course we dont know shit. Thats the thing. Trustless system and having to trust exchanges to not fuck us. You see the hypocracy?
Exchanges have all the properties of a bank. And banks are what for bitcoin? 
I dont mean to discredit them all. Just my thoughts and you are entitled to your opinion. The coming months are gonna be a rollercoaster of FUD and news.

See goldman sachs betting against their own clients in the housing bubble.
For me, a exchange is nothing else then a bank. You dont hold your funds, they do. Not only are you risking to loose it all by hacking or fraud, but by countertrading the market. It is like playing poker against a opponent who can see your cards and is the dealer at the same time. Imagine a exchange-run or shutdown with no means of withdrawal of crypto and cash.
If they dont want you to sell or buy "sorry, we have some technical issues, we will be back up in a couple of hours/days".
BTC and crypto is about decentralization, and it is our job as non-miners to fight centralization by taking our funds of exchanges.
Call me tinfoil had as much as you want. No argument on your side makes it actually useless to response.

Nexus(NXS) does that already. PoW for CPU and GPU and PoS. Those 3 change in a random matter for finding blocks. For 51%-attacks you would need to have all 3 under control

Two things Satoshi could not forecast:
* ASIC miners, with it the centralisation
* Extremely fast growth of bitcoin usage and exposure 
* Fullnodes becoming less attractive
Your 2X with no replay protection is utter bullshit. It leads to bloated blockchainsize, further centralization and less full nodes. 
Bitcoin can only grow and be more successful with decntralization. When we have to trust miners and when there are only huge nodes that we as normal people cant operate due to high cost it is game over.
Remember the big thing about Bitcoin is THRUSTLESS BLOCKCHAIN.
The solution is 2nd layer technology, miners dont like it though.

Maybe have more then one wallet? One for everyday purchases that you can give them. One for savings. And never talk to anyone how much you have... Not driving a lambo can help too.

Ok, thank you very much for this info. I'am german, some things are hard for me to grasp in english and I got this information from a youtube video. I could have misunderstood things there. 
I was reading from multiple sources just now about Segwit and 2x and you helped me alot. But I'am more confused right now. Time for a beer :).
@_date: 2017-07-29 19:53:11
Sorry for the misunderstanding. What i meant was this:
Segwit2x means segwit in combination with double blocksize, right?
Is a segwit2x blockchain still compatible via lightning to a ordinary segwit blockchain. Is atomic swapping still possible?
@_date: 2017-07-29 21:47:31
From my understanding SegWit does not double the filesize. The witness part in a block is taken out = ergo the name segregated witness. Without the witness part in the block we can store roughly double the transactions in a block without increasing blocksize. So with Segwit we still have 1MB blocksize, or am I of?
Segwit2x is Segwit in combination with a increase to 2MB blocksize, right?
