The correct answer is to agitate for better regulation for banks which requires them to cancel all kinds of recurring payments on request (as happened in the UK and the rest of the EU with the Payment Services Directive) rather than just completely removing recurring payments. That's baby-out-with-bathwater level stuff.

Neither the dollar nor Bitcoin are ponzis. Dollars are not a Ponzi because your earning a profit from them is not solely derived from those "buying in" to dollars. Bitcoin is not a Ponzi because there is no profit to earn on them that isn't capital gains - if your only means of making money is to cash out then it's not a Ponzi by definition.

But reputation is everything. You bring up KPMG for a reason; they are well known, reputable auditors with a reasonable guarantee of thoroughness and objectivity. People and businesses *trust* KPMG because they are known to do a good job.
Firestartr.co do not have that. They aren't even a fucking auditors' or accountancy firm, they are a *venture capital company*. Aside from that quite possibly having implications of conflict of interest in them auditing a startup, nobody knows who these guys are and what their qualifications are.

There's a term for this. "BSABSVR". "Both Sides Are Bad So Vote Republican". It's nonsense, because it ignores the fundamental nature of the Republican party.
The Democratic party, from the perspective of a complete outsider to the US political system (albeit one who follows it rather closely, mostly out of horrified fascination), are at least sane and have an inkling of wanting to make things better for average people while also being willing to make reasonable compromises to this end goal. The Republicans, meanwhile, are comprised of a collection of insane, theocratic bigots who intend to solve every economic problem they can think of with tax cuts and spending cuts despite all rational evidence that doing so is a bad idea (while not actually following through on the spending cuts bit when in office), and who will brook no argument about any of their conservative dogma and make no compromises, to the point where they attempted to make the USA default on its debt in order to force their own policies into law (and try to force the repeal of the Democrats' policies) despite not having any kind of democratic mandate. They have swung so hard and fast to the right that even senior members of the Bush administration such as Colin Powell and David Frum have publicly criticised them.
They are a LONG way from the party of Lincoln that ended slavery, they have been since the implementation of the Southern Strategy in the 70s and to claim "but Lincoln was a Republican" in this day and age is simply bullshit on an absurd level. If you guys want to choose one of their representatives as your legislative hero because he happens to like Bitcoin, have at it, but all I'll say is be careful who you end up with as a bedfellow.

Right. You have no clue what you're talking about.
Those are *reserves*. They are funds held by banks in reserve (hence the name), and exactly what TARP and QE were intended to create - capitalisation for banks to ensure their stability and encourage lending in the constricted credit market. That's the *intended effect of the fucking policies*. Not some unintended outcome.
Also note that there's a big uptick on 2008. This is not just for TARP and QE; this is also Basel II's capitalisation requirements coming into effect, mandating that banks hold bigger reserves.

And the laundering of money is a specific accessory to that crime that stems specifically from that crime. Note that if you are laundering your own clean money then there has been no offence committed - "money laundering", as a term, applies specifically to obscuring the source of the proceeds of *criminal activities*, so I would be very interested in your idea of "legitimate" reasons to employ it that are not to get around shortfalls in the Bitcoin concept.
Moreover, money laundering *does* hurt people by making such crimes which *could not* have been "caught" non-obvious, and the proceeds of those crimes easily used and therefore making the crimes themselves profitable. If the money cannot be laundered then you are unable to benefit from the crime without arousing detection, thus deterring the crime itself. Money laundering laws and controls are and have been used to detect many, many crimes which the justice system would otherwise be unable to detect.


Because of that pesky "social contract" thing. Not to mention, AML regulations and suspicious activity reports *are* "them" (whoever "they" are in this context) "catching criminals committing actual crimes".


I would rather have the "semblance" of privacy that the current system offers than the complete non-privacy (or more privacy so long as I can contrive things by using tumblers and such) of having a public transactional ledger.

Honestly, I'm not personally sure myself, since I'm not American (and therefore not fully up on my US economic history) and it's not something I've specifically looked into like the other stuff. My *understanding*, from a quick look around these here Internets, is that the US government bought and sold gold stocks to foreign countries as per its own needs, meaning that the amount of gold held by the US government and therefore backing the currency wasn't constant (and, of course, gold can be and is dug out of the ground) and the value of it also was not constant.

If you want to argue that people who are critical of Bitcoin are shills without any sort of proof, you are talking bollocks. If you are doing so to try and discredit them, you are handwaving. If you have Bitcoin holdings and you want people to stop talking it down, despite you having a direct financial interest in it being talked up, that would effectively make you a shill and therefore a hypocrite. Please explain how I'm wrong on any of this?
I note that you haven't actually responded to anything I said on that front. Probably because you'd then have to admit you really do have no evidence whatsoever of any "shills", or that Darkwings was one, and that you were just making it up.
Incidentally, yes you are flouncing. I asked you a question politely in good faith and you went off on one about how I'm ignorant because I didn't personally read any racist posts from Darkwings. If you provide proof - Internet Archive, quoted posts, whatever - I will quite gladly call Darkwings a racist, anti-semitic fuckhole and give a full apology for defending him. But since you're intent on calling him a shill based on nothing, I'll kind of need more proof than just your say-so, considering that again this is something I didn't personally see. Deal?

Not especially. Windows runs on &gt;90% of the PCs in the world. That's a huge target market for a malware author. Even if it were the hardest platform to code an exploit for ever (and it isn't) it would be more profitable to write malware for it simply because it's in the widest usage and therefore there's more chance of it being successful.
Compare this to Linux, where the userbase is not only tiny but also tends to be more technical than average and therefore less interested in running random Java applets or funny_miley_cyrus_screensaver.exe, or Mac, where the userbase is still remarkably small.

Yes but computers can be used for things other than crime, as can the Internet, saws, debatably guns and most other tools. Bitcoin is almost uniquely brilliant for criminals as it gives them the one thing they were missing - a pseudo-anonymous financial system that isn't trying to keep them out and in fact isn't able to, and moreover through things like exchanges of cash for Bitcoin assists in laundering normal money too.
One can agree that otherwise useful tools can be misused for criminal purposes while also saying that some tools are vastly more useful to criminals due to their nature than others.

Could we please stop with this bollocks? The idea that anyone who posts in a negative way about Bitcoin is paid to do so is paranoid rubbish of the worst sort. At the very least, and ignoring the delusions of grandeur someone would have to have to think large companies actually care about making posts on a poxy subreddit, I would expect that someone who is paid to post here wouldn't be as inflammatory with it as Darkwings is (yeah, let's pay someone to call the people we want onside cocks...)
At the very least, it is toxic to discourse; it's an excuse for people to handwave away legitimate comments as being from "paid shills" so they can be ignored. It's also grossly hypocritical, since holders of Bitcoin often proselytise and encourage others to buy Bitcoin without mentioning that their holdings will go up in value if they do.
Please... Stop it.

Regardless of the size or whatever, it still pushes off all of the risk of the transaction onto the merchant. Try telling a business "OK someone *could* come in and scam free stuff out of you and you don't know if they will until they've already done it but it's fine because it's quicker" and they'll laugh you out of the building.
Compare this to, say, NFC card payments, which are even quicker than Bitcoin and don't have the no-confirmation risk, and it's not surprising that Bitcoin just isn't being accepted for in-store purchases.
Also, I don't even know of any cafes or restaurants that accept cheques any more. They've damn near died out totally. Before, yes, the merchant carried the risk of them bouncing; that's why, by and large, they don't take them any more.

What you just put there is not especially controversial or in any way wrong. In fact it's a very dry description of what central banks in general do and the effect their activities have. What's your point?


I refuse to watch any video whose title starts with "The Biggest Scam..." (which incidentally I have been linked to multiple times, and seems to be used a lot by Austrian school adherents to try to get people on-side). If you have anything coherent to say you won't use screamy titles like that. If you can actually coherently structure your argument, write it down and don't just put it in scary sounding YouTube videos.


Ahem... the excess reserves that banks have been **required** to keep on the books in order to stave off bank runs as part of international agreements such as Basel II and also regulatory action by the Federal Reserve itself.


No, hyperinflation is by definition a hyper-increase in the rate of **inflation**, which can be because of a hyper-increase in the supply of currency but can also be for a number of other reasons. The clue is in the word "hyperinflation". While saying it means "printing currency" might agree with your ideological viewpoint, that is not what dictionaries say it means:




It is a red herring anyway, since quite clearly QE or money printing has not let to "hyperinflation" by any sensible definition of the term (e.g. the Weimar Republic, [where the government literally printed enough money to pay off their reparations from WW1 and completely fucked their economy in the process]( - which, before you say it, is in no way comparable to QE in either scale or effect). The rate of inflation is at present hovering around 2%, and on most recent data is at 1.25%. That is not hyperinflation. Historically, it is a very low inflation rate indeed. Trying to argue otherwise is arguing against reality.


Entirely true. What's your point? That wouldn't mean the Fed (or central banks in general) are terrible or should be abolished. It would mean regulatory steps should be taken to avoid such a thing happening again, which are being taken.


So basically, anything bad is the fault of the Federal Reserve. Roger. So, given that the US economy is getting *better*, with [sustained economic growth]( and a [inflation rate around 1.25%]( they should get some credit right?


What you've just done there is basically say "you know all those things I've made sound really bad? If you agree they sound really bad, why not use Bitcoin!" without actually establishing that those things are bad at all.

Bitcoin is absolutely off the charts on any competent money laundering and financial crime risk scale. Higher risk necessitates a higher standard of due diligence according to regulators around the world.

Weird, because over here in the EU and the UK in particular, regulations (specifically the Payment Services Directive) have spearheaded many different advances in payments, such as near-instant payments for free between bank accounts, a requirement that fraud be reimbursed the same day it is reported unless there are grounds to suspect it isn't actually fraud and a requirement that payments within the EU credit the next working day at the very latest.
Maybe the problem isn't regulation, it's that the US banking sector isn't regulated properly?

What the utter fuck are you talking about?
Let's be generous to you here and assume we can calculate a flat fee on an APR basis, even though that's retarded since a flat fee by definition never changes with the amount borrowed or period borrowed for which makes the calculations simply not make any sense but interest does, but anyway:
(£12.24 / £500) x 100 = 2.448% monthly interest rate  
((0.02448 + 1)^12 - 1) x 100 = 33.67% APR
Of course without the fee:
(£6.24 / £500) x 100 = 1.248%  
((0.01248 + 1)^12 - 1) x 100 = 16.04% APR
Neither of which are either above 50% or anywhere near the &gt;5000% Wonga charge.
You're talking bullshit. You are also ignoring two very salient facts:
1. Lloyds (and all other banks) make their tariffs very easy to find out upfront. There is no scam here even if you feel the price may be high - you are free not to borrow money from them. Speaking of which;
2. If you don't borrow any money you also don't pay any fees for borrowing money. If you did not want to borrow money on Lloyds' published and freely available terms then you shouldn't have done so. If you don't want to pay Lloyds to borrow their money then you should pay them back and not borrow money from them.

Bylls just converts the Bitcoin into Canadian dollars for a fee when you pay a bill with it. How is that better than just paying the bills with CAD? What if the price of Bitcoin crashes and the available rate isn't enough to pay your bills?

General public opinion isn't that they should be replaced or abolished, it is that they should be reformed and more heavily regulated to prevent them from doing harm.

That's the problem, it's all in theoretical. In the world we live in, where businesses around the world use different currencies to transact in, Bitcoin (while able to send money around the world) just means you're trading from your currency -&gt; Bitcoin -&gt; their currency, rather than your currency -&gt; their currency. In a putative world where Bitcoin is the sole global currency and everyone can use it to purchase all the goods and services they need (or merchants can use it to pay suppliers) it makes sense, but that world is nowhere near a reality and (in my view at least) is unlikely to ever exist.

The issue at hand in this putative court case (as far as I can tell) is that the company is placing limits on his account unjustifiably and withholding funds it owes him on the basis that he is selling mining hardware. It is not about them being against Bitcoin or hating Bitcoin. As such, internal memos, emails and presentations solely about the company's opinion on Bitcoin are not strictly relevant to the case.
What MIGHT be relevant are company memos regarding policy and procedure around the sale of Bitcoin mining equipment, inasmuch as they apply to the case itself. That is relevant. I am not a lawyer though, and this is based on just a rudimentary understanding.
Personally I think all that's happened is that the sudden large credit turnover on his PayPal account has led to suspicions about the provenance of the money, and the reps (due to "tipping off" someone suspected of money laundering that they are suspected of such being illegal) made up something to avoid divulging the truth. That's not illegal and is in fact required by law and regulation relating to financial institutions. It happens a lot with PayPal due to its nature being quite high risk for such things.

Where I would disagree with that is that I don't believe it to be evidence at all. People have posted long stories of woe and horror on Reddit and elsewhere before and they have turned out to be made up bullshit made up to get bites or, worse, monetary donations.
I think there are red flags here - for instance, and I've said this elsewhere, it's an almost too perfect way to get Bitcoiners onside if the rep actually made out like PayPal was fighting some sort of war against Bitcoin. That sets up an "us v them" thing and might get more bites.
Scepticism is the best thing whenever reading anything on the Internet, and I'd be sceptical if it was something *bad* for Bitcoin too, incidentally. I'd be interested to see what happens in the court case, if it gets that far.

Excellent stuff, except for one slight issue which makes your point entirely moot:
*FINRA IS AND WAS A SELF REGULATORY ORGANISATION*. It was subject to the *exact same issues* that any self-regulatory regime would be. It has absolutely fuck all to do with government financial services regulation of any type; it is an NGO. It had no governmental powers.

I resort to sarcasm because your position is bollocks. Mt. Gox *irrevocably lost* 5.7% of Bitcoin's entire monetary base in *one* organised fraud that would have been directly prevented, or at the very least the impact ameliorated, by measures along the lines of CASS. Bitcoin Savings and Trust lost around 2% of the monetary base in *one* fraud which would have had the impact ameliorated by FDIC and the extant regulatory barriers on unqualified and unvetted individuals being able to set up deposit taking institutions. There is frankly no fraud that massive in the history of regulated financial services. That would be the equivalent of Exxon, Apple and Microsoft being obliterated overnight.
Also, bailouts are and were a pragmatic move to shore up the capitalisation of banks by *purchasing assets they owned from them*, with regulatory steps then taken to prevent this from having to happen again, not least Basel III (with the wheels already in motion for Basel II when the financial crisis hit). That's entirely defensible and I'm interested to know what your response would have been given that just letting a load of financial institutions fail would have completely cratered the world economy.

It does render Bitcoin somewhat pointless if all the "big" merchants are just using Bitpay, since it's abundantly clear that the ones taking it don't actually care about Bitcoin, they just want to take some Bitcoiners' money while the going is good and the exchange rate is good too. If the merchant wants dollars or whatever, and the consumers mostly have dollars or whatever, what good does it do anyone to convert the dollars to Bitcoin to be sent to Bitpay to be converted back to dollars, other than to save the business a couple of percent on fees (which the consumer doesn't give a toss about anyway?)

A reasonably valid point. The Bitcoin community are overtly supportive of and can be quite aggressive about pushing things like anarcho-capitalism and agorism which are very much minority viewpoints and go against what a lot of people believe.

It's actually underscoring a point I've made quite a lot. Nobody is talking about regulating Bitcoin the currency in and of itself, what people calling for regulation want is regulation of businesses who handle Bitcoin in the same way as those who handle normal money are regulated (e.g. FDIC, MSB, AML, KYC, various other TLAs.) They most likely do not want the currency itself regulated since, on a pragmatic level at least, such a thing is not especially possible.
What the Bitcoiners seem to want en masse though is not only no regulation on the currency, but also no regulation on the money service businesses and banks surrounding it. Aside from this being untenable, it puts Bitcoin in a privileged position compared to other currencies despite its disproportionately greater risks.

Because unregulated financial services work amazingly. That's why when insurance and banking was self-regulated in the UK consumers always got a fair deal and nobody got systematically ripped off.
Oh wait it was shit, and it led to the PPI mis-selling scandal, which the FSA and FCA put an end to.
And Mt.Gox's complete lack of regulatory adherence worked out excellently when they mixed client and firm assets which meant when they went under, their customers' money went with them - something the FCA's CASS rules are explicitly meant to prevent.

It's rather sensible considering that Bitcoin's current primary use is as a speculative investment vehicle ("to the moon" etc) with the whole functioning economy thing being a small sideshow.

But in the same timespan *millions more people* bought things with their normal money than held onto it for speculative investments. With Bitcoin those proportions are vastly more tilted towards the hoarders.

I've got to side with the Bitcoiners on this one. Gox failing causing the price to crash is not counterparty risk, it is market risk. Counterparty risk would be Gox failing and taking your money with it directly.
The bit they fail to realise is that using *any* currency in a transaction exposes you to counterparty risk, because counterparty risk is simply the risk of the counterparty in a transaction or trade failing to perform their obligations. US dollars or pound sterling as cash don't have inherent counterparty risk either, but actually *use* them and you expose yourself to it.

It ends with whoever has the most guns and/or the biggest army being able to enforce their will upon everyone else, and workers being entirely at the mercy of their employers as to whether they have the ability to live or not. Perhaps similar to the current situation, however at least now you have a vote and the ability to run for office; in the case of anarcho-capitalism there's no accountability whatsoever.
Ancaps really don't like it when you point out that a monopoly on force is quite easily attained given enough force. It's the sort of position one can only really agree with if one ignores all the historical reasons and methods by which states were formed in the first place - not to mention, by getting rid of a government as it is now, you also have no method of preventing someone else from setting up another government, and given a vacuum a government of some sort *does* tend to form at some level.

But that's ridiculous. Given that circumstance you'd just use a bank transfer, because "moving the actual store of wealth" isn't what you want to do, you want to move X money to Y account. Anything seems bad if you choose the most ridiculously elongated and expensive way of doing it.
"You should pay to order your groceries online because if you don't want to use bags or a car you'll have to carry all your items home one by one from the shop" is more easily solved by carrying your shopping in bags or driving to the shop.


Bitcoin is not "taking over the world" by any rational measurement. Growing, perhaps, but not "taking over the world".


Sorry, but I *did* make an apples to apples comparison. I compared a consumer transaction involving me exchanging money for goods to a consumer transaction involving me exchanging money for goods. And in that comparison Bitcoin sucks. Hard. And it's that comparison everyone else will be making when they decide whether it makes sense to use Bitcoin or not, not a comparison between Bitcoin and sending an armoured car full of banknotes to Amazon's warehouse.

Fair use does not include using something for commercial purposes or advertising. The image is blatantly advertising as it is intended to sell a product or service (Bitcoin).
If he was criticising or reviewing the ad, for instance to deconstruct it or challenge its claims on a factual basis, then it would indeed be fair use. If it simply showed the Bitcoin half of it as is, so that it was recognisably a parody of the WU ad, that would be a parody and therefore fair use. However you cannot simply take a competitor's (being charitable) advert and place your own next to it and call that "fair use". Fair use is not a magic word which means that something is not copyright infringement just because you call it fair use.
That said, I don't see why WU bothered to have this taken down - the Bitcoin side is laughably inaccurate and all they've done by doing this is allow Bitcoiners to frot themselves into a froth with delusions about how WU is fighting them because they're scared.

"Outlawing Bitcoin" is impossible for the reasons you describe, correct - it's decentralised and not possible to stamp out without massive intrusions on personal privacy and liberty. What any legislative action would likely consist of is banning exchanges or prosecuting exchanges for existing laws (e.g. improper AML controls), which is entirely possible and has much the same effect in that no exchanges = Bitcoin economy withers. Just plain forbidding it is frankly impossible - you'd be looking at an infinitely more pointless War on Drugs-style debacle.
The ideal option would be for exchanges and other businesses that deal with Bitcoin in and of itself to be regulated as money service businesses so they can do business in accordance with the law, rather than just outright banning them. This would (should) satisfy both sides - government, because Bitcoin's potential use for money laundering is now in check and there's oversight on that country's use of the system, and Bitcoiners, because it gains the currency legitimacy. Just outright banning it would be an idiotic move.

This is kind of what I've been saying for a long time. If you want Bitcoin to succeed it needs to be sold to average people as doing something unique that they can't already do, or do something they already do in an entirely better way - as the Facebook to 2008s MySpace. In my view, the fact that a lot of Bitcoin's truly unique differentiating properties are only really interesting to hardcore libertarians and agorists is a significant problem for it, since while "being your own bank" and "hiding from the government" and "smashing the Fed" are significant concerns for these types, they simply aren't for consumers, who just want a means to pay for things.

Incorrect. The UK financial sector *was* self-regulated, but this was considered terrible and as such a new statutory regulator was introduced in the early 2000s, the Financial Services Authority. This was replaced early last year by the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority.
Incidentally, the LIBOR scandal led to a new offence being created of manipulating or falsifying a benchmark rate, to be enforced by the FCA.

Bitcoin is not a pyramid scheme. I say this as someone who doesn't like Bitcoin - it just isn't. Bullshit arguments don't help either side.
A pyramid scheme relies on its participants recruiting others in order for them to make money, which eventually becomes unsustainable as, mathematically, there are only so many people in the world to be recruited. There is no need for someone to recruit others to Bitcoin for them to use it or make profit from it (note: this does not mean they do not have to have other people using Bitcoin to make money, only that they do not have to *actively recruit* people who then pay them their income from the scheme) and there is no mathematical limit on the number of participants, other than the limited amount of Bitcoin in existence. It does not meet the definition therefore of a pyramid scheme.
Nor does it meet the definition of a Ponzi scheme (i.e. income to new investors is paid from the capital of old ones) as there is no income, only capital growth.
The only real characteristics Bitcoin shares with pyramid or Ponzi schemes are that new investors are required to increase the value of Bitcoin, and this isn't anything underhand, it is basic supply and demand. Whether its demand and therefore value is being driven up as a pump and dump scheme therefore (i.e. *voluntary* recruitment) is a very different and far more valid question. 
There are good, reality based grounds to criticise Bitcoin on without having to make things up.

People are either aware of this and/or don't care so long as their fraud gets reimbursed.


Blizzard's products all auto-renew don't they? They could defend against a chargeback with that reason - that you were told that the product would auto-renew in their terms, and it's not hidden. That would be a valid defense.
With the Steam case, personally I would complain to the bank. On the face of it that sounds like a valid chargeback.

If you're a Marxist you're pretty much an anarchist by definition as the end goal of Marxism is a stateless society - the difference from anarcho-capitalism as seen on here is that a Marxist stateless society would hold everything in commune (pure communism) as opposed to having strong property rights.
There is another thing they have in common: both goals are completely unattainable and/or undesirable for a variety of practical reasons.

No, it isn't, because that's bollocks. Accepting Bitcoin for payment and actually receiving Bitcoin is one thing; that Bitcoin will then be used by the business in some fashion and circulates further around the Bitcoin economy. Selling it immediately for dollars is, well, selling it. That is obvious. How can you misunderstand something so thoroughly basic?

That wasn't why actual electronic cash products like Visa Cash and Mondex (which was backed by MasterCard and large banks, so I'd be intrigued how your concept of a government conspiracy factors into that one) failed. The reason they failed is because they had no real use case over debit cards.
The reason e-Cash failed, similarly, was more mundane - they failed to sell the technology to anyone because their CEO was an asshole. They were approached by Microsoft to include it in Windows 95, but rebuffed them by making a ridiculous and unacceptable counter-offer. Same happened with Netscape.
E-Gold, meanwhile, failed because it was a hub for fraud, scams and money laundering on a massive scale and was quite deservedly prosecuted for that ( Bitcoin has many of the same issues and has similarly attracted ransomware developers, scammers and others looking to avoid law enforcement. True, decentralisation allows that, but I, frankly, do not care if my choice of payment system does not allow criminals to use it, makes it harder for people to scam others or requires the identities of its participants to be verified. In fact I'm quite happy with that.

He may also have triggered some sort of "lifetime deposit" limit. I know in this country at least, PayPal have a yearly deposit limit before they flag your account, and you have to send in further information to verify yourself if you want to go past that.
In any event, it's prudent, if someone is putting large amounts of money through a financial business, for that business to seek further information about their deposits. KYC and AML regulatory requirements are very strict, they place a strong burden on financial businesses to be very careful about who they do businesses with (which is a good thing, IMHO, you may disagree).

Remember that time when there was that big e-petition, and it got this massive multi-billion dollar company to change what they were doing and cater to a miniscule minority of people, JUST because some people got some signatures on a petition?
Oh wait, that never happened.
Amazon will accept Bitcoin when they feel there is sufficient profit in it to justify the development costs, something that may not happen since they are raking in money hand over fist from the vast, overwhelming majority of people with dollars, pounds and Euro that they will likely not get with Bitcoin in any scale to justify it. A petition does not make those numbers look rosier. Not to mention, their 1-click service would be impossible to implement as truly 1-click with Bitcoin, and purchases through mobile apps or Kindle would be near-impossible.

It's entirely *possible* that cryptocurrency could threaten banks, but whether it's likely to happen is an entirely different matter, and given the limitations of crypto I don't think it's going to happen.
As you say, businesses don't care, they'll accept whatever gets them enough money coming in vs. other payment methods to justify the implementation and operational cost. Apple would accept magic beans if there were enough people with magic beans to make selling music to them a viable market and the cost was proportionate. And there's no reason Apple couldn't sell someone an iPhone with Bitcoin (indeed, in a tangential sense, that already happens due to the online electronics merchants accepting it, if only via BitPay or whatever).

But that's bollocks too, because Austrian school supposes that the product of this analytic methodology (methodology which is nowhere near settled) *is* reality, or will be if Austrians get their way. If it isn't, or the methodology is flawed, then the whole thing falls apart.
It's just one of the ways Austrian economics simply disregards reality or basic scientific principles. Austrian school also holds that the mere *existence* of a government distorts outcomes and that any market or economic failure of any kind can be ascribed to the existence of a government, a proposition which is inherently not falsifiable unless government ceases to exist (at which point, obviously, the Austrian school have their key goal anyway). There is also the matter of statistics being considered worthless in the Austrian school, which given that statistics are pretty much all anyone can measure with regards to the outcome of economic policies also makes it even more pseudoscientific and unfalsifiable - again, reality is disregarded because it does not come in the form the AS likes.
I don't agree with the conclusions Austrian economics draws, quite obviously, but I could stomach it far more if its end goals were argued for honestly - not with nonsensical concepts like "praxis" and not simply rejecting facts out of hand but simply stating them as what they are - beliefs. Not facts or theories reached as the result of any scientific process, because they're not - the "theory", such as it is, has clearly been constructed around the anarcho-capitalist  beliefs of its founders, rather than the beliefs being formed from and refined by the theory. To put it in the same category as the work of Keynes and Friedman is insulting.

It's not really good news for Bitcoin the payment system either, because if both ends of the transaction are only in it for normal currency (e.g. someone who lives in the US and wants to spend some money in the US) then Bitcoin is already a less efficient and more cost-prone system than, say, debit cards due to the exchange spread that'd be incurred at both ends and the extra steps involved in changing money to Bitcoin to be sent to someone else who then converts it back to regular money.
Hell, even if only one end is doing the conversion, that's still not good for Bitcoin the payment system, since it means that they are sensitive to Bitcoin price shocks. It's possible that should the Bitcoin price go too low, people sitting on vast Bitcoin "wealth" end up with a fraction of the value they had, which directly impacts the size of the market for those accepting Bitcoin. Meanwhile, someone with USD or whatever, or someone accepting such, is pretty much guaranteed their money is going to be worth roughly the same thing tomorrow, no matter how it's delivered.
The only way Bitcoin makes sense is in a pure Bitcoin economy, which is such a far off pipe dream that it frankly doesn't bear thinking about.

With my normal money, I have options: I can use PayPal or my debit card, knowing that banks abide by confidentiality rules, not least the Data Protection Act which provides for legal penalties should that confidentiality be breached without good cause, and that the knowledge of my putative buttplug purchase is entirely between me and the bank's database (this is not to say that banks *never* breach confidentiality, just that the possibility is incredibly remote).
If I'm more paranoid, I can use cash, in which case I am entirely anonymous and there is absolutely no record anywhere of me personally walking into Mr Stickitupyourshitter's fabulous shop and handing over my filthy lucre. Either way these payment methods are effortless on my part and the effort I require to hide my purchase is minimal at best (in a transactional sense, of course, hiding the buttplug itself is a matter for an entirely different subreddit.)
With Bitcoin, the situation is different. Any transaction I perform is logged as part of the blockchain. If I were to use my regular wallet and someone was out to see what I put up my arse of an evening then they could clearly see the payment going from me to the emporium, I'm rumbled, whatever negative consequences happen happen and I have no recourse to anyone. If I have to launder/tumble my money before I hand it over to the emporium, I have to first of all actually do that in the first place whereas I don't with cash or debit card, I have to trust the tumbler to give me the right amount of money back and also hope that using the tumbler doesn't also get me in deep shit because the same tumbler was being used by the Nozkandi cartel in Mexico and now I look like an accessory (or have to come out and say "yes I was laundering my Bitcoins because I wanted to buy a big fucking buttplug the size of an orange" in which case my privacy is broken anyway). I also have to hope that the tumbler itself isn't overloaded at some point and doesn't just spit the same coins back to me, at which point me and my purchase are still traceable.
I'll say again what I said elsewhere - if privacy is your concern then using Bitcoin is frankly idiotic, since the nature of it is so very open. Yes, I don't have to trust anyone to keep my information secure, but that's because I'm not keeping my information secure in the first place. I myself have nothing to hide (I have neither a desire for drugs nor buttplugs) but the fact *everyone can see what I do* is a significant reason why I do not want to touch Bitcoin with a shitty buttplug I mean stick.

Very true - it's the same reason why the war on drugs is idiotic.
LocalBitcoin might work, but this then is a significant step down for anyone wanting to adopt Bitcoin - with LB being the only available option, you'd see the number of scammers on there (already well north of zero) absolutely explode. Even without that, it does absolutely nothing for Bitcoin's reputation, making it look shady and, well, unlawful. There is also nothing saying that LocalBitcoin couldn't be shut down either.
(Incidentally, and to make this clear, since I'm a very vocal critic of Bitcoin; I'm not saying this is something I want to happen. There's no reason for it.)

How is that a good answer? Right now, they do. If they want to pay taxes, or mortgages, or buy groceries, they need to convert. Focusing on your transaction costs is helpful to you and Bitcoin because the very operation of Bitcoin is based on the costs of processing being externalised from users onto miners and, in this case, recipients.
Just handwaving and saying "in the future they won't need to" isn't a good answer because it assumes something that may never happen - the complete replacement of all fiat currencies with Bitcoin. That's wishful thinking on a massive scale.

You are going to get a lot of circlejerky responses about fiat being theft, directing you to Bitcoiner websites because they want you to write a paper that's overly positive about Bitcoin. I would STRONGLY advise you do your own research and find different sources aside from the ones linked here, since you will be given a very one-sided view on A good set of points would be:
* The different competing currencies that have attempted to be adopted, both before and after the issuance of Federal Reserve notes (i.e. dollar bills), and how they compared to both FR notes and to Bitcoin
* The impact of regulation upon Bitcoin and the present laws that might restrict its uptake or ease of exchange
* A comparison of Bitcoin to both dollars (as a currency) and to existing payment methods such as credit cards, debit cards, bank transfers, etc, and why consumers might adopt Bitcoin over them or conversely prefer them over Bitcoin, and a study of how this might turn out for each
* How Bitcoin might scale if it were to get into mass adoption (e.g. would it be able to handle enough transactions per second to be used in place of say, Visa at point of sale)
* The ramifications of Bitcoin potentially being used in a mass market way (e.g. potential devaluation of the dollar with knock on effects for other global economies, pseudo-anonymous use of the currency and the implications of that for, say, the black market and for AML legislation)
* How Bitcoin is presently used and how this stacks up against the usage of those other competing currencies mentioned before.
* The socio-political implications (e.g. Bitcoin being used as a "wedge" by anarchist/anarcho-capitalist groups in order to try to destabilise government and central banks; what would happen if this were to succeed?)

Self regulation worked so poorly in UK financial services, and created so many consumer failures, that it was abolished and statutory bodies were created for oversight. Seriously, go look it up. The FCA and PRA aren't perfect by any stretch, but they're a damn sight better than nothing.

@_date: 2014-07-12 20:53:01
Not much, because the whole of the retail banking system (the bit Bitcoin is most concerned with) is predicated either on providing services in exchange for fees (which can happen with Bitcoin, and already does - c.f. Coinbase, exchange fees, ATM fees, let alone miner's fees) or on lending money at interest, which is only really an issue with Bitcoin because due to Bitcoin's nature you'd have a rapidly growing debts coupled to a near-permanent credit crunch, not due to any form of issue with interest charging itself.
The banking and financial services industry in general does do an awful lot of necessary and useful things, often in ways that are completely transparent to most people but which are crucial to keeping the economy going and are in fact beneficial to most people. Lending to businesses alone is an enormous driver of economic growth, enough that its choking off in 2008 certainly didn't help with the resulting economic crises experienced around the world.

You misunderstand. Inflation is a very specific term, specific to economics. It does not include the price or value of *investments*. It means the price of *goods and services*.
Your definition either makes Bitcoin a "good" (in an economic sense) when it is intended as a currency, which also makes the comparison between Bitcoin and investments apples and oranges, or makes Bitcoin an investment in its own right to make the comparison valid, in which case "inflation" is not the right term at all.
Really, inflation isn't the right word.
Incidentally, and completely aside from the semantic thing, price increases/possible capital gains is not the only reason one might choose an investment. Bitcoin is very, very, very high risk in investment terms, in that its price is extremely volatile and subject to shocks, it has no real backing to it (i.e. buying a Bitcoin doesn't actually buy you a share in anything, unlike stocks or investment funds) and you are at the mercy of unregulated businesses in order to do anything with it. As such most people should not touch it with a bargepole. Additionally, it pays no dividends, which makes it unsuitable for those who wish to invest to get an income compared to, again, stocks and other securities.

That doesn't source your figure for 100 million people sending remittances. At all. It only gives monetary figures, unless you're assuming that *everyone* who is an international migrant sends remittances.
And, regardless, even if I granted your point (which I don't), Bitcoin still means converting to and from at both ends of a transaction and finding someone to purchase Bitcoin from and sell it to, which introduces extra hassle, extra steps, extra costs and more volatility. It could lead to the real world value of someone's remittance being wiped out entirely before they have a chance to use it.

That's cool and all - but it still doesn't get the consumer their money back. If I've just dropped money on a meal I didn't get/gave me food poisoning, and they won't give it back, then bad word of mouth is not going to get them to refund me. A chargeback will.
You also have to bear in mind that some restaurants - and businesses in general - *already* stiff people and *already* overcharge people and are *already* dishonest, and that's *with* a system where they can have the charge disputed in such an eventuality. They obviously do not care enough about the word of mouth to do so *now*, when there are even worse consequences - why should they care when there are *no* consequences other than the word of mouth?


The problem is we already have products which work perfectly well for this purpose, and while adding escrow etc. to Bitcoin makes them work *OK* for it, there's not really any convincing USP for anyone involved (bar the potential of lower fees for the merchant).

* "A central private bank prints money out of thin air forever" - good, because first off the money supply should expand with the economy or else you get deflation which is fucking terrible, secondly because monetary policy provides a lever to counteract recessions and depressions
* "a privately owned central bank owning my money" - central banks do not "own your money", you're talking shit (I will bet dollars to doughnuts your response to this will involve linking me to Mises.org, ZeroHedge or a YouTube video)
* "a central private payments processor that can lock me out of my funds with the push of a button" - can do but probably hasn't done and generally doesn't do so, meanwhile providing numerous other benefits to you over and above just using cash
* "work better that a decentralised open source payment system, that no government can shut down" - yes. Bitcoin solves no problems that most people care about while introducing new problems of its own such as a lack of consumer protection, absolutely no recourse in the event of fraud, a pointlessly complex "decentralised" architecture that in reality just leads to inefficiency and the growth of large mining pools which can easily coalesce to control the whole currency - only unlike a central bank, completely unaccountably and with only regard for personal profit, massive waste of precious natural resources performing useless sums, terrible scalability...

What the utter Christ are you talking about?
Self-regulation in the UK consisted solely of banks, insurance companies and others literally regulating themselves, without any oversight whatsoever or any accountability of any kind. It failed. It failed miserably. We now have oversight and accountability through regulatory agencies - it is a great deal better. Not perfect - but much, much, much better for all concerned - businesses AND consumers, businesses because they have clearly defined rules and boundaries, consumers because the businesses get the ever loving fuck beaten out of them should they step out of line. This includes a free, independent arbitrator (the Financial Ombudsman Service) to adjudicate on complaints where consumers and businesses cannot agree on a way forward.
I frankly cannot really be bothered to read or respond in detail to the rest of your post when you show such a fundamental misunderstanding of what you're talking about, although a skim reading suggests that you think that if we just reduce everything down to "fraud" then regulation is unnecessary, that misconduct by advisers is caused by regulation allowing them to commit misconduct (?!) and that the solution to this supposed issue is not to get better regulation (as here, where businesses are simply not allowed to hide behind buried clauses and must be upfront about important issues, as well as demonstrating customer understanding and suitability where advice is given) but to get rid of it entirely, despite the clear and demonstrable harms that deregulated financial services cause.

SWIFT is simply a far, far better and more efficient system for payments and interbank communication than Bitcoin could ever hope to be, unless the entirety of the world economy switches over to Bitcoin, which is simply not going to happen.

Many sites require confirmations because not waiting for confirmations leaves them at risk of a double spend.

That is an outright lie.

Some questions:
1. How have the SEC made this *worse*, as opposed to the situation of there being no regulation at all? Why would having no regulation on risky practises at all be a better thing?
2. Are you actually aware that "depositor" is a very poor description of someone dealing with MF Global (who are a derivatives firm) or anyone who was invested in Madoff's Ponzi scheme?
3. Are you also aware that the issue with Madoff was not "gambling with depositor money" (inasmuch as Madoff had "depositors") but was in fact that Bernie Madoff was a con artist and the whole thing was rotten from the ground up?
4. Are you also aware that since MF Global and other similar scandals, client asset rules have been strengthened both in the US and elsewhere to prevent financial services firms from mixing firm and client monies in the way MF Global did, with substantial and intrusive oversight of the same from regulators? Rules that also ensure that in the event of an investment firm's collapse, clients' funds will be ringfenced and available to be paid out to clients?
5. Can you name any actual retail banks who did fail due to "gambling with depositor money", given that that is what Neo&amp;Bee would have been had they had any semblance of financial controls?
The answers, in case you're lazy:
1. They haven't. No regulation would make things worse instead of better. The repeal of Glass-Steagall alone helped destabilise the market, the complete removal of the SEC or its equivalents would be insane. Financial services is as heavily regulated as it is for a reason; because having the financial sector unregulated *harmed people*.
2. You clearly aren't, as neither MF Global nor Madoff were banks.
3. You also aren't aware of this, because again Madoff was not a bank.
4. You aren't aware of this either, because it would render your entire point (irrelevant though it is) moot and wouldn't fit into your narrative.
5. You can't, because there aren't any.

Yes. You're right. That is what reserves means. They aren't loaned out. Therefore, more stable banks. The reserves are a *good* thing. They also mean that the banks concerned are able to more flexibly make loans, as is also a good thing, because the US economy is growing.

"Make math the regulator" is one of those things that sounds nice until you actually think about it:
* A regulator can apply punishments if someone abuses the market; math can't
* A regulator can set rules on who can do what as part of a market to restrict toxic, dangerous, destabilising or just downright fraudulent tactics; math can't 
* A regulator can make sure that those who do try to defraud others are prevented from ever trying to do so again; math can't
Math is a shitty regulator. A good regulator sets rules for others to follow and beats the ever loving fuck out of them should they transgress. Math is able to do the former but sure as hell can't do the latter.
To put it bluntly, an actual regulator would have seen the GHash.io thing coming and put in place rules about how large mining pools can be and what they can do with that power. Math can't do fuck, especially since as soon as GHash gets over 50% the math is *under their control*.
And before I get the inevitable; that is not saying that currently extant examples of regulation in financial services are *perfect*, it is that the current extant examples of regulation in financial services *actually do something*.

Bitcoin is not a Ponzi scheme. It is being used as part of a pump and dump, in my view (something that isn't intrinsic to it, incidentally), but it isn't a Ponzi scheme, chiefly because a Ponzi requires others to buy in to generate investment returns, while with Bitcoin there *are* no returns other than capital gains, and a Ponzi is run by one organisation, while Bitcoin could not rationally be said to be hawked by one person.

@_date: 2014-02-11 19:31:49
I was actually asking a genuine question. Which you didn't answer.


Take a look around briefly and you'll find any number of people who want Bitcoin to completely replace banks and "fiat".
Hell, even if it didn't completely replace the world financial system, Bitcoin would be insanely incompetent at operating any more than a minute percentage of it. Again, a statistic I like quite a lot is that Visa's peak is 11,000 transactions per second - that's just retail transactions processed using just Visa's network. Bitcoin would choke on even a third of that.


It's still grossly inefficient and will push out those who aren't intent on devoting large amounts of storage space to other peoples' transactions just to be able to make their own - I don't need to hold my bank's entire transactional log to pay my credit card (indeed, it'd be weird if I did.)
And if you're going to move to a cloud service like Electrum then the whole "trustless" and decentralised aspect goes away, which aside from completely obliterating one of Bitcoin's unique selling points also raises the question as to how trustless and decentralised it really is to begin with when to scale up any more than a little bit it almost *requires* centralisation and the use of third party services.


I wasn't going to anyway, but a hardfork does seem likely given the number of issues that need fixing before Bitcoin is anywhere near primetime. And until that point, people (not necessarily you, incidentally) should probably stop promoting it as a panacea.

The world's economy is very interdependent at this point, with the US and the dollar at the centre of it. Were the dollar to collapse then, if not civilization, then pretty much the entire world economy would follow with it. Of course, again, this is a far off and very unlikely possibility, since the dollar is very stable, is the world's reserve currency and, given the first fact above, is something pretty much everyone has a vested interest in keeping going.

2. Wait while they open the account and/or answer questions about the account, then get account number
3. Take money to cashier, hand them money with account number and ask to deposit it
4. When you get the card in the post (and the PIN if applicable) take it to the grocery store and hand the card to the clerk at the checkout. Enter PIN if necessary, otherwise sign a slip.
Hmm, really hard that is. Much harder than the convoluted two paragraph clusterfuck of the OP.
Although given that Bitcoin is, strictly speaking, a currency and not a payment method such as a debit card, there's another simpler option:

OK, ALMOST everyone, excepting the ancap fringe who inhabit this subreddit like herpes sores on your mother.


I stopped reading because your definition of "property rights" is completely at odds to both the society we live in and common sense.  That hasn't changed.
Societies have laws for a reason. Societies, through governments, as an expression of the will of that society through democratic means, which you may not like the outcome of but which are still valid, believe that certain things should be prohibited or regulated. These laws were built up over time after gradual realisation that they were *necessary*. I cannot, frankly, be bothered arguing with someone who thinks that this should all be torn up overnight because he doesn't like some of it. If you want marijuana legalised or whatever, cool, so do I, but it doesn't justify destroying everything in the name of a reductive philosophy like "property rights".


So you propose in its place not reform of that system but abandoning it completely? That's fucking idiotic beyond words. Please, pray tell also what "criminal actions" have been "legalised", especially since in your magical proposed la-la land virtually everything would be legal (since the definition of "fraud" has not changed, so fraud is still fraud).
Of course, your example, upthread, of someone "hiding" statements in a disclosure document isn't fraud either (since the terms are plainly there for inspection, caveat emptor right?), and was certainly possible before these evil regulations you claim allow it, and would certainly be possible if you got your wish of abolishing them, so what the fuck exactly is your point?

99 transactions over the last month. 1 transaction (£80 cash deposit) required going into a branch, the rest were completed online, via POS or via Direct Debit/standing order. That's close enough to 1% for my liking.
If you're having branch problems, I feel bad for you son; I had 99 transactions but a teller's just one.

You seem to think the white paper containing the words "electronic cash" somehow negates the fact that Bitcoin is currently being touted as a replacement for credit cards, debit cards, bank accounts and virtually every other financial product besides.
Your issue should be with the breathless promotion of it for things that - and this is where I actually agree with you - cash has absolutely no business doing. It may not be a good replacement for cards (and it really, really, REALLY isn't) but that is how it is being marketed to people who simply do not know better.

This is just a nonsense argument on multiple levels.
1. An "average" necessitates that some charge higher prices and some charge lower. As such "higher than average profit" could mean absolutely anything, and is entirely possible in competitive markets. If you had 100 competitors charging a range of prices between $50 and $100 for a good then roughly half would be charging "above average". This is clearly not monopolistic, but by your standards it is.
2. Having profits over and above the costs of your business, including staff (golly, I never thought they might cost money too!) is perfectly normal and in fact desirable, for instance to pay dividends to shareholders or to set aside for future investment in the business, or to pay down debts.
3. The price businesses can can charge is the price the market will bear. If the market considers these prices unreasonable, people will not buy the products and will buy a competitor's products at a more reasonable price instead (barring value differentiation). The only time this doesn't work is WITH a monopoly, where there is no choice to be had.
Your argument, frankly, is bullshit.

No. He was nailed for being the compliance officer of a *licensed* money transmission service while deliberately aiding and abetting criminals using his service to launder money.


Assuming that money isn't criminal proceeds, in a legal sense then no it isn't, but the actual process is identical to laundering money. Tumbling is laundering by another name - you are looking to obfuscate/disguise the source of where funds came from, taking "dirty" money and making it look "clean". The key things are though:
1. People doing legitimate things have no need to launder money, since they have no need to disguise the source. It's completely pointless and just wastes your time. (I know this sounds like "If you aren't doing anything wrong..." but the sheer expense and inconvenience of laundering money makes this pretty much true.)
2. Given 1, the fact that you're laundering money at all, even if it's clean, looks *terribly* suspicious.

That's not intrinsic value. Bitcoin has none. Any value Bitcoin has, in common with all other fiat currencies (hell, all other currencies) is ascribed to it by others. If nobody wanted your Bitcoin or you couldn't transfer them anywhere, they would be worthless. Compare this to gold, say, where even at its most basic you've got a pretty shiny metal, the prettiness and shininess of which adds value to it. Or you have a paperweight. Or you can fashion it into electronics if you're skilled enough. Bitcoin meanwhile offers nothing except that you have proof you own a certain amount of some cryptographic hashes.

So you've never used a minor or obscure online retailer, or just a minor or obscure retailer in general?


We're not talking about Bitcoin exchanges though. We're talking about merchants. Although exchanges are a whole 'nother kettle of fish (the issue there is not the irreversibility of Bitcoin, it is the ludicrously poor oversight and regulation of exchanges, often because the exchanges do everything in their power to avoid such.)


I agree. Bitcoin is and was invented to be Internet cash. That's a decent goal, Bitcoin achieved it. However:
1. That is NOT a good thing to use for distance selling under ANY circumstances, because you have the situation where fly-by-nights looking to scam people out of their hard earned cash develop as per my post above, and/or small businesses become considered inherently untrustworthy which leads to their having a large portion of their sales cut off as one cannot try a new or unknown business without a significant risk of irrevocably losing one's money. You can argue that "well that would be the purchaser's fault" but then you're essentially arguing that anyone has free rein to scam anyone they like and it would be the fault of the victim for falling for it, which is frankly abhorrent. Not to mention, this sort of thing *already happens* in the "fiat" world, and the traceability and lack of complete anonymity for the "merchants" leads to their being tracked down and punished for it, and the customers who have been defrauded being made whole. Bitcoin shopping is fundamentally the same as sending cash through the mail or Western Union, and just as idiotic.
2. If you have to build extra institutions on top of Bitcoin in order to make Bitcoin passable for daily transactions, what is the point unless you're some ideologue who wants to use Bitcoin just because it's Bitcoin? Why would we assume that these new Bitcoin institutions would be any better, especially given the appalling performance and governance of a large number of financial businesses in the Bitcoin space, and the fact these services would necessarily have to charge fees of some level to survive? We already *have* working institutions, on top of working currencies, and Bitcoin adds nothing most people care about to this - not to mention, by having these institutions, the supposed benefits of decentralisation and pseudonymity go right out the window, making the entire endeavour even more pointless.
(Further discussion of why irrevocable cash that can be compromised through a virus or by someone taking a picture of a QR code is a really, really bad idea is outside of this discussion.)


The merchants, because allowing people to try new businesses with the promise that they will be made whole.
You do also realise that chargebacks can be defended against? If someone claims they did not receive their goods, for instance, the business can push back against the chargeback by supplying proof of delivery. It's not just a case of someone raising a chargeback and then the merchant being stiffed the money.
It also doesn't happen anywhere near as often as you think it does. Chargebacks are *rare* (as they should be). So called "friendly fraud" is even rarer. It is something that people push because it enables sympathy for Bitcoin (note that Tiger Direct and Overstock, the two companies most famous for adopting Bitcoin, are well known for their lacklustre policies regarding returns and their outright taking of peoples' money in exchange for no or different/substandard goods. See [here]( and [here](


Sorry but that doesn't fly. You can't just handwave away all the awful shit that happens because it was old. Bitcoin, in its lifetime, has been an absolute magnet for scams and frauds - disproportionately so for the size of its economy and monetary base.


Tell that to people who had their computers compromised with a virus and lost all their money never to be seen again. Or who paid Overstock or Tiger Direct with Bitcoin and never received the goods they paid for.

You say that like going to court is free, quick and easy.
Here, if someone fleeced me of £1200, I'd have to pay £70 upfront before the court even knew about this, with no guarantee of success. If I won, I'd then have to enforce the judgment, which also costs money, and may result in the defendant having no money to pay me back and therefore getting away with it. I also have to take time away from work and out of my day to physically go to court and present my case. At worst, I'd get nothing back, be down the £70 (and enforcement costs) with the slight satisfaction of knowing the scammer's credit is ruined.
Compare that with chargeback. Credit card company looks over evidence, decides in favour of whoever has the best case, free, simple, easy, 100% guarantee of being refunded if the evidence is in my favour.

That and the absurd idea that banks are "scared" of Bitcoin, and that's why they keep closing the accounts of Bitcoin exchanges and such (hint: no, they're just aware of the exchanges' woeful AML and KYC policies which expose them to direct risk.)
They don't seem to have twigged that if the banks genuinely thought Bitcoin was viable enough to fuck them over they would *adopt it*, being as banks are profit seeking businesses and will go where there's a viable market for them.

Yes. Where a firm has a blanket authorisation, its employees are operating under its umbrella and it is responsible for any advice given by employees of that firm while they act as representatives of it. A key issue in the recent PPI mis-selling scandal was that staff not certified or trained to offer advice were recommending people take it (for whatever reason), and as these employees of their respective banks were operating under the banks' collective authorisation this shifted the liability for the sale from the seller personally to their employer, as they were doing so under the employer's regulatory permission to sell insurance and give advice, not their own. Where a person is individually authorised, on the other hand, they personally bear the responsibility for their advice and are responsible for making good any losses.
Think about how things would work if that wasn't the case - there would be no downside to a firm collectively authorised to give advice just employing a heap of untrained simpletons and letting them give bad advice to customers, since the firm would get all the profit from the mis-selling and wouldn't have to pay actual advisers to sell stuff, but would have none of the liability for the duff advice their employees gave.
(This is from a UK perspective, other jurisdictions may be different.)


The client would probably have been taken aback by the firm employing someone who was willing to spout some fairly wacko political views at them, and pushing Bitcoin on them. I can imagine that making someone feel uncomfortable with a firm.


Point is the IT guy is employed by the dealership. If the dealership lets their employee say shit like that to customers without stopping them from doing so then that speaks volumes about their judgment. Same here.

The US government has shown an almost total apathy towards Bitcoin right up until the point it has been used as part of other crimes, such as drug dealing and money laundering, and the charges for those cases haven't been "using Bitcoin", it's been drug dealing and money laundering.

The pound loses a relatively predictable amount of its value each year - inflation at present hovers around 1.3%. If you can get a return on your money of at least 1.3% (easily achievable with cash savings accounts and ISAs) then your money does not lose value.
Saying "the pound has lost 84394389% of its value since its inception" is meaningless when hedges against that loss were and are widely available and when wages and incomes have risen by roughly the same amount anyway. It also ignores that people don't in general just hold cash under mattresses, you have it in a deposit account or invest in something to take a return over the rate of inflation.
Meanwhile, Bitcoin's value and purchasing power fluctuates daily and has lost 67.14% of its value (in USD - which is another issue, since inflation is measured against goods prices, whereas Bitcoin prices necessarily have to be measured in USD since nobody prices goods in Bitcoin) over the last year. It has, in fairness, also gained a couple thousand percent of value, but that was a rise created by market manipulation, and just underlines that it is simply a terrible store of value.
You do sound like you are aware of all this, so if you do want to go play on the tracks then go right ahead, just please make some sort of provision for when the train hits you.

There is a certain limit before VAT is incurred. If you sell goods under that limit then you are not required to charge VAT or register for VAT (the flipside being that if you're registered, you can claim the VAT back on business related purchases that you make).
Also, VAT from my reading wouldn't apply to Bitcoin itself. It would apply to fees charged by exchanges. Most incorporate these into the spread from my understanding, so I'm not sure what difference it makes.

@_date: 2014-02-17 18:04:03
It's also worth pointing out that transferring money through Bitcoin is not strictly *free* - even leaving aside income from fees, it still costs money to operate the network, in the sense that miners have to pay for their electricity to hash transactions and for their networks to upload such things to the P2P network. The difference between it and a bank transfer is that with bank transfer processing costs are paid directly by the person requesting the movement; with Bitcoin they are externalised onto everyone else operating the network. It may not cost the end user money, but it certainly costs *someone* money.

That's not fractional reserve. Fractional reserve would be if they only had 90% of the funds they actually owed users. If they have all of the funds then it is nothing like fractional reserve.
Of course, in the case of a "run" on Mt Gox and them not being able to return everyone's money, it wouldn't be fractional reserve either, because Gox didn't lend the money out with an expectation of it being returned, they're just insolvent. Some might call that "misappropriation of client assets", which under most financial regulatory regimes is a severe breach of regulations and subject to severe penalties, but of course, Gox isn't regulated is it...

Sorry, but this is a bollocks talking point. Criminals will exploit any and all chinks in the armour of the financial system - open an avenue for them to launder drug money and get away with it and they will flock to it. It happened with banks, it happened with PayPal and it's happening now with Bitcoin. All exempting smaller "legitimate and honest" businesses from AML regulations does, and that seems to be what you're implying you want, is ensure that they will rapidly become used as a conduit for dirty money and therefore explicitly aiding criminals. Not especially "legitimate and honest".
It's a burden, but it's a legitimately necessary burden and one that is remarkably easy to comply with - identify your customers and understand the nature of what they're doing with your service. If a business considers those basic steps too much of a pain in the hole then frankly they shouldn't be working in anything involving money because god knows what else they'd consider too much hassle. Frankly your view is a sophomoric one which shows you up as having absolutely no knowledge about financial crime or money laundering bar that which you've heard from libertarians on And, finally, these aren't "additional" laws and regulations, they are the current laws and regulations as exist at this point in time. If you don't want to comply with those then please don't be surprised and cry foul if you are eventually prosecuted. A legitimate and honest business would comply with the law.

The legal system works on evidence. So let's look at the evidence.
So on the one hand, there's Bob receiving a bunch of electronics shipped to Bob's house and now sitting in Bob's house that were bought with stolen credit cards that Bob does not dispute receiving or ordering.
On the other, Bob says he used an anonymous service so he could pay in Bitcoin, and that as a result some other guy he cannot name used the stolen credit cards to order all the electronics to his house in his name.

For good reason - the ability to have cash converted anonymously into anonymous Internet money that can then be spent at will is an absolute goldmine for money launderers.
A few quick and obvious steps with an anonymous Bitcoin ATM and a third party exchange or LocalBitcoins and you have nice clean "legit" money rather than the dirty cash you got from pimping women out for money/selling smack to children/selling illegal weapons to criminals/raising money to fund terrorist attacks/fencing stolen goods/killing for hire/etc etc etc. (All reasons used for laundering money, intended without hyperbole.)

Granted, but the basic issue, and the chief reason it isn't a pyramid scheme, is that in a pyramid scheme the *only* income a particular person will get from being in it will be if they recruit more people - nothing has actually been purchased or is owned, you cannot "sell on" your stake, all you've got is the right to rope more people into the pyramid scheme. Bitcoin does not *require* you to recruit anyone - it is perfectly possible to buy a single Bitcoin, a Bitcoin which you will then own, and just sit on it to see if the price rises. You can also sell it back and cash out at any time (barring the unregulated and generally dodgy exchanges.) This makes it distinct from a pyramid scheme, which is essentially based on nothing. You say that "early adopters get rich by charging new recruits for a product that is not valuable for anything but selling to yet more new recruits", but the fact that there is a product to sell at all makes this very distinct from a pyramid.
What Bitcoin is (arguably) subject to at present is a pump-and-dump scam. Current holders encourage others to buy in with the incentive of large profits and using false positive statements, or omitting negative statements (greed is a common motivator used by scam artists) knowing that due to supply and demand the purchase of Bitcoin by others will lead to the value of their holding going up, while not actually disclosing this fact. Once it is at a high enough value, the Bitcoin can be dumped for profit, and the later buyers are screwed. There is some overlap here with a pyramid scheme, but by and large it is not one - a pyramid scheme is created with the intention of fraud, a pump and dump security is often a legitimate penny stock that others have latched onto.
So to summarise, Bitcoin is a pump and dump and not strictly a pyramid scheme because:
1. A pyramid scheme confers ownership of nothing; a pump and dump requires the purchase of an asset which theoretically has value and can be priced according to supply and demand (like Bitcoin)
2. A pyramid scheme has no potential for benefit outside of selling other people into the pyramid; it is possible to benefit from a pumped commodity without actually recruiting anyone else (i.e. selling your stock/Bitcoin when the price goes up)
3. A pyramid scheme is created specifically to defraud people, as it is obvious from before it starts that it is unsustainable; penny stocks used for pump and dump scams can be innocent parties that others use to commit the fraud (I would argue Bitcoin falls into that category; I doubt Satoshi thought that far ahead as to create Bitcoin solely to see the value get overinflated at a level few people could rationally predict like it is now,although it is entirely possible - if he did he makes Madoff look like a rank amateur).
Of course, pump and dump scams are controlled by regulation, as unlisted penny stocks (owing to their usage for such things) are given substantial oversight by financial regulators to ensure they are not being used for this purpose. Bitcoin and its adherents are of course quite resistant on the whole to regulation of any sort, which is convenient because pump-and-dump scams are straight up fraud.


This bit I agree with. Bitcoin's currently dominant use is as a commodity or stock-like instrument, and the current bubble is proof of that.

There's no increase in the *number* of monetary units - there's still 1 coin, but if those coins are then split into 10 and used as an equivalent then that's a ten-fold increase in the money supply - and then again if it goes to 0.01 and so on.

Easily countered by this: how do the people who accept Bitcoin then pay for what they're selling? Take the OP's example of the camera. The people BitcoinStore buy the camera off to sell it will want dollars. If there is no quick and easy way to exchange Bitcoin for dollars then BitcoinStore has either a shitload of stock it can't shift or a lot of Bitcoin it can't do anything with.
Or say you're a craftsman selling a chair you made yourself. You still have to buy wood, glue, varnish etc, and unless you find a timber yard or DIY place that sells stuff in Bitcoin then you're shit out of luck accepting Bitcoin for a chair if you can't then exchange it for dollars, since you have no means to pay for the raw materials used to make the chair.
This would lead to either one of two ends: the Bitcoin-only economy grows to fill the need, or it withers on the vine and dies. My wager is that the second is more likely due to the far, far, far greater number of financial obligations people have denominated in normal currency.

The Internet and Bitcoin are not comparable.

Bitcoin, meanwhile, largely does not let people do anything they can't already do with products that already exist, and offers nothing to the average person over what they already have.

Barriers to entry are a *great* thing in financial services.

Mt Gox could not have happened under a properly regulated system precisely because of the necessary barriers to entry restricting that idiot Karpeles from ever getting anywhere near anyone's money.

So before regulation existed, everyone behaved amazingly and market conduct was always brilliant? Before AML laws were brought in, banks willingly did not accept deposits from criminals? Before capitalisation requirements were brought in, no banks became insolvent because their capital was insufficient? Before client assets regulations were brought in, investment firms always kept their clients' money separate from their own and when one of them went under everyone got their money back?
You are talking absolute, 100% nonsense. Having regulations there doesn't make people flout them to earn money, you have cause and effect the wrong way around. Having regulations there provides for serious personal consequences for those who deliberately act in unethical or imprudent ways in order to earn money - people can still act in the same way they could before, but there are now consequences to doing so and therefore a deterrent and means of redress should it happen. The idea that you posit that the regulations themselves are somehow a catalyst for people being unethical or imprudent is idiotic.

They may. Again, possible, but not probable, not least since in the intervening period there would be absolutely nothing to stop someone with a grievance or just a desire for power to arm themselves, band together with others and assert a new monopoly of violence. You are also assuming that all current criticisms of anarcho-capitalism will go away once an ancap system is in place and nobody will ever want to get rid of it, which is clearly bollocks since we currently live in a world filled with governments and anarchists still exist.


Again, you're assuming that private institutions taking over all functions of living in exchange for profit with no regulations on them or mandated consequences for harming others is a state of affairs that will never be challenged by anyone and will never be opposed or overthrown. Privatisation of some government services is already a matter of severe public controversy and debate, the fact that this debate exists at all is just further proof that your idea that anarcho-capitalism will just be "the way things are" with nobody looking to get rid of it is hopelessly naive - again, not least since there would be no monopoly on violence to prevent someone from taking up arms *to* get rid of it.

That's a ridiculous argument. A monopoly refers to dominance within a **market sector**, not just a particular brand. In that sense the correct comparison for Coca-Cola would be in the soft drink market.


That also is a completely ridiculous comparison up until you get to the scale of, say, a town or city. Otherwise the McDonald's down the road could be considered to have a monopoly on that road.

Know your customer and AML screening is not, as another poster once suggested, a "gate" which one goes through and is then free to do whatever they please. KYC/AML is, and should be according to virtually all regulators, an *ongoing process* which takes into account what a customer says they're going to do, what they actually are doing, changes in their circumstances, changes in what transactions they process in volume or frequency, etc etc etc.
There are no rule changes here. Only their consistently applying a stringent policy on one of the highest AML risk products around.

In all fairness, it's a moronic statement. The "creators of Bitcoin" are not able to steal everyone's coins. The whole point of a decentralised currency is that that can't happen.
The Bitcoin community is, as you're well aware, massively up its own arse and has a tendency to fallaciously think that anyone who doesn't like Bitcoin doesn't understand it, which is wrong, but that doesn't mean that the people who *genuinely don't understand it* aren't wrong either.

I am saying that, much like Bitcoin through Coinbase, if Valve couldn't get dollars out of the other end of the process they wouldn't take Euro-denominated credit cards, and therefore nobody could rationally describe Valve taking those as a good thing for the Euro currency. Valve do not care about what currency they take because that is abstracted away from them; if they had to individually convert between Euros, pounds, Turkish lira, roubles, whatever into what they actually want (dollars) then that adds hassle to their process. The same applies to Bitcoin - taking pure Bitcoin is a mug's game, frankly, hence the existence of Coinbase, which does absolutely *nothing* for Bitcoin as a currency and in the final analysis just makes it an insanely expensive and computationally intensive way of moving dollars around, a problem that has already been solved quite adequately by any number of solutions and with numerous upsides over and above those minor ones offered by Bitcoin.
And the discussion has become one about whether using Coinbase to get USD is actually taking Bitcoin, my argument for which would be "no, it isn't".

That's weird. They're generally very popular all over Europe, and the rubrick to this report suggests so: 
It may be worth asking your bank to issue you one.


This is true on both counts. MasterCard are just the network underlying the cards, that process the actual transaction; it's the bank who are responsible for granting credit cards themselves. MasterCard have no input on that one.
It's also the case that no credit history means it's very hard to get credit. Even people who have lived in the UK all their lives, have a regular salary etc find it hard to get credit for the first time, because there's simply no data on how they might manage borrowing facilities. They usually build up a credit file by using what few sources they can get (usually mobile phone contracts or quite expensive credit cards) responsibly, and working up from there. It doesn't surprise me that someone fresh off the boat, so to speak, has trouble getting credit.


As you say, you shouldn't take it personally. It's actually quite prudent, given that (as noted above), you're new in the country, have no record of credit in the Netherlands at all, so they have no real knowledge of if you are a good or bad payer, or even if you have a regular job.


Give it a few months of your salary going through your account and go back again. They may be able to offer you credit when they've seen you manage your account well for a while, seen regular pay coming in, etc.


Like I say, I'd ask for a debit card in the meantime. I'm really surprised that you weren't offered one by your bank; after all, they save the bank money by issuing them...

Sorry, but that's complete shit. Regulation is not "too tight". The problem with Gox is that it wilfully didn't comply with the regulations that are in place, not that the regulations were there in the first place.
Regulation does not dissuade legitimate market entrants and reduce competition. It dissuades market entrants that intend to compete by undercutting others by cutting corners and putting consumers at risk and, in financial services in particular, dragging the whole market towards explicitly aiding organised crime.
Also, how is having an AML policy "hindering Bitcoin innovation"? What "innovations" are prevented by companies having to identify their customers, in line with everyone else in the financial services market? Please don't focus on my "drug money" comment, true as it is - I am personally against drug prohibition and would like there to be a legal regulated market for drugs, but the fact remains that selling illegal drugs is a crime, that the proceeds of this crime need to be laundered, and moreover is not the only source of funds that have to be laundered - I provided a whole list of others in my first reply.

No, because it's nonsensical and ignores reality in favour of praxis, much in the same way as Marxism does. Chicago school, even if I don't subscribe to it, is at least a reasonable way of empirically looking at things; Austrian school is balls to the wall fucknut mental.
Also, "monetarist" is not a theory of economics in the same way as Keynesianism or Chicago school are. It is view that variations in the money supply are central to economic success or failure, and that monetary policy is best focused in targeting money supply. It is quite compatible with Chicago school for instance, and the UK's Thatcher government essentially tried to blend it with Keynesianism (with mixed success).

So what you're saying is that, given that the same conduct would exist whether there was regulation or not - and it would, since if it hadn't existed in the first place then the regulation would have been pointless anyway - there should be no disincentive or punishment for engaging in it?


If you think that then you genuinely have absolutely no idea as to what money laundering is and why preventing it is a good thing for society at large.


Money laundering is concealing the proceeds of crime which can be, but is not limited to, drug dealing. I notice you focus on drug sales because they can be considered in a limited sense to be a victimless crime, but pretty much any crime which you can think of which results in someone obtaining money involves money laundering to a certain extent. My first comment in this thread provides several others:
* pimping and prostitution
* racketeering
* terrorist financing
* the sale of stolen goods
* murder for hire
None of which are particularly, in the final analysis, victimless crimes (with the possible exception of prostitution, but pimping definitely has victims.) Preventing money laundering makes these crimes harder - it means that the proceeds cannot be integrated into the wider economy, it means that organised crime cannot flourish or be at anything more than a minimal level of profitability without being noticed and without being prosecuted.
@_date: 2014-01-06 23:06:11

In a sense, it is. A lot of people wouldn't use it if they couldn't exchange X Bitcoin for Y dollars.
I'll readily admit this is a bit of a devil's advocate argument (it's technically wrong - I'm a stickler for being precise with language, and Bitcoin is no more "backed" by dollars than it is by pounds, yen, Euros or anything else someone cares to exchange Bitcoin for) but I would wager a lot of people do not want to earn Bitcoin for the sake of having Bitcoin, they want to earn Bitcoin because they want the regular currency Bitcoin can be converted into.
@_date: 2014-01-20 20:32:04
OK, maybe "Marry me" isn't a good enough comment.
But yeah. The whole anarcho-capitalist/libertarian circlejerk on here bothers me. As much as I'm a skeptic about Bitcoin, and don't think it will really go anywhere, there's nothing particularly offensive about it - I mean, the deflationary aspects are worrying, and there's nothing it can do that the average person can't already do in a way that doesn't cause them hassle (or causes them less hassle), but it doesn't actively *repulse* me. Overall it's a very cool, if significantly flawed, idea.
But it appears to have been blended so thoroughly with the ancap movement that it's taken that anyone questioning Bitcoin is also questioning anarcho-capitalism, and when politics gets dragged into what could otherwise be a rational discussion it pushes people out.
There's also the aspect of tax avoidance, the idea that Bitcoin solely exists to evade governments or render them useless. While that sort of thing sounds great to anarcho-capitalists, here's the thing - *it doesn't to everyone else*. Most people are happy with there being a government funded by taxation, or if not expressly "happy" they appreciate that it provides services to them. A great deal of people feel moral revulsion about people actively evading taxes. The heavy emphasis on ancap beliefs on here will turn them off and scare them off.
And before anyone says "Bitcoin isn't anarcho-capitalist", take a look in the sidebar. Bitcoin should be apolitical. Instead the sidebar is filled with links to subreddits about anarcho-capitalism, libertarianism and Austrian economics. They should not be there if you actually want Bitcoin to gain mass traction.

And the market cap of the entire New York Stock Exchange is $16.613TRILLION dollars. So Madoff made up 0.1% of the entire worth of all of the companies on all of the New York Stock Exchange. The entire GDP of the United States is not far off that, being about $17tn.
How much of the Bitcoin economy did Mt. Gox take with it? Well, Wikipedia says they lost 650,000 Bitcoins. [This site]( says there's 12,644,900 Bitcoins in existence. This means that Mt. Gox "lost" **over 5% of all of the Bitcoins in existence**.
For NYSE to have lost that much of its market cap, Exxon Mobil, Apple and Toyota would have to disappear all at once to destroy the $830,650,000,000 that would be wiped off it. (Rough figures, possibly outdated, but to prove a point.)

It's *a* way to troll.


I would invite you to look at my comment history to find "reasonable, adult comments", not all of which are overtly critical of Bitcoin - some actually argue against people criticising it. Speaking of this thread in particular, I personally don't see what exactly is wrong or "trollish" about pointing out that a lot of these proposed "solutions" are a significant step back in many different ways from what people already have with regular old cash, and that they all solve problems that either nobody has or which were caused by accepting Bitcoin in the first place. If merely expressing an opinion which is not 100% positive about Bitcoin, to the moon, currency of the future, perhaps in a "sardonic" way but overall in good faith and with reasoning, is "trolling" then by all means mark me down as a troll.
I'm not especially offended, since I've been called a troll about 9million times since registering this account, along with various other interesting epithets that don't apply (amongst them "economist in an ivory tower who doesn't work for a living", "PR agency drone" and, most slanderous of all, "American"). Merely perplexed.

That's something that often gets glossed over in these threads (along with the fact that chargebacks can be, and often are, defended against).

1. Since when was NASDAQ a regulator? NASDAQ is a stock exchange.
2. "All the Bitcoin on earth" is completely irrelevant. A correct proportionate estimate would involve all the *dollars* on earth, which according to the Fed there are 1.28tn of. Madoff's investors' actual losses are estimated at $18bn dollars, and this is the *largest financial fraud in history*. It's a piddling 1.4% of the entire US dollar monetary base. For Madoff to be on the scale of Mt.Gox he would have to have made actual losses of $72.9billion. He didn't. Your argument is absolute bunk.
3. TARP did not "take [money] from citizens to pay bonuses to failed bankers" and the only way you can truly think that is if you are totally ignorant about what TARP actually did. I saw this coming which is why I mentioned it in a paragraph in my grandparent post - TARP involved the US Treasury *purchasing assets from banks which it then held* in order to recapitalise banks and restabilise the financial system. Indeed, it may well lead to an actual net gain to the Treasury, since those assets purchased may increase in price (the same with quantitative easing). It is not anything like what you described, so I have to question exactly what your source of information is.

2. Receive Bitcoin, take Bitcoin to Australia. Hope the BTC/AUD exchange rate hasn't crashed in the meantime.
3. Use another unregulated currency exchange to send money to your bank account and incur a spread there, hope the bank don't get suspicious that a new customer just received a massive wire transfer in exchange for an unregulated, untraceable Internet currency.
4. OR, if that doesn't appeal, sell your Bitcoin for cash through LocalBitcoins, hope you don't get scammed by people turning up with fake cash or bags of Amazon gift vouchers, or just robbed for same; then figure out how to get $50,000 in cash into a bank account without looking like a drug dealer
1. Go to the bank, pay a 20 dollar fee and supply Australian bank details. Incur small exchange rate spread.
2. Australian bank receives money, is satisfied as to provenance of money because SWIFT message includes name of remitting customer and can see it is the same as their customer's name. OP drinks beer bought with filthy fiat.

How does this refute my point? As noted, there is an incentive to not offer escrow, and if nobody offers escrow then all options are the same? And even so, how does this prevent people being scammed if they don't know about escrow?


Or the consumers will think "fuck this Bitcoin shit" and just use a payment method that they get protection built into. Like it or not, people expect chargeback protection on their Internet purchases now, and Bitcoin is a significant step down.
A lot of arguments on here seem to focus around the idea that consumers en masse will use Bitcoin even if it is objectively worse for their purposes simply because they like the idea. This is one such argument, and it ignores the fact that most people just want to spend the normal money they have and couldn't care less about Bitcoin.


You take it back to WalMart and hope they comply with your legal rights. Which, yes, is the same as Bitcoin. The difference is that we were talking about **chargebacks on credit and debit cards**, which give significantly more rights to the consumer. Good attempt at moving the goalposts though.

The difference is that pounds aren't deflationary. Bitcoin is, over the very long term. At the moment it's so volatile that it can't be called either inflationary or deflationary, it's just something I don't want to touch because the value of what I can buy with it changes wildly day by day.

That's... not really true. At all. There's no "mess". Sure, my credit card and debit card and phone have different accounts connected to them, but all support contactless and I've never once had somewhere that takes contactless be unable to take any of them. The two big NFC payment schemes (MasterCard Paypass and Visa PayWave) are  both the same and both types of contactless card work everywhere, same as my phone (which uses the MasterCard kind).
Bitcoin NFC therefore is no more usable than the current debit/credit NFC, with other drawbacks (e.g. getting Bitcoin in the first place, the security of carrying around money on a mobile device that will never be reimbursed in the case of fraud).

Very possible *in theory*, but not going to happen in reality, considering that Bitcoin derivatives are rare as hen's teeth. That, and the sort of people who purchase options are, by and large, not going to be at all interested in buying a short in Bitcoin given its overall volatility.
What GHash *could* do is just straight up sell any Bitcoin assets they have, which would still guarantee them a large profit but also have the lovely side effect of porking the price of Bitcoin. Whether it would be possible to sell that much Bitcoin in the first place is another matter.


If your more frequent payouts totalled up over a period of say a year are more than you would get from mining alone over the same period, you would be a net winner. Clearly people see a benefit from mining as part of a massive pool, otherwise they wouldn't do it.

The way that this would be solved requires a number of things to change. But there is a key issue: it requires the supply chain of the retailer to be priced in Bitcoins.
The reason BitcoinStore really wants dollars is because it buys the cameras in dollars, it pays its rent in dollars, it pays its staff in dollars, and none of those are possible at present. To sell stuff in Bitcoin and only think in Bitcoin their suppliers would have to price in Bitcoin, their landlord or whoever would have to accept Bitcoin and their staff would have to be paid in Bitcoin. But then we go to the next level: the suppliers would want dollars *too*, so they use a service like Bitpay and still "think" in dollars, making the whole point moot; the landlord has to pay their mortgage in dollars (or just wants to spend stuff in dollars) so they'll be thinking in dollars; the employee is probably the most crucial, because they will have their own range of outgoings and they will ALL want dollars - water bills, electric bills, grocery bills. It is, to put it one way, dollars all the way down.
My point here is that currencies have a HUGE network effect. There is nothing really to be gained for most businesses by stepping outside the dollar "network" and a whole host of benefits kept by staying in. Unless the ENTIRE economy switched to Bitcoin - rents could be paid in it, mortgages could be paid in it, energy bills could be paid in it, groceries could be bought with it - at some point, someone will not be thinking "this costs 1BTC" but will instead be thinking "this costs $X, so therefore I need to sell it for Y in Bitcoin to make that up". It could well be that BitcoinStore is exploiting this, able to charge silly prices because there's very little competition at this point and therefore they have a captive market (i.e. "true believers" in the Bitcoin technology). They would, clearly, make a handsome profit, even if all they did was order the product from Amazon when someone pays them for the product.
This is the key issue with Bitcoin adoption - at present, when used as a currency (and not a commodity, like it is a lot) all it is is a roundabout and volatile way of using recognised national currencies. The other is that the average person has absolutely no beef with using normal currency, and Bitcoin solves no problems for them while introducing new ones that they wouldn't want to deal with.

Not to mention, it's a huge part of any use of money. This sort of thing basically renders any sort of e-commerce through Bitcoin totally vulnerable to attack in a way cards and PayPal are not.
Essentially you are relying on a random-looking string of numbers and letters which you have no real means of verifying to be the shop/person you're intending to send money to, and not some other random asshole looking to skim off the transaction. This is an entirely different thing from, say, harvesting a credit card number - credit cards can be cancelled and charges reversed, you send your money to some Bitcoin address or another and it's gone for good.

What does that change? It doesn't matter how many parties there are to a transaction - if one of them fucks me over then I'm still getting fucked over. Nice words about "no third parties" ignore that the "third party" when you use a credit or debit card provides protection to both the consumer and the merchant - the merchant a guarantee that they'll get their money, the customer that they have recourse if they don't get what they paid for. Bitcoin, even with escrow, substantially unbalances that in favour of the merchant.

Currently though there are printers that can be bought for both. So the question isn't irrelevant at all; it's why I should buy the same printer for Bitcoin instead of buying it for pounds.


I can use my debit card for an unlimited amount, I can lift as much cash as I want so long as I can prove who I am and the bank has the physical cash in store and I can assure you that the £6,000 limit you suggest simply does not exist. FYI, the FSA does not exist either any more, its functions were split between the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority early last year, and in any event suspicious activity reports are not sent to either the FSA, PRA or FCA, they are sent to a subsidiary of the Ministry of Justice which used to be SOCA but the name of which escapes me at the moment, I will look it up shortly (EDIT: National Crime Agency). Either way, you are demonstrably wrong.

Say there are 21million Bitcoin in circulation, for the sake of argument, and that this is further indivisible (again, for the sake of argument, and because I can't be bothered dealing with quadrillions).

Making cash illegal is an absurd restriction which, quite frankly, most regular people would not stand for - a prime case of baby being thrown out with bathwater, and something that makes even less sense than banning Bitcoin outright. Licensing tumbler companies as money service businesses however is an excellent idea, given their usefulness for laundering.

Because the one thing that Bitcoin needed was to be further politicised with more things most people are against.
Even leaving aside the fact that if you want Bitcoin to gain mass adoption tagging right wing political viewpoints along with it is perhaps even more idiotic than the anarcho-capitalist bollocks it's currently lumbered with, the FairTax is not fair in any sense other than "everyone pays the same percentage". It is regressive, i.e. affects those least able to pay it the most, since those on lower incomes spend a higher percentage of their incomes on goods.

I'll be honest... I didn't see that one coming. And it is a genuinely impressive move for Bitcoin. The large Bitcoin sign ups that have happened before have either been also rans like Overstock or pisspoor companies like Tiger Direct or Dish Network. Dell is incredibly unexpectedly huge.
But that still does not validate Bitcoin as a payment method or as a currency. Acceptance is just one piece of the puzzle; the intrinsic issues with Bitcoin still remain - it is still economically brain dead, it still relies on the goodwill of anonymous people you have no recourse against to process all transactions, it still provides no recourse for consumers against merchants who screw them, and there are still no coherent non-ideological reasons for someone to buy it to spend with over using the money they already have. So is right to be excited, because in all fairness to you guys this is a big big move for Bitcoin, but you should not lose sight of the fact that as a payment method and currency intrinsically Bitcoin still has a long way to go, and Dell's acceptance will likely not help that.

You're an idiot. Seriously. You can keep your YouTube videos, if they somehow make someone think "banks being uncertain about the creditworthiness of other banks" is caused by "private banks creating money as credit out of thin air" I don't want them. The causes of the crisis had absolutely nothing to do with that, no matter how much it would suit your narrative and ideology.
And yes, banks increase the money supply. So what? It's a good thing, and even if it wasn't it still had nothing to do with the credit crisis as you claim, something you are factually wrong on, much like your reasoning for why it was called the "credit crisis".
For the second time: stop being a retard and actually read up on some finance and economics that doesn't come from Mises.org, ZeroHedge or YouTube videos.

Stop you right there. Seriously, the rest of your comment is totally irrelevant because this is so batshit bonkers.
The land, as noted, was owned by the US government. He had a contract with the landowner to pay them in exchange for being able to ranch his cattle on the land. He didn't pay but kept his cows there. He breached the contract. (We'll leave aside the bit about how that government has had an incredible amount of patience here, twenty years is an insanely long time.)
So either all breaches of contract are now victimless, or you make a special exception for contracts with any entity that happens to be a government because they are a government. Which is it? And how would this play out any differently in a situation where, say, a private landowner owns the land that Cliven Bundy's cattle were squatting on?
Either way it's still fucking stupid reasoning. My tenancy with my landlord is much the same - I pay them in exchange for having an apartment to live in. If I live in the apartment while not paying the rent, I have breached my contract with them. That me being homeless makes me economically less active, that the letting agent has missed out on income etc etc etc doesn't factor into it. *I breached the contract. It is my fault. The landlord has a right to enforce it.*
So you know what? Bundy was the aggressor. He signed up to a contract and didn't hold his end of the bargain, while the victim here showed an incredible amount of forebearance way beyond anything any private organisation would tolerate. It takes an absolutely absurd and instinctive hatred of the US government that suppresses all reasonable thought, not to mention a complete failure to understand what a contract is, in order to think otherwise.

Read the link I posted. 2.1quadrillion Satoshis (using your numbers) are all there will ever be. At least 2.66trillion have been irretrievably lost. And a satoshi is the *smallest possible division of a Bitcoin*, so we are at that point not comparing it to a dollar or a pound, we're comparing it to the most granular division of a current currency, a penny. Meaning that to do a proper one to one comparison, you would have to have an economy of  2,097,400,000,000,000 *pennies*, or 20 trillion dollars, roughly, to maintain the same sort of granularity and divisibility we currently have. Think I'm being disingenuous there? OK then - what you're arguing is that Bitcoin should appreciate to an *even more* insane level than what this would require.
And guess what? The GDP of the *world* is about 72trillion dollars. The GDP of the US is about 16 trillion. The worldwide adoption of Bitcoin would represent a ridiculously large contraction in the money supply which would basically kneecap the world economy - a growing economy needs an expanding money supply. A fixed money supply just hobbles an economy. This is settled economic consensus and has been for decades, and is borne out by real world experience. How would Bitcoin somehow get around this?

@_date: 2014-06-08 16:41:06


America is going over to chip and PIN very soon now, from what I understand. As for NFC, that's a very real thing - I used my phone to pay for stuff just the other day, and I use my contactless card regularly since there's quite a few places around me (in the UK) that take it. NFC is *already* bigger and has more market penetration, both on the merchant and consumer side, than Bitcoin.
Part of the issue is that in the UK, as you probably know, we have a very mature and very efficient banking infrastructure with no transactional fees for personal customers, instant (or near-instant) payments between bank accounts also free of any charge, pretty much every merchant at the very least accepting Chip and PIN, with contactless slowly but surely catching up, and strong regulatory protections for consumers, including in the event of fraud and theft. Bitcoin costs consumers money in fees with damn near every payment, can be slower than the competing technology that already exists, has relatively few merchants taking it (as you found out) and has absolutely no protection against fraud, theft or merchants scamming customers. In that light, over here Bitcoin is a solution looking for a problem and doesn't look at all attractive to consumers (perhaps marginally more so in the US, whose banking infrastructure is pisspoor and where transactions are chargeable, but still clearly not enough to overcome the network effects of cards and dollars).

Entirely true, but then those people aren't mentioned in the infographic, so what's your point?
@_date: 2014-01-20 20:56:06
Those people were never going to use Bitcoin anyway. 
You need to realise something that a lot of people on here fail to see; outside of the echo chamber, *people who are interested in Bitcoin are a minority*. Most people - normal, average people, not geeks or whatever - view it as either a ridiculous idea or an amusing sideshow, an "and finally..." story on the news when some idiot chucks away a hard drive with millions of them on. They were never going to try it anyway. Most people are not. Banks aren't scared of it, they simply don't care (or wish to not expose themselves to the risks accompanying of it.) The Fed aren't scared of it, they just don't care because it's small fry overrun by kooks who were never going to be on their side anyway. The Bitcoin community has a very, very overinflated sense of its own standing.
Dogecoin utterly skewers that. Dogecoin is what those people outside the echo chamber see Bitcoin as - ridiculous, easily generated fun money for Internet people to play around with, but with no serious purpose and no real utility. It's the little kid screaming that the emperor has his bollocks hanging out. Once you grasp that the whole thing falls into place, and you can see why Bitcoin faces such an uphill battle for adoption. Dogecoin isn't going to stop people from adopting Bitcoin, Dogecoin shows Bitcoiners WHY people aren't adopting Bitcoin.

It looks like everybody here is looking to solve problems nobody has by making everything a lot harder for everyone concerned.
Here's what happens when I go to a bar. I give the bartender dirty filthy statist money and receive change and a drink. It takes at most 30 seconds including the time to pour the drink, and requires no training or development costs on anyone's part, assuming that the bartender can count. If I want to pay on card, that takes maybe an extra 10 seconds, or if the bar accepts contactless cards shrink that down to 5 seconds.
Your solution, and many of others on this thread, introduce so much needless complexity to a simple transaction that it's hilarious.
@_date: 2014-01-07 18:07:19


I don't, because it offers me convenience, and again most people don't care for the same reason. In any event, the costs of accepting Bitcoin will also be rolled into the price I pay, so even if I considered it a problem, Bitcoin still wouldn't change anything.


Unfortunately, intelligent businesses also know that if they can scam people without any means of recourse then they can make more profit than legitimate businesses.


So why are you waxing lyrical about how much better Bitcoin is and how significant issues with it are actually good points?


I'm not sure how your argument that people will simply learn from their mistake of not using escrow makes any sense unless these people care so much about using Bitcoin they don't care they got scammed.


No, not exactly, since...


No, we were talking about chargebacks on **purchases made with credit and debit cards**, and therefore your "but what about cash" was a poor attempt to change the subject. And so was this.


Unfortunately the option most people already have and want, i.e. chargebacks, is not present and will not be present given Bitcoin's decentralised architecture.

It's a real risk, but what you've described is simply "too big to fail" in microcosm. It's the nature of an economy that everything is interdependent and that the failure of a large financial institution would deal quite possibly a knockout blow. The problems with Bitcoin in this scenario though are twofold:
1. There's no TARP or bailout or QE that could be enacted to stop the whole economy from sliding into the shitter should this happen; and
2. Pretty much all the "too big to fail" market entities which hold large numbers of Bitcoins are incompetent in one way or another due to the lack of regulations or barriers to entry to stop any clown shoes idiot from deciding they'll be the first of the next Mellon dynasty.

I love how Bitcoin is a payment system when it's convenient for Bitcoiners ("It'll replace Visa and have no fees!"), but then a currency when it's convenient for Bitcoiners ("It's just a currency, there's no chargeback with cash is there?").

We've had payment as frictionless or more frictionless as Bitcoin (inasmuch as Bitcoin is frictionless, my most recent experience with it was anything but and in fact pissed me off a lot) for years. It's called PayPal. Donations won't suddenly become more profitable if Bitcoin takes off, you still have to get over users' mental aversion towards paying for content.
There is a glut of free content available. Users will tend to gravitate towards that rather than go through a paywall, frictionless or no, because a small amount of money is still infinitely more than the free content makers are asking for.

Actually pretty much forever. Network effects are a strong thing - everyone takes normal money, everyone gets paid in normal money and there's nothing so obviously wrong with normal money to justify changing over to Bitcoin, so people largely won't.

Nationwide (as I'm sure you know) is a building society, not a bank. Building society branches are often physically small so can't/don't keep much cash on hand, and they don't service business customers so don't get bulk cash paid in like banks have. They set daily withdrawal limits and ask for prearrangement for larger sums to avoid their being completely wiped out of cash for the rest of the day if one guy turns up and wants thousands of pounds.

What's your point? If it's to argue against saying that Bitcoin is largely shit for the task of spending money, I believe they meant it in an economic sense, and that's entirely true - Bitcoin's value is so volatile at present and its usefulness so pegged to merchants being able to convert it to normal currency (and therefore the exchange rate between Bitcoin and that normal currency) you would have to be crazy to try and use it for day to day spending, as the value is simply that unstable.

Mt Gox isn't involved in fractional reserve, since they aren't lending out money based on their deposits or anything of the kind. They're just extremely illiquid and have to ration USD withdrawals as a result.

@_date: 2014-01-08 18:09:50


No. It isn't. A bank run is a result of banks loaning out more money than they have in reserves, and more depositors showing up to withdraw funds than they have in those reserves at that point. Unless you consider fractional reserve banking (i.e. the basis of the modern world economy) to be "malicious" your comment is complete horseshit.

That's a *minimum* of 0.2%. For any amount over that, or to any other country, it's £25. I'll leave those percentages as an exercise for... actually, no I won't - for a £2000 payment that'd be 1.2%, and the percentage goes down as the payment size goes up.)

It depends how you define human labour. If I buy a share in YourMother'sCunt Inc. for $5 and sell it for $100, making $95 capital gains, I'd consider that to be legitimate income, but the actual "labour" involved is tiny (moving my mouse to click a button?)

You wanted me to source my statement that an anarcho-capitalist system being put in place would come at great cost to pretty much everyone. My response to which was the post above, that it is quite self-evident that completely changing an entity to remove the governing and protecting body of that entity will cause a period of upheaval and result in instability which will come at the cost of lives and productivity, and that there are no direct sources for this other than the experience of damn near every single overthrow of a political system ever. That's not a strawman.
I have debated in good faith with other people, in fact take a look at this quite detailed and thorough comment I've written [here]( which, surprise surprise, got ignored. You just demand sources for things that have no sources because they are completely and utterly self-evident, and then call it a strawman when I reply with such. Oh, and use the "statist" snarl word, which to be quite frank just makes you look like a self-righteous prick to anyone who isn't a libertarian of some description.
Also the structure of society is not government, that's just meaningless. And I'm still not seeing any sources as to how anarcho-capitalism would *definitely* be better in any tangible way.

But proof of participation in a contract does not guarantee fulfilment of that contract or that the other participant in the contract can actually fulfil the contract. If anyone can create a coloured coin saying they had 1oz of gold, say, then people could end up trading these coloured coins without there actually being the commodity there to back it up.
Say I make a contract with you now to sell you 100 shares in Berkshire Hathaway, sure you can enforce that through the courts if I don't give you your shares, there's a contract in ink that says I owe you them. If traded on an exchange, the central counterparty (yes! GASP, centralisation is a good thing sometimes) guarantees that the trade will go through without a hitch and it shouldn't even get that far. Now try doing it when the only proof of participation in a contract is through one of these pseudonymous coloured coins (and, frankly, I don't want any element of a contract I enter into to be pseudonymous, let alone anonymous, because I'd want to know who to enforce it against should need be) that I sent you that supposedly represent 100 shares in Berkshire Hathaway that I may or may not own, and that may or may not actually represent a legally enforceable contract. You would be left with a digital token that represents your ownership rights in something that might not actually exist. Good luck, basically.

But the scenario in the OP, quite frankly, assumes that we live in the reality that we currently live in, where new printers that are only sold for Bitcoin simply do not exist.


The scenario is me, in the UK. I can use my debit card and my money without restriction. My situation is not uncommon.


OP doesn't have Bitcoin. The question is "why should I make a purchase with Bitcoin when I have pounds".


I don't have a desire to do so, and I'm working on a pragmatic benefit as to what brings direct benefit to *me*. Not putative future amazingness. I am talking "me" as in an average person with pounds and a debit card wanting to buy a printer to be delivered to him. Not a Bitcoiner or someone with a vested interest in it.

The two are not mutually exclusive.

It involves, and has always involved, people who wish to get power seeking it through means available to them, including violence. How is this created by government and how do you propose to remove it in a proposed anarcho-capitalist society?


Actually it pretty much *is* anarchy, being the lack of existence of a government. And it would create a period of chaos in which there would be a lot of bloodshed and suffering for no real gain to anyone, which is why we're not doing it.


And this is bollocks. It is not a "religion" to think that a country is better off with a government to administer and protect it, it is a political position as valid as any other.


Well you're not going to get an ancap society *without* a violent revolution, and I'd be intrigued to hear how you would replace one of the most powerful, wealthy, strongly supported and well armed entities on the planet without some sort of violent revolution. But if you did, you would hit upon the same issues the Communists did after the Russian revolution. Marxism's ideological end game is, much like anarcho-capitalism, stateless anarchy, but in the Russian revolution a group of self-appointed people had taken power to deliver this anarchy. This is, clearly, an oxymoron, which is why that never worked out (nor could it, really, for the same reasons an ancap society isn't going to happen.) But without that "vanguard", what would have been left is a power vacuum, and after that we don't have "anarchy", we have the guys with the pointiest sticks having de facto power.


It would have to be a significant culture change given that most people (regardless of political alignment) are quite vocally in support of, if not the actual government that is in place or the people who are in that government being in charge of it, there being a government at all of some size. Anarcho-capitalists, much like Marxists, are very much in the minority because their ideas are completely unworkable unless you take a view of human nature so positive and optimistic that it borders on the insanely deluded.


I have to ask. How are *you specifically* *not* free? I will hazard a guess that you are in the United States, or at the very least in one Western nation. What specific freedoms are being withheld from you, that impact on your daily life in a significant manner, that would a) only be returned to you through the abolition of any government and b) not conceivably be withheld from you also under an anarcho-capitalist system?


Agorism's only chance of actual success is if you manage to convince the majority of a society to adhere to it in order to achieve your goals and starve the government you wish to remove of income. This is, frankly, a pipedream. It's a *possibility*, sure, but it is an extremely slim possibility.
To reach my next point we have to step through a few things first. The state and federal governments of the United States own the land in the USA (for the sake of argument; the same applies to other nations too, the principle is that the government ultimately owns the land). As part of an implicit contract, the government wishes to be paid a fee (taxes) in order for you to reside upon that land, and should you not pay that fee it will attempt to collect through a variety of methods, ranging from court summons up to removing your freedom and, yes, using violence against you. Note that all of this is entirely possible and permissible under an ancap system also - a landowner owns the land, can charge you for residing in this land, can enforce punishment against you for residing on the land without paying (although it must be said much more bluntly than the US federal government does; "get off my land" and then a countdown until you get some buckshot in the face is not noted as one of the IRS' enforcement methods). The US just takes this to a larger scale (with some variations in structure, it being a federation, but the principle remains the same).
So, all this being true; if agorism *does* somehow manage to reach a sizeable enough amount of popularity (through some miracle, given that, again, anarchist movements are *incredibly* unpopular) would this not just entail increasingly draconian investigations into, and punishments for, those evading taxation or engaging in the black market, as opposed to "oh well I guess we'd better just go quietly then".


But people *don't* choose anarchy. Overwhelmingly they *like* the existence of government and government institutions, even with the culture in a lot of countries sliding more to the right over the past few decades. In fact, the people have *never* chosen anarchy - where they have overthrown their governments before, they have always been replaced with another government, not an absence of one.
And what you think will happen is based upon a lot of assumptions, chiefly that other institutions will somehow spring up to do the functions of former state services in the absence of any requirement to do so. A lot of the things governments do are things which it does precisely *because* nobody else will do them (e.g. social welfare, which simply cannot be replaced by charity as some anarcho-capitalists - and even just plain old conservatives - suggest, without impoverishing a lot of people and destabilising society as a result).


There is a *reason* that there have never been anarcho-capitalistic societies, and it's *because* living under them sucks. It's quite easy to see that living under one would suck if you give it some actual thought and know anything about the behaviour of people. I do not ask for empirical evidence that putting my dick in a salami slicer will hurt - I just think about the consequences of sharp blades meeting my penis and don't do it.


It does however suggest that that thing forming naturally of its own accord without significant manipulation is not very likely.


Well, it's not my logic, but regardless, you are confusing someone specifically programming a decentralised, digital currency through their active effort to make something that has never been made before, and the expectation completely without evidence, and completely contrary to all of recorded history, that people in the absence of any direction to the contrary will live freely side by side with each other and not attempt to take power for themselves, which has not happened before because it is exceptionally unlikely.


You are expecting people en masse to use a currency which is currently a tiny blip on most peoples' radars and that does nothing special that most of the millions of people who you would need to sway to have achieved your goal actually care about and, by your reckoning, aims to bring about an end that a vast majority of them do not support. Not only that but you aim to do so not only going against the current society's most basic predominant political view (that there should be a government), but also the network effect that state currencies currently enjoy, and the basic fact that (as noted above) the government has a right to levy a charge for living on the land it owns and that it has not only a de jure but also de facto monopoly on violence which allows it to enforce collection of this charge.
To put it mildly, this view is hopelessly naive. Again, possible, but not even remotely probable.


By their nature, probably not. Whether they actually gain any kind of market traction is a different matter.

Probably because the UK already has an extremely well-developed, efficient and mostly free banking system.

Silk Road operated an escrow system, yes. Unfortunately actual proper escrow agencies working with actual money have to be licensed and able to pick out individual client's monies from a pool, and are largely not knowingly dealing in illegal goods. So "unclean hands" comes into play and the regulations on handling client assets don't, because Silk Road was flouting them.
(These regulations, incidentally, are why if you find an escrow site for normal money to Bitcoin, they won't do anything on the "fiat" side of the transaction, only the Bitcoin side - since they have to be licensed to handle dollars or whatever, but not Bitcoin.)

The basic reason is that the Bitcoin financial market - its "banks", exchanges, markets like MPEX - is essentially one big cargo cult, trying to build a crude facsimile of the markets the real world has in the hope that they will attract the same riches.

Quite possibly, but being the "most regulated" of a bunch of companies in a community almost pathologically opposed to the concept of regulation is not exactly something to be proud of. Begrudgingly carrying out AML duties (often in a lax and substandard way) does not in any way compare to actual regulations which proper financial businesses adhere to. You say "verify the identity of every single user" like it's not a) a legal requirement for all firms and b) an unnecessary hassle, which betrays a lack of understanding of regulation on the first point and a catastrophic lack of understanding of the nature of financial crime on the second.

Do we now? This ignores that merchants have to pay for supplies in normal currency, and doing so introduces exchange fees and rate spread, not to mention no certainty that the amount of Bitcoin received will be able to cover the amount of dollars or whatever they laid out for the goods they sell.
Arguments like this ignore the fact that just having "no fees!!!!" or "low fees!!!!" are not the be all and end all and that there are other costs to accepting Bitcoin other than the transaction fees, especially if your company has to interact with the wider economy in some way.


Yes but how much extra *profit* would be made by Amazon? How many more sales would they get from Bitcoin? I would wager not enough to make the (putative) 2% savings worth it. Just Amazon accepting Bitcoin wouldn't make people go out and switch to it because most people simply don't care. Most people are happy with dollars, pounds and Euros.


How marvellous for Amazon. I'm a consumer - I like chargebacks. People will be resistant to using any payment method without them, especially as soon as the first (well, OK, eleventy billionth) story of "I paid for this stuff with Bitcoin and the guy didn't ship it and I've been screwed over" comes out in the media. This further reduces the potential Bitcoin market share, and therefore the reasons Amazon would take it.


Or they could pocket the difference as profit, or there could be no difference at all, as noted above.
There is also the fact that with that "discount" it requires lots of jumping through hoops and involves the consumer giving up lots of rights that they would otherwise have had if they'd just paid on their credit or debit card.

I really love these assertions.
For the umpteenth time - it is possible to have studied Bitcoin, to know how it works, to be inquisitive about it, to not dismiss it straight off the bat, and yet after all of that *still not think it's very good*. Most of the people on are not ignorant about Bitcoin, they actually know plenty about it.
@_date: 2014-04-25 21:17:34


* A severe lack of objective benefits and flexibility for end consumers over already extant payment methods and currencies; any uses where Bitcoin might have an edge are niche
* Severe deficiencies in the network's design which makes it impractical for use in any real world setting (e.g. scalability, a hard limit of 7 transactions per second when Visa alone can process tens of thousands without breaking a sweat)
* The complete inefficiency of having the whole thing being decentralised, as well as the possibility that the security of the network could be compromised by a big enough miner cartel acting in concert (with the only real argument against the possibility of them doing so being "they wouldn't because they like Bitcoin")
* A potentially fragile economy with no lender of last resort, which would make serious entrants into the market overly cautious and those who are *not* overly cautious or who suffer bad luck at a severe risk of taking the rest of the economy down with them
To name but a few.

Nobody's telling you you have to, you're not obliged to. If you want to use Bitcoin or cash then go for it. Equally, merchants are not obliged to accept Bitcoin because they may feel the protection they get in having a third party in between is valuable.
Incidentally, there is no "price" to me for using a debit card. It's free.


I do, but here's the thing - nobody is obliged to use escrow. And there is an incentive for merchants to not offer it, since if no escrow is used then the customer has no right to dispute the purchase, and therefore the merchant can keep the customer's money. The mere presence of the escrow feature doesn't enforce it being used.
There's also a significant difference between escrow and chargeback - time. Escrow is only possible at the start of a transaction. A chargeback can be undertaken within a few months of it. This is fine for digital goods, where you can confirm receipt and all is well, but it breaks down for physical goods where a fault could only become apparent weeks or months after you buy them. If the merchant is non-cooperative and you paid on a credit or debit card, you can use chargeback; if you paid with Bitcoin, you can either go to court or eat shit.
Meanwhile if you use a credit card or debit card the merchant has to respond to chargebacks, whether they want to or not, as part of their merchant services contract. Indeed, on credit cards in this country there's a legal right to this which would not apply to Bitcoin.

I like my non-trust free recurring payments. Direct Debits let me pay all my bills with no need to do anything other than agree to have them set up, and a no-quibble dispute mechanism which guarantees a same-day refund should something go wrong. Using your system is not only functionally equivalent to me setting up standing orders to pay all my bills, something which requires more admin work and hassle on my part, it's also a significant step down from what I already have.

Yes it is. If Wells Fargo or HSBC or JP Morgan went to the wall in the same way Mt. Gox did (which they wouldn't, because they're competent, but that's by the by) then you would see something very, very cataclysmic happen that would make Gox's collapse look like a fart in a lift, but it still wouldn't be counterparty risk unless you were *directly* one of Wells Fargo or HSBC or JP Morgan's customers and they then defaulted on their obligations to you - i.e. they were a counterparty. Otherwise your risks from them are indirect, e.g. the market plunging into the shitter.
Don't get me wrong; Mt. Gox was fucking stupid, being as it was part of the enormous cargo cult that is the Bitcoin "economy", a completely unregulated shitheap that was bound to collapse and take a lot of peoples' money/funbux with it. But unless you were actually a counterparty of Gox, you haven't got any counterparty risk.

That regulation post yesterday made me cringe. He obviously knows what regulations there are, but he clearly left out the explanations of what they were for and what misconduct they were intended to prevent, because if he did rationally explain them then they might be seen as defensible, and that wasn't the point. The point was to say "see?! Look at all that silly shit! We have to comply with *at least* twenty rules! Bitcoin to the moon!"
Considering all the crying about "shills" on a regulated financial adviser posting on here about how he should have fewer regulations (and therefore save more money and not be restricted from behaving in unethical or irresponsible ways in order to make more money) is laughable.

The real question is whether mobile wallets of any kind (Bitcoin or otherwise) will ever have any uptake beyond niche usage. They've existed for a while here in the UK and they've not set the world on fire. 
What will be interesting is that there's a new service just launching soon called Zapp which is backed by the major banks and works, in a UX sense, much like Bitcoin does (i.e scan a QR code to send money to someone). It'll be interesting to see if that works out, as it will have name brand recognition, won't have fees, won't have delays, will have fraud protection - all things Bitcoin doesn't have (fees for Bitcoin being exchange spread), while working in the same way Bitcoin does. If Apple launch their own wallet, that will likely be much the same. If they get any traction, then Bitcoin will be frankly DOA, since there is no reason for the average person to use it over services that work in precisely the same way with money they already have.
Personally though I don't think Apple would release a wallet. It strikes me as something they'd have an uphill battle to get shops to take and a poor fit for their existing business.

No, but it also sounds far fetched.

Erm, no, debit cards charge a flat fee of around £0.40. Always have done. Even assuming I'm buying a £40 printer that works out at 1% fee.


Not really, because given that it's a flat fee (and a flat fee much smaller in percentage terms than the one you posit) that doesn't work out.


Or the merchant would pocket the difference, which is what seems to happen whenever operational costs get lower (e.g. when VAT was briefly reduced by 2.5% in the UK, smaller shops often just kept prices the level they were and didn't pass on the VAT savings, hoping people didn't notice).

Very much this. The entire world economy is at this point dependent in some way on the US dollar, being as it is a very stable currency in which many different commodities are denominated. If the dollar or the institutions surrounding it were suddenly to collapse, Bitcoin will not help you. Guns, clean water and food, on the other hand...
(This is not to give credibility to the survivalist nuts stocking up on tinned beans and ammo in preparation for the coming econopocalypse, since even the rug being pulled out from under everyone's feet as in 2008 didn't fuck things up that badly, but they do however have a much better handle on what will fly after such a thing happens than those who think that a non-tangible commodity wholly reliant on the existence of electricity and high speed telecommunications links to even have its value and existence ascertained, not to mention that only works at all if other people burn natural resources to sustain its existence, will possibly be at all useful in a scenario where the entire world economy has fallen apart.)
@_date: 2014-02-09 15:15:53


That isn't a certainty, as I said in the post. What if the merchant just absorbs the cost of chargebacks (which, incidentally, are actually rather rare) or card processing rather than pricing them in to products? Or what if they do but they charge the same price (as a conversion from GBP&gt;Bitcoin) in either currency? Either way there is no direct benefit? It's *possible* but it's entirely speculative. Indeed, somewhere like BitcoinStore has been noted to charge *more* (as a conversion from normal money) than it would to just buy the goods from Amazon or wherever.


But that doesn't relate to the scenario I posted. Regardless, I can pay for all of those things with my debit card, and paying with Bitcoin doesn't mean people won't spam me.


Your credit card company likely rang you up to ensure it wasn't someone else using your card fraudulently. If it was then they would have refunded you. Most people would consider that a good thing.

If you've been in overdraft for 2 years and not paid any of it back then yes you will pay more interest. That is how it works.
The APR rate does not reach Wonga. If you've paid £130 for a year's overdraft on £500 the annual percentage rate, by definition, is 26% a year. I will hazard a guess it is not that, but you are with Natwest/RBS who charge a flat £6 a month fee plus interest which will be somewhere between 17 and 20%. Wonga's APR is in quadruple digits. Even being as generous as possible to your argument, you are talking shit.
I would respectfully suggest that if you are upset about paying interest on money you have borrowed that you pay back the money that you have borrowed and you do not borrow any more money, being as paying interest on money borrowed is how borrowing money works. Again - why should you not have to pay for borrowing someone else's money?

In which case he's lying because *no banks in the UK charge a fee of £13 a month to have an arranged overdraft.* In fact, only two charge a fee for having an arranged overdraft at all, RBS/Natwest and Lloyds, the fees for which are £6 and £5 respectively, and both only apply if you actually use the facility. Halifax and Santander both levy daily charges for overdraft usage (£1 and 50p respectively, regardless of the amount) but these fees are not only remarkably clear and simple but are again easily avoided by not borrowing money.

Milton Friedman actually proposed modifications to Keynesian economic thought in the 1970s that Keynesians accepted. He also proposed some things which are damn near socialism (e.g. negative income tax) and was quite happy for there to be government monopolies so long as they could be freely competed against.
The Nobel prize isn't a means of honouring who the Nobel committee thinks is *right*, it's a means of honouring who they think has made the greatest *contribution*. Milton Friedman was extremely intelligent and an excellent economist. So is Paul Krugman. Both deserve their prizes.

Those things are only "good for Bitcoin" in the heads of libertarians/ancaps who were paranoid about those things anyway and see Bitcoin as a weapon against them.

Because people, by and large, do not always act rationally. People en masse tend to favour a short term profit even when it may cause long term cost (e.g. while you'd make more profit dumping toxic waste in a river rather than disposing of it properly, do it on a consistent basis and you'll get poisoned by the polluted river).


That's not quite the way it's meant. It's not that if there's deflation businesses wouldn't pay their workers, not least because that's illegal as you say. It's more that there's little to no incentive to hire people and expand your business to make more money with extra risk if you can make just as much extra money risk free by sitting on it. It's not so much the physically paying people who are employed by you that's the issue, more whether it makes sense to employ those people in the first place.
While on a small scale, for that business owner, it makes sense, but in a wider scale it's terrible - there's fewer employed people, so fewer people with money to spend, less money floating around the wider economy because of that, businesses go bust, their employees become unemployed, etc etc etc.


Obviously even in a deflationary economy people would spend money. But if after paying your bills you could buy a widget for $1 now, but if you sat on the money you could in a few months buy two widgets for the same dollar, you'd be foolish not to put those purchases off. This means, speaking in wider terms, fewer people spending money, less money going into businesses, etc etc etc.
This scenario is already being played out with Bitcoin. Most of the transactions on the Bitcoin network right now are not goods and services being purchased - they are Bitcoins being bought and sold for their speculative value.
The opposite scenario is inflation. While this does mean that, yes, your currency is worth slightly less each year, it also means that there is a stimulus to invest that money in productive or economically beneficial ways (e.g. in stocks or other investments, in starting a business, in lending it out with interest etc), since just sitting on it effectively costs you money.
One other thing to note is that while "inflation" can mean an increase in the money supply (which is effectively the base of the ideology of monetarism) it does specifically mean an increase in prices across an economy. So money supply can be a cause, but it's not the main cause. Deflation is the inverse - a decrease in the money supply could cause it, or it could be prices going down for another reason.
@_date: 2014-06-21 22:07:31
So basically if you outright ignore all the negative effects of deflation but focus on the relatively minor positive side of it then it sounds good.

In short, spending the same Bitcoin(s) twice because the network hasn't cottoned on that they're already spent.

This damages the integrity of the blockchain.

I'll never forget the time my mother died. I was in a hospital, surrounded by beeping machines and her connected to them by tubes and wires, watching her breathing slow down as she faded from existence, until finally she stopped and the machines replaced their steady beeping with one long, final tone, signifying the death of the woman who had created me, brought me up and made me who I was, and was always there for me.

There are three stages to money laundering:
* Placement - the funds are placed into the financial system
* Layering - the funds are moved around using different methods to obfuscate where they came from
* Integration - the funds can be spent freely because they are no longer "dirty" and tied to their criminal source
This would constitute placement, which is just the first step.

The people selling those goods and services do not actually want Bitcoin. They want the dollar value of the Bitcoin paid to them as assessed and given to them by services like Bitpay. Merchants generally are *not* choosing to hold it, they want the normal money they can use to pay their suppliers and employers and taxes.


Commodity, perhaps (albeit a very bizarre commodity which has absolutely nothing behind it except some hashed numbers which are by themselves useless, unlike other things usually described as commodities e.g. wheat, sugar, gold). Currency, not so much.
If Chuck-E-Cheese tokens or gold nuggets were easily convertible to dollars in the same way as Bitcoin is through Bitpay, they would have about as much utility as Bitcoin does at the moment. Take away the convertibility and nobody actually really cares.

The US has more assets than it does debt. Debt is also only a problem if it can't be serviced, such as in basket case economies with severe structural problems (e.g. Greece). The US, the UK etc are all doing nifty fine.
Also, current US treasury rates are below the rate of inflation. This means that the US can borrow money and will pay back less than it borrowed in real terms. Policy makers would be utterly retarded not to rinse this for all it's worth.
At any rate, the traditional solution is still working, has worked for some time and even the cataclysmic events of 2008 didn't stop it from working. Regulation provably works. Keynesianism provably works.

There is nothing illegitimate about this, and if you don't believe such then really your issue is with the concept of ownership of land, which is something I don't have a problem with.

Just-eat don't even implement PayPal, and that's a service which has massive market penetration and reach compared to Bitcoin, as well as tangible benefits for their customers (e.g. Pay after delivery, as implemented by PayPal, would be invaluable when dealing with untested and untrustworthy takeaways). If they won't take PayPal, even when it would objectively make their service more convenient to a wide number of people, why on earth would they take a minority currency like Bitcoin?
Before you say "it would save them money in fees" - Just-eat *already* directly pass on their card acceptance fees to customers in the form of a surcharge on purchases. Given that their model REQUIRES the intervention of a service like BitPay (because the funds taken need to be passed on to the actual takeaway, which also incurs overhead costs at Just-eat's end in remitting the payments to them - and no, small takeaways do not want Bitcoin, they want normal money to pay their suppliers with) it's doubtful this would save them or their customers much, if any money.
Bear in mind also that "customers" requesting Bitcoin is often wrong, what tends to happen is Bitcoiners who have never bought anything from somewhere say they would do so if they took Bitcoin.

That is nothing to do with banks in general and everything to do with Wells Fargo and a lax regulatory system that lets them change fundamental terms and conditions without notification - assuming they actually *didn't* notify you.
Here, if a bank wants to change their fees to a consumer's detriment, they are required to provide at least 30 days' notice, and the consumer has 60 days from the date of the notification within which they are allowed to close or switch their account without penalty. Surely such a common sense rule is in place in the USA?

I will grant that it may be a faster, if much much much less safe option than a SWIFT if the money is going to somewhere with a less developed infrastructure, or if the amounts aren't huge. That said, I would not personally trust it. I'd generally agree with your assessment there.


Is there actually any movement towards this? I don't think, strictly speaking, it would make much sense - money transferring agencies would probably stick with SWIFT, which is tried, tested and reliable. While a $30 fee for a transfer is probably too much for a $50 remittance, it's significantly cheaper if those $50s are bundled together with a few thousand other such transfers and settled that way (which I believe is how most such settlements take place).


I should have clarified that *for consumers* there's no real use case. For businesses there are a couple, but I wouldn't say they're strong enough to really make an impact or gain wide adoption.


Essentially it's that using PayPal doesn't require converting existing money into an entirely new currency, and brings advantages above and beyond existing currency (e.g. purchase protection, wide acceptance, the presence of someone's arse to kick if something goes wrong) whereas Bitcoin has a couple of the advantages (fast money transfer) and a lot more disadvantages (no purchase protection, limited acceptance, if you're defrauded then tough shit, massive volatility, can only be purchased through either LocalBitcoins or unregulated exchanges etc etc etc).
There's also that PayPal integrates neatly into the existing financial ecosystem, while Bitcoin requires exchanges and other shims to interact with it (the aforementioned exchanges). That makes it markedly less convenient from the perspective of someone who just has normal money and wants to spend it online.

Yes. It is a good thing. It's a very good thing, for the stability of the financial system and the economy as a whole. And it won't "get out", unless the regulatory environment changes to be far more permissive (which, frankly, in the current climate is not going to happen unless some real cretins take power). You're assuming that it will.
Even assuming your lurid worst case scenario comes to pass, you're ignoring the fact that the money supply is not the be all and end all of inflation. This is why I said above that the reserves reduce inflation from a *monetarist* perspective, since inflation (and deflation) can be and is caused by factors beyond the money supply expanding (or contracting). It could well do precisely nothing, or have no measurable impact. But this is irrelevant, since, as stated, it will not "get out". Your argument is akin to telling people not to live next to the sea in case they get eaten by Godzilla.

There is a kernel of truth in this, but it depends on if BitPay take down information about people paying through them.

There is nothing inherently superior about Bitcoin over Dogecoin. They are both poor for everyday utility at this point, and most likely will be forever more.

A bit of a specious comparison - for example, exchange rate spreads are included on the SWIFT side but not on the Bitcoin side. It also focuses purely on the monetary cost of the transaction, whereas there are other reasons why one might prefer SWIFT or credit card to Bitcoin even where it may cost more (e.g. SWIFT, when provided correct details, reliably credits the recipient's account without them having to do anything or arrange any exchange into local currency their end, whereas Bitcoin at best requires use of an exchange which is typically unregulated, at worst requires dealing with potentially shady characters on LocalBitcoins; credit cards provide chargeback protection should the holiday home actually turn out to be a roach motel and may also provide the person paying with reward points, as well as possibly the use of credit over time).

This problem will keep recurring until the Bitcoin community stops viewing anyone who enforces the money laundering and know your customer requirements that all money service businesses - exchanges, banks, whatever - are forced to adhere to by law as some sort of tyranny, and viewing those who flout them as heroes standing up against government thugs.
You can't tell everyone that AML and KYC laws don't or shouldn't apply to Bitcoin companies, so they should do nothing to screen out money launderers and drug dealers, while at the same time screaming about how it's all so unfair people view Bitcoin as being a currency for money launderers and drug dealers.

And therefore the porno site gets stiffed (lol).
I can see why porno sites might prefer a non-reversible payment method. So yeah, that plus the pseudonymity for customers might actually be a niche market for Bitcoin. Recurring billing wouldn't be possible, but someone who wants to pay a few dollars to watch bestial BDSM BBW porn behind their wife's back would probably consider it manna from heaven, and there's already enough money in pay per view to make that worthwhile, so... why not?

My point is not that I don't personally want to buy Bitcoin (although I don't), my point is that most people would not want to. The average person has no need for Bitcoin and no use for Bitcoin.
Also, if you receive your pay in Bitcoin, you WILL at some point need to interact with exchanges and wire transfers simply to participate in the wider economy around you, either that or someone else will and you're simply externalising that cost. The Bitcoin economy is simply not wide or deep enough (or, for that matter, do I personally think it will ever be) to make having your salary paid in it a winning proposition.

...no, that's not actually true. And I'm not a "coiner" by a long shot. "Legal tender" means it cannot be refused in settlement of a debt. In general it's a bit of a red herring, since most things are not debts (e.g. if you're buying something from a shop, they can refuse your dollars all they want because there is no debt) and there's nothing saying you can't settle a debt in anything else, only that the legal tender currency (be it pounds, dollars or Euros or whatever) cannot be refused.

Which is frankly not good enough when you're a currency exchanger not operating face to face with intangible currency. In that sort of scenario your KYC procedure should not have holes in it, you should be verifying all your customers as a matter of course. "We prefer not to" should not appear in your AML policies.
That's the rub of why banks don't want to deal with Bitcoin businesses - because the businesses' policies are not stringent enough and therefore expose the bank to money laundering risk.

Bitcoin's current primary function is speculation, meanwhile, and there are few goods priced specifically in Bitcoin.

Right, so in your estimation what does that mean? Because I can sure as shit hazard a guess that it doesn't mean "you can ignore all this".


The Fed has however had a measurable impact on the severity and length of recessions. The average length of recessions since 1913 has been roughly 1 year and 2 months. Between 1813 and 1913, 1 year and 10 months. (If we exclude all the ones Wikipedia describes as estimates, the number there does not meaningfully change.)
Yes, I sat down and worked this out.

The market thought so. In hindsight, that's idiotic. But at that time, people were willing to pay that much for them, so they were, in a "supply and demand" sense, "worth" that much.
They were obviously not *intrinsically* worth that much, and a Bitcoin is intrinsically worth even less than a bunch of tulips (tulips at least have a function of looking pretty if you put them in a vase). But right now, as far as the market is concerned, a Bitcoin is "worth" whatever a person will pay for it. I, personally, think that price is idiotic also. But then I'm not involved in Bitcoin.

That any profit at all is due to "monopoly pricing"? I mean I asked you to confirm, I don't want to be demolishing any strawmen here, but, nope, profit margins are monopoly pricing...
You are talking utter crap.

That doesn't necessarily follow. It would make more people elect to buy from Amazon IF they had Bitcoin and IF Amazon accepted Bitcoin.
If Bitcoin were far more popular than it is, to the point where it would make up a decent amount of their sales, and Amazon did accept Bitcoin, which they don't, then that would hold water. But it only holds any benefit for Amazon if both of those conditions are true.

That makes sense - shorts (and futures in general) are intended to provide a hedge against future price movements. Naked shorts (fnar) are pretty much an exclusive gambling thing but they're also something someone on the other end to is entering of their own free will (i.e. they want to buy XYZ security in a month at X price and are signing a contract to that effect - the fact you don't own it is irrelevant to them so long as you deliver it to them).
People round these parts are keen to describe anything the markets do as some kind of evil voodoo when, generally, there are very good explanations for these things which don't sum up to "derivatives are deviltry".
Incidentally, one way shorting *could* affect Overstock is that if there are a large number of people shorting Overstock that could indicate concern over their future share price, and so damage confidence. But it's a long shot, since most people don't pay any attention to derivatives markets.

Like I say, I'm not jealous at all, no. And the 1000x increases in price do not make the arguments of some/most Bitcoiners any less fallacious or any less based in wishful thinking.

It's not even funny. Here's the four panels rendered as text:
1. Badly drawn picture of burning buildings with a sad oval in one of them. The sad oval, who I presume is meant to be a person, does not in fact look particularly sad, rather bemused. "Bemused" is not a state of mind I consider appropriate for standing at the top of a burning building, but then I am only human, and not a collection of ovals, so what do I know?
2. Zoomed out badly drawn picture of burning buildings with people in them. It is the same picture. Thus a full half of the comic has been taken up by two sizes of the same picture.
3. Two Bitcoin logos with badly drawn faces, I suspect Microsoft Paint.  One Bitcoin logo says to the other "And you only paid 20 Satoshis?!" This would be an exceptionally small sum of money, being the smallest possible divisible unit of a Bitcoin; this is a significant flaw in the currency for OP's mother however, since it is about twelve orders of magnitude too large for the amount she usually charges for a suck and fuck down at the docks.
4. Finally, the other ovoid being replies to the other "Yea! It's just an old picture of Detroit." This is an odd choice for the final panel of a comic, seeing as this is where one would usually place the punchline, the part of the comic that provides the resolution and humour to the piece. OP has however eschewed doing so in favour of just writing something vaguely referential which has nothing to do with anything and isn't actually funny. Perhaps OP is intending to confound expectations with his work; like Radiohead with *Kid A* or Kanye West with *Yeezus*, providing a jarring contrast to what has gone before in the arts can be valuable, pushing things forward and inspiring further innovations through disregard of usual conventions. Perhaps OP is therefore a genius, who is pushing boundaries in the realm of comic strips by not only making a full half of one the same picture, and drawing everything with circles, but also completely upending the construct of humour itself by pooh-pooing the very concept of humour as we all understand it. Punchlines? An obvious set up? A joke? Humour needs none of these things, and OP is the trailblazer who realised it.  
  
Or he could just be shit at making comics and isn't very funny.

To which I'd say that given that Bitcoin's principal use currently appears to be as an investment with a side use as a currency, rather than the other way around, their decision makes all kinds of sense.


I've said this before, but barriers to entry are *good* when you're dealing with companies who hold peoples' money. Regulators have quite deliberately set up barriers to entry to prevent (as far as is practicable) conmen and fraudsters from establishing financial firms. The lax approach to this in the Bitcoin world has led to any number of scams (e.g. Neo&amp;Bee and Mt.Gox being two of the biggest examples of laughable business plans and corporate governance respectively that any competent regulator would simply laugh out of the building if they wanted to establish a deposit-taking institution).
In terms of AML and KYC meanwhile I would actually expect *at a minimum* equally stringent requirements on businesses dealing with Bitcoin, given Bitcoin's nature as positively incredible for money laundering and existing market participants' proven and complete disregard for whether they are handling dirty money or not.

Neither of those things have much to do with our historically low inflation rates but have everything to do with a whole number of complex causes, including but not limited to miserliness on the part of employers, a lack of strong minimum wage laws, deregulation and the breaking of trades unions in both the US and the UK and a slow and steady transition to a lower paid and skilled service-based economy in both of those nations (itself something with a number of complex causes) starting in the mid-1970s and accelerating under Reagan and Thatcher.

Basically, I wanted to buy a digital download someone had tipped me for on Reddit (long story). If I'd used a debit card or PayPal then that download would have been available immediately and I'd be on my way. If I'd used domestic bank transfer here it would have been done within a couple of minutes. As it is, with Bitcoin, the entire process - including waiting for enough confirmations to allow me to download it, something that simply *doesn't exist with any other payment method* - which consisted of *two transactions* took over an hour.
I'm sure I'll receive a reply along the lines of "but that's not Bitcoin's fault it's the merchant waiting for confirmations" but then that doesn't explain why a payment method should have such inherent risk that one needs to wait for confirmations for it to be safe to accept it for anything, and why one should tolerate a payment method that took, for me, 15 minutes just to get *one* confirmation, let alone the five or six the merchant wanted - when use of debit or credit cards provides "confirmation" within a few seconds.

Meanwhile Bitcoin prices as cited on many Bitcoin merchants are actually just whatever the Bitcoin value of however many dollars the merchant wants is at the time the order is placed, meaning that prices fluctuate *within a day*. Granted, the Bitcoin economy is not an especially broad or mature one, making this somewhat apples to oranges.

It's just a shame people have to potentially lose large amounts of money or have their money unjustifiably withheld from them in the meantime - something proper regulation would fix.
We as a society already did the "learning" about how to fix this sort of issue over the course of hundreds of years, and the answer was regulations and deposit insurance. Quite why Bitcoiners feel we should have to go through that painful learning process again with their spangly new Internet currency is beyond me. It's like they're slowly realising what regulation is for bit by bit as a lack of it starts to fuck them over.

I'm in full agreement with this. My most recent experience with Bitcoin was just hilariously slow compared to domestic bank transfers. I had to move some Bitcoin from one place to another and then onto another and then have the final beneficiary be able to acknowledge receipt. It would have taken me about three minutes using Faster Payments, in the event it took over an hour with Bitcoin to get the required number of confirmations at all stages of the transaction and it certainly wasn't instant. Honestly, I've seen *international payments* completed and confirmed in a shorter length of time.

So is yours.
You're the one claiming that there's massive demand for Bitcoin as a payment system. He who asserts must prove. So prove it - find a bunch of legitimate merchants who are accepting Bitcoin and are doing massive business over and above their takings in regular money.
You won't, because they don't exist, and all the numbers (e.g. Overstock, easily Bitcoin's most high profile merchant) back up which is why you have to resort to bullshit irrelevant numbers like how many subscribers this subreddit has and how much Bitpay is worth.
Additionally, the reason Bitpay's revenue and valuation is totally irrelevant is because, as I'm sure you already know, Bitpay charges a flat fee for a bumper pack of transactions rather than a percentage or per transaction fee as with merchant acquirers. So one could be paying $30 a month and not running any transactions through it, but by your measure that would be "consumer adoption" as opposed to "Bitpay being paid $30 a month to do nothing".

And my reply was that it was self-evident that completely reorganising society from the top down, which would be the only way anarcho-capitalism could possibly be implemented would be something that would lead to instability which would cost pretty much everyone lots, through violence or any other means. This is obvious. I've already said there's no sources other than the experiences of every other such reorganisation (or as we call them in the real world, "revolution"). You're splitting hairs.

@_date: 2014-01-21 18:03:24
It won't. Banks have, due to international accords such as Basel II ( been required to have much more capital (as a percentage of loans, e.g. Bank A is required to have at least 20% of its loan book on hand as capital whereas before it had to have 10% - not real figures, but you get the gist) available, so that in the event of a run, there is less chance of an individual firm collapsing and potentially leading to a systematic collapse (for example, see why Northern Rock was bailed out in the UK, or HBOS for that matter). Those reserves won't "get out" because they are *already* out in the form of the banks' loan book.
Before Basel was adopted, a number of banks (the aforementioned Northern Rock, for example) were lending based on money they were borrowing themselves while having very little actual capital. This, naturally, led to instability, especially when the credit crunch cut off that source of borrowed money and led to those banks having a gaping hole in their balance sheets. 2008 was a kick up the arse to get banks and regulators to see why this was moronic and institute capital requirements. See that big uptick on your graph? Do you notice that that uptick is precisely on 2008? When Basel's recommendations were implemented by the Fed?
Indeed, if anything those reserves *reduce* inflation from a monetarist perspective, since they reduce the circulating money supply and additionally high capital requirements dissuade further lending, further cutting down the money supply.

It's important to understand that KYC/AML is not a "gate" as such. It isn't the case that it's like "right, we asked this, you said this, we've seen your passport, cool, now do whatever the fuck you want". It's an ongoing process which has to take into account the nature of the client's transactions, whether those transactions change, whether the client's circumstances change... if someone has only been making small trades, say, and then suddenly wants to cash in $2000 worth of Bitcoin then that's a very sudden change in circumstance and volume, and would mean KYC information would possibly need to be reviewed and updated and inquiries made into where this sudden change in status came from.

Why should I (or merchants) have to change my (or their) habits to adapt to a worse system than the one already in place when the better idea would be either to wait for the system to improve to be better than the extant one, or more simply to just *not use the worse system and keep with the one that works*?

Genuine gifts are not subject to capital gains taxes unless you personally make a profit on giving them away (e.g. you convert the Bitcoin to dollars to give to someone else and make a gain that way). If you just give them to another person as is then you are not making a gain or a loss.

I just find the utter ignorance and wishful/fallacious thinking that's on display here a lot of the time to be quite disturbing and try to "counter" it. "Circlejerk" is kind of an overused term, but Christ does it suit I think Bitcoin is an interesting technology, and if someone wants to use it then fine by me, I don't care what other people do - but no way in hell do I think it is, would be or should be a good substitute for what is already in mass usage, and I think its proposed benefits are wildly overstated and its significant issues very underplayed.
There's no jealousy here, incidentally; I don't have Bitcoin, don't want Bitcoin and wouldn't have had any in the first place, so crying over not having something I couldn't have and don't want wouldn't make sense.

Features are a different thing from value though. The inability to counterfeit Bitcoin doesn't make them any more valuable, or indeed intrinsically valuable at all, although it is a nice feature.
Were this the case then any cryptocoin, from Litecoin to Doge, would be assured to have "intrinsic value" merely by virtue of its lack of counterfeiting. I could, if I cared, make my own HistoryLessonForBitcoinCoin, which nobody could (or indeed would want to) counterfeit but it still wouldn't have any intrinsic value.

Only talking about the relatively tiny minority of people who both have Xboxes and broadband Internet connections and also don't have bank accounts and/or credit or debit cards is a cop out, given that that is a population that may well not actually exist. You are also assuming that there are people in the world who do not have normal currencies but will somehow magically have or have the opportunity to have Bitcoin, a population which likely also does not exist. So by conceding that for the people who don't fit into that group Bitcoin has no real incentive, what you are actually doing is agreeing with me.
There is also a significant difference between buying an option or a future on a commodity in order to speculate on price and actually buying the commodity itself (in this case, Bitcoin). The people that buy and hoard large physical quantities of commodities like gold and silver are typically idiots; either people speculating on the price and not being smart enough to do so without using a less risky means of doing so, or gold bugs/ancaps/other assorted loons. They are not a good argument in favour of doing the same with Bitcoin.
Your idea of what bolsters Bitcoin's price meanwhile is just unsupported by reality. The price has tanked in the period after the Microsoft news, and for a more glaring reason than just it providing a means for existing Bitcoin holders to cash out with minimal risk without any incentive for new users to cash in; that all the merchants in the world supporting it will not help when existing currencies and payment methods work just as well, if not better, and that there is therefore no good reason for anyone outside ideologues who don't like the idea of government controlled money to use it. It still has no use for the vast majority of people, and as per the first part of my post its ideal target market most likely does not exist, and even if it did would be so tiny as to not make for a viable or stable Bitcoin economy.

Erm, no it isn't. Here's what I said:
* Why would Microsoft accepting Bitcoin make someone want to use it when they already have money that Microsoft accepts?
Your answer was to witter on about people who don't have that. What fallacy is it when to answer a question you bring up something entirely unrelated?


So what about DirecTV, Overstock, etc etc etc, any other number of the "This is HUGE" companies who started accepting Bitcoin? Were they not enough? Apparently not.


The ETFs are fucking pointless anyway, so partial credit there.


So why even mention it?


So because of one instance of the existing system working to protect you, if somewhat overzealously, Bitcoin (which has no such protection) is better?


You forgot to ask who actually *does* want Internet cash. And it turns out that the market for people who want irreversible transactions that can be undertaken over the Internet is pretty much limited to scammers. Frankly, the idea of cash that can be taken remotely without any recourse is idiotic anyway.


Market caps are completely irrelevant to currencies. Or should be, anyway. The fact that they are tangentially relevant to Bitcoin is not really a good thing for Bitcoin.


You don't actually know Microsoft's reasons for implementing it. It's possible they took a "build it and they will come" approach, hoping usage picks up. *My* point would be that that has not happened yet and is unlikely to ever happened.
You also can't just say that because Microsoft has implemented Bitcoin, there must be a market otherwise they wouldn't have done it. Microsoft has don't stupid shit before.

Or criticising libertarian ideology on this **completely impartial** subreddit.
@_date: 2014-02-02 17:55:39
It's not an especially anti-libertarian idea. Libertarians are (in general) minarchists - they want there to be government, but it should have extremely minimal functions, such as police forces, funded by taxation. The basic income in most guises (e.g. the one Friedman espoused) takes the form of a negative income tax for incomes below a certain amount, which could well fit neatly into a libertarian system (and indeed would do so better than things like Social Security and food stamps, if your aim is to reduce the size of government - far simpler to have just the IRS than the IRS and whatever the hell welfare authorities exist in the USA, I dunno).
I'm not a libertarian, not by a long shot, but I can understand where he'd agree with that idea. Just don't confuse libertarians with anarchists/agorists/ancaps/Austrian-school adherents, as are prevalent on - they would consider a basic income to be wrong because it involves the existence of a government and/or it would intrude on the "perfection" of the free market.

Given that you're the one who paid for false, fabricated identification documents, you're a fine one to be slinging around accusations of fraud.
However, I can only echo another person in this thread and point out that PayPal do not hide their limits and indeed make it clear what your limits for sending and receiving money are. You chose to ignore that these limits exist and got burned.

Entirely feasible, but the card number would be linked to a name, address and an account with an institution which would have done KYC checks on its customer. It would thus be very easy to see where the money has come from, or at the very least if someone is laundering money to locate them. BitPay does not have any of that. That's my point.
I recognise that this anonymity (or in actuality pseudonymity) is considered a good thing for Bitcoin, but given the impact money laundering has, and the fact no major acquisitive crime can succeed without the use of laundering, it's a terrible thing for society at large.

Uh, no. If you run a Bureau de change, you can ask for ID and if they refuse to provide it you can still refuse to take their business.

I don't care about downvotes. Bring 'em on, because I'm telling the truth here; Andreas broke the rules, one of Reddit's few rules. 
Reddit is, on the whole, very relaxed about what it hosts on its platform, as evidenced it being well known as a hive of racism, misogyny and virtually every kind of other hatred and idiocy known to man, which they are *comfortable with*. If you want to criticise anyone for not respecting freedom of speech, Reddit is pretty far down the list, and some Bitcoiner factotum explicitly breaking a clear sitewide rule in order to shill for Bitcoin is way down the list as far as free speech concerns go.

He encouraged vote manipulation in another subreddit, i.e. brigading. He broke the rules - one of five cast-iron rules that have been around for years. Reddit didn't like that and banned him. End of story. No freedom of speech implications here.

It is completely wrong to say that you are not allowed to identify your customers of they are using a Visa card. A business can identify their customers and still accept Visa - what you cannot do is force someone to provide ID *at physical point of sale* to identify themselves as a cardholder. In other words, you can ask for ID if you are doing so on an incidental basis. 
Bureau de change and gambling sites are just two types of merchant who both accept Visa and ID verify (some of) their customers.

Unless you want actual regular currency at the other end, in which case you get fucked, as has been demonstrated repeatedly.


Boy, that worked out brilliantly didn't it?


Speaking from professional experience, the unbanked are unbanked either due to poverty or distrust of anything other than hard (paper) currency. The former will not be able to use Bitcoin, the latter will not want to.


My bank account is free. It literally charges no transactional fees, the only fees are for borrowing. Pretty much all personal accounts here are.

Because Bitcoin is a currency, and investment implies putting money towards something to gain a return on it.


Fucked if I know, but I think the market of people who have Xboxes and/or Windows Phones but also don't have access to credit/debit cards or, at worst, *paper cash that can be used to buy MS points gift cards* is a vanishingly small one. You're also assuming that that very small market that has no means of obtaining any of those things somehow magically has a means of obtaining Bitcoin which is easier and safer than, say, going to a shop and buying a gift card.
The real issue here is you didn't answer my question. Why would Microsoft accepting Bitcoin make someone who *does* have money that Microsoft already accepts (the vast majority of people, and the vast majority of Microsoft's customers) want Bitcoin?


Forex is not investment. Forex is speculation. If you are buying Bitcoin to see if the price rises, you are not *investing*, as your money is not actually helping Bitcoin reach any appreciable goal or assisting it in any way; you are speculating. If you wanted to "invest" in Bitcoin, put some money towards starting an exchange or buy shares in Bitpay or something.


Sugar and oil are also a commodities, but I don't see anyone buying bags of sugar in the hopes that people stop using aspartame, or barrels of oil hoping that Tesla goes bankrupt. Plenty of people do, however, invest in sugar producing companies and oil companies.

That... isn't how exchanges work. To sell something you need a buyer, and exchanges match sellers with buyers. You don't sell coins (or stocks, or whatever) to the exchange, you sell them to a buyer that the exchange matches you with, with the exchange as an intermediary.
The reason that the price is dropping is because there are *too many* sellers and not enough buyers, so therefore they are all dropping their prices in order to attract more buyers; or, conversely, because there is too much supply and too little demand, ergo dropped prices.

Not necessarily. There's no guarantee that card charges aren't just absorbed into the company's cost of doing business, rather than passed on to customers as card charges (also bear in mind that debit card purchases get a flat fee of around 40p per transaction, so even if they were passed on the price differential would only be about that amount.)

The Steam hardware survey puts Linux usage at 1% of all users, and that is a self-selecting sample which will be higher than the average in terms of technical aptitude. Your "knowing many others that do as well" doesn't mean much in the face of the fact that upwards of 99% of all desktop computer users don't use Linux.


It hasn't especially failed because it still exists, but the fact that it hasn't obtained mass market penetration does indicate that it is at best an also-ran on the desktop and has failed at reaching an audience outside of techies.


Less than one percent of all transactions would in fact be pretty successful compared to Bitcoin's (at best) anaemic update, however it would still barely be worth talking about.


However, the quote is "the year of the Linux desktop". Linux already won on the server by virtue of being a free and stable Unix-like OS (it's a very good server OS in fact), and Android is only tenuously a success for Linux being as it is essentially just a Java virtual machine running on top of the Linux kernel. On the desktop it is sub 1%. The point of the mocking "this is the year of the Linux desktop" quote is not that Linux on the desktop, or Linux in general, is shit or useless, or that nobody uses it. The mockery is because Linux users/zealots were and indeed still are repeatedly proclaiming every year, future or present, as the year that Linux would break through into mass desktop user adoption, and when that didn't happen moving on to the next year without considering that maybe Linux *wasn't* going to break through into mass user adoption because people didn't actually want it, or that there were reasons that people might not actually want it and that these needed to be fixed.
I believe that point with replacing "Linux on the desktop" with "Bitcoin" is that the exact same pattern is slowly being followed with Bitcoin - a core, intensely passionate group of adherents is trumpeting every year as the year that Bitcoin becomes mainstream after doing exactly the same thing the previous year. 2014 was supposed to be the year of Bitcoin; now 2015 is, and according to so will 2018 be. Nothing much has actually changed to make people want Bitcoin any more than they did last year, but they will all switch over anyway.


What products or services could actually use Bitcoin in an underlying, invisible manner that couldn't be more easily/efficiently done without Bitcoin being involved at all? I struggle to think of any.

Which is totally irrelevant.


Because, in truth, I don't think drugs should be illegal. But that is an entirely separate matter as to whether Ulbricht has been correctly convicted. And he has, duly, under process of law, by a jury of his peers, under the law of the land which he deliberately broke knowing that he was doing so.
These two positions aren't contradictory.


Devil's advocate, but it could be argued that there is an interest in preventing controlled substances being obtained and therefore taken, for the prevention of addiction and its resulting harms. I'm not saying that this is necessarily the reasoning or that I agree with it, but something can be "voluntary" and still cause harm.
I should point out that this is another concept which you have decided is significant despite it not being significant at all. "Harm" is not a concept which features in the law. Nor is "voluntary". The law is what it is. If you wish to change it, the solution is to pursue it through the ballot box and through lobbying, as is your right.


I am fine with the fact that a jury of his peers convicted him after due process was followed and that he was convicted of breaking a law that he broke deliberately. That I do not completely agree with that law is irrelevant. He was properly convicted under the law of the land.


Legislation is a perfectly good justification for convicting Ulbricht for running an online drugs marketplace for a profit when that would have been a reasonably foreseeable consequence to him, it is not a good defence for killing millions of people in a systematic and industrial manner out of a sense of racial superiority. That you would attempt to even try and draw a parallel there is somewhat grotesque.

A very great deal of people, and virtually all businesses, use desktop PCs and laptops, which naturally run desktop OSes. In fact, it's a given that the people in the Steam hardware survey I mentioned that puts Linux at about 1% will all be running desktops or laptops.

No, I'm saying that the "year of Linux on the desktop"/"year of Magic Beans mass adoption" things have a significant number of parallels, in that they are both over-optimistic predictions based on either nothing or on tenuous reasons, which are then immediately revised to the next year when they are proven wrong.

To answer:
* Domestic payments within the UK up to around £10,000 tend to be free. Problem is, I don't think there are any UK based exchanges, so you move into international money transfers which can range anywhere from £4 at the low end to £25 at the high end, depending on the bank(s) involved.
* LocalBitcoins tends to have a markup on an exchange's price, as well as carrying with it inherent security and fraud risks (e.g. "meet me somewhere specific at a specific time while carrying cash/Bitcoin paper wallets", counterfeit banknotes, receiving payment for the Bitcoin with fraudulent bank transfers - a common scam).

I've considered it myself, most recently when Windows 8.1 was being shitty for me (used to use Linux full time a few years ago and then got sick of the multiple little niggly things that I couldn't do or that annoyed me). Decided against it in the end as by now I am just too invested in the platform, have bought too much software for it, works well enough for my purposes etc...
I should really have made it more clear that my criticism wasn't of Linux as a desktop OS, more of the whole "year of Linux on the desktop" thing which has been going on since at least 2004.
@_date: 2015-02-07 16:38:31
That makes no sense. The whole point of the settlement between banks is the movement of actual physical currency to match up with what they are told they will get. If you are just moving tokens which are only associated with the actual currency through some vague "currencyness", rather than the actual currency itself, there is no point whatsoever and you actually make things less trustworthy, not more, because you're not actually settling anything.
Put it another way, if you say "I'm going to give you twenty pounds sterling" and what you actually give me is a coloured coin that you claim is for twenty pounds, you haven't actually given me twenty pounds. You've given me an IOU - you still need to actually give me twenty quid. There is no good reason why I should take your coloured coin when you could just give me the twenty quid.
There really isn't any aspect that Magic Beans or a blockchain solution could help with when it comes to interbank settlements, unless what you want to settle is Magic Beans.
@_date: 2015-02-03 00:48:15
The thing is that on the first point you are both wrong in different ways. The issue with Bitcoin's money supply isn't that it is inflationary or deflationary, it is that it is inelastic. The currency will ALWAYS have 3600 new XBT a day, regardless of the size of the economy it supports. Right now the Bitcoin economy barely exists on any meaningful scale so the inflation is crippling; were Bitcoin to ever gain significant popularity though it could (probably would) outpace its money supply and lead to enormous deflation. Right now, as it stands, Bitcoin is running at about 10% annual money supply increase with an economy that  isn't growing anywhere near as much. That's absurd.
As for "premined", the concept of a large part of a currency's units either under the control of one individual or lost forever when there is a fixed supply and those units can and will never be replaced is absurd.
Finally, with regards to irreversibility, while you grant that Bitcoin isn't that good in this respect, there is no way to replicate the reversible nature of credit cards with Bitcoin without essentially just replicating the system we have at the moment, with middlemen. Thus there isn't really much point in bothering with it. 
@_date: 2015-02-24 20:21:17
The reason for the disparity is that there was no suggestion that the people running banks in 2008 were personally steering their businesses in order to generate them personal profit without due regard to the sustainability of the business while also covering up the scale of the losses. In many respects 2008 was caused less by actual institutional fraud on the part of banks, more by an overreliance on the housing market, the loosening of regulations over the course of around thirty years and incompetence on the part of those in charge of the banks, rather than any outright fraud (incompetence not being illegal, after all). In the S&amp;L crisis, what happened actually involved more outright fraud along the lines of Enron - deliberate false reporting in order to generate and maintain personal wealth.
In general, courts are very loathe to "pierce the corporate veil" unless there is a suggestion of actual criminality on the part of those steering the corporation, and this is something that predates Nixon (who was a lunatic, for the record), let alone Obama, who while not perfect is someone who has actually taken some very concrete moves towards fixing some of the fundamental issues that caused 2008 and S&amp;L with Dodd-Frank. I'd like a source for "more than 1000 white collar convictions", actually - not because I doubt you, because that sounds plausible to me given the scale of S&amp;L, just as a matter of interest.

There is no requirement for a crime to have a victim or to consist of fraud or violence, that is *your* perspective on what laws *should* be. You cannot just make a concept up and then demand that reality conform to it.
Some things are crimes because of the potential harm they cause, or the tangential harm that they cause that may be remote from the act itself. That isn't a reason for the jury to have nullified, and it's not even close to a reason *why* they would have nullified, because it's incredibly unlikely that all the jurors would have agreed with this very fringe argument.
Your argument seems to be "I don't like the concept of laws as it stands so the jury should have nullified." The jury obviously did not agree with you, and there is nothing wrong in what they did. Whether or not you agree with drugs being illegal (and I don't agree that they should be) it is very hard to argue that the jury did anything wrong in convicting Ulbricht given all the circumstances as they exist now.

I think if you don't want to get approved to join the secure interbank communication system that links all banks everywhere, that would speak more for your bank than for SWIFT.
In any event, I have never heard of a properly run bank being refused access to SWIFT, which you only say you "imagine" which implies to me that that is something you only think exists rather than something that actually exist. So we're again running up against a wall of there not really being any benefits to changing anything.
In general though, barriers to entry in financial services are a good thing. When you are dealing with other people's money, or in this case feeding into the world's only international secure interbank system, you should be able to pass certain bars of competence, good character and solvency. Allowing actors in who can't invariably adds risk to the system.

He started a massive online drugs market place and took a cut of each transaction in order to save himself from blackmailers blackmailing him about the massive online drugs market he started?


Nobody was talking about a hit. I was talking about the whole "starting Silk Road" thing, of which going to jail is a very foreseeable consequence, but which he did anyway in order to make money. It is really, really hard to see how it is the fault of the *law* (a law which *I do not support*, for full clarity) that he decided to start Silk Road.
But, since you've gone down that road, I will further point out that your comparison *still* doesn't work because while escaping a Nazi death camp saves your life but kills nobody else, ordering a hit on someone (and also that someone's roommates, going by the evidence) may potentially save your life but will also end the lives of at least one other.

I'm not exactly sure what you mean. To do the settlement itself, banks have correspondent accounts with other banks, which they route payments through. So say you want to send £1000 from HSBC UK to Bank of America, there would be a swift message to MIDLGB22 instructing them to credit an account at BOFAUS3N, and in the background HSBC would credit their correspondent account with Bank of America with £1000 for onward payment to the beneficiary. As such there isn't really anything to "respect" because the transfer just "happens".


To feed into the SWIFT system you need to be a recognised and accredited financial institution or affiliated with one. There are no known cases where "trust" has been failed in this manner, although I'm also unclear as to what you mean by this.
The one thing I can tell you is that Bitcoin simply could not replace the settlement part of SWIFT because Bitcoin only deals in settling one thing; the Bitcoin unit of account, and not every currency in the world plus some commodities. Maybe if you instructed a Bitcoin transfer with SWIFT it would work, but not for any other currency or anything else (leaving aside why you would be instructing a Bitcoin transfer using SWIFT in the first place.)
@_date: 2015-02-18 09:53:23
Banks hold nostro and vostro accounts with each other, "correspondent accounts". The settlement takes place as a movement of currency between the  correspondent account of the paying bank and the correspondent account of the recipient bank. So in your case the US bank would credit their account with the Asian bank with the amount of the payment.
In some/most situations the paying bank won't directly have an account with the recipient, so they will credit an intermediary bank that *does* have such an account and request they forward the funds on.

Yep, that's wrong and illiberal. But then that doesn't mean that every single conviction by jury is also wrong or prima facie suspect. Not least since that is a totally different issue to the one under discussion (linking to material, which is protected as free speech, as opposed to deliberately breaking the law for profit.)
You seem to think that if you can produce an example of the law producing a perverse outcome that everyone would agree is perverse, then that automatically makes anything you disagree with also perverse. That, again, is not true.

First of all, SWIFT is not technically a transfer method. SWIFT is an interbank communications method that is used for instructing transfers between and inside institutions, and a lot more besides - secure interbank messaging, international stock settlements, all sorts. For instance, you can use a SWIFT 199 message to send a secure interbank message or a 103 for a single customer credit transfer. SEPA is also not a payment method, it is a class of payments which are mandated to have certain criteria - chief amongst them being that they must credit, at the latest, the working day after they are sent. They are also required to be charged at the same fee rate as a domestic Euro payment, so the fee may well be nil but will vary from bank to bank.
So SWIFT and SEPA are not mutually exclusive. A SEPA payment can be instructed through SWIFT. The settlement all happens on the backend, between banks. SWIFT just makes that simpler. It is also not outdated - it is incredibly flexible and does things and handles volumes that would make Bitcoin wind up crying in the corner out of pure shame.
Source: my day job involves dealing with SWIFT heavily. 
@_date: 2015-02-07 17:36:28
If we're talking individuals (which is weird, because we were talking about SWIFT and interbank settlement before) then I really have no idea what you're trying to say or why coloured coins would help anything at all. If you're going to have an IOU that you then settle independently then making it use a coloured coin is completely superfluous, it doesn't actually help in any way whatsoever.


No, they move money between their accounts at correspondent banks, or inside a single country they will use the national settlement system (e.g. Bank of England accounts held by the clearing banks in the UK).

Nothing in the article says they are considering using Bitcoin - and given that they don't actually impose a settlement method on their members that isn't something they could mandate anyway. They are just discussing Bitcoin.
Ripple would work quite nicely for the settlement part, in principle, although we'd then be raising the question of what problem it would solve given that there are no real issues with the current system.

You decide if a law is good or bad through judicial review and the concept of checks and balances, as instituted - imperfectly - in the United States.
You seem somewhat obsessed with linking anything that might in any way involve a government or judiciary to Nazi Germany. Once again, and I will say this more clearly: *you cannot take the worst possible example of a concept and claim that it invalidates each and every instance of that concept regardless of context or intent*. That is manifestly bullshit.
As is your standard of "fraud or aggression", because there are many things societies outlaw because it is more conducive to the public good to outlaw them than it is to allow them, but they do not specifically come under your impossibly small heading of "fraud and aggression". Speeding, demonstrably, kills people; as a result it is outlawed. Selling tainted food poisons people, as does having a restaurant filled with cockroaches, as a result governments have laws against these things and mandate inspections of food serving premises. In the financial field, mixing client and firm assets is also prohibited. 
I feel like breaking out the "fear and love" scene from Donnie Darko, where the teacher attempts to break down all concepts and emotions to just "fear and love", because this is the same sort of nonsense. You cannot reduce all things down to "fraud and aggression", that is nonsense. It also tosses away all of the past god knows how many years of precedent and case law based on *your* contention that those two things are sufficient. You are entirely right that the common law started with "fraud and aggression"; what you fail to recognise is that the common law (the actual concept of it, not the whackadoodle concept of it some people advance) also consists of case law setting precedents, with statute being instituted where there are gaps in this and where the democratic majority wants it. This is not just how things are, this was how the framers of the US constitution (and those who instituted the common law system in England which the US largely adopted whole cloth) *actively intended it to be*. The only reason you would want to reset everything back to just "fraud and aggression" is if you are so ignorant of the actual historical basis for the system being what it is today that you think just hitting the reset button and starting again from scratch will make for utopia.

[No it wasn't]( NASD Regulation is/was a *subsidiary* of the NASD that regulated the NASDAQ. So Madoff was in no way in charge of a regulator.
YOU ARE TALKING SHIT.
Edit: Screenshotted for when you inevitably delete your post because it shows you up as an utter clown:

NO. IT. DIDN'T. That is the core of your bullshit. It's false. Not true. Can you cite *any* reputable source saying that Nasdaq - the stock exchange, and the thing Madoff was chairman of - itself became FINRA, as opposed to its ultimate owner the NASD or NASDR?

The problem is that changing the trust mechanism there doesn't really make anything better or solve any problems. There aren't any counterparty risk issues as the settlement is of cash and the transfer is not effected until the settlement is; there is no credit being provided or any actual risk.
There is no reason why SWIFT couldn't handle Bitcoin, being as all SWIFT is is formatted messages. It probably could today so long as the settlement back end was in place. There is just no need for it to.

You're right, but you've missed the point. A currency that inflates (or deflates) its money supply independently of the growth or recession in the economy it serves is a terrible idea. Right now, Bitcoin's economy needs to grow about 10% a year to keep pace with its money supply and it hasn't done anywhere near that. After the block halving it will need to grow about 5%. Then again... and then by the time no new coins are being produced it will need to stagnate to not produce rampant deflation.
It's really, really terribly designed.


First of all, citation needed. But in any event, that USD is not irrevocably lost and can be transferred to other people. It can also provide lending and investment in other businesses in the form of bank deposit and stocks, which generates economic growth. Satoshi's coins (and any other coins which have been lost) will just sit there forever doing nothing useful for anyone other than make an already pointlessly scarce supply even more pointlessly scarce.

It simply isn't the same thing.
Also "SWIFT settlements" is a misnomer. A SWIFT payment order message is sent alongside covering funds. It is not an IOU in any sense as no credit is provided on the basis of it.

Congratulations! You have proved that Madoff served on the board of directors and board of governors of the NASD. That is an improvement. You don't specify for how long, which is an important thing, since he may (like with the NASDAQ) only have been chairman for a couple of years, and your original reason for bringing this up was to complain about regulatory capture, but the NASD is and was a *self regulatory* organisation. But, you know, it's a claim you've been able to back up, if only in the most glib and misleading way - "Bernie Madoff was in charge of a regulator", so hey, you've got that. 
However, what you have *not* done is provided any support for your completely bizarre and nonsensical understanding of how the NASD is structured, these mystical two NASDAQs that you made up and have now pretended you didn't talk about and the absurd idea that the NASDAQ owned its own regulator. All of which *you made up* without admitting that you might have said something stupid. Why should anyone listen to you?

Fully agreed, drugs should be legal and regulated. However, in the real world, they're illegal, and running an online drugs marketplace is too, and going to jail is a foreseeable consequence of doing so.
"Selling drugs is not necessarily a bad thing" and "Ross Ulbricht was correctly found guilty" are not mutually exclusive.
@_date: 2015-02-14 15:52:43
So then you will have no problem citing a source for your claim that "NASDAQ" was a regulator, and an organisation distinct from the "NASDAQ" that is a stock exchange now, when Bernie Madoff was chairman of it for the three years 1990, 1991 and 1993. You will also have no problem citing a source for [your contention that NASD, the former financial self-regulation organisation, was in fact *owned* by NASDAQ](
This is of course in direct opposition to [Wikipedia]( 


Which cites the [Library of Congress](


So I would imagine that, as you are so certain, you will have absolutely no issue providing proof for your assertion that the NASD, the organisation everyone but you seems to think founded the NASDAQ, was in fact owned by it, and that NASDAQ itself had a "specific regulation committee within Nasdaq with direct authority over the Nasd", and therefore that the NASDAQ stock exchange itself had regulatory powers over the NASD, which everyone but you seems to think was a regulator in its own right. OR that there was another organisation, a regulator called "NASDAQ" that nobody else seems to think exists but you, and that this miraculously owned the NASD and then disappeared without trace, and that Bernie Madoff was in fact the chairman of this weird "ghost NASDAQ".
EDIT: Just for anyone reading this: has said he "doesn't have time to waste" on sourcing his ludicrous and nonsensical claims.

Societies have lots of laws that don't focus on direct physical harm of another human being. Fraud does not physically harm another human being (financial harm isn't physical harm). Speeding does not physically harm another human being (unless you run someone over, obviously.) That doesn't automatically invalidate those laws.
The thing is, it is perfectly coherent to say that something doesn't cause anyone physical harm but it should still be disallowed. Things can cause harm to society; they can be *dangerous*, in that they cause actual danger to others, even if they do not directly cause harm to other people every time they are done. You can argue that laws that do not relate to actual direct physical harm are immoral and wrong, and that's at least a principled stand even if I think it's wrong, myopic and ultimately would lead to a worse society for everyone in it (albeit not in the case of drugs, which should be legal, taxed and regulated), but the fact remains that those things are illegal, and that the consequences of doing those things are that you expose yourself to punishment from the entity that maintains a monopoly of force over the territory you are in.
Ross Ulbricht knowingly did things that he knew would lead to his conviction and incarceration. The consequences of his actions were obvious from the start. He is not an innocent victim.

There isn't much to actually invest Bitcoin into at present. Most of the ways people make money from it are capital growth (i.e. deflation makes the currency worth more, thus you can sell it for more than you paid for it) as opposed to income (since Bitcoin doesn't pay interest and investment opportunities are scarce).
It is not, or at least not any more, a path to just getting free money.
I would also add that if you are intent on investing your own money into Bitcoin then please do not do as some very foolhardy people have and put large sums into it in the hopes of getting rich quick while leaving yourself short for things such as, well, school. It is volatile, you could see huge capital losses.

3) QE is not the US Government "returning funds with printed money". QE is "borrowing funds from printed money". You did correctly describe what the Federal Reserve does, so partial credit there. And everyone is getting all their money back, they get the face value of their bond back plus interest on the expiration date. If this is where you introduce some wanky definition of "all their money" which means if there has been inflation in the meantime it isn't "all their money" then please spare me from it, since by that standard nobody with any savings gets "all their money back" if they withdraw it.

An interesting theory, which requires that nobody at Ghash.io be ideologically or personally invested into Bitcoin enough to refuse the money, and also that "banksters" (who? That's a very wide term) give enough of a fuck to want to bribe people with millions of dollars.

If you're using Bitcoin to increase capital gains (and this is the only way you can derive a profit from Bitcoin itself at this point), the only way you can get those is by holding onto them and hoping you can sell for a greater price in the future. As such your aim will be to hold onto as much Bitcoin as possible in the hope of proportionally greater gains. This keeps the Bitcoin out of circulation, reducing liquidity and accelerating deflation.
EDIT: "Accelerating deceleration?" I was very drunk.

And Chrome is part of iOS because I can install it on my iPad! And Dogecoin is part of Windows because I can install it on my PC! And and and and...
Just admit you're wrong.


In other words, they're submitting stuff to the AWS Marketplace, which people can use **optionally** if they want to accept Bitcoin. Fair dos.


And you have made this up. If Amazon wanted to sell "the most complete ecosystem" then they'd have integrated all those also-rans you mentioned.
You have, again, completely taken what you would like to happen and decided that it will.


Amazon won't, because the market demand for a platform to sell goods sold in Bitcoin is tiny while the market size for a platform to sell goods sold in normal currency is, to put it in terms you can understand, "very very big".


You are delusional.


AHAHAHAHAHAHA god you're a cretin.
The Amazon.com "technical support staff" (LOL) obviously would otherwise be sitting around doing nothing until the time came to install this marvellous new funbux processing software, so they wouldn't need to be diverted from anything else? And there wouldn't need to be any sort of testing of any kind? Do you even have the slightest clue as to what IT projects involve, even disregarding corporate bureaucracy? May I suggest you Google "IT implementation plan" for a quick overview of the various steps that would need to be taken, all of which take time and therefore cost money in staff time?


Not being privy to market sensitive information about Amazon's merchant acquiring facilities, I can only give an educated guess, but I would wager that given the volume of transactions Amazon process each and every single day it's a drop in the ocean.
And more to the point, even if I accept they'd save money on Bitcoin (which isn't certain), accepting Bitcoin wouldn't directly save them any decent sums of money on this front unless a significant percentage of their customers moved over to Bitcoin, which - bluntly - is not going to happen. You wouldn't just save money just by accepting the damn things, you'd need to have people using them instead of credit cards.


Yes because nothing web services companies do costs them money at all.
You're an idiot. You know nothing about business, you know nothing about IT, and almost everything you have said so far has been absolute, unequivocal horseshit. You need to stop expounding about how wonderful Bitcoin is by talking about subjects you clearly know not even the slightest things about. Come back once you have a clue.
@_date: 2013-12-21 16:39:06


An outright lie, since AWS in and of itself does not provide any of those things, rather providing a platform for other people to provide them. The only payment methods integrated into AWS, via [Amazon Flexible Payments Service]( are bank transfer, credit card and Amazon Payments.




False. It is a supposition.


So changing a production website used by millions if not billions each day is free, is it? No staff costs, no development costs (saying "Amazon uses AWS so it's easy" is stupidly simplistic and reductive) no testing costs, no nothing? And there'd be no need to support customers using Bitcoin to make payments, also at a cost to Amazon.com?
You're an idiot, and you're deluded.


You're forgetting the other part of the business case, which is the actual size of the market, and the potential market for people buying things with Bitcoin is utterly tiny and insignificant compared to the people who want to buy from Amazon with real money.
And, the other point, which is that Amazon's suppliers want dollars, pounds and Euros, not funbux, which they will incur charges in converting from.


Good for them. It would cost Amazon money too.
@_date: 2013-12-21 14:55:20


Amazon being (in part) a web services company and having the technical capability to integrate Bitcoin into its retailing operations does not mean accepting Bitcoin is trivial for them or makes good business sense.


An assertion you have pulled directly out of your anus because it would be good for Bitcoin if they did. Also known as wishful thinking.


Yes, sure, if they do this improbable thing that won't make them much money and that they have no real incentive to do and then that other improbable thing that won't make them much money and that they have no real incentive to do then it'll be really cheap for them to do the first improbable thing that won't make them much money and that they have no real incentive to do!
And we're onto wishful thinking again.

I can't be bothered to remake [the same comment I made earlier today on this exact same subject which pointed out why this argument is complete horseshit on a stick]( but I'll just go ahead and point out that the Internet was a completely transformative technology that introduced a fundamental change in the way people did a great many things to the point where the benefits over the previous way are both overwhelming and obvious, whereas for most people there is no benefit to using Bitcoin over normal money and the range of services provided by banks, and in fact many good reasons not to use Bitcoin over those things.

Nobody will. If you have enough regular currency that you could buy a plane, converting it into Bitcoin subjects it to a potential exchange rate loss that would be quite sizeable. There is also the risk that the price falls and you are also subject to a capital loss.
Unless you got a discount on the plane high enough to offset this risk, there's no real reason why anyone would buy one with Bitcoin.

Shut up. Go away. Your argument is fucking nonsense. "Not taxing people" is inherently political because it goes to the heart of how society and nation states are organised and funded as much as taxation does.
You and the cretins like you are the entire problem. I don't particularly *like* Bitcoin. I do like *discussing* Bitcoin. As someone who has numerous strong objections to Bitcoin as it stands and as it would overall stand in an economic sense, putting my argument across is made fucking unpalatable because idiots like you insist on me arguing out your entire fucking political philosophy every time I post something that disagrees with Ron Paul-esque libertarian wank fantasies about smashing the evil "fiat" that reach an almost religious zeal. I can't make the point that a Bitcoin economy wouldn't support a great level of credit without people telling me it's a good thing because the evil Fed and bankers and furthermore. I can't argue that a complete lack of protection is a terrible thing for consumer adoption without people telling me regulation is evil and it's the price you have to pay for freedom if people get fucked over. It's nonsense. If I wasn't here solely to be, at least in my own mind, a counterpoint to the circlejerking here, I'd have been repulsed long ago.

Oh goody. I get to explain basic concepts to someone. Again.
Not in the lending institution, no. Presuming you mean the *borrowing* institution, partially yes, but before you go "AHA THAT MEANS THEY'RE UNRELIABLE AND THEREFORE THEY COULD GO BUST AND THEREFORE YOU ARE WRONG AND BITCOIN IS THE BEST AND RON PAUL IS PRESIDENT", it's worth pointing out again that *no modern Western country has ever defaulted on its debts* (despite the best efforts of Teabagger idiots earlier this year, or the PIIGS economies which have their own structural problems which the UK and the US do not have) and given the fact that the US is still the world's largest economy is exceptionally unlikely to do so. It's not *impossible* for them to default, but the chances of them doing so (for economic and fiscal policy reasons, as opposed to idiot congressmen who want to watch the world burn) are incredibly remote.
The fact is that all money and all finance is based on a small measure of faith, including dollars, including Bitcoin. As such I'm not sure what your point is.
@_date: 2013-12-21 10:46:28
First off, you're assuming that I'm trolling, and I'm not, I just find a large swathe of the Bitcoin community's weird wishful thinking and odd ideology to be disturbingly cult like and feel it needs a counterpoint, especially when people say things that are factually incorrect (which admittedly hasn't happened here) or expound how much they know about things they are utterly ignorant about. If that irritates people, it says more about them and their capacity for dealing with disagreement than it does about me.
You are entirely right on the last point. Bitcoin may not fade away and may become something in wide, mass market use, or it might implode. I don't know. I think the latter is more likely, but that's just me.

I'm not sure whether I get where you're coming from but you just phrased it badly, or you're just talking nonsense.
Bitcoin has a cost of entry into the system as your currency needs to be in Bitcoin to use it. You still need US dollars or any other currency to spend US dollars, obtained by selling stuff, working, whatever. Theoretically, the same is possible with Bitcoin.
The issue is most people have currencies that aren't Bitcoin and there is no real benefit to them in exchanging them for Bitcoin. Even for most potential uses, it introduces more issues than it solves due to the need to convert at each end.
@_date: 2013-12-26 20:07:27
The discourse is what I meant, not the technology, that's poor wording on my part.
As for people being tricked, I think there are a significant group of people who are using Bitcoin as some sort of experiment for their minarchist ideology, of going around central banks and regulations etc, and are hooking people into this by promising whatever will make it sound good ("It's like PayPal without the fees!", etc etc etc) and downplaying the risks involved ("...but there's no regulation or consumer protection and if someone scams you tough shit"). Just my opinion based on seeing a lot of the discussions around here.

**TALKING POINT   
**"There is a thriving market for Bitcoin purchases; this one guy I know proves it!"**


That wasn't special pleading. At all. It's only special pleading if he actually moved the goalposts in any way - he didn't. YOU were the one who asserted he did by bringing up the "$1000 per bitcoin" thing. Frankly, arguing by just pointing to what logical fallacies someone made without actually talking about their arguments (which is what you did) is for dullards, but that's called a strawman.
A good case of "special pleading", actually, is where you decided to bring up Western Union's stock price (which is completely irrelevant) after he pointed out that Western Union has several orders of magnitude more outlets than there are Bitcoin ATMs in the world.
But I didn't point that out, obviously, because just smugly going "HA HA YOU USED A FALLACY so I can ignore everything you said!" is for dickheads and neckbeards. But I repeat myself.


Let's see, how about how Bitcoin is a currency in and of itself whereas Western Union's key business, remittances and urgent cash transfers, is about the transfer of currency across the world instantly? I suppose you could say they're comparable in that they could both be used to *send money to someone* but the similarities end there. 
There are no quick, simple ways, for example, to get local currency out of Bitcoin (other than of course unreliable, unregulated exchanges which have a habit of taking peoples' money, having massive delays on withdrawals or just collapsing; or LocalBitcoins, which is infested with scammers), whereas that's the entire point of WU.

And what a tragedy it is that people can buy houses without having to have saved up the whole amount.
I mean, yeah, house prices are overinflated (at least in my country), but a Bitcoin based economy wouldn't solve that issue. It would just mean people couldn't buy houses, or that sellers who were already mortgaged would have significant negative equity and likely bankruptcy. All it would really do is mean people would rent, thus enriching landlords and the already wealthy.
It is also a significant disincentive to adoption of Bitcoin as anything other than a niche currency for Internet geeks, since credit is a fairly fundamental part of our modern society and astonishingly useful for all sorts of things.

The fact everyone keeps using the same tired arguments over and over? That negativity, or even a note of caution, is relentlessly downvoted? That complete nonsense - things that are factually incorrect and have absolutely no bearing on reality - is upvoted because it fits with the narrative of "Bitcoin is great, the US dollar is going to crash, fiat currency is doomed"?
is an echo chamber. It's worse than in a way, because at least is an echo chamber where they just encourage people to be dicks in an otherwise-harmless manner, is an echo chamber which encourages people to buy into what currently is acting like and being used as a security for capital gains, which I personally feel is irresponsible and underhand (since nobody declares their vested interest when telling everyone that the thing they stand to profit off is really really good and has no downside).


Not even slightly comparable. It's fine to talk ABOUT Bitcoin - what makes a circlejerk is that Bitcoin is only ever talked about in positive terms, and those who do not do so are either ignored or downvoted or responded to with the same talking points that have been done to death and are mostly demonstrably wrong.

You have an example right before your eyes of no regulation ending up badly and you insist it can't be a problem with having financial instruments be totally unregulated, it has to be a problem with... something else!
And opt-in regulation is just an idiotic idea on all sorts of levels, it does nothing to stop people being swindled, nor does it stop market abuse or any one of the myriad things that are regulated against. It works for the people doing the swindling.

Both reasonable points - legal tender status is reserved for national currencies (or supranational, e.g. the Euro) so that isn't surprising in any way.
The tax position would be complicated. If they were commodities, they could be subject to VAT on purchase and sale; if they're a currency, then the goods purchased and sold with them would be subject to VAT. Either way, I wouldn't be going and saying YAY TAX FREE until you had a definite legal position. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 15:01:48


You have cause and effect round the wrong way. Interest rates were dropped to 0.5% at the same time as QE was started, in March 2009, because the Bank of England recognised that given the complete impossibility of reducing the interest rate further, the relatively blunt economic policy tool of interest rates could no longer be used to stimulate the economy to the degree that it needed to.
QE doesn't mask the effect of interest rates being low, it is **intended to exacerbate them**.


The Government has absolutely no power to get "tired" of giving out "essentially free" bonds/loans, since QE is authorised by the Monetary Policy Committee (which sets interest rates, amongst other things) which is independent of government. The only way the Government could stop selling bonds to the BoE is for them to stop issuing bonds, which frankly is not going to happen.
Additionally, raising interest rates would cause a *reduction* in inflation, since it would reduce demand for borrowing and increase demand for savings, and therefore lead to less money circulating throughout the economy. That is completely counterproductive to what anyone (at least, anyone at the Government or the BoE) wants to achieve.
This is also ignoring that, despite the generally shit economic policies of the Tory government, inflation is still incredibly low by historical standards.

Lol. I like this game:


Didn't say that, I said that there is a *risk* to the purchaser in that the value may go down or up to the extent that it could materially change the price paid for the goods. You can use it perfectly well, but you cannot deny that that risk exists. Especially since these guys note specifically on their page that prices are "at the current exchange rate".


Also didn't say that. I said that nobody will buy a plane with Bitcoin (which I'll admit is an educated guess on my part), and that most people don't have all their money in Bitcoin (which is true) so that at some point they will need to convert their money to it if they want to spend in Bitcoin, which at sufficiently large amounts will lead to an untenable exchange rate loss.

Why should a merchant take that risk? If I pay for something on my debit card and the merchant gets an authorisation code, that money is *guaranteed* to be paid to them (albeit with the risk of chargeback in the case of fraud or a dispute, which can be defended). A double spend isn't possible.

Average Billy Bob Amazon Customer will not use an escrow feature and will probably not know how to (on the off chance that he uses Bitcoin at all). Such a thing is also reliant on the merchant offering to use the escrow feature, whereas chargeback rights are included in every merchant acquiring contract and are provided to everyone with a credit card regardless of whether the merchant wants to offer them or not (and a good deal of debit cards).

Sorry, but this is all horseshit. Amazon's business is overwhelmingly designated in already extant and widely used currencies, and there is no great mass market demand for them to accept Bitcoin.
Amazon couldn't give a toss about Bitcoin. They have no reason to accept it - they buy from suppliers in existing  currencies which are far more stable, so Bitcoin just means they have to introduce a whole new layer of forex into their operations with a currency which has nowhere near a stable value and where the stability and availability of exchanges is a concern. The amount of profit they'd make is minimal, even assuming "no fees" which is just bollocks; Bitcoin provides for transaction fees, and there are still costs involved in accepting Bitcoin, especially if they actually want to pay the people they buy the goods from to sell to you.
So yeah, more Bitcoin bullshit.

Probably nothing to say "we accept Bitcoin", quite a lot to modify their website (which is entirely geared around credit cards and their own gift certificates) to accept it, and then to process the transactions, including exchanging the coin to money that suppliers actually want.
The Bitcoin market *in its entirety* is a drop in the bucket compared to how much Amazon has in revenue each year.


Or perhaps you fail to realise that, at the end of the day, we are engaging in guesswork here regarding what Amazon pays, since none of us work for Amazon, however it's reasonable to say it will be far less than the 2-3% quoted around here - I accept that neither side could provide evidence of this either way. The part of that post they *could* prove they didn't, and moreover it also ignores the key question of why Amazon would bother to accept Bitcoin at all given the piddly amount of turnover at stake. Even granting "it costs less to process", that isn't a good business case, since processing costs are not the be all and end all.

You are economically illiterate. No major Western economy is anywhere near "hyperinflation". "Hyperinflation" is inflation in the sense that it existed in the Weimar Republic, where it was more profitable for people to use banknotes as kindling than to buy firewood with them, where the money is completely and totally worthless. US dollars are absolutely nowhere near that, and QE is being tapered away anyway - it has had a very, very minor impact on inflation.
At any rate, Bitcoin is not a good solution to hyperinflation other than in the sense that it is a different currency. It is very vulnerable to inflation in and of itself as there is no central bank or regulation which could possibly be used to slow down inflation should it occur (putting aside Bitcoin's generally deflationary nature for a second). I appreciate that Bitcoin's supporters probably think that's a good thing. They are wrong.
Your general tone sounds like someone stockpiling food, gold and guns because they think society will collapse into a race war any day now, and it bears the same fundamental problems. When the day comes - IF the day comes - that the dollar collapses due to hyperinflation, Internet funbux are not going to help you, and the range of currencies Amazon accepts will be so devastatingly irrelevant compared to the violent shitstorm going on around you it'll make the food, gold and guns people look prescient.

People on tend have a lot of trouble with basic financial concepts.
For : shorting is where you agree to sell an asset you do not currently own at a set price in the future, and hope that the price of the asset goes down in the meantime so you can make a profit. It's a use of futures (which on the whole are intended, like other derivatives, to plan ahead and hedge risks - i.e. you know when you sell your coins you WILL get $X for them).
Bitcoin, at present, does not allow for futures.

You SUPPOSED all of this. It came straight out of your arse. It requires Amazon to first of all have Bitcoin as part of AWS (or to have it offered as a package for sale on AWS Marketplace, whatever), and then to want to implement it into their ecommerce side of things. There is also no question of AWS "adopting" anything in any sense because, as has been stated, they just sell other peoples' software. Just because they sell software to deal with other Internet funbux doesn't mean they've "adopted" those.
You are talking shit.


No, that YOU have dismissed as invalid without any form of reasoning.


I made no such claim. I said that the things you were pointing to as evidence that AWS "supports" other cryptocurrencies were software submissions created by third parties on their Marketplace. That first party services exist on AWS Marketplace is not surprising or even slightly relevant, nor does it make it likely that Amazon itself will create a Bitcoin one as a first party service, which in turn does not make it likely that Amazon.com itself will start accepting Bitcoin.
Your supposition is essentially the same as "there's a Bitcoin wallet app on the Google Play store, that means Google are going to integrate Bitcoin into Android and accept it in exchange for apps and games and music!" Only the first bit isn't even true of AWS Marketplace. You have just made up a load of stuff and, because it sounds nice to you, said it will happen.


No it isn't, you would just like that to be the case and it sounds vaguely plausible to you.


And no they're not. Not least since, even if I granted that they *were* going to adopt Bitcoin as part of AWS, such things still have a deployment cost which would need to form part of a substantive business case.

3) Your contention was nobody would lend to the US government because they don't get paid back. The actual truth is that they do - while the *national debt* doesn't get paid back all in one hit, in toto, the individual bondholders *do* get their money back after the expiration date of their bonds.

Ahh, libertarian cranks. Hilarious.


Amazingly, it hasn't:   
The value of the USD has remained fairly constant, within a range of maybe $0.10 to the £ and $0.10 cents to the EUR. That is not hyperinflation. It is "inflation", that much is obvious (a small measure of inflation is generally considered a good thing - you generally want people spending their money, not just sitting on it in the hopes it gets more valuable later) but not "hyper"inflation.
You also show a complete misunderstanding of what Quantitative Easing actually is. It isn't just "printing money", it is printing money to purchase US treasury securities - lending money to the Government WHICH WILL BE REPAID. It is not just distributing this money into the wider economy for funzies. Also not going to destroy the dollar. You acknowledge this by saying that the excess money has "largely" been absorbed into financial instruments while missing the salient point that the entire point of QE is for the money to be placed into financial instruments. This will, obviously, cause a measure of inflation - government bonds are used to finance government expenditure, and this money does then circulate into the wider economy. But given that QE is being tapered, bond purchases are projected to stop mid-2014 and it has been going on for the best part of five years without causing the sky to fall in, this talk of "hyperinflation" is just stupid. It also, again, betrays a complete misunderstanding of what "hyperinflation" is, and ignores that Bitcoin is in no way a solution to it.
There is also the point that the Fed has absolutely no reason to take any action which is apparently so obviously going to destroy the dollar - which is, after all, the only thing the Federal Reserve is concerned about, preserving the dollar - that random Internet libertarians are apparently able to "prove" it using primary school maths.

Bitcoin is not transformative in the same way as the Internet was, not even close. For virtually all use cases, we already have better products available that do the same thing with advantages over Bitcoin, without Bitcoin's significant disadvantages (such as a total lack of regulation and the incurring of foreign exchange spread should you need to, for example, use the currency to live on.)
Presumably this is to say that I have no "technical insight and vision" because I don't agree Internet funbux are the future. And you haven't said HOW my point that for most people there is no benefit is moot, you've just said it is without saying anything to dispute that. You have no way of saying "problems of usability and volatility" will be solved in the future, largely because the decentralised nature of Bitcoin means there's absolutely nothing and nobody with the ability to control that volatility other than unregulated market forces, and the currency is inherently deflationary. Presumably in this instance "vision" means "wishful thinking" - you want it to be so, so it will be, regardless of the significant issues involved.

1. Bitcoin has transaction fees.
2. Coinbase, Bitpay etc charge fees. It is not free.
3. No chargebacks - true, and good for merchants, but a significant issue for *purchasers* who would otherwise have recourse if the business fucked them over or they are defrauded.
4. The dramatic swings in exchange rates mean prices would have to be updated constantly, leading to either no certainty for the consumer or no certainty for the business. (i.e. business has widget that it buys in dollars and then sells online. Consumer saves up 1BTC to pay for it, which the business will convert directly to dollars. Then, Bitcoin suddenly crashes in value compared to the dollar - the business either has to eat the loss and still charge 1BTC, or the consumer has to save up another BTC for their widget, inconveniencing them. If the same widget costs $1000 now, chances are it will still cost them $1000 tomorrow, or the next day, or a year from now.)

Lovely, except that that point is completely irrelevant to the topic at hand, and is a response to a point nobody made. My point was that the reason Bitcoin does not appear in Amazon's AWS Marketplace (something you brought up) is because nobody has submitted it.

So why not ask them why they don't support Bitcoin?
Oh wait, it's because all of those things on AWS Marketplace are from THIRD PARTIES. Other people make them and add them to AWS, similar to Steam or, well, Amazon.com itself. So presumably the Delego or Chargify people found it worth their while to market that software for sale. Maybe other people bought it, maybe they didn't. Either way, Amazon doesn't actually make it, support it or endorse it, they are a middleman.
So - fail.

Honestly, I can't be bothered, since my main aim with this account is to respond to factual inaccuracies and stupid talking points about Bitcoin, finance and economics in general rather than actually putting forward any views of my own (and I'm not entering into any sort of debate here, so please don't expect me to reply - especially since my comment history makes a number of my views quite plain). But in short, in my view, Bitcoin is a neat proof of concept that has had a whole stupid ideology forced onto it and is subject to a great deal of wishful thinking, misplaced optimism, general ignorance of basic facts and cult-like behaviour.

False equivalency fail. Using email incurs no additional costs on the part of the person receiving it (assuming they already own a computer) and moreover has tangible benefits to all parties (since email is more or less free, it is quicker than snail mail, less labour intensive than telegrams, doesn't require tying up a phone line and buying specific equivalent like fax), whereas Bitcoin would require accepting an entirely different currency and performing forex conversions through unstable and unreliable exchanges at an extremely unstable exchange rate, involving a spread and therefore a direct cost, unless EVERYONE ELSE converts to using Bitcoin as well, since Tesco will have suppliers that want paying and will want the prevailing currency, who will have staff who want paying in the currency they can use for their bills and rent - which is the prevailing currency - and so on and so forth.

A deflationary currency is a terrible idea if you want a growing economy, especially a growing consumer sector.
It only sounds like it would be appealing if you think "inflation" is automatically bad and "deflation", being the opposite, is therefore automatically good. It isn't.

Bitcoin is not free to process. As noted in my comment, they would need to at some point exchange it to USD (or whatever) to pay their suppliers, which introduces an exchange rate spread and fees. They would also still need to maintain banking facilities for this normal currency.
Additionally, two other points that are salient:
* The card networks, because of the economies of scale involved in a site such as Amazon, deep discount the price charged for their merchant acquiring (the same as most large businesses like supermarkets or chains). While the merchant acquirer might charge a small business 2% plus a flat fee for credit card transactions, it's entirely possible for Amazon to negotiate a lower price, reducing any potential benefit for Bitcoin or actually making Bitcoin more expensive (especially since, given the low number of Bitcoin users, there are no real economies of scale as such - Amazon is so mass market, the percentage of their customers who would pay with Bitcoin is exceptionally low)
* There is no chargeback scheme on Bitcoin. This puts consumers at a significant detriment, since they have no means to dispute transactions where the goods are not delivered or are damaged whereas those paying with Visa or MasterCard have the right to (especially true in the UK, where the card provider is as liable for breach of contract as the merchant in the event of a dispute.)

Comparing economic policy to home finance is an automatic logic fail, as far as I'm concerned. Especially since the debt the government is creating, given the low bond rates at present, costs less than the rate of inflation, thus it *shrinks in value*, which credit card debt doesn't. If you could borrow money at a rate that meant the debt shrank in real terms and therefore cost you less to pay back than the amount you actually borrowed, you would be an absolute idiot not to take advantage.


Yeah, that's happening, obviously, people are running like fuck from the world's largest economy.


That much is obvious, since QE involves government bonds being purchased in the public market. So basically, your point is that QE exists. And?

No it isn't. It may deplete the value of wealth over time, but it is not a levy. A levy is another word for tax; money taken off you by the Government for use by the Government. Inflation isn't actually money taken off of you and the Government does not get to use the value of your wealth that inflation has eroded. It is not a levy, or a tax.

Kindly look at the links in the sidebar of this subreddit, which links to such obviously communist subs as and If anyone has linked Bitcoin and libertarianism, it is those libertarians who have used Bitcoin as a means of pushing their ideology, or as an expression of it.

Much of this is either factually incorrect or only technically true. Preference shareholders are paid before any other creditors, for a start - if you are using individual shares for consistent income, they will often be a choice used, for a start, so "stockholders last" simply doesn't apply in that case (and "executives" don't feature as creditors in any sense unless they are shareholders, and ordinary shareholders are paid last in the event a company is wound up anyway). Bonds can be defaulted, but many are issued with security. "Worthless currency", again, technically true, but by that I presume you mean the US dollar, a currency which has, historically, an extremely stable value and is at currently very low inflation rates historically speaking. And mutual funds can go south, true, but there are very strong incentives on their part to not allow this to happen - they will lose out too, and can adjust shareholdings etc to ensure it doesn't. Also, in some jurisdictions (definitely mine, not sure about the US) there are compensation schemes in place to compensate consumers in case of the insolvency of a regulated investment fund.
The key issue we have here though is that *Bitcoin solves none of these problems* and introduces new ones or makes them worse. If the value if Bitcoin crashes, nobody gets paid at all. If an exchange goes down and it has your Bitcoin, tough shit, you've lost it. If the value of Bitcoin goes down dramatically and you get paid in it, again, tough shit. If someone hacks your wallet and takes all your Bitcoin, tough shit. These sorts of things are easy to say "well, these things happen, that's just the market" to until they happen to you.
Bitcoin also introduces its own problem in that it is *completely unsuitable* for the purpose of saving for retirement. It has no income from interest or dividends - any gains you make on it will be capital gains, and therefore volatile. The whole point of using investment funds to save for retirement, I will reiterate, is to ensure a *consistent* level of *returns* to outpace inflation in a way that cash deposits cannot. Not "massive", not "enough to outpace all other investments so you have all the moneyz", "consistent". Your capital gains on Bitcoin may outpace inflation on US dollars or whatever currency your country uses, and therefore you may "win" - who knows. But in terms of sound financial planning *now*, it would still be pisspoor. With how volatile it is now, it would be a gamble. It would be like putting all your money into penny stocks.

Hilarious isn't it? It's not even like the US Mint has any role in managing currency or economic matters at all, the US Mint's main job is to *mint coins*.

No, that means the US must borrow *money* by issuing bonds. It does not necessarily mean QE, it means the issuance of bonds, some of which might be purchased as part of a QE programme, some of which might not.
It also doesn't mean the bonds aren't paid back, because they are, on their expiration date, which you keep dancing around because you don't want to admit that they are.


Nonsense. Literally, this makes no sense. Bonds are issued by the Treasury; money is printed by the Federal Reserve. Your suggestion is that the Treasury prints money to pay back the bonds it has to. It doesn't. It can't. It may borrow more money, but this doesn't mean *printing* money in any way, shape or form, unless you want to call the Fed buying Treasury bonds with printed money "the Treasury printing money", which is patently fucking stupid.


I didn't say he had none of the blame. I said that the financial crisis, which has led to greater deficits, the implementation of QE etc etc etc, was the fault of Bush (or, at the very least, not the fault of Obama, who was not actually president at the time the crisis hit). Any deficits themselves may be the "fault" of Obama, but they were incurred in order to sort out the crisis that Bush (or, again, at the very least governments before Obama's) caused. I would also be inclined to point out that the US government deficit is not $5trillion, it is $1.2trillion.
I am also, as I mentioned before, not American. So I'm not sure what propaganda I'm supposed to be buying here, other than by assuming that Obama doesn't have a magical time machine which he used to go back in time and fuck the world economy up for funzies.

I don't know the finer points of US tax law (I'm not American) but double taxation makes sense in a way (at least from my jurisdiction's point of view, which may or may not coincide with the US'). This is not helped by Bitcoins being "defined" as a currency/monetary unit but currently acting as and largely treated as a commodity, like a held stock.
If considered money, mined Bitcoins could be considered income - they are money, you did not have them before, you have them now, therefore you could (again, in my jurisdiction) be liable to income tax on them, despite the fact that they more or less came from nowhere. But given how they are not legally defined as money and indeed act in a very similar manner to stocks at this point, they would be considered assets and potentially, on selling them, you might have realised a capital gain, and so could be liable to capital gains tax. The really worrying bit for miners however is that since you hadn't actually paid anything for them directly, things get sticky, since technically your capital gain is 100% of the value they are sold for, as you "bought" them at $0.00 and sold them at $however much, and you would therefore be liable for CGT at CGTrate% * the entire sale value. The traded value for the Bitcoin at the time it was mined is totally irrelevant, what matters is what *you* paid for the Bitcoin, and you paid nothing (hypothetical example: you buy a share at $2, the stock market quote for it at that point is $20, you sell it at that point, you've made no capital gain and are therefore exempt right, right? Wrong, you've made a capital gain of $18, which will be taxed at whatever your CGT rate is. CGT is concerned with your *actual* gain, not any hypothetical gain based on what other people are being charged.)
It's very untested waters, and I would personally be extremely cautious before investing anything in such a thing at this point. Tax laws are not set up for something which not only springs into existence from nothing at all but is not also readily definable as anything that already exists.

So I should convince someone who has adopted the position that anything other than Bitcoin is "counterfeited" "trash", an insanely unreasonable position by any stretch, that it is in fact not? How about you justify your position, which is by far a minority one? And, yes, is inflammatory. Even if you take the position that Bitcoin is better than "fiat" (Bitcoin is still fiat currency by most definitions) there are better ways to structure an argument than to call everything else counterfeited trash.
Or even better yet, how about we forget that, because it's an irrelevant diversion from the actual topic of discussion, and move on to how a lot of people will want a mortgage for reasons other than inflated house prices, and moving to a Bitcoin-based economy would lead to them being unable to do so. Ergo, reduced consumer choice.

No it isn't. It really really isn't.
In a regulated environment like finance, how you describe an investment product is not "semantics". It is illegal to mislead people. It is illegal to lie to people. It is illegal to tell people they are buying one thing when they are buying another. It is not fair dealing.
I'm not meaning to be harsh, but please bear in mind that in the real world, outside of the unregulated Bitcoin marketplace, you CANNOT make false claims about financial products and expect to get away with it, and being sold an "exchange traded fund" that is "unlisted" and therefore cannot be sold on an exchange is, if not expressly false, extremely misleading.
@_date: 2013-12-29 22:03:18
Mt. Gox is an exchange, not a bank. A bank would (in the simplest possible sense) accept deposits and make loans and provide financial services such as debit cards and payments, perhaps performing other services (such as currency exchange) on the side. Mt. Gox does none of these things bar currency exchange. It's not even clear if such a thing as banks do now (fractional reserve) is possible in Bitcoin. Quite possibly it is, but the lack of a lender of last resort or any kind of regulation makes it insanely risky for all concerned.
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:01:41
No, no it isn't. Short selling is entering an agreement to sell a security or commodity you do not actually own. Short selling would be agreeing to sell someone 1BTC for $1000 in a week and hoping the price crashes to half that in the meantime so you can buy 1BTC for $500 and make a quick profit. (Of course half the problem with Bitcoin is that it's not at all regulated, is easily manipulated and is exceptionally volatile; if short positions in Bitcoin were even possible it's most likely someone with large holdings could and would nuke the whole thing for profit.)

Sounds about right to me.
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:09:53
Right. This is the tipping point.
Throughout history, there has been time after time after time when unregulated businesses have wrought havoc on people. The people have been sold things they didn't understand; they were sold things that were too risky for them; they were sold things that didn't make sense. Firms took advantage of naive people, of stupid people, of all sorts of people. They used their dominant position in order to create trusts and cartels and to destabilise the economy. We, as a people, as a nation, as a whatever, clamoured for and created regulations in order to stop this from happening. You cannot give someone financial advice without being accredited and liable for it; you cannot sell someone a financial product that is absurdly risky when they want no risk at all or can't understand the risk they're taking on. These regulations are *good*, they are common sense, basic provisions to ensure that in a mostly-free market place people are not taken advantage of, that the market place runs smoothly, that people are not just thrown to the predatory wolves looking to flog the average person whatever makes them the most money. We have seen examples, TIME AND TIME AGAIN, where a lack of regulation has been shown to be deleterious to market outcomes, to the wealth of individual people, to EVERYONE, where the push to remove regulations has led to nothing but poorer outcomes for all concerned. We have regulations on investments, stock trading, currencies, markets, all of these things because they STOP PEOPLE BEING RIPPED OFF, and because they are necessary to run a stable, decent marketplace.
You and the rest of the libertarian cretins who have taken what would have been an amazing idea for a crypto-currency, which is technically impressive, and turned it into an ideological Randroid wankfest devoid, ironically, of any reason, have been trumpeting Bitcoin's lack of regulation as the most stunning example of why it should succeed. This position is one that can only come without even the slightest understanding of why financial markets, banks and other financial businesses are regulated, and from being perched an ivory tower where you yourself will not suffer from the lack of regulation. Your very solution boils down to "if someone gets ripped off, fuck 'em", and it's a lovely idea right up until the point when you're the one getting fucked, and it assumes that everyone has perfect information and nobody is deliberately misled, nobody is drawn towards things too risky for them and nobody is told that there's a guaranteed profit waiting for them if they just invest in BTC or LTC or XYZ.
We do not live in that world. We live in a world where people will do all sorts of horrible things to people with the aim of making a quick buck. *THAT IS WHY WE HAVE REGULATIONS.* Because EVERY ATTEMPT at a totally unregulated market has ended in ruin and misery. People here think that Bitcoin is somehow different and special in that regard and they are WRONG, and they will continue to be wrong as long as human nature exists.
Look how well no regulations has served Bitcoin. It has become a haven for money launderers and criminals who can use it psuedo-anonymously to launder their gains from crimes - not even just drug dealing, from fraud committed against average people, from any crime you could care to think of. It has become a laughing stock because its value fluctuates so ridiculously that its usage as a mainstream currency is untenable, fuelled by the pump and dump activity seen so often - exhortations to buy into Bitcoin because "it will only ever go up" and there is a profit to be made, to put money into it because it's safe, safer than the "fiat" that people talk about disparagingly but that, at the end of the day, is still more trustworthy than this.
Go and read up on Standard Oil, and how it had people over a barrel because there were no regulations that prevented them from monopolising the oil market and squeezing their competitors out of business. Go and read up on the status of US banks before the Fed was created, and the multiple bank crises. Fuck, go and read up on the financial crisis just passed, and how the universal reaction has been to regulate more, to make sure that the loopholes that were used and which destabilised the world's economic system were closed such that they could be never used again.
You won't listen. You'll come back with more deluded libertarian bullshit. about how being free to be ripped off is real freedom. That's fine; be wilfully ignorant. I know that I'm on the right side of history, and that until Bitcoin's community accepts the fact that a complete lack of regulation has been proven untenable many, many, many times over, it will be a laughing stock.

All granted. The problem is I do not have the time or the resources to find relevant discussions for every single talking point and refute it at length, and even if I did chances are I'd be downvoted anyway if it went against the pro-Bitcoin or libertarian majority on here (as has happened when I've made some more thoughtful posts on here) making my effort completely pointless. I'll do so on economic or financial concepts, which I know a good amount about, but for most things it's far simpler and less harmful to my sanity to just very bluntly state what the supposed argument is in a way that makes it clear why it's stupid, hopefully in a somewhat amusing way.


Probably not. But then I take the view that for a lot of people here their minds won't be changed. You can present them with hard facts that disprove what they're saying and they'll immediately switch to a different talking point or come back with more nonsense. It's rather depressing.


I don't know if he's trying to "work out" Bitcoin as such. I think he understands it well enough, but he's taken the view that it's unworkable, or a Bad Thing. Either way, it doesn't make him worse than Hitler as a lot of people seem to think.

If you have me pegged as a libertarian, trust me, you are wrong. I'd agree with that though.
It's still an astonishingly unlikely conspiracy theory. Bitcoin is simply not that much of a threat to traditional banks and never has been, for a whole variety of different reasons. It would be far more likely for enterprising banks to *participate* in the market and therefore make a profit from it, surely?


Again, there are a number of Bitcoin users who do so because of libertarian political leanings or ideology. They may not be so easily bought out as those who are merely in for a get rich quick scheme.
It would be perfectly rational - what I'm saying is that it is unlikely to happen. It presupposes a lot of things, like banks being opposed to Bitcoin on some sort of principle and wanting to destroy it, which there is at best limited and circumstantial proof of (e.g. banks not wanting to bank businesses who buy and sell Bitcoin being touted as an example of them hating it; rather more easily understood as a pragmatic move to not associate with businesses who pose a money laundering, reputational or fraud risk to them.)

The basic aim of the talking points thing is to point out things that aren't good reasoning, or rather notably bad reasoning that keeps getting parroted on here as part of the circlejerk (hence, talking point). If someone actually has cogent arguments and doesn't resort to ignorant nonsense or just wittering about "statists" and such like I'm quite happy to debate with them, but just going "HUR HUR KRUGMAN SED INTERNET WUZ STUPID" adds absolutely nothing. It's technically correct, but also totally irrelevant.
I'm sure if you asked Krugman about that quote now he'd cringe his face inside out and say he was wrong, but instead beats him over the head with it and assumes that because he made one idiotic prediction over 15 years ago, everything else he says that has even a tangential relationship to the Internet is completely invalid; that or repeatedly asserts that to make themselves feel better or to handwave away some of Krugman's valid misgivings about Bitcoin.

"Anyone on the fence or considering owning BTC" is not who I'm talking about here. I said "most consumers". Average John or Jane Doe, the vast majority of people, have absolutely no reason to consider using Bitcoin and couldn't care less. Target accepting it or Amazon accepting it does not change that - it just makes it easier for people who have or want Bitcoin for some reason.
You are looking at things from the perspective of someone who thinks Bitcoin is a wonderful idea. Think about it from the perspective of someone who just sees money as a means to an end, to buy their daily shopping, pay their bills and make the occasional bigger purchase. Bitcoin offers them the ability to do nothing they can't already do with their existing money.

Complete and total fucking nonsense, not helped by you either not understanding what yield is or just plain using the same term to refer to two entirely different things.
Interest rate / price = yield. Price is the current market price. Interest rate (aka coupon) is fixed. Rate is at 2% with a price of $100 par, yield is 2%. Rate is at 3% with a price of $100 par, yield is 3%. Price goes up, yield goes down; coupon goes up, yield goes up.
You will never get a bond where "the yield climbs up high" but simultaneously the bond will be at a "more expensive price" because the price, as you correctly state, moves inversely against the yield - cheaper bond means greater capital growth.


No, that would be the price, not the yield. Although one affects the other, the yield is completely separate and is strictly a measure of overall returns.
But this is by the by, since anyone who thinks the US government is anywhere near defaulting on their debts (bar the actions of lunatic Teabaggers) is smoking crack.

On *Bitcoin*, sure - I've not actually seen that happening en masse, but I'll take your word for it. I would be surprised if this "research" they were directed to was anything other than Bitcoin FAQs and such written by Bitcoin enthusiasts, who also have a vested interest.
This certainly does not extend to political or economic concepts, where complete horseshit is upvoted, again because it fits the narrative (such as an argument I had recently with someone who insisted that Treasury bonds, as in the individual bonds themselves, aren't paid back, which is simply rubbish, but it sounds nice to debt hawks and such - it was, in fairness, downvoted after I called the person in question a cretin and explained why) and anyone who challenges it is downvoted.

I'm not sure this would assist Bitcoin in being a currency. It would assist Bitcoin in being a stock-like commodity, only without an actual commodity.
You cannot have both. You can either have Bitcoin be a currency used for general purchasing, or you can have it be something used as an investment vehicle. The two ends oppose each other. Dominant use as an investment reduces liquidity for those using it as a currency, and encourages deflation. Dominant use as a currency has the inverse effects.

That is a valid point (which, frankly, is a rare sight on here), but it's entirely theoretical and relies upon the USD becoming subject to Weimar-style amounts of inflation while BTC becomes more stable, which is if not impossible per se extremely improbable.
There is also the rather more important issue that if the reserve currency of the world and the legal tender of the world's largest economy becomes valueless overnight, the problems you would immediately face will be more adequately hedged against by stockpiling food and guns than money that requires electricity to function (and I say this as someone who finds survivalists ridiculous.)

No, but the dictionary provides the *generally accepted definition* of what words mean, and the word "fiat" in relation to currency does not mean what you want it to mean. It would be convenient to you if it did,  because then that would match your ideology, but it doesn't.




Yes. In fact, that quote was from Wikipedia. Go update and add to it if you want. But you will, at some point, have to come to the inescapable conclusion that you can't just remove the other two senses of the word "fiat" just because it would include Bitcoin.
You COULD adapt your ideology to reality and realise that Bitcoin really is a fiat currency because it has no intrinsic value in and of itself, being perhaps the purest example of a currency being solely a medium of value exchange. But then that would require ditching the rhetoric.

Yup, I don't agree it's an amazing panacea so obviously I must be ignorant of it!
Always nice to see the same talking point of "these places take Bitcoin so therefore it can be used for basic living expenses!" A few isolated cases of people being able to pay rent, bills and food with Bitcoin does not change the fact that 99.999999% of people have to use dollars, pounds, Euros or whatever. I cannot go to Tesco and buy a weekly shop with Bitcoins, other than by buying gift cards which defeats the purpose of it and brings to mind why I'd exchange real money for Internet money which I then exchange for a card containing a representation of real money which does the same thing only less well. My water and electricity companies won't take Bitcoin, and neither will my ISP or mobile phone company. Virtually nobody can pay their rent with Bitcoins.

NO THEY ARE NOT. They are not "anologous" to ETFs because they are not accredited and regulated in the same way. The only way they are remotely similar is the fact that they are both "funds". To claim they are "anologous" is simply blatant lies.


I did, I have grabbed a beer, and about 6 shots of JD, which is why I'm responding in less temperate terms than earlier. Words mean things. You cannot just say one thing is another thing without some fucking backing behind it, not when people are going to be putting their actual money on the line.
Frankly, and this is not you personally by any stretch, this is symptomatic of a whole culture I've seen in the Bitcoin community, of thinking the whole finance sector should work by their rules of caveat emptor, and it's the rules that need to change, when simply those rules are in place to protect people, even if it means they have to describe thier beloved currency/commodity/whatever in realistic and non-positive terms. Until the Bitcoin community as a whole understands that their clamour for no regulation is allowing for people to be sold things that aren't what they're claimed to be in this way, they will be regarded as nothing more than an amusing diversion or a collection of cranks.
