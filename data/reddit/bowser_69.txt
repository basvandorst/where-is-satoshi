If you're using electrum try restarting the program.

I enjoyed the read.
Several positive key points in bitcoins life cycle. 
@_date: 2015-06-11 07:01:52
Yeah of course i can do that for you. It's always available here in TW. What's the problem you have in your area?
@_date: 2015-06-11 09:51:48
I'm not sure the limit, but i know i spent 7100 NTD to get 1 btc and the clerk didn't seem to care or think it was a problem. I think the bitoex is a large exchange for asia.

I believe it's a one way street unfortunately. I will check with my Taiwanese wife about this to confirm.
@_date: 2015-06-17 16:31:24
Wouldn't the increased sell price of btc offset the miners reduced reward?
@_date: 2015-06-11 03:49:39
I'm currently in Taiwan, I can confirm the family mart FAMIPORT"s are everywhere.,   I've purchased a BTC from the famiports to test the system, it's quite cool.
@_date: 2015-06-16 10:35:04
I read something similar to this earlier, I've since purchased a vps and installed a node. 
Max connections at 1000. Currently at 39.
Do I feel bad about my out of pocket expense? Not really, because I want to contribute to bitcoin, I'm not a coder or a store merchant, this is my way to help btc grow.

Screenshot current state. 
It will be interesting to come back to this in a couple years. Perhaps the world will be lit up.

I think coin base is good. It has a Vault storage, some security features include, multisig, 2fa, group control, 48 hour release. 
@_date: 2015-05-31 05:05:30
Coinbase Vault seems secure.  Multi sig,  2fa, 48 hour timed release.  
I don't trust myself enough for cold storage. 
@_date: 2016-06-04 04:25:18
I said this because it looks like a typical PnD. A group of insiders or investers pump the market and cause a hype, btc value sky rockets. What happens when they pull out their 2bn btc investments?
@_date: 2016-06-04 04:22:04


If you look at volume per exchange you can see. OKCoin Houbi and a couple others are china exchanges.
@_date: 2016-06-25 14:12:17
I purchase btc from family mart on a regular basis. 
Also I follow bitcoin house Taiwan on OpenBazaar.
@_date: 2016-06-23 05:33:56
I've been running a store for several weeks now. 
I've had one issue with a buyer but was resolved easily with the moderator.
Looking forward to ob2.0
@_date: 2016-06-03 18:45:29
I agree that this may be caused by the upcoming having. However I am concerned at the market volume, almost the entire run can be attributed to china pumping in  over 1bn.
It seems fishy and I wouldn't be surprised this is just manipulation.
@_date: 2016-06-04 14:56:47


Also never keep funds in exchanges. Other alternatives to buying btc is available aswell localbitcoins for example. After that, tumbler services + tor is there. It's not difficult to obfuscate btc use.
@_date: 2016-06-04 13:30:05
I'm talking about the recent price rise of over $120usd. If you look at the btc markets you can clearly see over 1.2bn has been attributed specifically to chinese exchanges. 
Two weeks ago the market cap was hovering around 6.9bn and 7bn mark. Now we are over 8.2bn. 
This is certainly chinese investers pumping btc. I'm not sure if they are playing a long game or planning to dump. 
@_date: 2016-06-03 18:35:06
Take a look at the btc markets, we can see huge amounts of cash flowing in from China.  Over 1bn.
What happens when china dumps?
@_date: 2016-06-04 17:53:45
Are you able to give any insight in the recent Chinese btc pump of almost 2.5b USD?
Is it due to Chinese government capital control? Or perhaps Chinese have decided btc is a good hedge against the falling yuan?
@_date: 2016-06-03 18:53:49
I want my second back.
@_date: 2015-08-14 14:03:48
Yes that's true about security, however you can use pgp to encrypt anything you need. 
No reason not to store on cloud with the tools like pgp available today.

$420k ...lol fucking snoop.

Man I just reinstalled Spotify and was depressed to find no btc pay option. I even looked for through gyft.
@_date: 2015-07-21 18:55:16
Wow, this could be amazing. Downloading now.
@_date: 2015-07-11 14:25:29
I watched this on my flight to hong Kong, was very surprised to see this.
Nice capture.

What's insight block explorer and why do you run it on your node?
I have a node on a VPS and will cancel it soon to run my own in my home with one of these brix systems.
@_date: 2015-07-12 04:49:13
Every time I buy anything online I first look for what I want, then try and find a retailer that accepts btc. If they don't I file a polite suggestion into their system.
I would like to eventually use btc for everything, never having to covert to fiat.  
@_date: 2015-07-01 08:08:13
Sounds like a great idea.
Transparent prize pool and transactions. 
Players don't have to dick around with PayPal. 
I ran a team many years ago and ended fronting some of my players buy ins because no bank account or PayPal.
I wish btc was around before my reactions slowed to a snails pace :)
@_date: 2015-07-11 18:13:37
I admire your strength.

My wife just said I stink, I need btc to buy deodorant.
@_date: 2015-07-16 12:49:21
I don't know why you were downvoted. Good idea.
@_date: 2015-07-18 09:31:30
This is cool. 
Is there a node monitoring app you can use? Something that displays live transactions ect.
@_date: 2015-07-07 04:01:16
In my time I've noticed a few things that relate to this. People always react  negatively to change, especially something as disruptive as bitcoin. 
They resist and mock it before it gets adopted. 
The freshest example I can recall is the media's reaction to google fiber. When it was first launched I was listening to fox news and they were so fucking negative about fiber, saying it will never succeed, people don't need those speed's ect.. It was depressing to watch.
  People aren't idiots, fiber is widely accepted and everyone wants it. I think bitcoin will be the same way, in a couple years everyone won't think twice about bitcoin and how much it has benefited society.

Were you trying to save a couple of cents on your TX fee?
@_date: 2016-09-04 04:28:52
Yay, time to spend some money.
@_date: 2016-05-30 17:36:52
I'm cautiously waiting for China to dump, then watch price correct.
Or to the moon.

I use this for the most up to date checks. Also bitfinex has an app.

Shortly after the halvening we will experience the dumpenining. 
Months after the dumpening we will see a new ATH.

This guy was telling everyone to buy bitcoin during the long bear market (250 USD) . He probably isn't just a hype bot and knows what he's doing.
