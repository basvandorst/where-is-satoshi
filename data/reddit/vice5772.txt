When bitcoin starts going up, expect delays on all transfers and exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:24:05
They're going through some major growing pains. If bitcoin goes over $20K anytime soon, expect even more growing pains and more delays.
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:30:47
"muh bubble."
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:15:10
Just an attempt to create doubt so the article author can buy bitcoin at a lower price.
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:12:19
That's when you buy more bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:11:18
These network fees are going to hurt bitcoin in addition to what's already happened this week.
@_date: 2018-05-18 00:02:43
Technical analysis saved me a lot of money from these recent drops
@_date: 2018-05-17 23:12:03
Superstition and Bitcoin don't work
@_date: 2018-05-25 01:40:20
All that money that leaves the market will eventually FOMO back in
@_date: 2018-05-18 00:36:19
100% so far for me. Bitcoin will hit 7800 tomorrow morning
@_date: 2018-06-08 16:40:35
Bitcoin is about to triple test the 7800 wall and OP is whining because it's not 10K yet. Fuck, one thing at a time.
@_date: 2018-06-08 11:16:11
This is what happens when you get rejected by a major sell wall twice in a row
@_date: 2018-06-08 17:00:49
Well, you remember the beginning of the last bull run? that giant leap from 6500. That is exactly what will happen when people are at their most bitter, sad, or angry towards Bitcoin. The bull run is going to start with a bang and you're damn right the FOMO crew will be there to push it above 10K.
@_date: 2019-02-04 19:43:25
@_date: 2018-03-30 01:25:46
Whoa, are we getting close to the buy-in price already?
@_date: 2018-03-30 05:46:39
I knew when BTC/USDT hit 6666.66, that was going to be the new bottom.
@_date: 2018-03-26 18:08:56
Wouldn't surprise me if it's LTC's turn to lose some major satoshis like Ethereum has in the last few months
@_date: 2018-03-30 03:44:50
Target is 100 million satoshis
@_date: 2018-03-30 03:48:42
That rock's name? Albert Einstein.
@_date: 2018-03-30 02:30:13
Get a better username to troll with. Edgy anti-feminist nihilist is so 2015. Also, stop trolling the exact opposite of a subreddit, it's not convincing. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:58:52
75 is the new 25 these days anyhow.
@_date: 2018-03-30 01:37:27
I bought in early storm coin and ncash. Not too worried
@_date: 2018-03-29 22:51:24
I was trading with ETH pairs until a couple weeks ago. I can't stand holding a coin that constantly sheds btc value
@_date: 2018-03-30 02:57:32
Damn, should I cancel my direct deposit to Binance? 
@_date: 2018-03-30 01:50:58
It's important not to mix up your financial investments with your emotional investments. It's like toothpaste and Orange juice.
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:42:23
Eh, my coins are doing ok even if it dips below 7k.
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:56:27
When I trade, I only care about gaining satoshis. The dollars will come later.
@_date: 2018-03-30 23:53:56
You have to take everything said on Reddit with a grain of salt or it's going to turn you into a nihilistic troll
@_date: 2018-03-30 06:08:43
For now it's easier, but blockchain technology is going to catch up and become more user friendly. Right now many cryptocurrencies are forming partnerships with companies that will inevitably lead to a faster more cost effective way of paying for things.
@_date: 2018-03-30 01:56:28
I don't think any daytrader would fault you for holding tether. Still a great risk to hold tether below 7k, but hey it paid off, that's what daytrading is about.
@_date: 2018-03-30 22:35:53
Difficulty decreases when people stop mining due to profit loss. Then profits go up, then more miners come back. Rinse repeat.
@_date: 2018-03-30 22:41:22
Damn man, who pissed in your cheerios?
@_date: 2018-03-30 22:37:26
Gemini is a good one
@_date: 2018-03-30 02:09:09
Only thing seizing around here is your troll effort. Try being less obvious and less "savage" like some Jake Pauler.
@_date: 2018-03-30 02:20:21
Isn't it great when people buy the top and sell the bottom and then let us all know how frequently it happens? Gives me hope for the future
@_date: 2018-03-30 05:54:59


When you buy something off Amazon, you are going through at LEAST 3 middlemen to purchase the item: Amazon, Mastercard/Visa and your bank. With crypto it's more direct with no middlemen and less companies will be skimming off the top of your purchase.
@_date: 2018-03-30 23:01:57
Yeah, but I think there's still an even enough ebb and flow that it doesn't cause too many problems. We're definitely in a state now where the miner market is very saturated(especially with ASICs). It's kinda like how Uber incentivizes drivers.
@_date: 2018-02-11 23:32:38
People downvoted you, but you're already half-right.
@_date: 2018-03-30 22:39:34
Used to be ads on Reddit for the bitcoin subreddit. Been a while since I've seen it though 
@_date: 2018-04-01 18:46:19
Actually, I think we're going to get Sideshow Bob'd 
@_date: 2018-04-24 08:37:21
Not as much market shortage, bitcoin slowly and sustainably gaining and more discussion about bitcoin in media.
@_date: 2018-04-01 18:21:43
No one called anything. Hindsight makes everyone look like a fucking expert.
@_date: 2018-04-03 00:38:54
If you had any idea where the bottom was, you wouldn't be making youtube videos.
@_date: 2018-04-01 16:36:41
It was one big bear trap
@_date: 2018-04-01 16:17:48
The lower the market goes, the less money(within reason) I have in my bank account. So I think banks lose either way. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 08:25:53
We're in the optimistic stage of a global pump and dump.
@_date: 2018-04-01 15:44:25
Yeah, sometimes people cancel their large buy orders at just the right time
@_date: 2018-04-01 18:20:15
Thank you for your sacrifice.
