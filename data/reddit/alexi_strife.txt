Hi, I sent you my info via your google doc, but here is the short of my story. 
I've been casually in and out of BTC for a year now. The first time I bought in, it was via bitinstant. 13 coins at $10 a piece   , I really felt like I was just throwing my cash away but 30 minutes later I had coins in my account. Since then I've been going with Bitinstant since it's the easiest route once you get used to the process. I've tried coinbase but my bank freezes my entire account every time I try to set up access for them to withdraw money for coins. 
I tried to use BitInstant -&gt; MyGox recently and since I had changed my password within the past few days, I got locked out of my gox account for a day and couldn't access the coins I just bought. I guess that's a good security feature, it was just unexpected and put a hitch in my plans. 
I've also gotten several other people into BTC and walked them through the process of Bitinstant. They all remark how complicated it sounds but then after going through the process, tell me it's quite easy actually (except for finding a moneygram in San Francisco can be almost impossible since their map hasn't been updated in forever).

It's updating and synching you with the network. It did that for me too. It's loading everything from the blockchain which takes awhile (like about an hour for me).

Keep transactions small, have user ratings and make it function like (as cheesy as this sounds) the okcupid mobile app. That app alerts you when other users are near, could make something like that.

There have been multiple cases with varying levels of evidence, but the most recent was Michael Hastings. Since the NSA is in control of pretty much the entire narrative of the story, it's difficult to get hard facts because the government isn't going to outright admit to killing him, but the story is pretty damming. 
Of course this is just "conspiracy tin foil hatlol" stuff. But so was the NSA before the leaks made the press. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 23:12:37
Firstly, we would need to figure out a fast and efficient BTC register or POS system. Something where you basically just punched in the amount total and it either generated a QR code or you could tap your NFC device on it to pay. I prefer the latter because it just seems quicker to me but I could be wrong. Honestly, I was thinking of setting up two CoinBase accounts (one for each register) and just using their app. But if there is something better, I'm open to it. But also remember, this is a bar... lots of liquid flying around which may not play nice with a tablet. 
Secondly, Well... tips. Tipping is just part of the American bar culture and we'd have to figure out a way to incorporate that. Maybe have QR codes printed out on back lit plastic sign holders?
I'd also need staff for the event to help out. Not much, just a few people to possibly help the bartenders/club staff in case a problem comes up with a transaction. 
Then we need talent/entertainment and of course, customers.

Having lost about 10 btc to blackjack on that site to card draws that are, as close as I can tell, fucking impossible, I have found it very fishy as well. I'm no stat magician, but I'm pretty sure that with four decks the possibility of the dealer getting ten blackjacks in a row is impossible. 
Even playing with the winning strats from here ( the same strat I actually won $200 in vegas with off the video machines, you end up losing with on that site. 
One pattern I noticed with this site is your chances of continuing to win are higher if you keep cashing out every few hands/spins/whatever. Immediately after you have a "good luck streak", run. 
I also had quite a few statistically impossible happenings on satoshi circle that made me question it (15 losses in a row on the 50/50 circle? kinda suspicious). If you'd like to hear out my strats and experiences on that site as well, let me know.

The fact that there is no limited amount of USD means that the more people who try to use it to store wealth, the more we will have to print and the price will skyrocket because liquidity will vanish.

It will send from both, technically. 
All your wallet is, is an address. You can send/recieve from that address no matter what as long as you have it on a client(or service like blockchain.info) that has it decrypted. It won't double spend because the entire network knows your PayFrom and PayTo addresses, so you can log into it from anywhere that has your personal wallet info. 
@_date: 2013-05-10 02:36:54
It's sad that this fact (7. There will only be about 21 million Bitcoins made. That number will be reached in 2140.) is listed without further explanation of how BTC's value is divisible.

Let me make this very clear. Neither do I. I, personally, do not agree at all with taking the lives of others. Especially just to "shut them up". It's not something you do. But life is complicated, and there is no black and white, only grey. We like to draw these abstract lines of morality every time a news story breaks but there is a thought process in making these choices that we'll never; hopefully, know. 
If he did order the hit, one thing is for sure, he did it because the needs of the many outweighed the needs of the few. The person in question was threatening his user base, a group of people who were more than just a bottom dollar to him. From all we've read, his user base were more than just money, they represented his ideal future. 
But it stills goes against his narrative with the site. He was against violence. He removed firearm sales for that very reason and for a period, there was talks on the forums about them removing devil's breath after the Vice article hit the news stream. He was a very IT minded person with deep roots in the black hat side of things, why not just dox the accuser and then let "nature" take care of them? Why not make it public that this vendor, a threat to your entire business scheme, is threatening to reveal all your customer data? It just doesn't add up.  
@_date: 2013-04-18 16:38:24
Pretty much, though copy isn't really the right word. It's more like there is two places for you to use one wallet through. 
BCinfo is basically just doing what the multibit client does but through a web browser instead of an app. It all connects to the same address. So if, though I hope not, Blockchain.info gets hacked and all the wallets are decrypted, which is highly unlikely if you used a good password, then they could still spend the money in those wallets.

Exactly. He even removed the sale of firearms because it didn't fit with the site's mission statement. 
If someone was trying to extort him with threats to reveal a large portion of his user base, he wouldn't have tried to have the guy killed, he would have doxed the user and then let nature take it's course. It just doesn't make sense. 
Also, this would HAVE to mean that statistically over 51% of "internet hitmen" are working for the government, which just doesn't sit right. Maybe I'm crazy, but with everything we have learned about the NSA recently, it seems more and more likely this was a set up because he was pissing in the face of the DEA and making the LE look foolish. 
They needed to make him a murderer, a real criminal, because otherwise he would have been seen as a martyr.

A year and a half or so ago, my girlfriend at the time had to switch doctors when we relocated. Her new doctor refused to refill her RX for her bipolar meds and instead insisted on switching her to an antidepressant that was previously shown to induce suicidal and violent tendencies in her. Not wanting to go down that path again, I researched where I could get her RX. I tried various online pharmacies but they all felt like scams, then I found SilkRoad. 
Strangely, the fact that it sold all manner of illicit materials and worked off of a rating/feedback system made it seem much more legit than any over seas source I found, so I took the leap and tried it. 
So yeah, internet drug dealers came through where doctors who suck you dry of insurance money, failed. 
Initially, I over bought the amount of BTC I needed and then forgot about it for a year. I came back to find it went from $6 to 75 and then on to our recent roller coaster. I've been heavily involved in buying/selling in the market since and trying to incorporate BTC in my day to day life.

As a new exchange, could I ask you one favor. Do you think you could put a warning banner on your site that informs people how keep their coins safe via cold storage, etc. No system is perfect, no matter how much you test, the ultimate security measure will be teaching your customers to be secure themselves.  
@_date: 2013-04-18 18:42:16
Go to blockchain.info and log in like you normally would. The site isn't live, so you will get a large error pop up but it should take you your wallet link (the page with the QR code). There should be a download backup link there.

Maybe even write to the current subway that takes bitcoin, show them some appreciation on their initiative and ask if you can use them as an example when you write your local chain asking if they will take it. If this guy already has it all figured out already, then you're one step closer to getting your local one's to accept it!

You SHOULD still be able to download your wallet data from their cloudflare backup and then import it into a multibit client and spend your BTC that way. Granted it might take awhile to download the blockchain data to your device, but it's better than nothing!

You say that, but really it is much more difficult/trouble than it seems for your average user. Hopefully, it won't be in the future. 
But yeah, you are right. There is no reason for keeping it at a third party, but one step at a time. We are getting a lot of adopters over the past few months, people who never had to think about these types of things because they didn't have to or knew those were options.

While they can't stop the currency, they can prosecute and indefinitely detain the "terrorists" that use it. 
Trying not to hyperbole, but I would not put it past the government to go to do that if BTC started threatening it's currency.

I'll definitely hit them up and try to pick their brains. IIRC, they printed out QR codes that people scanned to pay their tabs, which wouldn't fly too well here. 
I guess, what I would really want out of the POS would be something able to generate QR codes on a screen for paying but had no ability to transfer out funds. That way someone couldn't transfer the contents of the register somehow if the device was taken from the bar or something.
@_date: 2013-12-08 19:25:26
I was at some bitcoin event and there was a dude there showing off how much bitbling he had and bragging about how he's got a pocket full of cassius coins in his pocket. Must have had at least 30 btc on him. I never thought so hard about mugging someone until then. Not because it was a lot of money mind you, but because I would have gone down in history as the first dude who mugged someone for a crypto-currency.  
@_date: 2013-10-30 19:50:50
Even if it's not illegal,  it won't stop him from being targeted for suspicious activity.  Then they just have to go back through your record to find something illegal you did,  oh and they will, and then bamf.

I buy stuff with bitcoin. Mainly Foodler and gadgets from BitCoin store. Though I also do use it as a slot machine... mainly satoshi dice and blackjack. But that's um, different... 
As a side note, I'm trying to come up with a way to accept bitcoin at the bar I tend at. As of right now, I gladly accept my tips in BTC at the bar, but management is a lil sketchy of taking it as a payment until I can prove it's easy to use.
@_date: 2013-04-18 12:59:45
From an outsider perspective, his view was pretty balanced. If I wasn't willing to take a chance I would have not put anything into BTC. However, I did and it paid off, just like how for others it did not. 
I'm only disappointed because I wasn't expecting a comedy piece on BTC in the opening part of the show. I thought he was going to be the interview guest, maybe talk about the global economy, etc and then mention btc. Not just a minute poke and go at it. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 01:36:19
What about the 0.0005 btc transaction fees when processing payments? If the price got high enough (roughly $4000/btc that's kinda in moon orbit) your transaction fees using BTC would be the same as this unless the entire community decides to lower the transaction fee.

One argument I came across was this. "Bitcoin is too scarce. Eventually it will all be mined and there will be no coins left for anyone. Even if it's divisible you will run out eventually. The dollar can be divided into pennies, but that doesn't change the price of it."

While this story is anecdotal, let me tell you a tale. 
Back when BTC was at $50 and rising I got myself back into the community and was buying more and more from bitinstant (only real way to get it in the states back then). One day it was going "to the moon" toward $150ish out of no where, I ran to the nearest CVS to buy in more. There I ran into another guy using the moneygram service to deposit coins. We both we sending the same amount, $500. 
I said "bitcoin, right?" and he seemed very excited to talk to me about it and how he just got in. Said he was hoping this would really take off. Afterward we walked outside and talked about speculation and all that jazz and I was all "it's got no where to go but up, might have some pitfalls, but yeah!"
Over the next week we saw it go to around 200 and then crash back to $50. I felt terrible. Not only for what I presumed was a bad financial choice on my part, but because I felt bad for installing so much misplaced hope in that random dude.
I cut my losses and decided to say fuck it, gambled all my btc on satoshi dice, cursed the day Satoshi was born, and then went about my life. 
Yeah. Well. Hindsight is 20/20. Look at it now. 
You never know where tomorrow will lead, but if you invested in BTC just now, then don't even think about pulling out for months. Maybe even a few years. BTC has never been a short term get rich quick (in days) scheme, that's what opening up fake black market sites and running off with hundreds of drug users BTC is for.

Except that checks could bounce, thus the security (for the merchant) was't the same. There was an increased risk with accepting checks that was eliminted with the use of debit cards. I see the point you are trying to make, and I agree, but the example is kind of poor. 
@_date: 2013-05-13 02:39:21
As someone who was there for the BTC sushi event, a few words of wisdom from the process I've noticed. 
1. Have a good internet connection available! There was no wifi in the area when we tried to pay and our phone had terrible reception inside the store. We ended up having to go outside to pay. (thanks t-mobile)
2. For the love of Satoshi, have your QR code next to your register,  on your bill (preferably), or on the little black book things you use to hang the bill to people. 
3. Have a "tip bucket" address that is only for receiving tips. At the sushi night, it felt impossible to give a tip to the wait staff in BTC cause it was all just going to the same address.

It would be both to spread awareness and to help current investors/developers of BTC get experience and data on how to use BTC practically in an environment like this. If we want wide scale adoption, a lot of stuff has to be smoothed out.
I was thinking it would be essential to have some people there to do live exchanges for new people to play around with.

Yeap. The bitcoin network knows everyone's PayTo and PayFrom addresses, so it keeps track of where all the coins are going at any given time even if a major site like BC.info goes down. How this works is taking your encrypted wallet data from bc.info and using the client to function like the services provided by BC. 
When BC.info comes back up, your wallet will still work on their site and it will be synched with whatever transactions you did through the multibit client.
