This is an underestimated concern...however, a changing of the guard is ok, and the many will always overcome the few, or it will wipe us all out. The rich can’t be rich without the middle or the poor.

Imagine if everyone just tried to buy one single bitcoin....now multiple that by 10...god this currency is frighteningly new. With everything going on in the world, if I was displaced it brings me so much comfort no one can touch my bitcoin worth out knowing what I know, or having the information I have in my head (and hidden away in certain places). 
Bitcoin, change the world. Make us love each other again.

So it should be fine just to send as is, leave references out?

Haha I'm not sure if you kidding or not.

So essentially, SDR's are like bitcoin but the government would have total control over them. Almost like the anti-bitcoin. 
She believed that bitcoin could take her job, as the currency manages itself (no need for bankers). She was also quite adamant that VISA and MasterCard changed their business description from a payment processor to something else (I don't remember what), which actual could put them into the virtual currency world. 
I am going to go into battle with her tonight about her SDR's, which seem like an awful proposition. 
@_date: 2015-06-01 02:34:53
Haha I'm not sure if you kidding or not.

So he was involved during the numerous crashes Wall St has been involved in. I'm sure he has had his great days, but I will always be wary of those Wall Streeters who were around during those periods.
I don't believe "sound money" that is backed by gold even exists anymore, it seems to be about the size of the gun behind the money.
@_date: 2014-12-01 03:29:16
You are kidding right. Bitcoin does EXACTLY that, government can create more money at any time, Bitcoin is limited. If there was no need for third parties to accept bitcoin, there would be no need for money at all, as no one would need to trade....genius. 
Third parties exist to make life easier for us as humans to interact. The beauty of Bitcoin is that it takes away the evils government and banks can enforce on fiat currency. Do you really not see that?
@_date: 2014-11-10 16:35:06
Fees are non existent if you buy directly from the bank account. Companies like Mastercard and Visa charge fees, which is why circle must in this case! Directly from the account there are none! 
@_date: 2014-12-28 03:08:54
True! I see BitPay as the most simplistic way of incorporating Bitcoin into their system, as I am sure they will want to convert it into dollars to assure profitability. That is good though, I will need to focus on teachig what Bitcoin is! Thank you

Go right to circle.com if you want to buy them...no fees for buying the coins. 
Otherwise, keep commenting and supporting the cause!
Edit: if you buy from your bank account directly.
@_date: 2014-12-28 03:14:40
I appreciate that. I wonder what the best route regarding using a bank to manage these funds. 
@_date: 2014-11-13 05:33:28
Well with the evaluation Raoul Pal gave, there is still a possibility for a x2,000 increase in price...it clearly is a long way from being over. I am very excited to see how things change when companies such as Apple, Amazon and any large corporation uses it. Will they offer discounts for Bitcoin, what will Visa and MasterCard do? There are a lot of questions, and rise still to come! It is a very exciting time. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 02:27:20
You are right, but it is a store of value which is one of it's many advantages. I am just wondering for now, as I would love to only use Bitcoin, but that isn't feasible for everything all the time where I live right now.
@_date: 2014-11-30 20:40:18
This is not a begging community. We all have the ability to get Bitcoin, just like we all have the ability to obtain our governments form of money. 
@_date: 2014-12-07 07:10:36
Yes, I accidentally moved all my funds at once, so the money has left my original account, going into the new one...if that makes sense. 
@_date: 2014-11-30 21:20:04
I think you are missing the point here. The issue is being able to almost instantly exchange a certain, small amount of cash. Bitcoin does not have that yet, but I believe an idea will come. 
@_date: 2014-11-13 05:34:33
That is extremely kind of you. I really appreciate that.
@_date: 2014-12-07 07:11:43
Ha right...there has to be a change. It is never an issue when I don't move banks. Im not sure if you are a Bitcoin advocate or not!
@_date: 2014-11-30 21:16:53
I have been very smart with my money, which is why as a student I am able to invest at all. Thanks for the advice!
@_date: 2014-11-30 21:18:56
Nothing successful will ever succeed in a world where no 'institutions' are at least partly trustworthy. Would online shopping ever have survived without it? We need to start growing up and stop thinking every group trying to better this community is somehow 'out to get us', I am personally sick of it.
@_date: 2014-12-07 07:19:49
I'm guessing you mean Banks not Bitcoins in your first line. I think there is cause for Banks to disappear at some point. 
@_date: 2014-11-30 21:28:04
Which is why it is a fantastic method of payment, money transfer, and store of value. That has nothing to do with sending Bitcoin to buy items and the trust required there. It sounds like you want to have Bitcoin, and sit in a cave with your paper wallets. Bitcoin takes out the obscurity and lies surrounding money, it does not take away the need for people to be able to trade.

@_date: 2014-11-10 16:33:06
That is true, that would be a problem. What we really need is a PayPal but for Bitcoin....a lot of things changed. So a middle party that helps stop fraud between non business people. Almost like a holding account where the company can protect both sides. PayPal is good in that respect, but the fees are too high, and the length of time it takes to get money into your account is too long. 
@_date: 2015-05-05 12:19:36
The original 20BTC was returned. What was weird was that all the normal protocol for what would happen...happened. The game registered the bet, because the amount was taken from my wallet value, and put on the table. 
They are not even willing  to address this any further, so I am kind of stuck.
@_date: 2015-05-14 23:26:42
I wish the customer service representative I was talking to was a software engineer. 
@_date: 2015-05-02 16:03:30
I think I might have to change. So stressful.
@_date: 2015-05-14 23:20:42
I am a Computer Science graduate, fresh out of college, and it seems to me that this is very shady practice also. I don't understand why they wouldn't store every piece of data that they could, even to avoid situations like this. 
@_date: 2015-05-02 16:17:49
Yes, Cloudbet seems to have a lot of non-automated systems, including withdrawal. Its such a shame, I did really enjoy using their system, but this can't keep happening.
@_date: 2015-05-14 23:49:47
Oh no I know. I was just giving another example. 
@_date: 2015-05-15 14:49:16
Still a breach of privacy revealing some of the betting history either way. 
@_date: 2014-12-07 07:09:10
It should be instant. I should have access to my money whenever. It seems ridiculous that Bitcoin, created by one man, can outperform all banks...
@_date: 2015-05-15 04:01:53
But it is probable that I was able to put 20BTC worth of chips on the table. Which to me at the time meant that I had placed a 20BTC bet. 
@_date: 2015-05-15 08:16:35
I think you are missing the point. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 00:15:24
Very cool little page. I might have to set that as my homepage too.
@_date: 2015-05-16 03:32:45
It is dumb because someone decided to swear, make an accusation against me questioning my integrity and believe that 1Btc covers the 20BTC that should of been paid out. It is not my fault that there is a bug in the system, but I had no idea that it would incur a bug. 
I am trying to resolve a problem, and was asking for help from the community. Instead I have started to be attacked personally. That is why I believe it is dumb.

Satoshi bet is probably fair, but you never know with a GUI system. This situation had made me so skeptical of any and all online casinos. 
@_date: 2015-05-15 02:35:50
So I was cheated out of the rules? And that is ok? I am more concerned about the integrity of Bitcoin, the regulated companies that associated themselves with it and its future. 
Your point is irrelevant.

Haha the money really doesn't bother me at all. It is not that much.
@_date: 2015-05-14 17:01:43
I know. I have been fighting them for over a month now, I really want people to see the problem here. I was totally willing to help promote them if they resolved this the right way, but they did not.
@_date: 2015-05-15 14:51:28
This is just dumb.
@_date: 2015-05-02 15:43:41
Im not sick when I lose the money, thats the risk. I am sick about when I win, and I just don't get paid. That is bad!
@_date: 2015-05-05 16:49:26
I appreciate the link. I posted a complaint. From the comments Cloudbet has been making, it seems they aren't even interested in finding a solution. 
Furthermore, I tried placing bets at the start of a new shoe. There is an error there, sometimes you can place a bet, sometimes you can't. It seems the very first hand is ignored sometimes, and sometimes it isn't.
@_date: 2015-05-15 07:26:39
You divulged information about money lost. Not specifically, but you did say I had heavy losses. Privacy breach.
@_date: 2015-05-15 06:41:09
I don't really think that has any relevance. I am allowed to do with my money as I wish. I am going to neither confirm or deny how much I have won, lost, have saved up, or my checking account. I am furious that personal info is now being shared like that so publicly. What is not much for me, could be a hell of a lot for someone else, but that value should not be shared, unless I want it to be.
Edit: sounded like a mad reply, more frustrated at the way this is turning out.
@_date: 2015-05-02 15:43:58
True, but I was assured this issue could not happen again.
@_date: 2015-05-04 17:27:42
Ha, it was a risky bet. Glad it paid off. Hopefully they actually get back to me at some point. 
@_date: 2015-05-15 06:31:49
Good to see they are directly breaching their privacy policy by sharing information, which has been presented biasedly and incorrectly, to support their claim. Any money I lost, was lost a few days after this incident. The issue was raised immediately, before anymore gambling had taken place. 
@_date: 2015-05-14 16:59:24
Please see [this]( for the video.
@_date: 2015-05-02 16:45:59
That is a better explanation.
@_date: 2015-05-14 22:03:39
Well the issue is that they don't keep a backup of everyone's hands played...which honestly would not be that hard to do. So in essence the only backup they keep is of the table, not the bets that are played.
@_date: 2015-05-14 23:30:13
What was your major?
@_date: 2015-05-20 06:01:40
So tell me this. Why did it take so long for me to figure out the issue? There had to be the exact sequence of events to make it happen. Placing chips on the table is placing a bet, the game is suppose to copy that of any casino. I cannot usually place chips on the table when the game is no longer running, so why at this point am I able too? It is, most certainly, a bug. 
You are also right, this did happen before, but I did not know why, or how. I was dismissed by Cloudbet, so then tried to recreate the issue. I proved the situation, and was then dismissed again. At that point, I went public with the issue, as who am I suppose to turn to? It cost me 20BTC.
@_date: 2015-05-02 15:45:16
That is why I jumped on reddit. I have been a good customer of cloudbet, and the fact that this has happened again is just awful. 
@_date: 2015-05-14 19:03:54
I will contact any Casino licensing groups they are registered with, and take that route. I would not want to screw over the company that provided me the Bitcoins, this is not their fault. 
It is tough at this stage, as Cloudbet have accepted that there is an issue, and are endorsing the fact that they made a mistake. They are not however trying to resolve the relationship with me, or now the Bitcoin community. I am glad there is somewhere that this type of information can be shared.
@_date: 2015-05-15 06:06:07
Ha still not getting better really. AskGamblers still need to give a resolution to the current issue.
@_date: 2015-05-15 04:24:59
Well congratulations! 
@_date: 2015-05-06 15:02:16
That is not the issue. The issue is that the initial bet on the first shoe does not register. That is where the issues lies. 
@_date: 2015-05-02 15:49:15
I would love to get you a beer, but cloudbet have 20 of my missing BTC.
@_date: 2015-05-05 14:44:45
I will do that right now and post the link to the review.
@_date: 2015-05-05 03:49:05
The chips were placed on the table. Simple as, they were on the table when the game had locked in after the timer. I am not certain about when I placed the bet, but it was placed! There was 20,000 chips on the table at the time the game had been locked in. 
@_date: 2015-05-14 23:17:48
No, I really don't care about the payment. I would be happy to recreate the problem again. I was trying to recreate the issue, and I managed to place chips, so I immediately started the video. You can see that the "Bet" field says 3....so is that not enough?
@_date: 2015-05-16 03:35:51
I did lose money, I lost 20BTC. I was willing to put up that much money, so why is if right that because I didn't lose anything, it is all ok? I played the game, I won! I didn't get my reward. It is pretty clear cut black and white.
@_date: 2015-05-15 02:36:17
Thank you.
@_date: 2015-05-14 23:35:22
Great article. Another use case for Bitcoin, and how it can continue to combat illegal activities. Yes, that includes you @_date: 2015-05-15 03:20:50
Haha love this!
@_date: 2015-05-15 01:07:57
The hard fork stopped those coins ever being used.
@_date: 2015-05-15 01:31:48
I placed a bet, it said 20BTC was Bet, that's all I knew at the time. 
@_date: 2015-05-05 14:42:36
I don't have access to that. They are just saying that it was never placed. I am sure at this point they have stricken it from their records too.
@_date: 2015-05-02 15:45:33
Ok, I hope this is resolved quickly.
@_date: 2015-05-02 19:55:44
sorry. I can fix that.
@_date: 2015-05-15 03:48:47


Testing your system with minimal amounts of money, to prove that this situation could arise again. 


They did not have the video evidence to support this case, just work of mouth. So I had to reignite the testing, betting on different games to see where it could happen again. 


The bet is already placed, and according to your system, it takes the money, then returns X amount if you win. 


I did not make threats. I promised I would do something in order to assure I would get a response. I am the small fish here trying to protect myself. I was trying to also figure out a solution to both parties, but clearly that message was not received. 


You already divulged A LOT of betting history here, so your just breached some of your terms and conditions by doing this. 
**EDIT: Also, thank you for agreeing that there was an error in your system that would of stopped me from winning.** 
@_date: 2015-05-15 17:56:16
So you are saying, that if a dealer in a casino says in his head that no more bets can be placed, that is viable? If a bet can be placed on the table, it is the fault of the software engineer. This type of problem should be easily avoided! 
@_date: 2015-05-14 17:24:23
Appreciate that so much! I'll continue to keep updating, hopefully this is the last one!
@_date: 2015-05-15 08:41:56
Still revealing information about an individual.
@_date: 2015-05-15 14:52:44
They didn't pay out.
@_date: 2015-05-14 17:00:12
Please see [this]( for the video.
@_date: 2015-05-15 01:47:44
So Cloudbet could implement a function that says the following.
if player submits a large bet and they have been winning and they win this hand 
take the bet off, and do not pay out.
Would be very easily to implement. That is what you are saying is ok!
@_date: 2015-05-02 15:43:15
Nothing, it is disgraceful that this has happened. I don't understand why a Casino, which already has the odds in its favor, do this to boost their edge. 
@_date: 2015-05-14 17:21:08
I will. It's just a nightmare, but I think good for the community.
@_date: 2015-05-02 15:46:48
yea, it seems like there is some kind of system in place to protect them from large bets, or occasional winning to improve their house edge. 
@_date: 2015-05-14 16:59:45
Please see [this]( for the video.
@_date: 2015-05-14 23:31:04
The fact that this is even happening, is so exciting. The future is very very bright!
@_date: 2015-05-15 01:48:33
That is a better comparison. You are right.
@_date: 2015-05-14 23:29:06
He was making a reference to doing a chargeback from the initial place I purchased the coin from. 
@_date: 2015-05-03 00:16:45
It is a shame a company has to work that way. I expect them to fulfill their requirement.
@_date: 2015-05-15 14:52:16
I wagered 20BTC, the hand was won. I should of gone from 20BTC to 40BTC.
@_date: 2015-05-15 00:58:01
Well we will always need licensing and some form of body to protect individuals. Otherwise we will be headed down black market routes. Ha, but I see what you are saying, not the normal Bitcoin comments.
@_date: 2015-05-14 18:09:46
Haha right! Appreciate the sly comment, but we all have our own finances to deal with. 
@_date: 2015-05-03 00:31:21
Yea, it really is a shame that the blockchain technology you speak of isn't readily available or tested...
@_date: 2015-05-16 03:30:04
For what? That is a considerable amount of money to not have to pay out.
@_date: 2015-05-15 05:21:11
Essentially they did, as that changes the house edge drastically if bets are not processed correctly. In my example, they didn't process a huge win!
@_date: 2015-05-15 01:08:22
Are you working for Cloudbet? Attacking old posts of mine!
@_date: 2015-05-14 23:32:19
Awesome. I love that we are still seeing all of the issues banks are having with security, and Bitcoin is flawless security wise. 
@_date: 2015-05-14 17:26:02
This was before the video had become available. A new complaint was opened today, they will deal with this one, with this information, very differently. 
@_date: 2015-05-15 00:00:59
Hacked no, manipulated yes. Hacked implies getting unauthorized access. No one has ever hacked someone's wallet by using the public key.
@_date: 2015-05-15 00:58:47
Should all be built on the blockchain, so anyone can see it at any time!
@_date: 2015-05-15 02:44:16
...is the dumbest thing you could say. I'm not even sure what that means exactly. You don't think the Bitcoin community needs anyone and everyone to have its best interests in mind. From companies to users, it is important that we are all involved in the right way all the time!
@_date: 2015-05-15 04:16:53
I won the hand, didn't recover my winnings. 
@_date: 2015-01-02 06:09:12
I literally just click on the transaction, takes me to a new page with the information. Anywhere in that box where the transaction is listed, not necessarily the text. 
What happens when you click?
@_date: 2015-01-05 16:24:02
@_date: 2015-05-15 01:04:20
AskGamblers did not see the video. The issue here is that Cloudbet also agreed that there was a bug, is that not evidence enough. Omitting to the guilt.
What else would you like to see? I am not trying to hide anything, in fact I want to be as transparent as possible. I have noticed you are not in favor of any of my comments at all!
@_date: 2015-01-03 13:56:04
Really not sure. 
@_date: 2015-01-01 23:43:04
@_date: 2015-05-02 16:34:56
Because Cloud is suppose to be provably fair, and it was on the Live Table. So I could see the woman dealing the cards. It was a brand new shoe...which is why this is so crazy.

Higher risk only comes when dealing with dishonest merchants...I think you are missing the point of Bitcoin.

Yea, China is the main cause, but is that really a problem? Bitcoin was created to be global and accessible by everyone. It is good that such a large economy is buying into it as soon as the United States is. 
The more who adopt it, will make it more reasonable for more and more to adopt Bitcoin.
(Is this where I write "to the moon"?)
@_date: 2015-01-16 23:39:22
Hmm, this could be interesting.
@_date: 2015-01-02 05:22:29
What better way to do that than in a University. I am aiming to educate my peers, through use and teaching about how Bitcoin can be great for the future.
@_date: 2015-01-01 23:14:58
The price always seems to be the major point of concern. I feel Bitcoin is looked at as a stock, where value is the only real commodity. 
Transaction Volume is up, Bitcoin Bowl, Microsoft, Dell...all accepting Bitcoin in some form. 
The price is flat, the idea is flourishing more than ever before.
@_date: 2015-01-06 05:05:37
Sure! Just go ahead and tell me what my last Bitcoin transaction was. If you had bought drugs, from "Illegal Drugs Online" your account would be frozen. The Silk Road survived so long due to the privacy of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-05-14 18:37:09
Tell me what I have done wrong so I can rectify this.
I have contact Cloudbet privately, contacted independent agency, gone public, found proof of an error, showed them, then went public again.
I did what I thought was right. I was within my rights to request a bounty for a found problem, which could potentially have been exploited.
@_date: 2015-01-01 23:22:40
Damned government, probably hasn't been updated since you sold it...classic government software.
@_date: 2015-01-03 05:44:53
It as a specific percentage, up to 0.15% of the total turnover of each company I manage to signup to Bitcoin. I don't think that is a bad deal, as just spending a little bit of time to help the community, along with earning some money from it. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 17:41:16
You need to read up on everything you have written, or stop trolling. I enjoyed your poor uneducated response though!
1. Transfers are instant, verification takes a little bit of time. Only limited by the current code, can/will be changed to handle an infinite number of transactions per second. 
2. No one knows who owns what wallet address, and if they do...move the coins. 
3. You can just change the units...1000bits to a Bitcoin...this can continue with different units.
4. Blockchain is about 20GB, say it increased in size by 1000, that would cover the population, and would be a size of 20TB...I can store that in my pocket with a few hard drives. Data Centers store in the exabytes...so it is not even close.
5. There is more to the energy efficiency than that, Bitcoin is not just a transaction service. 
6. Again, coding can change that, to an UNLIMITED number per second. You can opt to have no verifications, which is why instant works for stores.
7. You are looking from a consumer point of view, money doesn't go into merchants accounts on weekends, or public holidays and takes a 3-4 days to actually go through. 
8. Bitcoin transactions fees, if you choose to use that option to speed up verification, are minisicule compared to the 2-3% Visa charges. I just checked, to send $100 via western union, would cost me $5...5% is too much.
9. That is the whole issue, there should be a way to transmit things for free. The internet did that well, the only thing we pay for is the use of the internet, which could be related to transaction fees.

 I am currently looking to start developing simple sites for bitcon related entrepreneurs to sell their product, would you be interested in talking more about it?
@_date: 2015-01-03 13:31:04
It's not a pyramid scheme. BitPay is about helping businesses get into Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-05-15 04:24:08
I hope it does. It's not even about the money for me! It is about the principle here. Fight for what is right.
@_date: 2015-01-02 06:01:34
If he looks at the transaction details, which you can do with any transaction on coinbase, you can see exactly what is going on. There will be somewhere that has a list, with checkboxes which explain what needs to be done to release the funds.
Can you submit a screenshot of the transaction information, make sure you blackout anything you need too!
Don't use vault unless you really need to hide away Bitcoin (hundreds of them)...use two factor authentication on coinbase. 
@_date: 2015-01-02 05:34:46
Easy fix. The wallet they are pulling the Bitcoin from is their own personal vault, a feature that coinbase brought into their system not too long ago. It requires validation (usually via email) to begin the withdrawal process. The vault acts as a security between two parties to ensure that the Bitcoin is not just pulled with no forwarding! Neat little system if you have others accessing your account.
Tell them to make sure the steps are completed for validation. The validation steps can be found by clicking the transaction, where it says "WAITING FOR APPROVAL." 
If you have more trouble, let me know. Or looking Vault on coinbase.
@_date: 2015-01-02 06:16:21
Well there clearly is some verification that is missing. I just did the same thing on my phone, and you can click on the transaction and it will tell you exactly what is going on, what is missing, etc. 
Did you get them to click on the verification...and if you do go to PayPal, enjoy having them take x% from your profit! 
Don't give up! Help teach!
@_date: 2015-05-19 16:15:12
What difference does it make when it started. The issue was that during the shuffle, I was able to place a bet. Cloudbet acknowledged that the bug existed...not really sure what your point is here.
@_date: 2015-01-26 08:58:32
I'm sorry to hear that. If you can, find a way!
@_date: 2015-01-02 05:19:59
And this is evidence in itself that the growth of Bitcoin is required. It poses so many more good things than it withholds. It gives opportunity to an industry that steals, lies and costs the average individual so much in tax dollars. One day banks will be gone, or they will be very different than how we view them today.
@_date: 2015-01-02 05:21:02
Oh I am all the way in. I just want to help people see its benefits as a currency!
@_date: 2015-01-02 05:23:04
I love that. We all need to help our local communities accept Bitcoin, this will take us so much further.
@_date: 2015-01-01 23:21:37
Great points. I don't see Bitcoins low price as an issue at all however. The price doesn't necessarily represent exactly what is going on with Bitcoin right now! 
@_date: 2015-01-01 23:28:10
Look specifically at the market capitol. Not the value of each coin.
@_date: 2015-01-03 17:32:23
Pyramid Scheme: a form of investment (illegal in the US and elsewhere) in which each paying participant recruits two further participants, with returns being given to early participants using money contributed by later ones.
Not a pyramid scheme. Getting rewarded for increasing business is probably just called employment.
@_date: 2015-01-01 23:18:16
I would love to buy them from you with Bitcoin! I have never done a trade like that, would be happy to share my real name and identity if that would help (via PM obviously).
@_date: 2015-01-02 05:29:56
I agree, Bitcoin is just one step towards the future. The main approach to change from convention. Anything based upon the idea of Bitcoin is always good, positively pushing towards the future!
@_date: 2015-01-02 16:32:26
Coinbase have a live chat option at the bottom of every page, use that. They will be able to tell the user what was going on.
Outside of that and actually looking at the account, there isn't anything I can help with...sorry. Their system has pretty clear instructions. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 10:12:31
The price had very little to do with my inclusion. It was all about the announcement of the second exchange for me. Very exciting indeed.

Email their customer support about becoming a partner. They will direct you in the necessary steps to do so!
Good luck!
@_date: 2015-01-02 05:28:11
This could be huge. Although we all hate parking fines, the proof of work will be in the success of using Bitcoin! It would be a prime business model for others to see the benefits of using Bitcoin to receive as payment. 
@_date: 2015-01-02 06:23:15
That makes sense! I didn't think it was a profitable move. The whole idea that people donate those kind of resources to the community, makes me feel proud to be apart of it. 
@_date: 2015-01-02 05:24:26
I am a dev in my own right. I am looking into ways I can help the Bitcoin community through coding the future. I just don't understand why negativity is the best form of response for some of these individuals.
@_date: 2015-01-04 17:42:56
You can hide the transactions by splitting into numerous wallets, sending the money to a variety of different places. There are ways to hide it. 
@_date: 2015-05-04 04:25:18
I know what you mean. I guess I can understand that if someone had a lot of success on the site, there could be issues with having enough funds to pay out, but realistically, this whole site could be totally managed without any administrators. 
Also...I still have not been awarded my money. 
@_date: 2015-05-14 19:29:50
Just 1BTC, didn't even consider giving me back the 20BTC. I don't care about the reward at all. I just wanted my original winnings back.
@_date: 2015-05-15 19:05:17
I am in the process of doing that. Everything works slowly.
@_date: 2015-01-26 08:55:30
I am a student too! Luckily on a full athletic scholarship at a nice D1 University. I have contacted family for months, spoken to them about the benefits, the long term return, and the future. You will be surprised who will invest in you when you spend the time to teach. 
I have also made good money working wherever I can, simply to save for this moment. Preparing for it. If it never came, then I just have a nice little nest egg to play with. But it has come!
@_date: 2015-05-14 21:43:56
I'm not sure about the ethics of that!
@_date: 2015-01-22 06:20:22
True, but the Winkle COIN ETF is coming is it not?
@_date: 2015-01-03 04:51:27
They will get back to you eventually! It was late in the day too!
@_date: 2015-01-01 03:08:04
Isn't the aim to bring Bitcoin to the masses, I am just trying to help the community accept the currency and display its benefits. 
@_date: 2015-01-01 03:01:19
That sucks. I was hoping to help merchants accept Bitcoin, then bring in a Bitcoin ATM once I have helped the merchants. I would be getting them setup with BitPay. BitPay have a partner program which I can be apart of to help merchants accept that. 
EDIT: Isn't the proof that Bitcoin could be successful.
@_date: 2015-01-22 05:24:11
I can't even imagine how this will change everything. Like what will happen...I feel like the source code will just explode with excitement. This will legitimize everything...
@_date: 2015-05-14 21:43:38
Really good question.
@_date: 2015-01-06 00:31:12
Everything digital, banks are extremely easy to trace transactions. Bitcoin just creates some level of obsecurity at the minimum. 
@_date: 2015-01-01 23:44:45
Agreed! I just wanted to get people thinking positively about helping people in this community!
@_date: 2015-05-14 17:17:03
It can be traced, they are licensed as a gambling site...I think that is good enough. This is just another step to building an honest, good community.
@_date: 2015-01-03 04:52:16
That's good! I am glad you have the patience to show them what it is. Too often do we come across people who don't want to or care to take the time.
@_date: 2015-01-28 18:21:17
Cash has no traceable values! If I buy 1000kg of Cocaine with cash, will anyone know I have done that? At least with Bitcoin, you would be able to see that a large transaction is made, even if you don't know who owns the wallet.
I am sick of all governments.
@_date: 2015-01-02 05:17:38
I am glad there are a lot more positive people in this community than negative. I just wish we could all convince 5 people and 1 merchant to accept Bitcoin. That could be a major turning point.
@_date: 2015-01-03 13:55:41
Any income the company you bring into to Bitcoin receives, you will take a share of.
@_date: 2015-01-01 03:04:02
I understand that. It seems that if no one ever takes this step, we will never get out of this stage of Bitcoin that we are in right now. If merchants accept Bitcoin, won't people start to use it? Im just looking to bring it to the people that can sell the individual items that we may need. I just want to help the community!
@_date: 2015-05-14 23:37:21
Well, Bitcoin companies have been hacked. What has not been hacked, is the wallets. The protocol of Bitcoin is what is secure. The infrastructure around Bitcoin could be insecure depending on who writes the code to support it. 
@_date: 2015-01-03 06:13:59
Haha why?
@_date: 2015-01-27 03:09:43
Who accepts any alt currency? 
@_date: 2015-01-01 23:16:08
Agreed! A bit of advice along the way is never bad. Does your software company accept Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2015-05-14 23:44:28


That is not the wallets being hacked. That is people not taking care of their private key. I guarantee if I gave you the public key, of a wallet containing 100,000BTC ($23.5Million), you could not get ANYONE to crack this. 


Which is why there is a certain number of confirmations required and why no mining pool should go over 51%. Anything is insecure when one individual totally controls it, but if we all verify and confirm a transaction, that is where security lies. This bug was also fixed near instantly. 
@_date: 2015-05-15 06:19:08
How do you know that? Where did I say that? I never said anything about what happened to that money. 
And what happened to that money beyond that point does not matter. If I had won 10 bets in a row after that, I would still be mad about not getting paid for this one.
@_date: 2015-01-02 06:33:06
Looking at basic supply and demand, we could see a rise in price, especially with the current rate of adoption! I look forward to the halving, as it could really change the game in terms of price. If price goes up, miners would still mine!
Who knows though right? 
@_date: 2015-01-03 04:50:59
That is just the type of ignorance we don't need. Bitcoin as a concept isn't hard to grasp, Bitcoin as the technology is hard for everyone. Wallets with crazy addresses, being able to access the wallet from anywhere, being able to divide the coins into so many decimal places. 
Are you telling me your grandmother, who may have grown up without a computer will be able to understand Bitcoin on a solid enough level to:
1. Ensure wallet security
2. Process a transaction easily
I just spoke to my girlfriend about it. She knows what it is, and that she can pay for stuff with it...anything beyond that is a mystery. 
I'm actually frustrated by that comment. Very one minded approach.
@_date: 2015-05-14 17:00:00
Please see [this]( for the video.

They almost need to arrive in unison, that would be the most beneficial. I am thinking of trying to setup a system in my University where I can utilize the campus store to be a starting point to accept Bitcoin. Meanwhile getting my friends involved in accepting Bitcoin. Having seminars to teach about Bitcoin too.

It would of been more of a kind gesture...but the money would be from being able to report a major issue...I don't even want that. I just want my winnings.
@_date: 2015-05-15 03:24:17
Another proof case.
@_date: 2015-05-14 19:06:11
That makes sense. I have been talking to them for over a month now, and they are refusing to help. If I find a problem which will give them a greater house edge, I feel like it is right for me to inform potential customers of this issue. I will not exploit it, but they chose, after I said I was going to have to go public, to not resolve this in the correct way.
@_date: 2015-05-02 23:48:26
lol, I should of been done the first time, but I was assured it wouldn't happen again.
@_date: 2015-05-15 14:48:38
Jesus, no. I place a bet for 20BTC. I won the hand, but I didn't get my winnings. 
@_date: 2015-05-15 01:00:04
So this action is fine? This is ok? For a system to allow an issue such as this. Is that what you are saying?
@_date: 2015-05-14 23:45:47
EXACTLY. I'm glad someone finally said it.
@_date: 2015-01-22 05:49:09
You think? Even with all of the talks about the Wink twins ETF?
@_date: 2015-05-15 08:41:42
I did. I placed the bet on the table. Did you read the post?
@_date: 2015-05-15 08:21:26
I have said this a few times, I will say it again. I found a bug. That is what I thought I should be paid for. But honestly, all I really care about is that this is resolved the right way!
@_date: 2015-01-04 17:42:07
Right...some of the responses here are so...bad. 
@_date: 2015-05-14 20:21:37
It's crazy how it all works. Even when you do win, they take your money.
@_date: 2017-03-27 02:48:16
This is my one issue with Bitcoin at the moment. The idea was that it was meant to be free (or extremely cheap) to transfer any amount of money. I enjoyed sending my girlfriend some Bitcoin while she was in Mexico to buy a drink (like $3-4).
With a $1 charge, that takes away the excitement of money which is easy, fast and cheap.
With the changes, although necessary, it gives me this odd feeling that it isn't going to be what I thought it would be, where value can be transferred freely, fast and cheap. 
Is there a need for a complete re-evaluation of the Bitcoin protocol, make some changes to resolve the problems we have experienced this first time? Easier said than done I guess.
@_date: 2015-05-15 06:39:38
Thank you for also breaching my privacy here by revealing information about my betting history, including wins and losses. Also, as you say I never placed the 20BTC bet, does this also mean I never placed the 3mBTC bet that was caught on video? Just because your system was inadequate and did not recreate the issue correctly, does not mean it was not placed. This is not the 60s, and this is not gang land in Las Vegas.
@_date: 2015-05-15 01:01:09
Ha yea, but in all honestly I don't care about the payment. But as for any work anyone does, everyone here would expect compensation.
@_date: 2015-05-15 01:06:54
I'm confused at what you are saying. I wouldn't be successful as they could prove that the Bitcoin was given to me. I don't want to force a chargeback at all. My company, Coinbase, has done nothing to deserve that. I want to resolve the issue with the company that caused the problem.
@_date: 2015-05-15 04:04:45
Great. Clearly there is an error in the code. As even a software engineer pointed out that even every click can be monitored in a system like this. 
@_date: 2015-05-20 15:10:38
An during the shuffle, because it was shuffling, you can always place your bet down at any casino. That's what I believed I was doing.
@_date: 2017-03-27 05:41:22
A $1 fee makes buying a coffee at a local store a financial impossibility, stopping at a gas station for snacks more expensive. I thought the idea of Bitcoin was to take away from the fees, the cost, all of that. 
With fees going up, do we just start talking about large money transfers, so once again finances head towards the 1%...which was one of the areas Bitcoin was suppose to help. 
@_date: 2015-05-15 07:06:41
No one said that I lost that remaining money on the site. I had lost some money prior to that, then made the 20BTC bet to recoup it, was feeling lucky after a string on losses, so I placed the new bet, which was won. That is all I am saying.
@_date: 2015-05-05 19:35:16
Cloudbet denied me ever making the bet. Gross action by them, I will continue to get ratification for this.

I didn't hate this article, as it still puts into context how small Bitcoin is as a whole. Believe me, I love Bitcoin and the concepts it brings to the table, I have just been struggling recently with really understanding the scale at which it would take to change the consensus around the world.
I also do worry about the number of transactions it can handle at once. What if Bitcoin isn't the answer to handling the number of transactions at a cheap price that we are used too. 
 If we are talking about Bitcoin being a rounding error, then we are clearly still quite a way off from being where we need to be in terms of a global currency. 
I am by no means against Bitcoin, huge fan infact, the only way we can improve something is by trying to find flaws in it.

I hope we can get back to the 2000-4000 range. I know the longs won’t want that, but I would like to pickup  few more before we head over $100k next time. Short term pain, long term gain. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 23:55:56
You realize you aren’t the first person to say that right? It has happened prior to every rise...just the numbers are different. 
If that is your logic, it would never have reached $20k.

Not at all what I said! I value Bitcoin at a much higher price, but unfortunately I do not have the funds to buy them if they were higher. Why the negativity.
@_date: 2015-08-22 15:04:17
My financial status is clearly not the point, and what is a lot to some, might not be a lot to someone else. Thanks for taking the point away from the situation.
@_date: 2015-08-22 16:12:09
How is it pointless? Cloudbet had an error that caused me to not win money I bet. I was just finalizing this. 
@_date: 2015-08-31 01:56:27
I agree, not worth the cost at all. Might as well just buy the Bitcoin. With a 9 month ROI, we will be staring the reward halving in the face, so who knows what will be going on with the price at that point.
@_date: 2015-08-31 01:35:02
I still think the Ƀ symbol is the best option. There is nothing quite like it. The ฿ and the two line alternative both seem to follow the $...is that not something we are all trying to get away from. I believe the Ƀ offers a perspective that is new and different. It looks modern and ready for the future. 
Maybe I am just seeing it differently to everyone else. 
@_date: 2015-08-31 14:01:56
That makes zero sense.
@_date: 2015-07-12 18:16:57

One of the 5 major ones (I don't know if there is a white hat benefit to me telling them).
@_date: 2015-08-20 01:09:42
Why with all the assumptions? It's as simple as if the price is lower, I can purchase more with the money I have available for an investment. 
@_date: 2015-07-12 22:08:55
That makes sense...I think I could get my bank password wrong 100 times, and it never lock me out.
@_date: 2015-07-12 17:25:19
Charles Schwab do something very similar in terms of password length. It's so rudimentary to ensure the passwords fields are case sensitive. Quite amazing.
@_date: 2015-07-12 17:26:07
Yea! I love Bitcoin for that. And no, 2FA I don't think my bank has ever heard of (it doesn't promote it at least).
@_date: 2015-07-12 23:30:59
I love charts like this. It really shows how minuscule Bitcoin is, even though it is almost becoming common knowledge. Such an exciting point in it's life cycle. It for sure is here to stay.
@_date: 2015-07-17 01:10:30
So how detrimental is this to Bitcoin. It seems like the error made was human accept a zero confirmation transaction. Will there ever be a way to make zero transactions confirmations totally secure?
@_date: 2015-07-12 23:04:24
I am moving, don't worry about that. I am not sure if I should raise awareness to it or not.

I am about to write up a large follow up post regarding Cloudbet and AskGamblers. Some very bad behavior.
@_date: 2019-09-20 11:03:19
Why wouldn’t they just incorporate bitcoin into their system. Banks don’t create money, they are a utilization tool, they could do so well with it too.
@_date: 2015-04-17 03:11:16
YES. I don't see why people don't see it as that. Along with the benefits and security of the system as a whole. 
@_date: 2019-09-24 07:01:11
But you haven’t provided any “logical” reasoning to your statement. Murphy’s law? 
And you must be 12 to try and argue that point of being “emotionally invested”.
@_date: 2015-04-17 02:39:24
I look forward to that. I have loved getting friends to use Bitcoin, as I can then pay them back if I don't have cash, they need to borrow money, or something like that. If stores around me used it, I would be using it all the time.
@_date: 2015-04-17 13:03:41

@_date: 2015-04-17 04:17:45
Nah that's dumb. The infrastructure is not in place yet for it to be user friendly for the general population. But look at what is going on this year! Major investment into the implementation space. Once that is setup, maybe we will see a major rise after that.

Very true, but I didn't compare this to a company at all. I compared it to Gold. I asked what the value of gold was, and I didn't get an answer. 
People loved gold because it was something wealthy people had. It is totally speculative, it has no real value at all because it cannot do anything. Can you 100lbs of gold to the other side of the world securely and instantly? Bitcoin is speculative, but it does qualities that make it valuable. 
@_date: 2015-04-17 05:06:48
I didn't downvote like you asked! I was just saying why.
@_date: 2015-04-17 04:45:30
Because your comment didn't represent the truth about Bitcoin. It was incorrect regarding security, incorrect regarding what it does...just incorrect.
If the solution you are referring to is Apple Pay, that doesn't solve the underlying problem that Bitcoin solves. Fees and instant access. Name one bank in he world that offers that without putting up some risk themselves. 
@_date: 2015-04-23 12:58:41
Ok naturally I was raising an issue about a problem that I see with the currency. I use it on a daily basis through one means or another, so the negative attitude was pretty unnecessary. 
I also said I was invested...so there is some emotional involvement there too.
@_date: 2019-09-24 06:48:56
I don’t think you have any history on bubbles...the housing bubble makes this look like an ants shit.
Edit: it cost only Americans 12.8 trillion. So 1.3% the size of the total loss...not even the total market size.

I guess the internet is worthless, as is Facebook, as is twitter. Somebody should let those guy know.
@_date: 2015-04-17 13:03:04
That is true! I guess from $1 = 1900BTC to $240 = 1BTC...price has exploded. I am looking forward to see what happens when real big money gets involved. 
@_date: 2015-04-17 13:11:18
With size and trust, the price will get to a point where the fluctuations will be negligible. 
@_date: 2015-04-28 02:14:47
What website is this? Or how do you get access to this?
@_date: 2015-04-17 03:46:27
Very true...it's strange how, with those examples you just gave, gold was used as the original backing behind the U.S. Dollar. Those features have nothing to do with a currency or value, but more as an element. Bitcoin has the functionality of what a currency should be.
@_date: 2019-09-24 07:17:28
Ah the old “the internet says it in one place, so it must be true” logic. 
You got it ��
@_date: 2015-04-17 13:09:42
5 years if there was no internet infrastructure. Software developers are working really hard to create user friendly applications which can help individuals use Bitcoin. This is what is exciting.
@_date: 2015-04-17 13:13:06
Not just that, riches would be great. But there is basically no money in Bitcoin at all, so there is a lot to suggest that the price cap is not even close yet.
@_date: 2015-04-23 02:45:45
I was worried until you said...


where are you from?
I am not trying to troll. I just want this to succeed so badly for so many reasons!
@_date: 2015-09-29 02:57:40
Joke...I really hope Bitcoin changes this. Frees the world of financial corruption. 
@_date: 2015-04-17 02:47:42
Haha that is exactly what I was thinking. Buying food bitcoin with bitcoin to go poop out poo bitcoin
@_date: 2015-09-02 00:11:42
Does this mean that the accounts will show a Bitcoin value, separate from the $ or £ value of the account, or will it be a direct conversion into fiat? 
I understand that the idea of Bitcoin is to remove banks from the equation, but does this not gratify everything all of us have wanted. *Legitimacy and acceptance from the 1%*. I personally see this as extremely exciting, it could begin the slow influx of businesses also accepting the idea that Bitcoin would be beneficial for them too. 
If the idea of Bitcoin is to decentralize, I have never understood the centralized idea to remove banks. If banks are what the majority want and trust for now, let them have it. I still use banks, they offere security (if limited), but they currently fill the link between my funds online and me needing to pay a merchant. 
I see this as nothing but a promising future for this, even if they decide to cash out right away, they will see their potential gains from holding, or from a customer number perspective. 
 Excited
@_date: 2015-04-17 13:08:17
People love gold because it has always been loved, not really for any other reason. They don't buy it to line water pipes to stop erosion, they use it for jewelry. The intrinsic value of Bitcoin should come from the way it can be used. 
@_date: 2015-04-17 13:14:52
I love that, I am enjoying the world as it is. Hopefully I am graduating with my Computer Science degree at just the right time. 
@_date: 2015-04-17 02:36:03
But what gives value? Why is gold valuable? If we found gold on the moon, would the value of gold drop because we might try to mine it and send it back to earth? 
Speculation runs everything, the value seems to come from the perceived worth people put on an item. 
@_date: 2015-09-19 03:42:18
True, I was more thinking about the ability of the system rather than the user base. It is the killer app we are looking for to help Bitcoin. What do you think about that?
@_date: 2015-04-24 15:52:38
I will be leaving cloudbet. This situation should not arise, especially with a live casino. 
@_date: 2015-09-02 01:23:14
Maybe they are secretly hodling the bitcoin for themselves in a huge business gamble.
@_date: 2015-09-03 14:10:28
Would you care to elaborate moderator? Or just snide your way through this forum?
@_date: 2015-09-16 03:40:31
thank you. 
@_date: 2019-09-05 00:19:27
It will be interesting to see if this holds true if/when the general population starts using this more frequently. I can imagine this being blown out of the water if there is a move to this in a more real world sense (wages, property sales, international trade).
@_date: 2015-09-19 06:13:09
The fees are the one thing that really screams issues for eBay and PayPal.
@_date: 2015-09-02 00:16:13
Not necessarily. The options to buy/sell Bitcoin, for those who can, is already available as is. This could essentially give every business with a Barclays account a reason to accept Bitcoin, which could increase the number of Bitcoin's sold yes, but also people will actually be using their Bitcoin, instead of holding them. Opportunity because of availability. 
@_date: 2015-04-17 03:40:27
That is true! It is 7 though. A little software update can fix that.
@_date: 2015-09-19 03:07:00
Open Beta? Ok that would be good. 
@_date: 2019-09-24 06:56:17
Yea I disagree completely. The underlying asset is limited. It’s only currently at a market cap of ~$200billion, which is tiny in comparison to everything. To say it couldn’t have another dramatic increase when honestly no real money has been put into it yet is crazy.
@_date: 2015-04-17 13:10:47
That is true! So hopefully the Bitcoin Core Devs can figure out the block size issue soon, and get it scaling frequently enough that it will be useable. 
@_date: 2015-04-17 13:18:03
I know, which is why it is so important that these implementations are being looked at right now. Bitcoin is tiny on a global scale. Hell, its small on an averaged size city scale. So hopefully a solution can be found before the growth is found.
@_date: 2015-09-29 00:48:39
I think the clear issue here is that the old system is so greatly unregulated. Regulation came later when money laundering, drug trafficking and other illegal activities became a problem. 
I truly believe that money is money, like in the courts "innocent until proven guilty" should be matched with "clean until proven dirty". I feel this is unfair persecution because of something the lender is fearful of, without any just cause. 
@_date: 2015-04-28 02:19:04
If you look at pure numbers, then yes it is the same difference. However one shows a 50% decrease, whereas the other shows just a 0.05% change...that is when Bitcoin will be stable, I hope one day we live in a world where that is true!
@_date: 2015-09-19 03:24:47
Thats what I was confused about. Which is it?
@_date: 2015-04-17 03:41:07
Why are you explaining it as a company when you should be explaining it almost as a new element. Something that can be traded for an item.
@_date: 2015-04-17 13:06:08
Yes, which is why the investment into the Bitcoin space is so exciting. So much money being poured in to make it successful.
@_date: 2015-09-02 00:16:57
It for sure is a step in the right direction. Most legitimate thing I have seen with Bitcoin so far.
@_date: 2015-09-04 00:09:56
What do you mean by that? Am I wrong in my thinking. The major concern seems directly related to the scalability of everything, and going on the rate at which we are still expanding our technology frontier, it doesn't seem to be that much of a problem at all.
@_date: 2015-09-19 03:31:28
Why not?
@_date: 2015-04-24 02:21:42
I think I might. Very frustrating scenario.
@_date: 2015-09-03 02:35:47
Is it just me, or does this seem to make a lot more sense? How many transactions per second does this allow?
Edit: what is the formula to figure that out in terms of block size?
@_date: 2015-04-17 03:39:54
Haha what stuff? Melt? Make pretty jewelry.
@_date: 2015-04-17 02:33:30
What about the fact that Bitcoin is only 6 years old, its limited fees, it is traceable. There are no other creations like Bitcoin. The other options (such as Apple Pay) are just pretty a pretty dress on an ugly dog. It is something totally new and different, and could actually solve a lot of the fraud companies have to deal with in the current market. 
I think your view is just looking at facts now, not any possibility for the future, which confuses me as the future is what is important. The technology is unrivaled right now. 
@_date: 2015-11-04 23:19:26
You are crazy. There is no way this happens. The price will fall as miners try to take their biggest profits in months.
@_date: 2015-11-04 01:25:36
That's what I think. 
@_date: 2015-03-31 07:19:20
Amen to this.
@_date: 2015-09-18 01:01:59
It is so clear that they don't really know what to label it as. It really is all of those things. It can be used in any way deemed fit with the use of the blockchain, so they are trying to cover all of their basis. It is nothing they have ever seen or used before, so they are frightened about what it could do!
Go Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-11-03 04:22:50
They haven't resolved any of my problems, has been a disaster. Lost 20BTC to them, for nothing.
@_date: 2015-11-03 05:12:23
Hmm...before or after?
@_date: 2016-05-29 01:26:01
Haha we will see won't we. 
@_date: 2016-05-30 23:58:07
Maybe not that soon...but with the right bubble....I don't see why not. If it had AAPL market cap, 35k per coin. Just think about that. Apple isn't huge in terms of the entire world and the need for payment. It is interesting.
@_date: 2015-11-04 01:26:04
I hate that Bitcoin is still at a level where it can be manipulated that easily.
@_date: 2015-11-05 00:36:44
It has happened every other time before the auction. 
@_date: 2015-03-31 00:50:07
But the investment is in infrastructure, not the coin. It seems to be building access. I see it as the "teach a man to fish" analogy. 
@_date: 2015-10-07 04:57:38
I'm only playing risky stocks on the stock market to try and generate some more $$ to buy more BTC. I am hoping the price holds until January-February for me, so I can try and catch the wave with a bigger board!
@_date: 2015-02-05 06:21:17
The reason for the Bitcoin ATM was to help people see what is going on. It is instant, totally instant, whereas with circle you have to setup an account, attach a bank account and then submit the funds. If these business can setup a discount for using Bitcoin, college kids would flourish to it. It's about accessibility at this point I believe. 
I too also prefer circle and coinbase, I have quite a stockpile of BTC myself, but often people just don't have the time. I want to create impulse, to then create a need.
@_date: 2015-02-05 06:24:17
Hmm, I like that. What exactly do you advertise to get non believers to come?
@_date: 2015-03-27 16:39:49
Holy hell...someone with a helpful response. 😁
@_date: 2015-02-05 06:24:46
So what you are saying...is that it really is time for Bitcoin to become mainstream. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 06:25:34
Hmm, I have a tough time with all of my professors. Even as Computer Science teachers, I often find it quite tough to discuss the ins and outs of such an idea, as it is so alien to them.
@_date: 2015-02-21 07:46:03
I think still sitting, waiting in my Sony cart for the fateful day that either my history gets deleted, removing the cookies, saying goodbye to the cart forever, or hopefully, for Bitcoin to be accepted by Sony!!!
@_date: 2015-10-13 03:27:32
That is the singular biggest problem I see with Bitcoin as a "currency" right now. However, with size will come stability, a daily change of $1,000 per BTC won't be noticeable hardly at all if each coin is worth $100,000. We can only dream of such days right now though.
@_date: 2015-02-04 17:46:18
The creation of the iPhone was not a totally new technology. Bitcoin is comparable to the creation of the telephone. It's is a completely new idea, how long before every home had a phone, then a mobile phone, then a smartphone...that is the comparison. 
@_date: 2015-03-03 19:01:29
I did not. 
@_date: 2015-02-23 06:23:08
I honestly take the view that this report shows only good things about Bitcoin when taken into context. We currently sit at something like 2million users (over estimate I believe) in which case that is less than 1% of the national population of the United States. He stated that Bitcoin accounted for 2% of gross revenue, which is probably double what it should be. 
On top of this, there is a reduced cost for the merchant, which we all know about. 
I still think there is nothing about Bitcoin that suggests anything but an upward trend from here on out. The market is growing, and people are seeing the benefits of it. One more collapse of the banks, possibly the euro, and we could all be looking at a rise of popularity like we have seen so many times before.
Great report, says so much more than what you have written there!

Question: do turds come with account signup, or do we need to create a fake account first? 💩
@_date: 2015-02-05 06:23:18
Yes! I have been looking into that, so working on that as we speak.
@_date: 2015-02-21 07:48:24
I think that their trading scheme involves stocks that are constantly losing value, due to the increasing number of turds in the system. However, I think their turds do come with toilet paper, some even have fresh corn!
@_date: 2015-02-05 14:07:40
Why do you say that? I have read numerous reports that many of the Bitcoin ATM's have made quite a bit of money after the initial expenses.

Yeah, you just agreed with him...which is good but I think you were trying to show that as a negative. Bitcoin global knowledge has grown exponentially, just like you said.

I am actually a Computer Science graduate, studying my masters, so I would love to look at it.
