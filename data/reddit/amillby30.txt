Cool thanks for this info I’ll give it a go and see if my net is up for the challenge.

What do you mean by scaling?

Is there a clear winner to fill that purpose or is it still up in arms at the moment? What makes ETH or LTC more suitable than bitcoin?

That’s the one I see everyone taking about, but what happens if the hardware fails? Are you able to retrieve your bitcoins off of it? Is that what the words are that you have to write down on paper?

Awesome thank you.

Thank you so much for all this information! I actually bought one of those ledger hardware wallets today so I will make sure to test it with a small transfer and wipe it before I move all my funds over. I’m pretty much done buying at the moment, thinking about doing $50 a week for a while but not sure yet. Thanks again for your comment!

So the lightning network aimed at drastically reducing transaction times and costs?

Ahh ok I understand, awesome thanks for your help!

It looks like it’s only a matter of time before bitcoin becomes a daily norm for ordinary people, but say if there are a billion+ people all on board and using it would that be the point where you can go get a cup of coffee using your bitcoin? Or are there other issues we have to face before then?

Thanks for the info, I will defiantly be moving my funds off of coinjar now that I understand how the wallets work and I’ll check out IndependentReserve also!

Thanks for your advice, your the second person who has said tri use Independent Reserve, I’m going to check them out and make an account. Cheers!

That looks interesting but I don’t think my internet connection could handle it. Can you run this on your main computer in the background or would it jam it up to much to do Day to day stuff on top?

Ok great, thanks so much for this information, I’m defiantly going to get one of those hardware wallets. That was the main thing I was worried about when I read on here about that GOX place that lost everyone’s bitcoins. Cheers man!
