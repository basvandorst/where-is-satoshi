Articulation goes a very little distance when you have less brain cells then fingers on my hand. Which is how many these kids making these posts surely have.

I can tell you I 100% didn’t sell at a loss. I bought in at 5k with quite a bit in previous holdings and sold 85% of my port at the peak. I have absolutely no reason to be spiteful. I don’t like kids with no real statistical backing trying to convey “trends” to influence others to buy or sell out of their own personal interest.

Also couldn’t help but notice you being into UFC, is your trailer a double wide?

I like the positive reply in regards to my very negative post. Not easy. Once again, not saying investing in bitcoin is a bad idea, but all these KIDS telling others when to hold and sell and acting as if they can see trends that aren’t even there just to appear knowledgeable is what makes me angry. I made my money on bitcoin and when I feel the time is right I’ll go back in but for now this is so toxic.

I care for the uneducated users who actually believe anything any little kid has to say on here and potentially take a loss because of it.

You’re PISSED �� 
@_date: 2018-05-24 04:39:16
I agree ��

Sound a little salty? Probably a shit poster yourself. Relax little man, you’ll turn a profit one day I promise, just HODL.

Like I previously replied to someone else, I am NOT anti bitcoin. I make a LOT of money off of bitcoin. I am anti kids on the internet presenting trends that hold no statistical backing and encouraging others when to buy and sell clearly out of their own interest. It’s toxic as hell.

Mad? Actually graduated, got a job as a supply chain analyst with a 500 company. Base salary over 105k and got my ADD diagnosed. Fucking clown haha. Hodl BABY!
@_date: 2018-05-24 04:12:07
I would love to. It’s truly a shame though that this sub is constantly flooded with fake trends and kids claiming to know what’s going to happen. Now don’t get me wrong, only a fucking moron would believe any of these people saying hodl, sell, peak here low there etc. BUT, you would be surprised how many people don’t go any further then a few posts here before making a choice and it’s awful to watch.
