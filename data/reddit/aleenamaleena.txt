Dear BitsenBytes, some people on reddit, have no idea what they are writing or understand fully my  project, so they just like to write some "smart idea" and step away just for good karma or upvote, this is the problem I think that people don`t understand the real value of satoshi or bitcoin and try to create a false picture on Bitcoin. So for those who think that these pictures were stolen, again they were taken from famous bitcoin community and freely available, and me as a huge bitcoin fan will freely use those pictures as much as I want while they are posted on community, since what goes to community stays for community, and stop commenting that I make some profit from this or anything like this, this is ridiculous, just go and calculate and try to convert it to your local currency, of coarse if you know how to do this.....Also for those who are concerned about copyright material, if you guys are so much concerned, you are more then welcome to take pics of your artwork and p.m. me the link of your sacrosanct images and I will try to put BTC on them and post on my twitter, but make sure to send me the fully image without any BTC sign on it, thanks for attention.

No, I dont use copyrighted works from other sites, all pics were taken from one famous Bitcoin resource, so this is a testing project and not chase any profits...&gt;_&gt;
@_date: 2015-06-11 18:00:20
no, I cant agree with you, it is just for testing purposes so stop telling me this stuff, I know what I am doing.
