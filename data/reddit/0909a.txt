Asking for someones degree type is like asking someone are you a democrat or republican. They are meaningless labels that have nothing to do with ones accumulation of knowledge and relevant information to the subject. Institutions such as college give you a very narrow minded approach to a lot of subjects (besides math engineering etc..). When people stop referring to actual content on the subject and referring to their piece of paper that got handed to them by an institution, you know you lost the argument. You got ripped off by whatever school you went to. You cant even hold a conversation.

If coins are permanently lost, the value of all other coins will go up spread across all coins equally so if 1000 btc was lost 21 million coins would get .01%(based on current price) increase in value overtime when the majority of consenus agrees that indeed the 1000btc was in fact lost.

I dont really plan on retiring but I am moving from Fiat to bitcoin  and investing in start ups I think that are promising, I really dont see a point in staying in fiat when its an inevitable fact that the dollar will collapse. the Cryto world is the wild west but this is the right place to be whether you lose all your money or not.

I hate this stupid nonsense. Every altcoin does this when the price falls. "OH CHEAP COINS NOM NOM NOM" "So glad the price fell so I can buy more" 
its all bullshit you know you would rather have it 5k per coin but you want to trick yourself into thinking low price = good.

Thats like flashing stock market news at them "you could of made this much in stock" thats how they think of it. what will really melt their brains is when you are more efficient than them with money. Exaple: you buy a cup of coffe in 2 seconds with your phone while they are pulling out their wallets for credit cards or cash

Im sure businesses will still report their earning when they convert BTC to fiat. I dont see how this effects anyone else. Its like when I have a garage sale I dont report that to the IRS, now why would I report anything done in bitcoin? for all they know I make less than 10k a year and dont need to file. 
tl/dr irrelevant
