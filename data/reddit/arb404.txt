I don't think the ruined economy of Venezuela is what's driving away foreign investment but the risk that anything you invest in might at any point be appropriated by the state. I don't think they're gonna get anywhere until they clean house of the current regime.

Okay you don't like a word I used. Do you have anything useful to add to the conversation?

Most definitely agree with you there. But can't agree that Bitcoin will be the only digital currency to come out of the crypto space.

It's funny how strong the idea seemed five years ago before cryptos like ETC got 51% attacked. It will be interesting to see how the next five go and which cryptos will still be standing.

The internet isn't just TCP/IP and HTML though so your metaphor doesn't really hold water. Maximalism is pretty dumb, BTC will likely stay dominant but I think you'll see niches filled better by other cryptos.

You also have UDP though. There's a lot by it's very nature that TCP/IP can't do, sure it's great for resilience but on it's own it isn't very useful at all, it's just a transfer protocol.

Always float the prenup idea as soon as she brings up marriage. No prenup no marriage.

Anyone else get bored of random speculators making outlandish predictions?
