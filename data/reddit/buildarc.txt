The toppings contain Potassium Benzoate...

I had to read all his books for a community college economics class.
All 3 books could have been summed up in about 20 pages. Not bad information, but the guy made his money selling books, so that makes sense I guess.
That being said... any news with Bitcoin is good news. Get the name out there. Make people think about it, curious about it, want to try it. It's the only advertising we got.

Because you're taking part in an enormous experiment, with an unpredictable direction, relying on the grim  hypothesis that all currency historically self-destructs given a long enough timeline. You're a member of a small group of people who have learned about a world changing technology and are slowly watching it evolve and take over corrupt institutions. Every time you check the price, what you should be thinking is, "How many more people have become believers today?"

Facebook banned all Bitcoin ads. We know why (scams) but that doesn't help with public opinion of Bitcoin, does it? Our current political climate is also a prime example of the "flagging system." How much of Project Prism did you read from the Snowden leaks? Did you actually read what Jullian Assange said about the DNC e-mails? How widely reported are the bank scams? Does anyone do much research for anything other than their own self interested? The right AND the left are self-serving. The banks, the social media, the government, etc. are all trying to shout each other down. Some are more than a voice, some are a mob.
If you think the modern media (any major news outlet, right or left) cares about the news... read about how funding was changed during the 80's and why the news shifted so radically from information to sensation.
The news loves or hates Bitcoin, only so much as the headlines make them money. They're eager for conflict, of any kind. A race war, a ground war, a gender war. A war on drugs, a war on poverty, a **war on currency**?
When you ask who... there's no answer. Who decides the price of oranges in winter? There is no single person. But there is a system, and you can buy shares in that system, and play the game.
