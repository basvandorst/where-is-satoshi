Most Of the VPNs on the list will admit to statistical analysis to watch for abuse including some of my favorites. Don't think that's possible with the log daemon turned off. Some (like LiquidVPN) have reported major attacks against banks using their servers. They warned the entire community that if they didn't stop he would have to turn on logging to identify and disconnect the user, but their datacenter disconnected them first. Companies like PIA say that they have proprietary ways of fighting abuse...

The faster it is the less secure it is. You probably shouldn't need to wait around for a confirmation on small purchases, but the more risk you take the longer you should wait. Also, there are services being created that allow instant transactions within their own private network as well as ways to verify you have the money so that a transaction from you can be instantly trusted.

I'm not exactly sure why VPNs point all log files to /dev/null though I doubt it's anything nefarious. It might have something to do with how the OpenVPN software operates and maybe their hesitance to re-write it. It would definitely be something to contact them and ask about specifically.

Trying to keep it simple, and relating /dev/null to a directory is simpler than talking about buffers/nodes. The thing is about computers, is that if one computer talks to another computer then information is automatically written to the device to document the action. If there is no information written then there is no proof that the device connected and therefore no way to connect them to the service. The only way to "disable logging" is for the information to be sent somewhere where it doesn't touch the hard drive. That's also why many servers are hosted entirely in ram disk to make recovering information extremely difficult. /dev/null has to report back to the operating system that the write operation succeeded to allow the user to connect to the VPN. 
Edit: after some more research, /dev/null is the same thing as disabling logging. No files are written anywhere. So in essence the computer is not aware of the IP address used to connect. Sorry if it seems like I'm not being perfectly clear, a lot of this stuff is pretty complicated to me and I'm definitely not an expert in either how the linux file system works or the exact process that VPNs go through to verify connections.

@_date: 2014-10-31 04:08:11
[Keepalive]( They check to see using their own internally assigned IP address how many sessions are connected. They either propagate this through a small amount of servers or through a central server. The data center you are actively connected to is able to witness your IP address but that information is sent to /dev/null so that it is instantly overwritten. The idea is that because many of the same users are connected through the same outgoing IP address, it makes it difficult for anyone who has access to the server to know which user is is sending the data. This is not a perfect scenario, as advanced timing attacks can statistically link the data together. Which is why for anything extremely sensitive you should be using Tor or a combination of the two.

@_date: 2014-10-31 04:32:46
This is the truth. Only use a VPN to hide your data from the ISP and hopefully government dragnet surveillance. It's entirely probable that there are honeypots out there, so for sensitive information you need to be using Tor. Everything has its risks, and using Bitcoins as payment does not make you anonymous to the VPN. If you don't want it to be possible for them to link your IP address to you, then pay with Bitcoins and only connect to the VPN through public wifi or another VPN as a second line of defense.
@_date: 2014-09-01 09:04:20
Then you have governments around the world requiring for relays to enact these blacklists. The only reason why governments don't demand this now is because it's not implemented into the code. Thanks, now tor is completely censored.

While researching the list I saw a few that would allow companies like the EFF or known members of security communities to view the servers live, as well as screenshots of configurations. The thing is, none of that matters if they can just switch it on whenever law enforcement shows up. It really sucks that there is not a way to do this trust-less besides using something like Tor.

[/dev/null]( is a specific location on linux servers that when data is written to, is automatically overwritten. The VPN providers point any system output that would normally be written to disk to this directory.

Bitcoin-QT was initially released as open source, doesn't really matter if the framework was closed source at the time. What matters is that all code that he wrote was available under the GPL. Also, Bitcoin-QT wasn't written by Satoshi, so it's a little bit off-topic.
@_date: 2015-01-30 11:52:15
Google did not create a business based upon open source. I don't think my post implied that closed source is inherently wrong, no matter what my personal views are on the matter. The issue at hand is a company building a userbase based upon this ideal and then backpedaling when their source code is used in the exact way that the license is made for.
@_date: 2015-01-30 13:48:20
Returning back to their open source roots and continuing to innovate. This is a knee-jerk reaction from a company that is not confident. They fail to realize that the people buying Chinese knock offs are not the same demographic as people that value quality builds, security, code,  ideas, and innovation. Savvy Bitcoin users are already on the forefront of keeping current with technology, and I doubt many of them are going to be willing to settle with a "copy and paste" design that will undoubtedly be slower in fixing possible security issues. They also need to look at their price again and maybe consider that they might have sold 3-4 times as many units if they had only halved the price. There's a reason why there is any interest whatsoever in a knock off Trezor, and I bet it's because of the massive price disparity, not because people view this Chinese company one day succeeding in creating a superior product.
@_date: 2014-09-06 20:50:36
You must have a very loose definition of spam.
@_date: 2015-01-30 11:39:29
The point is that a lot of hard work has been put into the Bitcoin protocol as well. Trezor made a reputation based upon being open and giving back to the community. This newest change of theirs is a step in the opposite direction. When a company decides to commit to open source, they should understand that this means that other people will use their work for whatever purpose they want. 
What do you think happened to Bitcoin when it was released? Alt-coins popped up by the hundreds. How did Bitcoin stay relevant? By releasing quality code and then continuously improving upon it. When Trezor decided to change their licensing, they are effectively saying that they are not a company that has what it takes to lead this area of innovation in a way that sets them apart. 
This is the spirit of open source, it makes people strive to improve on things and not remain stagnant. When you don't understand these concepts and release your code as a "me too" gesture, people see it as a way for them to protect their assets without having any kind of pressure to continue being leaders in the field. Greed.
@_date: 2015-01-30 13:50:32
Ah gotchya. I don't even know if it's possible to go in reverse from open source. It seems like that process would need completely separate code as the original code is not their possession anymore and is that of the community.
@_date: 2015-01-30 12:24:09
I don't think you or Trezor understand what open source means. The entire principle behind the concept is to allow other people to examine and USE the code in their own projects as long as they release any changes back into the open source community. If their only goal was to say "look at our code, we are not hiding anything" then they shouldn't have released their code using the license that they did. They fucked up, they didn't understand a contract they made with the community while building their business based upon users that support open source. They then tried to retroactively re-license their code in a sneaky fashion. This proves they had no idea what the license or the idea of a contract even means. Their current code up to this point is restricted within the open source community by their own doing, and there is nothing they can do to stop it. The fact that that they are trying to relicense the already licensed code is not going to work for them. 
@_date: 2015-01-30 11:44:43

@_date: 2015-01-30 12:07:06
Let me reiterate. Google did not build their company and userbase by claiming they were going to support the open source community and release their code to the masses. All you are referencing is their infrastructure. Only many years after the company's inception did they start releasing the likes of Chromium and Android
Trezor is essentially moving backwards from their initial promises to the community while a company like Google began to see the benefit in open source and started to release software in areas where they were willing to compete based upon the merits of their code. You have two companies moving in opposite directions, they are not relevant to each other.
@_date: 2015-01-30 13:54:40
They don't have to make changes at all or improve upon it. This clause is not within the GPL. I'm not advocating for this Chinese company whatsoever.
@_date: 2015-01-31 05:48:31
Even though they changed it back to open source, restricted source has an impact on security because you have a lot more people interested in your code and more opportunities for people to find problems.

I checked, and you are correct. It's just rare in the open source community since many projects have several outside developers. As long as they have permission from all contributors to the code, they can revert it back. What happens to someone who forked the original code before they tried to stealth change it? That person is now no longer legally able to use that code they were working on in their own project?
Edit: I asked r/opensource since they were discussing it. Read here:

You have no idea what the future of Bitcoin will be like. You are making arguments based on the assumption that people will all of the sudden stop caring about liquidity. We don't even have proper "audits" at this point. I fully expect companies to come around that run professional audits on these companies, and if coinbase refuses to do those, then you have the right to call them the "enemy"

If you are looking for a perfect solution, I don't have an answer. Using TOR through a VPN will definitely help. If you pay using Bitcoins and then only connect to the VPN through the TOR network (so they never see your real IP address) you are doing pretty good. You can also link multiple VPNs together so that only one knows your real IP address but is not aware of the sites you are accessing, and the other knows what site you are accessing but not your real IP address. So that hopefully one of the services you are using are actually telling the truth about no logging. You have to decide what part of your internet browsing you would like to keep most secure and use those methods. Things like torrenting probably only need a single VPN. Anything that would draw the attention of any state sponsored organization would probably need more.

United States NDAs courtesy of the patriot act make them a little difficult to recommend. Great for torrenting though.

All great VPNs

You are correct, check out the text directly below the list "Note: Using a VPN provider will not make you anonymous. But it will give you a better privacy. A VPN is not a tool for illegal activities. Don't rely on a "no log" policy."

One closed source software better than none.

In their forums, or if you click connect on the front page it goes to a direct link to the most recent client.

He's preferring to use closed source viscosity over their open source client.

Bitcoin just got called mallarchy by an old guy on tv. I'm pretty sure that just instantly legitimized it for everyone under 30 .

Awesome. As great as the Bitpay service is, it seems like what this subreddit is ultimately rooting for is there to be no need to use the service.
Edit: Converting it to business expenses like gas, air travel, and hotel rooms seems to be the way to go unless you can't afford the price volatility.

I'm assuming those 500K BTC sells caused a few people to panic, and then the lag made everyone else panic.
Edit: 5K bitcoins worth $500K at the time, Sorry.

Just bought 35 BTC from them this morning through wire transfer. They also accept bank deposit. Bitcoins were in my account in less than three hours after wire transfer. You have to make sure you are very familiar with sending and receiving PGP messages, but that's something that is useful to learn anyways.
Edit: The 1% extra bitcoins you receive through wire transfers, and 1.5% extra you receive through bank deposits  is also quite nice :). Bank deposits should give you bitcoins almost immediately. USA based bitcoin supplier. They are not an exchange, don't charge any fees, they just give you bitcoins quickly based upon the mtgox price.
Edit 2: They just closed to new customers :(

Thanks for the correct spelling! I knew I was spelling it wrong and just went with it.

Ooops, yes. I was thinking about how when they sold it was worth $500,000

I highly appreciate every time someone mentions something like this during volatility. The people down-voting you think they are geniuses or something .

Not a problem, just give us a heads up and I will personally take care of that for you!

As long is there continues to be transparency of how the funds are used, this is much better than a lot of the other content on this sub. I'm in a good mood as well, so Merry Christmas!
