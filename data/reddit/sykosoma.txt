If you're new to bitcoin and just looking for a place to purchase at a very cheap rate from a reputable exchange Abra is the place to go. I learned about a bro from using a bluebird American Express prepaid card, Abra accepts American Express at cheaper rates than MC and Visa for Bitcoin purchase. Although I don't use it much for the exchang, Abrait is my main source for purchasing Bitcoin and then transferring to my binance account.

Sorry for late reply but yes, I'm not lucky enough to have a legit Amex credit card, but I have had the bluebird Amex for years and of you load at Walmart there is no fee. I've been using my bluebird Amex with Abra since Abra began, and then they only took Amex. But honestly always been a easy transaction. They do have a 1000 dollar a month limit. You can always get a bluebird Amex and a Serve Amex. Both work fine

Yes but I recommend bluebird amex from Walmart because they don't charge to load. And Abra is cheapest with amex for some reason

Can you verify that Paxful did have a legitimate app at one time? Because I personally have used it although it's been over a year now. If the app I did use was fake then the entire Paxful server was hacked. I was easily able to login without issue meaning my credentials were copied, otherwise how would I have been able to login correctly.
 Paxful has thousands of users and is a great platform for alternative ways to purchase and sell Bitcoin. Paxful should have a notice bulletin on their main website if indeed this is still a possible threat.

So after researching the validity of the Paxful app, results are a bit confusing. Google search does show a Paxful app but it's actually not available. When I used the app it showed the developer as being "Paxful" instead of some third party name. The Google Play app was directly advertising on the Paxful website which has is no longer found. I apologize for the misinformation. I was only referring to my experience and I never had any fraudulent activity occur within the application. I will also add that if the app was indeed fake I don't see how the app was available on the Google play store for as long as it was. Ultimately the app was any different than the website version other than being more condensed as most apps are. There is no current Paxful app period on the play store.

Abra and use any type of American Express card. Fees are around 1%

That was basically the motto for 2018. Everyone was expecting a January repeat all year. Now we are   at such a low point if it goes up a cpl hundred bucks everyone calls for a bull run. Then it drops again. Let's get back above 5k first before making any serious predictions. I don't see that happening any time soon. We'll have a few spikes but  nothing long term for at least a few more months. Basing my opinion on past chart history, which is usually the most accurate predictor for the long term.

I think your missing the point if the OP. The question is where to purchase Bitcoin at a low fee. Most Exchanges don't sell Bitcoin via fiat except for Coinbase which requires a bank account. Many people dont use traditional Banks. There are other options besides Coinbase such as Abra or Paxful where you can purchase Bitcoin with prepaid cards for a low fee.

It was featured on the Paxful website. I will reiterate again this was over a year ago. This is not a recent issue. I don't just download apps without verifying the validity if the developer.  You can believe me or not,  if you used Paxful in 2017 you may be familiar with the app.
@_date: 2019-01-21 12:08:27
Again I originally stated this was featured on the Paxful website in 2017. It was not fake at the time I used it.

Yes. I used to use a site called paxful.com and they also an app called paxful. It's a great way to purchase Bitcoin if you don't have a bank account debit card. Paxful is a user based system where other people buy and sell Bitcoin. You have hundreds of options to buy BTC. Each option has it's own exchange rate which changes based on each user. The rate can range from nearly free to very high. So it all depends on what method of payment you choose. You can purchase Bitcoin with virtually any form of digital payment, for example my preferred method was using the prepaid Bluebird American Express card or Serve Amex card, the exchange rate was usually one of the Best averaging about .05 cents to .09 cents on the dollar. These rates are usually better during day time hours, 8am to 8pm when most people are online and available. 
You can use virtually any gift card to purchase Bitcoin also but the rates are higher. I personally don't use Paxful to purchase Bitcoin anymore but it was a decent option when resources are limited. You can also sell your Bitcoin immediately for cash. 
Currently I use Abra to buy my Bitcoin. They are a new exchange with the top coins available. Again if you have an American Express card if any kind prepaid or credit card you can link it to your Abra account and purchase Bitcoin immediately for very cheap. If you do use an AMEX the fee is only 4%. If you is Visa or MC the fee is 8% Theres an Abra app on Android that I use, not sure about iPhone or online. I've been using Abra since it started just over a year ago. If you want to buy Bitcoin for nearly nothing I would highly recommend Abra and using an American Express card. Once you purchase BTC you can transfer it to any BTC wallet address or you can hold it on the Abra exchange. 
Hope I could help you out

Wow. What an indicator! It has dipped below for the first time as well. It's been within 500 to 700 +/- for almost 2 months now. BTC needs a serious breakout over 5k to see any serious bull indication.
