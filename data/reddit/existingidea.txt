What? 16 characters identical so long as you control both addresses is a collision, needing about 40 bits of work. Creating the same if you don't control both addresses is a second preimage, needing 80 bits of work. This has nothing to do with "burn addresses".

This is worse somehow.

It's the same difficulty to collide both ends. Do you have any ability to apply logic?

For collisions it's about half as difficult compared with vanitygen, which is a second preimage. It's not computationally expensive just needs to have some code written, which doesn't seem worth it in this case.

Is it, though?

The antminer s9 is 13TH/s. 
The expected generation output is 0.000455096696121 BTC per day and 1.89623623384e-05 BTC per hour.
So $2.90 per machine, per day, raw output. 
12 machines in the photo, for a total net mining output of $34. Less power, hardware cost. 
This is almost certainly just something to lose money with.

Realistically speaking, this has nothing at all to do with what you're talking about. It's a companies product that they are allowed to produce due to the permission-less nature of Bitcoin, but it does not represent the underlying decentralized network in any way. It would be disingenuous to either claim that a private companies product is the savior, or the death of Bitcoin either way, it simply exists and you're free to use it if you choose. 


The linked tweet also admits that this isn't particularly any news to speak of at all, mostly it's support being announced, on an exchange you don't use, for software that you don't have. For something that involved sending money to another destination you generally want at least two parties to make transactions between.

Why do you expect to? Just nobody wants to connect to you.

Every lightning transaction.
