What are the effects exactly? I'm a bit confused by this plan.
It will allow anyone to host a bitcoin node, correct? How does that improve the current situation? And how do they make money from it?

Yep, that socialist past is still there in some industries. One of the parties in the current government was elected specifically to break up the big banks' monopoly (and to get real estate prices down) but it's still an uphill battle.

Intel, Apple, Google, Facebook and others seem to strongly disagree with you, each of which have substantial R&amp;D centers in Israel. 
Israeli cities are actually quite a bit safer than cities in the US but that hasn't stopped companies from setting up shop in America. I know for instance that Jerusalem has less violent attacks (including terrorism or rockets as well as old-fashioned murder and rape) per capita than Portland, Oregon, which is considered very safe by US standards.

I have a question about the AI side actually, not really related to bitcoin.
Is he concerned about the vulnerability AI systems have shown to attack? I don't mean cyberattack. It's become clear in the last few years that while neural networks have some incredible capabilities, they can also be tricked quite easily (and in ways that would never work on a human).
