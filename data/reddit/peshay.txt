I just sold all my coins during that recent spike. I have now fiat spread on 5 exchanges. My thought is, if SEC approves, I still can rebuy in. If SEC declines, I'm ready to buy the dip.
I wanted to sell now to be sure I don't have to sell with loss if it falls below 1000

I'm not kidding when telling you this:
When Bitcoin Apps where not allowed in the AppStore I wrote an email about this to Tim Cook, a few weeks later they changed their App Store rules to allow crypto currency apps

People using that card, do not understand Bitcoin! Why use such a card, why not use Bitcoin itself? Just because it's not accepted as VISA ... that's what we need to change!

Sorry! You're right, I changed that in my post!

Do you get your pay check with bitcoin? Can you pay for everything you want in bitcoin? I guess not without other payment providers in between.
You have to live with what you got and can just aim to what you want.
Being a Bitcoin Nazi does not help.
At least with this app you can have an overview on both worlds, or how I see it, this one world about money.

So if I understood this correct, they showed up, because you bought/sold bitcoin worth &gt;12500EUR in a single transaction and the other trader was outside the EU/DE, is that correct? I just ask because after reading this I get afraid they show up at me as well, but I hadn't such a high trade with someone that has a foreign bank account.
