Thanks for the response! Yes, I understand that the use of credit cards still isn't ideal. But you can already use them to buy bitcoin in some places. 
Do you know if a system like the one I'm asking about exists?

Seems like it is really hard for you to understand my question... Ok - for example - this image shows how you have to pay with bitcoin at overstock.com. 
This is FAR from automated, and it requires that the customer has a lot of understanding and comfort with bitcoin. No thanks for me and for most consumers.
My question is if there is a system that merchants can implement on their website where customers still pay with bitcoin, but just through inoutting their credit card number on the checkout screen, and without independently needing to purchase bitcoins?

Thanks! Yes, I dont fully understand yet, which is why I came here to ask. I understand this is why bitcoin exists, but I am looking for something that is so automated that it doesn't feel like either the seller or purchaser is using bit coin.
Could you point me in the direction of an automated system that:
Buyer makes credit card payment -&gt; auto buy bitcoin behind the scenes -&gt; auto transfer bitcoin to someone else -&gt; auto sell bitcoin and deposit cash with seller.

In short for you - I UNDERSTAND THIS. Do you understand that most people still buy bitcoin with funds from their bank?
