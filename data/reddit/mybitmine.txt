I very much agree and I'm not a graphics designer at all! Which is why I wrote in the main topic, that anyone is welcome to chip in and create some graphics for the site. I will of course give credit to those who help out.
I am currently redesigning the site, but if you are still interested then I'll provide you the new dimensions for the images that is needed. Or you could wait until later today when I most likely release the new design.

As I mentioned in the post, the contest will last until November 16th at 18:00 UTC
And score is based on a secret so no one has any advantage. It however takes into account how active you are, your resources and your upgrades. However, the score system will soon get changed because it is rather simple at the moment.

It's the current score system which might be flawed combined with the fact that the converted some Bitcoin to resources. However, I am working on a new score system which hopefully will even out this huge gap between players.

Amazing, that is just wonderful! I hope you noticed the dimensions for images on every picture. You are 100% free to think of the motive as long as they make sense - my sketches are only meant as placeholders. I am looking forward to seeing what you come up with!

I am happy that you like the general idea. Hopefully I get some suggestions to make the site even better :)

I will take your suggestions into account. Please keep in mind that this is the first release of a game in a very early stage, so I will change a lot of the things which run the site. Thank you for your suggestions though!
Also, can you show a screenshot of the improper rendered score table? On my machines it seem to work fine. I am working on a new design though, so maybe this will just be temporary.

Well the score system also takes activity into account. However, as mentioned in other replies - I am currently working on a new &amp; improved score system which makes more sense to users.

The design has been completely renewed and the score system improved.
 Hopefully someone better with design skills comes along to pitch in.
