I hope you're kidding. This sounds positively retarded.

Oh brilliant. So I've got a little story related to onecoin. Last time I was traveling to the airport, I got an Uber. After speaking to the Uber driver for a short while, I landed on a common topic:crypto currencies. I told him about bitcoin to which he responded by explaining to me how faulted bitcoin is, his argument being there's a limited amount of bitcoin. He expanded by telling me about onecoin. One of the main features apparently was that there are more coins in circulation, how very interesting. He then proceeded to tell me how he puts money into credits which are worth however many coins(red fucking flag right there). I asked him where he keeps his coins and he said that he sinoly logs into the website to look at them. Cue the story about how you don't own your coins if they are on an exchange. The driver looked a little concerned at that point and asked me to go into more details about hardware wallets. I didn't know anything about onecoin at the time but it was sounding like a shitty scam. Before I got out of the cab, the Uber driver shared about his hatred of banks and how he's keeping a hundred grand worth of onecoin as savings.. Poor sod.

After writing such a huge wall of text, I'd gild myself too.

I'll put on my tinfoil hat and pay more securely for my online shopping!

I'm most likely going to do that as well, however I'd also like to be well informed as to the way I can turn this back into flat currency for a profit(hopefully).

Sweet, that makes more sense now!
@_date: 2016-06-12 18:45:17
Mm fair enough. I will try to use it for goods and services. I bought from local bitcoin 
@_date: 2016-06-12 18:55:35
That makes sense, thanks! Still learning the ropes.
@_date: 2016-06-12 17:47:10
Yes, the question is which ones are the best value/easiest to use.
@_date: 2016-06-12 20:17:50
Could you elaborate?

I've bought £200 worth of btc on circle now and deposited it into my Copay wallet. Any idea when I'll be able to increase the limit?
Also, I attempted using coinbase earlier but had a problem verifying my identity  lol.
@_date: 2016-06-12 17:11:57
Awesome, thanks! 
I actually ended up buying 5BTC on LocalBitcoin. 
Do you think they're more secure in the LocalBitcoin wallet or my Copay wallet?

The brainwashing is in full effect. 
Please don't invest in technology thinking it will make you rich. Assume whatever money you put in, has been lost and check back in a few years..

BCHcoin, pronounced as bitchcoin.

I attempted to purchase a laptop on the dell website(uk) but they don't provide you with an option for btc payment even tho they're supposed to(according to the wiki) O.o
@_date: 2017-06-19 11:18:34
Do explain. I just checked their site and it seems like a cool concept. How do you go about buying some coins or whatever it is?
@_date: 2017-06-17 22:19:30
This could have been a good post but due to lack of explaining WHY, it's not. 
@_date: 2017-06-19 15:21:53
Hmm interesting.. Thanks for the info. Will look into it some more.
@_date: 2016-07-03 18:07:51
Your landlord accepts bitcoin? Awesome!
