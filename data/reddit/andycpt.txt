Yip. Bitcoin is in its infancy. In times of instant karma, instant gratification etc i think most of us want it working now, with no bugs, just perfect. Truth is things take time. This is a revolutionary piece of software that will get better and better over the next 2-3 years and we actually need things like this to come out now rather than say 5 years down the line when bitcoin is much much bigger and more people depend on it for everyday use. Gox sucks, yes, and the bitcoin community would be better off without them but they have taught us a few things and that is bitcoin is a fighter and simply cannot be brought down, set back sure, but it's just too damn good to be broken. I feel like I'm on a podium giving the biggest liberation speech of my life lol. Okay, deep breath, there wil be other times for that ;)

The Bitcoin Foundation is of course not at all pleased with the actions of Mt Gox in terms of the wording the used to "blame" Bitcoin itself. Read here:

Closely monitoring the situation? Huh? Are they alluding to them monitoring news reports and responding to these instead on fixing their site and paying back Bitcoins to users? Don't understand.
I don't often wish bad on anyone but for the sake of goodness and prosperity for Bitcoin I honestly hope Gox crashes and never ever comes back again. But just before that I wish they return everyone's BTC's back to them. Holding thumbs for everyone who has coins with them.
