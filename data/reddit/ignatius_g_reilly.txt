That doesn’t really make sense. There are 7 billion people on Earth, so you would need to open at least that many channels to get everybody to participate.

@_date: 2015-12-23 19:05:13
I guess the insta-halving thing is funny because it happens in such an abrupt way. This is one of the things that would deserve a hard-fork, make the supply of Bitcoin smoothly go down over time rather than have half of it chopped off every so often.
But nobody will buy it for double the price, they would go out of business before people had to cave in. There is still lots of offer from the existing pool. Also, we are moving towards the next generation of miners. That will also help absorb the hash per bitcoin ratio shock.

Yes from the point of the view of the issuer, it is uncensorable. And yes the government still retains control over its creation. Sounds like a novel, interesting application of the tech to me. OP is a fool
@_date: 2015-12-22 18:59:10
SW is a soft fork, meaning only miners need to worry about it. In practice that means this only requires most of the mining pools to implement it, which they are ready to. Bitcoin is not going to collapse because more transactions can't be included in blocks in the next 3 to 6 months.
Then the problem is not that transaction fees are rising, it's that your transactions take longer than they should. Perhaps there's a fix to that. Miners should have no problem picking up a valid and sane transaction with adequate fees.
@_date: 2015-12-23 20:29:26

The solution could go live as soon as March.
I'm trying to find a list of all unconfirmed transactions in the mempool... Do you have anything?
And at any rate, regardless of the number of transactions in the mempool, a transaction with a higher fee should always trump a lower fee one, all other things being equal. There must be something else going on with your transaction.

@_date: 2015-12-22 16:26:07
I think maximalism is the naive stance, but we can only wait and see to know for sure.
There's definitely a lot of plain shitcoins out there. There's some legit projects as well. They're also called "app coins". There's a reason for their existence.
For example, there's no reason for the price of data storage to fluctuate with Bitcoin. It makes perfect sense to give it another coin to set its market price.
It will be [hard money]( Backed by computing on the standard for smart contracts (ethereum aims to be this and they have the features, marketing, and brand to succeed) or storage (as long there's offer and demand for storage, it will be competitive, the networks are already working and people are starting to show up at the door).
The discussion has many points and I can't list everything here. But really, try to broaden your mind as to what crypto is and can be. Good luck with your investments and keen your eyes open. :)

How anybody could be against this is beyond me. Unless you have another proposal that is conservative, realistic, based on current technology, and can be implemented in a short amount of time, shut the fuck up (and do what's necessary for BIP202 to be implemented).
If even this proposal doesn't make it, Bitcoin is lost. New blockchains absolutely blow BTC out of the water, either you try to at least maintain the little edge you have, or it's game over. Sooner or later, another crypto will look stable enough to use as money, with the added benefits of fast block times, hundreds of thousands of tps, etc...

I reckon it'll happen slower than we hope but sooner than we think.

It's best to diversify your holdings for sure.

Thanks for the reference, it's interesting. I think the real impact will happen gradually after the halving happens. The sell walls will dry up and demand will have to slow or drive the price up. Most likely the latter, as you would expect demand for actual Bitcoin (and not just their value in USD) to at least stay level.
@_date: 2015-12-22 19:39:02
Only half of the transactions in the mempool are new, which means the backlog is only twice or max three times the size of a block, meaning it should take maybe half an hour instead of 10 minutes for a normal transaction to go through. Not 30 hours.
[I]( [see]( [a]( lot of room, what's going on?
Is something else is going on with your transaction? Could you give more details? I understand you don't want to give your exact transaction (private transactions can't come fast enough...) but I really want to try to find out what's causing this.

@_date: 2015-12-22 08:24:41
Where were you when Satoshi put a cap on the block size at 1mb? That's right, that was an arbitrary decision by the core developer. This is also an arbitrary decision by the core developers. That's how this seems to be working for now, because some kind of 90% community consensus will NEVER be reached. Get real.

the point of segwit is to fix transaction malleability AND it has the kicker bonus of increasing the capacity around X2 as well
there is no excuse not to pass segwit, the only people against it are shills and retards
segwit has nothing to do with the block size increase debate, it's about enabling a bunch of tech that has been hamstrung for years due to transaction malleability
this is 100% true and correct and there are zero rational valid arguments against the content of this post
edit: i will add that miners are against segwit because they are afraid of losing the fees to lightning networks, which needs segwit to run effectively. miners have effectively overtaken Bitcoin. Think of this next time you speak against PoS

@_date: 2017-03-16 05:23:27
Yeah, I observed that as well in a later comment. It's kind of a harder soft fork. 
On the other hand, in the case of a less than 51% hashrate support the UASF side will be fine as long as all major/relevant nodes agree to it. By the looks of it that should be the case as support for BU is minimal outside of a few miners. However, it will take time for everybody to upgrade
@_date: 2017-03-15 07:06:00
Except the elements falling behind in terms of segwit activation wouldn't have been an issue at all, whereas a hard fork would have lost countless wallets, exchanges, and so on since such few people agree with its premise.

And every given chain being comparatively 25x easier to fork. There's a reason it takes 10 minutes to mine a block and not 10 seconds. You don't solve capacity by just pushing blocks faster.
@_date: 2017-03-15 06:54:24
You've nailed it.
I will add that the whole signalling system is broken and acts more like a ball dragging the network down. If the rule had been "segwit will activate in one year", people would have scrambled to prepare for it, segwit would have activated, and that would have been the end of it.
Who the hell thought relying on miners to pass segwit was going to be a good idea?
Instead, some people understood signalling as a "vote" like the dao hard fork was a vote. Segwit isn't a vote. It's an upgrade.

I also would like never to raise the blocksize ever, that seems like the most elegant solution, but I wonder if that's really realistic. Nothing wrong with a well executed block size hard fork.

No, nodes are the ones choosing which protocol to use. Miners are there to provide the longest chain. Have you been into Bitcoin for long?


Yes, good riddance




@_date: 2016-01-10 10:47:26
This is such a hilarious complete misunderstanding of how it works... This is strange because the same applies to gold but he doesn't reach the same conclusion.
@_date: 2017-03-15 10:22:49
It is called a soft fork by virtue of it changing some things that old or BU versions can't use, but are still OK with.
While blocks still look good to everybody, miners do need to accept doing transactions in a different way for them to be included in blocks.


That's the thing, such a block doesn't really exist. This is more about the longest chain including Segwit transactions.
When a BU miner finds a block, it chooses not to include any Segwit transactions in it. Yes, it is a hard fork, but BU is the one hard forking by refusing Segwit transactions, not the other way around with Core refusing BU blocks (that are still under the block size limit as per the protocol).
@_date: 2017-03-13 23:03:21
This is 100% correct. What matters is the Bitcoin the nodes are using. Wallets, exchanges, etc... And guess what? Pretty much all of the ecosystem is on board with sticking with the current chain and soft forking in segwit. 
In practice, a user-activated soft fork will just kick out the BU miners out of the hashrate pool. Good riddance! Can we just do this already? Let them mine their worthless altcoin. This drama has dragged on for far too long
@_date: 2017-03-15 09:49:12
The trick is about the longest chain being Segwit. All Core nodes will keep receiving both Segwit and BU blocks and treating the chains equally, all Core nodes will be able to send and receive transactions.
The reason we wanted miners to coordinate this is so we could keep 100% of the hashrate going.
Now that it turns out we can't do this, we could get away with 51% of the hashrate, but that would be extremely risky. What if the BU chain overtakes the Segwit chain? Remember, all nodes are treating both chains equally.
I guess a UASF is indeed a hard fork in the sense that you are deciding to reject non Segwit blocks, even though they are not breaking any protocol rules. But non Segwit nodes (both old nodes and BU nodes) will still be happy with Segwit blocks, which makes it a soft fork that doesn't break any wallets or exchanges.
There is also the fact that non Segwit nodes will not be able to take advantage of the Segwit features (transaction malleability fixes and increase in transaction bandwith), but that's fine - we always knew it would take time for everybody to catch up.

Yes, segwit is not in the short term monetary interest of some miners, and their interest is not what's best for the network. That's been pretty clear.
Segwit fixes transaction malleability, which miners rely on to keep the network hostage and prevent effective second layer networks from stealing their precious fees
Can't wait for the BU miners to start their fork and measure just how much support and interest they have for their little experiment
Enough said, good riddance

Could you explain how Vitalik ever forced any fork on anybody. Specifics please. When and how did he force people to run code.
I predict segwit will not pass. It won't reach 95%. Don't get me wrong, I am 100% for segwit, but it looks like there's way too much antagonism and in-fighting (partly thanks due to insane community practices) for it to ever happen.
@_date: 2016-11-18 17:56:45

Depends how bad it gets. It's obvious that BTC has a dramatically low liquidity. It would be plain irresponsible of regulators to accept the ETF as it stands, even if just on a "i want to keep my job" basis. Heads would roll if they allowed this to happen.

That's pretty much it. There's no real way of preventing people from sending BTC across borders, though they may certainly be able to punish people doing so. Or they would do something like restrict exchanges from sending BTC to anything else than other whitelisted exchanges (that sounds silly but there's really not much else you can do).

Let's be real here and stick to the argument. 


Yes, in fact this is exactly why bitcoiners are so excited about the ETF - a massive influx of money producing the mother of supply crunches and hopefully sending the price soaring. However, the job of regulators is to be wary of the smug bitcoiners that bought before the ETF and protect investors who would buy at the top of this obviously preventable bubble.
If you can't think of any valid argument against a BTC ETF, don't bother replying as you are obviously over your head or completely biased

@_date: 2017-11-03 12:57:30
You really can't accept you're wrong, right? If miners leave the network, there is a mechanism called difficulty that will automatically adjust to accommodate for that. It's a feature. Now on the "less users" part, can you show us the numbers please? Because as far as I can tell, support is overwhelmingly in favour of the current BTC chain aka the economic majority. Any other stupid shill tricks? 
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:03:28
Fine, but running a light client like Electrum that connects to a genuine BTC node will do that for me too wouldn’t it? Running more full nodes doesn’t actually change anything?

@_date: 2017-11-03 22:49:40
Interesting thread, but we’re probably at least at 2/3 million BTC imho
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:33:25
Chains could only be competing within the same consensus set... That's how chain reorganisations work, and 51% attacks as well. A hard fork is not competing at all since it is a clear break from the network, reference clients won't accept those blocks at all no matter how long that chain is. The only way to move those nodes to S2X is to install your shitty node software. Goddamn you are so stupid
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:15:02
I don’t see how running additional nodes is doing anything here. It boils down to what node people are running for their own uses. It does not matter to me how many BTC or S2X nodes are out there
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:40:38
No amount of money in the world can force people to change their consensus rules. Also, signalling is entirely non binding.
Empirically, it seems the vast majority of nodes (users, exchanges, apps etc) seem to be in support of not installing your shitty alt coin node software and sticking with the original consensus set. You seem to have Coinbase and Bitpay on your side, but we’ll see how their users feel when their coins suddenly change price and become incompatible with the rest of the BTC network.

You are a complete retard, if that were the only measure then any blockchain out there with more accumulated difficulty would suddenly become Bitcoin. The quote you put out of context is assuming you stay within the same frame of consensus rules, which S2X clearly doesn’t since it hard forks from the rest of the network. Go jump off a cliff
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:26:03
If you haven’t moved your BTC since 2009 I am almost certain those are lost, except maybe if you are Satoshi and you still have access to those. So those could be estimated as frozen in my opinion with a fair amount of certainty. 2010 to 2013 also probably has a high proportion of coins in limbo

He publicly said he did not want to collect it, that’s what the Japanese law says should happen. and it’s likely he will be redistributing it himself if he gets the chance. Before you threaten death to people try keeping up so you don’t just lash out randomly and sound like a rude imbecile
Keep in mind that would happen only AFTER you get your money back equivalent to the Yen price at the time of the shutdown (as per Japanese law again), so if you filed your creditor claim you will be getting that back too

You're right, it's contextual. Samourai Wallet crosses the line, just like removing number plates from your car.


Exactly, you wouldn't, because a private citizen owning a nuclear bomb would be unacceptable. On the other hand, a military force owning it as an entity can be OK, even really good. I bet you're really fucking happy you had something to deter Russia from dropping a Tsar bomb on your ass.

Bitcoin does not have AML/KYC evasion specifically built into the code. It's just the nature of the beast. Samourai Wallet seems to deliberately want to go for the criminal market. At least they're not denying it, contrarily to its most sycophantic supporters such as yoursef.

This is not simply a Bitcoin wallet, this is a Bitcoin wallet specifically marketed for antisocial behaviour. Going this far against KYC/AML regulations is not innocent. "Samourai" = lone hero myth, hmmm, I wonder what kind of people are into that sort of thing. If you saw a car without number plates, you would think something is wrong. People that drive without number plates on are up to no good. People that wear the full burqa are up to no good. People that don't want to identify themselves are up to no good.

Are you suggesting bigger block sizes would make it harder to verify that the bitcoin is real? Because that would be one of the most ridiculous lies I've ever heard
@_date: 2016-10-23 18:40:50
Sure, it's reductive, there are more variables at play, but it's fundamentally true that more transactions = more fees.

Eth wasn't premined
@_date: 2017-05-29 10:50:36
Too bad bitcoin is in no state to accomodate any growth 
@_date: 2017-05-31 12:49:13
it's not semantics. you're just an ignorant troll. but let's entertain your whining for a minute
a premine is when the creator of a coin mines a bunch of blocks before publishing the chain information so other people can mine as well. this results in a bunch of coins being owned by the creator before anybody else had a chance to join
in fact, bitcoin was "premined" by satoshi for a while. nobody hears you moaning about that
ethereum started with a crowdsale with explicit terms everybody knew about. the initial distribution followed the rules and everybody started with their given amount. mining was public straight away
but sure, why don't you go whine some more about storj being a "premine" as well
@_date: 2016-10-30 17:25:33
If it was "unauthorized", then nothing would have happened. People agreed to it. Consensus won.
@_date: 2016-10-24 18:48:17
Of course you don't want blocks to be too big for the network to function properly, but the optimal size is a moving target (increases with time and tech upgrades/deployment) and is certainly above 1mb. And really? Do you have the skillset and tools necessary to assay gold assets and verify their purity and weight?
@_date: 2017-05-28 13:39:31
I guess what I want to know is, is this a relevant movement or is it just chest thumping from a few people

Nice of you to play the xenophobic yellow peril angle. Really elevates the discussion
@_date: 2016-10-13 09:15:18
That makes no sense at all. If I had a billion USD I wanted to store in BTC, I couldn't do that at all. Imagine a billion worth of USD flooding the exchanges. You would make the price pump enormously. Then people would dump on you, reducing your worth dramatically. Then if you wanted to convert back to USD, the price would dump, further making you poorer. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 21:49:19
Eth wasn't premined, stay mad
@_date: 2017-07-19 09:17:30
Exactly, they will cry and scream but really it's up for people to choose JihanCoin (not gonna happen). My guess is that it will fail. Segwit2x was a way for miners to concede Segwit trying to save face as long as possible.
@_date: 2017-07-27 07:04:30
Actually, no I wouldn't. I'm not a pathetic lowlife. Sucks for me I guess?
@_date: 2016-10-23 20:22:11
Bottlenecking transactions slowly raises fees by introducing competition. Only the most "dense" or "heavy" (high fees) transactions get through. The "lighter" transactions are left out. Enlarging the bottleneck means more volume is getting through. Both mechanisms lead to more fees, but bottlenecking eventually makes the system unattractive to a growing group (when fees are more expensive than other coins).
@_date: 2017-05-30 17:33:31
Ignoring that you sound badly confused, then what does RSK bring to the table then?
@_date: 2017-05-15 11:12:15
Hmmm, I wonder about that too. Maybe they don't want $1 transaction fees and being subject to the whims of chinese miners? Gee what a mystery

I think the ETH/ETC thing is a strong signal for a surviving BCC chain. Not successful or relevant. But Wu and Ver have the muscle to push it hard enough that it sticks around.
@_date: 2017-07-03 13:53:49
Do you have any serious rebuttal to make? While it would be silly to say Bitcoin is "finished", it's hard not to conclude that high fees and the looming threat of a contentious fork incited some people to just start using other networks
@_date: 2017-07-19 11:25:03
Not sure miners "need" anything at all. They may think a particular technical change might benefit them in the short or long term, but so far they could very well stick with the status quo.
Oh they will definitely push hard for it. But they have little to no tools at their disposal for that. They can't force anybody to change their consensus set. They would have to convince exchanges, wallets, nodes, users, etc... to hop onto their 2x fork. And have everybody on that boat accept they will be severing link with the rest of the ecosystem once that kicks in (hard fork). Honestly I can't imagine that ever happening
@_date: 2017-07-19 08:27:04
Once segwit happens, there won't actually be a requirement for 2x? I mean miners can do whatever they want but really that's their initiative and their problem?

I have read a lot of arguments for and against PoS and based on prior examples (NXT, peercoin, BTS etc...) and the exciting research (Casper) going on at the moment I can not seriously believe Proof of Stake is a proven impossibility.

I think people are tired of the yelling and shilling. Once cross blockchain bridges are built (melonport, tenx, etc...), people will be able to use their coins and tokens on any network they please.

This is because people have realised Bitcoin is not scaling and is too expensive, so they leave for other networks. It's not rocket science. Hopefully UASF will be the game changer. Otherwise we are due for more months of stall and uncertainty. This is not going to play in Bitcoin's favour as a leading ledger.
