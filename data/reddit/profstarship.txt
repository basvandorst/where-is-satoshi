I think this argument is flawed. If anyone is consuming their investment based on interest rates than their investment is shit or they weren't really investing. The real problem with perpetual growth is that it is creating growth through debt. At the macro level they encourage companies to invest in growth using debt instead of cash. At the micro level the encourage consumers to take on debt which further fuels corporate growth. While for many these can be influential factors, is really the APR what keeps you from buying a brand new car every year? is the interest rate of your CC what makes you decided to invest in your 401k or go on an extra vacation? That is definitely some weak willed shit if your making your purchase and life decisions based on the daily fed rate.

What actually insane about it is that when they started dumping BTC was at 8k... shocking how much the market has actually been absorbing. Once they are done dumping its moonshot time.

I literally withdrew 700 dollars in Seoul yesterday, 4/14/2019 from an ATM with no "proof". I was kinda worried cause it was sunday and didnt know what the ATM limit would be. 700 is not even the biggest option on the machine it goes to 1 or maybe 2 thousand. Never tried that much. But what a weird and specific lie to tell...

The only such limits I've ever seen or heard of are on 3rd party ATMs, but I think its just to preserve the cash to charge more fees to more customers before it runs out. Never had any issues with going to my bank ATM.
