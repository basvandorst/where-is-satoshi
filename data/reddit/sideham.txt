I must have read the same reviews as because everything I read was like hey, stay away, these cards come from third parties and they could have written the numbers down.
How do they address that? Do we know?
@_date: 2015-01-26 18:52:58
They aren't different. You are giving them the platform. They use your name.

This isn't the first time he did this... just in the past week.
He has made a lot of threats against Coin Fire but they haven't made any comments on them.

Coinfire posted about SEC letters going out to crypto 2.0 companies. People said FUD, then wired published this piece with a small gem in it confirming the report: 






If the people of Hashtalk truly believe this guy *isn't* plugged in to the right people at these regulators they are simply ignoring the facts that this guy has delivered repeatedly claims of actions and later been proven to be right.
@_date: 2015-01-21 21:31:28
That was very well said and I think sums up how a lot of people feel. Especially after the recent advertisements they've been running for GAW and then the story about Scott Fargo or whatever his name was taking money that was laundered through a charity from Josh Garza.
Something just doesn't *feel* right with them. We won't even go in to the issues that they let products and services buy coverage. But, hey, it is okay because it doesn't guarantee *positive* coverage but show me a single paid for article that was actually negative.
Anyone who writes for CCN is written off by many in this community as we begin to self-police and regulate ourselves to not give them attention.
Buying hacked.com for more than 50k cost money and that money came off the backs of honest people in this space who were duped by the scams that CCN pumped and promoted.

It totally does. When everyone else was saying it wasn't true one reporter actually found someone who received it and confirmed it.
Coinfire didn't provide him the documents. Maybe something happened to spook them. Maybe lawyers said it would be a bad idea.
What about the BFL stuff?
@_date: 2015-01-20 06:56:00
What about that time they posted the FTC documents regarding BFL before they were published and public? Mike the editor tweeted pictures before they were even on government site.
Deny all you want but these guys have some *serious* connections.
@_date: 2015-01-20 06:56:28
The South takes that shit seriously.
@_date: 2015-01-26 21:01:33
The simple fact you take scamcoin XPY means I won't be purchasing.
@_date: 2015-01-26 18:52:36
Says the spammer.
@_date: 2015-01-23 10:48:01
Good to see the mods are going to let the site manager keep spamming his links here and not enforce the no-spam policy.
@_date: 2015-01-26 20:08:04
They've admitted as such in previous threads.
@_date: 2015-01-24 17:18:56
Proof. You are here reaching out because a traffic dent has happened.
@_date: 2015-01-20 06:57:06
Love that the XPY army downvoted you.
@_date: 2015-01-22 22:22:18
Totally understand.
@_date: 2015-01-20 04:12:00
They have been down this road before: 
@_date: 2015-01-24 17:18:31
This isn't paranoia.
@_date: 2015-01-20 06:58:36
@_date: 2015-01-20 10:06:19
Why are people voting up a scam site that pumps paycoin again?
EDIT: Clear spam. Posted by guy who works at site. Mods, since when is that allowed? Playing faves again?
@_date: 2015-01-22 22:22:02
Thanks for the link. Increasing my knowledge each day.
@_date: 2015-01-20 07:19:49
Fo sho
@_date: 2015-01-21 21:39:19
Not my site but I saw it as well. Sent an email asking them about it.
@_date: 2015-01-26 21:08:16
Spoken like Garza himself.
"If you don't like Paycoin or Paybase. Take your investment somewhere else".
@_date: 2015-01-20 01:20:41
He started that you were earning profits from day trading... that makes it a fund and that brings in an entire new set of regulations.
Very serious regulations.
@_date: 2015-01-20 06:57:16
This might be true.
@_date: 2015-01-26 18:52:29
Nice try what?
@_date: 2015-01-26 18:54:31
The CCN guys have been shaddowbanned. The mods keep undoing that. I'd say that is pretty partial.
@_date: 2015-01-24 17:17:04
If you look closer though most of these stories still have a slant though.
Let's take a look at some examples shall we?


You promised further updates but the moment that Josh backed out of the acceptance of that debate you never made an update to the story. It now appears Garza just suggested this thing and that Andrew never accepted.


This is not a news statement. This is an opinion.


You further perpetuate that PayBase allows for Amazon purchases when even admitted by the CEO of GAW this is not the case as the feature does not work.


Having customer names, addresses, email addresses, and account balances shown to others is not a massive data leak how? Once again, this is the personal opinion of the author and not news.


Once again, this is false. You can't do those purchases and the $20 floor doesn't exist. This was clear even then. Yet, you still reported it.
Your site was quick to point out he would address everyone but failed to mention when he didn't.
I could pull up way more URLS of very clear pumping by Scott Fargo. Why aren't you letting him go? If you are trying to be a news site then perhaps you should report news and not opinions veiled as news.
@_date: 2015-01-03 19:06:05
The community is downvoting you because we don't want sites that run advertisements for paycoin reaping the benefits of our visits anymore.
@_date: 2015-01-20 01:17:41
For the XPY faithful declaring this is FUD. If this isn't true why has Coin Fire been allowed for the past several months to keep leaking documents that have later turned out to be confirmed and real by other mainstream sources.
Why haven't GAW lawyers been able to shut them up.
I think the answer here is very obvious, because it isn't FUD. Because it is true.
@_date: 2015-01-20 04:38:13
They don't name sources who could go to jail... but this shows they've been right about previous SEC actions.
I've been following along since the days where they were two weeks ahead of everyone else regarding 800flowers. Whoever the people are at the site they seem to have real connections.
@_date: 2015-01-20 07:22:58
He is one of my favorite trolls though if I had to like a troll.
@_date: 2015-01-24 13:34:04
How mods allow the manipulation of this sub from CCN shocks me. Just the other day literally the owner of the site was submitting his own shit and spamming the site.
@_date: 2015-01-20 01:20:46
Just the fact the last SEC document dump they provided was verified as real by Wired and others? I'd believe it. Perhaps someone at Coinfire is banging someone at the sec. Who knows. They get regular scoops and after they were proven true before i am inclined to believe this.
@_date: 2015-01-26 18:53:22
Want me to google it for you? Dude, look around. The same guy who claims Asians are smelly etc
@_date: 2015-01-24 17:17:54
At least four CCN authors have been attacking Coin Fire this week. They fired one... the others are still employed by the site.
This is clearly just a move to try and repair a broken reputation.
@_date: 2015-01-24 17:19:08
How much of that news is paid for?
@_date: 2015-01-24 17:07:11
Can you explain why you and other CCN authors have been spamming reddit with your own links?
This is a very clear no-no regarding spam.
@_date: 2015-01-20 10:07:52
I went to the  IRC room on freenode. They openly confirmed Paybase was violating TOS. I don't think this was a secret.
@_date: 2015-01-24 17:21:24
False transparency. Ask who really owns CCN.
@_date: 2015-01-24 17:21:50
Also, who owns your site. For real?
@_date: 2015-01-26 18:53:57
It doesn't take much. You can buy bots online that will look for certain domain URLs on reddit and downvote them. Super easy.
