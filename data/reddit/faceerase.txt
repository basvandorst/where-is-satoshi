Honest question as someone who’s only been following for 6 months or so. 
Have the scaling issues been this bad before though?  Just curious to have some perspective on this

**It’s fucked up because it’s illegal for them to push regulated securities that they own... so they’ve figured out they can do this with unregulated currencies they own**. Section 9(a)(2) of the Federal Securities Act of 1934:
"It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or of any facility of any national securities exchange, or for any member of a national securities exchange -- To effect, alone or with one or more other persons, a series of transactions in any security registered on a national securities exchange or in connection with any security-based swap agreement (as defined in section 206B of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act) with respect to such security creating actual or apparent active trading in such security, or raising or depressing the price of such security, for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of such security by others."

Thanks BCH for the bitcoin dividend lol.  Just sold mine

Yes.  This.
Every question they ask him, notice how he doesn't really answer but just tried to steer the conversation back to why Bcash is so great?
I mean, I hate him... but it's a smart strategy.  You're on national TV.  Traders have CNBC on in the background.  Just say "Bitcoin Cash" as many times as possible so that's what gets through to people

Don’t invest what you don’t have.  Sure, it could hit the moon.  But it could also go to $0.  
What if the government regulates bitcoin?  What if there’s a flaw discovered with bitcoin?  What if your money is stolen from your wallet?
You really want to be paying for that for the 1.5 years?
That would sucks just as much as if you took out a loan for a car, got only liability insurance, and then wrecked your car right after buying it..  still having to pay it off but not reaping any of the benefits

Wire transfer.  Have to pay coinbases’s wire transfer fee and your banks fee as well.  Should show up the same day
The fees were worth it for me during a dip

Not sure why this is getting upvoted.  Another comment below that links to cell phone hijacking is the correct answer
Spoofing only fakes the phone number it’s coming from.  That can’t intercept text messages that were sent to you.  
However, if someone hijacks your phone number.  For example, tricking Verizon into thinking you’re the customer and assigning a different SIM that belongs to the attacker to your phone number.  
It even happened to the FTC’s chief technologist

Idk I just sold half of my BTC And ETH because I think it’s in a bubble and due for a correction.
I’m pretty sure it’ll recover eventually after a correction, it’ll just take time.  
However, so many of the people buying in right now don’t know shit about BTC.  They don’t care about using it as currency.  They just see how much it’s gone up on CNBC and are buying in because of FOMO.  Once we have a major dip, I’m not convinced these people will HODL.  
No fucking way am I shorting though.  I’m still hoping it goes to the Moon.

Hello, I am Judge presiding.  You may be seated.
Before me I have the litigants, plantiff and defendant is demanding that prove his/her ownership of bitcoin, to prove that is not a troll on behalf of After reviewing the evidence before us, including defense exhibit A, post history.  While it may not be entirely true that owns "more BTC than 99% of people on here", I find, that on information and belief, that the defendant does own some bitcoin.
Based on the user's post history, I also do not find him to be a troll for While does post on that sub, appears to be more of a lurker.  In fact, often has critical commentary of on that sub.  I do believe that plantiff may have got heated and that user's comments may evolved into a "pissing contest".
I find in favor of the defendant.  This finding is not appealable in any court of law. Reddit court is adjourned

Bcash forked from bitcoin on August 1st 2017.  If you were holding bitcoin at the time, you had an equal amount of Bcash.  However, if you didn't have it in a wallet and your Bitcoin was with an exchange, you didn't have access to this.
A lot of people complained that CoinBase wasn't giving them access to their Bcash, that they were essentially stealing it.  So, a while back Coinbase announced by the end of the year, they'd be allowing anyone who held Bitcoin on August 1st to withdraw that amount in Bcash... sometime near the end of the year.
Now that it's listed on Coinbase, anyone who had Bitcoin on August 1st with them can sell that qty of Bcash.  Adding a lot of supply to the market will most likely cause the price to crash.

I wouldn't be surprised if we're losing people to alts.  What good is a currency that you can't spend?
I wish that we'd like.. try to figure out a way to solve it instead of just calling someone a troll for being on here.  Although I wouldn't be surprised if they're intentionally targetting us.  
Whenever I look at that sub, it feels like every comment is a critique of what we're up to.  Like we're the hot girls in the lunchroom living our life and they're the ugly girls in the corner jealous of us and commenting on everything we do.  
I was we were doing more to push forward LN, not that I know what could be done to help that along.

Can you afford to lose all 10k?  What position would that put you in?  That’s how you should be thinking.
The market is due for a correction...

@_date: 2017-12-19 00:46:18
Yes, the opportunity to make more money or lose your money.  You don’t know how the market is going to go.  Be careful, people see the crazy returns that bitcoin has had and they have extreme FOMO, which is partly which has driven up the price in the last few weeks.  It won’t sustain itself though.  There will be a correction.  It wouldn’t be the first time the bitcoin bubble burst.. and it won’t be the last.
You can really afford to pay ~$600/Mo to pay off this loan?  Maybe just put $600/Mo into buying bitcoin.
