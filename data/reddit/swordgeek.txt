OK, thanks. That's a great rule of thumb, except that it requires me to remember or count the number of transactions that came in. Still, better than nothing.
As for the fee, I have no idea why it kept coming up with that. I didn't have anywhere  CLOSE to 900 coins, or a tenth of that. In fact, I have barely a hundredth - I'm *just* into double digits (having sold about 15 of them at $140. Sigh.)
Now once I have them all transferred to a new address, will a future fee be based on the number of transactions that acquired them over time, or the single transaction of transferring them to the new address, (i.e. future transactions will be much smaller)?
And also, doesn't this system mean that the most common source of bitcoins out there (faucets and micropayments) is also the most expensive to the network? Does that expense eventually get buried?
@_date: 2014-04-27 15:51:10
I hope so. I really hope so. But so many people are saying that we're there, and we just aren't.

Some of them are "legitimate", in that they'll actually pay out what they say they're going to pay out. Some of them don't pay out at all, some of them charge fees, some of them have a minimum payout value that vastly exceeds a reasonable amount of effort (cleverpuffin.com), some of them start out with a really high payment schedule, but then cut it down to nothing when they realise they can't afford it (cleverpuffin.com), and some of them restructure their sites, leaving everyone who had accumulated coins towards a payout SOL (cleverpuffin.com! Noticing a trend yet?).
None of them pay out enough to be worth your time. Let me put that in bold for you: **None of them pay out enough to be worth your time.** I figured that if you collected at the current rate for a while and afterwards the price of bitcoins went up to ten thousand USD ($10k/bitcoin!), you'd have just barely made minimum wage during the time you got cash from the faucets. In other words, you're getting paid about 1/13 of minimum wage on the faucets.
@_date: 2014-04-27 15:50:34
Nope. Really and truly, 0.0485 BTC. Yeah, there's about 2BTC I've got from faucets over the years in tiny increments, which will push the transaction size up.
But there you have it - the transaction size is somewhat independent of the bitcoin volume, which is crazy.
@_date: 2014-04-29 02:45:18
Thanks. I didn't really object to paying fees, but I objected to (a) paying twenty bucks in them, and/or (b) not knowing how much would be enough.
@_date: 2014-04-27 04:36:05
In the context of "Bitcoin is too complex for general consumption," this post proves it in spades. Maybe it's fair if you are planning to get rich on bitcoins, but as a general currency is untennable.
@_date: 2014-04-27 04:31:12
Maybe so-I'm not yet convinced,  but it's possible.
As a consumer though, my reaction would be "great - call me then."
@_date: 2014-04-27 04:44:04
Yep, and the real problem is the disconnect between  the people who use (or mine/hoard) it and the people who simply want to buy stuff.
@_date: 2014-04-29 02:42:51
That was exactly my point - Say I have a wallet with ten addresses, and a bitcoin spread out amongst them. The amount (1BTC) is irrelevant - the cost to transfer it is based on how I accumulated it; AND, the very common faucets and pay-per-action websites tend to pay tiny tiny amounts many times over--which leads to large transactions and thus large fees.
But my question was: If I transfer that bitcoin, accumulated by hundreds of transactions into dozens of addresses, to a single address in a single transaction, AND pay appropriate fees for it, then when I go to spend that bitcoin again on something, will it carry forward the 'baggage' of having originally come from tiny transactions, or will it go out as being the result of a single transaction?
@_date: 2014-04-27 04:41:09
This is from the default rate in bitcoin-QT actually. But that proves my point: I have 'n' bitcoins that I want to transfer. How much is it going to cost? "It depends." Not a good answer.

Of course - email addresses are a dime a dozen. Spam-free ones are precious.
@_date: 2011-09-02 03:32:28
So an update on this question.  
freebitcoins.betcoins.co is back-ended by "super rewards." I've talked to them on each disputed claim, and they've very quickly responded, looking for proof that I'm telling the truth. One of the claims they've paid out on, the others they're apparently investigating.  
  
The others, freebitcoins.org, haven't yet acknowledged my email, or apparently acted on anything. However, they have one advantage over betcoins: they have a big "pay out now" button, whereas betcoins.co has no apparent way of paying out on demand.  
  
The bottom line is that I'll harass them for every bit of work I've done, and then get my coins and go. Signing up for offers and collecting coin in my spare time is one thing, but if I have to chase down every single 'reward' after the fact, it's definitely not worth it.
@_date: 2011-09-01 02:33:27
Well OK, it's not free. You have to work for it in one way or another - usually by filling out surveys, playing some silly game, that sort of thing.  
  
What I'm wondering is whether they actually pay out the coins they promise, and if they do it without having to harass them every time.
@_date: 2013-12-28 00:51:46
1) Most don't pay you shit for your time - the only way you can get a decent payout is to collect a bunch now, and then wait for the bitcoin to hit $10k.  
2) How many of them actually pay out? I've found that the ones which pay to a microwallet.org wallet are pretty good (and once your wallet gets big enough, microwallet *does* pay you). The ones that pay directly have unreasonably high minimum payouts, so you'll be playing with their faucet for weeks before earning 0.0001 BTC.  
3) Several of them will start out with a lucrative payout scheme, but change it before anyone actually gets paid out.
In short, don't bother. Don't encourage them.
@_date: 2013-12-30 17:15:04
So the cashout is 50k, plus the 20k fee? I went to cash out, and it asked me if I wanted to add the fee, but didn't give me the option to say yes.
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:20:12
I'm not sure what you're seeing, but I've neen seeing a 503 error since the day before I posted until now, and I still see it.
And I've been trying politely to get in touch with Donny for two years now, with no luck. The only response I've got has been from other people saying, "hey if you hear from him let me know - I can't get my money out either!"
So at this point, I'm just warning people to not get involved with him. He has had the nenefit of doubt, and has pretty regularly betrayed it.
@_date: 2013-12-28 00:44:58
I work on the assumption that all lotteries, gaming sites, contests, faucets, "click for bitcoins", and giveways are scams until proven otherwise. So far, I've been mostly proven right. The latest questionable one is the CleverPuffin faucet, which has been adjusting it's payouts and dwindling in value to the point that it's almost impossible to get a payout.

Security is only as strong as your weakest link; and the authorities will chip away at that weakest link until it cracks open. Always.

Consider the amount of effort to make a buck.
At ~$700, that's 1/700 of a bitcoin, or .00143; so let's round it up to 150,000 satoshi.
Most faucets pay out somewhere around 300satoshi on average. If you have 30 of them, and they take 10 seconds each, that means you'll spend 5 minutes/hour to earn 9000s. That means you'll be looking at 16 hours (round down here, because we rounded up earlier), and using 1/12 of each of those hours. Likely, this is going to be two days' worth of work.
Congratulations. Over the space of two days, you spent 80 minutes to earn a dollar.
Faucets aren't worth it. In fact, if a bitcoin goes up to be worth $10,000USD, an astonishing increase, the bitcoins you earned in those 80 minutes of effort are worth $14.
Think about that: **If the currency's value increases by nearly 1500%, you'll be making slightly better than minimum wage.**
You want to make money? Buy a government savings bond. The payout is *terrible*, but it's better than bitcoin faucets.

I get the same results from multiple places - my home internet service, work, various public wifi points.
[Here's the screen I get]( I also get the same thing for all of the deeper links that Google lists.
And it's true that he hasn't responded to the bitcoinplus e-mail address. He hasn't replied ***IN TWO YEARS!*** It he truly just walked away from it, he's negligent; but when you search for bitcoinplus information online, you come across [threads like this]( wherein people can't get their tiny amounts out because Donny was changing the rules as he went, without telling people. "Oh, you wanted your coins out? That's less than the minimum. Oh, you have more than the minimum? Well, there's a fee that I didn't tell you about, which means that the minimum is actually twice as high."
Donny is either collosally incompetent, or a scammer. Given that he presumably still has the tens or hundreds (or even thousands?) of bitcoins that other people have mined, I can tell you my opinion.
I'd love the opportunity to be proven wrong. I'd LOVE to hear that it was all a massive mistake, and that he's going to pay people out now; but I have yet to hear of a single person who has actually gotten money out of him.
@_date: 2013-12-28 01:34:21
Probably tens of thousands of Satoshi!!!
(aka a dime or two)
@_date: 2013-12-30 05:02:12
Y'know, that's awfully decent. I'm glad to hear that you're actually listening. Cheers!

Rule 2 of having money: You don't have *ANYTHING* until you have cash in your hand.
15+BTC is worth exactly nothing until you cash it in.
@_date: 2013-12-09 02:14:55
Well, I first heard about it going offline from [someone else.](
And looking around, I see that [other people have had issues with them in the past](
And let's be clear about the 'change':
1) The minimum payment wasn't mentioned until people went to cash out, and *then* it was brought up.  
2) When people had enough to cash out, *then* the (100%) fee was mentioned.  
3) The website didn't get changed to indicate this for AGES!
@_date: 2013-12-02 06:03:10
My *guess* is that Donnoy Nodolny, the owner, has packed up and buggered off with all of the bitcoins that we mined and he never paid out.
I don't think I've heard of anyone getting paid out by him. Lousy little shit.
@_date: 2013-12-30 03:31:44
So it *wasn't* unrealistic when I started mining, but now it is.
If the maximum payment of 500 satoshi is reached every single hour on the hour, that would be about six days. Six days of being at your computer every single hour without fail.
However, average payouts seem to be closer to 75 satoshi, so change that to 40 days. Every hour on the hour, without fail, for 40 days. A more realistically number would be ten payouts per day, so that gets us to around three months.
A quarter of a year of concerted effort to get 0.0007.
What I'm saying is that your faucet isn't worthwhile by any stretch of the imagination. The six-day scenario is a statistical impossibility.
As for the rewards chart, it's a big deal because the amounts (and numbers) of the various payouts determine the average amount, and thus the time to reach 70k satoshi.
@_date: 2013-12-30 02:39:28
I found the same same thing. My 'pending' transaction was cancelled, and I resubmitted it. The new transaction was (a) rounded down to the nearest 0.01, and had a 0.01 transaction fee on it. Sure glad I didn't just have 0.029, because that would get 'rounded' down to 0.01.
@_date: 2013-12-30 16:18:13
Yup. He wouldn't let you take out 0.617, only 0.61.
@_date: 2013-12-28 00:47:34
A professional trader probably has a vested interest in this sort of thin, but at the same time HELL yeah! The BTC equivalent of day traders *who know their shit* are making a killing right now, on the backs of noobs in an unregulated market.
So, are you a noob or a trader who knows his shit? The answer is simple: If you don't have over a million dollars in actual cash as a result of trading, you're a noob.
@_date: 2013-12-28 01:55:08
And in three weeks, maximum payout has dropped from 3000 to 500.
Minimum is now down to 25. If the payouts are 25/50/100/200/300/400/500 (oh, you don't list them anymore! How convenient!), then the theoretical minimum time is now 6 days, and the average is 13.
Yeah, I'm with mglachrome. Retarded.
@_date: 2013-12-13 03:39:04
I mined there for a while, then tried to cash out. Two y years ago. The transaction was "pending" for a while, so I tried to contact the owner - Donny Nadolny. No response. I tried again. Still no response. I tried to contact him in public forums. No luck.
Here's my take: **BitcoinPlus is a scam. Donny Nadolny is a thief.**
