thanks - all the gardens in the road are enclosed by other houses in a big loop and so there is no way to get through into any of them and so there is almost no crime. Sounds weird but that is how it is (based on living here for 6 years)...

I used to think this but the antminer S3 changes this. For many of the other good value miners (in $/hash), they come as servers and you need professional quality cooling to operate them. 
The S3 is small and cheap enough that you can set it up yourself and make a contribution wihtout spending lots of $$$
The main thing is access to cheap electricity - you need to either live near cheap renewables (eg iceland, norway, washington state) or from a screwed up subsidy / regulatory regime (parts of india / china) or both (UK farms).

hmmm. fireplace in most walls tho we don't use them - they are mostly to look good. The high concentration of chimneys opposite is because the houses here (in London) are very small; just one room wide.
In the winter I'll hopefully be able to heat the house with miners...

ROI is the biggest challenge and I am partly doing it to educate myself. I selected the antminer S3 because it is the cheapest miner on a hash / $ basis. However if I paid the 'normal' UK rate of about £0.15 / kWh (maybe $0.25 / kWh) then I wouldn't really make money at $600 / btc assuming historic (10%ish) changes to the difficulty.
However a friend of mine has a farm in the countryside with large amounts of solar PV. This means that his cost of juice is around £0.05 / kWh which makes the miners very lucrative (approx 1.5x over 6 months or over 300% IRR) according to reasonable assumptions.
I have them in my shed for today and tomorrow to check that they are running smoothly. On monday I'm going to drive them up to his place.

Combined these units mine approx 2.6 Thash / second (6 units at 440 Mhash / second each). The global hash rate per bitcoin.info is 175,000 Thash / second. This means I have 0.0014% share.
Miners get 25 coins per 10 mins which = 3600 coins / day. Multiplying these two gets me to 0.084 coins / day expected. 
In reality this depends on luck - in my case this is the luck of btcguild which is the mining pool I am a member of. My actual result over the last 24 hours is 0.078 coins.

I agree - dust is also an issue because it is an old brick shed (it used to be the loo / toilet / WC for the house). They are only here temporarily and I am taking them to a farm for the cheap juice.

| Is the noise really not an issue when you're inside?
Yes - in the winter this is going to be annoying if I bring them inside. I have two options:
  1/ Either I keep them in the basement and rely on a bit of the heat trickling up (old leaky house). This could make the basement itself unpleasant due to noise and heat but we don't spend much time there anyway. 
  2/  It would be better to water-cool the miners and then feed into a big passive radiator. I'm not an expert but given that there are 32 chips in each miner, I think that it would take ages to rig up cooling and so it wouldn't work unless you value your time very cheaply.

It is a house in SE1 (fairly central) but this is the shed in the back garden.
Heat dissipation is an issue - if the shed door is closed it gets too hot and the miners shut off. I have been watching the weather forecast but I don't want to risk losing the capital cost of the miners....

THanks - I'd like to claim credit but my wife does the gardening....
