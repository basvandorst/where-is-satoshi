Idk if you're serious, but its not cool to joke about less fortunate people. Still, with that said something does seem wrong if you're buying a $400 dollar phone when you're struggling to pay for groceries.

I'm not only in it for the money, but as a 21 y.o. with 5 coins this is reassuring.

Ive been buying bitcoin for about a year and a half through coinbase and circle with BoA and haven't had any problems. I'm sure others have had problems, but theyve been fine for me
@_date: 2014-12-03 18:33:17
That is... well, not exactly true either
@_date: 2014-12-23 03:31:40
If this is true then I see no point to use them. I'd (and I assume most people) much rather work with dollars than a ridiculous amount of cents. 
@_date: 2015-12-19 03:21:01
Ah cool. Well I don't have any problems with that, carry on!
@_date: 2014-10-28 05:29:25
Cool. I'm pretty much fine with that
@_date: 2014-08-13 01:20:05
Hah really people must be starting to ask themselves why this is a bad thing.
@_date: 2014-11-02 02:52:51
How soon??
@_date: 2014-10-30 16:39:41
Yeah fuck segways
@_date: 2014-11-14 04:24:22
You say you want people to realize themselves but at the same time over thinking and stressing about some plan to be people aboard. Don't worry about what other people are doing so much.
@_date: 2014-08-07 13:20:16
Hope so though. Wouldn't mind spending some time in london.
@_date: 2014-11-10 00:29:08
.35 would only get you one of those mini poser doughnuts 
@_date: 2014-11-13 14:36:31
I think many would disagree. Let's keep the posts focused on substance
@_date: 2014-10-12 05:35:15
This is the kind of thing that will take us places.
@_date: 2014-11-30 19:28:35
Sure, but the deals they did have were very specific. They really didn't have much appeal to everyday shoppers which is why I think most people were disappointed. I was planning to buy a few things from them expecting say a 10% discount for using bitcoin, however, I had to shop on Amazon to find what I wanted through gyft.
I guess this still works but it really doesn't feel like you're using Bitcoin when you have to to buy gift cards to work your way around it.
@_date: 2014-11-12 06:45:43
You really want it on facebook? I say lose that site altogether 
@_date: 2014-11-10 00:30:28
Then buy govt bonds with them
@_date: 2014-12-23 21:58:42
Wouldn't the price have to rise significantly until we can compare them? I just think it's too hard to gauge value with numbers that high for people to start preferring it.
@_date: 2015-05-21 13:14:45
Thanks. I appreciate the explanation, but it could do without the smug attitude. I figured people would assume I meant $10 in bitcoin but apparently that's too much to expect. I admit I overlooked that piece, but I still see a big issue with what happened. If I send $10 worth of bitcoin, I should expect to receive $10 worth of bitcoin. If I am paying for something, can't the seller just chose the rate that is more favorable to them? If their exchange rate is lower, doesn't that mean I have to send them more bitcoin that are actually worth more elsewhere than the products listed price? Seems like it could get shady.
@_date: 2015-05-15 19:01:53
Starbucks customers have very different opinions of what decent people are I guess.
@_date: 2015-05-14 14:09:47
This is a completely different breakthrough. In that time Napster was big, but this eliminates the need for it when listeners can get music directly from the artist, while they could possibly make a living just from tips if there is enough adoption. Imo this is way bigger than napster.

Where's the line between good service and a bribe?
@_date: 2015-05-21 13:07:05
Yeah my bad, I should've said it was in bitcoin. I'm pretty certain its the same amount in btc, so I guess i didn't lose money exactly. Something just seems off about how different the rates are.
@_date: 2015-05-15 22:41:14
Gotcha. If word of mouth works with other things though why dont you think it will with fold?
@_date: 2015-05-14 02:06:05
This may be the revolutionary turning point of the media industry.
@_date: 2015-05-21 13:03:04
Bitstamp. I'm not sure what the default is, but i don't remember changing it.
@_date: 2015-05-21 12:02:20
I think bitcoin would be pretty solid to get some roads built. There could be a bunch of crowdfunding things like roads or building schools etc and people could maybe vote with bitcoin which ones they want to see completed. 
@_date: 2015-05-21 16:08:07
Hah well said I guess Ill blame myself then! When you compare it to other commodities it makes a lot of sense. I've used coinbase and had them bump up the exchange rate right when I was about to buy a few times, so I worry if businesses can do something similar by choosing the favored rate. No hard feelings I am fairly young. Im still in college and know I have a lot to learn, but I'd rather not be looked down upon because of it. Thanks for the help!
@_date: 2015-01-14 22:14:23
I highly doubt your reddit account age is directly proportional to rational thought. Probably the opposite...
@_date: 2015-05-15 19:07:34
So nobody has ever recommended a product to you who hasn't been paid to do so? Ever?
@_date: 2015-01-27 14:19:37
I feel like we could start a new sub for bitcoin art and work it sort of like this. People just post their work and viewers tip as they please. It would be great if people could eventually live off that as an income.

They also lose money from people having access to free 2 day shipping without prime membership

Bitcoin is far from Earth's entire money supply.
@_date: 2015-01-15 03:19:59
Maybe the top is just getting higher.
@_date: 2015-01-14 22:31:27
Fair enough. After reading some more of his comments I think you may be right.
@_date: 2016-06-02 16:28:12
Short term, maybe not. But if you can be patient I believe it's a good idea to get some Bitcoin. I'm no expert by any means, but I would suggest just buying a couple hundred dollars worth now to get the feel of it. Then every paycheck you could put a part of it into Bitcoin. Slow and steady.
@_date: 2015-08-05 02:36:56
How do i know you're not lying right now?
@_date: 2015-07-22 02:41:00
No worries, I'll be relying on my job still for income. I make clothes in my free time mostly for fun, but I figured it would be cool to sell some for bitcoin since I don't have enough time to serve many people. Thanks for your concern :)
@_date: 2015-07-31 15:06:49
No not really as a whole, but I think businesses that accept it could certainly benefit from marketing the benefits.
@_date: 2015-07-29 13:19:45
Would you please clarify how the blockchain would allow division of labor? The concept is very interesting.
@_date: 2015-07-13 20:49:04
Seems like it.
@_date: 2015-07-22 02:46:50
Great, thanks! I'll look into getting one for sure.
@_date: 2015-07-21 20:09:21
Hah that's actually the point! Im in college and make some clothes in my free time so i dont have enough time to handle many customers. I also would rather not deal with credit card processors. Thanks!
@_date: 2015-07-22 03:05:27
Lol too funny

Aka we are currently broke but will still buy bitcoins!

You live life on the edge. I like you, brainguy.
@_date: 2015-04-30 16:03:10
Thanks. Honestly I'm more confused now though. This dude didn't seriously mail his credit card did he..
@_date: 2015-04-21 15:12:49
The idea is to have bitcoin already accessible like you do with bank funds. Its not like you'd say you left out the hardest part of working a week in order to have money to pay for things.
@_date: 2015-09-24 04:41:47
Cool. So, bitcoin is just the first then?
@_date: 2015-09-09 04:55:51
Do you think bitcoin would be more or less useful/popular if it was completely anonymous?
@_date: 2015-04-06 18:15:39
Lol at least he's talking about alcohol and not cheese. How is that more relevant?
@_date: 2015-04-06 19:53:32
Still, I think he is very relevant saying that if you buy a very expensive bottle of whiskey, chances are, you will make yourself think its better so you don't feel like you wasted so much.
@_date: 2015-09-16 19:30:17
Shit is hype, yo.
@_date: 2015-04-30 13:44:03
How is it a scam? So what if a company doesn't want to hold bitcoins yet. It's better than nothing and a nice way to ease into the new environment.
@_date: 2015-04-14 16:10:56
Agreed. Buying low is a terrible investment strategy.

@_date: 2015-11-05 02:46:05
Yeah, I hope its not disaster but i know what you mean. It seemed like 200-250 was such a good stable point where we were getting out shit together and now it seems like a flood of people who don't really care so much are coming in. Though we can't be too upset with a price boost i guess.
@_date: 2015-11-04 20:18:57
Just don't wait too long if you truly believe in the idea of bitcoin. I think to really invest in it takes more than just putting money in and hope for a return. You have to realize that if bitcoin really succeeds, there is no need to cash out. I'm a little worried because it seems like many people are just looking at bitcoin as an investment that will make them money but the possibilities are so much greater. Im worried people will be dissatisfied or made the profit theyre looking for and just pull out of the game while its just really getting started.

Make a new wallet so you can send it to yourself, not a stranger

What else would you rather spend money on than that!
@_date: 2015-10-12 13:38:24
Its really clear that you should backup your coins though which is a far better failsafe than a popup warning. I'm sorry for your loss but that exact reason is why the push so hard to back up your wallet.

Marketing major reporting for duty. Not that I can help much lol
@_date: 2015-10-07 13:36:56
Won't Bitcoin supply essentially "change" with the halving? Or maybe when all coins are mined?
@_date: 2015-03-17 17:41:25
Great I like the idea of designating wallets for specific uses. Thanks ill look into that, maybe I will go for a trezor. You can still back them up like a regular online wallet right?
@_date: 2015-10-12 23:57:34
Great answer, thank you.
@_date: 2015-03-10 12:31:40
No reason to put down positivity. Please be respectful.
@_date: 2015-10-12 22:02:24
But what would happen if it took over as the global currency and we began to price goods in terms of bitcoin? How would we handle the volatility if a store priced its items in bitcoin. That is the goal after all, isn't it?
@_date: 2015-02-02 15:10:37
Still barely worth the hassle for someone that has to take the time to even learn what bitcoin is, let alone where he/she can even use the stuff. Then they have to sign up for gyft, buy the gift card and redeem it on amazon. Not worth $10 in my opinion. Im still all for it, I just can't imagine many more people hopping on board without a more simple way to spend the things, since it is a currency after all. I think this and can't help but wonder why people are so shocked we havent hit the moon yet.
@_date: 2015-02-05 01:26:16
I agree 100% but before I actually have something concrete I don't want to disclose anything just yet. However i n the future I will if it turns out it is too much for me to get started.
@_date: 2015-10-22 00:24:07
Brush your teeth with it.
@_date: 2015-11-05 20:38:55
Maybe bitcoin isn't a game?
@_date: 2015-02-05 02:13:06
This is very possible :/
@_date: 2015-02-05 21:40:36
Very true. Personally I would. Im just saying I feel like a simple google search would turn most people off. I think some might not even be willing to use a gift card at all, let alone bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-02 15:02:59
Everyone should just chill and tip whatever they feel. There isn't going to be only one magic tip amount that instantly makes them jump on board. There is no need to try to rush people into a system  where we can only spend it easily on a few select websites. Let them come when they are ready, and the btc ecosystem is ready for them.
@_date: 2015-02-12 13:07:39
