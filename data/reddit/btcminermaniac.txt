Probably the smartest thing someone has said in a while! The price is volatile based on perceived notions and opinions, not on actual value or worth at this point in bitcoin's history (or at least in part).

I agree with what the others below said: It is more than likely lost forever in the blockchain (probably should use bitcoin core, Mycellium, nano ledger, etc.-I've never had any problem whatsoever with any of these, and transfered around thousands with them).
Sorry for the bad news :-(

The Chinese and I are in agreement this time :-)

People should think before they speak. I am running several bitmain s3s, over-clocked. I am getting the power from a 'renewable' energy source (solar right now, but working on the 'Magni-generator'). So how am I not making anything?

Yes, this would not be good for bitcoin, in my opinion (it would make it more like a 'centralized' currency as well, which is what the developers of bitcoin were wanting to avoid).
The fewer people that have all the control, the better.This is essentially the idea behind P2P systems, that no one node ( or group of nodes) can control or create a 'log-jam' in the system.

Bitcoin is volatile for many different reasons.If you think about it, it is the beginning of a new era of binary currency, and like all things at the beginning, it has its 'growing pains'.
That being said, it can be manipulated to some degree, but that is true of any currency.My fear in that regard is that the top 2 or three companies could in a way influence this heavily if they gained a significant market share-like above 51%.

Interesting scenarios. Consensus should always rule, and there definitely has to be a block size increase of some kind. I don't know if its the complete answer, but Jeff (BIP 100) is definitely on the right track!

Dude, I don't even understand what you're talking about.Could you please speak English?

Good God, that's the last thing we need: more government regulation :-( Especially on something like this.

I also signed this, because I support the bitcoin cause, and I am a programmer myself and can appreciate the intricacies of the bitcoin core protocol/implementation(Bringing together diverse computer technologies all into one package, so to speak, to produce it).
I watched the episode of 'Epicenter Bitcoin' with Gavin Andresen, and I also think he is a bright programmer, as well as Mike Hearn.
So, in the immortal words of Rodney King, can't we all just get alomg? :-)

Good resource.Thanks for sharing.

This is far from 'breaking' bitcoin.Man, is this all that they can come up with? This web site should shut down if they can't get any better content than this!
Obviously, a lot of people don't realize the resiliency of the bitcoin network. I agree-will take more than a 'script kiddie' to tear down bitcoin!

Glad they're in.They can only help further the cause of bitcoin ;-)
I may talk a lot of smack, but these rich guys are at least pursuing something worthwhile ;-)
