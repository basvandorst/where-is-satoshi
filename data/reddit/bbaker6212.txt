I neither live in USA nor am I a customer of Coinbase. So it does not apply to me.  Who's he fool now?

They're obviously not upset ENOUGH to actually do anything about it (take action), other spend 30 seconds typing out a complaint on the social web.

Hard to feel sorry for anyone who makes such a mistake.  Not forgiving BCH's "robbing" of the bitcoin name, but noobs need to educate themselves about things before they risk their money. Anyway, they may end up making a profit on their mistake so there's that.

How many satoshis is that vow worth?  And even if they threw some skape-goat under the bus, they still get away with a sheet-load of money.

Installing a virtual machine is much easier, using free VirtualBox. You can take snapshots of the fresh installation and revert back to it if you need/want so you know there is no spyware.  You can turn off the network connection of the VM when you want and enable when needed.
Kraken opinion seems biased to me. It's one of the biggest and works fine for many people.

I was thinking if the PoW was changed such that it is more efficient on PC CPU's versus GPU's and ASIC's would that not allow individual Bitcoin users to spin up miners on our machines to create a "backup" of hashing power, and in essence use this as our way of (voting) for Segwit?  Would this be effective? or would this hashing power still pale in comparison to the big centralized ASIC miners mostly in China?  What if 100's of thousands or millions of CPU miners were spun up?

Here's LLabs Neutrino.  Does Blockstream or Acinq have anything like this?[
"Neutrino is an **experimental** Bitcoin light client...There are multiple [known major issues]( with the client, so it is **not recommended** to use it with real money at this point."

Lightning Labs has a daemon that works without needing to download/sync the entire blockchain, right?  
I remember the name "Neutrino".  I think it might still be in "experimental" stage.  But hey, if it works it would be awesome esp for some people with slow connections.  Also, can't you use the "pruned" mode for the daemon that reduces the bitcoin database (blockchain) size to only around 4GB?  That reduces storage need though not the very long sync time.

It's a protective case for a tiny single-board-computer called a "Raspberry Pi 4". You can think of it as a very inexpensive mini-pc that has many different uses, but primarily used by hobbyists, experimenters, and tech product prototypes.. such as Network file server, IoT ("internet of things") projects, Bitcoin full-node ("be your own bank"), Linux/networking/programming educational device, etc.  I think the only thing it's can't do is run Windows ;-)

Zukaza, see my post below with Coindesk news link about MercadoBitcoin.  I think you're relatively safe using them.  IMO they are likely the most reliable in Brazil as of now.

If you speak Portuguese you can read up on the litigation and try to figure out what's going on.  JusBrasil is a site listing ongoing legal actions.  I don't really know how to use the site or figure out what's going on.  It could all be about the mess that happened back in 20012/13 with the previous owner.  I don't mean to spread rumors about MB.  I have been using them and happy with their service.  This is just to give more info for those who may be interested...

 That was back in 2012 and before the current owner took over... 
"For better or worse, the story of bitcoin in Brazil begins with Leandro César Marciano.
An IT consultant from Belo Horizonte, Marciano founded and later sold the country's largest bitcoin exchange Mercado Bitcoin following an alleged security breach, and launched Bitcoin Rain, an investment scheme suspended by the government and later likened to the infamous US ponzi scheme, Bitcoin Savings &amp; Trust. Informal estimates suggest the ventures resulted in the loss of 4,000 BTC in consumer funds.
Harder to calculate is the effect that Marciano's services had on early tech adopters who, unlike their peers internationally, may not have been able to enjoy bitcoin's meteoric rise in value to more than $1,000 at the end of 2013."

Mercadobitcoin has been under different ownership for a long time now. Those problems were from some other guy, who seems like a scammer from the stories I read about him.  He ran off, prob fleeing the police.

I did not understand this last sentence.

Looks like vapor-ware to me. They advertise something that cannot be downloaded? does it even exist yet?
