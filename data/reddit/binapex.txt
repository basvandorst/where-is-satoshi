That source seems like a good place for a novice seeking reliable info about crypto and other related staff.

The picture is funny, the situation is sad...

That is a common problem for most phone supports. They either google the solution of the problem faster than you do, or offer you to leave a written request. Nothing new.

Spending Bitcoin is the best option. However, if you are a merchant yourself, you may consider making Bitcoin a payment option.

I agree with OP. Crypto industry is not that user-friendly sphere, however, it has penty of potential for those who understands how it works.
@_date: 2019-07-03 07:30:47
I hope to witness that miracle one day.

It is your right to do whatever you want with your body, but I would suggest to think twice. Getting a tattoo with cryptocurrency is the same as getting a tattoo with your girlfriend's name. Things may change radically and you will not be able to do anything abt it.

I'd seize the moment and buy more

This world is so full of  lies!

This is a pleasant change from such traditional gifts as vacuum cleaners and blenders. I smart contract is a good idea for a gift.

What you described sounds more like extortion...

Thanks for feedback!

Try explaining that to your parents

In the near future: "Show some respect! This is a bitcoin!"
@_date: 2019-08-06 08:03:56
Crap! Here we go again!

Everyone: \*buying or selling Bitcoin\*
Me: \*just watching all this commotion regretting spending 100 Bitcoins on pizza years ago"

Bitcoin broke 12 k, but he did not invest

Hardware wallet is considered to be the safest way of storing crypto and Ledger is the most popular among them. Such kinds of wallets are immune to hacker attacks as they operate offline. By the way, keeping your crypto on exchange wallets is not the best idea.

Despite all attempts to spread crypto awareness, most people still tend to think cryptocurrency is a scam. It is upsetting that techology that has so much to offer is swept off the table just because it takes effort to understand how it works.
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:23:35
Hopefully in time people will understand how many useful things this technology has to offer. After all, there were time when people belived Internet was just a trend.
@_date: 2019-06-28 12:09:09
Agree with OP. Careful planning is the key. You can't manage or protect your funds if you have no idea of what you are doing.
@_date: 2019-06-26 09:47:38
Cryptocurrencies are not that user-friendly technology and for most people it is pretty complicated to understand how it works. Experience shows, that users prefer not to deal with something that demands time and effort to understand. For this reason I think mass adoption will not happen for another 10 years.

Just like in case with fiat money - keep all the information to yourself.
@_date: 2019-06-21 13:22:28
Really hope such ATMs will soon become a common thing. However the transaction charge could be lower.
@_date: 2019-06-28 13:12:51
Now we wait.
@_date: 2019-06-26 08:26:25
I guess people have been expecting this and when it actually happened, it was no surprise or sensation.
@_date: 2019-06-21 13:52:36
I guess the best stratagy is not to invest more than you can afford to loose. But that's just me.
@_date: 2019-06-25 07:53:05
It is not a secret that cryptocurrency is extremely volatile. Taking that into consideration, one day you may in the long run end up with nothing. Being reasonably cautious is one thing, but one should never miss good opportunities because of irrational fear.
@_date: 2019-06-28 09:40:49
I tink it goes without saying. I mean you should know who do you trust your crypto.
@_date: 2019-06-27 08:09:04
Sleep and miss the rollercoaster Bitcoin ride?
@_date: 2019-06-28 06:11:32
Didn't by any at all.
@_date: 2019-06-26 09:11:18
I tend to think that this is all due to growing crypto awareness. I mean, bitcoin is nothing new now. People have spent some time studying it, some even invested in bitcoin and another price increase is something already expected. Cryptocurrency becomes a common thing now.
