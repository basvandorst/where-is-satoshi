That's a great tip. You can never go wrong with multiple levels of security. Go for offline wallets too, they're the most secure atm

This is an awesome news, its so great to hear that more and more politicians are supporting Bitcoin. I think what I need to do right now is to wait for new ICO projects that will be launching from California.

I agree with you on this one, since most of the projects today doesn't even give a damn about their members. They didn't even give a time to time updates. I tried to invest to a project that has so many members, after a month all of their members and investors backedout because of lack of community management. All the members are asking each other on the community and the admins are just reading all the questions. Do you happen to know a company that can help them out?

 Awesome tips you have here in the article, I've been wanting to create my own blockchain marketing company or even become a marketing specialist for blockchain projects. The tips that you've given in this article are very helpful. Nowadays most of the ICO projects dont know that marketing their project is very important for them to reach their goal.﻿ That's why I would like to help them and be a marketing specialist.
