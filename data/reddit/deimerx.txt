Imagine if we had an exchange... VEF/BTC... Currently all we have is localbitcoins.
@_date: 2018-05-15 18:33:01
If I had a business I'd do it, you can "win or lose" money but it's the right step forward. Instead of doing 10-20% discount, I think I'd take the risk, that's not really a risk since I know bitcoin price will go to the moon so... Not really losing even if I sell my product below the price in worthless fiat money. 
@_date: 2018-08-02 15:08:19
Cool congrats, remember if you share the amount of BTC you own hide your identity online. Or just don't share. 
Also, cold wallet please. Electrum is recommended.

In 5 years you will see Bitcoin acceptance rise a lot, then it will be a long period where the two currencies will coexist at least for 20\-30 years, then a cryptocurrency will rule, maybe a cryptoDolar/cryptoEuro mined by the goverments? Maybe, I'm not saying it's Bitcoin although it probably is. 
Why? It's simple, the technology is better than fiat, fiat is losing credibility even without the cryptocurrency existence, but the people doesn't know how to handle the technology we still deal with people struggling using a smartphone or the internet, new generations will believe more in technology as it's happening, until everything goes to a cryptocurrency. I don't know bitcoin, regardless its popularity it has its flaws. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 18:31:44

You people need to understand you CAN'T predict the market. There is just endless variables, math isn't the tool, experience and knowledge would be more accurate and yet it's innacurate and speculative. 
So if you're not a time traveler be gone with your "predictions". 
@_date: 2018-05-16 22:17:21
Then the answer is yes. I don't think it would matter below 1k. But many people moving around 5-10k yeah, depends on the market as everything.

Stop repeating government words, the petro isnt a crypto its value is fixed to the oil barrel yet it is $60 according to them and the oil  barrel is at $65. 
It's a stupid fixed salary under a mask of fluctuating money for dumb people. That salary is going to be gone by hyperinflation in 2 months tops, do quote me on that.
@_date: 2018-05-24 11:06:19
This is actually not true, it's 1 Satoshi = 120 Venezuelan Bolivar and going up regardless bitcoin going down.
Google isn't a reliable source on this since it uses data from the central bank and government. Government is corrupt and wants to cover how bad the economy is and the central bank helps and hasn't published any data.

Wrong. Well depends on what you're selling tho, if you're selling something I could easily get in the corner store with fiat, you're doomed, but if you're selling something I want at a good price, I will change my fiat to BTC and buy that thing. It's helping Bitcoin.

Being a hodler is not about immediate time, 2-3 months or so, we will see our money in the distance. We are not losing we are refraining from earning more than we already will. True hodlers don't sell cause a fall.

Adoption won't happen if we keep saying "Bitcoin accepted" and it's just the dolar exchange as Bitcoin this is $10 or the equivalent at the moment in bitcoin. That's just bullshit. 
Adoption will happen when you say "Bitcoin Accepted" and the price is 0.001BTC, I don't care if the price of BTC is at $10k or $100K is going up or down, the price of this thing is in bitcoin. That's accepting Bitcoin not working with the exchange.

Sorry to hear dude, just so you know I'm starting a non-profit company to teach people how to use bitcoins and mostly get them through localbitcoins (although it's very easy for us), Adults struggle, 30-50+ Years old as they struggled with the internet before, now they struggle dealing with this new technology. 
If you need help feel free to contact me, I won't ask for any personal info, passwords, name, account or make you do trades through me you're free to do it with anyone you pick, I won't send links avoiding phishing. I'll just advice through text. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 12:15:13
That's fake.
The exchange here is the same as everywhere around $6100. The problem is $1 = 3.300.000 VEF and rising hourly. Your convert rate is according the government, which is impossible to get.
@_date: 2018-06-28 13:23:20
Yeah it's very confusing, government doesn't want to show official values because they are gruesome, when they do release "official" it has a hard cover of make up and doesn't show reality, that's why you can't trust. 
Just go to localbitcoins get the average in Venezuela and divide with the price of bitcoin in USD according to coinmarketcap, that way you get the USD to VEF real exchange. 
@_date: 2018-06-27 18:50:27

First of all, I believe in Bitcoin and in the blockchain technology. But you have to accept the article was right, I think there should be a way to make it more efficient, it's not "wasted" energy perhaps that's not the best term, it's energy that could have been used differently.
I don't think the article is attacking but accepting there's a problem that needs a solution but in the meantime we need to adopt the technology. Ignoring the problem like you do and saying "it doesn't matter what we do with .5% energy, what's with the other 99.5%?!" That's not it, if you blind yourself from problems you won't move forward. 
Acknowledge the problem and act in the solution.

If I have learned something from living on hyperinflation in Venezuela is, when you have the money to buy something you want get it today, because tomorrow it will be unaffordable, I know bitcoin is totally different than VEF, but it's as volatile.

There are a bunch of arguments and reason why not to invest in Bitcoin, it's not a no-brainer when we are going to invest. my point is this is the dumbest reason why not to.

A fanatic won't listen to logic It's like sports IE: A person would support a team even if it's a fact the team sucks and the team is doing bad they don't change teams which would be the logical choice, yet they're fans, they don't change their mind with logic.

Nice statement, I do understand socialism, I think socialism is a way of thought needed in democracy to make it work, I think all ways of thought are needed. 
Socilism bases on equity and there should be equity of opportunities, not outcomes, that's the trouble with socialism. I do believe government should provide the people with education, health and security in the streets, stable states of economy although the market should be as free as possible. 
The world shouldn't be socialist or capitalist or liberalist but a mix of all of them thats not left or right but middle. Neoliberalism, we need trustable leaders which neither Chavez or Maduro were, you can't deny, it's a fact that all these whatso called socialist politics in the world are just a face they want "socialism" to make themselves rich and their countries poor selling something thats highly sellable I mean socialism sounds great dude and I understand you like it, It's an idea that sounds perfect but its not possible, that's why none has done it yet, and everyone who tried is shamefully rich Like Fidel Castro, Chavez daughters and Maduro, so freaking Rich and saying "Being Rich IS BAD".

There are many Bitcoiners, they do talks and conferences, where people attend, people is interested. Miners are abundant since electricity is so cheap, (Like less than 1 cent a month)
Some other traders work as a exchange they recieve money from venezuelans in other countries and give it to their families here in Bolivares taking a fee, and getting rid of their Bolivares for Bitcoin or altcoins.
So far I've been doing individual effort mostly I started a company with a few other people, BUT I know there are some bitcoiners out there who surely want to help I wish to reach them in the near future so we can work together. Spreading the word

This is an awesome article.
Hyperbitcoinization, however, I don't think it will happen like that anytime soon I think a mistake of the Bitcoin community is to assume the thing is going to sell by itself. Not everyone is a trader, most people want "stable money" (if such thing exist), but they don't want and don't understand a the simplest bitcoin chart. 
You may say "when hyperbitcoinization happens, we won't need a chart" and you might be right! Buy whos out there explaining these people why the chart is not relevant? Not everyone has this knowledge and not everyone wants this knowledge, it's to much hassle.
Many people think it everyone would migrate to this, that this is for everyone when yet it's not as friendly as it needs to be for most people, I believe in bitcoinization but we are not there yet.

1.- Yes since 2000, Chavez and his populism the whole so called "Revolution" they stole the money. Also They deleted 3 zeros from the Money in 2008. We have had High inflation these years until total collapse. Our ministry of economy couple years ago said "Inflation didn't exist because it was something the US made up" we had no economic plans or anything.
We had this one coming, they hid the data from the central banks, and we have it worse since they are doing NOTHING to fix right now. 
2.- Industries: Polar are the biggest ones who can deal with this, coca cola, pepsi, P&amp;G and those are still up but they are running low on production. I believe to say around 80% of small private businesses have closed because they can't deal with this. 
Services are mostly owned by the government monopoly, Electricity, Gas, Water. They don't work because lack of investment and because they are basically free, without income they are broke. 
3.- USD/Bitcoin/Gold is the best store of value. Real State and Cars prices went down so so much, you can basically get a mansion with pool for $90k. Because none wants to invest in a good that has to stay here in the country. Plus car maintenence is expensive not everyone can afford, you dont see many cars outside anymore and no traffic, years before traffic was a pain. 
4 None, they don't recognize the inflation. They hide the official data from the central banks and keep everything a secret. 
5 We have had Hyperinflation since all 2018 a month wouldn't change a thing, I think i live preparing for next month and I was preparing previous month for this so I'm used, If I could in fact go back to december I would've bought and sell all BItcoins at 20k, haha.

1) Government gives Boxes of food and Regulates Food in some places making them cost less than 1cent for a kg of rice for example. With $1 you can buy enough to survive (not live well but survive). Of course this is not available 24/7 people sleep in lines and stays in them for days to buy regulated food and make the most out of their $1-2 a month.
Most venezuelans have left the country so there's a lot of people surviving on the USD their family sends from outside, and the ones who don't have that make money making the line and selling products much more expensive than they go from regulated sources. 
2.- Yes and no, yes we use it but when you are going to buy something they tell you the price in USD mostly technology, services like a lawyer they say its $80 Or the equivalent in Bolivares at the Dolartoday exhange rate the day you decide to pay, Budgets for construction for example have to be in Bolivares because governments and taxes, what they do is that Budgets expire in  1-3days if you don't pay upfront. 
3) No warning prices change even from the morning to the afternoon sometimes. There's a delay in some products, like food and vegetables, they change weekly but the price of anything doesn't last more than a week. 
4) Yeah, I will eventually I have a plan for this year, although I do love my country and I wanna work till the end of its days, I fear for my future I'm trying to do the best for it while I'm here.
Many people have left and more and more are leaving each day.
5) HA, there's stupid people still who support this government, they blame our crisis on the US and Imperialist stuff, man I don't know how those people brains work I try to put myself in their situation, they are hungry, starving, and they still support the government, they see the country as it is and they still do it... I don't know it's like a zombie for real, unbelievable. 
Most though, I'd like to believe are against, but the election are rigged, you can't trust those the Election Center is run by a government person who has been there for like 18 years I don't know. 
6) Government tried its own crypto the Petro but failed in ICO, it was a nice idea but it seems like a scam to me. Before this, they tried to send bitcoin miners to jail and they are trying to regulate it at the moment the laws behind Crypto are shady as they are in the world. But legally they are not agaisnt it.

Well I don't want Bitcoin to be Vandalism, so I think he has the IQ of a pebble therefore I shouldn't waste my time in it. 
Yet he has some point, perhaps the only thing his brain allows him to think and he heard somewhere, remember Fiat Money obligate us to use it in the country we're in and sometimes you can't even trade your fiat money to other countries fiat money! Therefore you're trapped to spend it IN that country, making you a slave of the money. (Case of Venezuela) 
It's very easy with USD basically everyone in the world takes USD or Euros (For now), but other Fiat currencies, eh, I don't think so. Fiat is slavery.

1- They are unclear about Bitcoin, they said for a time it was illegal then put some miners in jeal because they were abusing of electricity. Then they developed an ICO for the Petro thats run by them and then failed. 
Legally there are no laws against crypto, but they are unclear. At the moment you can get a mining permit from them at least so mining is legal but apparently they want to ban trading, nonsense and unclear.
2.- I believe most 90% Blame the government and its lack of policies to fix the problem. 10% Blames the opposition and the US believing government lies.
3 Noticeable sad. Increased violence yes, theft and murder for things as trivial as a cellphone. Suicide... I've heard of parents suiciding cause they cant feed their kids, I have heard of people killing themselves because of the situation they live... It's really grim and sad, media doesn't cover it fully. 
4 Haha, my salary isn't enough for food and housing, I'd say between me and my dad we need around Bs. 150.000.000 a month to maintain my family/house at least the bare min, thats like $37. It's a lot here. we do magic to fix that between my low mounts trading in altcoins and my dads job in construction we manage to have something somewhat decent. 
5 There was a revolution last year but it was shut down by death and murder from out own army, brutal repression, right now there are no opposition leaders because all are kidnapped tortured and in jail, so the opposition is divided, no signs of recovery.

In december when bitcoin was around 20k its price in Bolívares was around 3.000.000.000 Bolivares. Today bitcoin is around 8k and it's price is around 28.000.000.000 Bolivares.
Even with bitcoin dropping, it's better than keeping bolivares. 
I tell people however, that they should keep multiple ways of investment too, buy a part in USD cash and a part in bitcoin, the usd cash is safer but, you can't trade those easily and people sell only $10 bills and suchs, you cannot invest or withdraw uneven parts like $7.68, and the method of buying/selling is safer than USD black market, also bitcoin is more available than USD in the market it's hard to find someone wanting to trade $1000 for bolivares at once, none wants that kind of money in a dead currency. this is basically how you sell bitcoin here.

The freelancing is big but not as big as it should be with these salaries because internet and smartphones are less and less available (see above) it would make sense that everybody is freelancing. 
Imagine you're a venezuelan you earn money through freelancing and you're successful, you live well you can afford food, car, rent why would you stay in Venezuela? You have money you can get kidnapped outside, you can get robbed, you can get killed, Caracas is the most dangerous city in the world. Freelancers, good people, prepared people leave the county. 
As for adoption of Bitcoin, it's slow due to lack of incentives, I mean getting $10 in Bitcoin where I can lose sometimes? Not everyone trusts. Yet I've seen people from low resources and poor education considering it, telling me hey please teach me, and I have.There's one I made her puit 1.500.000 Bolivares in Bitcoin, like $1.5 and now she has like 6.500.000 Bolivares and HODLING strong.

Actually mining is not really prohibited, mining is a very profitable and clever way to do donations here, and you're right, electricity is very cheap, we can get permits by the government to mine Bitcoins yes, we could totally make this work.
However, the deal is, we can get bitcoins either from donations or mining but, what do we do with the mined Bitcoins? How do we invest this? There are many charities that buy food, give food and medicine to people and I think that's totally fine, people do need those. 
But what happens the day that food stops coming? Venezuelans starve? Do they need to depend on a charity to live? We don't want Venezuelans to depend on anyone, right now I'm thinking in offering education in cryptocurrency investing in education is the only way this money will last for a long time. We are planning an organized fund raising for this project, stay tunned.

Inflation rising to 10% is a red flag already. We had that the prices of food are the ones you notice first since it is what you buy daily. Yet it doesn't happen at the same pace and the government did things so some people doesn't notice.
Technology: Prices are the same as in USD, so they are changed hourly they always did you just don't realize that much because you don't buy a TV daily, but before some years ago when you could save and come 3 months later to buy you were like DAMN WHAT HAPPENED HERE. (Red Flag). 
Food: You see private supermarkets prices going up all the time, but the government was clever... They had regulated food, and blamed on the private sector that they were speculating with prices, saying they had the right prices under subsides, shutting people up with cheap food under the costs of state, thing they do to this day.
Services: They bought all the services having a monopoly on Electricity, water, gas. They have subsides, they are less than 1 cent a month each, you didnt see it there, although right now none of the services work I just had 21 days without water at my house, Electricity fails, etc. 
Well... Government was smart to do bad things right.. I admire their smartness for evil, and the lack of mercy they have. These people who call themselves socialist are the coldest murderers.

The problem is that with insecurity not everybody has a smartphone, with the prices of technology a wide amount of people can't afford one. I got my smartphone stolen 3 times in 2 years with a gun out on my head, right now I'm using the cheapest and crapiest smartphone I could have. 
Even though I don't carry my phone around everywhere I go because of this none does anymore, people walk in the streets scared. And if you get stolen the chances of affording a new smartphone are basically 0. 
WIth the prices and the age of technology many people are getting out of this each day, when your phone breaks by example, you can't afford a new one that's at least $100.

Not in favor, although they are right in many ways I believe a nation needs social policies along with capitalist policies. I believe the state is needed at some point.
You need social policies that provide an equity of opportunities along the population but not of results (socialism) results depends on the individual yet you need things like free education, free healthcare well not free but paid by the government.

1.- Many venezuelans left the country therefore they buy bitcoin as an exchange to send money here, many people have a business over this, giving people nice conversion rates and taking a %. 
2.- People handle a wide amount of bolivares and since the inflation is massive they rather put it in 0.0001BTC than leave it in the bank, if you have the knowledge of bitcoin, if not they buy USD cash. 
3.- Chinese people, they are everywhere and they have massive amounts of money in Bolivares they sell/buy bitcoins and make profit out of it.

Government sells food cheaper because of subsidy, however people line for these food overnight and wait hours and days to buy a KG of rice for 1cent or less, some people buy that at that price then sell it at $1 make a lot of profit.
