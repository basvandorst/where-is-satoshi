Bitcoin cash isnt best in class in anything to be honest. There are still coins out there that are 100 times as fast and 100 times as cheap. 
Look at bitcoin as virtual gold.

Yep,.. no matter how much USDT pairs there are,.. all altcoins still seem to be tied up with BTC.

Same goes for instance for the Netherlands. You can pay a salary with anything. Bitcoin, Euro, Chickens. We don’t care.

You can own a fraction and make a profit :) 
Since you are new be carefull. Make sure you have a safe wallet to store the bitcoins. Dont keep them on an Exchange. The market is unregulated. 
Trust no one :) And dont believe everything you read. 
Don’t spend anything you can’t miss. Yes, 0.1 Bitcoin might be worth 10.000 dollars in time. Who knows! But it could also be worthless. Noone knows for sure. The only thing they know is that their Bitcoin is worth more if you buy more. So stay on your toes :)
Don’t try to day trade or swing trade when you are new to this. If you arnt a professional, You’ll lose. 
Thats it :) Good luck out there!
