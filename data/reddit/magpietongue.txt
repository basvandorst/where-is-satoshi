I don't consider the very slight gains in terms of entropic cost of hashrate to offset the more substantial attack vector that is borne out of providing power to ASIC manufacturers that run shady pools.
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:58:38
I can't tell if you're ignoring my arguments or if you're having trouble parsing them. If you're having trouble parsing them, let me know and I will try to clarify my points.
As I've stated before: more hashrate does not equate to better network security overall. Similarly, maintaining the status quo of decentralisation isn't really a good thing. I'd actually argue that the network is weaker if it is not becoming increasingly decentralised, but that's probably not a hill worth dying on.
The main crux of my argument is that more hash rate is not 'better' (for the system as a whole) if the means of producing more hashrate is becoming increasingly centralised. I don't think it's a coincidence that the world's largest Bitcoin pool is also leading the ASIC arms race. You are now more reliant than ever on Antpool remaining a good actor. If you have only maintained the status quo for decentralisation while giving the most powerful actor additional influence over future hashrate in the network, I truly don't consider the network any more secure than it was previously.
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:27:15


I don't think I was trying to 'win' rather than having a productive debate. I think that remark was an attempt at derailing the discussion though.


Here's a snapshot of my train of thought if it helps clarify where I've supposedly gone wrong.
Fees were low, fees are now high. The network is not stronger than it was previously, as hashrate by percentage has remained reasonably consistent across the major pools. Therefore, the recent addition of high fees has not furthered the protection of the network.
If you could point out my error, that would be great. I don't see how decentralisation not decreasing changes my point.

Is that $115 profit after accounting for your energy bill? Do you understand where that energy goes?
That energy becomes heat energy. To gain $115 in profit, you will be generating a lot of heat. Each miner is like running a bar heater. Keeping your miners (and the space they operate in) cool will be difficult, loud and expensive. If a miner gets too hot, you can destroy it. If you don't know what you are doing, you can destroy it. If you are just unlucky, you can destroy it. All of those negatively impact your ability to meet return on investment.
That $115 will be considered income, and make your taxes more difficult. 
That $115 per month will also decrease over time. In some ways the return will diminish linearly as new hashrate adds to the system. It can also decrease non-linearly, if a new ASIC technology is suddenly deployed. This impacts your potential for reaching ROI.
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:11:50


That's an incredibly trivial model of PoW. Higher hashrate doesn't equate to higher security unless that hashrate is adequately decentralised. Since the network is no more decentralised than it was before the fee market exploded, I think we're getting a bad deal. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:04:17


If you want people to speak to you like you're an adult, maybe you should earn it. Reflect on your own comments.
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:39:18


I again think that's a somewhat trivial model of the network.


Maybe very slightly at an entropic level, but the cost of hash/sec is decreasing due to the mass production of ASIC miners. I don't think that should be ignored.
Beyond that, I'm far less concerned about a bad actor suddenly producing enough hashes to conduct a 51% attack on the network. I am more concerned that existing actors will exploit their control over ASICs to gain dominance.
The reality is that SHA256 ASICs are now a very serious attack vector. If the network has not further decentralised, and has increased in hashrate, it has handed more authority to the very centralised and somewhat shady industry of ASIC manufacturers.
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:04:58
I don't think this is even a debate at this point. You've completely ignored the vast majority of my points.


Honestly when you said "higher hashrate = higher security" you kind of did imply that.
In any case, I've explained my position on why I believe that the network is no more secure than it was previously. If you disagree, you disagree. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 12:37:32
When the fees are super high and the transaction throughput is bottlenecked, it certainly doesn't behave like a very good payment system. Bitcoin needs scaling solutions.

It would be incredibly difficult to brute force the rest of the words. It's possible, but you're pretty safe for the foreseeable future. 
If you plan to do this, I recommend doing three locations instead, because you're effectively doubling the risk of losing all your coins to an environmental disaster if you use your current strategy.
Divide your recovery words into three parts.
A, B, C.
Have one page that contains the set for A and B
Have one page that contains the set for B and C
Have one page that contains the set for A and C
This means that with any two pages you can regain access to your private key. If one page is destroyed, you don't lose all your coins.
@_date: 2017-12-25 08:53:54
Even I do this.
Split the key into A, B, C.
Keep A and B together.
Keep B and C together.
Keep C and B together.
Any combination of two will give you access to the full private key.

Moving your Bitcoin across the network will always attract a fee. You might lose maybe $1.00-0.50 worth of coin if you configure your transaction right.

A lot of people don't seem to understand why you'd do this. It's not about being rational; it's about being different. If this guy is genuinely doing what he's saying in this highly unsubstantiated claim, he's going to be in a somewhat unique situation.
Go look at documentaries like Alone in the Wilderness. The decision to live in the Alaskan wilderness alone isn't particularly rational either - but it made the documentarian's life unique, and meaningful in a somewhat special way. Being paid in BTC rather than USD is a pretty small risk to take for one hell of a story.

With limit orders you don't ever need to pay attention to the charts in order to trade. Set alerts for order fills and have a stop loss set up to mitigate loss from crashes. 
It's actually a pretty smart to learn with just $5. It's like weight training in reverse, because your money gains market resistance as you put more skin in the game. If you learn to trade with $5, then scale to $500, you generally get a good idea of whether or not trading is right for you. After that you can put more substantial amounts of money into trades.

In fairness, no one would have listened to that advice. You can't be convinced to buy something just by having someone tell you "you should buy this".  You need to do your own research and determine that it might be something with potential. You need to come to the conclusion that an investment is worthwhile on your own.
If you had have said "What do you think of this Bitcoin thing?" and started a conversation by sending them a link to a video about Bitcoin, there's a much higher chance that he would have considered the technology and its applications.

In fairness Satoshi *did* also intend for it to be a system analogous to cash. Bitcoin *should* be able to buy coffee. It used to be able to, and now that it can't it makes sense that people are looking for coins that can.
If we're going to take Satoshi's words as doctrine, he also supported the idea that as the network grows, we should grow the blocksize. Satoshi was a smart guy, but the system he made was meant to be about decentralisation and consensus. It's really strange to look to Satoshi as a point of authority when he designed the system so that it doesn't need an authority.

The signs of the MtGox crash were plastered on the walls. Anyone smart knew something was about to collapse, because the system was too centralised around MtGox. The exchange was being DDOSed every single day, and while it was being DDOSed everyone panic sold. The panic sells triggered stop loss orders, and the market was being gamed that way pretty easily. The price would recover once the DDOS stopped.
The "big" crash was pretty much the same thing, except this time people had also learnt that during the crashes you could sell your coins and buy coins cheaply at the base of the manipulation. I tripled my coin pile that way. All the traders were trying to play "catch the knife". 
When the big crash finally happened, it was pretty much over in hours. It was the most violent market reaction I had ever personally witnessed. 
Edit: Also the wild sense of fear that overcame people during the crash was palpable. I was scared watching the red candles grow even after I had sold. If I remember correctly there was a sticky to a suicide hotline on this sub that week. I also remember that a lot of people gloated in the aftermath, saying "of course Bitcoin was never going to work - anyone who lost their money deserves it. bitcoin is a stupidity tax".
I should mention that the general vibe of the Bitcoin community is very different to the frenzy in the lead up to the last big crash. There's a lot of hope here, but we haven't seen a fraction of the "paradigm shift" posts associated with the last big bubble.

SegWit is short for 'Segregated Witness'. Every time a transaction happens on the block chain, it has 'witness' data built into the transaction data that goes into the block. SegWit found a way to segregate that data and make it a quarter of the size. If you are sending to and from a SegWit enabled address, your transactions are cheaper because you need to pay for less space on the blockchain (because the witness part of the transaction is small now).

Arbitrage is not instant or free. The cost to move your coins, the cost to sell the coins, the cost of the tax event from selling your coins, the cost to convert to USD + wire transfer to your account, the time it takes to transfer is time that you could be realising profit on your crypto, the time it takes for your bank to authorise the deposited funds, the lag of time between the bank and when you realise it's banked, the time cost to send your funds to gdax, the cost of the buy order.

Absolutely not. There are plenty of other regulations to blame if you want to point at the Internet being centralised in the hands of ISPs.

A couple of things to consider.
Each time an on-chain transaction is made, the fees from that transaction go to whoever mines the block. The fee bounty has already been higher than the block reward.
Also, the huge amount of computing power thrown at Bitcoin is not processing transactions; it's thermodynamically securing Bitcoin from a hostile takeover. One shitty computer with an Internet connection and a few TB of HDD space is all the network 'needs' to process transactions. Three laptops would technically be sufficient to protect the entire network, and ensure that transactions can be processed safely and without risk of a 51% attack.

Bitcoin's growth is currently unprecedented in Western financial history. The only thing comparable is the myth of the tulip bubble. We're increasingly speeding beyond that point. This has gone beyond "fear of missing out" and has become a paradigm shift.
What you call the catalyst of an inevitable correction, I view as the catalyst of a new era.

A huge part of the Bitcoin protocol relies on a distributed network. Part of networking is the associated network effect. The reason that many people have Facebook is because their friends encourraged them to get Facebook. That doesn't make Facebook a Ponzi scheme - it makes Facebook part of a network.
Your belief that people are trying to increase adoption so that they can cash out may be true for some people, but I don't think that's true of the vast majority of the community. There is a strong rhetoric around 'hodling' here, and visionaries who discuss the long term implications of Bitcion are treated as celebrities.
You are bringing your own personal biases to the conversation. If you don't want to invest in Bitcoin - don't. If you think we act like a cult - yeah, probably. Most niche collections of people seem very bizarre when observed from outsiders.

Looking past the obvious issues of linear data projections, the point of Bitcoin 'wasting' electricity is in fact a core principle of the design. The reason dirt has no value in small quantities is because there is no cost required to obtain it. The reason dirt has value in large quantities is because there is effort required to obtain it. There is a proof of work.
As long as there is speculation in the markets, there is going to be speculation in the mining industry. When Bitcoin reaches approximate price discovery, the acceleration of mining operations should diminish. 
Beyond that, Bitcoin mining only occurs where the cost per kWh is lower than the expected income per kWh. What we're actually seeing is that huge percentages of all the Bitcoin mining in the world happens next to hydro electricity plants in China. Bitcoin is creating a demand for clean energy that will see coal, gas, and nuclear replaced faster than they would be without that demand.

This is a pretty fucking pivotal point that you're hand waving over. This would add massive amounts of centralisation and reliance on human intervention. The whole process of Bitcoin is currently mathematically trustable, and you're adding human intermediaries. 


This is old world thinking. There is no reason for a person to be named in a financial transaction. A system should not care who money belongs to.

In 2009 the only trades were from cypherpunks testing out the technology. They mined it and thought it was a novel form of exchange. Gambling was pretty much the first form of trade, and since it was so worthless it was just seen like playing games with your tech buddies for monopoly money. 
In 2010 some of the earliest exchanges go live. Magic the Gathering Online exchange (mtgox.com) was one of the first movers. People could now speculate that USD value of Bitcoin. Massive price fluctuations occurred as monied libertarians entered the space.  
In 2011, The Silk Road is born. Criminals see Bitcoin and it's potential for exchange and seek to exploit it. They use Bitcoin as a medium for the purchase of drugs.
In 2012, gambling started becoming big. Satoshi Dice made provably fair gambling with the blockchain a reality. Criminal enterprise thrives as the Silk Road gains adoption.
In 2013, a huge speculative bubble appears, driving users from outside the criminal world into the Bitcoin ecosystem. Merchant support increased rapidly, with many merchants eager to cut down their transaction fee overhead. MtGox dies, and the bubble bursts.
2014-2016 was mostly just a phase of low level adoption. A lot of alt coins started establishing in this time period. Ethereum had its ICO in 2014.

If Bitcoin hits $100k, suddenly the equivalent of $15 becomes 0.150mBTC. If it hits $1m suddenly we're talking about 0.015mBTC.
Comparatively, 150k Sat just becomes 15k Sat at $100k, and $1.5k Sat at $1m. It seems so much more fluid to me.

This is backwards. A behaviour has to have a cost in order for the outcome of the behaviour to have value.
Labour has a time cost, which is why labour is valuable.
Mining precious metals has a resource cost, which is why precious metals are valuable.
The cost of acquiring a few grains of dirt is practically zero, which is why dirt in low volumes is worthless.
The cost of breathing air is practically zero, which is why air is free.
Mining Bitcoin has a cost as well, generally linked very closely to the kWh cost of electricity.

Yes, without net neutrality ISPs would be able to deny service to parts of the Internet at their discretion. It's definitely an attack vector against Bitcoin that needs to be considered. In a perfect world if one ISP blocked Bitcoin, and another didn't, you'd just move to the other ISP and the free market would make the ISP that blocked Bitcoin fade into non-existence. 
However, government corruption ensures that telcos have Internet monopolies at the moment. For many people, they don't have an alternative ISP, and even if they did have an alternative, there's nothing to suggest that both ISPs wouldn't conspire together.

There's a very good reason that a huge amount of miners live near hydro dams in China. Renewable energy is cheap energy, and when your power bill is in the $100k+ region per month, you want to minimize your kWh cost as much as possible. 
Solar is already the cheapest kWh form of electricity that exists, but there are few solar plants operating with the latest technology. Bitcoin fuels demand, and will help speed along innovation. The world has plenty of deserts, and I can easily see a future with sprawling underground Bitcoin mines powered by an overhead grid of solar. We might see some Bitcoin mines near volcanoes for geothermic power too, which is gonna be pretty cool.

A hedge is just a way to protect yourself from financial loss. If I make one big order now while we're running along the all time high, and Bitcoin's price dips back a few hundred dollars, I will have made a loss.

The thing you're likely missing is that different exchanges have different fee structures. When an exchange's fees are higher than normal, it generally means that there are higher costs associated with that exchange.

I don't think you've fully thought this through. You're probably right that it will damage the economy, but deflationary currency will work because just fine.
Also FWIW Bitcoin's deflationary properties are almost a bit of a misnomer. Bitcoin actually inflates between block halvings, and then has a single deflationary event. We're already seeing blocks that have more BTC in fees than the block reward. As the block reward halves, the degree of deflation gets smaller and smaller too. Within the next two-three block halvings, the amount of deflation (and inflation) is going to reduce to a very negligible amount.
The most important thing is that Bitcoin will inflate far less than fiat currencies currently do.

I feel like you keep changing the bar.
If the government introduces a blockchain/cryptocurrency solution as you suggested, it would almost by necessity need to be centralised, and that would be incredibly prone to attack. The reason banks are generally not hacked is because they operate over closed Intranets. A cryptocurrency solution would need merchants to have access, so either expose the intranet or move to the Internet. 
If they move to the Internet, they get hacked eventually. They'd also likely get DDOSed every single day. Government simply cannot meaningfully implement a blockchain-like solution. If their solution is not decentralised, every script kiddie in the world will point their botnets at it.

It might be that way for some people, but I genuinely believe that a lot of people think that Bitcoin has massive disruptive potential, and is going to change the world. One of the reasons that I hold rather than spend my coins is that it increases the price which increases the appeal which increases the network effect which increases the probability of Bitcoin disrupting the status quo.
Greater things are at play than getting rich quick. In a Ponzi scheme, people take their profits and run. That hasn't really happened in Bitcoin.

Increaing the block size to 8MB would make a few really big blocks with low fees, and then we'd go back to normal for a while. With adoption, those blocks would fill up more and more. Eventually you'd be left with your dick in your hand, and you'd need to scale again.
The reality is that scaling the blockchain by increasing the block size is not that effective. I'll demonstrate with some napkin math.
VisaNet handles 150M transactions per day. Let's translate that to 10 minutes, so we can compare to blocks... There are 1440 minutes in a day - 144 minutes per 'block'. 150M/144 = 1041666. So Visa averages over a million transactions every 10 minutes.
Average transactions for Bitcoin are 450 bytes. To scale to VisaNet levels, that's 468,749,700 bytes per 10 minutes. That's 468MB blocks. 
Who's going to download 468MB blocks every 10 minutes? I currently run a full node, and I wouldn't dream of doing that. Not only is that 24TB per year, I probably couldn't do it if I wanted to because I'm using ADSL2+ Internet. Most people running full nodes wouldn't be prepared to provision an extra 67GB of blocks per day in hdd space and bandwidth. That would centralise the network to an unacceptable level.
Increasing the block size simply does not scale over time. We need to look at other solutions.

Yes, but it's also super important to remember that the process of mining could be safely done by three very low end computers.

The quote itself: Satoshi Nakamoto is a cypherpunk who believes that existing financial systems have failed, and need to be replaced. He encoded that message in the first block in the blockchain. It was taken as call to arms to supplant the world's financial systems. In the early days the only people using Bitcoin were anarchists, cypherpunks and libertarians.

Why are the big ISPs (that essentially have a monopoly) lobbying to destroy net neutrality if they would lose market share? 


I'm ridiculously anti-government - just look through my post history. Your idea is just completely unrealistic because there are other regulations in place that gatekeep for the telcos. Those regulations act as barriers to entry to prevent new entrepreneurs from competing with existing ISPs offer. Getting rid of net neutrality before getting rid of the telco monopolies would absolutely not decrease the centralisation of the Internet. It would entrench the power of the existing monopolies and allow them unprecedented control to manipulate the flow of information however they so choose.

Moving your funds to another wallet does not mean that you are forced to sell at that wallet's assumed exchange rate.
If you have 1 BTC and you transfer that 1 BTC to another wallet, sans fees you will have most of your BTC (sans maybe 0.0005 to cover withdrawal fees). If you later decide to sell your 1 BTC, you would likely want to move it back to the exchange that you purchased on.
There are a lot of factors that differentiate the price of Bitcoin between exchanges. The only thing that matters is how much Bitcoin you have.

There is going to be a correction at some point. There will be dozens of obituaries for Bitcoin, and everyone will say "GG, Bitcoin couldn't' survive wall street". A month or two later, most will have forgotten Bitcoin and assumed it to have  been a failed experiment. Interest will wane, but a core group of dedicated people who see long term potential will remain. 
It's useful to remember that during the last crash, there was a suicide hotline stickied on the front page of this subreddit. The price had tested $150~ or thereabouts from $1100. Nowadays people would love to have bought in at $5k.

Bitcoin is still an unregulated experiment. It has a lot of issues to resolve before it can be widely adopted by a corporation like Google. Being realistic, Bitcoin's user experience is still very sketchy; storing private keys has not got an elegant solution that lets you spend and secure your finances; there are serious limitations around the number of tx per second compared to other payment protocols. Also, if I'm being perfectly honest I imagine large corporations are going to be more interested in use cases like dApps than Bitcoin's ledger + store of value. Unless you expect Google to just HODL, there's no real reason why they should use Bitcoin rather than Visa/MasterCard/Paypal. The cost/benefit just isn't there.

From an ideological standpoint, ETH is better than BTC. I truly believe that. As a software developer, the potential of ETH is radical. If you check in on ETH's price in two years time, you'll make a profit against USD for sure; possibly not against BTC though.
If you're planning to play at trading and profit, the smart move is to move with the public. No one knows the future, but it's easy to get a gauge of the present. At the moment everyone is buying Bitcoin, and people who believe in alts are switching to Bitcoin to ride the wave. When Bitcoin plateaus, people will start divesting back into alts; or at least I know that I will be. The potential for growth is higher than Bitcoin.

IMO Ver's BTC moving is a double-bluff market manipulation. He's smart enough not to dump all of his Bitcoin for Bitcoin Cash at once, and he's also smart enough not to put all of his coins on an exchange - even if he's buddies with them. He understands that there are eyes on his wallet - and if no one had noticed, he would have pointed it out himself. 
The most basic reason to move all your coins onto an exchange is to sell. He wants people to jump ship from BTC and get ready to 'ride the pump' of BCH. He's increasing the value BCH without executing a single sell order. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 10:04:27
Not so sure that I agree with the people feeling rich side of things. What I do think is useful is the psychological and programmatic value of integers over decimals. 
When dealing with BTC programmatically, you already treat 1BTC as 100,000,000 Sats. Companies don't want to lose or double spend their precious Satoshis on their off-chain financial tracking systems due to rounding errors.
Pricing in Satoshis is absolutely the next step. Pricing in mBTC or bits just makes the situation even more confusing than it already is.

1) Bitcoin's value is entirely speculative. 
2) Regulation around Bitcoin unclear. In some cases where it is clear, the capital gains on the currency is double and triple taxed as Bitcoin is regulated as multiple types of asset.
3) Bitcoin does not generate any revenue.
4) As a technology, you're not even putting money behind a particular organisation. You are at the mercy of a network that contains malicious actors.
5) If your Bitcoin is lost or stolen there is no way to recover it. Normal markets have regulations that help to protect people from loss and theft. 
6) The vast majority of people are not ready to be their own bank, and have their money sitting on exchanges or on unsecured PCs that are connected to the Internet. $300M worth of Ethereum was lost forever last week because of a single programmer. Around 7% of all Bitcoins in existence were stolen when MtGox was hacked.

The only way that people seem to be able to manipulate the market is to cause the price to rise, since there is a strong culture around 'holding' your coins and treating it as a long term savings account/investment.

Back in 2012. The community was pretty trustworthy back then. Most of everyone who used Bitcoin were just people who wanted to buy weed on Silk Road. Even if they were addicted to harder stuff, I'd probably put more trust in a drug dealer than some of the wall street money entering Bitcoin now.

This is just my opinion, and my opinion is as worthless as everyone else's here.
The world has 33 million millionaires, and a large segment of that millionaire class have their money in ETFs. The issue is that managed funds have management fees. People with money don't like paying fees.
Investing in Bitcoin doesn't have fund management fees. I believe that a bunch of people who are reasonably wealthy are withdrawing from their ETFs or hedging with Bitcoin. As an added bonus, Bitcoin is unseizable and that's something that matters a lot to people with sizable chunks of capital. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 03:05:28
Yeah, I get that 210,000 is a somewhat arbitrary number. Satoshi seems to have been a big fan of multiples of '21'. 
What I don't get though, is why we don't move toward a more obviously deflationary system than the one that exists. I don't think there would really be any programmatic issues with division of float points (IIRC BTC are actually int64s made up of 100M Satoshis), and I don't think miners would really care that much about whether or not their block got rounded down by 1 Satoshi every so often. 
In my mind a linear reward falloff would benefit both users and miners because they wouldn't need to speculate as much as they currently do during halving events.

Bitcoin Cash is attempting to solve scaling in a way that keeps all transactions on the blockchain, rather than relying on third party intermediaries like LN. At it's simplest, they perceive scaling the blockchain as better for the Bitcoin environment than scaling via layer 2 solutions.
My money moves with consensus, though I think that the Bitcoin Cash camp has some valid criticisms of the reliance of layer 2. In retrospect, the SegWit hard fork was probably done earlier than it should have been. If hard forks happen again in future, more efforts should be made to maximise consensus rather than just trying to achieve the necessary majority. 
With that said, Bitcoin Cash's camp definitely has *a huge amount* of astroturf. Their tactics have been so underhanded that there's no room for further debate anymore.

All exchanges have a limited number of coins on them. It's a matter of what people have deposited. African exchanges have fewer total coins than most other exchanges. When you have different volumes, and reasons for why people might be adverse to arbitrage exist, you get price differences.
No one is trading physical coins. There are just always regional price differences based on physical proximity and legislative borders. For example, Australian exchanges have Bitcoin valued higher than US exchanges, even after accounting for the difference in dollar value. There's no real risk associated with the exchange. Arbitrage to Australia is just difficult because of taxation law around capital gains. Difficult arbitrage + with low volume = higher price.
The reason that few people are jumping on the arbitrage bandwagon in Zimbabwe's situation is because they don't trust putting my money on an African exchange. How do I know that they actually have all the coins that they're saying they have? How do I know that they wont shut up shop after I deposit my coins? What are their withdrawal times? What currency can you reasonably expect to withdraw? How long will it take me to fund the exchange? All these factors and many more play a role in whether or not arbitrage can be done successfully. I'm sure there are people with higher risk tolerance than mine who are taking advantage of the arbitrage and will eventually stabilise the market.
As an aside the reason you generally can't arbitrage with crypto in panic situations is because the other crypto is also inflated as well. Your option is cash, which has a withdrawal time and limits your ability to buy/sell repeatedly for large profits.

"What you can afford to lose" doesn't mean anything to someone with few assets and no risk free hope of acquiring meaningful assets.
If you're able to afford rent, utilities and other life expenses - *any* money you have on top of that is potentially "what you can afford to lose". When you have no assets that require liquidity, your ability to take 'irrational' investments increases.

You cannot possibly sell 30,000 coins at the current market price all in one go, unless there is hypothetically some idiot who wants to buy all 30,000 coins at that price. Facilitating a transaction of this scale on an exchange would also be pretty stupid, because the exchange would take a non-trivial amount of money.

For starters, a penny under your couch doesn't earn interest. Interest isn't some magical power that fiat currency has. The only way cash earns interest is if you loan it to someone. You can also loan your Bitcoins to earn interest if you want to.
Beyond that, the interest that cash earns in a savings account is at constant odds with the inflation rate. Unless you shop around for banks, and agree to have limited access to your money, you'll lose buying power in the long term.

The price of Bitcoin is paired quite heavily with the KwH price of each T/Hash added to the network, and it's not so much that you would be entitled to profits from remittances, so much as that there would be sufficient demand to justify the current prices.

I don't see the US government as a risk to Bitcoin. Even if they close exchanges, they can't shut it down. China is still trading as much Bitcoin as ever, even with the exchanges being outlawed.

I feel like you're missing context. Whether or not saving is a habit is beyond the point. In the context of a corrupt system that punishes saving, savings have hit an all time low. The high rates of inflation caused by our debt-driven financial system means that people prefer debt to savings. If you have good saving habits - great. But if you're saving a currency that is inflationary, you're being punished for saving. Since Bitcoin is deflationary, it promotes a different style of thinking that threatens the dominant philosophy of the banking sector.

I wouldn't be so sure that Bitcoin won't be the be-all, end-all. Other cryptos will develop technology, and Bitcoin will amalgamate that technology into itself. Bitcoin is closer than ever before to anonymous transactions (mirroring the function of zcoin), smart contracts (mirroring the function of ethereum), segwit transactions (activated in litecoin before bitcoin), and other layer2/layer3 technology. When LN activates, I doubt there will be any room for the huge swathes of alt coins that promise faster transactions with lower fees. 
Alt coins are useful testbeds, and I do own some because of their use cases, but I do think that Bitcoin is going to continue to develop until it's as close to feature complete as money can be.

I'm really struggling to find your rationale. Saving isn't a *rational* choice. If a rational person were given the option of setting fire to $1 or being given $0.50, they would chose the option that gives them money over the option that costs them money. Saving 0.5% when there is 2% inflation does not result in *any* benefit for the saver. It costs them money. The choice to save is not rational. Non rational choices should not be considered as realistic choices. If we're going to discuss other irrational things that people could do, but say that they totally count as realistic options, then I guess people could also have the choice to deposit all of their money into an actual tire fire. 


Fortunately there's this awesome new currency called Bitcoin that's a deflationary currency. Instead of your $1 losing 2.2% of its value every year, its value should *increase* as a function of scarcity.

Anyone confused by how we hit 11k so quickly after 10k, the math behind it is pretty simple. You just need to think in percentage gains rather than flat dollar values.


Essentially, it took 10% growth to grow by $1000 from $10000 to $11000.


When we were going from $9000 to $10000, we needed growth of 11.1%. Given consistent demand, it takes a little longer to grow by 11.1% than it does to grow by 10%. It's still amazing that Bitcoin saw a temporary 10% increase in a single day, but this is a new market and new markets are subject to volatility.
For fun, here's the diminishing percentage gains needed to hit the next few $1000 ATH goals.

Either way, UNICEF figures show 130 million births per year, and the planet's population is around 7.4 billion.

Ver has closer to 200k coins than 25k coins, those are just the ones 'confirmed' to be on an exchange. 
A huge sell also drops the market cap far more than a 1:1 ratio. Depending on the size of the sell, it could drop the market cap by a very hefty percentage. For any newbies that stumble on this post, it's very important to understand that a market cap of 115 billion doesn't mean that there is 115 billion dollars in the Bitcoin ecosystem. That's the total maximum if every coin in existence  sold at the current price, which is a situation that would never occur.

Semi-close. They got hacked, and tried to cover it up by trading while insolvent. Everyone who lost their money on mtgox kind of deserved it for placing faith in Mark Karpeles.

One or both of us is terrible at communicating. 
I wouldn't expect any merchants to accept IOUs. I would expect end users of Bitcoin to make a deposit of real Bitcoins in exchange for IOUs which could then be cashed out as real BTC on 'withdrawal'. This is exactly how most Bitcoin exchanges work. Unless all customers wanted to withdraw their Bitcoin at the exact same time, the entity could theoretically reinvest its customers Bitcoin, only keeping a fraction of funds in reserve to cover withdrawals.

The price is generally listed in the local currency. It's not a complex transaction. Further, the value of local currencies is also variable. Ask our friends in Venezuela whether they would rather pay with their federal currency or Bitcoin for stability at the moment. Also if someone pays for a coffee with a credit card, there is a chance that the transaction will be charge backed. It's unlikely, but definitely possible - just like the minute risk that a zero confirmation transaction will go through.

There is simply no way that fiat isn't about to implode. If you thought moving away from the gold standard was bad, and fractional reserve lending is bad, and the Japanese equivalent of the FED owning almost 75% of all Japanese ETFs was bad, and that zero interest on excess reserves was bad, I got news for you.

Greece, and a bunch of others in the fallout from 2008. The poor bastards peaked at a 27% unemployment rate. You also missed Zimbabwe printing currency with expiration dates, which I find especially shocking.
The upcoming collapses will likely have something to do with Japan's equivalent of the FED printing money to buy ETFs - so many that they own roughly three quarters of all Japanese ETFs.
Either that, or it will have something to do with negative interest on excess reserves - something currently happening that economists didn't consider possible.

If I understand you right, I think it would be really risky to dump BTC to short a BCH position. A huge percentage of BCH coins have never moved since the start of the fork.

Not really analogous at all. You seem to have confused inflation with interest.
The reality is that interest on cash only exists because there are institutions who borrow and loan cash. As much as it would make the cypherpunks roll in their grave, there's nothing to stop people from borrowing Bitcoins and loaning Bitcoins at different rates of interest. Hell, there's really not even anything stopping them from using fractional reserve lending.

His net worth is estimated to be around $0.5B-2B. BCH's market cap is $23B. BTC's market cap is $107B. He needs to generate *a lot* of capital if he wants to close that gap.
At best he can put a month or two's worth of buy pressure on BCH to make it more profitable for miners, but that subsidisation of mining would likely cost him far more than he'd gain. Plus the Bitcoin network would adjust its difficulty and more-or-less recover. The network's hashrate isn't that important.

The difference is the financial stake at play. A lot of the big Bitcoin companies do currently have people involved with Core on staff. From that, a problem arises: some feel that Bitcoin Core devs are representing the commercial interests of the people paying their salary, rather than the best interests of the Bitcoin ecosystem.

Between the Great China Firewall, Russia's flip flopping, and a disruption to net neutrality in the US, all three of the major superpowers would pose threat vectors to Bitcoin's network.

Just as a word of caution: 
0.062 BTC is what someone in the Czech Republic makes per month. That makes your Bitcoin wallet equivalent to 16 months worth of work for someone in the Czech Republic. 
You just broadcasted to the Internet that you have what many people consider 'a huge amount of money' from your main Reddit account that has a verified email, and in the same breath told the Internet that you're securing your funds on desktop.
Bitcoin is unhackable - but you are. If the value of Bitcoin raises, which I'm sure you hope it will, the target on your back grows with it.

He has 200,000 BTC and an equal amount of BCH so it's more like billions of dollars.
The reality is that he is not trying to 'harm' Bitcoin. He has a philosophy that aligns more closely with Satoshi's original vision of Bitcoin, and he's zealous about his philosophy. However, Bitcoin isn't just some cypherpunk experiment anymore, and frankly Satoshi's vision no longer matters. The community owns and is invested in Bitcoin now, and solutions that Satoshi had not thought of are necessary to move Bitcoin from something that has utility to cypherpunks, anarchists, and fringe libertarians, into something that can actually realise its potential.

Hopefully at a near point in the future, faster transactions should become an irrelevant factor. With the off-chain and cross-chain solutions promised by Lightning Network (and other similar projects), I don't think speed/fees are going to be a pain point for Bitcoin. There's not much room for alts to to improve on transactions once they're measured in milliseconds and cost fractions of a cent.
Just my opinion, but now that we're starting to see big developers throwing money behind proprietary Bitcoin tech, the barrier to entry for other crypto is going to lock a lot of competition out of the market.

Your friend is either a conspiracy theorist, or prone to being one.
Bitcoin has always been about *decentralised currency*. 
Do the math on how large blocks need to be in order to scale up to 1 billion transactions per day. Then calculate how large the block chain needs to be (as a hint, the answer should make you say "holy crap that's huge" and "yeah, that's not going to work"). Once you've done that, ask yourself what the consequences of that block size and blockchain size does to decentralisation. 
Many of the contributors to Bitcoin Core are doing research and development towards scaling solutions that retain decentralisation while also scaling towards billions of transactions per day. Bigger blocks do neither of those things.

@_date: 2017-11-20 14:27:50
You can currently clear transactions for the equivalent of $0.23 USD, despite Bitcoin being up about 800% from that point in time.
Ask most vendors what they currently pay in transaction fees for fiat transactions - particularly with credit card and eftpos, and you'll quickly realise that $0.23 of fees isn't that odd. In a lot of cases as a flat fee it's a bargain.
There are solutions in the works to make transaction fees even lower (towards non-existent). Not sure why people are still trying to push the idea that Bitcoin fees are high.

When I look at the US, I see a billionaire giving tax benefits to the rich. I see the federal reserve printing more and more dollars. I see the federal reserving using those dollars to prop up the economy, now hoarding 4T worth of assets that will never be saleable because it would collapse the market. I see a country with less economic freedom than at least a dozen other countries. I see negative inflation on excess reserves. I see Flint still without water. I see brewing civil unrest.
It wasn't that long ago that I saw a global financial crisis, caused by delinquency of American mortgages, and complete mismanagement of the financial sector. I saw 10 million American families lose their homes. I saw America fight a meaningless war in Iraq that cost $2T, further destabilising the geopolitical situation in the region. I saw the banks get bailed out. I saw the CEOs and CFOs who acted fraudulently receive bonuses instead of prison time.

There is limited access to local sellers, as not many people are trading Zimbabwean dollars for Bitcoin. People are wanting to secure their funds from seizure, so the demand for Bitcoin (which is relatively unseizable) is skyrocketing. When demand outpaces supply, the price surges. 
Typically you don't see vast price differences across globalised markets. A market mechanism called 'arbitrage' (where you buy from one market and sell to another market for a profit) normally equalises the price across markets. However, in a situation where there is an active coup, no one wants to risk their funds being seized while attempting to profit from arbitrage. 
That's what's driving the massive price differential.

You have a verified reddit email, and you're telling the Internet that you have the means to buy Bitcoin. Back in the days of SilkRoad, I saw people advertising their services as hitmen for $10k. Cyber attacks were virtually free. Given the trade price of Bitcoin at the moment, you're advertising yourself as a target to some nefarious people.

Without addressing if it's practical, I think you may be offering a solution to something that's not a problem. As it is you can store a full node on a sub $100 drive. The amount of space you can buy for $100 gets bigger and bigger each year. Storing the full blockchain should be cheap for the foreseeable future.
In 2018/2019 LN should become available. As a scaling solution, it will take huge swathes of transactions off the blockchain, which should further reduce the overall size of most blocks.
If space requirements go down while availability of space goes up, there really isn't a problem that needs to be solved.

The majority of Bitcoin users *are* doing it wrong. You'd think people would have learned their lesson from MtGox. Instead, people are losing Bitcoin to hackers every day. The cryptographic components of the blockchain have thus far proven to be unhackable, but large scale Bitcoin sites and average Bitcoin end-users are very susceptible to various forms of attack.
If someone doesn't understand what a hard fork is, they very likely do not understand the importance of a physical or brain wallet. Their coins are probably sitting on an exchange, and they likely wouldn't notice the difference between coinbase.com and coinbase.com, or if the address they just copied turned into a different address when they pasted. In any case, broadcasting "I have lots of money and don't understand this technology" is generally a pretty ill advised thing to do.

Roger Ver knows that there are eyes on his wallet, and he's also buddies with the exchange. If he wanted to credit his account with $150M USD worth of BTC, he would have given them a paper wallet IOU - not a publicly viewable transaction across the network.
I trust that Ver is savvy enough to dollar cost average, and wouldn't dump all of his BTC holdings at once. To do so would simply be a terrible financial decision - especially as BTC rides close to its all time high. That means there's no reason to move all of his BTC across the network at once, unless he wants people to notice it. 
What we're seeing is a market manipulation that can only occur in a blockchain where you can see the moves that other actors are making. The first conclusion of Ver's coins moving to an exchange is "Ver is selling his coins". This is what he wants you to think.
The second, and I imagine far more rational conclusion, is that Ver is moving his coins in a public way to make people believe that he is about to sell his coins. Since Ver is an outspoken advocate of BCH, this will have a market effect where day traders sell BTC (to avoid the 'pending dump') and buy BCH (to profit from the 'pending pump').
Ver's not about to dump $150M worth of BTC for BCH because doing so would be one of the least rational decisions that he could possibly make.
Edit: The bit about a paper wallet seems to have some people in a tizzy. The main idea of transferring the funds to a paper wallet would be so that the exchange could safely hold those funds without following their normal funding process. Moving 25k BTC to cold storage sends a really strong market signal.

1) The vast majority of all real world transactions happen off of the blockchain.
2) There is nothing legally different about an on-chain transfer of funds to an off-chain transfer of funds. 
3) Ver knows people at Bitfinex. There's no reason for Bitfinex not to trust a paper wallet from Ver.
If I were moving $150M worth of an asset onto an exchange that my mates owned in preparation to sell it, I would do everything in my power to ensure that other actors couldn't predict my sell. All the same, that's a moot point. The crux of my theory is that those coins moved because he wanted people to see them being moved.

The tulip bubble never actually happened at the scale that people say it did. It's basically an urban legend at this point, like the '300 Spartans' that stood against the Persians. There's a pint of truth for every gallon of fabrication.
Beyond that, Bitcoin has an extreme amount of utility. Approximately 5 billion people don't have access to financial services, and Bitcoin gives them access to a global network for remittance and security from seizure. $560B worth of remittance is done yearly, and Bitcoin makes that cheaper than ever before. If that were Bitcoin's *only* feature, it would deserve its current valuation. The fact is, it has many more and the number of features across the protocol is increasing month on month.

In fairness I kind of understand his point about BCH being closer to the original version of Bitcoin than the current Bitcoin. He did a lot of work to promote the Bitcoin brand, and I understand him feeling like he has some vested interest in the word. 
With that said, SegWit seems to have been a useful upgrade. One of the things that originally drew me to Bitcoin was the notion of decentralised consensus. When consensus doesn't favour you, the correct response isn't to branch off and create your own fork. If he didn't agree with SegWit, he had other options around the scaling debate.

Fiat's value is literally always going down. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 05:42:32
You've got this very wrong. Gold's use in manufacturing and its use as jewelry both relate to its inherent physical properties. It's a very attractive soft metal. As a bonus, it's also quite rare. That's what gives it its intrinsic value.
Gold wasn't/isn't always worn to show off money; it was worn because it looks good. It gained value because lots of people wanted some gold, *because* it looks good. Gold's value doesn't come from its ability to show proof of wealth. It shows proof of wealth because it's valuable, and it's valuable because of its intrinsic properties. 
Bitcoin's intrinsic value is tied to its utility as currency which *is* slowly being eroded. Core devs have said as much. Without a killer app that negates Bitcoin fees in a fair and trustable way, Bitcoin does not have a particularly appealing intrinsic value.

One of the major factors to Bitcoin's rise in price is the same thing that's causing the stock market in the US to be up, and the price of all Japanese ETFs to be up, and the commodities prices in China to be up...
All the countries are just printing more and more money. Inflation is happening on a grand scale. Unprecedented economic activity is occurring.

This suggests to me that you don't make many Bitcoin transactions. Bitfinex would generate the public and private keys. Ver would fund that wallet and would only have access to the public key. 
It is outside the realm of reasonable to believe that someone intent on dumping 25,000 BTC would move those coins in a public way, unless their motivation was to incite fear, uncertainty and doubt. You do not telegraph a 25,000 BTC dump because the market would react before you get the chance to execute your sell.

The vast majority of all real world transactions happen with fiat currencies. People have been trading stuff outside the blockchain forever. 
My broader point which is being oddly contested is that people with a LOT of value of Bitcoins prefer funding brand new wallets, so that they can maintain relative anonymity, rather than funding 'known' wallets. If I were wanting to dump $150M worth of BTC, it wouldn't make a lot of sense to signal that move to the whole Bitcoin community by transferring coins from a well known wallet into another well known wallet that belongs to an exchange. If Ver's coins moved to an unknown wallet I'd be far more convinced that a massive dump was incoming.

IMO he isn't doing this to scam people, he genuinely believes that Bitcoin Cash is a more usable product than Bitcoin. When he and I first started using Bitcoin, it was basically free to run a transaction. He is factually correct that Bitcoin is more expensive to use for transactions than Bitcoin Cash. 
I think he's a little deluded about the narrative of a hostile takeover of Bitcoin, but the simple reality is that Bitcoin is intended to be a *consensus* driven platform, and when consensus cannot be reached, the rational end point is splintering into two groups so that each can independently achieve consensus.

Beyond all of that, the blockchain focuses on agreement between parties, where consensus wins. Voting power is (approximately) established by contribution to the network. It has almost democratic systems of determining who is trusted, and who is not. 
And then there's the fact that Bitcoin's genesis block contains the message: "The Times 3 January 2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks".
The idea that Bitcoin removed politics from money is ridiculous. Bitcoin coupled with Tor is about as cypherpunk as it gets.

I disagree, but even if true I'm okay with premise. If people are incentivised to buy Bitcoin because it will store value better than an inflationary currency like USD, why would anyone want to have pools of fiat? There will always be other people willing to get rid of easily exchangeable (inflationary) currencies, like cash, for highly secure, but less immediately transactable currency, like Bitcoin. As long as cash keeps inflating, and Bitcoin keeps deflating, it seems rational that the price of Bitcoin will continue to rise by *at least* global inflation.

I really don't want to shill for Bitcoin Cash, but some of what you're saying simply doesn't seem to align with reality.
Gavin Anderson, former lead developer of Bitcoin, is one of Bitcoin Cash's developers. That's far from a Joe Shmoe, code tinkerer. We're talking about super early adopters who have written core functionality for the Bitcoin that you are using today.
You can talk about brand appeal all you want, but the reality is that the very concept of branding something stems from a system where someone has ownership of the brand. It is literally a system of signifying property. Bitcoin is no one's property, and in such an ownerless system, I think it's a lot less clear who can claim use of the brand.

Okay fine: Bitcoin forks every single day by design when there are chain length disputes. Can you really say that one chain is "not Bitcoin" while one chain is Bitcoin? If so at any given moment you don't really know whether or not you're using Bitcoin despite transacting in BTC.

As far as MtGox goes, that argument's a little more credulous, but given that he A) apologised, B) had no way of knowing that they were going to get hacked, and C) lost coins from the hack, I find it difficult to conclude that he's a heinous criminal from that.

That's not really a valid analogy.
It's more akin to someone having a public domain dress pattern that a diverse community always makes updates to, and at a certain point in time someone decides they really want all future versions of the dress to have a longer hemline, because they like longer hemlines and the rest of the community doesn't. 
So they start their own fork of the pattern, and host that fork on a different place. Being able to tell which is "the real one" becomes a matter of perspective since the design has never been static and has no authority to determine which is "real".

Oh no, people are questioning the herd mentality of 'hodl'?
Shouting 'hodl' over and over is a pathetic attempt at market manipulation as well.

I like the cut of your jib. Are you Satoshi?

I think you're missing one of the biggest barriers to entry. People simply aren't ready for the responsibility to be their own bank. For most of us here, the thought of being our own bank is what draws us to Bitcoin. But a lot of people have absolutely no understanding of their own finances, and certainly aren't ready to safely transact and store their own money. Shit, a lot of the people here probably have their money on exchanges. I'm not sure how this problem gets solved, but I think that's the absolute biggest hurdle that Bitcoin is facing.

The common M-80 firecracker used on 4th of July uses 3 grams of powder. These firecrackers use 1 gram of powder. 


Ammunition is also actually explosive, and contains the same form of powder. What's more, it's more dangerous because when exploded they cause a lethal projectile to shoot out of them.
Your argument is nonsense.

$1 worth of Bitcoin now will still be $1 worth of Bitcoin when the trade price of 1BTC is $100,000 per coin. Your rationale that people can be priced out of Bitcoin doesn't make sense.
However, I think people saying that "No one will buy an alt coin if Bitcoin fails" is complete bullshit, as some alt coins are trying to address different use cases to Bitcoin.
There are a lot of greedy people around here, who seem to think that Bitcoin's core utility is its price, but that's not even close to touching on the technical innovation and use cases that Bitcoin brings.

Honestly, what's wrong with selling firecrackers on the Internet? This market spawned out of much shadier shit than that. He wasn't selling things to terrorists, he was selling things to people who wanted to hear a loud pop for fun.
Meanwhile Elon Musk literally tried to buy an intercontinental ballistic missile from Russia and is hero worshipped.

I feel like your understanding of how the world works may be a little skewed. $120k USD is a lot of money for someone who only has a bachelor's degree, regardless of experience. Even in Silicon Valley that income bracket would likely put you in the top 5%-10% of income earners.

My less bitter advice: Always let your wife know how many Bitcoins you have, *and* how to access them in case of your untimely death.
As an aside if you have relationships that aren't trusting enough to let your SO know your financial status, you can definitely expect to find yourself divorced.

Why would anyone take heed of financial advice given by Saudi royalty?

If you think those are the only two use cases for Bitcoin, then you definitely need to expand your views. One of Bitcoin's biggest use cases is remittance to relatives who live in a migrant worker's home country. Countries banning Bitcoin (and the associated price instability) negatively affects that use cases.

Being skeptical of "good news" doesn't make you ill informed. The reality is that China's actions and inactions have risen the stakes in what you're calling a 'war'. The only thing that I *trust* to persevere through such a war is blockchain technology. Free markets make the rest pure speculation. 
Instead of telling other people that they're wrongly concerned with trite and rehashed statements like "This is war!" and "Wake up sheeple", maybe you should instead consider that whatever *your* motives and use cases for Bitcoin are, may not be universal.
