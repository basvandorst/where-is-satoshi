Galileo did a great job on this.
It is a well known show in germany that lost a bit of attention in the past years but when they do articles on internet startups, they are always overwhelmed by the traffic coming from Galileo.
Definetly a good article.

Microsoft manages your points, you cant store them offline and when Microsoft is down, your points are too.
Bitcoin is open source, decentralized and its value is all about supply and demand.
Basically Bitcoin is independent money

Travel around the world, have a good time and spread Bitcoin awareness by giving people 0.5 BTC in every corner of the world.
...or just give away free Tacos like Dillon Francis

Found out about Bitcoin last summer, didn't want to 'waste' my time diving into it. Well, shit happens, just found out abot this reddit last week and reading about Bitcoin all day ever since.
Now I'm about to invest some EURs into this in the next few days.
Any advice If I should wait some more for the EUR to stabilize or invest now while it's hot?
Also as a German, would you prefer bitcoin.de or bitcoin-24 for your first coins?
Thankful for any advice, keep spreading the word!

Mt Gox is an exchange and Buttercoin is an exchange engine that is open source, which means that Buttercoin is no competition for MtGox but MtGox could use Buttercoin once it is done

There are no stupid questions.
I wish I had asked questions when I discovered bitcoin.
I was trying to download the blockchain for 8 months not knowing there are clients like MultBit that do not need the blockchain, so I didn't get the opportunity to buy in cheap.
