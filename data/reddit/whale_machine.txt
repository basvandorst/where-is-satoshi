The level of privacy monero offers, means there is no such thing as tainted coins.

That's what you call a whale.  They have lots of money to play with.

Agreed. But also depends on the timeline and scale, 50 years from now it could be having some when the price was below 50k.

You are your own bank with BTC.  Knowing that address are public it's up to you to distribute them among many addresses if that bothers you.  Freedom of choice.  And sure, code could be implemented to hide amounts, that's exactly how Monero handles it.

Summary: There is no regulation yet.  Banks waiting to see where crypto goes before getting into it. ATB tested a $1000 transfer to a bank in Germany over ripple.

Maybe if it was all an elaborate scheme made by the NSA or whoever, the only back door is all the coins 'satoshi' mined.  Wait until it's big enough and a world currency and suddenly you have a lot of weight to throw around.

Maybe hook their brains up to some sort of virtual world to keep them entertained while we do it too.

Used to mine residential with a small GPU farm, made tons of heat with many days needing to keep windows open even in the winter.  Thought of it more as a side effect that the furnace would run less.  Sure it drops one bill but your paying through electricity effectively, a bonus if you would mine regardless.

Sounds like a shit broker.  Just do it yourself.
