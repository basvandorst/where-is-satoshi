And all of that still uses less energy per transaction than Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is useless for the general public. They have no reason to adopt it. It's also useless for criminals, because the cops are much better at tracing bitcoin transactions than during silk road era.
Mass adoption is not going to happen.

I have multiple bank accounts in multiple countries. And I've never had mine frozen, because I'm not a criminal. Tax evasion is a crime. Tax evaders are stealing from law abiding citizens like me. That's why they should sit in prison. Like all the other thieves.
@_date: 2019-11-18 21:42:31
There's some difference, yeah. But the court basically told to Ulbricht - we don't give a fuck that you didn't retain most of the money that you received - we'll bill you for all of it anyway.
And in this case as well - you're not supposed to have that money in the first place. Sharing keys with others is the same as giving that money to them. That's money laundering and you'll get at least 20 years for that.
And if someone steals that money - also doesn't matter. Many people stole and extorted money from Silk Road. Ulbricht was still required to pay that money back to the government.
Basically - if the government can prove that you had accesss to a lot of illegally obtained money at some point in time - you're in deep shit no matter if you have access to that money right now or not.
Ross was billed 180M despite the fact that the feds seized only 1/10 of that money.
It's all here: [
@_date: 2019-11-08 22:47:44
Not sure how often that happens. Even with all that traditional means of transacting money have much lower costs per transaction than bitcoin. That's the ugly truth. Proof-of-waste is not sustainable. Huge amount of energy is wasted for nothing. Huge amount of CO2 is being emitted for nothing.
@_date: 2019-11-22 19:44:23
They can easily extend that to any bank that accepts USD. Which is...well...pretty much all banks in the Western world.
@_date: 2019-11-25 00:54:58
Bitcoin offers absolutely no advantages for those who want to buy legal stuff. Slow transactions, huge fees, no chargebacks. 
All Bitcoin transactions are public, everyone can trace your money without a warrant - using Bitcoin for illegal stuff is not a wise choice nowadays. It's not the early 2010s any more. The cops are now much better at blockchain analysis. Many DNM operators and users are in prison now.
 So we see that Btc sucks for both law abiding people and criminals. It seems that the only thing that I can do with it is to speculate. Buy low and hope that the price will rise.
@_date: 2019-11-18 11:13:56
There's a precedent already. Ross Ulbricht was held liable for every single bitcoin that was laundered using his Silk Road tumbler and got 20 years for that.
@_date: 2019-11-08 19:09:08
No they should not. People should pay taxes. Those who evade taxes should go to prison. Go and make your own country without taxes, but don't be a freeloader in mine.

The security cost would be hideous, yeah. This is why it's not done without a good reason. Other costs - nope - 20 tons aren't that much. Most trucks can handle that.
@_date: 2019-11-22 19:36:34
It can't be mitigated, because bitcoin has no monetary policy. It has a dumb algorithm, that prints new 12.5 BTC every 10 minutes no matter what. 
Central banks regulate money supply to prevent market manipulation. Too bad that the BTC doesn't have one.
@_date: 2019-11-24 14:39:18

A bank that can't do anything with the USD is worthless. So the Americans can simply say - you can either use the USD or crypto - choose wisely. What do you think the bank will choose? It's trivial for them to block transactions to exchanges or to prevent exchanges from creating bank accounts. No one can prevent you from spending crypto. But exchanges can be controlled pretty easily.
@_date: 2019-11-08 19:07:47
Higher energy consumption also doesn't make transaction processing any faster. Proof-of-waste is a fucking retarded idea.
@_date: 2019-11-09 21:28:46
This makes Bitcoin look very very bad. Because while the global banking system consumes more electricity - it also processes way more transactions than Bitcoin and also offers a lot of other services like loans, fraud protection, personal safes, etc that Bitcoin doesn't. 7 transactions per second is a ridiculously low number.
@_date: 2019-11-24 14:30:01
The only real economy behind bitcoin is child porn and drugs. If DNMs phase out bitcoin, because it has no privacy then why would btc keep its value?
@_date: 2019-11-08 23:49:41
In many cases that gold isn't physically moved at all. Bank of England, the Federal Reserve and other central banks hold a lot of gold that isn't theirs. So if one country decides to buy or sell their gold to another - the gold stays in the same vault and only the ownership papers change.
@_date: 2019-11-25 11:14:53
All those things might become true in the future. But by buying bitcoin you're speculating that the original bitcoin blockchain will be used for all that. And not any of the forks or other altcoins. You must also assume that the 21M limit doesn't get removed. Or that it is not modified to peg it to USD or EUR in order to stop its wild price swings. Lots of assumptions to make.
@_date: 2019-11-25 14:25:49
With so many unknown variables it's more like gambling tbh. And if they decide to convert the BTC into a stablecoin then that alone will shatter all those dreams about one bitcoin being worth millions - even if bitcoin indeed becomes widely used.

@_date: 2019-11-25 23:58:29
Just a few decades actually. In case of currencies like USD or EUR.
You're not supposed to hoard money and stuff it in a mattress. You're supposed to spend and invest it.  Inflation doesn't affect me at all. If you either spend all your salary or invest it somewhere then inflation has no effect on you. 
If you confuse currency with investment - that's your problem. It's like bringing gold coins to a grocery store and wondering why they don't want to accept them as payment.
@_date: 2019-11-24 14:31:09
Doesn't matter. They can figure out other wallets and addresses too.
@_date: 2019-11-09 18:45:12
Yup, but that doesn't happen very often and they usually move a huge amount of gold at once. That Wikipedia article mentions amounts in excess of 100 tons. Most gold market transactions are way smaller than that.

This guy took a plea deal and gave his illegal money to the feds.
Ross, on the other hand, said that he dindu nuffin, pleaded not guilty and started telling bullshit stories to the court. It was a hacker! It was Karpeles! Bitcoin is not money! I earned this by buying low and selling high!
It was not a smart thing to do. This is why they threw the book at him.
OP was smarter than Ross. Otherwise he'd still be in prison.

Depends on the country. There's no capital punishment or life without parole in EU countries. So here he would face the parole board sooner or later. (They could still say "no") But those attempted murders would still get him some serious jailtime. (In my country it's at least 15 years or life - an attempted murder is treated the same as a successful murder.) And 15 years to life in a post-soviet prison would really suck. Sucks to be him - should have done that crap in some other country.

Multiple forks of Bitcoin exist already.
@_date: 2019-10-29 17:08:39
What makes you think that most miners hold bitcoins and don't resell them immediately?
@_date: 2019-10-27 07:45:08
Yeah, Ross Ulbricht found that out the hard way. They seized both him and his coins.
@_date: 2019-10-27 07:35:44
Miners will change the algorithm and remove the cap. It's easy to do so.
@_date: 2019-10-27 07:30:24
Unless miners agree to change the algorithm. And they will.
@_date: 2019-10-27 07:28:58
No, the algorithm will be changed and the 21M cap removed.
@_date: 2019-10-27 18:20:20
If forks without the 21M cap prove more profitable for miners then they will migrate over to those. Most miners are motivated solely by profit.
@_date: 2019-10-27 07:31:32
You can. Just create another fork without the limit.
@_date: 2019-10-27 19:08:30
It takes time for difficulty to adjust. If most miners migrate to the other fork and the original's difficulty stays the same then its transaction processing speed would grind to a halt. People who actually use crypto to buy stuff would choose the fork where their transactions can be processed in a timely manner. They don't care about all that "scarcity" bullshit and they don't give a damn about block rewards. They also don't care that the new fork is inflationary. They want their drugs or whatever. And they want those drugs NOW. Not after a month or however long it would take for the difficulty to adjust.

So the military industrial complex will still be funded by taxes? They will want to keep the cash flowing. And as they are the military - they have guns and people who are willing to use those guns. And they will use those guns to collect taxes if necessary, because they want to get paid. Sounds like a military dictatorship to me.


If the murder victim or his loved ones aren't wealthy enough then the case will simply be dropped? And only rich people's murders will be investigated and prosecuted?
Police and courts are not profitable. That's not their goal. They exist to enforce the law and keep order. This is why it's nonsense to say that police and courts can work as services. They can't.

What if someone gets murdered? Who will pay the court? Who will pay the police? What if the case is difficult and costly to solve? Will it get dropped if the victim's loved ones run out of cash? Will it be legal to murder poor people?
Your ideas are nonsense.
 And money is not created out of thin air. Its supply is tightly controlled to match the size of the economy and velocity of money to keep inflation stable.
Central banks can't print as much money as they want, because then we'll get hyperinflation like in Zimbabwe.
Bitcoin monetary policy is also very stupid, because the algorithm prints 12.5 BTC every 10 minutes no matter what. This leads to wild price swings and total uncertainty.
@_date: 2019-12-01 17:09:19
And then people will decide to update the code and remove the 21M limit. And boom! Bitcoin is no longer deflationary. Or they will see the danger and simply choose something else.  Just like there's no one world fiat currency - it's unlikely that there will be one world cryptocurrency. Bitcoin itself has at least 3 forks already.

Residential ISPs are not hosting providers. Their infrastructure isn't made for web hosting. Many people connecting to your server will disrupt the service for other ISP users. This is why they prevent you from doing that. 
Web hosting services, data centres and business ISPs have completely different pricing levels and their infrastructure is made for web hosting.

Bitcoin is a lot more traceable than cash. Unlike traditional bank accounts - nobody needs a warrant to trace bitcoins.
@_date: 2019-12-01 22:59:59
Not that long ago one big infamous pedo site was taken down, because the cops managed to find its operators and users by tracing bitcoin transactions. I would definitely not use bitcoin for anything illegal.
Ross Ulbricht tried to tell a bullshit story to the court that he got all those bitcoins by buying low and selling high, but that was quickly debunked by the LEOs who proved that all of his bitcoins came from Silk Road. And the court ordered him to pay the whole $183M back to the government. So yeah - the cops aren't dumb and they know how to analyse the blockchain.
@_date: 2019-12-01 19:59:17
Bitcoin won't kill fiat, because it's designed to be the opposite of fiat. Also if bitcoin price rises then it makes even more sense for me to keep holding bitcoin and pay taxi drivers and handymen with fiat. Why should I give away assets that will be worth more tomorrow? If they want to evade taxes - that's not really my problem.
@_date: 2019-12-01 19:30:48
A bank can protect your wallet much better than you. This is why it would be more attractive for many currency speculators to give their wallet keys to a bank. They won't have to worry about a hacker stealing their wallet from their computer.
@_date: 2019-12-01 17:06:15
If there's a run then people are going to lose their money. Bitcoin banking is still possible, but it's a lot riskier than fiat banking. 
And bitcoin banks exist already.
@_date: 2019-12-25 22:48:41
@_date: 2019-12-01 16:47:38
Yup, because they are smart enough to know that fiat has NEVER been intended as a long-term store of value. It's a means of exchange. You're supposed to spend it on goods and services or invest it in something.
@_date: 2019-12-01 16:44:44
Are you talking about bitcoin miners?
@_date: 2019-12-25 20:01:58
Nobody is trading without a middleman lol. Darknet markets are middlemen. Exchanges are middlemen too.
Bitcoin is not trustless in practice. Even the very first darknet market had an escrow service and you had to trust DPR to not steal your coins. He was one of the first bitcoin middlemen.
@_date: 2019-12-25 22:10:35
That might be against your ISP's TOS. You'll most likely get away with it if your server doesn't have a lot of visitors.
@_date: 2019-12-01 14:25:16
Dude - the government can see and visit your house. They can check the paperwork. They will ask both the original owner and you a lot of unpleasant questions.
That's the problem with real estate - it's impossible to hide it from the government - especially if it's located where the government's agents can actually visit it.
And if you refuse to pay your taxes - they can even CONFISCATE the house and evict you.
@_date: 2019-12-25 19:57:32
That's what I'm saying - without a trusted 3rd party - you send me bitcoins, I send you nothing and keep the coins.
@_date: 2019-12-01 19:11:39
Nobody is forbidden from investing their money. In fact - inflation exists to ENCOURAGE people to do that. You can buy gold, real estate, shares, crypto or whatever else you want. That 0.6% investment is 0.6% because it's pretty much risk-free. The higher the risk, the higher interest you receive. That's economy 101. 
If you buy bitcoin with fiat that means that you're using fiat just like it's supposed to be used. You're not holding it. You're investing it somewhere and as a result fiat is not hoarded and removed from circulation, but continues to circulate further. That might or might not be a wise investment, but it's your choice. So I don't really understand why people think that bitcoin is a threat to fiat. It totally isn't. In fact - the more incentive there is to hold bitcoin, the less threatening to fiat it is.
@_date: 2019-12-01 17:47:10
Banks, governments, three letter agencies, private companies like Chainalysis, etc. All of them will have databases with bitcoin addresses associated with their owners' names. The bank will know your bitcoin address and will have your keys. If your bitcoins ever get used for illegal shit - even indirectly - the government will know  which account to freeze and which house to raid.


Yup, this is why you're not supposed to sit on it. It's a feature not a bug.


Bitcoin sure as hell is risky.
@_date: 2019-12-01 15:59:01
But what if you bought BTC not 10 years ago, but a few months ago? What if you bought BTC 2 years ago for 15k? 
And what if you bought BTC in 2011 and spent it all on drugs?

In order to host your own web server you need a static IP. Many ISPs offer something like that for business users only. (Or don't offer at all). And that's more expensive.
@_date: 2019-12-24 22:12:17
But as soon as you try to exchange your coins the exchange can freeze or straight up steal your bitcoins.   Exchanges have to abide by local laws if they want to keep operating. And you always risk that the exchange is going to get "hacked" and steal your money.
@_date: 2019-12-01 18:33:46
But why would people switch to bitcoin (and not any other altcoin or fork like bitcoin cash)? Euro and USD work just fine. Why should I convert all my savings to bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-12-24 22:46:03


Your local IRS. They can and will investigate any suspicious transaction. You can't hide real estate from them. Unless the house is a total dump - it will cost more than 10k$ and that means that you must use a traceable payment method and fill all the necessary paperwork. 


Yup - that's why it's not wise to keep more than 250k in one bank. 
Anyway - I'd love to have that problem - to decide where to invest 20 millions. 99% of people don't even have those 250k.
@_date: 2019-12-24 22:15:12
Nope - I can't buy a house with bitcoin. The problem is that real estate is impossible to hide. The government will see that the house changed ownership and might investigate the transaction to make sure that dirty money is not involved.


All deposits are insured. But exchanges like MtGox can indeed steal all your money and there's nothing you can do.
@_date: 2019-12-01 17:42:32
Yup - that's a lot of energy per one transaction. Traditional banking system processes a lot more transactions and it spends orders of magnitude less energy per transaction while providing additional features like chargebacks and fraud protection.

@_date: 2019-12-01 21:31:20
But people borrow bitcoins already. Bitcoin exchanges already do bitcoin banking.
@_date: 2019-12-01 17:01:50
But what if you didn't buy it in January, but in July?
@_date: 2019-12-01 16:21:13
But then the banks will keep records of bitcoin address ownership. Bitcoin will become even more traceable than before. I don't see a reason to use bitcoin in this case at all. Might as well keep using Euro. At least I can get a chargeback if I use it.
Criminals will definitely not get involved. You have to be stupid to create an easily to follow paper trail between your drug deal and your bank account. And as the bank has the keys - the government can freeze both the fiat and bitcoin accounts pretty easily.
Why would an average joe need this?
It is only somewhat useful for currency speculators. But if bitcoin is used for speculation exclusively then its value will tank.
@_date: 2019-12-01 23:05:13
Darknet markets are moving to altcoins like monero and zcash already, because they offer better financial privacy. So it's unlikely that the regular black market is going to adopt bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-12-01 16:31:16
It totally does. The bank will have your keys. The government will be able to freeze your account and forbid you to send bitcoin to certain individuals or organisations.  It's like fiat with extra steps then. What's the point?
@_date: 2019-12-01 16:11:01


And now they created a paper trail. The exchange will know who bough it, how much, and their bitcoin address too. And they will happily give all that info to the government.


The exchange will know.
And when they decide to convert BTC to fiat or buy something physical like real estate. Then their IRS will start asking questions. And investigate them for tax evasion, money laundering and other not so funny things. 
Bitcoin has no financial privacy and can be tracked pretty easily.
@_date: 2019-12-01 14:04:22
Police as service, court as service, military as service. Lol. Good luck with that. Meanwhile other countries like China will have tax-funded military with nukes, aircraft carriers and everything else. Only governments can have stuff like that. Those countries will eat your Libertarianland alive.

Can people lend bitcoin to others?
Can people borrow bitcoins?
Can people charge interest for borrowing bitcoin?
Can people establish a corporation that does this?
What do we call corporations like that?
They are...wait for it...BANKS!
Therefore bitcoin banking is possible...and it is happening already.

In case of government collapse your internet might stop working. Good luck accessing your bitcoins then.
@_date: 2019-12-01 20:59:36
But why would others give me bitcoin instead of fiat? Spending bitcoin doesn't make sense. If there's an inflationary alternative then I'll use that instead of bitcoin. Especially for stuff that's safe and legal to do in person. Paying cash is legal and it's the service provider's responsibility to pay taxes. If they don't - that's not my problem.
@_date: 2019-12-01 18:57:23
It is, because traditional banking system is able to process transactions using a lot less energy per transaction.

@_date: 2019-12-24 22:23:22
Exchanges and marketplaces can do that. In both cases you have to trust them - that they won't freeze or straight up steal your money. If you actually use bitcoin as a currency - then yeah - it can be frozen pretty easily.
 You can't really transfer coins to other people directly. They can disappear with your coins and not deliver the goods. That's why 3rd party escrow services exist. And those can steal your coins too.

Banks might get involved, but it will benefit mostly currency speculators. Bitcoin isn't used for legitimate purposes otherwise.
@_date: 2019-12-25 18:25:49


Yeah, that works fine for donations. But if I'm paying for goods and services then I'd need a way to dispute the transaction and issue a chargeback. And that feature indeed isn't part of bitcoin. 
This is why people use 3rd party services that they have to trust. There's no other way. 


Without those bitcoin is useless.
@_date: 2019-12-24 22:36:25
If you buy bitcoin with fiat then you're using fiat exactly as you're supposed to. 
Fiat is not designed to be hoarded. By buying bitcoin you're making an investment and your fiat is transferred to another person and remains in circulation.

@_date: 2019-12-01 18:44:53
Currently even those who don't pay taxes are still protected by the cops. If they're injured or killed - the perpetrator will be caught and brought to justice. Enforcing the law is considered way more important than profit and I'd like for it to stay that way.
The military haven't turned everyone into slaves, because they're accountable to civilian governments and there are laws that make it illegal to use the military against citizens. Currently that civilian government collects taxes and gives some of that collected money to the military. Without that civilian government the military would have to do that themselves.
In some countries with weak and unpopular governments their military forces sometimes topple the government and take the power themselves. Have you heard of military juntas?
I don't know about you, but I'd rather have a civilian government than a military junta or a warlord with his own private militia.
