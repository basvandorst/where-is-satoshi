Sound advice. I am in my late thirties with a paid-for home and a net worth of 500K. And even I am only throwing a few dollars at Bitcoin that I don't mind losing. The majority of the people on here have broken risk meters.

I paid off my house and am now thinking about investing in Bitcoin. First things first, you know?

My home is paid-for so repo is not a scenario. When I was your age I was busy locking in my house payment. Which I now have. First things first, you know? BTC is awesome and I sleep well at night knowing that every dollar I put in, I will not need for at least twenty years.

The good thing about Bitcoin is that it makes 'high-risk' ETF investing feel like a Sunday morning stroll through the park.

But it is illegal to mine Bitcoin in Venezuela, right? How do they deal with that? Is it also illegal to just hold crypto coins..?

Bitcoin in cold storage and receipts to pay with in circulation. Have it your way.

Fact is that Ripple doesn't give a rip about Bitcoin. This makes it a good crypto-hedge against BTC.

Segwit has 8MB blocks, right?

Dates are just a distraction. Keep your eyes on the price!

When people actually want to use crypto, the banks will be ready for it with Ripple (XRP).

You are leaving risk out of the equation.

Indeed. And fiat would be great as an IOU for Bitcoin in cold storage.

All debt represents risk, whether you like it or not.

Alts haven't moved? Ripple is about to moon.

Lol except Ripple. XRP doesn't give a rip about what BTC does or thinks!
