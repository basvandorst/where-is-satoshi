You wrote it down right..... right?
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:01:48
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:02:07
What LN? Last I checked it's not existant
@_date: 2018-01-12 07:01:52
A transaction,once broadcasted, can be rebroadcasteded by the receiver at any time.
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:21:34
Back. Still nothing
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:46:50
I get a nice big ol paywall
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:48:46
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:10:26
Thats not the point. Why pay 10k when you can pay 0k is their point
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:06:04
im sorry, i dont understand the scope of your question. could you perhaps develop it?
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:06:43
Come on man. Everyone knew it was voming for a year. Cojnbase said the release would come towards 2018. Then a few days before the release it was found in their API. 
I bought BCH for these reasons. And im not an inside trader
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:24:17
Can someone delete this garbage post? The person sent .04btc
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:52:44
Just no.
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:07:45
Youre misinformed
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:15:48
Yeah, increase your odds to 100%
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:36:21
the way you try so hard to be is sad. 
sure these outcomes could happen but they wont. the only times empty blocks are mined is when miners accidentally find the next block before even having time to pick their transactions.
being condescending is also rude and immoral. its pretty evident that you try to win arguments by simply using logical fallacies and insults.
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:22:31
could you please enlighten me then? did miners recently stop including the transactions with the highest satoshi per byte fee in their blocks?
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:35:52
ROI is current value (minus) initial investment.
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:01:32
He meant they take the highest fee as in "they select the fee needed to get your transaction in the next block". Which happens to be the highest (logical fee). The use of exaggeration to belittle someone is immoral and rude man.
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:37:51
so youre just nit picking
@_date: 2018-08-22 02:12:51
Ah yes because the amount of transactions being broadcast will NEVER go back up huh?
Or oh wait. THE LIGHTNING NETWORK. Im sure it will save everything. Afyer what 5 years of construction now? And even at that. There are so many issues with it. Basically recentralization.
@_date: 2018-08-22 00:43:47
4 hours aka 3 days????
@_date: 2018-08-22 04:58:54
To answer the question im from 2016
@_date: 2017-02-15 14:19:46
Lol good luck finding that easily and safely
@_date: 2017-02-15 03:07:04
No profit for now.... if a btc is 1000$ some wouldnt mind paying 1050$+ in electricity for it because it will be worth more later
@_date: 2017-02-13 03:21:52
@_date: 2017-02-03 04:43:31
try this 
worked for me
@_date: 2017-02-09 20:57:36
I weigh 500 kilograms
I weigh .5 kilograms
Both are plural; one is a big number
@_date: 2017-01-04 00:14:20
@_date: 2017-01-02 04:14:07
does letting trezor do this for me introduce a level of risk to me? 
@_date: 2017-08-08 05:34:35
Thats not a bch address
@_date: 2017-08-25 23:58:04
What is a "blockchain code"
@_date: 2017-01-02 05:24:53
precisely; my worries are the ramifications that could come of this. especially since each person can press that generate button as much as they want
@_date: 2017-01-10 21:49:36
So thats not binary...
@_date: 2017-01-11 12:52:12
How does that look on your counter
@_date: 2017-01-02 04:49:15
i can see what you mean; but sometimes you win the lottery. i feel as though something should be in place to be sure two randomly generated sequeneces  arent identical
@_date: 2017-01-06 05:09:01
there is a large amount of bitcoin movement today whihc slows the process(due to the crash). to prevent this block sizes would need to be increased but this would decrease miners payouts. so for now we need to hope for lower volume in order for fast transactions
@_date: 2017-01-02 03:48:39
In 40 years from now. The ledger will be of massjve size. The average person may not be able tk download the blockchain... how would one go about moving their coins without teusting a 3rd party
@_date: 2017-01-02 03:42:47
How do you define spending them? Meaning i can only recieve and not send?
@_date: 2017-01-03 22:15:36
@_date: 2017-08-25 03:16:46
Whats wrong with starting with a lot?
@_date: 2017-01-02 04:02:02
Would you happen to know how im able to do this without the ledger?
@_date: 2017-01-02 03:54:19
Could you elaborate?
@_date: 2017-01-07 01:25:44
Gold 2.0 for me
@_date: 2017-01-02 04:37:49
Say i didnt want to use a trezor(or an online wallet or a paper wallet). What would someone do
@_date: 2017-01-02 03:52:15
What control could they have over your coins? 
@_date: 2017-01-02 04:42:49
Impossible or unlikely? (Just like how its unlikely to shuffle a deck of cards the same way twice ever)
@_date: 2017-08-17 04:42:39
Any mirrors for a poor ol Canadian?

@_date: 2017-01-02 03:44:11
What makes it a ripoff? How do they cut out downloading the blockchain? Isnt trezor more secure and wasier to keep track of?
@_date: 2017-01-12 20:41:46
I would if it made sense
@_date: 2017-01-13 22:44:34
@_date: 2017-08-25 23:11:03
@_date: 2017-01-07 00:44:38
Fees so high? They are not even close to a banks fees. (And you can choose your fee). And its fadter than an interac transfer for me
@_date: 2017-01-02 05:40:28
Thats allotta keys
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:34:19
100 shouldnt take 2 days. 100 takes less than 1 day MAX
@_date: 2017-01-02 04:31:14
If its created offline. How does it know that nobody else has the same ? Vice versa
@_date: 2017-01-02 05:03:58
i properly working RNG will be completely random. meaning 2 identicals can still be made before all other posibilities are exhausted
@_date: 2017-01-04 00:50:20
Why did he say that to OP?
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:31:36
You must be good at hiding from them
@_date: 2017-11-08 00:08:15
Sounds like someone is gettin fired. Never mess with the bossmans gains
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:30:09
Or perhaps its wrong again and youre ignoring the confirmation bias?
@_date: 2017-11-14 07:10:14
The level at which governmaents are avlw to decrease demand are negligible (and costly). It would be much more efficient to take out suppliers.
@_date: 2017-11-03 06:35:08
Im not sure you realize how much btc you could earn at that time. Gis state saying he has more than 21 is pointing  to the fact that 21 is mear pennies compared to his fortune
@_date: 2017-11-14 06:58:28
Now you know how vitalik feels about you.
@_date: 2017-11-14 06:11:41
Is this comment your way of discrediting the opinion the account is broadcasting?
@_date: 2017-11-14 06:42:37
Account whos username clearly asks for naked picturss of people against this? You know children use reddit? Are you trying to support child porn? Why would you be doing such a horrible thing? How could anything you ever say or think hold any value now? 
@_date: 2017-11-14 06:47:34
So if you text me the picture of a toddlers penis, i have now automatically become a criminal? I didnt want this picture, but now ots on my phone and ive seen it, and by your terms thats enough to be a CP supporter.
@_date: 2017-11-14 06:55:47
If we look at simple physics.
If we observe a ball at the top of a hill. It is not currently moving so it has no energy. But theres something called potential energy. This is the enrgy thst would come of the ball rolling down the hill. Are we going to start arresting all balls for being their potential to roll down the hill? I think not!
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:41:09
What if im on the receiving end? ;)
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:34:04
I wish!
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:33:02
Consider the following. 
Im a seller
I come in contact with a buyer online.
He sends the btc
I send the product
Btc takes too long to confirm and drops out of the mempool
How do i get my btc back?
Surely the buyer will not be very keen on the idea of resending!
@_date: 2017-11-14 06:31:48
I dont personally feel he regrets his statement. Its an interesting perspective which merits deep consideration. The idea of right and wrong may ve objective but the idea of good and bad (which its based on) is not. And i support the opening of civil discussions challenging the topic
@_date: 2017-11-14 06:13:39
Whats wrong with him offering to have private talks?
@_date: 2017-04-01 19:24:00
Its judt a link to a 5 yesr old post. Im confused how this canvas works
@_date: 2017-09-06 04:02:04
I cant imagine i have. And if i did id research it. Not just wait for someone to come solve my simple problem
@_date: 2017-09-06 00:38:21
A question as uninformed as such has never crossed my mind. And to grasp bitcoin enough to be a competant user only takes a few hours of videos
@_date: 2017-09-05 02:05:31
Now we need to find a way to turn this into a meme like the first HODL guy
@_date: 2017-09-01 01:31:37
Why do you have 8btc on an online wallet.....
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:14:58
Quite condescending of you to say. 
r/gatekeeping might enjoy you. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 02:48:54
Sooooo u mad?
@_date: 2017-09-05 20:52:14
This question is too retarded to possibly answer 
@_date: 2017-09-02 18:18:42
Buy bitcoin with coinbase and store it on mycelium or breadwallet
@_date: 2017-09-05 02:25:37
Well put. I know the feels. Empty mempool but still requiting huge miner fees. BS. Dynamic fees please
@_date: 2017-09-02 17:46:08
You have enough money to risk on gambling but cant afford to hold your winnings? Seems to me you shouldnt have made the bet in the first place
@_date: 2017-10-31 17:13:58
950 here
@_date: 2017-09-05 21:07:05
How is someone supposed to help him when hes inventing things? Breadwallet only holds btc. And coins dont just transform into others. 
The only theory i have is he had the btc  before the fork and doesnt understand  what to do with his NEW coins and not transformed ones
@_date: 2017-10-30 21:18:24
I mean u have -16. Theres nothing there to look at
@_date: 2017-10-08 00:48:13
A girl holding an ipad with a qr code looking down in confusion. Well this is completely solid evidence.
@_date: 2017-10-22 18:05:57
Its centralized and the value diesnt matter to banks. Its instantly converted back to fiat when it gets to its destination.
@_date: 2018-04-15 23:11:05
Revolutionary. 
@_date: 2017-07-02 22:24:58
People like you make me believe the crypto bubble is real
@_date: 2017-07-06 13:51:53
Same problem for me
@_date: 2017-07-01 15:57:11
@_date: 2017-07-15 11:47:59
What happens to everyones money aha
@_date: 2017-07-02 22:45:18
The ends do not justify the means... i hope god still has the heart to bless your soul
@_date: 2017-07-16 18:16:41
Damned bear markets
@_date: 2017-07-15 05:40:00
So... what does this mean for the site
@_date: 2017-07-14 22:58:00
Ahahaha i get the feeling this is your address ;)
@_date: 2017-06-28 22:52:44
An account is an accumulation of addresses. Thisis what makes bitciins hard to trace. One person can own hindreds of addresses in one place without any relation between them being seen.
