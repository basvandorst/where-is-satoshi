No joke - the price was at 17,500, I went to the bathroom, and when I came back, it was at 18,500.
Most profitable pee ever!

I have a 40 oz. water bottle right next to me. Give me an hour or so.

No, I'm holding on tight, and feeling pretty good.

I have several times since this afternoon and it hasn't gone up :(  
Also, this is a weird topic to be continuously talking about in the Bitcoin subreddit

That's still amazing and you should be proud of taking a chance on this!

Aw, thanks &lt;

I was expecting a response like that, and it's not entirely undeserved. It's actually good, because it reminds me to stay away from here, because everybody is angry and agressive and says "Hodl" and constantly posts that freaking Bollywood gif.  
Good luck, everyone! Bye for now!

I sold at $4800 at 9:00 AM (Eastern Time) on Wednesday (10/11). I figured with all the commotion over the fork, there wouldn't be much change for awhile, and hopefully even a dip. Plus, I was getting very obsessive about watching the price.  
Less than 24 hours later, the price exploded higher than ever. It sucks a bunch, but I'm trying not to get too bummed out about it. I had &lt;1 BTC, so it's not like I missed out on millions, and at least made some money, but it still sucks.
I just bought a little bit at 5,500 a couple hours ago.  And I've been obsessively watching the price since yesterday morning.
