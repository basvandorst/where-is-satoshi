Guys... I know you love to hate BTC-e, but those skype accounts are fake. They are all scammers. BTC-e does not *support*.

Still no other commenters - anyway... Yes, liberalism is far too *comfortable* for my liking. It takes all the radical edge out of political engagement and assumes that the market can solve our problems, which it can't. I am speaking specifically of impending environmental crises, problems of global governance and a general tendency towards *short-term* gain as opposed to long-term stability. As such liberalism fits the definition of an ideology; it is "an imaginary solution to real contradictions".

Sorry.. I withdrew BTC from BTC-e yesterday. And today. BTC-e stopped transactions for maybe... 2h-4h tops.

Cool, so in future I can buy 3d filament for my 3d printer, to print a throwaway physical bitcoin with a qr code on the back to give to a friend as a present? Neat.
Bring on the future.

Retreat into pluralism. A sure sign of a liberal ideology at work. Listen, I don't have a problem with argument - I have much more of a problem with 'let's not argue' - it betrays a regression of your (and mine) standpoint into supposedly 'neutral' territory. What I am trying to say is precisely that your experiential 'pluralism' is not *neutral*, but a veiled oppression of those whom it excludes and a suppression of discourse on something very important - I would think, especially here; namely the regulation and control of money and (qua) *value*. I ask more directly: what would you say makes your 'sentimental' objects exempt from the sphere of commodities and what makes you so sure that the cooperation you witness is indeed of a higher logical type than the competition I witness?
NB: Not personal, but yes, a bit personal. Please, none of this 'agree to disagree' bullshit. Makes my head spin.
Edit: I upvoted your comment for visibility. This is a better topic than many above.

Exactly. What I want is billboards to market the most profitable line of work (for the people putting up the billboards); TV commercials pushing cults; and plastic roads and bridges, which may or may not be safe, but cost $1m a year to use. I also want my guns, my dynamite, I WILL FIGHT I WILL FIGHT I WILL FIGHT AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH YES ILL FIGHT FOR MA LIBERTY TO BE FREE FROM GOVERNMENT
EDIT: May I suggest, temporarily, a 'middle-way' where we can instate certain constitutional (quasi-socialist) dictums to curb market forces, then move towards global second-order cybernetic systems of self-control?

Oh what the hell. They make their money off ads and subscriptions, not single-issue buys. All of that money goes to the newsstand+delivery personnel.
I say, just charge 0.01BTC per issue or 0.1 for a year's subscription. Now THAT would be novel.

Can you explain please? I think I know what you are saying - gox has the coins… but what is this meaning of this chart?
@_date: 2014-02-21 13:50:56
From Stackexchange:
The idea of "bitcoin days destroyed" came about because it was realised that total transaction volume per day might be an inappropriate measure of the level of economic activity in Bitcoin. After all, someone could be sending the same money back and forth between their own addresses repeatedly. If you sent the same 50 btc back and forth 20 times, it would look like 1000 btc worth of activity, while in fact it represents almost nothing in terms of real transaction volume.
With "bitcoin days destroyed", the idea is instead to give more weight to coins which haven't been spent in a while. To do this, you multiply the amount of each transaction by the number of days since those coins were last spent. So, 1 bitcoin that hasn't been spent in 100 days (1 bitcoin * 100 days) counts as much as 100 bitcoins that were just spent yesterday (100 bitcoins * 1 day). Because you can think of these "bitcoin days" as building up over time until a transaction actually occurs, the actual measure is called "bitcoin days destroyed". This is believed to give a better indication of how much real economic activity is occurring on the bitcoin network.

And somewhere along the way we have made use value subservient to exchange value and human co-operation subservient to competition.
Whatever happened?

Great to see academics take an interest. There is a blog post by Yanis Varoufakis and a lengthy comment thread with yet more links here:
You have a typo here: *...the study of market embeddedness has tended to focused on the study

@_date: 2014-02-07 00:06:49
Haha. You think abstaining from some brand fetish is 'political action'. Bitcoin itself may become a political instrument, but [be careful what you wish for]( Bitcoin is essentially ultra-conservative. The inclusion of yet another untapped economic resource (the 'unbanked' or 'underbanked') into the market, through an essentially uncontrollable virtual currency held mostly by a small minority, marks, if anything, a point in the intensification and acceleration of free-market liberalism. Bitcoin will make sure that even people without credit cards can spend their last cents on porn apps, online gambling and drugs. This is  not the kind of 'technological freedom and empowerment' the cypherpunks had in mind, and it is a sign of Apple's continued adherence to the principles of Jobs and Woz that they are weary of Bitcoin in its current form.
Someone had to say it. Now vote me deep underground.
Yes, devil's advocate. But frankly I'm tired of seeing you all agree with yourselves all the time, especially when it comes to 'big' questions.

And what about coinbase and their estimate of 24-72h for a fix? Thats not indefinite.
Damn lazy reporters.
But as we know every local paper that wants to do a little story on Bitcoin will copy Reuters. Prepare for joe-moron to think bitcoin was hacked.

You forget that whatever sentimental value you attach to 'your' objects, is ultimately part of what *you* sell.
I see cooperation too, but only as part of larger schemas of competition, individual fulfilment and short-term *survival*.

I was shocked by the impossibility of just scrolling through the HEISE comments. How the f* do you expand them all in thread view?? It's like sucking a golfball through a garden hose to follow these conversations. Anyway. "Otto normalo" is scared of evil speculators. The fact that they are speculating on the end of speculation has yet to hit him.

The coins are legit. Gox is uncertain that you had them in the first place. They came from their hot-wallet I suppose.

Very relaxing, but what am I seeing here? Can someone explain? Thanks.

These ideas came from a time when people actually believed the market could regulate itself. Whether or not that may have been true, we have spent at least 100 years occasionally (over-)regulating it and now we are stuck with a very unequal distribution of global wealth. If you deregulate it now, you will get a quasi-autocratic regime consisting of a handful of mega-conglomerates with enough marketing power to pay off all critics and swing opinion to whatever is best suited for further extraction of wealth. This will mean a temporary rise in (your) middle-class wealth (the pay-off); then, a drastic drop in the lower-class's ability to feed itself, and then ultimately an implosion when working conditions become untenable. The middle class which has not joined the upper echelons will then, also, starve, and become the new lower class. The people at the top will have gone to live on elysium.

You need to email IT support and get friendly with them. Finance does not care *how* you pay your fees. You need to convince IT to get on your side and install a Bitpay gateway.

I think Gox told BTC-e to hold funds coming from them while they clean up their their wallet code and check for double spends.

Maybe this is the only viable form of protest nowadays?
Consumers protesting business decisions. We're not going to move two-party-politics off the beaten track with our placards anymore, so let's protest against Apple app-store regulation, where we still stand a chance of effecting change, so we can feel like 'we're doing something'. What a rotten century.

Hi and thanks for doing this!
Here are my questions:
1) Is Bitcoin still (was it ever) prevalent in mainstream media - like here; the Financial Times is covering it regularly; occasional TV broadcasts in the US and EU.
2) Are there Chinese darknet markets? Do they use bitcoin? Any news about crackdowns like here with SR, SR2?
3) To the best of your knowledge - please speculate wildly - how will your government/PBOC handle crypto-currency from here on?
4) Have you seen any bitcoin stickers in your city, bitcoin ATMs, shops accepting BTC?
5) What is the average Joe's (of China) opinion of bitcoin? Like here, I would say Joe thinks Bitcoin is shady internet money for drugs and speculators, but may become useful (paypal) later. Some think it is "the people's money".
6) How prevalent are alternative forms of payment in general - sms payments, call to pay, vouchers, credit/debit, airline miles, supermarket points, etc? How many people pay using NFC? Have terminals in major cities been upgraded?
7) Do you know of any Chinese academics or experts with useful comments about bitcoin?
Thank you!

Full of grammatical errors and typos. Also over-designed and poorly researched. Tons of conjecture and no theory. No point even beyond the basic premise of "analyzing the ecosystem"; unrelated to any economic or political theory. A thesis like this would only stand up in a subject like "e-business" and certainly not in economics or an arts and humanities department. This paper is better and peer reviewed: 
Sorry guy; A for effort.

No one has the keys. They are in various locations held by trusted parties. Probably they don't even know what they are holding on those USB sticks.
Morbid as this is… I'm sure this is one thing they planned for.
