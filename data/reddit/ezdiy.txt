Litecoin history is kinda clusterfuck with all the premining and reddit/forum shilling.
No value added in comparison to bitcoin. Potentially vulnerable network to ASIC (actually, scrypt ASIC would be useful for many other purposes, shrug). Four times faster blocks without more revolutionary protocol changes mean LTC will hit scalability issues in that regard sooner etc.
Read up on the forums for more or less objective criticism of other blockchains.
100% speculative commodity.
(disclosure: yes, it's profitable to be flipping LTC and TRC to whichever fool buys it)

I believe it's up to 26kbtc for mtgox actually, since both parties of trade pay the fee. It could be lower in theory, since fees are tiered by volume of a trade (seems insignificant in current state of affairs).
SD is singlehandledly the most profitable in terms of ROI ([zero development cost](  ), however it's shady and disaster waiting to happen, unless bitinstant actually bothers to obscure the fact it's being run by them.

Note that on mpex/icbit and similiar sites youre betting against bot in a closed system.
It's a  - your profits are limited by what is the counterparty willing to pay, instead of potentially unlimited profits extracted from real market.
At least bitcoinica was kind enough to actually pass through to mtgox when local collateral was not enough...

About -10%.

I think bitcoinity should totally have the nyansnail popping confettis or something every time this happens :)
(seriously though, seems like someone just discovered the obvious way to DoS gox by posting partially-covered order ladder).

Long answer: Yes, but you'll not see it. Bulls are fast, bears bite it slowly in the long run.
Hoping for panic sell is unlikely assuming magicaltux got his php shit together since the last time, the market is also much deeper to withstand minor FUDs (mostly thanks to guys like you :)

You jelly?
Seriously though, most of us are in ~10-100BTC range. And there is *thousands* of us.
A guess just pulled from my arse is that this price hike transferred about 200k-1M of bitcoins into hands of small time investors.
Thats the big idea here - old whales are unable to create price hikes like this one (and raise the overall fundamentals when rush fades off), they've their own sources than direct currency market competition.
Zergling rush is the *only* way.
If you're all sour grapes about old whales who are now sitting on more than 50% of all coins, it's just history repeating itself. It's literally "old money" now, in the internet age sense. Frankly i'm glad those are the likes of gavin, garzik etc, and not goldman's &amp; co.

It'd be nice to have complement of 'Have you ever payed for goods or services with Bitcoins?', ie have you ever been paid for goods/services to get an idea how vendors are represented (compared to massive eshops like bitcoinstore).

Kudos to you for announcing spam .self :) You're better than that amazon gift card guy.

1. mtgox / coinlab
2. satoshidice / bitinstant
3. bitpay
4. memorydealers / bitcoinstore
The first two are just incubent cryptobarons, hardly any value delivered besides first to market. 3-4 from what i know are legit bitcoin startups.
There are dozens of copycats of each, but are severely lagging behind.
SR and other escrow dark markets in general are not that big actually.

Fuck yeah, let's hoard terracoins and litecoins too (despite having no use besides speculation whatsoever :)
How to get bitcoins for dummies:
1. mine
2. speculate
3. get paid in btc
Each level is progressively harder as time goes on because each segment is more crowded. Ultimately 3. is the whole point of bitcoin though (and providing tangible value besides being just lucky).
Economic chicken'n'egg 101: The harder it is to get coins on open market, the more are people likely to start up new business in BTC since it's too hard for them to just speculate.
The more there is tangible economy, the softer will be the landing when the gold fever cools off.

Anything with preorders screams danger.
I really like how ASICMINER did it - do an IPO, state risks, weekly updates &amp; expenses, voting from shareholders and all that jazz.
HW vendor can simply give preference to shareholders in the first batch. Further profits are subject to usual corporate equity.
IPO is basically glorified crowdfunding, minus the usual altruism of kickstarter.

Arbitrage trader here. Just buy on mtgox, sell/flip everywhere else (btce, bfloor, btc24, bitcoin.de.. take your poison, consult wiki and charts). If you want to decrown mtgox, there must be *much* more of us than just few guys with few tens of measly coins.
HINT: Time to verify cross-exchange BTC transfers is super important. Zero fees on BTC is another bonus. Wire delays are irrelevant - you need decent capital on gox to burn through and then move it via BTC exclusively.
