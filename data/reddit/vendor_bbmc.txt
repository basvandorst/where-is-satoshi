I always assumed that the IP address of the device hosting the wallet from which a transaction was broadcast was stored within the transaction, so Tor would be a pointless extra set of computers between the wallet and the greater blockchain.

Since Oasis marketplace exit-scammed, many of its users seem to have started using alphabay.
Alphabay is the largest darknet marketplace with a tumbler for vendor withdrawals. Its this which is filling every block to capacity from Thursdays to Saturdays.
Anybody who wants to get on the first bus has to pay a bribe to jump the queue. Here, even today's blocks are 998kb, 999kb in size   and its only Monday.
Bitcoin is always driven by the largest Darknet marketplace, and it's tumbler turns a single withdrawal into hundreds of transactions.
The Mempool started going nuts around October 10th   and where there are queues, there are fees.

It's expensive to be cryogenically frozen, and expensive to stay frozen.
If the blockchain is forked, you would expect bad blocks to suddenly appear. This occurred in April 2014 (you can see a bad blocks graph on blockchain.info).
We shouldn't be too harsh on Hal/Satoshi for this.
Bitcoin is decentralised, but before Satoshi died it used to be centralised around what Satoshi thought. If we could unfreeze and cure his wasting disease, "satoshi"would sort this block size arguement with one email.

Satoshi has gone silent since Hal died.
When sending the first bitcoin transaction, it would obviously use wallets on two computers owned by the developer, for troubleshooting.
Hal "received" the first bitcoins. He also "sent" them (no coins actually move, its just numbers changing in the ledger that is the blockchain)

The Daily Mail is trying to put a positive spin on anti money-laundering regulation.
Americans always assume that they must be running bitcoin somehow. If its centralized anywhere, its the place that "New" York is named after.
In Britain, we trust our money to be l,ooked after by tightfisted folk:- ie Yorkshiremen, or Scots.
We trust the Leeds, Bradford &amp; Bingley, Yorkshire Bank, the Halifax with our money in a way that we wouldn't trust the Bank of Essex.
The UK ended up hosting more than 50% of the blockchain by not hating bitcoin like the US, and by robbing people slightly less than other countries.

The size of each new block is limited to be less than the size of a floppy disk, and the blockchain is already too unwieldy for most people to run a full client wallet.
There's a limit to how much topping can be piled on top of that particular cracker. They couldn't be more obvious scams even if they claimed to keep bitcoin in a satellite or a nuclear bunker.
That's how you know that these innovative products built on the blockchain are scams.
The blockchain is just a bunch of bar tabs that store numbers.
Even to write your own name where A=1 and Z =26 is expensive.
Unless you are Cher

awkward. Who's going to tell him?
You're going to see that photo a lot before 2140.
I know it was unintentional, so its funny. But Satoshi wasn't walking the earth much even when he was alive.
Or maybe he's just been keeping a low profile recently.
