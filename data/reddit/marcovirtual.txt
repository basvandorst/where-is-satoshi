Heya, did you complete your trasfer? I'm thinking about using quoinex and would like to know if it is safe.

Nice. So simple, even for a newbie like me. Just hope they'll be able to fix the remaining bugs. Electrum will greatly increase LN adoption.

Someone is offering in person buying and selling services of Bitcoin in my neighborhood. 
I'm thinking about selling him some btc, instead of using an exchange. It would happen in a safe space with lots of people (a shopping mall).
1) What steps should be taken to avoid being scammed?
2) What can be done to avoid waiting 20-60 min confirmation times? Even though I don't want to get scammed, I also don't don't want to stay there for that long.
3) I only have experience with the PC version of Electrum. What would be the best Android app to use for this transaction?

What caused this [great rise in segwit adoption]( in March 2018?
At that time, it suddenly went from 15% to 30%. Now it's around 40%. 
What single event do you think could drive adoption even further?

Treat himself to a happy meal.

Don't come here. No one knows about bitcoins and everything [costs too much](

This is something I've been questioning a lot lately. Even if you spread your bitcoins through multiple wallets, if you cash in/out through some type of currency exchange they will know who you are, as they have your bank account etc.
Through the blockchain, everybody knows the wallets that have the highest amount of bitcoins. If those wallets are tied to a currency exchange and a real bank account, it's certainly feasible to track someone down. The NSA could probably do it.
I hope I'm wrong though. Can anyone change my view?

I'm genuinely curious: why wouldn't the 51% attack he talked about be an accurate possibility? With all the power revealed to be had by the NSA recently on major networks worldwide, I don't think his statement may be too far from the truth.
