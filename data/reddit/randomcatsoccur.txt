You can find your account with bitcoin and you can withdraw bitcoin from your account no problem. Just pay the appropriate fee and you'll be fine. Also 2FA if you're going to have your stuff sitting on the site.

Set up a wallet blockchain.info/wallet. If you're in murica, use bitfloor to make a cash deposit via Bank of America. Wait for funds to show up on your bitfloor. Exchange that fiat into bitcoins by buying at overpriced market value or waiting until there is a dip to swoop the cheap coins. Transfer the coins to your wallet address. Sit on it. Don't worry about the dips. Sit on it. Keep calm. Wait.

In my opinion, I'd say an infographic of some kind will be a good addition. Of course the video on weusecoins is good, however we have to remember that the average person has a short attention span when it comes to videos that seem like a lecture. 
For example, I showed the site weusecoins.com and the video to a few people that I felt would be interested but I could tell that they stopped around the 30s mark when it got into explaining mining. They lost interest and didn't seem as thrilled as we all are in this subreddit. 
I feel that it's more about presentation, and the amount of content that is presented. I don't have a lot of experience when it comes to marketing a product to a new audience, but I do know how I feel when something is being pitched to me. 
Some questions I ask when something is being thrown my way is:
* Why is is so great?
* Is it free?
* Where and when can I use it? 
* Is it legal?
* Why should I even care about it?
In the context of Bitcoin, I'd say we try to give people the relevant and applicable details (without dumbing it down too much) of how powerful investing and owning Bitcoins can be. I don't know if I'm asking for too much. I was thinking of a simple infographic that presents what a bitcoin is, what it can do, why is it great, and how it works (without getting TOO technical to the point where a potential reader is turned off). 
* People should know why btc is great
* That it is free and better than the dollar
* Where to get their wallet and that there are apps (blockchain wallet app)
* Whether or not they'll get in trouble
* Why it should be something to consider over debit/credit cards and money. 
When I first read about btc in 2009-10, I was initially interested but after reading into the whole mining, hashrates, blocks, etc. and all the other jargon that I found, it scared me away. This year when the price was shooting up I had to make an effort to do extensive research as to how it worked before buying my first btc. And still, I was hesitant to make the jump but I'm glad I did. I just feel the average person (as well as the below-average-person) has to be held by the hand and spoon-fed information, because not everyone is proactive in clicking too many links to find out what something is especially if it has to do with their hard-earned money.

Let's make a new subreddit called ~~**EDIT: There's already a subreddit apparently 
@_date: 2013-03-26 23:53:08
Is the blockchain app bugged too? It used to be able to show my BTC in USD but I no longer have that option anymore 
@_date: 2013-04-02 20:32:19
1. Why do you say it's too hard? I'd say for Americans it's quite simple if they use the bitfloor approach. I was able to buy $20 worth of BTC yesterday during an errand and I had my coins within 30 minutes.
2. Of course media does that, when has mainstream media ever openly accepted something that is new and unique? Remember what the media said about the Internet? 
3. Well of course infrastructure needs to be set-up. You're jumping to conclusions by saying there are not enough physical goods for sale. Sit down man! This Bitcoin phenomenon has just started, don't expect things like tangible actual Bitcoin stores to start propping up everywhere in the world. Be realistic, these kinds of things take time. It's all a matter of establishing an infrastructure and reinforcing it.
4. I agree with your point, however, something like Bitcoin would be hard to explain through a single Facebook post or a Tweet. Something like Bitcoin involves some actual dedicated reading and research before adopting it. And for the average person using social media? I seriously doubt their capacity to actually read into something like Bitcoin, it needs to be "dumbed down" for them to even be interested. 
5. As for too many investors, I'm sure they are playing the waiting game. But we'll have to see. It can go both ways. Again, we need a solid infrastructure before any actual digital/physical exchanges take place. Look at mtgox, I don't think the site ever anticipated this kind of anticipation so they're playing catch-up right now.
Things are off to a rocky start, the numbers look good on the exchanges but let's take this one step at a time if we want Bitcoin to succeed. I rushed in typing this up, but this is just my opinion!
@_date: 2013-03-30 05:11:48
Back in 2009, I remember reading forums of people who were praising it. People were really pushing to invest in it in the following months. I shrugged it off and called them stupid. And here I am today playing catch-up when I should've dumped bought up $500 dollars worth of bitcoins back then.

I'd go with Bitfloor, I've used them twice in the past 2 weeks and my funds arrived on the site within 30 minutes. As for the exchange rate it is pricey however, I'm okay with it knowing that my funds actually reached the site in due time. Once my funds were there I turned them into Bitcoin and sent them to my blockchain wallet asap.
@_date: 2013-04-02 04:00:18
Don't worry about it. I remember when the Google search result for "Internet" said the same thing.

For anyone else who is planning on going "all-in," do a test run first and only transfer like 1 BTC to see if it will go through to your wallet. And once it's confirmed, go ahead and move the rest of your coinz!

Another thing you can do if you're earning BTC/money from your website is to encourage people to keep using your service by offering an incentive like "use our website to buy tickets 10 times and earn a free ticket." Of course you'd have to work out some kind of system to keep track of who is who and offer like a redeemable code or something for the free ticket.

It claims to be able to have realtime updates of "a weighted average" of all the exchanges, I guess that's cool. But I'd also like it to have realtime updates from specific exchanges as well. Such as bitfloor.

Lol it's basically a "it's cool with us" deal as long as Bitcoin doesn't overshadow their precious dollar. When that happens they'll be like "stay out of my territory" and the banhammer comes down.

Also another good idea IMO is to create a "tl;dr/bitcoins for dummies" guide. Or a site that explains bitcoins in layman's terms for regular joes and janes. 
When I first heard of bitcoins in 2009-10, only thing I thought of was that it was stupid internet "matrix" money! I could only assume that a regular person today would probably feel the same way if bitcoins were being pitched at them. 
Just my thoughts.
@_date: 2013-03-27 23:28:55

My advice to anyone who is on the fence. Put in what you're okay with losing overnight. Any amount, and you don't have to buy a WHOLE Bitcoin. I honestly believe that no matter how many players there are in this game, no matter if the price rises and falls $20 a day, I feel that the value (intrinsic, monetary, commodity, store of value, etc.) will still appreciate as time goes on.
@_date: 2013-04-02 04:39:58
