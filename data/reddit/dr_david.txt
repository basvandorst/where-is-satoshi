Well, that makes one of us, then.....

Perhaps, just maybe, you should wipe the smug smile off your face. Just saying. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 19:53:29
Is that supposed to mean something to me?
@_date: 2014-02-17 19:25:02
Looking forward to it...

So, are you accusing mtgox of actively committing fraud? I'm pretty sure that they don't act as a market maker, so, they're real coins... Unless of course you know something I don't know?
Bottom line is that I don't pay 50% of the 'value' of currency because I buy it from a bank/money changer that doesn't allow withdrawals within 6 months of the purchase..
Seriously, do you guys actually listen to yourselves? The complete crap you're spouting just shows how insanely delusional you all are...

That's pretty much what happens here.
I just got down voted to hell and told that I'm an idiot because I questioned why a currency could be worth $310 at one place, and $650 at another. It strains credulity to believe that this is anything other than a massive ponzi scheme/bubble.
These assholes vote dissension down immediately.

Einstein, Pascal, and Newton are playing hide and go seek. Einstein is counting while Newton and Pascal hide. Pascal runs off and hides while Newton doesn’t move an inch. Instead, he draws a square around himself in the dirt. After Einstein finishes counting, he opens his eyes and says, “Found you Newton! That was easy.”
Newton says, “No you didn’t. You found Pascal.” He points down to the square in the dirt. “One Newton per square meter.”
And, my number: 912

So, how do I get free bitcoins too? Seriously, if I posted that I lost $900 on some Apple calls this week (true story), will Reddit help me get my money back too?
Just in case free bitcoins will be given:
But, in all seriousness, there probably should be a 2-factor authentication option for bitcoin-qt. It would make the wallets that much more secure IMHO..

I'd use it to try to make even more bitcoin! Invest and profit ;)

Wow. Speechless..

Can someone tell me again how mining fees and network fees are somehow completely different than bank fees? Like I should feel better about paying 10% of my transaction to the bitcoin network vs. 2.5% to PayPal....

OMG! What if you could build a time machine, bring a BFL miner back to when the hash rate was WAY lower, and it was WAY easier to mine.. You'd own like all the bitcoins! Then, go forward and sell all your hordes of bitcoins to the people who want to get rid of their $32 Trillion in offshore accounts. Peg the exchange rate at $1 Billion per bitcoin. You'd be RICH!!!!!
