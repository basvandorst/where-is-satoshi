I thought that the scientific way was to make observations, gather data, then form theories to explain the data. The fact that bitcoin is being used as money is an observation about a real world fact. You don't get to question it. All these economists would be better engaged in changing their theories of money to fit the facts, not the other way round.
@_date: 2014-06-11 21:35:15
yep, the long term effect is an increase in price. The fact is, any given person has x % of his net worth that he wants to keep in bitcoin as an investment. x does not go down after a new company accepts bitcoin. Worst case, it stays the same. So if person A wants to buy from the new company, he will have to buy bitcoin to maintain x.

Because there is only a finite number of plausible 'schools of thought' for understanding the world, and they have all been thought of before. Also, the theory on each of them has likely been developed by other people to a greater extent than you could achieve by yourself. So you can either accept the label, or pretend that you're unique when actually you aren't.

I can't speak for other countries, but in the UK, localbitcoin margins have fallen from 7% above bitstamp a year ago to 2-3% now. I've seen it as low as 1% over stamp.  When it's this low, people have no real incentive to send money to an exchange, as it's easier to just buy on LBC, and avoid the hassle. In the UK it's more than just hassle, as to buy on an exchange you would need an international transfer, costing you 2-4% in exchange rates, plus the exchange fee. But anywhere else, 1,2 or 3% is still not going to put many people off, as people understand the concept of convenience4cash

I doubt it. I assume you're asking if a bitcoin address could be generated such that the corresponding QR forms a recognizable picture. In other words a specific type of vanity address. I guess someone could do the math on image entropy (not me), but I suspect it would take years to generate anything as recognizable as these. It would be fairly quick to generate something that kind-of sort-of looks like something if you squint your eyes, but the more 'high res' you get, the more orders of magnitude you will pile on to the difficulty.
You would also need some pattern recognition code for automatically rating each QR for 'recognizability', which would be non-trivial.

I really can't work out what the hell is going on with this graph.
The x axis is 'years since technology invention'. Ok, so why then are the lines going the wrong way? e.g. It looks like the automobile started 110 years ago at 70% ownership, then became 0% owned 25 years ago..
Also, the automobile was certainly not invented 23 years before 1970 (which I assume is the zero for the graph. If the zero is a later year, then its even MORE wrong). It was actually invented in the 1800s.
And as others have said, why is each line labelled twice? 
Ok, so let's say the lines should be the other way round. Except that doesn't make sense either, unless you both reflect each line AND move it sideways to the correct year! Otherwise the ends of each line won't line up! Even then I'm not sure if it would work viz the invention dates, and I'm too lazy to check right now.

Communism - started with good intentions, but was a flawed idea from the beginning. The bad guys were always going to take over.
Capitalism - the bad guys who took over were governments and their accomplices. See Communism.
Anarchism - has never been successful enough for any bad guys to bother taking over. 
Liberalism - is just a mix of socialism(--&gt;communism) and capitalism. 
Internet - the NSA is watching, but I'm not sure this counts as 'taking over'
Bitcoin - remains to be seen, but being decentralized is a non-trivial advantage.

Ok, rephrase. Government is the *root* of the problem. The point being that if you chop off the root, then you kill all the leaves as well. The government are a single entity which, when removed, solves the problem. There is no other such single entity. If you try chopping off leaves and branches, others will grow to replace them. Ergo, government is the root / source of the problem.

Couldn't agree more. But does one entity have to have a monopoly on providing that service? 
@_date: 2013-04-21 17:19:41
1. I could say 100 things about this, but I'll keep it brief.  Filesharing is not what will kill governments.  What will kill governments is the gradual increase in off-the-grid products and services, which will permeate the entire value chain, from ore mining all the way to smart phones. I'm talking about people being paid in tax free bitcoins, and spending it on tax free stuff. It won't happen overnight, but gradually. And the more money goes off the radar, the less revenue the gubmint has to chase people down with. There will be big incentives for people to switch.
By the way, re. downloads, you have to wait an 'indeterminate time' whether it's itunes or torrent, and the conversion is not really an issue as most devices support mp3. And do you have a source for the claim that itunes usage outpaces bittorrent? And don't forget about youtube :)
2. Two things: one, 99c is a bigger deal than you think for much of the world. two, as I said above it's not about filesharing, it's about other forms of "piracy"  which are potentially much more lucrative. I only used bittorrent to compare the difficulty of outlawing all of this.
3. ok, it started off as a question of definitions. I can't really comment on the subtleties of economic policy, except to say that the central management question and the deflation effects question are two different things. So 1 question has turned into 3 :) Aint nobody got time for that.
4. There will always be some who pay out of fear, there will always be some who pay out of misguided statism. But the governments ability to fund the witch hunt will only dwindle, whilst the witches multiply out of control. Plus, you can only audit something that has a paper trail. Re the last point, that's a question of politics which I don't think will factor much either way.
@_date: 2013-10-04 09:32:27
A block chain fork could kill it, if it's contentious and splits opinion amongst miners. Or if it forks the wrong way, allowing another crypto to take over, or if it fails to update when it should, or if the security is broken.

Yes and no. When I first used Paypal, it wasn't because I thought "hey, here's a way I can be sure of getting a chargeback if something goes wrong". It was because Ebay insists on Paypal. That's it.

firstly. Bitcoins, or some other cryptocurrency, certainly DOES have the potential to overthrow banks and governments. Making it illegal won't help in the long run. See bittorrent. Exchanges can be tracked, but you don't have to use them, which leads me onto...
second. it IS anonymous, as long as you don't buy through an exchange which knows your personal information. Use cash, and you're fine. Cover your tracks, use tor, vpn and don't reveal an IP connected to your real identity and you're fine. Just because some people can't be bothered to take these steps doesn't mean they are not available. Yes, there is the blockchain, but as long as you ensure that there are no ties to your real world identity, you're fine.
third. Who cares if it doesn't fit some guys pet definition of 'currency'?  The fact is, it has widely agreed value, can be exchanged for goods and services, fungible etc etc. It has all the important properties, the rest is academic.
fourth. it DOES have the potential to allow us to break free from taxation. See my point on anonymity. The global black market is estimated at around 1.8 trillion, and this will only increase as crypto's catch on. 
I can't say for sure that it will be bitcoin that opens all these doors, but cryptocurrencies certainly have the potential to do all of the above.

As for your point about devaluation of bitcoins, it's retarded. Do you really not understand that BTC are created according to a regular reward halving?

1. grandma will always struggle, its more about the upcoming generation
2. True, delivery addresses pose a problem, but it's not insoluble. I don't believe its all that hard to cover your tracks online, quite the opposite - There is now a TOR browser bundle that you can download, and use right out of the box. No expertise required. It didn't used to be that easy.
VPN is just a case of sign up and connect, https everywhere is a simple browser plugin.... it's all easy. The real reason people don't use this stuff is because the immediate benefits are not clear. But when bitcoin goods are selling for 20% cheaper than fiat goods due to being tax free, it will suddenly start to get clearer.
3. If deflation is a show stopper, then it follows that the USD was not a currency when it was backed by the gold standard and the price of gold was rising. Is this what you believe? 
4. again, I think the opposite will happen. If there's one thing you can always safely bet on, it's that people will do whatever profits them. When people realise that they can dodge the taxman with minimal risk, they will do it. Just like bittorrent. The niche nerd-hobbies of today are the ubiquitous standards of tomorrow.

The zero marginal cost thing applies to transactions within the bitcoin ecosystem, that's the point. We're looking long term here, to when the bitcoin economy is self contained, where it is accepted widely enough to make exchanges unnecessary. That's what you should judge bitcoin on, not on it's temporary interfacing with fiat.


The reason inflation is low is because these created dollars are held in reserve, and are not yet circulating in the wider economy.

Actually there's nothing hypocritical in that. Analogy: If someone points a gun to your head and demands that you buy a car for $10k, even though it's only worth $1k, what will you do? Obviously pay up, cos you don't want to die, but will you then take the car? Think about it, you've been forced to pay for the car, you might as well have it. Taking the car does *not* mean you approve of the extortion and it does *not* make you a hypocrite. 
Same thing with Rand. No doubt she was taxed by the gov all her life, so she's fully entitled to get what she (over)paid for and *also* to complain about the tax. No hypocrisy in that.
As for the rest of your points, I don't disagree, but from what I've heard (I'm not an expert), it seems that the fallout will be worse if the debt is allowed to rack up even higher, as the bubble will burst sooner or later. You would need to address this theory to be right.

I think a better way to view it is that DPR had only three options: allow the blackmailer to release the info, or pay him off, or kill him. The ideal option - a fair and proportionate punishment for his patently criminal and unjustified extortion - wasn't on the table. 
So which one do you choose? At first glance it seems that paying him off would be reasonable, considering it was DPR's bad security that got him there in the first place. I personally believe this would have happened, if DPR could have been sure it would end there. But how can you be sure? More than likely, the demands would have kept on coming.
Allowing him to release the info wasn't really an option either, as DPR can't put thousands of customers at risk, so I think the contract killing was possibly the least unreasonable option. 
@_date: 2013-11-11 01:10:46
Even when it was under $10, I can't imagine anyone waiting around.

His only argument (despite all the entertaining theatrics) was that Satoshi's style is to dump a brilliant thesis on the world and then walk away, and therefore Satoshi = Mochizuki because he did that with the abc conjecture.  Well, Perelman did that with the Poincare conjecture! In fact there are probably dozens of shy and reclusive geniuses in the world, and you don't have to have made famous contributions to be a potential Satoshi Nakamoto

Hey Randombozo, see this gun? Yeah, I'm pointing it at you, so give me all your money or else. What's that, you don't like this arrangement? What are you, some teenager in the throes of hormonal angst?

Wow, the depth of your research is truly intimidating. I would argue with you, but how can I hope to match your expertise?

Wow. You just blew my mind, I never thought of that. I've been involved for a year now, and had assumed one of the big risks was for the protocol to be broken. Thanks for setting my mind at ease!

This gem from the comments made my day:
Tax authorities 'huff and puff' over everything they don't really understand, in the belief that they have a right to put their hands in everyone's pocket and grab what is there. I have little interest in bitcoins, but a little while back I cut down a neighbour's tree for him and, in return he 'paid' me with a dumper full of horse manure for the garden. This transaction, presumably, avoided my neighbour and I avoid paying tax. I do regret what I did, and I beg forgiveness from HMRC, but I'm quite prepared to send a few shovels of manure to them if the really feel they have a legitimate claim to a share of my labours.

Wow, this is the most retarded thing I've read in a long time.

There's a concept in economics called 'utility of money'. See here: 
Basically, it means that having $10million is great, and having 100 million is better, but not 10 times better, cos by that point you already have most of what you want. So what you should do is choose your personal "nice" amount of money, and make sure you have enough of each alt coin so that if that alt coin succeeds and becomes a world currency, then you're sorted.
example: I would be happy with $2 million. If bitcoin takes off, then it will be worth thousands per coin, so I need about 500 BC. Anymore isn't worth it. So let's say B = 500
If litecoin replaces bitcoin, then each litecoin will be worth a quarter as much (as there are 4 times as many of them), so I would need ~2000 litecoins to have $2 million in the event of litecoin being 'the one'.  So lets say L = 2000
Do this for each altcoin that you care about, and sum up the dollar value of all the coins you would need. Now divide that number into what you can afford, then multiply the resulting fraction by each &lt; B, L, X etc&gt;
That's how many alt coins are enough.
Example, I've worked out that I need 400 BC, 2000 LC, 10000 PPC, etc etc,  to be sure of having $2 million regardless of which one succeeds.  Let's say the total dollar value of that is $40000 (just made that up). But I only have $10000 in total. So, I divide everything by 4. Now I have 100 BC, 500 LC, 2500 PPC etc. That's how many of each coin I should have.
Note: this assumes that the current price of each coin is a fair measure of the probability of that coin being "the one". If you don't think it is a fair measure for a given coin, then change the price and the equation will adjust accordingly.
