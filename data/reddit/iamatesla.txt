I think I saw more hipsters in Ashville than I did in San Francisco.

hahaha fixed again! I'm an electrical engineering student, not an English major :)

Good idea. I'll look into it. Hopefully it'll be up there within the next two days.

Very interesting fuel cell products. I'll take a closer look at them tomorrow. As for charging, there's a cigarette lighter type plug on the SharkBox that is wired directly to the internal battery. We call it an accessory port because it can be used to power any 12v device that normally works in a car. We use this port as the charging port as well. There is an external high power charger with one of these connectors attached (it looks like a laptop charger) that you connect to the port. As for solar, we'll eventually have a system that will recharge the SharkBox, but you can technically use any solar panel that would charge a car battery to charge the SharkBox if you're looking for a DIY solution. A cable will also be included that allows sharkbox to connect to an existing cigarette lighter connector in a car to recharge
as well.
TL;DR many different ways to charge a SharkBox including solar.

Thanks! No USB ports currently, but we include a 12v cigarette lighter USB adapter that can be connected to the accessory port. There will likely be multiple USB ports in the next version. It does weigh around 40lbs, but the version that will be shipped is an improved version that will have wheels on the case.
