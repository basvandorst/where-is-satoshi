Who is going to maintain those robots? Who will program them? Who will ensure self-programming robots don't rebel? Who is going to design better robots? Who is going to command these robots to work? Who is going to decide who gets how many robots in their homes?
The idea that robots will replace 90% of our jobs assumes that there won't be 90% more jobs.

So you think people who don't work will get their food by hunting or farming?
Money is just a facilitator for work transfer, like electricity from a dam to run a fan in your house.

Millions of people? Billions of people earn a dollar a day or less. Cry me a fucking river.

You left out "Father: sociopath who lied, cheated, possibly committed murder and abused the shit out of his wife and children. The primary reason Elon moved to America from South Africa."
Elon absolutely hates his father.

The problem is that Venezuela is where this concept always seems to inevitably lead...
Hell, until Chavez died people talked about Venezuela as being the ideal socialist paradise.

You *really* think those different government bodies and 31% taxation would disappear?

Vacations? Luxuries? Getting paid enough to eat and sleep in an apartment merely for existing IS a vacation and a luxury for many, many people.
Look at how much social security disability is abused.

It's weird how many people don't comprehend that.

Now imagine an order of magnitude more people on the planet. Then imagine another order of magnitude beyond that.
People would rather live in squalor than stop fucking.

Pretty much until resource scarcity vanishes, which will only happen when we're at a technological level to POOF things into existence a la Star Trek.
So... never.

It's not his job to prove your argument. Back up your statements or gtfo.

Yeah, and that's what I'm reluctantly doing too. My only real point originally was that the interest in an alternative shouldn't be underestimated.

Fewer than you think.

Unless you're unlucky enough to send it on the same day they halt trading.
No thanks. If there's an alternative I'm taking it. I trust the blockchain, not third party servers hosted on who knows what and illicitly accessed by who knows who.
I just don't understand how people can be so trusting no more than a few years after an event where a ***billion*** dollars were *stolen*.

Slowly but surely even the resistant ones are succumbing. I remember when there weren't scrypt ASICs. :\

[Teleglitch]( looks like a PS1 game.
