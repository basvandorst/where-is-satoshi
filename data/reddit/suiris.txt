Anyone have a copy of the .zip? I want to use wireshark and see what it's doing. I'm guessing it's going to SSH somewhere based off the "PuTTY" in the shortcut.

Awesome! Ordered one. Like nogodsorkings1, you should have a list of leather/stitch/bracket colors available on the website or bitpay.

Awesome! Thanks. I was worried I was in a pool looking for coins and they'd just cancel my purchase.

Woo! Thanks. I was super nervous about buying in, but profit is profit!

Because they fear that prices will keep dropping, they sell, trying to take what they can, and end up making it worse. It's the selfishness of one person to help the Snowball effect.

Woah! When did this appear?

That's really interesting, I had never heard of it. It looks a little scammy, but that's excellent for the market because now linking a bank account isn't necessary. Thanks for this, as for now this is probably the only way to go from prepaid-&gt;bitcoin in just 1 or 2 leaps.

The bitcoin button takes me to a bitpay 404 page. Bug or bad copy and paste?
