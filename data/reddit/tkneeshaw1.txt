Why did satoshi not make private keys like 300bit or something higher. This would make it exponentially harder. Not saying that 256 isn’t good enough, I’m just wondering why that was the number chosen. If anyone knows I would be grateful to have my curiosity fulfilled

Ask in r/btc this sub will not give you a correct answer. The main answer from my little understanding is blocksize making it easier to have more transactions than bitcoin with lower fees, however bitcoin is The Godfather and will never be overtaken. Bitcoin mining hashrate shadows Bch and bch will never be able to compete with the security of bitcoin.

I don’t make predictions. I know that bitcoin is much more valuable then the current price and that is why I hodl. Nobody can predict this so I stopped with the silly predictions a long time ago. Since there is ~30 million people that hold bitcoin it’s very easy for one to get the right number. Same odds as the lotto. Always one that gets lucky.

Why would a whale holding 1000+ btc not want a million dollar btc? The only reason they cause flash crashes are to short the market and leech extra bitcoin out of the uneducated crypto investor. This is why everyone tells new bitcoiners to hodl instead of getting played by the whales. Yes this market is still manipulated. However it is becoming increasingly hard to manipulate. The bigger the community the less impact a whale will have with selling their bitcoins as the market can better handle it with the liquidity.

Yes he is he stated that if you ever bought bitcoin there is a 98% chance that that you are turning a profit. This is false as more than 2% of all coins were sold and are still being held from the days btc was valued higher. Most people here clearly don’t understand how bitcoin grows in value.
@_date: 2019-06-10 02:25:44

I agree it was pompous for him to say this, however, he is kinda right. I agree his message speaks volumes of his character, however, this is kind of a dumb question. I never had to ask myself, as I had prior understanding of how to read graphs and percentages that led me to determine what that number meant on my own. Someone with a higher iq would most likely never ask this question, however, I think it is useful to double check and always attempt to educate yourself and for that I think this is a wonderful question as there are many people that may need help understanding this. Some people are born to understand this like me and others are creative, which I am not lol. Moral is don’t be a dick like that dude, however, he isn’t wrong.
@_date: 2019-06-23 17:43:00
Exactly he doesn’t understand
@_date: 2019-06-23 13:06:34
Dude you act like you know everything. Instead of helping to educate this person about bitcoin, which we want to spread adoption, you decide to degrade him as it makes you feel like you have a bigger dick. How bout you learn how to tell people they have no idea what they are talking about with a simple answer explaining pairing currencies. This is not a common concept for many people in the world as they have only ever known 1 currency. In the interest of a better population of humans who actually understand how to communicate effectively and kindly, I ask you to Ef off because you are the idiot that only knows how to spread hateful messages to people you don’t know. Btc facilitates better communication between people, you create worse communication. You literally are working against bitcoin with your comments.
@_date: 2019-06-23 17:39:32
Seriously you must be dumb. You do not see the point I’m making. You are right it isn’t the same point. My point is that he is misleading dumb people like you into believing their position in bitcoin isn’t as risky as it is.

You are a fucking moron. It’s people like this that actually further btc unlike stupid fudders like you
@_date: 2019-06-23 13:14:07
Bro those are just measurements of value. What you aren’t understanding is eth has value. Now when you look at these measurements you compare the value of eth with the value of the other. So as you believe btc is better than eth and going to keep increasing In value faster than eth than I wouldn’t sell bitcoin for eth, however, eth could easily rise quicker than btc and you could sell your 1 eth for like .1 btc rather than .03 for an example.
@_date: 2019-06-23 17:45:04
Pretty sure no one with 0 btc would waste their time on this reddit page
@_date: 2019-06-23 13:10:02
Sorry this dude is a dick. So to answer your question, if you bought eth at the same sats each time then you have not increased in value in reference to bitcoin, however, since you bought I would assume eth has gone up about 50% in dollar value. So you are gaining money against the dollar and holding the same value you could have traded your eth for bitcoin. If it goes way up then you can sell eth for a lot more bitcoin. Good luck man always ask questions like this before trading. IMO you are the smart trader.
@_date: 2019-06-23 13:17:44
This is the golden question that nobody knows. Some are bitcoin maximalists believing only btc will exist in the future and others believing they will coexist. Eth even has a number of people that believe in the flippening meaning it will overtake bitcoin for number 1. The best you can do is diversify your portfolio. I personally like btc eth ltc and my favorite is stellar.

@_date: 2019-06-23 12:36:45
Actually you are wrong. The graph shows the number of days that were profitable not the number of people. Since the volume was higher on the days that were unprofitable I guarantee that it is much less than 98% of people who bought are in profit.
@_date: 2019-06-02 23:18:11

@_date: 2019-06-15 12:49:58
Bro an acre sells for over 1000 dollars. He also only took into account habitable land, excluding desserts and mountains, which would have a lot of value. The other thing you forget is that btc supply can be choked raising the value of btc. It is all supply and demand. Just imagine if the banks suddenly bought half of all the land and no one could live on it. That would make all the other land for sale a shit load more expensive

How can I view this real time? I bet even more were just liquidated.
@_date: 2019-06-23 16:11:44
In order for his statement to be true he would have to total the number of btc sold below the current value vs the total number sold above the current value. The number of bitcoins sold during a day is not equal. The number of bitcoins bought on the day bitcoin hit 20000 is hundred of times if not thousands of times higher than any given day in 2010.

If I’m reading this correctly [bitcoin addresses]( only ~700,000 addresses have 1 btc or more. So you are in the million club at least. There actually isn’t even 21 million addresses worth 1 dollar. 16.5 million btc belong to people that own 10 or more. That leaves only about 1 million btc for the little people like me!

I hate when people say this... the whole point In cryptocurrency is adoption. Bitcoin spread all over the media will cause a massive boost... this is very good. As a result many people like me will see massive gains and want to capitalize on that. We will pull part of our money out and wait for it to drop a good 60% this is also good because we will capitalize on the fomo as we are not noobs. Then we will make a shit ton more as adoption continues to grow during the next bull market. None of that is bad. What is bad is when you are to dumb to make positive trades.

Wrong just because a proved b to be one way does not mean that b proves a in the exact same way lol this thinking is completely flawed.

Well in my opinion bitcoin is a greater invention than amazon and Microsoft combined.

Isn’t this the same as fiat? Or more like a stable coin because there is no way that a person can trust that it is loaded with the btc when you trade it. The point in btc is it establishes the trust in a trade... this defeats that purpose.

Plus with current technology and spread of information/education that s curve should be much quicker than it would have been in the past.

Am I crazy to think that this is going to explode a lot quicker than everyone else thinks? I mean I compare it to cell phones and how quickly they advanced. When they first came out you had to pay for each text and typing texts was a pain. Now texting is vital to our society and I am even typing this with my phone. They say btc has a problem scaling... well people said that about texting and it booked in shorter than a decade. Couldn’t btc hit global adoption well before the next 5 years.
