You must of course know that those kind of gains are not sustainable in the same way that interest from a bank account is

Sometimes I feel like everyone in this sub bought at the all time high
@_date: 2018-04-03 02:39:10

Of course chances are it will be lower but no one knows for sure
@_date: 2018-04-11 00:06:04
Yeah there seems to be a lot of denial
