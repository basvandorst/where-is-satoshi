First of all, Bitcoin has never been hacked. 
You are never meant to store your bitcoin on exchanges. Here’s an Infographic you need to look at:

We’ve been doing this for years now, at Arcift Technologies we prefer to be paid in bitcoin. If someone really don’t wanna pay in bitcoin then we go towards other payment methods.

Having a bank account doesn't mean you have access to banking, people have bank accounts but they are not welcome to other banking services, can you purchase Japanese Stock from US if you from your bank account? 
So only 1.5B people have access to banking + financial services. Other 6B are unbanked. Bitcoin promises all those to provide them full banking services, having a bitcoin wallet doesn't mean you can send/receive a bitcoin transaction. That means you are a bank yourself, soon you'd be able to do everything an accredited investor can with your bitcoin wallet, worldwide, anonymously, securely and without any censorship. That is the real meaning of being banked.
@_date: 2019-08-06 16:27:55

First men made those marks on cryptography forum.
@_date: 2019-08-06 17:54:57
It wasn't like that before until after 2017 bull run. They are just making it hard for people to use crypto services. But they really can't. No one can! 
They can only regulate exchanges, not all of them. People would stop using exchanges because they no longer need em in the future when there's no fiat left and everything is tokenzied.
The recommended way of using bitcoin is to run a full node and sign your transactions via that node. And that way no one can censor you.

That’s where probability comes in, ratio of people paying full interest on time is very less. And banks know that better than you. They also know how to fuck people so they’re unable to return their debts, so we take control of their real assets. 
Moral: they have just purchased real-assets with their shit fiat paper money that has no value.

Don’t tell her, start a side business. Maybe your own marketing company or something else. Start investing those funds slowly and build the business as it goes.
You need to be like investing from your earnings. And this way, lets say in 5-10 years. You’d have a profile, business is recognized and most importantly you’d also be getting gains from future bitcoin price upgrades. After all, cashing it out all at once doesn’t seems right. Highly not recommended.
Important thing is to train yourself and your partner to handle all that, people who win the lotteries can’t handle because they were never prepared to that. You need to train yourself, you are a millionaire, try to be one, actually.

When it becomes the mainstream, you won't be converting it to $$ anymore. So no inflation. It'd more likely to be a store of value so you get the value back by paying in BTC.

You are right, but it's just a start for whole new type of finance industry. So I think, in start it's always going to be like that.
People do not care about normal things in this era, so there needs to be something special &amp; more of their interest. Most people are not thinkers and they don't give a shit about what is going to be in future or our next generation.
Only the thinkers &amp; change makers can make it happen. Money is the value you earn by working hard and you deposit it to banks to take benefit from that easy? How foolish are we? They control all that supply and have power. And most importantly they put check on us. This is going to change very soon...

The biggest enemy of bitcoin is the very people who use it but do not hold their private keys. And the people who prefer fiat over bitcoin.
Governments - can’t destroy bitcoin in any way, bitcoin would always win the long term game.
Banks - can’t do anything other than spreading FUD.
Others (you name it) - show me if they can alter a single bitcoin transaction?
