I love how the Asian guy just leans against the rail like, "Yeah, okay, I'll watch this for a sec." Totally would be my response in this situation, too.
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:21:08
Yeah, but you're gonna get reminded like two weeks before 2041. Like a slap in the face by your past self.

Oh boy oh boy, when can I offload all this Bcash into that? This is the next big coin. ��

I've got the same brand but with the cashier keys and G keys. Use them pretty regularly, but I gotta say, that slim keyboard seems super nice. Have you had experience with both? Opinions?

Lack of support is a problem.
@_date: 2017-05-27 03:57:03
Well shit. I guess I'll scramble to get something together, thanks again.
@_date: 2017-05-27 02:48:51
Okay, sweet. Thanks for the help, man. All this attention and volatility has spooked me a bit, so I appreciate having a little more understanding.

If it isn't, the successor will be compared to BTC before and after it's command of the market, so you'll have time to trade around.
@_date: 2017-05-27 02:30:31
Okay, so this kinda makes sense. So does this mean I need to get my coins into a hardware wallet by then to keep from having them divided onto these two networks?
@_date: 2017-05-28 00:02:17
68.2%?

I can't wait to lose a ton of Bitcoin to a brand new boating accident.
@_date: 2017-05-21 11:48:12
I actually got on board with shift for this. Between coinbase and shift, I can put a little in the vault, a little in the wallet, and use a card as per usual for BTC when I feel like it.

I'm wading through all this now as a coinbase user. Should I be doing this as well or just contact Coinbase to see what needs to be done?
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:47:57
Huh. That doesn't seem unreasonable. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-05-26 03:57:12
I love this, but needs BTC symbol on the frisbee.
@_date: 2017-05-26 10:11:42
Testing the waters through coinbase right now, but I'm looking into other ways to store my BTC. Any recommendations for something I can physically hold, or is it getting to the point where it's more reasonable to go through an exchange?
@_date: 2017-05-30 20:06:58
That is a smart-ass kid.
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:34:40
Paper wallets terrify me. I'm super into the keepkey and trezor though. Is there any real reason not to go this route? I'm honestly just tired of dealing with coinbase.
@_date: 2017-05-19 13:35:04
That is going to be a in an economics textbook with a caption ribbing the naysayers of cryptocurrencies versus early adopters.

Of all the time I've mined Bitcoin, about half of it was spent on a sailboat pulling solar and wind.
STEP IT UP

I'm just a dude looking to build up a savings with BTC. I understand some absolute basics about it, but nothing about all these hot button words like SegWit and BIP148 yet. Is there a place to get a walkthrough for it?
@_date: 2017-05-26 02:34:44
@_date: 2017-05-22 19:36:13
I'm treating mine like an alternate savings account. A percent of my income is taken and split 50/50 into savings and BTC. I'm already so up from holding so long, the absolute worst case scenario is that I sell out at with profit and put it into my savings account. My hope is that BTC ends up as my retirement.

Simply because humans make errors. Ever typed a password wrong? Why risk not testing code when you could just test it?
@_date: 2017-06-03 11:46:27
When it comes to other people's money, you ALWAYS test, check, and double check.  
@_date: 2017-06-15 12:07:52
Well, I'm out then. I won't be dealing in crypto currency anymore. If these laws end up going into effect, I will be closing my accounts and tossing the hardware I potentially have to hold said currency. I might still come around to ask about how things are going, but as for me, there's no chance I'm gonna deal with all this.
