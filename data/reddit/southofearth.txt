They only like to buy at the top when its already too late then cry about on the next dip. People read it on here all the time but unless you have the skillset of a day trader and the patience of Buddha the term "buy the dip" doesnt really register with most.

I like all the salty people coming here asking dumb questions about bubbles and value and what can bitcoin do that money cant, blah blah blah. PSA: Do you really think we are going to spend time convincing a total stranger of the value of this new technology and its use cases when you are too lazy to do any basic research yourself so that you can reap the rewards later the same as those who put in the time to understand this? This goes for everyone who posts like this on here or comes from r/all looking to defend what they gullibly get fed on mainstream media.

Its not hackable but the exchange its on is. Its why you buy crypto and move it to a safe hardware wallet. No one smart keeps crypto on their computer. And those who keep it on an exchange for trading are (hopefully) aware of the risk and factor it in.

You missed the point. Dogs give birth to dogs. Each dog has a mother. Animals are not lesser than humans. We all feel pain and have cognitive brains. You cant own a human but we used to - it was called "slavery" and it still exists today for animals. Pets are not lifeless accessories, they are sentient beings. The only reason you view a pet as "owning" one rather than befriending one is that modern slavery still exists for all non-human animals.

This is a poor person's misconception. The rich dont have tax loopholes with capital gains tax, most of the tax savings are business related. The incentive to create business and thus jobs is the lower tax. Any poor person can do this too. But people like you prefer to sit on your ass and get a hand out from the government. Corrupt countries like Zimbabwe and Venezuela dont care about you. They wont use taxes to build roads or schools or whatever bullshit delusion you have. They keep it for themselves, transfer it to offshore accounts, and make their friends rich. Thats why when you go to these countries you can see first hand what poor infrastructure exists there. The rich also often dont use public healthcare or public schools so saying they are using up your resources makes no sense.

Lets say they do need bitcoin for capital flight. My question is - Why announce it to the whole world?
@_date: 2019-03-29 13:00:04
Selective data bias. There were few use cases for it when bitcoin was invented in 2009 and the price/development trajectory has been on an uprise since. If you read historical data from the past few ATH's you will clearly see people were calling that it would never happen again /never reach $30, $200, $1000 again. They were all wrong. So what makes you right with the exact same sentiment? Your one example is Venezuela and so selective data bias doesnt work. We can all cherry pick good times and bad. When you zoom out and see the big picture things become more clear.
@_date: 2019-11-08 04:16:51
All good points but the only thing is that bitcoin cant be "removed" as you say. Even if you block all the websites and apps and turn off all the power, they cant do that for the whole world. There will always be someone out there running nodes, generating power via solar or wind in their small off grid house. Heck we might even see a node running 24/7 in space someday. Anything is possible but stopping bitcoin would be almost no chance. There is talk of quantum computers or 51% attack but where one might fail others will take its place should that ever occur.
@_date: 2019-11-04 11:16:53
My money is in both super safe real estate and super risky crypto. Right now everything I save I save in crypto, there is no point in keeping anything at the bank only to have them lock up shop during next recession. You are not crazy or retarded, and the time to take risks is when you are young as you can always fall back on a boring job if things dont turn out, as many have pointed out. A lot of us can afford to take the risk on this exciting new currency, it could potentially be world changing. Even without massive gains, it already outperforms regular banking by far in speed and security. If nothing came of it and it remained a niche method of transacting between a few, it is still valuable. The thing is is that it could potentially be so much more valuable and reaching every corner of the globe, to lift many out of poverty, give direct aid without the middle man, invest in good startups and fund good projects that are making a difference. Not to mention prevent capital flight and overall mismanagement of the economy by corrupt state leaders. All of this has so much potential. Others like your family may not know it now, but in 10-20 years they will.

No, no one will come out and say suddenly 'cash is dead'. It will be gradual. Kind of like sitting in a pot that is getting warmer over the fire. You wont know youre dead until the last moment. Same with crypto adoption. A switch will happen when suddenly the people who pay with crypto outnumber the people pay with cash. Probably the Romans thought gold would be money forever too, until their emperor devalued it into oblivion by melting it with copper. Same thing today you just arent seeing it or don't know how fractional reserve lending works.
@_date: 2019-11-08 04:01:48
No, banks are not there to "keep your money safe". They are whom you lend YOUR money out to at a small interest rate of 1% (3% at best) and they in turn use your money to make more money for themselves. Should they ever make so many risky decisions that they forclose and need to get bailed out, YOU wont be getting any of your money back, because its not yours, its theirs. You lent it to them.

The mainstream media tries very hard to keep bitcoin in the fringes and thats a good point. Look how mant people theyve brainwashed into saving instead of investing. It may take a long time but eventually the average person will see value in crypto over traditional banking. The more control banks and governments try to peddle (now with creating their own coins since they figure out they can track all of us via blockchain and probably make money selling our spending habits), the more people will turn to being their own bank.

Cash back is a scam , its priced into the items that you buy and also the fees ayou pay for using a credit card far outweigh anything you earned. Sorry you fell for it.

You could also paste an address QR sticker on it for easy deposits. If something like this existed, with a value dispay and in kid friendly colors/shapes I would definitely buy it. Imagine how easy it would be to send btc to anyone in the world and say its their bday or xmas and they wake up to see the value on the display increase. If you have the know-how to create this you should crowdfund and get it running.

Yes I really dont understand why most of the comments are "if you bought 2 years ago in Dec 2017 you'd be down". Right? But we didnt all fomo in at the ATH, so some of us are up. Lots of salty comments that make no sense. Also gold being around longer doesnt make the fact that bitcoin has had better returns in the last 10 years than gold in the last 100.

Why? Youre not going to make any serious money in the next bullrun if youre only holding bitcoin. Also, the top price in your chart is btc/usd and all subsequent are against /btc. Of course when btc is up others are down if measured against it. Go learn some basic math or something.

No, not just trading. There is risk with just holding bitcoin. You seem to think risk is all or nothing. There are different degrees of risk.

Most people buy and hold until they are ready to cash out. Look up how the bitcoin market cycle works. If you want to day trade you will need to move your coins to Coinbase Pro or Binance. There will always be fees when buying and selling, this is how these platforms make money. Even if the fee is not obvious on other exchanges it is often priced into the value of the coin (this is called the spread).

Its permissionless, thus we are not sitting around waiting for an A-okay from govt, nor do we need one. They cant shut it down. They cant take it away. Its peer to peer and you can transact with anyone in the world. You can also hold onto it as a safe hedge from government inflated fiat currency.

Lol trading with $3? Dont bother. Or at least learn what youre doing first. You are going to be waiting a long time to 3x your money (21k btc) so that your $3 becomes $9 and you can pay $3 to cash out. You will have $0 long before then.

In crypto you are your own bank. So if you can not keep track of important things such as passwords, private keys or recovery words then bitcoin is not for you. If you dont do your research first you wont be able to keep your funds safe and no bank will bail you out as thats not a thing here.
@_date: 2019-04-06 05:20:20
If you want to compare, in 10 years of time bitcoin went from $0 to $5k all the while the dollar was depreciating in value, albeit more slowly. Multiply this kind of return by 10 to get 100 years and a true comparison.

Taking a sample of 6 months out of a 9 year period is called "cherry picking your data". Look it up. When you zoom out and see bitcoin gain thousands of % over the span since its creation its nothing compared to the 4.5% yearly average a property appreciates. Also, I already own multiple properties which balances my risk anyway.
@_date: 2018-11-28 08:15:44

Crypto is more than cryptography. Its a ledger run without central authority. Maybe the cryptography created for specific purposes needs rules (aka regulation, as this is what the ad means) because it serves a purpose of power, secrecy, and cobtrol for someone who created it. But crypto like bitcoin is the opposite. Of course, all cryptocurrencies are not equal.
@_date: 2019-01-09 16:43:03
It clearly says "regulated" in highlight at the bottom so its not up to interpretation what kind of rules they meant. 
@_date: 2019-01-31 07:36:21
The 1% stealing from the 99% should very much be their concern. Its modern slavery. You can say the 99% can get rich but its easy to make money for those who already have it. Their shady backhand deals and them rigging the system by baking those in power is the issue. Wealth is a zero sum game. Those who are good at stealing it and oppressing others are morally wrong. It has nothing to do with handouts. And it also has nothing to do with "working hard" or whatever other delusional ways you think someone in poverty can just magically get rich.

No. Exchanges go under all the time and dont return funds. I dont see how a buggy update on a phone would be any different. Unless they make the wallet on the phone fully decentralized, the users wont have their own keys, thus wont be able to restore the wallet elsewhere should anything weird happen.

There doesn't have to be complete economic equality (and such a system fails as it punishes the entrepreneurs and anyone advancing knowledge/creativity), but what would be nice is if those already living on this planet weren't left to spend life stressing about finances. You have a point about adapting though. Since the world is constantly changing and the people in it are vastly different there is of course no single perfect system. That is good because if any particular system was attacked or failed on its own, others will survive.

It definitely would speed up inflation to some degree. A good and a bad thing. Bad for obvious reasons and good because most people dont know how the system works and just under how much control they are. Banks and mainstream media are fiat pushers. They tell everyone to save save save. Meaning: Leave your fiat with us and we profit from it and also you will be the last to get bailed out once another econ crisis hits the fan. As with data and facebook, the customer is the product. They can print more, and do, but the jig will be up, leading most to park their money in safe investments like crypto, real estate, and gold.

It will because it was created precisely FOR the banks and the banks like to make profit, so they will guarantee its adoption. The main reason is for fast transactions, because that is the advantage of the blockchain. It doesnt mean they will let people hold XRP, but it may mean it gets automatically converted to fiat the moment it is sent/received.

I am sure there are ways to cash out the btc. Its too bad the govt controls identities and identities are tied to borders. I can see this putting a real damper on things in 5-10 years when btc is legal is some countries but not in others.
@_date: 2017-09-17 05:56:39
Wouldnt work. First, you cant reverse the transaction on the blockchain nor can you order anyone to do so because you dont control their provate keys the way Amazon or Paypal just control your payment method. Second, you cant force bitcoin users to reveal their identity. The whole point is that third parties dont have this control and you control your own money/choices. If you get scammed - thats on you.
@_date: 2017-10-12 19:09:53
You will always have to pay a fee to move BTC because that is what you pay to the miners to get your transaction verified on the blockchain. As for where to keep coins pre-fork: No one really has any clear info right now. We are all waiting for each exchange/soft wallet to make their own announcements regarding B2X.

For many early investors the wins far outweigh the losses. It is kind of a rush to live in the time when all of this is just getting started. I am glad, even if it fails, that I am not sitting on the sidelines. This is definitely the first steps in what is going to be a huge game changer and bring us into the future. Whether that future is controlled by the individual or the central bank (through govt) remains to be seen. It could all go very badly. Much like the atomic bomb. At the time the science behind splitting an atom was revolutionary for its day but the end use became devastating. This could end up the same way, but it is up to us. Up to those who believe in the tech, and not just speculate on price.

@_date: 2018-02-08 00:51:20
We haven't even scratched the surface yet with the amount of new incomers cryptocurrencies can have. December 2017 was just a small fraction. Sure, it was on the news, but adoption is nowhere near what will be in the future yet. And when in 20 years crypto payments are the norm, the money from fiat investments like stocks and gold/silver will greatly sway the balance and affect price. Not to mention bitcoin halvenings, free crypto from more forks, etc etc.

Yes, this is likely. Russia is already implementing their own crypto currency and many nations will follow if they are smart. If btc or another crypto doesnt become mainstream by the time this happens it will be very easy for govts to make it illegal and force the adoption of a govt backed crypto. Instead of decentralization, crypto will now be used for even tighter control.
@_date: 2017-09-13 06:26:01

They cant ban P2P bitcoin transfers but they can ban exchanges as China did, making it impossible to buy/sell crypto with fiat. Unless goods and services will accept crypto by that point, the impact would be a decrease in price to some degree.

Not sure about this. I only downloaded Mycelium once to see the UI and to keep it for playing with next time I am at the btc atm here. I dont plan on spending any crypto anytime soon, which is essentially what a wallet is for, because the price keeps rising so its a good investment to hold. In the future when crypto prices stabilize the wallets will have a bigger role.

They live in poverty because someone else (banks/govt) controls their currency and inflates it at will. Once they control their own money they can be secure from this.

@_date: 2017-10-12 19:02:48
Store as much on Coinbase as you're willing to lose. Ideally you should store at least in a secure wallet with 2FA protection (you can google some options like Mycelium, Jaxx, Breadwallet - read reviews for each and decide) or in a paper/hard wallet. And no, you will always pay fees when you buy, sell, trade, or send BTC.

The fees on Coinbase are quite high but Bitfinex wont give you the option to buy with a credit card, or even deposit USD anymore. I stopped using Coinbase a while ago due to high fees but it is more convenient if you have fiat to exchange. Neither are safe for long term holding but Bitfinex had 2FA at least.

I see a lot of people misuse this term. Here is what it means.
"an economic and political system in which a country's trade and industry are controlled by private owners for profit, rather than by the state"
Whats actually happening here is a corrupt state controlled money printing, which is not new but just increasing in scale. They say they do it to keep "the system" going but in reality its for their crook friends in the financial/political sphreres. This is called "statism":
"The term "statism" is sometimes used to refer to market economies with large amounts of government intervention, regulation or influence over a market or mixed-market economy"

 Or, due to the lack of replay protection, bitcoin owners will have to choose core or 2x?
Additionally, if the latter is true, what popular wallets support the core coin? I currently use Electrum, but I don't know where they stand on the issue.
You will have to check each ones websites for their stance. 
Also, on an unrelated note, my minimum fee on Electrum is still .5 mBTC while other people are getting tiny fees using other wallets :( 
Is there anything I can do to lower these fees? 
You can switch to a different wallet.

@_date: 2017-10-12 19:46:53
By segwit chain do you mean you have it in original BTC? I would check for an announcement from Ledger Nano for confirmation of their stance and how to safely move coins before/after the fork. The new chain won't have replay protection so an extra step is needed so that you dont lose coins / accidentally move everything to B2X chain unknowingly.

@_date: 2019-09-28 13:40:10
This is a bit miselading hence all the bitter comments here. Bitcoin actually is being inflated, as in more bitcoin is being released via mining for everyone to use every block that is mined. However, the value of bitcoin has gone up an average of 1000% a year for the past 10 years, thus its relative purchasing power is increasing. This of course is most obvious with the 10,000 btc pizza example. Not accounting for other complications like adoption and coin burn.

All you need to do to be able to trade something for another thing is agree on the value of the two items. If I like your goat and you like my glass beads we trade. Same with bitcoin. If I like this house and need somewhere to live but you are rich and looking to move to a better house plus you think bitcoin will rise in value in 10 years then we trade. I may also think it will rise in 10 years but I need a place to live. Purchases are driven by needs and value and speculation is one of the reasons too. Also, when you  make purchase in btc you may do it because its the fastest option or it lets you pay anyone in the world. There is nothing stopping you from purchasing more btc right after you send your payment if you believe the exchange rate is good. Eventually when the last coin is mined the price will level out and it wont have these crazy swings.

Yeah I saw something like this in etsy where they were selling the bags made out of money. I am not sure how many people took any cash with them when leaving Venezuela. It is hard to figure out how to get btc directly to those who need it since there could be many donation sites who are just taking advantage of the situation and keeping all profits. Thatnk you for your thoughts on this.
