Can you sell on coinbase now in the UK? It used to be only for buying.

I sold some, kept some. Whatever happens, I've made profit. If it goes up again, I've made some more.

I'm in no rush

I'd say 99/100 ATMs that I come across are free. You do get those non-free ones at corner shops, but I don't think anyone ever uses them unless they're drunk.

I've had some gigs that have paid using bitcoin. I held onto it because nothing I spend money on accepts BTC.

I feel like Americans have a skewed view on the convenience of bitcoin compared to banks. In the UK (possibly Europe in general?) you can send a bank transfer at any time of the day or night, for free, and it goes through in less than a minute. That's been the standard for so many years I was shocked to learn Americans pay fees for banking. Here accounts are free, ATMs are free, transfers are free. The only thing not free is borrowing money.

Is there an equivalent chart for selling?

It's pretty slow. If I send money from one UK bank account to another, or from PayPal to my bank account, it arrives in less than a minute. Bitcoin can take hours to confirm, particularly if the network is busy.

I remember getting excited when it hit $1,000

Wow, that's appalling. Here all consumer bank accounts are free (unless it's a special account with perks like travel insurance), all transfers are free and instant, and can be done at any time. Converting into physical cash via an ATM is also free and if you're in a city it's rare to be more than five minutes walk from one. I don't know how BTC can compete with that. The first layer second layer thing isn't relevant to most people. They won't care about that as long as BTC is more expensive and slower than using a bank.

Sure, I don't trust PayPal either. That's why I move money out of it immediately every time I get paid (I've been working full time online since 2010).
Within the last hour I've wired money from PayPal to my bank account. At 6am. It showed up in my bank account 8 seconds later. That's the amount of time transfers usually take between banks too. You can do them at 2am on Christmas Day if you want, still goes through instantly.
The situation you describe sounds like what we had in the UK 20 years ago. Is it really still so slow to move money around where you are? Must be outside the EU? Do you not have Faster Payments yet? I'm 32 and can vaguely remember a time when bank transfers weren't instant, but for the last decade or so there's been no delay. They're free too, unlike BTC transfers which have a fee.
I own BTC because a client paid me with it in 2012 and when I looked into it, it was too expensive and time-consuming to transfer it to GBP. Given how it's gone up in value, I'm glad I kept it, but BTC as a currency is hopeless unless it can match the instant fee-free transfers banks currently offer 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

It's my PayPal account and my own bank account. I could send it back but I don't think PayPal is allowed to recall it.
With a bank transfer, once it's gone it's gone. There's been a lot of stories in the news lately about how we need more checks to ensure the name on a bank account matches what the sender thinks they're sending to, because apparently thousands of people send to the wrong account and there's nothing that can be done about it.

What's a good software wallet?
