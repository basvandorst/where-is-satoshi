 is built by co-founders of NEO. It's a decentralized search framework using their Nebulas Rank (NR) algorithm to search ANY blockchain through smart contracts, dapps, addresses, etc. and rank them based on 3 main factors. The cofounders of NEO were also ex anti-spam employees at google, helping prevent black hat SEO tactics so they have the knowledge and experience.

He works at the cafe

I've been to here, it's a bitcoin themed cafe but they do not accept bitcoin (because of Vietnamese law). It's on the walking street tons of bars and craziness happens every night.

Yes there is an Bitcoin ATM upstairs, but you cannot pay at the cafe in Bitcoin. The place is called "Bitcoin Bar" or "Bitcoin Cafe" and have bitcoin signs and balloons inside.

Why'd you leave?
@_date: 2014-06-16 23:12:36
Oh yeah man I can see where you're coming from. Good luck with your ventures!

By future girlfriend I mean myself.

I think of LTC as a testbed for future BTC updates. Gives validation to new things (ex: Segwit, Lightning Network, etc.)
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:44:39
Sweet! Where can I get some for my future girlfriend?
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:35:50
I like those stickers!

There's already BCC (BitConnect Coin) -- does it matter?
@_date: 2018-12-28 21:41:34
Not my app. Just thought it was an interesting utilization of LN
@_date: 2018-12-28 21:40:45
I don't think the questions are decentralized like augur so do not think that will be an issue.

My friend said he'd sell me a funded 0.5 btc silver casascius for $750.. good deal?
@_date: 2013-11-20 04:49:36
...it's been like one day, try waiting a month and see where we're at.
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:06:57
It's up to you. Whether you can afford to lose $660 x 5 or not. I personally am waiting for a dip.. but I don't know much about the BTC market and am by no means an expert. My friend just told me it's trading at $770 in China so it could be a go.
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:10:40
So you bought two at 660 a piece? Good luck!
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:21:29
Yeah. I'm trying to decide if I should buy more right now. Stupid brain.
@_date: 2013-12-03 03:50:51
We're all hoping so.
@_date: 2013-12-14 05:07:22
I think they film 5 episodes every Monday. Not positive.
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:25:04
It's okay. There's only one way for it to go. Up!
@_date: 2013-12-03 03:53:48
It's not a fad. China is investing, along with the rest of the world. Bitcoin is here to stay.
@_date: 2013-11-20 04:52:54
$550 seems like a fair price to me at the current rate.
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:49:19
Luckily I have a friend with $30k in coins who will sell me some of his. I bought in today with $150 for 0.25 ...I really want to buy more though.. :\

Send it to Electrum and talk to a lawyer.
