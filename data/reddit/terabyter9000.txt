As I posted in my own reply, I too wanted to invest $2500 CAD into this currency back in January 2013 or so. Would be so much better off. Ah well. Litecoin FTW.

LOL you think that's tough? I tried to buy Bitcoins earlier this year when they were in the $20 USD range, and had the same problems. Either had to be a U.S. citizen or had bullshit verification to go though, I gave up. Now I'm looking at $1000 bitcoins going WHAT THE FUCK. I was ready to spend about $2500 to get some bitcoins and would now have something like $150,000 worth (bought silver coins instead and silver promptly tanked). What a fucking complicated thing to get your hands on. Still is. I've now turned to Litecoin as my savior. Got the client, mining as I type this, plus I plan on purchasing some soonish. Hopefully it's a easier to buy them.

I'd tip you a beer for that but have yet to get in on the action. Fixing that this week.

Well there always is CraftCoins, based on Minecraft. Check out their site. They go for $0.70 each. Mining still available (not pre-mined like Quark).

Omg imagine a server where you can trade in different ores for different amounts of bitcoins. Diamond gives 0.001, Gold gives 0.0001 etc

If Peter Schiff were smart, he'd start his own digital currency called SchiffCoins and get his viewers / listeners on the band wagon. What you resist, persists.

Hmm I'd rather be able to trade in my 500k wowgold for bitcoins instead. (Turalyon-A US btw)
