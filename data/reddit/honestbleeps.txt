This is one of the few advantages that a non-anonymous service like PayPal has, not that I'm advocating we all go get happy about PayPal.
I can count on 1 hand the number of times a month someone sends in a donation for RES in a given month. However, once or twice a year, someone will send $50 instead of the usual $1 or $2 or $5.
I've emailed each person back (because I have their contact info) to ask if it was a typo, as I don't want to benefit from a mistake like that, and I actually have the ability to ask.
I did get one reply saying it was a typo out of the few (5 or 6 over the course of a few years) who never replied back to me. I was happy to send the money back.
I guess if it looked like a bitcoin accident, I'd just... send a chunk of it back and see if it gets kicked back to me again?  I'm not even sure what I'd do.

Well no. This implies that all the poker sites were scamming users. Most weren't.  Black Friday didn't bring any issues "to light", really.  It just caused a shitstorm of locked down money and people waiting/hoping/praying they'd get theirs back.  Many got nothing. More got &lt;100% of what they were owed.

Dagny Taggart as an example person in the list view of your phone app is not something I think is a good idea. Neither are the drug references.
A big reason Bitcoin has "controversy" and drama around it is the polarizing political stuff. Using a character like that (for those unaware, it's from Ayn Rand's "Atlas Shrugged") and dropping drug references in there only serves to fuel the fire and make BTC into a political thing, rather than a decentralized currency, etc.
Just my 2 cents.

If I'm reading the wording of this job posting correctly, the CTO's job description involves both design and implementation (e.g. web development).
It's hard enough to find someone who has chops on both the design side *and* the development side... but a CTO's job description usually involves big picture stuff and managing the people who would do that work (and the processes that affect them) - not actually doing it.
You've also got this same person responsible for security... so you want a full stack developer who can also do design... AND knows security?  Is the CTO role still a management role like it traditionally is, too?
I'm genuinely confused by the job title vs. description disparity...


10 BTC? so as of today like $6500 for 20-30 hours a week... for how many weeks? Are you paying 10BTC/month? 10BTC/year?
I'm going to assume 10BTC/month because otherwise we're talkin' crazy talk.
Let's say 25 hours a week for a month - 100 hours... that's $65/hour plus equity. That's "OK" pay, though maybe not for someone living in California, unless that equity is immediately translatable to some sort of payout?

so your app is HTML/CSS/JS, yeah? I'm curious what framework(s) you're using, etc... 


Ehhhh, this was really Steve Jobs just hating on Flash.
It's not in Apple's best interests for HTML5 apps to become true 100% first class citizens, because they make a metric crapton of money via their 30% cut of everything that goes through the app store.
At the very least, they'll want you packaging with Phonegap/Cordova (oh crap, Adobe tools!) or some similar alternative so you still have to go through their revenue model/stream.
They've done very little to indicate they are "all in" on HTML5 as a true app development platform in my opinion. Mostly they touted HTML5 as something to shout about in their desire to kill Flash (for varying reasons ranging from security and/or performance issues to the lack of revenue streams if fun casual games can be had for free on kongregate instead of itunes)...

this is really it more than anything I think.
I'm interested in seeing it used more, but **for now**, nobody can really give me a great reason why I should spend bitcoin instead of USD when I buy something.  They say "spend BTC to promote the use of BTC!" - but there's nothing in that for me.
Will there be? Yes, if:
- we get to a point where merchant benefit justifies a discount for people who spend using BTC, thus consumer benefit
- we need to buy from a place that couldn't accept USD (but not for legal reasons, rather cost reasons like foreign transaction fees, etc) - resulting in a consumer benefit of availability of product from overseas, etc, that wouldn't have otherwise been available
Beyond that, I'm not convinced there's much other (average joe) consumer benefit that'll be here in the near future. Most people don't care about the potential anonymity (and it's only potential), or the whole "not controlled by a central authority" thing, either.
I hope I'm proven wrong, I'd like to see something cheaper/safer to transfer than USD. Even microtransaction fees are a bit much imo.
@_date: 2014-03-04 16:53:04
fair enough, but I'd say I feel it warrants its own title then. It's not the same job at all.

If what you're saying is all true - the legal documents should go up online for all to see. So should the video.
From there, maybe you can get the support of an organization that seeks to fight these battles as a means of bettering the system. 
I don't want to be presumptuous here, but maybe an organization like [the ACLU]( would even step in.

BitPay allows you to decide on a % that will go to fiat and/or BTC. I'm not sure how much he's choosing to keep as BTC.
Speaking only on behalf of myself here, not his business: I honestly have no idea what he set the % at, and I understand if he's converting 100% of it to fiat that may not be as "cool" to but for a business to not convert at least a fair chunk of it to fiat is probably quite the gamble.

To check for my card, I apparently have to request a paper copy to be sent to me because I sure as heck don't still have that piece of paper anywhere.  I would never need/use a cash advance from my credit card aside from this unique use case.
Also, with the linked bank account option, what sort of risk do people run of getting their bank accounts shut down?  We've all heard the horror stories of Chase, etc, closing people's accounts due to bitcoin related transactions.

dumb question from someone who probably should have done more reading before asking:
Reddit says they want 10% of that $50M value to go back to consumers.
So what exactly would reddit build "on top of bitcoin" to ensure that the value of whatever chunk they have is still ~$5M USD in sum?  I'm assuming the idea here is to "color" certain BTC as being these reddit shares, or what have you?
Wouldn't the value of this "stock" or whatever you want to call it be pinned to the value of BTC =&gt; USD (or your local currency of choice) and doesn't that cause a problem?
I watched the video on colored coins and it doesn't really explain this too well. It just says you can color a coin and that somehow makes it a "token" for a thing - it's not very clear what that means, exactly?

I'm not suggesting it's "easy", I'm stating that the technology is there, because it is.
Take, for example, a Kinect sensor independent from the body of the person with the robot arm sending tracking data on the location of the beer glass.  From there, it's pretty much a "complicated" gimbal that you're sending data to in order to make a ton of complex movements.
Is it trickier than how a segway works? Yep.
Is it trickier than how a gimbal works? Yep.
Is it insurmountable with today's available technology and algorithms in robotics?  No way. It just hasn't been solved because it's kind of a silly / useless problem to solve.
In reality, though, the fake thing in that video is essentially a combination of 2 or 3 gimbal-type devices working in unison -- one to stabilize angle, and one to stabilize the position using various bends.  It's completely possible.

we may agree about not rewriting bitcoin in javascript, but this isn't a very valid or accurate statement at all.
Javascript is in its heyday right now as a language used for far more than rollover image swapping on websites.  It's by far the most popular programming language found on github and is being used for everything from backend to frontend and in between.
Furthermore, ES6 brings with it a lot of appearance and syntax that makes it more suited to "traditional" OOP.
More than any other language right now, Javascript is seeing transformation and innovation. Its heyday wasn't 10 years ago. It's now.

hey there. I'm a developer too, but I'm well over twice your age! I hope you don't mind that I'd like to give both you and a few tips because I think it's so awesome you're writing code and getting it out on the internet so early in life.
Here's the stuff I wish I'd known at 14... hell some of it I wish I knew at 24... 28... 30...
- no matter how good of a job you do, you're going to get negative feedback from some people because it's 100% impossible to make everyone like what you do. Just know this right away and focus on what you enjoy doing.
- Know that it's easy to let one negative comment deflate the good feelings of 10 or even 100 compliments. Try really hard not to let that happen.
- Know that most people who like software they're using don't bother to offer compliments, they just happily keep on using it and never say "thanks" - so if it seems you're receiving mostly negative feedback, that's because complainers are more likely to talk to you than anyone else!  That doesn't mean your app is awesome or that it doesn't suck - it just means you should trust your instinct. If you're happy with it, keep on keepin' on!
- Your response about why you created this app is perfect. You saw a problem with other apps that you didn't like, and you sought to solve it.  KEEP DOING THAT!  Find problems. Solve them. I don't care how much cleaner and more elegant your code is than the next guy if you're not *solving real problems*.  I'll take a fly-by-night kind-of-sloppy developer whose code works and solves problems over a meticulous "clean" developer who's so focused on code cleanliness that he or she isn't actually solving real problems.
Last piece of advice, and this is going to rub some people the wrong way: Remember that no matter how much you like programming, especially in your teen years and early twenties, it's *really* important that you get out of the house and hang out with friends, meet new people, develop great communications skills, etc.  
The stereotype that lots of programmers are socially awkward nerds who are often elitist and not very nice to other people exists for a reason -- and those people are less desirable to hire because unless you go into business for yourself right out of college, you're going to need to work with a *team* someday. You'll need peoples' help, and they'll need yours.  Being a good communicator and a generally nice / interesting person to hang out with -- even to people who aren't programmers -- is something you're still young enough to get awesome at!  Find interests outside of programming (music? sports? art?) that get you out of the house and into the real world.
BONUS: Getting into spaces outside of programming will make you see problems that programming can help solve in those spaces, giving you more fun / exciting projects to tackle! :-)
Keep on doing what you're doing - it's so kick ass that you guys are making / releasing apps at your age.  Keep it up, and stay hungry to learn more!
have a high-five on me, intergalacticrockets! @_date: 2015-05-05 21:09:25

His comment wasn't a non sequitur at all. He's absolutely right. Regardless of how much (or little) you'd win betting on black. 
The casino not needing to issue a form means nothing. You're actually liable for the taxes if you win so much as $1.
The cutoff there for the casino is only so that the casinos are doing less paper work but making sure the bigger winners are definitely tracked.  That doesn't mean that for people who win less they have no tax liability. It just means they'll probably get away with never reporting it on their taxes since there's less of a paper trail.

For many uses, the vast majority of Linode customers would probably never even hit their monthly bandwidth limit.
Linode is a VPS provider, **not a bandwidth provider**, so of course it's not going to be cheap if you need a metric shit-ton of bandwidth.
Most folks aren't hosting TOR nodes.

He doesn't.  I do, since I work here.
Obviously you don't have to trust me, but I do feel that my reputation on reddit should at least stand for *something*.
I can't delve into specifics other than to say that the endgame / path(s) to monetization has nothing at all to do with the sale of user data. I wouldn't have taken the job here if it did.

So in your opinion would it be better for me to skip bitpay altogether and just post my address and let people figure out how it is they want to pay me  rather than making the transaction simpler (or, at least it seemed that way to me)?

I'm completely unconvinced that I should be outraged with Linode.
Yes, their software got hacked.  Whose software hasn't ever been compromised or hacked if it was a big enough target so as to be tempting/worthwhile to someone?
Answer: nobody.
Your complaint that their response doesn't give details about what the compromise was is just not something I care about.  In fact I think they'd be stupid to tip their hand and explain in any detail how hackers got in - that seems like a pretty insecure practice, don't you think?
Sure, they screwed up in having a security vulnerability... but you've provided NO reason whatsoever that I should be upset.  Your only complaint seems to be that:
1) they got hacked, which happens to damn near anyone with something worth hacking into. 
2) they didn't give a bunch of detail about how they got hacked - which may piss you off, but it seems smart to me and I really don't need to know HOW it happened.. I just need to know THAT it happened, and what will be done to ensure it doesn't happen again.
These are not big enough reasons for me to leave Linode, and there's little to no more information from anyone about any real wrongdoing.

@_date: 2012-11-15 05:20:55
it's because a LONG time ago, when I first launched the RES website,  I screwed up the TTL (time to live) setting in varnish cache and it tells your browser to cache the page basically forever...
this wouldn't be a problem in many cases, except that nowadays people's browsers often have gigs of space to work with for the cache...

Actually, it will become more clear to people why bitcoin can be more attractive than fiat when they see the cost of moving money using each, and can easily compare.
We still care about / support Bitcoin, and if you read all the way (I know, it's lengthy) to the bottom half of the linked post / announcement you'll see we also care about decentralization.

I'd rather not see the price go bonkers on every news story - positive or negative. It shouldn't.  If it does, that just means that speculators are driving the entire ship.
there are a million other hurdles (in my opinion) for Bitcoin.  Not jumping up or down based on every news story isn't one of them.
@_date: 2011-05-16 15:52:40
Okay, my knowledge of encryption etc is just enough to sound like an idiot...  Here's what I still don't get:


Okay.. cool.. so what is going to be done with that, in layman's terms?
If I were to make a "guess", I'm getting something like this:
- Bitcoins are actually comprised of some sort of hash system that fits some "structure" that uses cryptographic math that's over my head...
- Computers "mining" for bitcoins, then, are using a brute-force method to find all of the valid possible "Bitcoin hashes" that fit some sort of mathematical definition... sort of like "find me all prime numbers between X and Y" - but obviously a lot more complex than that?
Am I even close to on the right track, here?
@_date: 2015-09-17 17:24:08

disclosure: I work for ChangeTip. I just want that to be out there so I'm not accused of astroturfing.
double disclosure: I welcome constructive criticism and differing opinions on ChangeTip, Bitcoin, etc. I don't take it personally.
a core difference with Flattr is that users must have a monthly stipend that's automatically divvied up amongst those you "flattr"... it's a similar idea, but a totally different mechanic and decision making process for the user.
Bitcoin, ChangeTip, etc offer the user more control over who they'll tip, when, and for how much.
There's also sites like Patreon that offer yet a different mechanic (e.g. "automatically pay a youtuber $x each time they produce a new video") -- again, cool idea, but less atomic control for the user of where/when/how much they tip.
ChangeTip's passion is to see content creators rewarded for putting out quality content on the internet. We're working on various ways to make that easier.
@_date: 2016-10-01 17:21:34

You can't withdraw directly from BTC to PayPal, but you can transfer from your BTC to USD pocket, then withdraw to PayPal.
There's also automatic transfer that can be set up for your convenience so the process is more seamless.
@_date: 2015-11-03 02:16:13
right now, only FB/twitter are supported on the mobile app - each OAuth method needs to be built individually.
If you log in to your existing changetip account, then connect one of those fb/twitter accounts to it, then you wouldn't have to have two separate accounts. There's also a way to merge them after the fact if need be.
More channels will come to the mobile app over time!

I'm not surprised at the negativity at all.
There's a segment of the bitcoin "community" that is hardline on their philosophy and doesn't understand the idea that not everyone thinks the way they do.  The only way the general populace will ever even consider bitcoin let alone start using it is if it's made extremely easy to do so.
That's not going to happen without a fiat&lt;-&gt;bitcoin bridge in the interim.
I guess I'd consider myself more of a bitcoin "observer" than enthusiast, but I've read and followed enough to know that the more vocal parts of the community are just.... not as well informed as they like to think they are about how Average Joe thinks/works/acts.

Hi there!  I'm a developer at ChangeTip and I'm working on just this sort of thing.
IRC is a really tough one, but I have some ideas on how to get it to work.

@_date: 2015-11-20 23:28:33


If you think we'll ever get there without a middleman to bridge the gap between using credit cards / fiat and using bitcoin, I don't know what to tell you.
The world doesn't change overnight, and the world doesn't make massive shifts/changes without really good reason, or without making it really easy.
Right now, acquiring and spending bitcoin is incredibly difficult compared to acquiring and spending fiat. Enthusiasts can talk all they want about how it's "not that hard", but as a web developer I can tell you that every tiny little extra step generally shaves away 90% of users who abandon the process. The steps of acquiring bitcoin are not tiny to the average person who isn't super motivated to complete the process - they're monumental.

No. Bitcoin is incredibly traceable. It's "pseudo anonymous" in that if you manage to buy in anonymously, then yeah - transactions you make can't be pinned to you and your identity.  However, someone could see the first transaction you make and see where bits go in and out of that wallet via the blockchain - that's the whole point - it's actually all public and available to "trace" -- just potentially without identities.
My interest in bitcoin has nothing to do with its anonymity. It's a technical curiosity for me, and the fact that it reaches across borders and offers some interesting ease of use potential (though we need to figure out better security before it blows up huge) by paying via QR code, etc, is awesome.  I couldn't care less if you can trace my bitcoin expenditures to my name. Go ahead. Find out that I bought a $10 amazon card from Gyft. I don't care.
The purpose of bitcoin isn't anonymity. It's decentralization and trust. Anonymity is a rather optional and somewhat red-herring-ish side effect.

that's the problem, I have no idea how much it is because their system doesn't tell me!  It could've been 0.01 BTC, it could've been 1 or 5.
[5 isn't unheard of]( though, so I'm not going to assume it's a 0.01 BTC tip.
it makes me all the more uncomfortable that I have no idea **how much** money I'm missing because they won't look into it.

I'm registered on almost all of those.
You don't just register for one and convert fiat to bitcoins.
You register for one, then use ANOTHER service to get money to it, and they are one or more of the following:
- cumbersome to set up
- require verification, which takes time, so they're not instant
- charge high fees - I shouldn't have to pay 4% on the dollar to buy bitcoins, that's highway robbery no matter how much you love bitinstant - same goes for Western Union and various other means of putting in money...
I'm set up for those things because I'm an interested party. For the casual person, setting up an account on any of those accounts goes something like this:
1) Sign up for site, let's say btc-e.com for example
2) realization that you can't just get bitcoins now that you have a btc-e.com account
3) so, you go to "add funds" and look at your options, which consist of the following for USD:
- interkassa (site is in some other languages, looks like russian?)
- bitinstant (which isn't usable by itself! you need to use ANOTHER service to get money into bitinstant AND pay 4%!)
- perfect money - (also not usable by itself. you sign up for perfect money THEN use another service to get money into it)
So now you're using anywhere from 2-4 services just to get money into btc-e depending on how the hell you do it.
Go ahead and be all "whatever, noob!" about it - but this process is shit for the average person.

yes, there's a level of idiocy that nothing can be dummyproofed for, don't get me wrong, but imagine this scenario:
2 years from now, your mom or dad is like "hey, type_your_name_here, I want to buy something from StuffMart, but they only accept bitcoin, how do those work again?" and you still have to respond "READ THE FAQ ALREADY, GOSH!", then Bitcoin is never really going to grow as big as we all hope/imagine.

I made a recent post, and I waited 9 days of not getting a resolution.  It was also a different topic than the normal coinbase posts.  I received money from someone via Coinbase and it has vanished. Not the same as the "hold" stuff everyone else is dealing with.
I didn't post looking for Coinbase to reply. I posted because people shouldn't use a site that can't be trusted with their money - often LARGE quantities of money.


I hate this attitude. Bitcoin is MONEY.  That's why you're here, right?  You believe in the protocol/currency? Coinbase is essentially a bank.
So if Coinbase is holding on to my MONEY, or my MONEY is out there in limbo, I shouldn't be "giving them the benefit of the doubt" -- that's MY DAMN MONEY.


I made a post recently, and I waited 9 days.
I'm not posting asking Coinbase for support. I'm posting telling you that **you should not use coinbase as a service** because they cannot be trusted with financial transactions.
We're 10 or 11 days away from my initial support request now and this is the latest thing I got back about my missing transaction:


Really?  Someone sent me money, I never got that money, and you can't even tell me about how long (past the 10 days that have already passed) it will be 'til you tell me if my money is gone?

My only Coinbase experience involves them telling me they are too busy to bother checking where my money went.
There is absolutely nothing I should be thanking them for.

you want me to trust my money with a company that can't be bothered to find out where money sent to me (but didn't arrive) actually went?
you've got to be joking.
@_date: 2013-11-23 18:31:57


someone who wants **money** that was rightfully sent to them and is therefore rightfully theirs is a selfish prick for actually, you know, wanting to know where that money went? You have no idea how much money that tip is worth, and it shouldn't even matter anyway.  Handling/trading Bitcoin is a financial transaction and therefore needs to have minimal to NO errors.
also, your username is clearly incorrect.

lower fees are the ONLY way I'll go that route.
I don't understand why there's so much love for a service that charges 4% to get your money in.
I get that they have to make a profit somehow, but 4% is a lot. At least a graduated scale would be nice - I get they've gotta charge 4% or maybe even 5-6% for really small transactions or they make virtually nothing... but who's going to put in $1000 or so and pay $40 just to do that?

I do pay for a server to host the RES website and distribute it.  Each release costs me a small amount of money ($20-30 or so, nothing too huge) due to the massive bandwidth hit of downloads and hitting the whatsnew page...
Everything else is client side... until I find the time and get over the logistical / legal hurdles necessary to work on settings/data sync to the cloud for RES. That'll require servers and whatnot as well.
@_date: 2013-11-14 05:33:47
great, ... now since you're in here promoting your own site, can you perhaps address the issue of BitTip tips disappearing and nobody responding to/about why, where the money went, etc?
Someone sent me my first BitTip and I never got it.  I contacted Coinbase with no response.
I then looked at the Chrome extension, and saw a review complaining about my exact scenario about a week or so ago.
This is extremely concerning, and has me very hesitant to use your service to buy BTC.

I didn't ask them to.  I am asking them to confirm whether or not it went anywhere on earth that is not me, or whether it's in a state of limbo. they've told me that I have received a tip - not merely that "it has been redeemed", likely because they're confusing the tip I was supposed to receive with the test tip I was given mentioned in my original post.
I'm also a developer, and I know that error messages aren't always accurate.  I also know that I'm not the only person who has had this issue.


that bot operator, by the way, IS Coinbase.

yeah. having them go from $1200USD to $600USD is no risk... sure... if by "no risk" you mean "lots of risk".
will that become untrue someday?  Sure, we hope, but cash is absolutely less risky right now due to far lower volatility.

how would that be possible when the token was sent only to me? Either way, their customer service ought to be able to see that.
let's say for the sake of argument that you're correct: sounds like a huge security flaw, if nothing else, doesn't it?
EDIT: for clarity: the code was privately messaged to me. it's 64 characters long. a brute force method of stealing it is highly unlikely, and at the very least coinbase's customer support should be able to very easily verify that whoever redeemed it was not me.

putting np there doesn't *actually* disallow participation.
it's just a CSS hack to *try* and disallow it.  if you have subreddit stylesheets disabled then the vote buttons etc aren't hidden and you can do whatever you want.
there's no actual reddit feature or standard for this "no participation" thing - it's just something that some subs added to try (probably unfruitfully) to stop downvote brigades from subs like SRD, SRS, etc.

@_date: 2013-11-23 20:13:40
I don't care who you work for. If you think it's acceptable for any company handling my money to not even be able to say "hm, the transaction with ID 12345 that was supposed to go to the address we have on file for you didn't go there"  just because BTC exchanges are "different from banks" - then you're nuts.  You're making a completely unrelated argument about how different BTC exchanges are from banks to justify them being needlessly irresponsible WITH MY MONEY.
I'm not an idiot. I understand how banks work - I even worked in financial services for a few years.
Just because banks don't OPERATE like BTC exchanges doesn't mean BTC exchanges shouldn't be able to answer simple fucking questions that require essentially a one query database lookup (or ideally some sort of admin tool making it a few clicks).

Hi there.
Interested in supporting more than just Chrome, by chance?
I'm the developer of Reddit Enhancement Suite, and I've been working on a cross browser extension development framework for just this sort of thing.
It's not as well documented / refined as I'd like it to be, mostly because I've only used it on my own stuff - but it's the product of a couple of years of stumbling and mistakes with getting Reddit Enhancement Suite working on multiple browsers - so I've learned a lot.
Yes, Chrome is the big kahuna - but Firefox and others are no slouches.
If you're interested, it's FOSS. Permissively licensed, and I'm happy to help answer any questions that arise due to lacking docs.

why? it's been 9 days and nobody at Coinbase can even tell me what's going on.

just made an account the other day.  LocalTill is a cool idea but is still a barrier to entry that requires me going out and depositing cash somewhere.  Wire takes 1-2 business days and costs $15 which is really expensive unless you're depositing &gt;$500 or so.  
I haven't explored CapitalOne 360 yet though. Is that what you use?
@_date: 2013-11-24 00:57:32


there's no expected date, but someone finally got back to me (not from their customer support, but because of reddit).
the money never got to me, but they tell me it was 0.01 BTC (I didn't know the amount before, could've been 5 BTC, who knows) and I'm far less worried about it.
They still have a serious support issue in my opinion.  It's not acceptable to be unable / unwilling to look into where someone's money went.
That being said, I do feel a little better now... I'll trust that it really was 0.01 BTC and move on...

@_date: 2013-12-13 09:50:57
not exactly...
it's more of a framework to allow you to write Greasemonkey-like scripts as browser extensions that work in all 4 major (non-IE) browsers.
all 4 browsers already support something like Greasemonkey (which is now basically kind of obsolete), but it takes a little more work and the APIs differ between all 4.
BabelExt abstracts that out so you can use the same commands to accomplish the extension-specific behaviors of all 4 browsers... things like cross domain xmlHttpRequest, etc.

Try moderating a subreddit yourself and growing it to 20k, 30k or more users.
I'm the author of Reddit Enhancement Suite.  I created as a place for people to discuss RES, request help, etc...
Around the time we hit 10k subscribers, people started posting memes here and there.  It was annoying to me because I dislike them, but I let it slide.
Around the time we hit 20k subscribers, people were posting feature requests and bug reports as image macros instead of text posts....  Not screenshots of an issue -- image macros/memes.
This happens with growth, period.  Even in places where it has no place / relevance whatsoever.
The same, by the way, is true of - where we have instantiated a ban on memes and other "low effort content", and our users thank us for it.
is/was a great place for discussion of all things hockey, and was lauded as being a place of civil discussion and discourse even between fans of rival teams, who usually devolved into swearing and namecalling on forums like HFBoards, etc...   was "the panacea" of online hockey discussion...
once we hit around 20k subscribers... BAM.. memes... trashtalking... immature idiocy...
Why?  Because the teeming masses just want to content-graze, and they upvote...
People don't really downvote all that much in general [unless it's a headline they disagree with, in which case they often downvote without reading].  
That people upvote far more than downvote has been confirmed by the reddit admins, and therein lies the problem.
People mostly only vote for stuff they like, and it's easier/faster to vote on content that takes 3 seconds to consume.  You're right there, you don't forget after being deep in reading/thought, etc...
@_date: 2013-04-28 17:31:03
thank you so much!
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:53:02
let's continue to assume you're correct, and someone 'stole' my tip (which I don't really believe)...
it should be trivially easy for them to see that it was redeemed by someone who is not me. there is no "tracking every click"
there is simply "does the address that tip X went to match the address of the person to whom it was sent?"
So let's just say that you're right, my tip was stolen, etc... this indicates:
1) an absurdly bad security flaw considering the token was **privately messaged to me**, and it's a massively long string (it's 64 characters)
2) poor customer service considering they can't/won't verify that the tip was actually "stolen"
I'm not sure why you're so bent on defending them here.

Nice ad hominem. You seem to act like you know it all about business, but:
If people can't trust their money with an exchange like Coinbase, and people keep getting ripped off, they'll eventually leave.
If it's impossible to create an exchange/institution that can at least have competent enough support **to answer simple questions**, then the business model is unsustainable.
You're operating on the assumption that exchanges like this MUST exist, and MUST never charge bigger fees (actually, you're saying they MUST "steal from the public"!)
What you're really saying is either (we'll use Coinbase as an example):
1) Coinbase's business model is untenable and they're either going to need to start charging fees so they can sustain support...
2) Bitcoin exchanges will never be trustworthy because the fees are too low to sustain any sort of support, so if something goes awry with your money, too fucking bad for you.
 is an absolute dagger in the heart of Bitcoin and essentially means it can/will die, so we might as well all just stop using it now.

I have a few questions for you - and I recognize that they're "tough" questions, but I'm asking out of healthy skepticism and strong interest... I used to play a lot on UltimateBet and Full Tilt - which should speak for itself.
Here are the things I'm concerned about and the reasons I'm not playing:
1) You've mentioned you have a strong legal team - but that's about protecting your site.  What can you tell potential US players to make us feel like it's "ok" to play on your site?  What's the reasoning behind your decision to accept US players - not just to protect your own butts, but what makes you think those users won't get in trouble of their own?
2) What are your randomness methods?  A huge paranoia about online poker is that it's rigged - and although it's extremely rare, it happens.  Any new kid on the block needs to be able to explain to me how good their shuffling algorithms are etc for me to even think about trusting them.
3) What is your stance on software like PokerTracker, and what sort of hand history do you have available?  It is my strong opinion that while hand histories give those with tracking software a potential advantage, that playing field is relatively level since it's available to everyone.  Furthermore, it's through software like PokerTracker etc that cheating *by the site* is discovered (essentially through finding mathematically impossible win rates, etc) - and I find any site who bans/disallows it to be suspect.
4) What sort of oversight is there of your company, and by what governing bodies and/or well known poker figures/players, if any?  I realize you can say anything you want here, but I'm still interested...
I see you're offering 50% lifetime rakeback which is great - but how long does that offer stand?  Does everyone get it forever, or is it just for early adopters?
Also, what sorts of stakes do you intend to go up to, etc?
I am keenly interested in finding a legal way to play online poker again, but for reasons I hope you'll understand, I'm also looking for as much info as I can get before choosing a site!

Simple. I'm going to stop using / remove any money I have from any exchange that can't answer simple questions like "when Bob sent me 0.5 BTC I didn't get it, where did it go?" within a reasonable timeframe.
In my Coinbase example, I've waited 10 days and the last response I got from them was literally "we're too busy to check on it for you and can't tell you when we'll be able to".
if you honestly think that's acceptable, then I have to say I think you're kind of crazy.

this will never happen unless it surpasses [insert local currency here, e.g. USD] in use.
if I get paid in USD, I'm going to be thinking of conversion rates FOREVER because I still need to convert it back and forth to BTC, even if I end up using BTC all the time.
if this is your opinion of what it takes for BTC to be "a currency", then I'm pretty sure BTC will never be a currency. not unless it completely takes over the world and we're all on a universal system (that system being bitcoin).  That would make it **the** currency, not **a** currency.

if you want bitcoin to succeed, you're going to need it to be newb-proof...
"STFU noob" is just about the dumbest argument I can possibly imagine making against people's skepticism of bitcoin.
it's in our best interest for it to be easy to understand, easy to use, etc.
@_date: 2013-04-28 06:07:53


maybe as soon as someone can fund development of a project that big...
@_date: 2013-04-28 03:32:35


already done. if you're on chrome you'll have to wait around 24 hours or so.
if you're on firefox, turn on the bitcointip module. :-)

they say they noticed one or more of the following problems... they don't say they shut you down because you accept bitcoin.
I'm not saying PayPal aren't being dicks here... 
I am, however, suggesting that you might be drawing the wrong conclusion....  you MIGHT be... you might also be right, but I don't think it's fair to say that you were definitely shut down because you also accept bitcoin.
You could've provided info they believe is false/inaccurate/misleading, and/or you could've violated the AUP somehow (which is probably easy as hell to do if you don't read the whole crazy ass thing), etc...

piss off.
I was one of the most recent coinbase complaint posts and it's because I waited 9 days to get no reply as to where my money was.
instant gratification?  They have MY MONEY and can't even tell me where the hell it is.
after 10 days, I finally got a reply from someone at Coinbase saying "Hey, sorry we just don't have time right now to pursue this. Way too busy with other stuff. Unfortunately, I don't have a time estimate for you either."
If your bank said "sorry, we don't know where your money went and we don't really have time to look into it" - would you think that's OK?
you're insane.
@_date: 2013-04-07 08:50:03
ah ok, if you're talking about wayyy-backend stuff, I get it.
I thought the main criticism was that the client-facing stuff (the website) was made in PHP...
'course crappy SQL queries are gonna suck no matter what, but memcached and APC can help a great deal.
@_date: 2013-06-06 05:23:55


so the path forward is for BTC to be forever relegated to a sort of "spare money for certain stuff" kind of thing then?
unless you think my job is gonna start paying me in BTC.. which frankly would be a **bad** thing since there's way too many things I can't buy with BTC yet and as you mention - conversion both ways is and you say will continue to be inconvenient...
that seems pretty grim to me.
@_date: 2013-04-25 09:06:55
seeing as they're posing as reddit site admins, you should probably report this to the actual admins.
@_date: 2013-11-23 19:55:33
I didn't say they behave the same way financially.  I also didn't say anything about expected speed of transactions. That's not even a debate, and we don't disagree there.
I said they should be expected to answer questions about "where is my money that has magically vanished?" within a reasonable timeframe - even if the answer is "it's still on hold as X Y and Z happen". The answer should never be NO answer, or "we don't know".
@_date: 2013-05-18 15:21:40
You can't buy bitcoins with bitpay.  Bitpay is like paypal except they only deal in bitcoin, basically.  It's a "safe" way to receive bitcon as payment.
Bitinstant is a site that lets you convert fiat (USD, etc) into bitcoin at a fee of 4%.
@_date: 2013-11-23 21:57:48


jesus, thank you. this didn't even occur to me as I got into a back and forth with him.
it makes sense now, he just read the title...
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:11:02
we need one that doesn't.
I'm not asking for much handholding here. I'm asking for someone to be able to do a simple lookup and say "ah yes, transaction with ID 12345 seems to have gone through to a BTC address that doesn't match the one we have on file for you"...
that's it.
not fucking rocket science.
@_date: 2013-04-28 17:25:27
I work for [Sencha]( - I'm familiar with such tech :-)
It's still a lot of work to build an app, especially if you want to offer native-ish styling, etc.
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:35:01
I understand that, but if a developer has time to reply to me and say "we can't be bothered to help you right now", then you have the 2 minutes it takes to go in a database table and look up Token ID 12345 and Account ABCDE and see if the coin in Token 12345 went to Account ABCDE. 
If I'm to be expected to wait weeks for an answer on where money destined for my account actually went - AND expected to be OK with that, then bitcoin is doomed.
@_date: 2013-12-23 08:33:36


you state "this is a short term problem" like that's somehow a guarantee / fact. it's not. it's a hope.
if you or anyone could predict the future, we wouldn't even be having this conversation.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:44:45
this is why as much as (some vocal) users hate moderators and want to decry them as censors, they are needed in certain areas of reddit.
any sub that breaks 20k or 30k subscribers ends up devolving into this kind of garbage, unfortunately.
@_date: 2013-12-23 08:03:33


these people aren't all non violent, it seems... if the charges are to be believed, at least.
@_date: 2013-04-28 07:06:15
thanks so much, appreciate it!
@_date: 2013-04-28 01:29:42
@_date: 2013-04-28 04:28:30
thanks so much!
I actually just set up a litecoin address because I got curious about it.

@_date: 2013-04-08 07:02:08
Yeah, I'm kicking myself.
I was too busy to read up enough on bitcoin to feel like I had any business accepting it as a form of donation for Reddit Enhancement Suite.
I only started a while ago, back when BTC were at $10 USD, and I haven't "advertised" it much.
Had I started earlier and actually asked for donations rather than being so damn coy about it, I could have some serious money in the bank.
@_date: 2013-11-25 21:18:54
but someone had a good experience, so you're wrong! *sigh*
I will say my bad experience with Coinbase ended up ultimately getting settled out in a mostly-acceptable manner, but not without more trouble than should've probably been necessary along the way -- and there should be nothing wrong with me saying that.
@_date: 2013-05-18 14:00:59
I used to work in that industry.  4% is a lot.
As for someone putting in $1000 not being their market: So you never intend for bitcoin to get to the point where, for example, someone might buy a TV?
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:04:31
yes, I am.
there'd be a LOT worse things going on than one little BitTip missing.
again though.. let's just say I'm a computer illiterate idiot who got malware - why can't Coinbase say "oh, looks like that tip was claimed by someone else, not you"...
there's NO REASON. NONE.
[see also...]( -- see? I'm not the only one.
@_date: 2013-04-28 01:45:49
thanks! :)
@_date: 2013-11-23 22:52:37
yep. apparently I'm a total asshole / idiot for wanting an answer to the question "where did my money go 10 days ago?"
@_date: 2013-04-28 04:16:43
yeaaaaa ok. not real for anyone wondering.
@_date: 2013-04-28 17:30:09
holy crap, that wasn't a typo was it?  I don't want to benefit from a mistake - if it was a typo please let me know and I'll refund immediately...
regardless of whether it was 5 or supposed to be 0.5: thank you so much!  wow... you are awesome!
@_date: 2013-12-16 18:19:53
give it 48 hours to be (relatively) sure you feel the higher ups have seen/noticed it and it wasn't just someone who's about to get reprimanded/fired...
if the tweet's still up then, then I'd say it was approved.
@_date: 2013-04-28 17:22:34
thanks so much!
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:39:52
you seem like a smart guy despite the fact that we disagree. It's too bad you're incapable of avoiding being an asshole about it.
had you only said:
"I'm supporting the notion that extricating society from the grips of the banking cartel will be a very painful process." at the beginning, and left out the snarky douche comments after, I'd have at least agreed with you that this makes sense while disagreeing that I should just accept that my money is gone.
it's too bad you're such a dick. you live close by and you seem like an intelligent person, but I couldn't buy you a beer without simultaneously wanting to tell you to your face how disappointing it is that you're incapable of disagreeing with someone without being a dick.
@_date: 2013-04-28 03:28:10
you're the man, thanks!  mmm cinnaminnamon.
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:45:07
on the flip side, you think maybe a company willing to accept over $30k in transactions could better communicate to their users that it's going to take some time, since this keeps happening OVER and OVER - maybe it's a communication problem on Coinbase's part, no?
@_date: 2013-04-28 03:38:18
shit man, you should see my coworkers! javascript gurus, the lot of them. they remind me I've still got plenty to learn.
@_date: 2013-09-04 01:48:18
Honest question: if I can sell 1btc for significantly more on gox than I'd get in gift card form, why is it bad of me to think that's not a great deal? 
@_date: 2013-12-08 23:09:53


if you think this crap is the "spirit of reddit" then you must be new here (as in within the last 3 years)...
reddit used to be my go-to place for serious and informative content.
@_date: 2013-04-28 02:10:04
yeah I never expected people would spam it like that... ended up feeling guilty / like I needed to do something to stop that.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:39:26
@_date: 2013-11-23 22:17:44


but some of them are perfectly valid today, but hopefully won't be in the future.
for example:




These are both reasonable points that we're collectively hoping to see invalidated *in the future*, but they're perfectly valid now.
I don't really benefit much as a consumer from buying something (say via Gyft) with Bitcoin right now at all.  You may come up with some reason you feel I benefit - but I don't really feel I benefit, so I'm not going to choose it over USD right now as a way to make a transaction.
I still believe in Bitcoin's future, but that doesn't mean that arguments like the two I quoted above are "wrong".
@_date: 2013-11-23 19:26:52
well thanks for the kind words, appreciate it.. I'm definitely no celebrity.. just a code monkey!
