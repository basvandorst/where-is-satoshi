Yes, password just transform the binary translation of the nemonic, probably you can generate every posible wallet using the same nemonic and different passwords.
From the crypto standpoint you now have a 2 of 2 seed, the same can be acomplished splitting the nemonic in 2 parts and adding random words to every half.

Nodes prevent double spending, they don't accept a transaction that is not valid and they don't accept a transaction that is not valid.
If transactions is in every node in 12 secs then there is no need to do anything.
But if your problem is that you don't believe on what a block says, then you should wait for enough blocks to make you feel good.
If you want 0 confirmation speeds then just wait for the transaction to arrive to your node, check that it is valid.
If you need more security store the transaction so you can replay it in case it is dropped by the network.
If you think the user is going to double spend on you then wait some time if he is trying to double spend the second transaction will arrive within seconds of the first and then just wait for a full block or 2 to see what happens.
Timestamping doesn't help on the double spend problems as double spend only works reliably when the network is splitted and the merchant is in the loosing braket, so the merchant will never get the second transaction with or without timestamp

frisco nice game, seems a lot more interesting than the dies

That graph = block reward * BTCUSD / transactions
Indeed = 3600 * BTCUSD / transactions
The number of transactions is increasing but still the price bubled and is still pretty high compared with early 2013 (just check that the graph is almost the same as 
This was expected, and the cost does not cost a dime to anyone

The wait for confirmations has nothing to do with timestamp.
It is a problem inherent to decentralized system when you need to wait some time until you are sure that the whole network agrees with a transaction, as you are only connected to some of the nodes.
The timestamp is provided by the block that accept the transaction.
In traditional banking systems the wait is for several days, so that's not a problem.

Any example that has enough information to educate the giftee? It is not that easy to open a new wallet and swipe a paperwallet when you only now that bitcoin is some kind of strange money.

I am unable to do it, it seem that they removed that feature as I can not find anyway to send to an email with their current UI.

But connecting a secure device physically to an insecure device just ruins it's security, you can change the firmware, to get the key, the transaction to be signed, monitor timing or power consumption for sidechannels exploits or whatever.
@_date: 2015-07-22 12:22:19
Yeah maybe security by obscurity was not a great analogy but my point was that we know it can be broken but it just need an exceptional effort to break it as in a security by obscurity scheme where you need an exceptional effort in reverse/change the code to break it.

Unless a bug is found to bypass that or the virus just waits until the user initiate a firmware upgrade and then replace firm to be upgraded.
There are several realistic attack vectors when the machine that is connected to is compromised and that's the point of the question.

The missing part is "If everything works as it should" HWallets do not implement any command or interface to read the key. If no bug is found (and open sourcing the code helps on that side) the only way to retrieve the key is changing the firmware (replacement/ FW virus) to be able to send it over USB.

They are devices that work on security by obscurity basis, not on the protocol or crypto but on the hardware.
They are open source etc, so no closed sources but having the key in a separate device that can only be accessed with human intervention allows you to avoid all standard virus, trojans et al that can easily read a file in your HD.
They are by no means a cold storage or super secure, I can think on several attack vectors but all of them need especific attacks for that hardware.
It is like having a safe in an insecure property, it can be broken but it is easier to just get the TV and the PC as probably the contents are not worth enough to justify the effort unless an easy way is found to open the safe.
HDWallets companies work just to be sure there is no easy way, but nothing else.

Sure it is the only one that has been proven but firmware replacement or transaction mutation are feasible but no one has took the effort to create a PoC.
Power consumption side channel vector seems to be fixed and  in the same fix it implemented timing attack mitigation but both of them are exploitable remotely.
Of course the PoC needed a oscilloscope but the system can monitor voltage on the 5V line to get information probably it does not have the same resolution and it will be noisier but theoretically it can be exploited remotely.

Really nice explanation I thought I had all the information about the SPV fork but had no idea of the hash stealing techinque, but as you said it is expected that miners do whatever get them more BTCs.
So maybe the whole blocksize debate could be solved with improved block distribution and verification improvements, maybe you can make a preblock distribution with the hash and the list of txids included with minimal footprint and in the best case scenario other nodes could just verify the txids are in their mempool and validated, and doing a full block validation as soon as possible, this could lead to more orphan rates in some cases but allows increasing the blocksize and improving propagation. 
Anyway it seems that improving block propagation is not in the agenda right now while it seems that is a real problem even today.

And it seems that you also did not read carefully OP is not asking about how easy is to get BTC, a paypal clone API could be done right now, except the recurring payments part, he is not asking about how easy is for the buyer to get the BTCs or for the seller to retrieve that BTC.

We need some more info to help you.
As I understand from your post that transaction was received a log time ago, and for some reason even if it appeared as confirmed before it does not appear as such now.
If the transaction was not added to a block when you sent it the only way to confirm it is recovering the signed transaction and replaying it on the network, if there is a problem with fees then a child pays for parent will work to get it included, the problem is getting that transaction source as it is not in the network anymore. But if it appears in your client it could be there.
If the transaction was included in the block then you don't have too much to worry, maybe you don't have that receive address created in your backup and you can just create it and it will appear.
To help you further we need to be sure in which situation we are, and posting what address was the receiving end (or emiting) of that transaction will help, if you have the transaction number it will be even better.
That info should appear in the transaction tab of your client, in your csv there are only 2 unconfirmed transactions that does not match the value you are saying, and there is no transaction with that value.
