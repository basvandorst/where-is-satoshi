At some point we are going to have to stop pretending that social security is anything but a second federal income tax. (ironically, one of the most regressive too) No money is being saved towards retirement, no investment is being made, its simply spent like all the other taxes.
This means social security is doomed, and should have never been started in the first place.

I suppose its a network effect thing; society doesnt have mental capacity for more than one properly operating global crypto at the moment. I imagine that will change at some point, but for now it seems btc is the only legitimate crypto network.

Do you think trump will be good for bitcoin ? certainly hillar would have banned it. What is your prediction for this administration?

There are two main factors
* Technical analysis. Many bitcoiners are competent enough to review the designs of alts and judge them on that. For example, litecoin suffers from the fallacy that faster blocks are better and that hardware mining is bad. So its rather doomed, and many alts fall in this category
* Obvious scams are the second factor. If you look at maidsafe or ethereum, its a patently obvious rigged market pump/dump with a highly centralized mining/development core. You have to be a true sucker to fall for these.
That said, I want there to be viable alts more than anyone. I dont know why there have not been any serious/viable ones, but I suspect there isnt enough mindshare yet.  You forget how small crypto is still.

24 base words is too much. 12 is plenty for security, and a lot easier to memorize. I wish the trezor guys would fix their recovery procedure so they can default to 12 again.

Sadly, that seems to be the case for the most part. Would prefer that was not the case, but we have to deal with the reality as it is.
A few alts are just jokes, but yes mainly scams.

Its actually not quite so simple; miners get a vote per hash for the next block but not necessarily anything else. Exchanges, Traders/Users, and node operators all have a say as well. A protocol consensus among node users is the strongest form of vote in the network as a whole.

thats just the built-in stuff. I dont think its even possible to disable most of it.
You would have to rebuild your c compiler toolchain, rebuild the kernel, then rebuild the whole system from the ground up to get rid of it. Selinux you can turn off.
these are the reasons you dont see much linux malware, despite it powering the vast majority of server infrastructure.
The interesting part is that someone has found a way to monetize the ignorance/laziness that goes in to choosing to run windows. Its still a valid choice for many people, but now it has a clear price. Its the digital equivalent of storing your wallet and car keys on your front porch; sometimes unscrupulous people rob you.
@_date: 2017-02-14 01:14:36
Because its a damn hard target.  NX Stack hardening, ASLR randomization, LXC jails, Capabilities/selinux and countless other features beyond the obvious mean you cant easily write functional malware. Even with a valid 0day, you could spend ages getting an exploit to work and even then it will run on one machine only for up to two weeks.

opposing Net Neutrality™  only makes sense for someone who wants actual net neutrality.
The solution to our internet problems is state level deregulation, not giving the FCC the power to pick winners at a national level.

Sure, you can write whatever you want. Most java programs qualify as malware on some level.
Its just incredibly difficult to get people to install it for you or for it to self-propagate.

That's horrific you lost over 120K dollars in one year? - 107.82% loss doesnt even make sense, you can declare bankruptcy.
And how did you get negative bitcoin ?
@_date: 2017-02-17 04:37:50
i think its if it trends to 1$ per 1BTC for any significant amount of time, mbtc are a good way to reckon with values. If I told you the price of a piece of machinery was 800mbtc, you would have a very good idea of roughly what that means.
so as long as the price stays between 800 and 1200 for a while, we are living in the millibitcoin era. 
I wonder how long it will last.

And you dont need to tap phone lines or hack cell phones to do it. You arguments against privacy are anti-individual IMO, because you are asserting that you cannot protect the water if people have absolute privacy.


I agree, but perhaps in a different way than you think.
The one universal solution to the "Tragedy of the Commons" is quite simply: "dont have commons" and bitcoin can be a part of that. Each satoshi has unambiguous mathematical rules for ownership.
If we eliminate other commons in the physical world to match, then the tragedy will disappear along with them.

Are they saying regulators are stupid?  I mean aside from the obvious fact that price regulations themselves are one of the stupidest ideas in history, dont they see that the per-unit price does not change whatsover?

They care, but are not allowed to tell you about what or why.


This is the new way things are done.

It sounds like the IRS wants to push people towards international exchanges, informal exchanges, or direct peer to peer trading.

This disinformation is strong here, dont let it get to you. bitcoin is working as designed and better than ever. There is a small but persistent crowd either trying to pump their shitcoin'o'the'week or simply trying to keep bitcoin from spreading.
@_date: 2017-01-10 02:53:28
sounds like you should consider OTC trading instead of using exchanges.
The banks are not going to participate in their own undoing, so you should not expect any bank to help you make them obsolete.
@_date: 2017-01-10 03:15:54
Right, of course, thats why they are not kicking you out of their bank.

Well they will borrow for zero, but they wont loan out for that.


Correct, they turn down business all the time.

This sounds a lot like a premature conclusion. If anything, there is no real upside to the surveillance for either government or the people. If someone is a lawbreaker in a meaningful crime, then there are plenty of physical world ways to catch them, and you dont need to poke into their privacy to do it.
On the other hand, if the law is at fault, criminalizing voluntary association, then its perfectly fine to see if technology can make it impossible to eavesdrop, and effectively make the law unenforceable.
Laws such as "hate speech" or "money laundering" are criminalizing non-criminal behavior, and hopefully we can make the world a better place by making such laws unenforceable.
