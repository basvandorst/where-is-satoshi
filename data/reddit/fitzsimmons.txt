Right but in order for a transaction to be confirmed, someone has to do proof of work. And that costs electricity. So if there's no reimbursement for confirming transactions, it's a money-losing proposition. Then nobody would do it, meaning transactions would never be confirmed, making it impossible to use bitcoin at all.
In conclusion, proof of work is a bit of a problem, eh?

After a certain point the pool will be fully mined. So I guess your sarcastic comment now is actually just a sincere comment from the future.

But did they fix their currency rounding/imprecision problems?

They made it mandatory to have a G+ account in order to interact with youtube in any way, and broke/removed a number of important features from the UI while doing so.

No, I'm pretty sure he's calling the bitcoin movement stupid and ignorant. I mean, that's what I took from it. The amount of bitter entitlement that comes out of a fringe movement is completely unjustified.
Don't get me wrong, I consider cryptocurrencies to be interesting and I think that the replier in OP's screenshot could have responded with a bit more tact.
That still doesn't justify entitlement coming out of a community that is rife with uncertainty, scams, technical concerns, political extremism, a cult-like following, etc.

They're targeting a group of people that they already know are security-ignorant and gullible. It makes perfect sense.

Nothing inspires confidence like crossing bitcoin and wordpress. What could possibly go wrong?

True, I guess you can decode the image with a JS library on the client side?

Trade for goods and services!? Their infrastructure is completely destroyed! Sending them fiat is useless too, but bitcoin is just plain dumb because they don't have access to things like food or shelter, let alone electricity and internet connections. The whole point of the Red Cross is that they can show up with food, temporary shelter, and medical supplies, and most importantly able-bodied &amp; educated rescue personnel.
@_date: 2015-01-07 21:56:53
Okay, describe to me how you're going to send bitcoin to someone in a disaster-torn area without the internet or electricity.
And I guess while you're at it, then describe how you're going to do it in a fashion such that you verify that it has been received by the intended recipients and it's not all just going to looters and gangs.
@_date: 2016-09-23 21:22:27
Yeah, agreed.

A git rebase is absolutely a (local) rewrite of a bunch of git history. You could force-push a rebase but doing so would screw up everyone else's history of that branch.
A rebase figures out where the current branch and the target branch diverged, picks up all the commits, and re-applies them like patches on top of the target branch. Typically you only do this locally, but it does effectively re-write every commit on the branch that's being rebased.
The only thing that could be referred to as "moving pointers around" would be `git reset --hard [target sha]`, followed by a force push.

Uhhhh, like 80% of the mining power is in China. Bitcoin is "uncensored" only until China decides otherwise.

Consider something like keybase filesystem, which operates somewhat similarly to dropbox, except that everything is encrypted over the wire and at rest. From the service provider's point of view, they never have access to the private keys and essentially store arbitrary blobs of data that they're not capable of decrypting under any circumstances.
Given that the way the product works makes it resistant to backdooring, they would simply have to shut down the service in the US and any other country with a backdooring requirement.
Whatsapp (facebook) have also run into this problem with their end to end encryption, which ended up getting them banned from Brazil (for a few days).

While this could enable cool stuff I haven't thought of, I assume it'll have the same major usability problem as Freenet: no dynamic content - nothing with logins or dynamic in any way, like searching, sorting, filtering, etc. I suppose it could be possible to host client side apps where all data is static and cached, then processed on the client side for formatting - but why do this instead of (for example) installing a browser extension?
I can't imagine page load times will be very fast either. And unlike Freenet, it doesn't have anonymity or encryption.
What is the point of this?
@_date: 2015-09-06 08:01:05
I know what you're getting at but, I mean, is it wrong though? General purpose mining has been unprofitable for ages. The only people running miners would be people maliciously getting power for free.

Not sure. My fairly ignorant assumption is that if it's resistant to quantum computer attacks it would also be resistant to a hypothetical P=NP attack. But I don't know!
@_date: 2015-09-09 18:53:31
Public key crypto is based on the fact that factoring large numbers is NP. If P=NP, public key crypto is broken.

Case design these days is supposed to help with cooling by drawing cold air from one side and venting hot to the other. It will still end up recycling hot air, but not nearly as badly as a open-air motherboard. It doesn't help airflow in a positive way to not have a case.

What, no, of course not.
But usually whenever there's a major breach, it turns out to be the most petty, amateurish, drama-driven stuff out there, which makes it comedic.
The perceived value of the loss also adds to it.

The IV is still an input, even if it is usually internal to the implementation.

There's a limited supply, therefore the currency is deflationary. Unless the amount of value in the world starts going down...

Why would I pay 0.05 BTC for a burger today when 0.05 might be worth 10x or 100x as much in USD in a month?
Being able to buy food doesn't change the fact that bitcoin is a deflationary currency.

Don't get your hopes up, a lot of us are just here to laugh at security breaches.
@_date: 2013-05-21 18:52:25
It's deflationary.
Someone with 50% of the network's processing power can subvert it.
Each client requires a massive file of all the transactions ever, which will only grow geometrically to the point where it is even more unwieldy than it is now.
So no, objectively, it has several critical flaws.
