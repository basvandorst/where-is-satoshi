I didn't ask about honesty, I asked about the way you 'discuss' is by name calling. That's a clear sign of losing a debate, and you started with that before an actual debate even started

yeah no thanks; they should've made a decentralised lottery instead of this money grab. Already a bunch of decentralised transparent lottery's exist in ethereum

Why do you talk like that? Trying to have a discussion here and you're acting immature with your lmgtfy links and 'Sorry to hurt your feelings', if you honestly want to have a discussion that'd be great but not if you're going to act like a manchild...

Back to you about what? You come barging in a discussion with lmgtfy links like its 2010 not bringing any valuable info to the table, don't really know why anyone would bother discussing with you

Great discussion to be had with you
