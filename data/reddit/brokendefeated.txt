I'm so going to buy that $1000 bitcoin in 2018 and 2019.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:57:24
Oh boy this thing is going to crash so hard.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:56:53
I missed nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:42:00
It won't happen over night, but during the entire 2018. It will start rising again in 2019 though.

I was alive in 2013, 2014 and 2015.

[Yo, BTC is now 180 USD, but doesn't matter anymore.](
Correspondence from 2015 with my friend from Latvia. Needless to say I didn't buy.

Chinese mining cartel is cashing out.

First check whether or not the owners are from the Balkans. If they are, run.
Guess where Bitstamp's owners are from.

I'm waiting for another 2015 so I can buy coins.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:36:47
Huge crash.

Most normies will start panic sell.

I'm outoftheloop. Sup with Wall Street?
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:55:19
I bought my first coins back in 2013, but I never looked at bitcoin as an opportunity to get rich, but as a convenient way to buy stuff with no fees. Now even PayPal seems like a better option...

I don't think so.

December 2013: $1000
January 2015: $180
It took two years to reach $1000 again. You don't need a crystal ball to see the trend.
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:46:15
I predict that the price won't go up any more and we'll see the slow decline over the next year with $1000 being the year's all time low.
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:47:14
Except the fact that the price would hit the rock bottom if he tried to sell those coins.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:10:40
I see it falling to $2.500 in a few months, and then in two years it will rise to $100.000.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:29:45
I predict $1000 is new low.
November 2017 is new January 2014.
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:36:18
Imagine how all those people who used BTC to buy weed on darknet feel now.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:11:31
Chinese dumping their load, like they did in 2014.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:02:10
It never arrived and I received a gift card instead of a BTC refund.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:26:50
BTC went to $11k thanks to people like you.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:36:44
I'll wait for the price to come down to $1000, invest hard and then wait for the $100.000 bubble to come, sell everything and retire early.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:22:50
I see that this $10k bubble is extremely similar to January 2014 $1k bubble. I doubt that BTC will go up this year anymore.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:57:53
I bought a pocket knife back in July 2015 for 0.06 BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:31:01
Or... Chinese coin cartels.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:46:28
My unprofessional estimation:
It won't recover, this is peak. It will slowly start to fall every day until it hits $2500, or even less.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:06:31
Freefall, freefall, all through life...
Chinese are probably dumping their coins, bubble is burst.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:23:57
Someone's retiring very soon.

My behi... I mean my experience. lmao
