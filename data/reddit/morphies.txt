This is my question. Also not seen anyone reporting back that it went through either. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:55:00
I find the mobile site more responsive than the desktop version. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:29:58
Super! Thanks!!
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:38:02
No, this problem. I knows it’s temporary. But I could do with this transaction moving now. 
I’m asking for a little help is all. Isn’t reddit supposed to be a community?
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:10:10
Cool story bro. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:15:32
Thanks for the advice. You managed to write a post that probably took 2 -3 minutes without managing to shed any light on the questions I asked. 
I appreciate your opinion on bread wallet though. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:31:27
I think you use the details in the top up of your revolut app. If you click on your normal payment option you should see bank transfer below. 
The revolut bank details and your reference number are displayed there. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:02:14
Thanks man. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:41:09
How large?
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:09:09
Yes. You’ll receive the same % growth or loss. It will just be proportionate to what you invest.
Forget about the $ value. Look at the % changes over time. If you like the look of it, get involved. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:13:01
Ignorance is bliss. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:52:27
It’s like a Christmas tree!
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:24:16
Me too
@_date: 2017-12-30 11:37:04
Thanks. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:51:37
I’d agree although I’ve diversified a little in some alts. BTc is by far and away the biggest mover though. 
Only because I sold my 32 ltc far far too early. Shoulda HODL’D :)
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:33:47
It’s a heavily used service at the moment. Keep trying.  
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:18:44
63919ec14999ee53632be5c26b1beb6079822bf972355c2d5c063fc9ecacc911 10 sat/b. Poor I know. Been stuck for ages. 
Thanks fella. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:10:28
This. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:28:25
Gdax for me. Fees are low / non existent. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:32:35
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:24:53
Revolut is a fantastic app. Enjoy buddy
EDIT: there is an option within revolut to purchase crypto directly. 
DO NOT USE. 
Simple use revolut as a transport for gdp to euro to Coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:07:05
Ok. Pools can be quite large and distribution is weighted on on involvement or success per block per individual. 
How do the pools that keep the fees keep members? Haha
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:47:50
I have.  It’s a personal, extremely personal decision. And not one I’m going to make based on the responses from this post. 
My rhetorical question was more to address those in a similar situation with perhaps less certainty on where they want to end up. 
Enticing some intellectual conversations. I should have just asked for a meme :D 
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:37:00
Revival! 1KSgsa8WmabLpbb1mA3WkRUjEkbh7Paw2R
Glad you paid the proper fees though. I have like 90% of my money in limbo with low fees!! 
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:48:38
I’ve tried that and failed. On numerous occasions. :)
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:14:34
I’m not invested for the ethics. I see a growth rightly or not.  Like I stated earlier. My main focus is bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:07:12
You don’t deserve it. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:41:06
The swings on this are mental. Haha
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:47:08
Tell me about it. Buckle up again. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:04:04
I can see that. I’d like to pull a portion. Just to make any potential drop a little easier to swallow. 
On he other hand I took the risk with funds I can afford to loose. 
Right now I’ve doubled. The potential of what bitcoin can do is exponential. It just needs the right kind of support. 
I can get behind that. I am behind it. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:04:55
Not as yet for me. Only been a day though. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:34:30
12 days here. Fun times. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:13:36
Definitely. 
Normal route for purchase is uk bank to revolut (gbp - free) gbp to euro within revolut (free) SEPA transfer from revolut to Coinbase (euro - anything from 1 to 5 days, usually within 48 hours) Coinbase to Gdax (free and instant). 
Placing limit orders for BTC in Gdax is normally free also. And transfer from the Gdax exchange to your wallet of choosing is again free. 
If you don’t currently have a revolut account (free to set up) please feel free to use my referral link:

The dips no longer bother me. 
I made a significant initial input. Which I’m now comfortable is fine. But I can see he benefit in dragging that out over the Xmas period.  
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:11:07
As far as I know you’d have to use Coinbase for instant purchases. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:01:39
It’s bitcoin. What’s rationale?
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:38:33
As I understand there is no way to move it to a wallet after purchase.
Also, are they publishing the prices? Or is it a sign 3 friends up and then be disappointed scenario?
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:20:36
Done :)
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:08:35
Problem is kicking yourself over not leaving it all in. Is that worse than kicking yourself for not taking it out?
Are you a glass half empty or a glass half full? 
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:29:35
Is half full an option :)
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:01:51
This. Because my transaction at 10/b keeps telling me it sent recently. Like sometimes just now.  It’s been stuck about a week. 
I use bread? How do I stop it rebroadcasting?
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:55:21
Edited, thanks.
