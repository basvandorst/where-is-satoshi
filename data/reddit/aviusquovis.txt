Lawlz. Well, as with tulips, bitcoins, dollars, diamonds, or gold, the worth and stability of a currency is based directly on the confidence of the people using it for transactions. Bitcoin certainly does not garner widespread confidence from the public at the moment, but I'd say it has certain important factors in common with gold that tulips and dollars do not share: namely, there is a finite amount of bitcoin, and it's hard (impossible, so far) to counterfeit. Whether it will ever gain the confidence it needs to be more than a novelty is yet to be seen, but it's certainly done better than some other attempts.

True. Buying less than 100 BTC would probably require someone local to sell you a few buck's worth, but the exchanges work fine if you want to buy 100, 101, 120, etc. You don't have to buy them just in 0.1 BTC increments.
Buying less than $20 worth is probably not that smart on the exchanges anyway, considering the transfer fees you'll likely encounter.

Yeah, I guess it didn't work like I wanted. I think millibits should probably start being the common unit soon, but you'd have to use centibits to easily show parity with USD at $100. Ah well.
@_date: 2013-03-30 02:10:07
And only 10 doubling periods after *that*, you're looking at a market cap of roughly  *1,024 trillion dollars!* that's more than 48 million dollars per coin, or about 50 cents per satoshi!

No joke. The last two days shook my confidence, not in Bitcoin's technical fundamentals, but its ability to interface with the world economy. 
The fact that it didn't die after crashing from $260+ all the way down to $50 is a huge point in its favor, I think. It followed the bubble chart perfectly, and I think that's pretty convincing argument that we've found the true valuation again. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:47:33
Born and raised here. Still think metric is better.
@_date: 2013-03-23 14:05:11
Exactly. One of the whole points of bitcoin is to let the market work without interference. Donating money to a for-profit enterprise because you like the idea artificially inflates the value of that enterprise.
@_date: 2013-04-06 03:49:00
I was only partly joking. I'm partly serious, though. Everybody and their mother has an opinion, ranging from "Bitcoin is a worthless scam in the biggest bubble since tulip mania" to "One bitcoin will be worth a million dollars in less than ten years". Those people vote with their wallets in the exchanges, and the current price is as close as you're going to get on a consensus.
I myself think bitcoin is currently overvalued in the short term, but undervalued in the long term. Therefore I've bought some with money I can afford to not see for a while, and I'm waiting it out, occasionally converting additional fiat to BTC if I can use it to buy something I was going to purchase anyway.

I would say one more thing is needed, though its really just a question of quantity: people have to find out about it. I get really optimistic here in the bubble chamber of the internet, but of the 20-30 people I've mentioned it to in real life, only one had ever even heard of it before, and he's a pretty big geek.
Bitcoin needs a super bowl commercial.

Absolutely. A mBTC is just 1/1000 of a bitcoin, and you can get them the exact same way. Most exchanges have a 100 millibit minimum order, but that's only like $25.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:55:51

Thanks for the recap. I checked the chart at 7:45, saw a couple of huge ask walls around 150, and went on a short jog. Came back at 8:00 and it was at 154. I was wondering what the hell happened.

I just used  to buy a few hundred dollars' worth. You don't need any ID or verification at all. It took about 45 minutes from when I signed up, through driving down to the local Bank of America to deposit the cash, to when the funds showed up in my account and I made the order. 
It looks like the bitcoin price is a bit higher at Bitfloor, but not enough to matter if you're talking about having to wait days or weeks.
@_date: 2013-04-16 12:06:14
Very true!
@_date: 2013-04-06 22:31:12
Yep, that's called arbitrage. Buy at Mt. Gox if you have money there, then sell at Bitfloor. Profit!

Bitcointip might not be the best way to handle it short term. Maybe someone who's not on their phone can give you some tips on setting up a secure wallet at home, then people can PM you the piece they want, and you can PM them a custom address to send the BTC to.
Amazing work, by the way! Major kudos from a fellow illustrator!

Meh, I don't think there's any harm done. The economic fundamentals of bitcoin pretty much ensure its (or something very similar's) long-term adoption. Amir is simply putting the breaks on a bit as we cruise down the mountain, which may actually make for a smoother ride.

I Sold some, and I held some. I'm pretty confident in bitcoin's long-term future, but I think it's going to drop a bit more once Gox opens. I've got dollars in Dwolla for just such an occasion.

You won't have missed out. at $100/bitcoin, Millibits (0.001 of a bitcoin) will be a steal at only 10 cents each, and they grow in value at the same rate as whole bitcoins! :)

I need to walk away (from not bitcoin itself). I'm no day trader, and the last few weeks have been super stressful. I can't take the volatility, so I've put my coins in cold storage and I'm unsubscribing. I uninstalled my price ticker app, I deleted my charts bookmarks. Maybe I'll visit once a week or so just to see what's up.

They have much smaller user bases, and I guess you pay a premium to avoid all the registration hassles at Mt. Gox.

That's true, and certainly a step in the right direction!
@_date: 2013-04-02 00:21:15
I have no idea. Technically it can't be done at all with the existing client. 
I just meant that in the case that CSFFlame described, where everyone agreed to ignore the theft transaction, and altered the code to allow such an action, the coins would simply revert to the pre-theft address, not be destroyed from the network.
@_date: 2013-04-04 22:08:43
Of course at that point dollars would be worthless, so a bitcoin/dollar comparison would have long been meaningless.
@_date: 2013-03-30 10:57:21
Haha, yeah my sarcasm didn't shine brightly enough I guess. I'm optimistic about bitcoin, but the OP talking about 10 or 20 doubling periods like they are quick and easy milestones seemed kind of naive. I was trying to illustrate that that level of growth is not sustainable in the long term.

@_date: 2013-04-06 23:21:24
Well, the whole reason for the price imbalance is that it's much easier to get money into Bitfloor, so people are willing to pay a bit more to avoid jumping through all of Mt. Gox's hoops. To take advantage of the situation, you have to have dollars in Mt. Gox.
@_date: 2013-04-02 19:43:09

I tried day trading for 4 days (only with a few hundred dollars I could afford to loose). I lost a bunch, then gained a bunch. When I realized that I had just barely broken even after so much time and stress, I decided it wasn't for me and decided to go for the long term instead.

most exchanges have a minimum order, of at least 100 (0.1 bitcoins) but if you want to buy 150 or something like that, it's the same as any other order. 
Other options include finding someone local who's willing to sell a few buck's worth.
@_date: 2013-04-08 14:57:12
You can put in as much as you're willing to risk. $10 or $1,000, it doesn't matter.

Bitcoin is a deflationary currency, unlike the US dollar, which is inflationary. That means that with bitcoin, saving is incentivised (prices continually go down), as opposed to USD, where spending is (prices continually go up).
@_date: 2013-04-06 23:52:48
I switched to CampBX recently, and I've enjoyed my experience. Much cleaner and easier to use than Mt.Gox, and still fully integrated with Dwolla. Your Dwolla account has to be older than 30 days to fund that way, but they're US based, so it's much easier to fund via other options as well.
Only thing that would make them better is if more people used them, as right now liquidity is a bit low. If you sign up with this code you get a 10% lifetime discount. Share the love! 
I've also had good experiences with Bitfloor, and if you're really in a hurry you can't beat their Bank of America cash deposit system.
Edit: to clarify that you *can* use CampBX even if you don't have a 30-day-old Dwolla account; you just can't fund via Dwolla.

Same here. The trade volume is lower for now, but it has all the convenience of funding with Dwolla, but a MUCH easier verification process than Gox. The graphs aren't as nice, but the trading interface is cleaner and has more features. Also: no trading lag.

That's the most in-depth and reasonable explanation of such a system I've ever seen, thanks. However, I still have a few major questions:
1) Does anyone have any theories on how it would be possible to arrive at such a society from the one we have now? Or examples of such a society functioning? Nothing like what he describes has ever actually occurred in the absence of a government, that I'm aware of. 
2) He seems to assume that a large enough majority of the population would approach all these things rationally and with forethought, but I think he's ignoring the mighty sway of other irrational ideologies. For instance, religious extremists often act as a group against their own best interests.
3) Finally, Say we manage to get such a society in place. It would be highly inefficient to have 100 different rights enforcement agencies in one town, so there would be a quick settling out due to agencies going out of business or merging. Over time, it seems that they would inevitably settle in to local and regional monopolies or oligopolies, which would be indistinguishable from the state system we have now.

Meh. I think the true valuation is closer to $50 than $70 right now. Zoom the price graph out to 30 days and look at how far above the trend it is.  The influx of southern Europeans may have given us a bump, but I see waaaaaay more speculators asking how to buy than I see scared Cypriots.
And I say this as someone who bought some for $78 on bitfloor a few days ago at the peak.

Say you mined 10,000 bitcoins in the early days when it was easy. 
Now you're living with a roommate you don't like in a crappy apartment, working part time at Gamestop for barely more than minimum wage. 
Also say you hold with those who believe bitcoin could reach heights upwards of $100,000 per coin in 20 years or so.
Now, you could hold out and toil in abject poverty for two decades, waiting to cash out at last for a cool billion, 
You could sell a few coins a month to increase your standard of living now, and just keep a few hundred in reserve for the long haul, content with merely ending up as a multi-millionaire.
This has the added benefit that if bitcoin crashes permanently to $0 next year for some reason, you still made quite a killing.
@_date: 2013-04-13 09:37:11
I think so. Regardless of how much it may one day be worth, the market is still dominated by people who want to maximize their wealth in terms of dollars. Those people will keep the market within a certain percentage of its current, as opposed to future, value by selling off en masse when it gets too far ahead.

I like bitcoin, I have a small number of bitcoins, and I'm optimistic about bitcoin's future, but what bitcoin is doing right now is not proving the haters wrong. The possibility of being in a bubble will not have fully passed until we've had a few *years* of price stability. Until then, bitcoin will not be able to shine at its true potential as a currency.

I switched to them recently, and I've enjoyed my experience. Much cleaner and easier to use than Mt.Gox, and still fully integrated with Dwolla.
I had to verify my Dwolla account, but that only took about a day and a half, which is way faster than the Mt. Gox queue right now.
Only thing that would make them better is if more people used them, as right now liquidity is a bit low.

Mt. Gox is shut down, so the price there is frozen. The Euro exchanges are still open, though, and falling.

For quick and dirty anonymous cash deposits, I go through Bitfloor.
If you have Dwolla set up already, or want to use checks or money orders, I'd recommend CampBX. If you sign up using this link, you'll get a 10% lifetime discount on all your trading fees:

And for that a heart-felt thank you. I bought pretty early on a lark, having no idea what was about to happen.  I absolutely got caught up in the excitement, but it was comments like yours that kept me cautious when I was tempted to take bigger risks than I could afford. You and the other nay-sayers deserve some props for putting up with the rest of us for our own good.

Perfect, seeing as how my "new camera fund" got turned into my "bitcoin investment fund"

I just set up an offline wallet with Armory yesterday. I'm not incredibly technical, but it was pretty straightforward. Still took a couple hours and a bit of a headache, though (including installing fresh OS on old laptop, testing with small transactions to make sure I did it right, creating paper backups, etc).
I think for mainstream adoption, there will have to be an adequately secure online/mobile option.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:34:52
Depends on the quality of your instinct. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:23:12
I don't think so. The average user doesn't have problems differentiating between meters and millimeters, or liters and milliliters.
@_date: 2013-04-06 23:20:13
Well, the whole reason for the price imbalance is that it's much easier to get money into Bitfloor, so people are willing to pay a bit more to avoid jumping through all of Mt. Gox's hoops. To take advantage of the situation, you have to have dollars in Mt. Gox.
@_date: 2013-04-02 00:11:16
You do need bitcoin-qt if you want to use Armory for your live/hot wallet, but if you're using it in offline/cold storage mode, you do not.

Who knows? Some forward thinking grocery chain could start accepting it next month. Or maybe not until it's 100x more widely accepted (and valued).

The attack is on Mt. Gox, which is causing a panic. The bitcoin protocol itself is still sound.

No, non-fiat money (such as bitcoin) is just money that is not set up by decree of a government.
@_date: 2013-04-06 00:37:26
Ah, must have skipped that bit. I guess Dwolla's position being fully owned and operated by an old school bank makes them more paranoid of the new guy.
@_date: 2013-04-07 21:18:20
Awesome design. Where did you source the tamper-evident tape? 
Also, was the treasure hunt just from the fact that you showed the private key in the video?  I was hoping I'd get to break out the GPS and head down to the park or something. :)

I wouldn't be surprised. Bubbles are psychological in nature. Now that most people are confident it's over, I think that one is over. On to the next one!

Bitcoin has become self-aware?
@_date: 2013-03-29 00:51:05
Yeah, I'm not supporting it (I certainly don't own any). I do think it's interesting though, and it addresses some of the things MildlySerious was talking about.

There is a 90-day claim window, and nobody will get their coins until after that. You'll only get your coins back then if nobody else files a claim for the same coins.

But what is "the state" but a rights enforcement agency that has achieved a monopoly?
Indeed, what is the USA but the natural result of a number of small, independent rights enforcement agencies (the original colonies/states) that have merged to take advantage of economies of scale, forming a monopoly on rights enforcement? One which is all too happy to use violence to enforce its monthly dues and prevent the emergence of smaller, more desirable competitors?

It can be difficult. The easiest/cheapest way is to set up a Dwolla account connected to your checking account, and get your Mt.Gox account verified, but both of those things can take several days or even a week if they're busy.
@_date: 2013-04-07 20:13:12
Maaaybe? If there was a way to be certain it wasn't, the price would be going up way faster than it is, if you can imagine that.
I'm quite optimistic about bitcoin, but I certainly haven't put in my life savings yet.
