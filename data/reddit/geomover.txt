You. Should have followed recommendations.
Every newbie should use a hardware wallet.

I agree with this.
If during a recession BTC price goes up, I would sell at least part of it to buy cheap traditional stocks, to consolidate gains .

Amazing answer... lol
Bitcoint at 7k is still cheap for bank. In 20 years that shit is going to worth a lot. There are only 21 million. No more than 21 million people can own one.

Oh yeah, but only 21 million people, at most, can own a full bitcoin. That´s what i tried to say.
How much will one bitcoin worth in 5-10 years.

I heard about azure ... Don't know much about... But don't you think it's gonna be threatened by decentralized services? There are some cryptos already trying to do it..

There are too many vulnerabilities in a web wallet... Many possible leaks. Email hack, insecure seed storage, etc
How did you store your seed? 
Your email may have been compromised also.
Did you follow all security steps in blockchain.info wallet, as suggested?
Without 2fa and all those security steps from blockchain.info wallet, your wallet is very insecure.
Hw are the only way to go with 2+BTC, as said before...
