That's not true at all. Just because you have access to a physical computer doesn't mean you have access to all of its data. Disks can be fully encrypted.
@_date: 2014-02-22 04:47:41
I'm not sure these would be possible if the OS is encrypted. I actually read a post on here a few months ago from some minecraft bitcoin game that almost got hacked. There was a reboot, and the owner ALMOST put in the pass, but then realized that the attacker was waiting for him to do that. I don't know how he was able to realize that there was a hack, but it was a cool story.

In memory. But how would an attacker get them without having access to the server in the first place?

i'm having trouble installing this on Linux. Ran the commands it showed, but nothing is being added to /user/local/bin. I had a development version installed before (compiled from source), but this doesn't seem to be replacing it.
Any help?
Edit: The pip installation is broken or something. I just downloaded the tar file, extracted, and ran "sudo python setup.py install". Worked fine.

Yeah that's what I meant, how do they deal with security? If the owner hires someone, he's taking a big risk. The only plausible way is to know server administration yourself? I'd be scared as hell to host my own hot wallet that serves automatic payouts without knowing much about server admin. Programming is the only thing I know.
@_date: 2013-09-23 19:26:46
Could you elaborate, please? So if he has a server running the website and another server running the payouts, it adds an extra layer to go through, but I don't see how it helps against attackers. If an attacker gets access to the front-end server, then that means he gains access to the API or whatever it is that accesses the back-end server. If he has access to this API, he can technically use it to send transactions, or at the very least, figure out which server handles these transactions and try and hack that too.
From what I understand, it's just making an additional hurdle to jump through, but assuming a hacker is good enough to get into the first, the second is not that far off.
What am I missing? Are you a server admin, by the way?
@_date: 2013-08-18 06:24:10
Really late to this discussion, but I'm just wondering: why is it that  most server security is so bad? How is it that hackers can get in to so many servers (and already have)? A really general question, I know, but surely there's a way to stop them?
@_date: 2013-09-23 18:43:30
Hey Erik, just wondering... what does it take to secure a server such as one used on SD or JD? You don't have a server admin background, correct? So how did you find someone you could trust to secure the server against hackers?
Please impart your wisdom.

Just to let you know, I tried running the testnet on a second machine and got the same problem. Again I had to delete the wallet file and start it up again.
@_date: 2013-11-05 01:08:37
Nope, it ran like normal. I solved it already, see edit.
@_date: 2013-08-18 15:54:18
Gotcha, thanks.
@_date: 2013-12-05 17:33:44
@_date: 2013-12-05 02:55:16
Yes, it did.
@_date: 2013-12-05 06:36:11
I still don't understand. I generated my wallet with Electrum. Why didn't it use 12 words from the beginning? Apparently, since it only used 11, it threw out the extra two because of the grouping. Was this a bug in the past or something?
@_date: 2013-11-07 14:24:48
I want to generate a thousand addresses for a db.
@_date: 2013-12-05 04:22:17
Blah I spent some time memorizing it -.-
How do I PM an Electrum developer? I want to make sure it's not just some feature or something first. If this is for sure a serious security issue, then I'll send my balance to another wallet and divilge the see
@_date: 2013-08-18 06:12:50
Still doesn't work =( Tried setting testnet=3, as well as setting the nodes. I don't think the nodes are the problem though. It's something local on my machine. I SHOULD be able to issue commands using bitcoind. If there were no connections, then it should show me 0 connections in getinfo.
The annoying part is that it's running in the background, but I can't stop it, since I can't connect to it. I have to kill the process to try running it again.
Any other ideas?
@_date: 2013-08-18 15:56:06
Turns out it was getting stuck on "loading wallet". Deleting the existing wallet and trying again got it working fine again.
@_date: 2013-09-23 21:53:39
Ah gotcha, thank you (and others) for the explanation.. I wonder how just-dice does it, then?
@_date: 2013-10-06 00:14:16
How are people adding messages with their transaction? Is that a feature if using blockchain.info's wallet to send funds or something?
@_date: 2013-08-18 15:55:47
Thanks a lot, Gavin. Turns out it was getting stuck on "loading wallet". Deleting the existing wallet and trying again got it working fine again.
@_date: 2013-12-05 07:00:52
Any idea how big of a security difference 9 vs 12 words makes? I've already memorized it =)
