If you actually believe that, them I'm sorry that you have no good people in your life. Probably the unhealthiest generalization you could ever make and you've clearly never grown up in abject poverty. 
Go out and see the real world, and stop surrounding yourself with terrible people.

Higher profile people have been in the game longer. Better security.

You have a very fantastical view on disaster response. Historically the majority of people come together in the event of massive natural disasters. The people obsessed with pre-empting the "raping and pillaging" with stockpiles of weapons are the ones that start shooting out of fear.
It's a defensive response to being incompatible with the rest/substantial majorities of society even in the best of times.

Less than one percent of all bitcoin miners own 88% of all bitcoins.... does this not trouble anyone?
Some government sponsored billionaire in China with a server farm  could own a substantial portion if they began early enough. Haven't seen anyone post evidence of that though.

Wealth inequality is substantially worse for BTC than regular currency, with almost all mining government sponsored in China? Yeah, that would be a problem.

You think Bitcoin is confusing to investors?
