Late or no response is a sign of being understaffed, not undertrained staff. If it was the latter, they'd respond but not actually fix the problem. I'm sure there's a bit of both with coinbase, but mostly the former.

Whales shake coins loose with massive dumps, hoping others will follow their lead. Anyone can run a bot, not anyone has 1000 coins to play with. I don't understand why institutions would have to hide that they're investing in bitcoin.

I don't think it's that simple. If there were such a thing as "proof of node" we could use that for anti-sybil instead of "proof of work". 
I don't think it's possible because you can still run a single node that answers all the queries and farms them out to 1000 fake nodes that give the correct responses but don't actually process anything themselves.

Either your scheme is simple and easily broken, or it's very complex and you might as well have just memorized the seed instead of the complex encoding scheme.
There has to be entropy somewhere. If there isn't, your wallet is vulnerable. It's as simple as that.
I am not going to argue with you further. You've been warned that your scheme is insecure.

I have yet to read a single story of a hardware wallet being hacked.
The security issue has already been solved, it's just not in widespread use. That's partially ignorance and partially high prices for hardware wallets (which will decrease significantly as they become more popular).
Edit - Sorry but it takes a hell of a lot more than "any good hacker" to extricate bitcoin from a hardware wallet. Basically if they don't get physical possession of it, there's no chance whatsoever, and even if they do it's very tricky. There's not one case of remote hacking of a hardware wallet.

The problem bitcoin solved was the "double spend" problem.
In other words, there are two conflicting transactions done at the same time. Only one of them can be valid (because you can't spend the same money twice).
Who decides which one happened "first" (and is therefore the "valid" one)?
You can't just pick any participant to decide, because this is vulnerable to a "sybil" attack. That means, one person can easily pretend to be 1000 people, because it doesn't cost them anything. Then they would almost always be chosen, and they could rewrite history anytime they wanted without it costing them anything. They could "undo" the history in which they paid you, and then spend the same coins again.
The mathematical problem is what adds real world cost to rewriting history. The effort needs to be otherwise useless. If you were going to do that work anyway (say, to process genomes, or fold proteins), then it doesn't cost you anything extra to use that effort to *also* double spend.
This way of choosing someone to resolve history conflicts by "whoever wastes real world resources", obviously seems wasteful, but that's really the only way to do it.
Yes, there is "proof of stake" where you don't need to waste real world resources, just prove that you already have some of the coins (which cost you money to acquire presumably). However that is not the same security-wise as bitcoin. With bitcoin you can join the network late, having no idea which version of history is correct, and figure it out on your own without having to trust anyone (just by looking at the version with the most work). You can't do that with proof of stake.

This is not true, bitcoin is way easier to secure than cash, as long as you treat the bitcoin secret as if it were a pile of cash. Don't leave it out where other people can take it, don't stash it somewhere and then forget where you put it.
I think a lot of bitcoin users lose their money because of this - they treat bitcoin secrets like their bank website password. They think "if I forget it or someone steals my account, there's a way to recover". No there isn't, it's just like cash. If you lose it, there is no way to recover it.
If you get a hardware wallet and put a copy of the seed in a safe deposit box, I guarantee you that it is safer than letting coinbase hold your money.
Hardware wallets are still too expensive for small amounts though.

Not *just* the IP, but you can find out which IPs have a lot of bitcoin (some of them probably reuse addresses). Then you can scan that IP for vulnerabilities or target them with phishing or malware.

The problem that I see is that coinbase is behaving as if they're unprofitable. If they were raking in cash, I can't imagine how they wouldn't have better support in place. (edit: or if they could convince investors they'd eventually be raking in cash, they'd have an influx of investment)
So far, I think coinbase users eventually get taken care of (perhaps after ridiculous delays). What's scary is the corner-cutting may also affect their security (perhaps not now, but eventually) and they could end up with another goxxing.

Too late for what? You won't be quite comfortable if you sell at 5000? If not, you didn't really invest anything at $12. 
I hate to break this to you, but the very early adopters have already sold. That's how this works, when you make so much money on bitcoin that you're set for life, you don't risk it going to zero. You sell.

Yes, disobedience is always a hard sell. I don't think you can really sell it at all in the traditional sense. You just have to lead by example. 
Make money with an unregulated business. Get access to goods and services that are otherwise blocked. Bypass capital controls. Basically, profit and let your trusted friends and family see you doing it. They'll ask. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 14:56:06
Localbitcoins? Mycelium trader? Bitsquare? You mean like those?
Even traditional exchanges are much safer if you deposit bitcoin, sell, and withdraw fiat without delay. The problem is not depositing bitcoin in an exchange, it's **leaving it there**.
Now I understand that someone needs to leave bitcoin deposited for some length of time for the exchange to have any liquidity. That's a tradeoff people just need to understand: liquidity vs security. You can make money providing liquidity, but it's insecure. People just need to adjust their bids/asks to take this into account.

WoT and keysigning parties are not that useful for online-only identities. For example my meeting you in person would not help prove that I'm talking to luke-jr, since I don't know (or care) what you look like or what your meatspace name is. A bunch of people I also don't know may say "that's luke-jr", but why should I trust them? Maybe a friend of a friend of a friend can vouch for you, but that's also a pretty weak testimonial.
I would just want to know that luke-jr today is the same as luke-jr 6 years ago (when probably no one cared to impersonate you). I need to see the messages signed by the same key as back then. Then there's the whole other issue of knowing whether the 6-year old messages are actually 6 years old. If I wasn't watching back then, and there's no trustless timestamp mechanism like the blockchain, I'm pretty much SOL. I may choose to trust timestamps in bitcointalk and reddit or whatever, and that's good enough except for the case where attackers compromise all of those.
However this technique requires having the foresight to know your identity might be attacked later, and get your name+pubkey timestamped while you're still a "nobody". Once you're well-known and a valuable target, it's too late.
@_date: 2016-08-10 13:34:43
This all totally misses the point.
Bitcoin is a censorship resistance tool. Censorship is what gives bitcoin value. Without regulations and massive amounts of people willing to obey them no matter what, bitcoin is useless. If no one was trying to seize money or block commerce, a big centralized ledger would work perfectly, and it would be a lot cheaper and faster than bitcoin.
You have to keep in mind that most people will obey no matter what. We should thank these people for their unwitting sacrifice.

"blockchian.info" constantly shows up as a top paid google result. The "simpler, more familiar user experience" directly results in scams that net enough stolen money to pay for that ad, and then some. It's insecure.
With a PGP key, it is not possible to squat on a fingerprint that is 1-character different from the target's fingerprint. It's precisely **because** the fingerprint is the output of a 1-way function that it's secure. 
Just because something is familiar doesn't mean it works.

I apologize for using the word "stupid" (but I don't think I was rude or condescending anywhere else, was I?)
What you're advocating here is called "security by obscurity", which has a history of seeming to work very well for a while, before failing catastrophically.
The weakness with your scheme is a) legit visitors to your home who might be better versed in bitcoin than burglars b) future burglars who might know more about bitcoin than today c) you are not well protected from loss (someone might throw away the paper thinking that it is useless). Multiple copies would help but that increases the risk of theft.

Coinbase does not care about your money. Coinbase cares about **coinbase's** money.
If you get hacked, that's not coinbase's problem. Therefore coinbase does nothing to ensure you don't get hacked.
Here's what they **could** do, if they cared:
Withdrawals are disabled for accounts with no 2FA. Any money deposited with 2FA enabled is available to withdraw anytime with 2FA. Money deposited with no 2FA can be withdrawn after enabling 2FA and waiting two weeks to make sure you are duly notified that 2FA has been enabled. (So that if it was a hacker and not you, you can detect it and stop the process).
Coinbase does not bother with this sort of thing because they do not care about the security of your money.

The burden of proof is on you. Go ahead and run any network service that ingests 2gb per minute, and prevent anyone from discovering your location. 


FWIW I used to be in the large block camp. Nothing would please me more than the whole world being interested in using bitcoin. However I do not believe this is a realistic goal. 
Look at the internet, and how much power it *could* grant people to make their voices heard. What content do most people actually create? Cat pics and other meaningless fluff. Face it, most people are simply not interested in empowerment.
Bitcoin currently grants power to those willing to use it. There aren't very many people willing. We should not risk losing this power completely, just to try to extend it to people who have not only expressed zero interest in it, but would actively resist it.
The good news is that hardware gets faster, on chain scaling will happen. I don't think anyone is suggesting it will remain 1mb forever. When fees get high enough there will be pressure to expand capacity and I'm sure things will move faster then. In the meantime, there's not enough demand to justify it.

I disagree. There is only one group who is selling now with no intention to buy back cheaper: miners. And they only have half as many to sell as they used to.
Bitcoin is a binary bet, it's basically either going to zero or the moon. If you take the bet, you don't get out at $600. Anyone who already made massive profits was out over two years ago. Everyone else is betting moon. 
Go ahead and sell if you think you can buy back cheaper later. It's increasingly likely you will not be able to. Everyone is going to realize this at once, FOMO will hit, and we'll blow through ATH. I am guessing by November.

There would be no way to enforce this. The encryption is used on at-rest data that doesn't need to be transmitted over a public network. So the government can't just intercept network traffic and go "aha! you're using encryption, off to jail with you". The encrypted key would never leave your computer.
Besides, there's always steganography, which would embed the encrypted message in harmless looking data, and the authorities could not detect that either.

If you have 50 BTC on your trezor, treat the written seed as if it is $29,000 in cash - or a stack of 290 $100 bills. Wherever you would put that cash, that's where you should put the seed. That's likely to be a safe deposit box or your own safe.
Nobody would ever leave $29k in cash in a pile of crap on their desk, but that seems to be what people regularly do with their bitcoin secrets. 
If people treated their bitcoin secrets like the cash-equivalent they are, bitcoin would not get lost so frequently.

Bitcoin markets itself as "be your own bank".

There is no sound bite that will sell bitcoin to the masses.
Even if they were willing to listen to you pitch it for as long as you wanted, they would *still* not care.
There's only one way to sell bitcoin - that's by you, yourself, profiting directly from bitcoin and letting your trusted friends and family see you do it. Run a business that is invisible to regulators. Buy things that can't be easily acquired otherwise. 
If you try to tell someone they can buy coffee with bitcoin, of course they don't get it. It makes no sense, it provides nothing they don't already have.

Yep, that's the takeaway. They do not give a shit. Forget about these people for now. The minority who **do** care are more than enough to sustain bitcoin.

Yeah, bitcoin sort of lays bare how imprecise our language is around money.
Sure, you can run fractional reserve with bitcoin just like you can with gold. However, given that a "promise to pay bitcoin" doesn't carry a lot of advantages over "actual bitcoin", there's not very many reasons to accept such promises.
With gold there are more reasons - gold is harder to divide and transport than paper promises. So it can be advantageous to hand it over to someone and get a promise to return it. With bitcoin, I can only presume someone would do this just to earn interest. So, the risk that the bitcoin won't be returned should be priced in to the interest rate. And I suppose another reason might be that small amounts of bitcoin are relatively expensive and slow to transfer.
Still, this is not bitcoin. It's a promise to pay bitcoin.

Bitcoin is not likely to help you, unless risks and conversion fees at both ends are significantly more attractive than the international wire fees you're paying now. That is unlikely to be the case, but it's possible.

Their new fees are like 1.5%. Hardly worth worrying about. You can always create a GDAX account and buy for no fees at all (for a limit order, or something like 0.25% for a market order). I would not recommend leaving bitcoins on coinbase but it's a perfectly reasonable place to buy them.

Right, so the oven can pay for its own electricity by using electricity to mine bitcoin! Wait...
While all this sounds cool technologically, I still don't understand what problem 21inc's ideas intended to solve.
Ok sure, autonomous devices solve a problem - your phone sells unused bandwidth, your self-driving car sells its services when you're not using it. Bitcoin definitely helps here - your car can buy its own gas. However 21inc seems to think bitcoin *mining* helps here. I honestly don't see how. Mining may be a convenient way to acquire tiny amounts of bitcoin, but there are very limited use cases for amounts that small.

I am getting weary of all these explanations of bitcoin that completely avoid discussing censorship resistance and disobedience of authority.
Ok, so there's no trusted third party. Why should anyone give fuck about that? Why should they not trust those third parties, that they've been trusting their whole life, and seemingly no ill effects have come of it?
Why should they disobey authority? Why should they take back their money from the control of a bank? Why should they buy things that Visa and Paypal do not allow? Why should they engage in unregulated commerce? 
If speakers cannot make this case, they shouldn't be speaking about bitcoin. They're painting it as a curious but mostly useless technology.

If you feel like you can't tolerate the risk, you should definitely sell for a lower-risk asset (like gold).
I think bitcoin's risk is lower now than it's ever been, but it's hard to know.
I think you are making a mistake though, if you think bitcoin ever had a chance of being a mainstream method of commerce. It's a censorship resistance tool, most people just can't stomach disobeying authority. Now, that doesn't mean bitcoin's unit of account can't become mainstream. Especially if the dollar loses its dominance, pricing things in bitcoin seems like a possibility. 
However hardly anyone *can* hold actual bitcoin (due to scaling issues), and hardly anyone would want to anyway. More likely they'll deal in promissory notes (like you get when you deposit bitcoin in an exchange). Those can be inflated, seized, etc, but the vast majority of the population could not care less about these things.
Bitcoin won't die due to lack of interest though, it's got a solid niche.

Bitcoin defines "belongs" as "whoever has the private key".
This is well known and well understood. If you don't want what currently "belongs" to you to "belong" to someone else, then **don't let them get the private key**.
I realize this can be difficult but at least the rules are simple and don't involve human judgment. I, and many in the bitcoin community, prefer to keep it that way.

With 20gb blocks, it would be impossible to use bitcoin at all in a censorship-resistant manner. 
I think we should stop dreaming of the whole world using bitcoin. The vast majority of people don't care about censorship resistance, and never will. They will continue to accept promises as payment no matter what bitcoin does. 
Bitcoin needs to be able to run on untraceable connections like Tor.  If someone wants to develop a compromise between capacity and censorship resistance, that's fine, but it shouldn't be on-chain payments.

Even without a passphrase, there's still the pin. In all the seizures I'm aware of, plausible deniability never even came into play. The police got the keys without having to extract any information directly from the suspect. If he'd had a trezor with a PIN, the police would have had to at least force the suspect to give up the PIN.
If he'd left a token amount in the passwordless account, he could then deny that there was any other account, or claim he had forgotten the password. Of course, he could claim he forgot the PIN too, but it's a little more plausible if the police are able to seize *something* rather than nothing.

Seems to me that designing a cryptocurrency without built-in replay protection is a bad idea. The assumption is "there are no forks, or if there are, the forkers are required to implement replay protection, it's not our problem."
But it *is* our problem, since forks *can* happen, and replays can go in either direction. 
I don't think there's any way around having to specify in a transaction which fork it's intended for (if you don't care about a replay - likely because it's not replayable, you don't have to specify). 
I'm not sure exactly *what* you would specify, I guess a block hash that's required to be in the chain at the point the tx is included. I'm sure that would bloat the blockchain and make it harder to verify, but perhaps it's a relatively small cost.
@_date: 2016-08-26 21:28:55
It's not the forking that damaged its reputation. It's the shenanigans that led up to the fork, that demonstrated not only that the community doesn't give a shit about the values they had claimed were important to them, but also that the smart contract platform itself is difficult to use properly.

How could that even be done? Everyone would need to individually sign, and as soon as they broadcast it, it could be replayed on the other fork. Miners would have to just guess which one was the "intended" one still, wouldn't they?
@_date: 2016-08-19 18:13:37
How's that any better than just plain old digital signatures? 
If I want to tie all my digital identities together in one single identifier, I can use a PGP key. No matter what system I use, somehow I have to communicate which ID is actually mine, as you already admit. 
What does the blockchain do here, aside from allowing people to cybersquat on short and easy-to-remember names? In the end, the people you actually want to communicate with *won't* have easy-to-remember names - they'll all be taken. So you will have to write them down anyway, and so you might as well write down (or qr-code scan, or whatever) a PGP key fingerprint.

Well, the tech intro stuff is fine. It's the use cases he outlines, they are far too meek and intended for broad appeal, which is exactly what you don't need bitcoin for.
The example he gave was land records in Honduras. There's no case for censorship resistance there. Men with guns are still the ultimate authority in real estate. Land as an asset is still someone else's obligation - to physically defend the land rights. Bitcoin works because it is NOT someone else's obligation.
He's trying to appeal to universal morality and that's the exact opposite of what bitcoin is for. Bitcoin is for the *minority* morality. It's about resisting powerful entities' efforts to stop certain behavior. Bitcoin itself makes no moral judgment.
Bitcoin can resist efforts to stop all kinds of behavior ranging from majority-approved (buying weed) to nearly universally reviled (murder for hire). 
What bitcoin is NOT good for are things that nobody is trying to censor. Buying coffee, cars, land, basically anything that's completely legal and morally approved.

Sure, banks would have no special authority to make loans. But they do already have a lot of infrastructure in place to judge credit-worthiness.
There will be no such thing as bitcoin loans to anonymous parties, since there will be no incentive to pay back the loan. I suppose there may eventually be some form of digital collateral, but so far only bitcoin could serve as collateral, which kind of defeats the purpose of a bitcoin loan.

Wait a minute, will all your physical storage (laptop) get stolen or not? If so, then this is the scenario where I said a brain wallet makes sense. 
You have to weigh risk of theft against risk of loss. The risk of loss with a brain wallet is quite high compared to other options. Memorizing 24 words is of course possible, but forgetting them is also possible. 
My point is that if you go with the "high risk of loss" option it should *only* be in circumstances where there's very high risk of theft. There are few such situations in reality today.

I'm no expert but I'd be willing to bet a large sum that this will not work. If it did, we'd have a solution for sybil attacks. I don't think there are any anti-sybil algorithms aside from those that force participants to use real-world resources. That's exactly what PoW and PoS do.
When you think about it, it makes sense. If you are talking to two people on the internet, how can you prove they're not the same real-life person? You can't. You can only discourage people from acting as 1000 internet people by forcing them to burn money for each identity.

That has nothing to do with it.
The reason "brainwallets" are insecure is because they have low entropy, they are created with the express purpose of being "easy to remember" which requires low entropy.

No. The entire purpose of bitcoin is to disobey authority.
Bitcoin makes no judgment about **which** authority you wish to disobey. You may simply want to disobey the central bank, refusing to let them inflate away your savings. Or you may wish to disobey the drug enforcement agencies by buying things they don't want you to buy.
Of course authorities will always point to the use case that people find the most objectionable. It obscures bitcoin's usefulness.

Banks have the legal system to punish cheating, all they need is a system whereby if someone cheats, there's cryptographic proof of the cheating.
A centralized system is perfectly capable of doing this. All it has to do is sign and publish its transactions, anyone subscribing to them can verify they're correct, and they'd have proof of cheating if they're not correct. Subscribers can compare notes, if they want to ensure that the central system is telling the same story to everyone.
If the banks want a system where cheating is prevented (vs just detected), then they might as well just use bitcoin. They don't realize this yet, of course. It'll take many years of failed experiments before it starts to dawn on them.

I never stated otherwise, only that your 300,000 number is wrong. That's the upper bound, not the actual supply.
Imagine the market is just you and me, and I sell you 1 btc for $100 and then you sell it back to me for $100.01, and then I sell it back to you for $100, and you sell it back to me for $100.01, that's 4 sales. How many bitcoins are there for sale? Still just one! If 100 potential buyers show up, they all have to bid for that one coin. They'll have 4 chances to bid, but if someone buys it for $101, and puts it up for sale again at $50,000, then that's the price. There are no 3 other coins to bid on.

This isn't even a question of UX. I don't doubt that fingerprints are bad UX. 
There's two ways to build good UX: 
1) Build a secure system that has perhaps poor UX, and then add the 'easy' insecure mode on top of it.
2) Build the easy mode from the beginning, with no way to add a secure mode on top of it.
I don't see how you can defend passing around blockstack id's electronically. It's insecure and unnecessary. Pass around fingerprints, and if the user wants "easy", then just display the data to them as the blockstack ID. That way, there is still a secure id "behind" the easy one on their machine. 
Once you start passing around blockstack ids, it's too late, there's no secure id behind it.
The only possible reason to ever use a short name is when you're not communicating electronically. When you find out by word of mouth about some great new website, and you manually type in a dns name, and get it wrong, no big deal right? Except for some sites where it **is** a big deal. The proportion of those sites are increasing all the time, and that trend is never going to reverse. 
I don't know why it's so hard for people to admit that the era of easy-to-remember names is ending. That only worked when nothing was at stake. It certainly doesn't work at all in a bitcoin-enabled world, which I why I question a bitcoin-related technology that tries to prolong this dying method.

The main question to me is, will miners shut down and sell their operation, or will they continue to mine at an unrealized loss (at current prices) holding the bitcoin in hopes the price catches up?
I imagine liquidating a large mining operation isn't easy, it doesn't look like this is going to happen. If it were, it would be planned in advance (since the halving event is well known) and would probably be starting to happen well ahead of the event (whoever liquidates first will likely get a better price).
On the other hand, I'm not sure these large miners have enough cash on hand to operate for very long, without selling the coins they are mining.
It'll be real interesting to see what happens. If 2012 is any indication, we will not see a drop in difficulty, which points to an eventual rise in price. However things will not necessarily play out the same way this time.

Sure, with a cryptosystem, anyone would be able to verify that "all eligible votes add up to the claimed number". And it would likely be impossible to block an eligible voter from voting, if they have their own device and internet connection (a big "if"). However the question of "who's eligible" would still be left up to the same people who screwed up yesterday's election. The manipulation would just shift entirely to purging voters from the eligible list, or adding people that do not exist.

That should not be necessary since the PIN entry has exponential backoff. The attacker would only get ~15 attempts in the first day, ~18 in the first week, 23 in the first year, about 26 in his whole lifetime.
Edit: although honestly I'm not sure how the trezor keeps track of time while it's unplugged. It may be possible to attempt PINs faster than above if you powercycle it after a few attempts each time.
Edit2: ok, the trezor stores the number of failed attempts internally, so if you unplug it an plug it back in, that just makes the delay even longer. 
Edit3: if the attack you're worried about is actually physical recovery of the key (via opening and probing the device etc), then the PIN doesn't protect you at all from that anyway- an attacker would not bother ever trying to brute force it and wouldn't trip the "wipe" guard that you're proposing.

What exactly is the problem? Current bitcoin would have a serious problem as a minority mining power, but it's possible to create a fork that isn't so easily attackable with the "high and dry scenario". (That's where a powerful miner pumps up your difficulty and then leaves, and you're left with very very long block times). It's pretty easy to solve that. It results in less-predictable inflation rates, but it's not that big a deal (bitcoin's inflation rate is not completely known either - average block time hasn't been exactly 10 minutes for a long time, if ever).

There's little relationship between tx volume and supply.
Edit: if you are referring to exchange volume, you're still wrong. If I buy and sell the same 1 btc ten times in a day, that's still just 1 btc of supply. The supply is what's for sale at a given moment, not what is sold over the course of a day.

It's an interesting thought experiment to estimate when that will happen. Inflation is slowing, but rate of coin loss is also slowing due to increased value. I'm guessing after 3 more halvings (inflation of 0.5% per year) losses will match inflation.

I don't see what KYC has to do with anything. Not that it will stop regulators from punishing exchanges anyway.
The exchanges customers already have KYC requirements, so channels and payments directly between the exchange and customer are fine. Even customer to customer is fine, routed through the exchange (coinbase already does this, with off-chain payments).
What about payments routed through the exchange between two non-customers? Well, KYC doesn't seem to apply there either. The exchange sees it as one customer sending to another. 
Let's say Alice and Bob are customers, and Eve and Mallory are not.
Eve -&gt; Alice -&gt; Coinbase -&gt; Bob -&gt; Mallory is the actual payment.
Coinbase doesn't know that, they only see Alice -&gt; Coinbase -&gt; Bob because of the onion routing. If Alice is sending payments on behalf of Eve, KYC regulations should apply to her, not coinbase.
Of course, that would be a nightmare to enforce, and so I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if regulators just clamp down on exchanges even though it makes no logical sense.

Yes, but that's true today also. 
What should theoretically happen with miners who have cheap power, is that they continue to scale up (edit: driving up difficulty) until they're making a small profit margin. That should have happened already.
In reality, all available cheap or free power in the world hasn't been redirected to bitcoin mining yet, so there's still growing room.

I don't think there was much they could do about it from a technical perspective.
Someone has to have access to the hot wallet, and that person can steal funds.
From Erik's story, it sounded like they failed to detect a backdoor which was installed by someone physically present at the machine. There's not really any good technical way to prevent that either, but having employees not leave their machines unlocked and unattended would have made the backdoor a lot harder to set up.

Use google, for example "tether bitcoin correlation", look at the images tab. There's several graphs there comparing bitcoin price and tether issuance.
You can see the places where tether was issued, and sometimes the price went up immediately after, sometimes it went down. There is no correlation whatsoever, unless you mean over the long term. But of course that could easily be getting the causation backward - if bitcoin and crypto got popular (and we have every reason to think it did), we'd expect tether issuance to go up because of that.

That's referring to prices. Alts follow bitcoin's price (to some degree).

I don't believe LN routers "transmit money", in any real sense. 
If you allow LN routers to fall under this definition, then it would be so broad as to include every bitcoin full node as well. After all, bitcoin nodes receive and forward on-chain bitcoin transactions (even those they are not party to at all). And you could also include every TCP/IP router between nodes as well - those routers are also transmitting bitcoin transactions.
I think it's pretty clear the regulations will not be applied to tcp/ip routers, so I do not see why LN routers are any different.

You're seriously asking me, if my thought experiment with a market of 2 people is realistic? I was only making the point that the same coin is traded multiple times per day. Yes, that part is realistic. Fees are low or zero depending on the exchange, so there is still plenty of opportunity for profit by selling the same coin multiple times per day. What is the average multiple across all exchanges? I have no idea, no one really knows. But you're stating that it's 1, and that's simply not true.
To get a better idea of the actual supply, look at the order books. For example, bitstamp's got 2300 coins for sale right now between the current price and $443. However that's not accurate either, since sell walls are often used to send signals to the market, they're not actually for sale (the "seller" intends to pull the wall out as the market price approaches it). So again this is an upper bound. 
@_date: 2016-04-12 10:27:39

This is impossible for anyone to answer right now.
I mean, practically speaking, LN routing nodes are not money transmitters - they do not have custody of other people's money, ever. It's not possible for the transmission of money to stop, even temporarily, at a routing node.
However, the government may decide money transmitter laws apply anyway, they do all kinds of boneheaded things, especially with respect to cryptocurrency.

There was no reason whatsoever to built it on top of bitcoin, except to appeal to people who already had bitcoin. And even then it wasn't much of an appeal: "let changetip control your money and hope that you'll be able to withdraw it". That's not something that normally appeals to bitcoiners. They were into it because they hoped it would bring in a large number of new bitcoin users, and it didn't. Which is not really at all surprising.

You're assuming people who start with tether must make market orders to buy bitcoin. Not true, they can do limit orders at lower prices. So it is entirely possible for price to decline while tether issuance goes up. Doesn't seem likely to have that negative correlation for very long, though. At some point either the tether market buys or exits back to the banking system.

@_date: 2018-01-24 04:19:01
You call it "promoting spending", I call it "limiting your choices".
The purpose of money is so that you can trade something (goods, labor) and decide later what you want to get in return. 
I'd say that any money that limits how long you have to decide, is bad money. You should have literally forever. If you die before you decide, then your heirs decide.
So the fact that bitcoin has a limited supply is a feature, one that literally everyone wants. No one wants to have choices taken away. When you have choices taken away, you end up buying something that wasn't ideally what you wanted. How is that good for the economy, when everyone ends up with a lot of crap they didn't really want?
The "deflationary spiral" does not exist with bitcoin. Think of the 21 million bitcoins as "all the money". As the economy grows and your share of "all the money" remains constant, your purchasing power increases. This puts a brake on the speed that the economy can grow. I would argue this is not a bad thing - think of all the times the economy grew too fast - the dotcom and housing bubbles for example. Both resulted in lots of useless things being built - worthless dotcom businesses, unoccupied housing. There's no way you can argue that building useless things is "good" for an economy - it would be better if people only invested in things that they knew would beat holding an appreciating currency. Things that people are sure that they need.
Edit: we already have proof that people do buy things even knowing they can buy more of it later. TVs and computers, for example. If they just wait a year, that same TV or computer will cost maybe 60-70% of what it does now. And yet, people still buy them even knowing this - because the alternative is not having a computer or TV. People buy them because they really want them. Why shouldn't everything be like that?
@_date: 2018-01-28 14:42:03
No you can't, that's what I'm saying.
Without the full records from the exchange, the IRS cannot tell anything at all.
For example: I buy bitcoin at $100 but don't withdraw it from the exchange until the price reaches $1000. Then I deposit it back at the exchange when the price is $900, but don't sell it until the price is $10,000. By blockchain data alone it looks like I've had a 10% loss when in reality I've had a 100x gain.
Edit: I think the key piece of information here is that blockchain transactions happen upon deposit and withdraw, NOT on buy/sell. Leaving bitcoin on the exchange long enough for the price to change significantly, means that blockchain data will not give even remotely accurate price information by which to judge gains/losses.

You're just making wild accusations here. 
Yes, it's possible that tether's claims that it's not 1:1 backed is not true, but it's also entirely possible that it *is* true.
I definitely think there's reason to be cautious with tether, because there's no proof of reserve. However there's also no smoking gun, nor is there even any plausible theory of what illegal scheme bitfinex could be trying to pull here.
The idea that bitfinex would create a public cryptographic proof of their fraud is quite frankly, laughable. How exactly do you think they plan to avoid prison if it turns out there was never any money in their bank? 
If bitfinex wanted to steal bitcoin, they could have done it without tether, and done it in a way that would be a lot more difficult to prove later. Look at mtgox, still nobody knows what the fuck happened there. 
The truth is that tether would be a really stupid way to commit fraud, and unless someone can point out how exactly this fraud is supposed to work, this is all just conspiracy theory nuttery.

Because starting an altcoin would start with massive inflation and chaos. If I expect my fork to take the majority of hashpower (or even a chance of that), there's no way I would start a new chain. 
The advantage of forking is that coins are already distributed.
The "problem" you mention of the name "bitcoin" isn't a problem at all, because whether it's a fork or alt, you can always choose a new name. It's only a problem if both forks fight over the name. An alt could also call itself "bitcoin", that would be just as confusing.

Doesn't make sense to use another phone as a backup, just back up the 2fa secret onto a piece of paper. Unless you are worried that you'd need your account access between the time you lose your phone and when you get access to any other phone.

@_date: 2018-01-20 00:00:13


Well, that is not necessarily a problem. A $2000 tx paying $10 fee is only paying 0.5%.
However I don't see why channels and routes will not grow in capacity to serve whatever demand is made for those payments. Of course a lot of factors affect what price people are willing to pay for routing and what nodes will expect to be paid. But I think that if no other node has enough liquidity, and the user would otherwise have no other choice but to pay on-chain fees, that is a big opportunity for someone to add a new node with a lot of liquidity, and serve that demand. They could charge some significant fraction of what on-chain fees are, and users would pay it because they're still saving money. And then of course competition would set in until some equilibrium is reached. I'm sure at first the network will be full of naive and non-optimal setups, but since it's competitive I expect more efficient setups to emerge pretty quickly.

This is just a specific instance of the "bribing miners" attack, I don't see anything special about it.
You could also bribe miners to mine empty blocks. In theory they won't take the ChainAnchor bribe nor the empty block bribe for the same reason: it destroys the value of the product they are mining.
Or put a different way, the bribe would have to be pretty large - so high that the attacker would likely be better off buying mining equipment himself.

I've run c-lightning and lost money due to bugs in the code. I mean, it's not strictly "lost" - I still have the keys. But there is no way within the software itself to recover the funds. I would have to roll my own code to do it.
Even though there are nodes running on mainnet, it's still a long way from ready for mainstream use. From what I saw, the software is prepared for some adverse conditions but there are a lot more that it simply doesn't handle yet.
I believe it'll get there, I think people who are technically competent enough to run their own bitcoin node can probably use LN comfortably from a desktop in about six months.
A fully functional mobile wallet that automatically handles channel management (and abstracts it away so the user doesn't even need to see it in normal operation) and is actually reliable, that's a much bigger task, I'd say 2 years away minimum.
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:45:33
It's way too early to draw that conclusion. However I personally don't expect the topology to change too much. There will be well-connected nodes if/when exchanges join the network, but that's hardly "hub/spoke" (where everyone is connected to a single central node).
It will be decentralized "enough" - if you aren't satisfied connecting to a single well-connected node, just open another channel until you are able to get what you want. I imagine a small number of channels (3?) would be satisfactory for nearly ever user.
@_date: 2018-01-09 01:24:46

I don't think this applies to a majority hashpower miner. If he was rewriting from genesis, he could use 2009 timestamps similar to the original blocks, even if he found 2016 blocks in a single minute. The node software has no way to know when they were truly created. 
I think the only timestamp checking nodes can do is make sure they're not in the future, and that a block isn't timestamped long before its predecessor. That keeps things orderly outside a 51% attack scenario.

$13.5 trillion worth of value wants to pay someone to hold their money. Either because they have no choice (cash is illegal or otherwise not an option) or because cash costs more to protect and store than the cost of someone else holding it (plus the counterparty risk).
Bitcoin solves both these problems: cash becomes an option (regardless of what any authority says, because they cannot stop you or even know whether you hold bitcoin), and safely storing bitcoin costs essentially nothing.
This market (the $13.5T) is the bare minimum that bitcoin can expect to capture in the near future. FYI that equates to about $800,000 per coin.

Humans' default mode is laziness and obedience. Don't do any unnecessary thinking as this just wastes energy (perhaps a vestige of when food was scarce and so was energy to run your brain). If someone in a position of authority claimed to have already done the thinking, you were better off not repeating the effort yourself. In prehistoric times, that authority was a member of your small tribe and more likely trustworthy than an authority in a country of 100m+ people.
Now that food is no longer scarce, the default mode is clearly self-defeating. That changed too recently for evolution to adjust. Poor people (in America at least) are fat and it would serve them well in multiple ways to stop trusting authority and think for themselves. But generally they don't, so they get told to do whatever keeps them subservient, and they do it.
Let's be 100% clear: bitcoin will not change this. There is an underclass of lazy thinkers that bitcoin will not help one iota. Even if they hold bitcoin they'll practically give it away to any authority that tells them to.
Bitcoin almost entirely benefits those that overcome that default mode, the thoughtful disobedient. Authorities will continue to fleece the lazy forever. In fact, I think the lazy are actually becoming a higher percentage of the population (they have more children, as seen in Idiocracy). (edit: so maybe evolution will never change this default mode, as it considers survival and reproduction as success, regardless of quality of life)
Mostly you should just worry about yourself. Most people who think and disobey are already doing it, and will be receptive to bitcoin. Those who don't are very unlikely to change, so you'd be wasting time on them.

NLP isn't going to change anything, as natural language doesn't do the job of programming. All the processing in the world isn't going to tell the computer what the person MEANT, only what he said. Programming is hearing the words of the customer and giving him what he wants, not what he asked for. It is basically as far into the realm of understanding humans as you can get. Automating programming tasks is precisely the same problem as writing software for a customer, only difference is the customer is a programmer.

I'm a programmer. My job will be the very last to be automated. Most people wouldn't expect that to be the case, but it is. Programming is not doing logical steps that a computer can do.

I think DCA is a good strategy as long as it's a period of several months to a year. Any more than that, and I believe you'll end up with less bitcoin than if you'd just bought as soon as you could. 
Therefore if you cannot save up enough cash in less than a year to invest in bitcoin the amount that you want, borrowing the rest is a perfectly reasonable thing to do. Assuming of course, that even if bitcoin does not perform well, you can still afford to pay back the loan.

I do expect a backlash at some point, especially by the US government. However I think time is on bitcoin's side. No matter how violent the backlash, bitcoin will infiltrate the government until the ban can no longer be sustained. It's just too superior as money for the existing powers to resist it.
Just like the US banned citizens from holding gold in the 30's, they might attempt to just steal bitcoin from the population. I suspect that's going to be very difficult. You can search someone's house for gold, but you can't search their brain for private keys. It's incredibly easy for people to just take their bitcoin wealth out of the US and never return.
I admit though, a severe backlash might last decades before it collapses. I think that's pretty unlikely. I think the existing powers are going to realize what every smaller potential attacker has realized: it's more profitable to cooperate with bitcoin than fight it. The only people who don't profit a lot are the last ones in, and it's too late for them to fight it anyway.

Bitcoin mining doesn't consume energy, that's just incidental. It consumes VALUE. 
Improvements in mining efficiency are irrelevant, it'll just end up requiring more calculations to destroy the same value, such that the mining reward in bitcoin is roughly equal in value to the energy consumed.
As for the idea that bitcoin will eventually consume 100% of the world's energy, that's absurd. Energy is a scarce resource. If bitcoin starts consuming a significant amount of it, it will drive up the price of energy. Then less energy will need to be consumed, because it's the value of the energy that matters, not the number of joules.

Nobody said anything about them becoming a LN node.
I'll spell it out for you:
Miners can just keep right on mining, and LN will bring them more profits. While it's true each participant will be paying fewer mining fees overall, there will be many more participants (right now many txs on the chain belong to the same parties, with LN there will be far fewer txs per user, and more users).
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:57:07
It is a censorship resistant network, there are no privileged positions, no trusted third parties. So you tell me, what can businesses possibly offer to the network? NOTHING. They have nothing to offer.
Now of course, there is a wider world outside the censorship resistant network - that's coinbase's reason to exist. They interface with the legacy system that requires licensing and tons of money to even get off the ground.
*Inside* the network, however, businesses have no way to profit, because there is no regulatory body protecting them from being eaten alive by informal competition.
LN is being developed by precisely who it should be - the people who want it. The community. There's no possible way to profit from building LN or any other off chain solution.
This stuff about "blockstream is deliberately holding down block sizes so they can sell their L2 solution" is conspiracy nut bullshit. If Blockstream controls it, it's not censorship resistant and so it's irrelevant to the crypto space.

I can only answer the last point - the "bank run" scenario is not an issue. The reason is that the "justice" transaction can be replaced with higher-fee versions to get in first, but the "cheat" transaction (an old state in the channel) cannot increase its fees. So the justice txs should always get in first. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:22:40


We just did roughly 2x by adding segwit, which still most people (and companies) are not bothering to use.
What that says to me, is that fees are not high. If everyone thought they were that painful, they could have cut them in half just by using segwit. And yet, 80%+ of the current transactions aren't using it.
I think wide adoption of segwit is a prerequisite for considering new block size increases.

Best I can recommend is buying a small amount of btc, non kyc, using cash in person (via paxful or mycelium local trader or whatever the latest hotness is for that). Then deposit it at bitmex or bybit or deribit, and do a leveraged buy to get the rest. Worst case you get rekt by a price decline and have to repeat the in-person purchase and deposit more. As long as bitcoin price goes up eventually, and you don't have any gaps in your exposure, you won't lose anything except some fees which should be reasonable.
You can even continue to buy more with cash-in-person, and reduce your position on bitmex by the same amount.
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:55:37
The whole reason people like bitcoin is precisely because it's "not backed".
Here's what "backed" means today: the central bank manages the supply, often badly. Individual banks are deputized to spy on everything you do, on behalf of the federal government, and if they don't like anything you do, you lose access to banking.
So yeah, "not backed" is exactly what we want.

This is absolutely not true. It's quite feasible to run scams even assuming honest arbitrators.
If the fiat transfer is not verifiable, how is the arbitrator supposed to know how to rule? He can't, he just guesses. The scammer will manufacture "evidence" to get a ruling in his favor: photos of supposed receipts etc.
Similarly if the fiat side is reversible, the scammer will simply reverse and there's nothing the arbitrator can do by then because he's already released the bitcoin.
And then there's the whole "random arbitrator" thing, even if there's some sybil protection, you have no idea who those arbitrators are, or what proportion of them are honest.


The fact that only small sums are supported or recommended is an admission of insecurity. The only reason bisq works at all is because the amounts are too small to attract good scammers. 
I suppose if those small amounts is all you want, have at it, but that's not good enough to even think about replacing centralized exchanges.

And nontechnical passengers don't get to choose between Boeing and Crazy Joe's airliner design. There is only Boeing.

General AI basically does get rid of all labor. Of course, there's the question of whether general AI can be created that willingly just works for someone else. But assuming it does, I expect it will be largely free - equivalent to today's open source software (you still need material things to make it work, which actually are scarce, but the software itself costs ~0 to replicate).

I see it just the opposite. I think this is good for the long term usability, to have people grabbing up bitcoin **ahead** of its scaling to usefulness as everyday money. Lightning network should expand the scale quite a bit, and there are other optimizations coming, not to mention block sizes will increase again at some point.
I mean, if it were some gold-like element that everyone thought would be used as money eventually, people would be digging it up and storing it away even if they couldn't use it yet. I see nothing wrong with that.
I see bitcoin going after gold first, then savings accounts (which are touched maybe 1-2x per month max, instead of multiple times a day like a debit card). The last thing it should be trying to compete with is Visa.

You should ask yourself, "what does 'backed by' mean?"
You'll realize that what "backed by" means, is that someone promises to give you something in return. The US dollar, for example, is backed by absolutely nothing. No one promises to give you a certain amount of gold for a dollar. That ended in the early 70s. "Backed by the government" is meaningless, because it only applies as long as people have faith in that government. People have faith in bitcoin precisely because they DON'T have faith in government to properly manage monetary policy (and for good reason, see Venezuela, Zimbabwe, etc).
You might argue that bitcoin's power consumption is "wasteful", but before you do that, compare its environmental impact to the system it replaces: gold mines, vaults, countless bank buildings and offices, armored trucks, payment system offices and infrastructure, etc etc.

There are risks, but I believe they are vastly overstated. I think the current valuation is roughly correct. It used to be woefully undervalued. 
It may still be undervalued, I see no reason to think Lightning Network won't deliver cheap instant and still censorship resistant payments that you (and a lot of other people) have been craving. If it does deliver, $100k is the minimum value of bitcoin. So if there's really a good chance it will deliver, fair value today is closer to $50k in my opinion.

I'm not bluffing, but the conditions under which I'd liquidate don't exist yet. There has to be some better alternative. There's no other chain right now I can "vote" for with my wallet. I think it's clear that miners intend to 51% attack a large-block chain (by refusing to mine larger blocks). This just happens by default since small blocks are valid to a large-block node, but not vice versa.
Miners must be forced to choose, they can't be allowed to mine blocks that are valid on both types of nodes. If that is allowed, then miners can attack with zero cost. The solution is a minor protocol change that makes blocks from the small-block network invalid on the large-block network.

It's not manipulable in the same ways. I think the majority of gold is in the hands of custodians (who can inflate and pretend to have more real gold than they do). That is not true of bitcoin - it's relatively easy and cheap to secure yourself.
Any currency or good is prone to the type of manipulation you're talking about - large holders putting or taking large amounts into/out of the market. The larger the market, the more difficult this is. Bitcoin is only vulnerable because it's small.

You are completely missing my point.
I'm not talking about the case where coinbase loses your bitcoin. I'm talking about the case where SOMEONE logs in to their site with your credentials, transfers the bitcoin out, and then you later complain that it wasn't you. Do you know what coinbase does in that case? Believe it or not, they tell you to fuck off. You know why? Because they don't know whether the person who did the transfer was you or not.
It's not quite the same with a bank. ATMs have cameras and a physical location. If they get a withdrawal 1000 miles away from where you previously used your card, and the photo doesn't look like you, it's probably not you. In order for you to trick them, you'd have to travel a long way, which costs money. Bitcoin withdrawals from the other side of the world cost nothing. Just use VPN or Tor.
A custodial bitcoin account is FAR FAR more dangerous to a user than having a hardware wallet. It's trivial to phish someone with a fake coinbase site. You can't phish a hardware wallet user because there's no bank for you to pretend to be. You can phish as some merchant he should pay perhaps, but that doesn't let you empty his account.

You're taking too narrow a view. You think that miners could get away with refusing to include transactions in blocks indefinitely?

Is there a brief explanation somewhere of how sidechains actually improve scalability? It seems to be just an unoptimized partitioning of the network. At first blush that doesn't appear to help much. If coins on all sidechains are of equal value, wouldn't it be equally likely that I'd receive payment on *any* of them, and therefore have to keep up with *all* of them? The amount of data my computer would have to process would be the same as if there were no partitioning at all. Either that, or someone on another partition would have to move his coins to *my* partition, which would be expensive. I would think that one of the freedoms we want is to have everyone on a level playing field, which even efficient partitioning (based on past behavior) doesn't really solve - if Alice and Bob are "near", then they can transact cheaply and Charlie (who is "distant") is at a disadvantage when marketing to Bob or Alice.

Bitwage *is* a bank. They're part of the banking networks (that's how they receive fiat transfers for you). Just like other banks, they can seize your money or deny you access to it at any time.
The only difference between them and other banks is that they're bitcoin friendlier, and they offer an exchange service. They're just as regulated as any other. 
There's no substitute for being paid directly in bitcoin. A better service than bitwage, would be at the other end. A bank where companies can pay their employees via traditional bank transfers OR bitcoin conversion. Good luck to anyone who wants to start that business though, between regulators and complete indifference from companies, I can't see that getting off the ground anytime soon.

You're ignoring a major reason there's a premium when buying bitcoin on LBC. It's not market inefficiency, it's increased privacy and (arguably) security.

I don't understand why this is an irreversible decision.
Let's say we let blocks get large - so that it takes a $500/month internet connection and a $10,000 machine to keep up. And then it turns out mining gets very centralized for whatever reason (more so than today which seems very unlikely to me), and we see that we went too far, blocks need to be smaller.
What stops us from just hardforking back to smaller blocks? 
What bothers me about the small block argument is that it is basically a self-attack, just to try to avoid a larger external attack that may not ever materialize. If it were not possible to recover from that external attack, I might understand the concern. But I see no reason to believe recovery is impossible.

One of bitcoin's most important properties is how it's created - nobody can create it without obligatory and expensive proof of work.
Once you go off-chain, that property is gone. The world will proliferate with bitcoin promissory notes, just like it has with gold promissory notes. 
In the end bitcoin would just be literally digital gold - where anyone can create cheap and easily traded promissory notes, but the real thing is expensive to acquire and trade. The vast majority of the world population would be priced out.
Bitcoin would still be an incremental improvement over gold, but not as revolutionary as it set out to be. Granted, it's simply not possible with today's hardware, to put all the world's transactions in the blockchain. It may never be possible (since the amount of world transactions would probably rise to eat up all available space).
I think this "damned if you do, damned if you don't" issue is fairly well understood, the challenge is finding the sweet spot between "nobody can afford transactions" and "nobody can afford to run a node".
Mining centralization has already happened. No amount of shifting toward "nobody can afford transactions" will improve it. On the other hand, a large shift toward "nobody can afford to run a node" would not make mining any more centralized.
@_date: 2015-06-14 20:28:40
I've read his proposal and discussed it with him at length. I think you do not understanding what he is proposing. Under his scheme, as a full node you deal in information others don't have, and also in relaying information for others. I'm not sure how you conclude that miners will necessarily have a negative net income from those activities. That is far from clear. Even if it were, I don't know how you can conclude that miners fixed costs will be anywhere close to 10 percent. I think that is wildly inaccurate, personally.

Policy is always neutral because bitcoin is voluntary consensus. (edit: I should have said, policy is always under your control, may not be neutral but it's always what you want). If you and some friends want a new policy, you code it up and BAM, you have a new policy. Of course the flip side is that you can't force anyone else to adopt your policy, so you end up on your own fork. That is not something to be feared. If you want to avoid being attacked by big miners, you can make trivial changes to the hashing algorithm. It really troubles me that so many bitcoin developers see policy as being dictated by the majority of hashpower. 
When you evaluate what money you want to use, the amount of hashpower behind it is far from the top consideration. It counts for something, sure, but it's not going to stop people from leaving to a lower-adoption fork, if that fork is otherwise better money.

It is only with some kind of tortured logic that bitcoin can be considered intellectual property.
You do not generate bitcoins with your intellect. It's not like writing a book or taking a photo. As has already been shown, manual mining (pen and paper) is so slow that it generates zero bitcoins (or as close to zero as makes any difference).
@_date: 2015-12-01 16:29:32
They're not trying to scale, they're proposing bullshit layers on top of bitcoin that have no chance of ever succeeding.
LN is not a serious solution IMO. The block size has to be large enough so that a) you can afford to enter a channel b) you can afford to leave and open another channel if your current hub misbehaves and c) you can afford to just cash out and hold raw bitcoin if you don't have any other hubs you want to deal with at the moment.  Throw a few billion people all competing for block space and you'll see they simply don't fit. Fees will just increase until most of them are priced out. LN doesn't solve the problem. 
What solves the problem is making blocks much larger than they are today and sacrificing the ability to run a mining operation on Tor (which no one does today anyway). This is going to happen whether developers like it or not. 
Just because you can run a full node doesn't mean you will. Why would you run a full node if you can't receive any transactions on the blockchain?
I'm not proposing that we let blocks get so large that only huge datacenters can keep up. I think anything that includes middle-class hobbyists will be just fine. For example, gigabit fiber and a few grand worth of hardware. Today that would translate to blocks much much larger than 1mb.

I think no part of the name "bitcoin" is descriptive. There are no coins, every single newbie trips over this and thinks they "can't afford a whole bitcoin".
"Bit" isn't helpful either. The digital nature of bitcoin is not what makes it interesting. It depends on computers, sure, but so does every other currency nowadays.
What makes it interesting is how everyone agrees on the state of the ledger.
That said I don't have a good name in mind, and I don't think there's a chance in hell of everyone agreeing on a new name anyway. Not that we all need to agree on a name, people can call it whatever they want. People know the US dollar's official name is "dollar" but people call them "bucks" and are still understood.

I do like the general idea, but quite frankly the idea of having a mining chip in a mobile device is insane.
Phone battery power is worth hundreds of times more than what it actually costs at an A/C outlet. Why is that? Because **A/C outlets are not available!**. That's what defines a "mobile" device.
So ok, the mining chips will be off when on battery, but that just cuts their already-small revenue by about 2/3.
What would make more sense to me is this: a device you just plug into a wall at home and forget about. It has mining chip, node software, and wifi. Whenever you access a paid article on the web (even if you're not home), you pay for it with the mined bitcoin (you can do this from mobile, if it has the same keys, or the device can sign a transaction on your mobile's behalf). Whenever someone pays to view your content, it receives the payment.

@_date: 2015-06-24 10:45:00


I hadn't really made any assumptions about how to implement it, but this sounds reasonable. Since it's a planned change, the nodes should not pretend to be bitcoin nodes. So a minor change to the SPV clients would need to be made to change (perhaps) the port and seed nodes. Either that or a somewhat more involved change to allow the SPV client to participate on any or all of the forks.


Yeah, so?


Great, that means only forks with real improvements will survive and the rest will die off, which is exactly what I want.


Any money could possibly become worthless in the future. But yes, I agree with you here, the odds here are rather high, and most people don't want to mess with that volatility. I think this just shows that the whole ecosystem is going to be rather volatile for a while and we're trying to force stability that just isn't possible yet. It will be stable when there aren't any more major controversies. If those controversies never get resolved, then it may be best to just remain apart in separate currencies. It really just depends on whether people value their fork more than having a larger consensus. Clearly it can go either way. Bitcoin itself is a big enough improvement on fiat that it's worth a much smaller consensus. On the other hand some bitcoin clones offered nothing substantially new, so the smaller consensus was a real drag and eventually they succumbed to bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-12-28 12:12:42
Fine, "no one should give a shit" is what I really meant.


I really do not care what "many core developers" think about this particular issue. What they fail to admit is that there's major upheaval and forking coming, and it is unavoidable at this point.

However their attempts to squash competition and block users from getting what they legitimately want, is pathetic and it won't work.

OK, yes, I am familiar with that concept too (broadcasting all state changes for a centralized server so that everyone can verify it's not inflating or producing two state changes from the same base state).

Maybe some people will go to alts instead like Monero but I doubt that, since very little bitcoin infrastructure (wallets, etc) are compatible.
@_date: 2015-12-03 10:29:43
You're talking about a technicality that can be overcome easily.
Anyone can fork the ledger and start a separate network. Really all they have to do is change the protocol slightly so that blocks valid on the old network are not valid on the new one. Then miners have to choose between mining normally on the old network, or using their hashpower to attack the new network.

This is not true. The forks have already happened in people's minds. They want the policies that they want. You can't force them to all agree to a single policy to "rule them all". 
What's important to remember here is forks **cannot be prevented**. The only thing holding them back is that being on a losing or smaller fork is often less useful than being on the bigger fork. Obviously that is not always true, since bitcoin is much much smaller than the dollar, and yet we still use it. Similarly, a smaller fork of bitcoin can still be more useful to some people even if the consensus group is smaller.
Bitcoin today is much bigger than bitcoin in 2011, but people still used it back then! So a fork that took a 2011-size bite out of today's bitcoin could very easily be viable. I see no reason for anyone to attempt to stop it. 
The only real problem (a solvable one) is figuring out what to name the resulting forks, so that people know which network you're referring to.
@_date: 2015-06-13 11:28:40
We're not even talking about accidental hard forks here. We are talking about deliberate, planned forks. It's simply a naming issue. "Do you take bitcoin?" "Do you mean forkA or forkB?" When it's accidental, there can't possibly be names for the forks, before it happens.

Merchants haven't been passing any savings on to consumers. Then they wonder why no one pays with bitcoin, decide "this bitcoin thing was just a fad" and stop accepting it, angry that they wasted time integrating it into their site.
Merchants who do offer discounts have generally seen a pretty enthusiastic response. Unfortunately that basically amounts to Fold, Gyft, Purse.io and a handful of others.

True, but unless you think the store is counterfeiting themselves, your odds of getting bad change is just the ratio of counterfeit bills in general circulation. Which is low, let's say 1%.
If you're a counterfeiter yourself, your expected return on that transaction is still over 90%. The store's problem is that they don't know if you're a counterfeiter or not, but the transaction you're asking them to make is something a counterfeiter would do.

If you envision a world where people simply hold Bitcoin instead of gold or savings accounts or CDs, then a $200k valuation is reasonable.
And yes Bitcoin is the only game in town. It is hard money, which is nearly the entire value prop of cryptocurrency, and nothing else comes close.

You're talking about hardware that was never turned on in the first place and isn't contributing to difficulty.
Difficulty follows bitcoin's value. Bitmain shutting down has no direct effect on bitcoin value, so there's no reason to think difficulty will change beyond perhaps some short-term bumps. 
Worst case, miners will be shut down due to lack of cash to pay costs. Rather than let them depreciate, they will be sold off (probably at a steep discount) and whoever buys them of course intends to mine with them. They'll be offline for no more than a month.

Well, obviously they think the FUD's going to work, and that their credibility will be untouched.
I have no idea why. Everyone who uses bitcoin today is accustomed to it working pretty well, and when that stops due to a block size limit, they're going to fork. Threats that bitcoin is "too big to fork" is going to fall on deaf ears, I have no idea how anyone could think otherwise.
That's why I'm surprised people like Adam Back are saying stuff like this, he's not bright enough to see Blockstream has already lost this war?  The FUD seems incredibly desperate: 
It's so disingenuous to me to call both sides of the fork "bitcoin" and hence 42M "bitcoin" and ledger "irreconcilable". They'd be only slighly more related than Dogecoin and Litecoin are to each other (slightly because they have some shared history). No one worries that Dogecoin and Litecoin cannot be merged together.
If someone doesn't know what a hard fork means for them, they've gotten in over their heads with bitcoin and should probably wait it out for a while.

Oh they absolutely do, if there is a large amount of change involved. Try buying a $2 soda in a convenience store and paying with a $100. Some will grudgingly accept after asking if you have anything smaller, some will just refuse.
It makes sense, what you're essentially asking there is "will you give me your known-good money in exchange for this possibly-counterfeit money"? 
However, when there is no change involved, the risk of counterfeit is the same regardless of denomination of the bills, so there's not really a good reason for anyone to refuse a $100 to pay for something that costs $100.

It's not going to happen like that. Satoshi is never going to put a million coins for sale at once, it would identify him immediately, and he'd not get a very good price for them.
His coins may never move. He may be dead, he may not want the money, he may not want to risk being identified.
If he does sell coins, it would be slowly and after thorough mixing. This will not cause significant market disruption. The market may panic when the see the first early coins move, but once they see they're just being slowly mixed, the panic will quickly subside.
Edit: i'm not that familiar with what's know about which coins are likely to be his, but I'm pretty sure he has a substantial amount (probably many 1000's) he could move without anyone being certain they're his. Obviously the very earliest coins are his, but he was around until 2011. So it's possible he's already cashed some in.

The consumer most certainly does "give two shits". Just ask bitpay customers whose payments were "lost". Whose problem was that? The customer's. The merchant doesn't give a shit - bitpay is the customer's problem. 
The merchant's contract is "I'll release the goods when I receive payment from third party X in your name". He takes zero responsibility for that payment system. The entire responsibility is on the customer.
The merchant does not accept Visa, he does not accept Bitpay. He accepts cash and bank deposits. Just so happens the only way to show him a bank deposit is through visa or bitpay.

Just because you can pay with bitcoin at a merchant, doesn't mean they accept bitcoin.

I think we're getting ahead of ourselves, there's a long road ahead.
Scaling is not solved. The recent block size argument has revealed an even more important issue: the interplay of bitcoin, software, and trust. Very few people understand the complexity of the software and the consensus rules. So they have to trust someone else to understand it for them. Who will that be? There can never be any "official" team because anyone is still free to modify and distribute software.
I think prices could go way lower if the scaling fight gets ugly. However I'm confident that it will be solved and the market will respond accordingly. It may take a couple of years though.

Yes the transactions are there, but your name is not, and accurately putting your name on your transactions is expensive and will remain so. In order to deanonymize 100% of btc transactions, an attacker must collect identifying information from every bitcoin user on the planet. As there is no global mechanism to do this, and there probably never will be, it will remain expensive and there will be massive gaps in the data, which you can quite easily hide in.
While it may be easy for a government to know that you withdrew coins from a KYC-requiring exchange in their jurisdiction, it will be very difficult for them to know what happened to them after that. Even if they haven't moved, that doesn't mean you still have access to them. You know, tragic boating accident.
@_date: 2018-08-22 18:49:15
Yes, I agree that the end game is bitcoin as the unit of account. It's got a long way to go. First everyone needs to have some bitcoin (use it as a store of value, not caring whether they can use it everywhere or not). Until then it can't be a medium of exchange because hardly anyone has any to exchange for stuff. Then once it's a medium of exchange, it can take over as a unit of account, because it's the one unit that the whole world has in common.
Just the first step (everyone having some) is going to take at least a decade and probably a generation. That is why I'm not the least bit worried about scaling. That is not what's holding bitcoin back in the slightest. It's just complete lack of understanding of the superior monetary properties and its inevitability.

It certainly helped get the word out, and provided an early use case. However I fully believe bitcoin would have been fine without it. In some ways, it would have appeared MORE legitimate - as a gold-like commodity instead of a purely criminal tool.

Wealth is in fact being stored in bitcoin. Calling it "speculation" makes no difference.
If you think a "privacy" coin is going to be substantially different, you are sadly mistaken. Major exchanges are going to report your privacycoin withdrawals to the government, just the same as they would bitcoin. 
You have to ask yourself what the threat model is. If you're worried about your counterparty ratting you out, privacy tech doesn't help you at all. If you're worried about a 3rd party, bitcoin is somewhat resistant to that by default, and more resistant when you take some simple precautions.

Don't panic.
The balance you see doesn't really mean anything. If you have the private keys, then you own the bitcoins. On the trezor, the key is derived from your seed and password. If you have those, then you still own the coins. If you have your transaction records, then check the balance of the bitcoin address you last sent them to (on blockchain.info, for example). If the coins are still there, then you're fine.
The question is why is your balance showing zero? Could be an issue with mytrezor (or whatever wallet you use), or you could be typing/pasting your password incorrectly.
If the balance history is also empty, then you are probably in the wrong account (which means you used the wrong password).
But just to rule that out, try a different wallet (try electrum if you use mytrezor, or vice versa). If the history is empty there as well, that almost certainly means you've got the wrong password.

I disagree completely. Bitcoin is more than just a way to buy weed.
Bitcoin has been horribly mis-marketed. First as a alternative to paypal cheap payments (on which it could never actually compete). Then as a way to buy drugs (which is fairly effective, and a reasonable use case, but not what bitcoin is truly about). The real gobsmacker of bitcoin is that it is the very first asset whose supply is completely inelastic. Nothing like that ever existed before. It will obliterate gold. That's more important to the world than letting people buy weed.

It's not totally private by default. However generally it takes some expensive detective work for someone to determine which coins are yours, even if you do nothing. That is good enough protection for most people- in fact that's the same economic security model bitcoin uses elsewhere - making it expensive for an attacker but not impossible.  You can increase the privacy yourself if you're so inclined. 
If you want 'pretty good', you can run a full node wallet (so you aren't giving away which addresses are yours), and you can mix your coins. A simple way to do that is by depositing at an exchange and withdrawing a few days later (not perfect privacy, but makes the trail harder to follow). You can also do shapeshift to XMR and then back to BTC. And finally you can use explicit mixing protocols (which is harder to set up but probably better privacy).

Let's look at the long term potential of centralized payment systems (Paypal, Apple Pay) vs Bitcoin.
The centralized solution is **much** faster and cheaper (potentially).  Transactions take a tiny fraction of a second and cost basically nothing.  Granted no one offers such a service today, but the technology exists.  Generally these solutions are also beholden to authorities who will make judgments (seizures, reversals, blockades). 
Bitcoin is neutral.  No one can seize your money and no one can prevent you from spending it as you see fit.

Well, sort of, they could blow through the existing buy orders, but more buy orders would flood in as soon as the news got out.

Concern trolling, but I'll bite.
No, not worried. There's nothing wrong with buying stock in a company whose products you don't use yourself, but you think others will. That's what the bitcoin ETF is. 
Stop talking about "adoption", it's totally irrelevant today, tomorrow, next year, and five years from now. Bitcoin is the very first asset in the history of the world whose supply cannot increase when its price goes up. Nothing can ever beat bitcoin at that, it can only imitate - and bitcoin's got a huge head start. It will defeat gold, and after that savings accounts, and then on to obliterate most of the m2 money supply. It will reach price levels that astound even the most OG bitcoiners (actually it already has, but will again).
All that matters now is acquiring as much of it as possible. Using it for payments is utterly irrelevant - you could, but why? The whole point of it, today, is that it will be worth far far more in the future. Every bit of your time and energy spent on "adoption" is wasted, because you could have spent it on acquisition.

I don't think we should call it "digital currency" either.
Dollars are also a digital currency.  Most dollars only exist as database entries in a computer somewhere.  Yes, a small percentage of dollars are in physical form, but there are also a small percentage of bitcoin in physical form.
If there's any one word that distinguishes between dollars and bitcoin, I'd say it's "decentralized".  Bitcoin is a "decentralized currency".

I've never seen any site that uses this.  How does this work?  Can't a user of a merchant site just claim they don't have 3d-secure support?  Merchants can't just turn away everyone who doesn't have it.
From the wikipedia article sounds like the first version of it was just as broken as the legacy system (a single password that once captured, allows the attacker to charge the account forever).  Then they finally implemented OTP's which is what they should have been doing all along.

This will not happen until around the year 2140.
I shouldn't need to say any more, but just in case:
* Bitcoin will probably no longer exist, having long since been superceded by something better.
* Even if it does, the number of transactions that can be included in a block without overloading your average bitcoin node, will be far higher than today.  That means probably 1000's of times more transactions so the fees could still be low.

Sounds to me like it was in fact brainwallet.org's RNG.  Not really your fault.
PSA: Random number generators are tricky!  There is absolutely no way to tell whether they are broken or not by looking at the output (it will look plenty random).  The only way to know if someone will be able to guess the output, is if you look at the code of how it's implemented.  And if you're not a coder you have to trust someone else to do this for you.
I used bitaddress.org, I was not convinced it was random enough, I helped make it better.  But I'm a coder so I was in a position to help both myself and other users.  (Note: the "old" RNG in bitaddress.org was probably quite safe from the attack OP suffered, but it wasn't **clearly** safe from more powerful attackers (eg, supercomputers).  The update made it, in theory, simply not brute-forceable at all.)

I would go further and say that if you have to deposit bitcoins period, it's not a real exchange.  That would make all current exchanges not "real" because you have to give up your bitcoins in return for the exchange's promise to repay you (if you later want to withdraw).

So?  Any pool could target BitPay or CoinBase in the future.
Some people apparently think mining pools should be totally neutral, but I don't see any reason why this should be so.  I see no reason why mining pools can't attack a threat to the network.  Yes, that leaves room for judgment, but if individual miners don't like that judgment, they can leave the pool.  
You have to understand that many people consider these betting sites a DOS attack on the bitcoin network, and I happen to agree with that characterization.

Until recently, if you bought something on Amazon, you were required to declare it on your state taxes and pay sales tax on it (because Amazon didn't charge you state taxes).  Very few Amazon customers actually did this, and the various state governments got pissed enough about it to force Amazon to start collecting the taxes.

Ethereum seems like an elegant solution to "everything", which would be great and I think what people are excited about.  I'm not so confident they'll pull it off.  I'm no expert but there seems to be a lot of handwaving around potentially serious flaws.
I am guessing their devs can maybe explain this away, but seems like it would eventually end up that attackers will find bugs in scripts and exploit them with specially crafted inputs.  So it will at worst steal money and at best burn money.  Ok maybe those scripts would have to be poorly written, but most software is poorly written :)  Writing programs that handle money has to be done especially carefully, and seems like lots of people are going to get their money stolen.
With bitcoin you have to be very careful about security but at least you only have to trust (or inspect yourself) one program - the bitcoin client.  With ethereum (as I understand it) you will have to trust (or inspect) scripts as well.

Depends on the target audience.  People who use bitcoin for cheap/fast payments, then yes all that matters is consensus size (and/or brand, they are related).  A bunch of alts are just as fast/cheap.
However I argue that cheap/fast payments are a red herring.  Bitcoin's value is neutrality.  Paypal (or any third party) could very easily do a centralized crypto cash scheme that confirms in milliseconds and costs tiny fractions of a cent.  Eventually they'll have to implement this to compete.
At that point, bitcoin's ONLY value proposition is neutrality.  Then a feature like anonymity becomes very important to the remaining target audience.
@_date: 2014-01-30 01:14:02

Sounds great overall, but a lot of the details make me uneasy.  Cringe, actually.


Are you sure?  How do you create the key in the first place, and how do you protect it from being stolen before it's split?


Sounds convoluted and insecure.  The half-keys are not encrypted, right?  So anyone can view them in transit.  Also anyone who can access your current email can access these half-keys so it's only as secure as your email (which is not secure enough).  Once someone has the half-keys what else do they need to get the other half from your service?  You don't mention any authentication.

For pete's sake.
Forking the bitcoin software (in a way that results in a consensus fork), does create a new currency at the time of the fork.  They have a shared history, but coins you receive on one fork after the split cannot be spent on the other.
So, it's not bitcoin.  Not sure why this is so difficult to understand.

It doesn't.
The facepalm is for the investors in the ETF, not bitcoin itself.  They're investing in a censorship resistant currency, but they're doing in a way that's not censorship resistant at all.
Gold ETFs are a bit silly also, they do sort of make sense considering that it can be expensive to physically secure gold, so you let someone else hold it for you.  It's not expensive to secure bitcoin, there's only one possible reason to let someone hold it for you in an ETF:  to avoid taxes by holding bitcoin derivatives in a retirement account.
It doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me to want to use pre-tax money either.  The growth is still taxed as income and not capital gains (IIUC).  The growth will likely dwarf the original investment (or the initial investment will be gone) - it's a binary outcome.  Seems better to me to pay the income tax up front, just buy bitcoin (which is then censorship resistant), and pay capital gains on the growth (assuming the IRS will have any way of knowing your cost basis, which they won't).

I don't think this is true. The only place confusion would creep in, is if people call two different forks by the same name.

I'm not saying bluetooth LE won't work, it's just not going to be as simple as OP wishes it was.  NFC is so much simpler just because an attacker cannot physically position himself between the payer and payee (since there's only a few millimeters of space).
You're either going to have to trust some third party to tell you which BTLE tags to pay, or you're going to have to be careful which ones you send payment to.  
With NFC (and also QR codes) the store is responsible for their own equipment.  If they tell you to scan a QR or tap an NFC tag, they are implicitly vouching for it.  If some third party has compromised it, that is **their fault and their loss**.  With BTLE it's basically the same except you have to be careful not to fall for a spoof (send payment to "Amazon", not "Aamzon").

Most people do not give a flying fuck about irreversible transactions or predictable money supply or peer to peer technology.

Ok so wait for it to be proven. At that time, one bitcoin will be valued well over $100k, possibly much higher.
The draw of bitcoin is that so many people are just wildly overestimating the risk. Those who examine bitcoin fully see that it's solidly built, and has clearly superior qualities as money. Literally the only thing in its way is people not having looked at it carefully enough.
That's what made it the opportunity of a lifetime, and it probably still is.

You have completely missed my point.


Never said that!  Even if only 1% of the world uses bitcoin, that's about 500x larger than today.


This is not relevant.  As long as bitcoin still uses POW (the foreseeable future) it's going to be more expensive than centralized transactions (by this I mean the cost to do the transaction, not what companies actually charge).


Consider the analogy of digital music.  Filesharing is the pressure valve that lets out pent-up demand.  Most people do not download music on bittorrent, they get it from Apple Music store, Grooveshark, Pandora, Spotify, etc.  Most people do not escape via the pressure valve, but its existence is what keeps the pressure low.  Filesharing is what forces those services to be competitive.  If filesharing didn't exist, digital music would not exist.
Edit: note the pressure valve was initiated mostly by Napster in 1999.  It's 15 years later and the pressure is not totally equalized yet.  I don't expect bitcoin's pressure release to take nearly that long.

Nothing's 100% safe.
What helps against theft/loss of your printed seed would be Shamir's Scheme, which would split the seed into n pieces such that any m of them could restore the seed.
However, this is not a good idea to do yourself, because in order to compute the shares with this scheme, you need a computer.  So you'd have to enter the seed into a computer, which defeats the entire purpose of it.
The Trezor firmware needs to perform this calculation itself, and just show you the different shares.  I don't know if SL plans to implement this or not.  
In the meantime, you have to balance the risks of theft and loss.  More copies leans toward risk of theft.  Fewer copies means more risk of loss.

Don't you think it's fairly easy to agree on what "neutral" rules are for bitcoin? There is more than one set of valid neutral rules, but it should be obvious when you're violating neutrality. Any rule which grants powers to some parties but not others, is not neutral.
I don't worry either about splits in the consensus, I'll just keep following the neutral rules.

I just read over the FAQ there:  "simply walk to the counter with your purchases and say you’re paying with PayPal—all done hands-free. The merchant does the rest and you receive your receipt electronically."
Uh what?  They are clearly leaving out something very important.  While the beacon can tell the cashier which of their customers are in the store, it cannot tell her which customer is standing in front of her.  So I cannot think of any way this experience could possibly be "hands free".  **Something** has to identify you, and there's no way they can just accept you telling them your name (otherwise, you just need to know the name of some other customer in the store, and you can get them to pay for your purchase).  You either have to take your phone or your drivers license out of your pocket.  Not hands-free at all.

I agree with you that discounts won't happen until there's competition in the same sector.  But these companies need to realize there already is competition for our bitcoin:  holding.

In order to use different identities, you have to move funds within your wallet.  And then afterwards, if you buy something from the same site again, you either have to move funds again, or the site has to allow you to identify with a different address than you previously paid with.

It *would* be very impressive if it actually was that simple, but it's not.
It's not easy to prove you are the rightful owner of an SMS number or an email address.  These things are not secure.
I don't even think coinbase's email send is secure.  Anyone at any point in the email's transit route can steal the payment.  All they have to do is grab the link, load the page and set up the account before the true email owner does.  Now coinbase may (or can) put a time delay in so that the rightful owner can see the hacker trying to steal the coins, and stop it.  However then it becomes a DOS game where the hacker can at least prevent the rightful owner from getting the coins.  Plus, time delay means a day or more of waiting, even if it "works".
SMS has the same issue.

I think a watch form factor is not going to sell.  IMO a hardware wallet belongs on a keychain, or in your fiat wallet, or alongside it.
Connecting to the internet is not the hardware wallet's job.  All it needs to do is sign transactions.  Presumably, the owner has another device that already has an internet connection.  It makes no sense to pay for  mobile data and only use it for bitcoin.
The whole reason for hardware wallet's existence is that smartphones are not secure enough.  It's not that they don't have a good internet connection, camera, and screen - they do.  So the hardware wallet just handles security.  The communication can be done through the phone, via NFC, bluetooth, or USB.

Making a hardware-compromised trezor is a pretty expensive undertaking.
Only a few thousand trezors have been sold, so I can't see how this attack could be anywhere close to profitable, yet.
The only attack that might be worth it is using the same hardware but putting hacked firmware on it.  Then the attacker makes their own fake box or just carefully reseals the original.  You can mitigate that by compiling the firmware yourself and loading it on the trezor.
It's probably safe.
However, the small savings of ebay vs SatoshiLabs is NOT WORTH IT.  If your stash is small enough that you balk at spending an extra $20 or $30 to protect it, just don't bother with a Trezor at all.
You probably need to have at least 20-30 BTC before trezor is worth it, unless you don't mind spending the money just for the novelty or to experiment with the technology.

I post this as a response to bitcoin skeptics who think that bitcoin is too hard to use.
"Confirmations? Nodes? Satoshis? Nobody knows what these things are, therefore bitcoin is hopeless."
Well, here's a video clearly showing that the concepts of "dial tone", "receiver switch", "rotary dial", etc were completely unknown. Yet the telephone became ubiquitous anyway. Everyone learned. It wasn't really that hard.
And bitcoin isn't that hard either. Telephone users didn't need to know how switching worked or what was inside their device. Similarly bitcoin users don't need to know what miners do nor all the software machinery inside their wallets.

There are scenarios where that would cease to be the case, I think that's what Peter is worried about - miners attacking smaller miners until all that was left was controlled by a small oligarchy.  And that oligarchy decides they don't want to process your transactions.
This is definitely a realistic threat, AFAICT.  
However, high fees are also a threat.  I'm no expert but my limited knowledge suggests that it's easier to build off-chain mechanisms than figure out how to prevent mining centralization.

By allowing people who forgot their passwords to still access their account you are just adding another window for attackers to get in.  And they do.  This very subreddit is **full** of stories of hacked accounts where the attacker did not get the password, but he **did** get control of the victim's email and was able to compromise the account and steal the bitcoin within.
We are all accustomed to websites with shitty security, but it's probably high time we started taking some responsibility.
Edit:  not to mention, email password resets are horribly insecure no matter how well you protect your email password.

The "message" is the block they're trying to solve, which consists of a list of transactions that people on the network want confirmed.
Let's say this is the message:
"10btc Jack -&gt; Jill, 15btc Alice -&gt; Bob"
So there are several ways of altering this block without altering the actual transactions.  Among them are
* Adding a nonce, which is just some extra gobbledygook that serves no other purpose, and the network recognizes that's all it is.  The easiest way to change the block is to just change the nonce.  I think usually they just keep incrementing it, "aaaa", "aaab", "aaac" etc but I don't know the details. So, "10btc Jack -&gt; Jill, 15btc Alice -&gt; Bob,aaaa"
* Changing the order of the transactions
* Adding new transactions that have happened as they are trying to solve the block
You also need to know what a hash function is.  It takes any data as input, and outputs a fixed length number that looks random (edit: and the function always gives the same output for the same data).  In bitcoin's case the number is 256 bits. The important thing is, you can't figure out anything about the original data by just by knowing the number, and a tiny change in the original data will result in a *completely different* number.
For example, 
* "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa" -hash-&gt; "26476826"
* "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaab" -hash-&gt; "93601247"

It has to have a baked in estimation, and if that estimate starts to diverge from reality, it'll have to hard-fork to change the estimation formula.

I don't want to get into the minutae of all these individual laws.
The point is, there are laws on the books against activities that don't hurt anyone. Perhaps some of them are rarely enforced, that is irrelevant.  Money laundering is one of these laws and it's enforced very strictly.  It's not actually "laundering" it's "failing to report the source of your income to the authorities".  Even if your income is completely legitimate, using it in a way that might be similar to what criminals do is STILL a crime.  See "structuring".  If you make deposits of $9000 instead of larger ones, that is illegal. There is simply no way to imagine a "victim" of this "crime".

I think it's interesting how the block reward schedule seems "just about right", where by the time the reward gets low, network connections will be faster and so the network can handle more transactions.  More transaction capacity means more miner income and/or lower fees.  But the decline is fast enough that early adopters can invest without fear of too much inflation.  
It really is kind of amazing how many things Satoshi got right without any direct experience.

Look, the issue will always be your profile.  If the government targets you, it doesn't matter what the law is, they'll find a way to put you in a cage.  Conversely, if you're small potatoes, just going about your daily business and don't pose a threat to anyone, then you will be fine no matter how many laws you're technically breaking. 
If you are hoping that you'll be able to do whatever business you like, without being legally required to report some or all of it to the government, keep dreaming.  We have never lived in such a world and we're only getting further from it.  The only thing that's changing is that enforcing such laws is getting more and more difficult.

No, there's no other way to do it.  You can't get distributed consensus without some kind of sacrifice.


It increases security by raising the cost of an attack.


No it wouldn't, no idea why you would think this.


People much smarter than you or I already have thought about this - a lot.  There's been a lot written about it already, you should read some of it.  Pretty much every "flaw" in bitcoin is actually a deliberate trade-off, by fixing that flaw by any known technique, you have to give up something else.


I understand where you're coming from, people are scared of big miners.  But why?  It's much worse to break neutrality than to lose hashpower.  
If bitcoin miners started killing neutrality, I would just switch to whatever fork or alt maintained neutrality.  Would that mean fewer people in my consensus?  Sure, but I bought into bitcoin when it was much smaller than it was today, if I had to go back to 2012 sizes to keep the core principles, I would.  I'm not the only one.

About half of the mining power is what they would need if you waited for 6 confirms. That is simply not available for rent.

Money in video games is a sign you shouldn't be playing it.  I mean either real money or in-game money you can exchange for real money.  If you allow players to buy unfair advantage, then it's not a game.  That's exactly what many RPG's do.

Software workarounds like Tor aren't going to cut it, eventually.
Governments are slowly but surely dismantling the internet.  They regret that they didn't destroy it decades ago when they could have.  Now internet-dependent technologies like bitcoin threaten to bring down their entire house, but they can't just yank out the plug.  They will have to "boil the frog", imposing restrictions slowly enough to avoid serious blowback.  Guess what, it's already begun.

I think that's a bit of a cop-out.
We don't need trusted middlemen.  Not even computer-ignorant people need them.  All we need is software that does our bidding.  Ok, computer-ignorant people are not able to evaluate whether software will do their bidding or not.  However that doesn't mean he should give up and give money to a middleman.
It's a lot better to trust a computer-savvy person to evaluate the software (and thus you are trusting someone to understand software, not to hold your money).
This way, the person you trust doesn't have access to your money, and once they've done their evaluation you don't need to continue to trust them.

Hearing "virtual currency" is like fingernails on a chalkboard.  It's not a simulation of a currency, it **is** a currency.
If you must distinguish it from state currencies, at least use a real distinction.  Both the dollar and bitcoin are mostly transacted digitally, with a small fraction using physical tokens (yes, the fraction in bitcoin is smaller but so what).
"Decentralized" is probably the biggest difference.

How is that going to work?  Often you pay from multiple inputs.  And then even if you only paid with one, doesn't that force users to keep transferring funds within their own wallet before they can pay?  Then they have to wait for confirmation too.
Edit: i suppose you don't have to pay from the same address each time you buy something from the same site, you just have to sign with the same key to log in.  But you would not necessarily be able to log in just with your payment the 2nd time, unless you moved funds around within your wallet to make sure you had enough in the right address.

Php is a horrible programming language, but this is not why. JavaScript does the same thing.  And you seem to not know what dynamic typing is. If variables were checked at compile time, that's called static typing. Dynamic typing is a perfectly good way to program.  Python, Ruby, JavaScript, etc all do that. 
What I think you meant to say is that php doesn't give a runtime error when you use a value of the wrong type (int instead of string). It just tries to convert one to the other. That's bad, but as I said JavaScript does the same.

You can do that, it just depends on who you want to trust to release the funds.
For example, if you have 10 people in the pool, you have them each send funds to a p2sh address that requires a majority (say, 6/10) of them to sign to release the funds to the winner. 
This is not the same as a recurring payment because you don't know at the beginning who's going to receive the funds.

Tor is extremely costly in terms of slowing down traffic, doesn't seem like a good idea (at first blush) to have the entire bitcoin network pay that cost.

Of course, it's not really that simple.  At some point bitcoin, being no better than WoW gold, will cease to be interesting enough to attack.  And then it will become decentralized again and better than WoW gold.  
So not only does bitcoin price stability lead to price instability and vice versa, but centralization leads to decentralization and vice versa.  Hopefully both are dampening over time and will reach some kind of equilibrium eventually :)

Meh, cheap payments are not an inherent property of bitcoin.  It only arises when world's demand for bitcoin transactions is lower than commodity hardware's ability to process them.  If that changes, bitcoin transactions are no longer cheap.
Bitcoin's main feature is neutrality.  It doesn't care who you are or who anyone else is, it processes your transaction and controls its supply the same way.

Exactly. And everything on bisq is not cash.


Only on miniscule scales. Localbitcoins used to work on small scales. Guess what, as they got more popular, fraud became rampant and now they've been forced to rely on real-world reputation (KYC). 
I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but that is the only possible way to do fiat/crypto trading. The fiat side is, and always will be, absolutely rife with fraud because it's horribly insecure. The best possible thing a hacker can do with stolen accounts is p2p trade for bitcoin. Almost no risk and pure profit. Of course, whoever's on the other side of that trade will get burned when the bank reverses the transaction a week later. This will happen over and over and over until there are no idiots left to fleece.

Put it this way, what kind of savings account actually trades one type of asset for another under some conditions? For example, you have a dollar savings account, but if the dollar goes up against the pound, suddenly your savings account switches to pounds. That's what ledgerx is selling here.

Yeah, if speeds continue to improve the way they have historically, bitcoin will probably only have scaling issues temporarily, if at all.
Still, I wish the community would recognize that neutrality and censorship resistance is THE ENTIRE POINT of bitcoin, and we should not sacrifice those things at all.
Using ECC for security, fast confirmation, cheap transactions - these are all things that centralized systems could easily incorporate and do it much faster and cheaper than bitcoin.  Because they don't have the burden of trying to be neutral.
Bitcoin can't win on speed and cheapness.

Doesn't matter as long as people are currently getting their heat that way, which millions of people are.
Home heat is often done by a heat pump (when it's electric powered) which is more efficient than just plain electrical resistance. But electric hot water heaters, IIUC, are always electrical resistance. At least here in the US, a large percentage of homes don't have gas lines, all their appliances are electric, including hot water.  I would imagine that is true in many other countries also.

I'd say most bitcoin users today are not aware of it.  However it's not a secret, as your posted link shows.
I've seen it mentioned in comments in this subreddit occasionally.
Why is it so important that users be aware of it?  Is the suggestion that it could happen again?  I very much doubt that the same bug is going to come up again.
Even this whole class of bugs is not particularly worrisome.  Yes, it can cause blockchain forking and rollbacks for whoever ran the buggy client.  However it shouldn't affect the entire network, just those who were rolled back.  It's a risk, sure, but there are bigger risks to worry about IMO.  Miner attacks for example.

It's still possible to get hacked if your computer is infected with malware, you will simply get MITM attacked and your hacked browser will just cover up all the SSL errors and display a green lock icon.
Then the MITM will pass you a message to sign but he'll change the address to his own.  The message will be signed with HIS key instead of mtgox's, but unless you know what mtgox's public key is supposed to be via some safe side channel, you will never know it.  The message will appear to be signed by mtgox so you sign the withdrawal.  Then your money goes to the hacker.

I'm actually impressed how fast things are progressing.
Most people have never really thought about money (what it is, how it works) in their lives. I certainly never gave it that much thought until I started researching bitcoin.
Turns out money is basically a proof-of-sacrifice.  You performed some labor or gave up some possession, and you didn't get labor or a possession in return.  Instead you got "money", something you can later present to anyone else in the consensus and get back the value that you gave up.
Money doesn't need to be "backed" by anything. If the consensus is large enough for you (enough people accept these proofs), then it's money.  There's nothing physical about it, necessarily.
Bitcoin fulfills that role better than any other money.  It's proof and consensus, and basically nothing more.

We're so far from people understanding what bitcoin is, much less using it.
Yes bitcoin can be cheaper/faster, but mostly it's for purposes where otherwise you could not do it AT ALL.
* Avoiding capital controls
* Avoiding Visa's censorship of Wikileaks
* Buying forbidden items
* Payments that otherwise would draw unwanted attention from authorities
* Avoiding hyperinflation
Most people don't really care about that, they just want to buy groceries and gas and use Amazon prime.  Bitcoin is way more trouble than it's worth, until you need it.  A lot of people will need it, sometime.  Hype is not really helping, it will just end in disillusionment.

I don't see any of this making the slightest bit of difference.
Miners have already demonstrated that they are technically inept and lazy enough to just trust someone else to validate blocks.  Even after a 51% attack materializes they will continue to mine for the attacker, because why bother to switch when everyone else will?
The only thing that will cause any action is the price of bitcoin plummeting as a result, forcing them to either switch or stop mining completely.  (most likely they'll just turn off their miners because after bitcoin crashes to professor bitcorn levels, it's not worth doing).
Hopefully, lessons will be learned and after bitcoin slowly regains confidence, miners won't be so stupid.
P2pool is not that hard to run, but it could be easier.  Why not make it a first class citizen - build it into core or have an optional download that includes it.
It kind of blows my mind that bitcoin software does not **come with** a pooled mining utility with a neutral policy.  It's just begging miners to let someone else decide the policy.

It won't work for this particular purpose.
The idea is to encrypt and sign a message with your bitcoin private key, that says "I, Joe Bloggs, who lives at 123 Fake Street, am the rightful owner of the bitcoins secured by this private key".  The timestamping service then signs the encrypted message.  Then Joe **keeps the message to himself**.  That is the key.  We don't want everyone destroying their privacy now just in case crypto is broken in the future.  Then if the crypto that secures the private key is broken later, Joe can produce his signed message (that now anyone can decrypt). 
Of course this is all predicated on the condition that the crypto that the timestamping service uses to sign their messages is not broken.  But that seems plausible since in this scenario one crypto algorithm is broken but not all of them.
Edit:  silly me, you know what?  The blockchain would work fine if you encrypt the message.  Because no one else would be able to read it (and hence reveal your ownership of the coins), unless the crypto was broken.

Just because Amazon is huge business, and it's on the internet, does that make bloggers any less able to publish their content without anyone's permission?  No.  Similarly, just because Wall Street builds huge bitcoin business doesn't make me any less able to do business with whoever I please without having to ask Visa or Paypal's permission.

The one thing I'm not wrong about is, once your biometric data has been compromised, you can't get a new body.
Properly implemented, PINs are better.  How they're normally implemented (with ATM cards for example) are very bad - I'm not defending those systems.  The trezor does it pretty well.  Attacks on PINs are pretty easy to defend against.  The trezor uses very slow encryption and increasing timeouts to defend against brute force attacks.  It's pretty easy to shield the Trezor from view while entering the PIN. Even capturing your finger movements with a camera and analyzing them later won't help, because the prompt changes every time.
Biometrics requires a larger investment to make the first attack.  You have to produce a good "fake" finger or wrist or whatever, but then subsequent attacks are very cheap because that fake will work against the entire class of biometric devices, not just against one target's device.  The only overhead is to capture the individual's biometric data.  With fingerprints, that is extremely easy.  EKG is currently difficult but I don't see any reason why it would remain difficult if it became a high-value target.
Attackers can only capture PINs while the target is legitimately using his device.  Attackers can capture biometric data **anytime**.

Well, of course if a user made no effort to ensure that actually belongs to whoever they're talking to, then of course he could be taken advantage of.
There is no solution for that level of laziness.  If you think I misunderstand the problem then we're talking about the wrong problem.  If the "problem" is that I should be able to know that I'm talking to Joe online, without any secure side channel, then anything I suggest will be flawed because that isn't fixable.
You *have* to presume a secure side channel.  If there was a way to be secure without that, then key signing parties would not exist.
Now can I assume we've put that to rest.  We're assuming a secure side channel, right?
Ok.  Now what do we pass over that side channel.  The namecoin name is sufficient, if you assume the user will actually compare the name he's using to the one he got over the secure channel.  Now you say (and you're right) that users are lazy and don't always do this (which is why phishing exists).  One way to combat that is with visual hashes because the user is more likely to recognize a totally different visual than he is a slightly mispelled name.  It's still not perfect because the user could ignore that as well.  But that is the best you can do.

The only difference bitcoin makes is that they cannot forcibly seize your bitcoin, however they can bring to bear all kinds of pressure that will cause you to voluntarily hand them over.  Imprisonment, for starters. Torture or violence against your family is not out of the question either.
You're only better off, for now, because bitcoin isn't on their radar yet.  It won't last.

Sure, I'm not saying don't buy them. I'm saying there's no point to buying bitcoin and then just blowing them at newegg or overstock.  It's a waste of effort.
Here's what you can do
* HODL (trying to make money as an appreciating asset)
* Spend where no other currency will work (to get around regulation, for example to transport money across borders).
Makes no sense to leave dollars sitting in your bank account and spend bitcoin at market rates.  It's fun but the novelty quickly wears off.

There's nothing wrong with insurance.  Bitcoin just gives you the choice not to pay for it if you don't want to.  But as I said the discount is not free, you lose the insurance.  Sure, with a company like newegg you're less likely to need it (would probably be because they made a mistake, not deliberate fraud).

I'd spend bitcoin on newegg or overstock if they offered a small discount - 1 or 2%.  But with no discount, they're not getting my bitcoin, it makes no sense to use them.  If I use my credit card on newegg, I get the same price AND I can get my money back if I return the item.
I bought a couple things from overstock with bitcoin, just for the novelty but I won't be doing it again unless they make it worth my while.  Fortunately Patrick Byrne knows they'll have to offer a discount eventually.

I'd like to know how multiple voting pools would work.  Does that simply mean you have several accounts in your wallet, and each one is backed by a different voting pool?  Or is this more like, a single account in your wallet, but it's backed by a hierarchy of voting pools?  
How would the auditing assure the rest of the pool that the requested funds are being used properly?  Couldn't mtgox just lie, and say "our customers want to withdraw this amount", even though they don't?

Bitcoin is a protocol.  There's nothing wrong with the protocol.
As has been stated countless times already, some implementations expect transaction hashes in a block to be the same as the one they sent out.  It's been known for well over a year that you can't do that, and there's well known techniques to do it another way.
So no, gox didn't have a point.  Their implementation was wrong, it's possible that other implementations are also wrong.  But it doesn't affect everyone.

Inheritance?  Besides, that isn't my point that you have to do work sometime.  The point is that it appears to become much safer to stop at a certain point.  Where that is depends on how fast the economy is growing.
I suppose I can see that there should be a rather coarse feedback mechanism - if the economy shrinks, money starts to lose value and forces people to do something with it rather than lose it to inflation.  And conversely if the economy grows too fast, people just sit on their appreciating money and theoretically should slow growth.

In a bitcoin dominated world, borrowing money is very difficult since it's deflating.  It's a lot less likely that creditors would extend the US government credit to be repaid in bitcoin.  It would likely never be paid back.
@_date: 2014-04-29 17:43:32
This ties in with the model I've been advocating (that either has some flaw I'm not seeing, or large holders of bitcoin are just not seeing the value) -
Large holders of bitcoin should take a portion of their holdings and spend it to create free software that serves bitcoin users.  Write an open source distributed exchange and give it away.  Write autonomous services and give them away.  Write secure wallet software (perhaps for custom hardware, doesn't matter), and give it away.  Write secure web authentication libraries and give them away.  Write micropayment libraries and give them away.  
How is this profitable?  It dramatically increases the value of bitcoin to everyone else, so in increases the value of their remaining bitcoin.  Everyone wins.

I think this model will be rife with fraud.  You're basically talking about the Silk Road model, which yes, had a lot of good business, but a lot of cheaters who played the long con and disappeared.  Then they probably reappeared under a new identity and did it all over again.
If identities cost nothing, then cheaters will play the long con.  THey make money doing honest business, and then they make even more money cheating once they have a good rep.
I'm more of a fan of game-theory based models because they permit anonymity, although those are not perfect either.  I'd like to see someone implement it - I'm not sure how well the dominant cheating strategy would work there.  In those models, both parties lose their escrow if they can't agree.  The cheat is to refuse to agree unless the other party gives you a side payment (less than the amount in escrow).  I think that strategy is ok to exist (you can only lose if you're a coward, and you should know beforehand that's the case and not play the game).  Also there are other ways to mitigate (make it impossible to communicate with the other party via any side channel).  Edit: it's more complex than that, but i still prefer it

@_date: 2014-02-17 15:42:00
It won't work - the only way you could be sure you'd get your coins from the guy who can actually withdraw, is to use some kind of escrow service that can verify the transfer took place within mtgox.  As far as I know the only entity capable of performing that service is mtgox themselves, who have no interest in going around their own rules.

Well, obviously bitcoin is not a 1-person-1-vote democracy, since there is not even any concept of "person".  We don't even know **what** satoshi is, a person or many people. 
Bitcoin is a consensus mechanism, it doesn't care what its members are (people, programs, groups of people, whatever).  I don't think we should care either.
I think to get a vote though, you should have to prove **something**.  If you don't possess any bitcoin I can't see why you should think you get much say in it.  I suppose if you prove you run a full node 24/7 for some period of time that should count for something.  
Both of those are open to abuse of course, it's easy for someone with 100 btc to pretend he's 100 people with 1 btc each.  Or someone with 1 machine to run 100 nodes on it and pretend he's 100 people. 
I don't know that there's any solution for this unless you want to start involving trusted third parties who do things like check people's government ID.

Think about it people, if you were a mining hardware company, and you could make more money mining with your own equipment than by selling it, wouldn't you?
The reasons these companies give for selling this equipment is the most hilarious bullshit I've ever heard.

Of course there will.  There will be phishing addresses with two characters transposed and people won't notice.  
The only way to avoid the similar name issue is to use a slow hashing algorithm.  That way you cannot use a similar name (the hash will be totally different), and you cannot come up with a similar hash (too slow to brute force).
The problem with my "face hash" suggestion is that inevitably some bigshot like amazon.com won't like the face that goes with their name.  They'll refuse to have it associated with their brand.  There will be issues with racial features conflicting with targetted demographics, etc.  
You could solve this by using unique hash algs for each person, but then you can no longer authenticate by face.  (You can't tell your friend, "the real blockchain.info site's face looks kind of like harrison ford").

Meh, who cares.  Bitcoin is just as useful at ten cents each as it is at a million dollars each.  So maybe we won't be bitcoin millionaires.  But we'll have a currency that can't be diluted by government policy and won't impose limits on what kind of business we can conduct with it.  
In a way, the general population are idiots, they are fleeced pretty easily.  But they aren't *that* dumb.  Was the post office able to fool people into believing their delivery service was better than email?  Nope.  Was the publishing industry able to convince people that their printing service was better than blogging?  Nope.  It's just too obvious which is the superior product.
It'll probably take a while to sort out, but bitcoin will survive while people try out govcoin.  Eventually it'll be diluted or people will have it seized or they won't be able to spend it how they like.  And they'll be pissed, try bitcoin, and never go back.  Why would they?

Brain wallets are a terrible idea in general.  Although you seem to be using it in a mode that isn't actually a brain wallet.  Not sure why you used brainwallet.org then, instead of bitaddress.org.  (edit: ok, brainwallet.org makes regular addresses too)Also not sure why you thought that 18 different addresses was any safer, when you seem to have kept all the keys in the same place.
Anyway, your keys were in fact compromised, so you just need to figure out where.  My money is on your PC if you use windows.
I also don't know anything about brainwallet.org but IIRC people trust it?
edit: missed the part where you blame the brainwallet.org RNG.  Yup, people you have to be really careful.  The RNG is crucial to a secure key.  Take a look at bitaddress.org, I actually worked on the implementation there to make sure there was enough entropy.  Notice it uses mouse movements to collect entropy.  javascript's Math.random() is insecure and anyone writing a browser wallet app should know better.  Knowing this about brainwallet.org I would say no one should trust it again, ever.

Bitcoin is disobedience.  If you want to obey all your financial masters, (the federal government, your bank, Visa, Paypal, etc), then you have no reason whatsoever to bother with bitcoin.
However, I'd say that most people probably **would** want to disobey if they knew what they stood to gain by doing so.
Don't want to pay credit card or bank fees?  Don't want to have your income reported to the government?  Don't want your purchasing power eroded by inflation?  Don't want to be told who you're allowed to do business with?
You don't have to accept any of these things.  But let's be honest, right now you have to be highly motivated for it to be worthwhile.  It's not the kind of thing that you can do casually.  
Cash obviously has a lot of overlap, in terms of freedom.  However with cash, you can't use it on the internet, it can be difficult and expensive to secure, and its value can be eroded by the central bank's monetary policy.

Perhaps down the road you'll have money seized from your account (as many merchants do), or be hit with ridiculous fees, or have your payments blocked (as anyone who tried to donate to Wikileaks saw).  Then you may find bitcoin interesting.
No, bitcoin isn't going to take over the world.  It's going to end financial monopolies, force competition and make your dollar/bank/Visa/PayPal better.  Most people can stay out of the fray and reap the benefits without doing anything at all.  That's probably what you want to do.

This is like asking, "10,000 years ago we all lived in caves. Now we have houses and cars and stuff.  Who did we make poorer to get all this stuff?"
No one.  The economy is not a zero sum game.
Bitcoin does compete with banks and payment processors, but it will probably open up entirely new markets also. So some people may lose when bitcoin gains but overall there will be a net gain.

Well, that is kind of my point.  Nearly anyone who knows what a hash function and cryptographic signature is, can understand how bitcoin works.  But I'd guess that only a tiny fraction of those people have tried.
And even then, understanding technically how bitcoin works isn't the most important thing.  What's important is what bitcoin means in terms of revolutionizing payments, banking, government, law, etc.  I'd say many people who understand how bitcoin works fail to realize the consequences.
Side note: re the whitepaper - I only read it recently too despite having followed bitcoin for several years.  While it was nice to read, it didn't tell me anything technical that I didn't already know.  Just gave me some insight into what Satoshi intended it to be (although not much).

Maybe I wasn't clear then.  The point is that bitcoin is voluntary and fiat is not.  What makes fiat mandatory is that you have to pay taxes in it.


I did specifically say "bitcoin (the neutral money concept)".  I meant, even if bitcoin is killed, if people still believe in the neutral money concept, something else will take its place.


Yeah, I think you are missing the point.  Even if bitcoin (the current network and rule set) is subverted, people who believe in the neutral money concept will simply fork and continue on with it.  Or maybe they'll start with a whole new system.  Regardless, I believe that a neutral currency will always exist.  It may not always be the same one, though.

If that were true then people would just keep the wristband in their possession, and there'd be no need for biometrics :)
I'd say people are bad at securing anything.  That's why a good system requires something you have and something you know.  Trying to eliminate the latter is convenient for the user but, it's less secure.
If we really want to use biometrics, we need to figure out some way to do biometric OTP or challenge-response.  That way the actual secret stays within your body.  I have no idea how to do that, but whoever figures it out will probably make some money :)

I know it's different, I'm just saying, it's not like there was previously no way to send bitcoin to someone without a wallet.

This argument makes no sense.
If people are immediately re-buying bitcoin when they spend, they don't care what the price is.  
Let's say I have $800 and 10 btc.  I buy something for 0.5btc on overstock and then immediately rebuy that 0.5btc on coinbase.
End result:  I have $400 and 10btc.  The result is the same no matter what the price of bitcoin (the prices on overstock change with the exchange rate also).

Exactly.  The cost of the bitcoin network per unit time is basically the electricity costs used for mining in that time.
However, let's say that in a given minute, nobody broadcasts any transactions.  Does that mean the cost per transaction goes to infinity?  NO.  You have to look at the **capacity** of the network, not the number of actual transactions.  Reason:  the cost does not increase linearly with more transactions.  There's a flat cost associated with protecting the network, and then there's the scarcity of blockchain space cost.  The latter is far smaller.

This is all beside the point.
My point was that biometrics has a serious flaw - once the attacker has your biometric data, the entire class of authentication is broken.   With fingerprints for example, all an attacker needs is a soda can you threw away, and that's it.  You can never use fingerprint identification again for the rest of your life, because the attacker can always impersonate you.  You cannot change your fingerprints, so you are screwed.  The same is true of EKG, it's just a little harder to get that biometric data than fingerprints.

Yeah, I saw it too.  So much for his credibility.
For newbies, bitcoin does not use encryption at all.  It uses hash functions and cryptographically signed messages.  What miners do is take a message, alter it slightly, hash it.  If the hash doesn't start with "00000" (how many zeros depends on difficulty), then it's no good and they try again.  Billions of times per second, until either they find one with the zeros, or someone else does.

From the bip38 document:


Ok so the private key is under the seal, you can decrypt it with your password but you have to open the seal to get the ciphertext.

If you split with bitaddress, then when you want to spend the funds, you'd go back to bitaddress (or the offline copy you saved), and type in the shares to reassemble them into a private key.  Then you could import the key into a wallet and spend the funds.
But yes, the danger with m-of-n is that the whole key still exists both before you split it, and when you reassemble them to spend the funds.  So there's a small window of opportunity where a hacker could get the key intact.
I don't think this is a realistic worry though, if you use an offline computer to create the key, and spend the funds immediately after you reassemble the key.

There are a lot of naysayers out there who see all these bitcoin thefts and conclude that it's inherently insecure, that no "normal" people will be able to protect these secrets.
I say that is nonsense.  Yes, there is infrastructure that needs to be built to make it easy for the average Joe, but we know how to build it and it's being built.  The Trezor is a good example.
Security pros may disagree, but I think we may be heading towards everyone having a "single secret".  All your passwords, identities, payment addresses, etc, will be derived from that secret.  The "master" secret will probably be split with Shamir's and stored in various vaults. Some of the derived secrets may be less-well protected (for example, a trezor you carry around every day, or and even less protected secret would be for pocket money - your smartphone wallet keys).

Look you can't have it both ways.  You are complaining that people don't bother to spell things right, and then when I suggest visual hashes you complain that they're not secure?  NAMES ARE SECURE!  The whole point of the visual hash is you are assuming users will be too lazy to check spelling.


It's big enough.  Go ahead and generate hashes that display as human faces, until you generate one that I recognize as Abraham Lincoln.  Then let me know how many combinations you had to try.  Then make the hash take 3 seconds each and tell me how many years it would take you to brute force it.

I don't get it, why wouldn't you just decrypt it?  Sounds like the private key is locked with a password that only you know, right?  How can you give the coin to anyone else, since they would know you could have decrypted and saved the private key.

Ok first of all, what's your solution then, so that i can have just as much fun nitpicking as you are.
You're just going to keep pointing out an even dumber user who can still get fooled.  Well, of course, there's always a user who will authenticate ANYTHING without doing any checking at all.  I just want to hold you to the same standard, you come up with a way that a user who will authenticate ANYTHING won't be taken advantage of.
Second, visual hash solves the problem, go ahead and come up with a misspelling of "amazon.com" that also has a similar-looking visual hash.  There aren't enough possible misspellings.

True, but it's not as private as signing auth messages with a private key that you DON'T use for payment.  There's no reason to use the same one.  You can already shop e-commerce sites without logging in.  They use cookies to link your shopping behavior to your eventual payment, and they could do the same with a signed-message auth scheme too.


No, you wouldn't do that.  The only reason you'd ever give out a parent key is if you *wanted* to make public that you control all the addresses below it.  Normally an average user would not want to do this.
What I meant by "master" key is not the root of your entire tree of keys.  It's the root node for **that site**.  The only reason it can have children at all is for key revocation.
@_date: 2014-04-01 17:07:11
Ok for the purpose of this argument, that is not important.
The point of the blockchain is reaching consensus.  That is totally pointless when it's US Government backed currency.  In that case, the consensus is whatever the US Government says, no one else is involved.  You don't need a blockchain, nor all the inefficiency that comes with it.
Edit:  if you think the US government is going to allow anyone else to be involved in deciding the transaction history, I've got a bridge to sell you.
@_date: 2014-04-23 15:49:14
You don't think there's any difference? Today's miners, in order to be honest, need only accept transactions in a neutral way and race for the block reward.  In your proposal they need to actively try to entrap other miners into cheating in order to be "honest"?  To me this is not the same thing at all, just like the 100m dash is not the same sport as dodgeball.  In the latter you directly attack your competition.
There's a delicate balance here, is there not?  If you don't give a miner incentive to entrap other miners, he will not bother and no one will stop double spends.  If you make the incentive too strong it will become profitable to trick other miners into accepting double spends, or to band together into a mafia where you steal the block rewards from other miners who didn't even double spend.  That still follows the purpose of mining as you quoted it (double spends are prevented), but adds the additional cheat of stealing block rewards from their rightful owner which currently can't be done.
Edit: what I think is dangerous about this is if the "block reward stealing mafia" forms, end users will probably not be directly affected, so by doing this cheat, it may not affect the price of bitcoin much (and therefore the profitability of mining).  This is totally different than double spends, which directly affect the profitability of mining.

Gold and silver alone are about 7-8 trillion.  Fiat is about $60 trillion.  We're not including all the world's wealth here, just gold, silver, and fiat money.  Bitcoin is sitting at 0.00002% of that right now.
If bitcoin were to capture 1% of gold/silver/fiat market, price should be about $5,000,000.
I'm not saying bitcoin will necessarily capture 1%, but it seems possible.  It certainly seems possible for bitcoin to capture 1% (or much more) of the gold/silver market - 1% of it alone would put bitcoin at $6000.

This is an 800 word article I wrote to help clear up a lot of misunderstanding I constantly see in the media.
It doesn't talk about computers or algorithms or crypto at all, just a basic overview of what makes bitcoin different.  
Please give me feedback if you see mistakes or omissions.  Note I deliberately glossed over a lot of details.  The purpose is to explain what bitcoin's essence is, not how it all works.
Including text below [edit - formatting still a bit off, click link for better rendering]:
What is Bitcoin?
No technical background needed
To understand what bitcoin is, you don’t need to know anything about math or computers. You only need to be familiar with money.
The essence of money
Money is a form of communication. When you are compensated for your work, you don’t get food, transportation, or lawn service. You get an unforgeable message, proof that you are owed. The medium isn’t important, the message may be printed on paper bills, or be sent by computer to update a bank account balance. The message serves a single purpose: you can present it to anyone who accepts this proof, and get back useful things that you are owed. The group of people who accept this kind of proof, we’ll call the consensus. Without consensus, money is worthless. You can’t do anything with these messages except exchange them for something else.
Bitcoin is the idea, not the technology
The media often refers to bitcoin as a "digital" or "virtual" currency. This is wrong, computers are not what make bitcoin different. Most of the world’s payments have been virtual for decades, bitcoin offers nothing new there. It’s no wonder people say they don’t understand it.
Bitcoin is an idea, a "neutral" currency. In a "neutral" currency, everyone is treated equally - individuals, companies, governments, rich and poor. No special authority or trust is granted to anyone.
    No one can create money out of thin air
    No one can seize money that doesn’t belong to them
    No one can prevent others from spending their money as they see fit
Anyone can accept bitcoin as payment, and no one is forced to accept it.
Consensus and proof
Bitcoin (the technology) is a mechanism to reach consensus and communicate proof.
Each participant in the bitcoin consensus keeps their own records. He saves the entire world history of messages, passing along to other participants any history they might have missed. He follows a set of rules that decides whether each message is valid proof. He keeps an up-to-date ledger of who’s owed how much, based on all the previous history of valid proofs. By following the same rules, participants form a consensus and a common currency. If someone decides to play by his own rules, the consensus will reject his messages and they’ll become worthless.
Anyone can decide to break from the bitcoin consensus by following different rules. There’s no such thing as "counterfeit" bitcoin. Bitcoin uses mathematical proof to enforce rules, not threat of violence. It has just enough rules to create money, and no more.
Comparing with ordinary money
Your everyday national currency is not neutral.
* You must pay taxes, and you must pay them in your national currency. You are forced to accept it so that you have it available to pay taxes.
* Ordinary money does not treat all participants equally. It grants powers to a small minority. The central bank prints money at no cost, government agencies and banks seize money from other participants. These powers invite corruption and abuse.
Other differences
Price volatility
There is a lot of uncertainty about how large bitcoin’s consensus will get. Bitcoin is voluntary and relatively new. It started in 2009 with no consensus at all, and is spreading organically (roughly 1 million people as of 2014). Eventually everyone will 
decide if they want to accept bitcoin or not, and then there will be no more uncertainty.
Cheap transactions
 This is one of the most-touted aspects, but it is a consequence of technology, not consensus. Today, every modern home computer can single-handedly keep up with the entire world’s bitcoin transactions. If that changes, then transactions have to get more expensive (to discourage smaller transactions from clogging up the works), or bitcoin has to lose some of its neutrality (if your computer can’t keep up, you’ll have to trust someone else to do it. That gives them the power to lie to you).
Another aspect that is due to technology, not consensus. Bitcoin is not anonymous, it’s pseudonymous. A superhero with a secret identity is one leak away from being completely exposed. Many people in the bitcoin consensus do want true anonymity. It’s theoretically possible but it’s technically challenging and still being worked on.
Here to stay
As long as there are people who believe in neutral rules, bitcoin (the neutral money concept) cannot be killed. All that’s needed are a set of rules and the ability to save and process messages. The genie is out of the bottle, and no amount of propaganda or regulation can put it back in.

GHash.IO doesn't control the majority, as far as anyone knows.  They don't actually own all the hardware, so all the pooled miners would start leaving as soon as an attack began.
I"m talking about a scenario where the attacker owns the hardware and there's nothing anyone can do to stop the attack except with brute force (add more hashpower to overcome the attacker).
Bitcoin's value proposition is that it is trustless.  You don't have to trust anyone in particular and certainly you don't have to trust a single entity.  If one party gains 51%, then you absolutely do have to trust him.  Bitcoin becomes totally worthless at that point unless that situation can be reversed.  If you are going to trust a single entity then using a blockchain is a horribly inefficient ledger.
As for how long 51% has to exist before bitcoin loses all value, I can't answer that, obviously.  It's a subjective question that everyone will answer differently.
@_date: 2014-09-10 20:36:55
Interesting, thanks.


That doesn't tell the whole story, though, does it?  How do you find buried fiber?  As far as I know, you can't, without an exhaustive search.  
Also, the bandwidth supported by a fiber cable is orders of magnitude larger than any wireless tech can provide.  If authorities destroy 90% of the routes between two points on a fiber mesh network, the remaining 10% should still carry more traffic than a fully-intact wireless network. 
Granted, spreading a bunch of solar powered ant-sized routers is a lot cheaper than laying fiber, but these ant-sized routers do not actually exist yet.  Consider if development went into 3-d printed fiber laying devices.

No, intent to circumvent would be to somehow exchange more than 10k without following the rules.  OP is just changing his mind about how much he wants to exchange based on finding out the rules existed.

There's nothing wrong with marketing but most of the advice you see to "help spread the word" is actually counterproductive.
You only tell people how they can get bitcoin and why it benefits them.  You never try to get them to take yours.  In Dec 2012, I posted on facebook that I'd give 0.3 BTC (I think around $5 at the time) to the first 10 people who wanted it.  Guess what, none of my 500 FB friends wanted it.  You know why?  Because I was giving it away.
People generally don't give away valuable stuff.

Your security was poor, not theirs.
What you have to realize (too late) about bitcoin is that your secret (key/password whatever) is **everything**.  There is no person at a desk that you can walk up to with your driver's license and fingerprints, and say "see, it really is me, so let me have my money please".  The only way for anyone to know it's you, is your secret.  Anyone who has your secret, has your money.
And you did something incredibly foolish with that secret, you gave it to facebook (in fact it sounds like you had given it to facebook long before you re-used it as your bitcoin secret).  You didn't really say but I'm guessing the password was also relatively easy to guess.
In the future you should always use 2FA when it is available, never re-use passwords (you don't have to have a photographic memory - use a password manager like keepass or lastpass).

How does that help?  Sorry I'm not sure exactly how the construct you just described would work - do you have a link?
Somebody somewhere has to deal with accepting reversible payments.  Anyone trying to enter the bitcoin ecosystem is going to encounter problems there, because the only kind of payments they can offer are undesirable.
They have cash which is limited because it can't be transmitted except in person.  They also have credit cards, bank accounts, paypal, etc - all of which are reversible to some degree.  Someone has to either go to their physical location, or take on the risk of payment reversal.

I decided to ask on  and got an answer from gmaxwell.
He confirmed that you can't reveal one child without revealing them all, and suggested the following:


e.g. I sign up for your site, my identity is my master key. Later I login using a subkey, the subkey is signed by the master key so you accept it. Later you send the site a revocation message signed by the master key, telling it to ignore particular subkeys, so you do.

What you are saying might be true but nothing on the FAQ would indicate this.
The way I read it, the PIN doesn't encrypt anything. The device just refuses to sign anything (using the unencrypted key) unless the user enters the correct pin, and it has an exponentially increasing delay to prevent brute force.
If the attacker were able to extract the key, even if it was encrypted with the PIN, it would take the attacker no time at all to brute force the PIN offline.
This is why passwords are necessary to prevent an extraction attack (which admittedly appear to be difficult even without a password).

The network doesn't pay the mining reward.  The miner puts a transaction in the block that pays it to himself.  The network simply recognizes that this is a valid block even though it contains a transaction with no sender.  As long as the reward is not greater than the standard block reward, he could actually award it to anyone if he wanted, and it can be split among many people.

If you're referring to the IRS, the chances of that happening are zero.
He'll either die in prison or flee the US the minute he gets out.  I'm sure he'll end up paying some sort of taxes as he spends the bitcoin, just to stay out of trouble wherever he ends up.
Edit: other possibility is that he'll give up the bitcoin to get out of prison.  I'm not really sure how the legal system is going to be able to spin that as anything other than bribery, though.  Probably won't happen just because there's no way to hide it, blockchain being public and all.

It depends on what your price is.  If it's $2000, then it's not even close to the point where you don't have to cash it out.  It would still be a very risky investment.

I'm not so sure.
Fraud protection is just "hm, does this seem like a purchase mustyoshi would make?" It's a violation of privacy, first of all, and it's often just guesswork and wrong.  If the bank guesses wrong, (it's a fraudulent purchase but they don't realize it), they have to take money from all their other customers to repay you.  If they guess wrong the other way (it's legit but they think it's fraud), you are unable to complete the transaction until you are able to contact the bank and authorize it using a secure channel.
What seems to happen is banks are unwilling to deploy actual security measures - ways of reliably identifying their customers vs criminals.  Instead they just charge everyone more insurance, invade privacy further, and block more legitimate purchases.

Wow, sounds like a good plan for scalability.  Of course, I'm sure the bitcoin devs might have some more pointed questions than I can come up with.
I was wondering how a new node can bootstrap and be sure it has a valid set of balances, when all the other nodes have discarded the transaction history.  Just having proof of work doesn't tell you that all the transactions in those blocks are valid to you, just that they were valid to whoever mined them.

If you have to transmit the PIN over some secure channel, then it's not as simple as sending bitcoin via SMS, is it?  It's sending over SMS plus some other channel. If you have a secure channel then SMS doesn't really serve any purpose.
For example, I just go "Trusted 3rd Party Site" (T3PS), and say "I want to transfer 2 coins to Bob and he can claim them with the password 'foobar'."
Then I call Bob on the secure phone and say "Hey Bob, there's 2 coins waiting for you at T3PS, and you can claim them with 'foobar'".
The only part of that that SMS can handle is "Hey Bob, there's 2 coins waiting for you at T3PS".  It's a notification, not a transfer of value.  At that point the coins still held by T3PS.  They are only transferred once Bob gives T3PS the password.
Edit:  basically you're sending the coins to a PIN, not to a SMS phone number.  The phone number is just where the notification goes.

That doesn't mean bitcoin will be able to contain it.  Banks can look at their user's transaction profile and just refuse a transaction if it's fishy-looking.  They also have insurance against these losses.  Bitcoin has no recourse and the perps will very likely get away with it.

The flip side is, as the mining reward fades away, there is only one way to keep miners in the game to protect the network:  transaction fees.
This is unavoidable.  Even now, the bitcoin network consumes massive amounts of electrical power.  Someone has to pay for that power.  Today that cost is obscured by the mining reward and the fact that new adopters of bitcoin keep coming in.
Eventually that will have to end, and the network will have to subsist on transaction fees.
What does that mean?  Eventually you won't be able to buy coffee with bitcoin, since transaction fees will have to increase to somewhere between $1 and $10 (to pay for miner's electric bills).
I don't see this as a problem though, bitcoin will just become the backbone settlement network.  Everyday transactions will be done through a slightly more trustful mechanism (eg an OpenTransactions issuer that uses bitcoin-backed currency and is audited and a member of a voting pool).

Paper wallets where there is only one copy, yes, you lose it, it's gone.
But you can make wallets where there are say 3 pieces and any 2 can be used to recover the private key. 
 lets you do this (called split wallet).
And yes, even offline wallet generation is vulnerable to a bad RNG (either malicious or negligent). So don't just blindly trust these tools.

*If* you are going to be honest with the IRS and tell them how many blocks you mined, *then* they could theoretically demand blockchain proof (in order to establish what they were worth at the time they were mined).
However the IRS has absolutely no way to know that you mined at all.  And it's not even difficult to obscure it so that the blockchain can't tell them whether you mined the BTC or bought them.  
Let's say you mine a (solo) block.  You then send it to another address you control (preferably with a higher balance), and then another one.  You claim the first address is bitstamp, and the second one is yours. The IRS would have a real hard time proving that the miner wasn't someone else.

I try to balance long-term support of bitcoin against my own immediate interest.
If I went by my own immediate interest alone, I'd never spend bitcoin without being offered a discount.  But because I want merchants to stick with it, I'll support them for a little while even without a discount.
And of course always replace the bitcoin I spend (so that I'm always spending the bad money first - dollars).

The fixed money supply is totally irrelevant when you trade your bitcoin for some small uninsured company's promise to pay.  Then you own nothing but promises, whose supply is not fixed at all.
There's not really much reason to denominate those promises in bitcoin, I suppose ideally they should hold value better than fiat.  If the idea is just to transfer value instantly anywhere in the world when you've already traveled to some bank's location, well, we have Western Union already.  
These "banks" would work just as well if the users stayed in control of their bitcoin private keys.  The users don't need to connect to the bitcoin network, the ATM does that.  The ATM can just be a wallet device that anyone can use.
But that doesn't seem to be what Robocoin is doing.  They're doing it the fucked up traditional banking system way that isn't an improvement over what already exists.

It's possible but bitcoin has both the network effect and the ability to adapt. It would have to be a big failure on the community's part to lose that lead.  It's certainly happened before.

The underlying problem is that general purpose PCs and smartphones were never designed to protect high-value secrets.  And your bitcoin private key is a high-value secret.  Your gmail password is worth something, but not a lot.
I think that today, either you need to have a solid understanding of computing security, OR you need a hardware wallet.
With a hardware wallet there is really only one major remaining security issue, making sure that the person you want to pay actually owns the address you're paying.  There are scenarios where an attacker can replace an address with his own, tricking you into paying the him instead of your intended payee.
With a hardware wallet, the entire class of thefts where your coins just disappear overnight while you're sleeping, is for all intents and purposes, solved.
Edit: 
Even without a hardware wallet, you can be more secure by requiring two devices to spend your funds.  For example, greenaddress.it, you can use multisig and require both your smartphone and 2nd factor key like a yubikey.

My original criticism was about biometrics in general.  It is security by obscurity which is fine as long as it stays obscure.  The problem is when it's no longer obscure, it fails catastrophically.

Well, sort of.  His back of napkin calculation ignored the fact that nodes are generally connected to more than 1 other node.
So if you are connected to 10 nodes, you have to use more bandwidth than if you were just connected to one.  It's probably not linear though, because nodes probably have a way of saying "i already got those transactions/blocks, don't send them".
At any rate, his overall point is the same.  Even if we can only get to 1/10 VISA level that's still satisfactory for many years to come, and after all that time hardware will improve.
A decade ago 8 terabytes of bandwidth and 90mbit connections would have been prohibitively expensive for an amateur.

Ok let's not get bogged down in semantics.  My point is that it is an unnecessary invasion.  It could be solved technologically but banks are too cheap or lazy or hooked on your personal info, to implement it.


It most certainly is not!  Insurance normally incorporates your personal risk into the amount that you pay for the insurance.  Credit card fraud insurance fees that you pay, have nothing whatsoever to do with the risk you personally present.  There is nothing you can do to reduce your premium.


Oversimplification.  Individual banks don't control Visa but they are responsible for fraudulent payments made using their Visa card.  I had thousands of dollars ripped off from my Visa debit card, but guess whose fraud department contacted me?  Hint: not Visa's.  So the technology and the insurance are not paid for by the same entity.

I'm sure there are such people, but I doubt that you could call them a "sizable" group.  A guy who bought 1000 btc for $1000 who wants to cash out, how many things do you think he will buy on overstock?  There just aren't that many everyday items he needs at once.  He probably wants a car, a house and a college education for his kids.  He's not able to trade for those directly yet.

You were basically right.
When you pay on overstock, it's just plain bitcoins, they don't care how you got them.  But I think most people are not really spending bitcoins, they're spending dollars.  In other words, they trade dollars for bitcoins either immediately before or immediately after their purchase on overstock, so that the net transaction from their perspective, is dollars for merchandise.  The same thing happens on the overstock side.  So in reality this is still not a bitcoin economy at all, bitcoin is just the payment system.  Still you gotta start somewhere.  As bitcoin becomes more widely adopted (and closer to its full value), this will change.

It's kind of tiring to hear massive human error referred to as "theft".
Just because something requires a bit of research or practice or skill, doesn't mean it's not your fault if you screw it up.  Flying  a plane is hard, but a lot of crashes are still the pilot's fault.
Let's say you leave your life savings in the middle of a public square, in plain view.  You return the next day and it's gone.  Is this theft?  Technically yes, but what really went wrong here is human error.  You expected the cash to still be there, that was an error.
Similarly, when you accidentally post your bitcoin private key on pastebin, the theft is not the issue.  The problem is human error, expecting the bitcoin to still be there the next day. Of course there's no clear-cut threshhold where the effort to avoid theft is enough.  However nearly all the posts on this forum about theft have been more about error.
* Getting phished.  
* Trusting Windows with your secrets.  Or Dropbox, or really anything that's not designed to protect secrets.
Do you see people posting here, "My cold storage was stolen"?  Nope.  Aside from an occasional broken RNG, it doesn't happen.  Haven't heard any Trezor owners reporting theft either.
Bitcoin doesn't have a theft problem.  It has a problem where a fair amount of knowledge and skill are required to store it.  It's getting easier, and will soon be very straightforward - Trezor is a great example.

We can argue about what the "web" means, but I'm pretty sure that just because a browser has handler for the protocol, doesn't mean it's the "web".  The term comes from hyperlinked documents, which really is talking about HTTP.

Such nonsense. Bitcoin is both a payment network and a store of value.  If people refuse to sell their bitcoin, it's because they believe it's worth more than the current market price.  That is all.
There is no such thing as "hoarding".  Everyone has their price.  Those who are hodling, will not hodl forever.  There comes a point where they can buy everything they want (or everything they think they will ever get out of their bitcoin).
The new adopters are chasing those hodler prices, lowest first.  Those who are hodling out for $5000/btc are betting that newcomers will chase the price all the way up to that level.
Not only is this not bad for bitcoin, it's essential.
Bitcoin is not going to die on the vine just because people aren't lining up to get rid of them.  Just the opposite.  By refusing to part with them, it makes them more desirable.
Discounts will help.  Currently no one offers them so naturally nobody is seeing this as a great deal.  That's because it isn't a great deal, it's a shitty deal.  If I can pay at overstock with dollars or bitcoin, and there's no discount, I'm paying with dollars, period.  Makes no sense to do otherwise.

I'd say that is pretty accurate.
In 1993 the internet was of very little use to the average person.  You couldn't buy anything (the first online ordering system seems to be 1994, ebay was 1995), you couldn't send a message to your friends unless they were one of the few other users, the average person had no hope of publishing their own content.  There was no easy way to even search for what you were looking for (real search engines was 1994).
In 2014 bitcoin is of very little use to the average person.  You can't have it as part of your 401k, no smart contracts, you can't send it to your friends unless they were one of the few other users, the average person has no hope of securing their own bitcoin.  There is no easy way to even buy it.
Also note, bitcoin has done in 5 years what took the internet 24 years.  At that pace, bitcoin will be as ubitquitous as the internet well before this decade is over.

Well that's the whole question, is whether a given coin **can** catch up.  I'm saying that no alt can catch up unless it has some killer features.  In my opinion, litecoin's "features" are worthless, it can never catch up.  As soon as more people realize this, it will collapse.  That might take years, but it will happen.  I'm not saying it will necessarily cease to exist (since one miner can keep it going), but for all practical purposes it will go away.

You need some kind of signing authority to revoke keys.  Fortunately you can be your own authority, in theory.  When you sign up with a site, you present a signed public key.  The key is K and the signing key is M.  The signature is ignored by the site (for now), they just use the public key K to verify messages from you.
But let's say your key K is compromised.  You can use the key M you signed with to sign a new message to the site "Use this new key:  J". Then they still know it's you, and they can discard the old public key and use your new one.

Bitcoin, as great as it is, doesn't come close to solving all the problems that would need solving.
One major problem is we're bound to physical space (the surface of the earth).  There's a large cost associated with changing location that local services would exploit.  It would break down into violent militias because people can't just leave if they don't like it.

Sure, I've said myself that bitcoin is disobedience - if you don't need to disobey, you don't need bitcoin.  However, that's more of an endgame, right now (in some cases) bitcoin actually competes quite well with even on price and speed.
I'd also argue that most people don't even know yet, the myriad ways that they would disobey, once they realize they **can**.  I think it is disingenuous to say, "well, my bank works just fine!"

Not only that, they reserved the right to keep any/all the lots for sale, for any reason.

* Full anonymity
* Shorter confirmation time **without trading off security or other features**
* Consensus model that is more resistant to 51% attack **without trading off resistance to other attacks**

Exactly.  Bitcoin is an anti-censorship tool that happens to be also faster and cheaper than other payment systems (at the moment).  Eventually the competition will catch up to (and surpass) bitcoin in terms of speed and cheapness of payments.
Where they won't surpass bitcoin is in censorship resistance.  So let's not sacrifice future utility by making the block size too large.  I do think that as long as the necessary bandwidth is within reach of everyone (not necessarily your own node, but one that you can put a bit of trust in), then the block size can grow.  I'd guess a typical home broadband connection, or slightly faster, is a good sweet spot.  Somewhere in the 30-100 mbit range today.

We can use cryptography to replace trusted entities.
For example, you deposit bitcoins at mtgox, they aren't really yours anymore, you have to trust them to keep your balance correct and return your bitcoin when you withdraw.  Theoretically, we are putting way more trust in entities like mtgox (and other exchanges) than we really need to.
Opentransactions is part of a system that does the same kinds of things but without requiring all that trust.

That doesn't make economic sense for most people.
Using myself as an example, I'll get 2% more bitcoin by taking salary in dollars, and buying bitcoin on coinbase (they charge 1%).
Granted by being paid directly in btc I avoid any chance of payment reversal either by my employer or some kind of seizure by my bank.  That's extremely unusual though in most of the "banked" world.
The odds of that are so remote that I can only offer maybe 0.05% discount.  So max I can offer is 1.05%.  That's still significant but it becomes less so when my employer realizes they have to pay fees to get the bitcoin to pay me.  It only makes sense for them if they already collect revenue in bitcoin.

I think that these two additions would go a long way:
* Change p2pool to distribute funds to its donation address to all the miners just like it would with block rewards and fees.
* change clients/nodes to have the option to include fee as donation to p2pool instead of a traditional fee
I am not quite sure how to manage the p2pool donation though, I found this 
But that is not going to work since it would have to split an already small fee into 10 even smaller ones.
How about if it just awarded the fee to one miner, but chose that miner according to the proportion of work they did?  In other words, if there were 3 recent miners, and miner A had 75% of the work, miner B 20% and miner C 5%, then the fee would be randomly chosen but weighted 75% to miner A, 20% to B, and 5% to C.
Edit: would also not work well because it would require everyone to run p2pool.  Although I would guess it's possible to run a very lightweight script that only joins p2pool to collect the recent miner stats.

@_date: 2014-06-24 14:03:27
Note this is NOT the same thing as multisig, although it serves sort of the same purpose.
With Shamir's Scheme, the key to spend the funds does exist at one point in time (inside your browser) but then you only save the pieces and the whole key is destroyed when you close your browser (or power off the machine).
Multisig is better for when the funds don't belong to just one person (you can't trust anyone to generate the key and then destroy it after splitting it).
Multisig is a little harder to spend the funds (you need to create signatures rather than just collecting the static key pieces).  I suppose if you wanted to make multisig easier you could create the signatures in advance.  Still probably not as easy because it would require some manual intervention to create the transaction.

I don't see how the subsidy is relevant.
What matters is that bitcoin is secured by PoW.  That work costs a lot of money, otherwise it won't secure the network.
It's the same issue whether there's a subsidy or not.  Someone has to pay for that work, otherwise no one will do it.   Currently the true cost of the work is obscured by the subsidy (you don't have to pay, you get taxed via inflation).
The only way to pay less per transaction is to have more transactions on the network.

If you're in the US, that is how it is.  If you buy bitcoin online, they have to collect personal info and that's totally separate from making sure you won't reverse payment.  Both of these combine to make in a pain in the ass.
I also suggest localbitcoins.  Find a seller that takes cash deposit, and go to your local branch and deposit cash into his account. Or you can also arrange to do in-person transaction for cash.  You get bitcoin the same day, and keep your privacy.  There's a big spread between buyers/sellers on localbitcoin, usually about 10%.  So by posting your own ad (that you're buying), and waiting for someone else to accept it, you will get it about 5% cheaper than market price.  
If you're in a hurry, I suggest posting an ad to buy bitcoin for maybe 1% under market price.  It will probably be the best price by far, so anyone looking to sell would see your ad first.  If no one takes your offer quickly enough, you can just take someone else's offer (which will probably be about 5% over market).

Millions of bitcoin are not going to get lost.   Satoshi's coins are likely not "lost", he may have deliberately not spent them, but if he's alive then they're almost certainly not destroyed unless he did so on purpose.
The rest of the "lost" coins is much less than 1 million.  As bitcoin value grows, the number than get get lost will shrink, and the overall amount lost will approach some level but never exceed it.  
Assuming bitcoin is still around in 100 years (probably will be superseded by then), the total amount lost will probably still be less than 2 million.

There are plenty of use cases, just no implementations. 
I think that without transaction replacement, the channel can only go one direction (like for filling a gas tank, the amount owed can only increase). But that doesn't work so well for peer to peer apps. That's my novice understanding anyway.

This is the way API works, it's supposed to be a programmatic interface.  You can't have that if every transaction requires manual intervention from a 2fa device.
I agree that all these exchanges and services should make it more clear how badly you're breaking security when you set up API tokens.  But there's no simple way to make it secure, short of a 2fa device that plugs into your computer that the site can challenge automatically without your intervention.

Then there will be those who use bitcoin and don't ask anyone's permission.  That group will always exist, and they will outcompete those weighed down by regulation, and/or businesses that attempt to rent-seek or force you to trust them.

If you're worried about the masses being fooled by regulators and Silicon Valley, well of course they will be fooled.  There are some people who stubbornly insist on being manipulated and robbed.

No you don't


Yes, it will be illegal to do anything truly useful with it.  
What you are not understanding is that cheap/fast payments can be done far better by a centralized regulated currency.  If that's what bitcoin is depending on, it's as good as dead.  It will be slower and more expensive.
The reason bitcoin is slower and more expensive is that it is neutral and censorship resistant.  **That** is what you're paying for.  If no one is trying to censor you, you don't need it.
Censorship comes in lots of forms these days: chargebacks, seizures (including ridiculous fees), blocked payments, [edit: forgot inflation] etc.  


That particular mining pool, it absolutely will.  It will render their mining equipment useless.  It won't stop mining pools in general, that cannot be done.  It is not possible to prove that two entities won't eventually turn out to be controlled by the same entity.

I don't get it. 
This is how I understand escrow works.  You're selling a game thingy for bitcoin.  A transaction is created that sends bitcoin to you, if 1 out of 2 signatures are applied.  One one is his, and other is coinguard's.  
You send him the game thingy.  If he's honest, he signs.  If he tries to scam you, coinguard gets involved.  If they decide he got the goods, they sign.
The only way this can go wrong is if you send him the goods but the transaction's output doesn't go to you (it goes to him).  I'm not sure how coinguard works but it's some variety of this scheme.  I think you failed to verify that you would be the beneficiary of the bitcoin payment.  It was actually the seller who got the coins.  That's my guess.
@_date: 2014-12-16 16:54:20
The insurance company could hold the coins themselves, so that they would know if they were really stolen or not.

I see no difference in the two attacks in terms of "private key needed".  Both require two signed transactions from the attacker, one to give to the merchant or network, and one to the miner.
There is also no difference in pooling - a pool can perform a Finney attack just as easily as a solo miner.
The only difference is the 2nd one. Finney: time of attack can't be predicted but is very likely to work.  Bitundo:  attack is not likely to work but can be attempted any time.

If you mean someone with deep pockets who wanted to attack bitcoin even if it means spending millons, shorting is probably not going to do it.
They could try to 51% attack (and there are attacks that work with even lower mining proportions).  They could also try to tie bitcoin to illegal activity (esp terrorism) in an effort to get its use completely banned.  I'm not sure how well either of those would actually work.  I think if those with deep pockets and an interest in bitcoin's demise were confident these attacks would work, they'd have done them already.
To be honest, I don't even believe that bankers and politicians even realize the threat.  They might know that bitcoin would allow people to sidestep their authority, but they probably don't realize how difficult it will be to attack later.  If they understood they would have spent pocket change on miners last year to send the community scrambling for a new mining algo.  Would have either killed bitcoin outright or set it back years.

First of all, I believe it's true that today's society is far too dependent on "the big gun".  In other words, "do this, because if you don't, the big gun will come get you" (police, threat of prison, etc).  We do this even in instances where it is not necessary, where you can motivate people to behave a certain way with contracts and bonds and incentives, instead of threats.
So this means the state can be a lot smaller and have fewer roles than it does today.  I don't see how it's going to go away completely though.  Who's going to stop violent psychopaths?  I don't see how a collection of tiny organizations would handle this, aside from vigilantism.  In other words "we believe a guy who lives in your democracy club is killing people in our democracy club, so we sent a couple guys over there to kill him".  No trial, no standard of evidence.  Why should there be?  He's not a member.  The only way I can see any kind of standard existing is by forming very large coalitions of smaller clubs.  Starts to sound an awful lot like the state.

If you want to split the wallet, use the 'split wallet' tab in bitaddress.org (written by yours truly).  It uses Shamir's Scheme to divide the key and requires some threshold of shares to reassemble.  Much safer against theft than just making copies, and roughly as safe against loss.
For example, you can do a 2/3 split and keep one piece at home in a safe, another in a safe deposit box, and another with a trusted friend or relative.  Any two pieces can reassemble the key, but one piece is no help whatsoever in figuring out the whole key.

Sorry what are we mining in this scenario, bitcoin or an alt?
This all assumes that whoever comes up with the capital first is the first one to get the next miner first.  That is just not true.  Even if you have the capital you are not guaranteed by any means.  Half the mining companies fail to deliver altogether and it's not clear which ones will fail until after it's happened.  Others are just late.
Then there's the possibility that difficultly will increase so fast that even the first miner on the scene will not get ROI.  This is because of sunk costs, once a mining machine is purchased, it will be used until the marginal costs are higher than what it produces (its power use is more expensive than the BTC it mines).  Whether the machine will get ROI has nothing to do with it.  So it is entirely possible that every miner on the planet will take a loss for some period of time.

I don't know if that's better or worse than trying to add new features to bitcoin (so you can keep the existing ledger and infrastructure).  At first blush it seems worse - having to start over each time an important feature is created, causing all kinds of upheaval.
But if you try to incorporate new features into bitcoin, it's a lot harder for the inventor to profit from it.  The only rewards in the system are for miners.  I suppose the community could agree to pay the inventor somehow, but I doubt there'd be any consensus on that.  Bounties would probably not be sufficient either.

I thought so too, until someone pointed out that the Neo communicates directly with the merchant's POS terminal.  So for in-person purchases, it is probably secure enough.

No one should know which identities are tied to you, except you.  Or if there is a pressing reason to tie them together publicly, there's a very simple way to do that.  Just sign a message saying so.
Using the same identity everywhere is also not very good security, if you need to revoke a key it's better to have it be restricted to just one site.

GHash.IO, run by some random dude, was in a position to attack the network.  And you think it already is sufficiently expensive to attack?  I wholeheartedly disagree with you there.
However you are right that transactions could get a lot less expensive if the network can process more transactions than it currently can.  Theoretically that is possible and it is just a question of whether hardware and algorithmic improvements can keep up with adoption.  So yeah, I should have said that the $1-10 fees are not a foregone conclusion, just a possible outcome.

I don't know, I think that it is sort of absurd.
It's a completely informational currency with no physical representation, yet we're still trying to store it in bank vaults.  We don't trust the banking system with our money, yet we're still trusting them with our money.
I get it though, to secure bitcoin you need to either memorize a secret, or have some sort of physical security.  Banks are pretty good at the physical security thing.  Using them for that doesn't mean we implicitly trust the rest of the system.

Ownership of what?  Bitcoins don't even exist.  Have you ever seen one?  Technically we're just sending signed messages to a network, so no money is changing hands any more than when we send email.
The above is "technically" true and yet totally irrelevant to a regulator.  He will see that the system behaves in ways that are similar to a currency and regulate it accordingly.  We can try to dodge it by obfuscating the language but the odds of that working are basically zero.

These companies are going to realize that the only possible advantage for them to create their own currency is so that they can abuse it (by confiscating from their users and inflating the money supply).  They can't do that with a decentralized, trustless blockchain.
So either they're going to invent CorpCoin and run it on their own infrastructure, or they'll do the right thing and use bitcoin.  If they invent CorpCoin, people might take a passing interest in it, but eventually it will be no different than using dollars - it's controlled by someone else, uses insurance fees instead of real security, etc.
Personally I think all worries about CorpCoin and GovCoin are totally overblown.  They may come to pass, but they are exactly like the currencies that already exist, so users who go from dollars to CorpCoin are no different than users who just keep using dollars.  One way or another, eventually they'll see the advantage of bitcoin.

The odds of it working are at best 50/50 and practically, it's less than that, maybe 15% (assuming the vendor waits a few seconds).  Would you try to steal $2 from someone right in front of their face, if your odds of getting caught were 85%?

You're forgetting that you eventually have to spend those funds.  So you'll have to bring the data from the 2 usb drives together at some point, and decrypt them.  Then you are at the mercy of whatever machine you're using - if it's got malware, then you're screwed.
The trezor wins because it supports encrypting with a password also. So it's not just your seed that the attacker needs to steal, he also needs your password.  
The trezor wins again because with a password, you also have plausible deniability. Let's say you choose "foobar" as your password.  You can also log into your wallet with "password1". Trezor doesn't ever reject a password, it just shows you whatever wallet goes with your seed+password combo.  So you move $5 into the "password1" wallet, and your $10k savings into "foobar". If anyone ever tries to force you to open your wallet, you open the "password1" wallet.

If bitcoin needs marketing to succeed, those marketing slogans will necessarily be lies.
If it's superior money it will succeed.  
In a country with hyperinflation or account seizures, those who hold bitcoin will remain unscathed.  Neighbors and friends will ask how they did it.
Merchants who accept bitcoin avoid chargebacks and CC fees, lower their prices a few percent, to beat competitors.  Competitors will notice they're being beaten.
Same goes for transporting money across borders, sending small amounts to friends (splitting dinner checks), buying "unapproved" products and services, etc etc.

No **obvious** reasons.  His money is slowly being eaten away, but he doesn't realize it.  His 0.01% interest on his saving account doesn't keep up with inflation.  Everything he buys would be 1-3% cheaper if the merchant didn't have to pay fees to credit card processors.

So the signature is automatic then?  They don't make any judgments on the transaction itself to determine if it might be fraudulent?  Then I'd call this more of a third party security feature, one that users could also control themselves if they wanted.  The security comes simply from having to hack multiple sites.  This I have no problem with.
If the sig is not automatic, but rather based on some kind of judgment (hey this transaction went to this place we deem shady.  Blocked!) then I think it's a really bad trade-off because they can freeze your funds.
Inflating the money supply comes when you give your bitcoin to a bank such that you have no control over them at all, and they issue you some kind of account that you can debit from (the way a debit card works today).  At that point the bank can write whatever number into your account they wish and the underlying bitcoins are no longer yours.  This is how banking works today.  I have no idea why anyone interested in bitcoin would want it to work like the system it's designed to improve upon.

You're still comparing apples to oranges.
Are we talking about a currency or a payment system?  


You know perfectly well they are not free.  You pay for them one way or another. Bank accounts cost money, period.  There's lots of ways banks can charge: low interest rate, monthly fees, transaction fees, penalty fees, taxes, etc.  Just like bitcoin transactions are nominally 4 cents, but in reality they cost quite a bit more due to inflation via the block reward.


It is not so clear to me.  It's slightly faster and cheaper, but requires a bank account which is censorable, not private and not free.

I think the issue is not stealing from the wallet, it's producing receiving addresses that are owned by the developer, not the corporate wallet.

Not really, bitcoin does not allow anyone else to take money from you, you have to deliberately send it to them.
That's a feature - neutrality.  
The closest you can get is giving the merchant a series of timelocked signed transactions.  This doesn't stop you from moving the funds, but that's the same as recurring payments in the traditional system.

Bitcoin pays an extremely heavy price for its decentralization.  Think about it, the ledger is copied 50,000 times, the ordering of the transactions is determined by whoever wastes the most electricity.
The fact that fees are currently 5 cents is extremely misleading.  You are not paying  even 1% of the true cost of that transaction.  New bitcoin adopters are basically subsidizing the costs.  They're the ones buying the newly minted bitcoin, which is where miners get most of their income. 
If only you were willing to trust a centralized database to order transactions (you don't even need to trust it not to alter your balance, crypto prevents that), it could process 10,000/s for almost zero cost.  This is what something like opentransactions.org is looking to do, and they have other mechanisms to lower the required trust but it's still more trust than bitcoin requires.
Anyway, banks could implement something like that and blow bitcoin out of the water.   In the future bitcoin will not be able to claim cheap/fast as a value proposition.

Don't get me wrong, it's better than nothing.  
In this case it's looks like they're using biometrics in place of a password or PIN.  The wristband itself is the physical security token.  Compared to just locking the wristband with a PIN, the biometrics is inferior IMO - it's just security by obscurity.  It's entirely predicated on the assumption that your heart biometrics are impossible for an attacker to read.  That may be essentially true today, because an attacker has no motive to develop a device to circumvent it.
And what happens when the attack is eventually successful?  It's absolutely catastrophic.  Anyone who uses heartbeat biometric authentication, whose biometrics are compromised, can never use that mode of authentication anywhere again for the rest of his life.
Compare that to using a PIN where if you suspect someone looked over your shoulder while you entered it, you're still safe - you still are in possession of the device and you can change the PIN.

Go fanatics seem to be mostly happy with Go's tools, the language is kind of 'meh'.  It may be more readable than C++ but ... so are plenty of other compiled languages.  
Take a look at conformal's code.  You see "if err != nil" lines OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER.  Maybe I'm just accustomed to higher level constructs but the presence of this much repetition in supposedly "clean" code, does not reflect well on the language.

In a few years (maybe 3, maybe 10), you won't be able to buy a drink with bitcoin at all (the fees will be much higher).  I used to think there was some way to make it work, but there's not.
Somebody has to pay for all that electricity that secures the network.  Right now, there are so many new adopters that the inflation caused by block rewards is irrelevant.  But eventually that party will be over.  The block reward halves every 4 years or so, and eventually it will not be enough to support the level of mining that is necessary to secure the network.
At that point, the only way to keep the network secure will be with higher fees.  Bitcoin will become the backbone settlement network, the transaction fee will be higher than the cost of your drink. Somewhere between $1 and $10 fees are possible.
You will be buying drinks with some kind of cryptocurrency for sure, but it won't be bitcoin directly.  It will probably be a more centralized, trustful mechanism.  After all, it's pretty easy to give a little bit of trust with a small amount of value.  That way we can buy cheap stuff for very low fee and very low risk.  For example it might be an OpenTransactions issued currency, denominated in (and backed by) bitcoin, with voting pools.  That's plenty secure for your beer money.
Your savings may remain in bitcoin directly, though.

Look, if you think the US government isn't going to fight bitcoin, you're nuts.  Of course they are.  The only question is, how compelling will bitcoin's case be?  Will it be enough for people to just ignore the government and break the rules?  The government may try some propaganda campaign to turn public opinion against bitcoin, but that's their only hope.  If popular opinion says bitcoin is cool, then the government won't be able to just go around arresting everyone who uses it.  Just like Amazon.

You are delusional if you think we're the impatient ones.
It's the big blockers who are impatient - they have to appeal to the public "RIGHT MEOW" and "there's no time to scale keeping censorship resistance intact! Just spew micropayments everywhere and don't worry that nobody can verify all the transactions! I'm sure miners would never print money arbitrarily even though it'd totally be in their best interest and it would be difficult to catch them!"

If I'm not mistaken, bitcoin's wealth distribution is more equitable than the dollar's.
So, securing bitcoin is not easy today.  I don't think that will remain a problem forever.  Most of the problem stems from the fact that general-purpose computers are being used to secure it.  We can already see this doesn't work because general purpose computers, by their nature, tend to end up executing god-only-knows-whose instructions.  You can't trust them with any important secrets.
Dedicated hardware isn't perfect either, you end up having to trust the manufacturer to a large extent.  But once that trust has been established, there's not much else to it.  The trezor's design cuts off pretty much every other avenue of attack.  Attacks can still happen, but they'll be much more expensive and criminals will focus their efforts on weaker targets.

I'm not so sure about this.  Bitcoin prices are cheaper because it's irreversible and there's no insurance.  These are bad things for the customer and good for the merchant.  Hence the merchant compensates the customer.  It's basically break even.

I admit the whole thing is sort of a solution looking for a problem.
Either the "evil" pool owns the hardware or they don't.  If they don't, then these decentralization techniques are sort of helpful, but really it's not that big a problem in the first place - as soon as they do something evil, the hardware owners will take their hashes to a different pool.
If they do own the hardware then all these techniques are useless.  As stated above, there's no way to know if two pools that appear separate are controlled by the same party.
However I think there is still value in making p2pool a "first class" citizen - then bitcoin users (I think) can at least see what fraction of the hashpower is using a neutral mining policy AND encourages users to reward that neutral policy.

Yes, I think that was clear from the material coinapult presented.  "Locks" is just a marketing term for an exchange where you can only withdraw bitcoin.  You list balances in (say) gold, you have actual gold reserves on behalf of customers who switch to gold.  You just don't let them withdraw gold.


Good, as I said I think this is a great service. I am afraid though, that what will happen is inexperienced users will flood in, and cause a massive bubble where they all rush to unlock as the price goes up, which causes the price to increase further.  And inevitably, the last people to unlock lose a massive amount of value.  Sure, this is exactly what has happened before on other exchanges, but all those inexperienced users **knew** they were trading bitcoin.  They just weren't very good at it.


I know this is marketing material so I know total honestly is a bit much to ask.  But I think the main benefits are quick and cheap transactions.

I never suggested that onename.io should be part of bitcoin core.
But namecoin and name registration in general is a perfectly fine tool and one that can be used in conjunction with bitcoin.  
For a payment protocol you need more than just namecoin, I agree.  To handle look-alikes, see robohash for an example of the general solution.  You either just use the face for recognition, in which case the hash function must be expensive so that nobody can brute force a look-alike.  Or you can just use the name+face. 
This is superior to certificate authorities in many ways.  It requires a bit more effort from the user but it's a lot safer.

If 50% of the nodes have bad ledgers, any of them that tries to send you a payment it will simply be rejected by your node and it will not show up.

Anonymity on the bitcoin network is complex.  
You **can** be anonymous (using tumblers, for example).  And even if you do nothing to be anonymous, it's not like it's spelled out in the blockchain whose address is whose.  That takes good old fashioned detective work to figure out.  Not too many people are interesting enough to the government (or anyone else) to warrant that work.

Couldn't we do this today?  Instead of including a fee (by leaving some amount unspent), just specifically pay the fee to a miner's bitcoin address.
Only difference is the fee wouldn't be destroyed if it were mined by someone else, it would actually still go to the original miner.
Still, I think it would have much the same decentralizing effect.
Edit:  what if everyone's bitcoin client automatically included a small payment (fee) to the say, 4th largest mining pool?  Wouldn't that encourage miners to flock from the largest to the 4th largest?  Of course it's not really that simple, there's no easy way to tell who the 4th largest pool is.  But there may be some good-enough way for nodes to come up with a smaller miner to support.

I think the government's response will eventually come to attempting to destroy the internet as we know it.

That's not a response to bitcoin, but to the internet, just decades late. I don't think they are going to make the same mistake again.

It's basically because all other forms of payment are reversible.  As a minor, you'd theoretically be able to deny responsibility for the payment and actually have it reversed. Although I'm not sure this happens very often in practice, that's definitely what coinbase wants to avoid.

Bitcoin goes for secure and decentralized, which is IMO the correct choice.
Using human-readable names will be inherently insecure.  It will be too easy to use similar names to confuse people, the continued success of phishing attacks shows how easy this kind of attack is.
I thought about this some more, there may be a way to avoid Zooko's Triangle, it goes something like this.
Create a hashing algorithm that takes a name as input and outputs a face image, sort of like robohash:  
On the wallet app, you show the name AND the face.  That way, you can't fool people with a similar name - the face will be totally different. 
Now, then there's the issue of brute force searching a similar face.  You'd have to make this hashing algorithm extremely slow to prevent this.  Sort of like BIP38 prevents brute forcing passwords, this will prevent brute forcing similar hashes.
@_date: 2014-02-21 20:11:10
Interesting, hadn't thought of that.  
You load it with $1000 and 1000 mBTC.  The machine tries to avoid running out of either one, essentially guessing at the worldwide market price without actually knowing it.  So the initial price is 1:1 (not including fees).  If someone buys bitcoin, it raises the price continually (so the per-unit price would actually go up the more you buy).  Conversely, if they sell bitcoin, the machine lowers the price continually.  
One would expect that if the machine got significantly out of whack with real market prices, someone would just come along and do arbitrage to return it to equilibrium.
I like it.
Now we just need two-way ATM hardware that is cheap enough for anyone to deploy.  We already have a 1-way for $500.  I figure a 2-way needs to accept bills in a way that it can re-dispense them, that's probably going to add a lot to the price - maybe a few thousand not including solar power and a tamper/theft proof housing.  Seems doable in theory :)

Entrapment may not be the right word, since it means you induce someone to commit a crime they otherwise wouldn't have committed.  Perhaps I should have called it a 'sting operation'. 
You're much more knowledgeable than I about whether someone can be tricked into double spends, so I'll take your word for it.
But what about the mafia scenario?  The reason why double-spend 'mob rule' doesn't happen is because it would immediately destroy the whole network and the value of the miners' product.  I'm not so sure that would be the case under your proposal.  'Mob rule' to steal miners' block rewards wouldn't directly affect anyone except miners.  Would end users even care?  They might not, unless they foresaw that the victimized miners would eventually quit, and the security of the network would slowly decrease.  That concern is not as obvious as double spending.

Best comment so far and they downvoted you.
The best way to promote bitcoin is to leave strangers the fuck alone.  When you buy things, ask if they can give you change in bitcoin.  Do not ask a merchant to accept bitcoin.  He'll consider it a negotiation to get him to accept something less valuable than his original asking price.  In other words, why should he want the bitcoin when you obviously don't?
The other way to spread the word is to let your friends see how cool it is, you don't even need to tell them "hey i want to show you something".  Just go to lunch at a place that accepts it and pay with bitcoin without saying a word.  Let them ask you about it.  
If a friend owes you money, tell him you prefer to be paid in bitcoin.  Never make an unsolicited offer to pay anyone in bitcoin.
Edit: tipping may be an exception but I think it's better to tip someone as a real tip (for providing some service), and not just giving away bitcoin to try to convince the recipient that it's cool.

Has other issues besides trust issues.  The biggest one I know of is that it treats all issuers of a particular kind of debt as exactly the same value.

$200 doesn't seem unrealistic to me.  We're speculating on the eventual consensus size of bitcoin, it's either huge or zero.  The odds of each one happening are really anyone's guess.
Personally I think bitcoin is undervalued just on this basic calculation.  If it's huge, value is about $100,000 each.  That's 200x today's value.  That means the market is saying the odds of full success or even partial success is 0.5% or less.  I think it is substantially higher than that, 10% still seems a bit conservative to me.

How long you need to wait depends on several things:
* How much you trust the payee not to attempt a double spend
* The ability of the payee to perform a double spend (mining capability)
* How much is "a lot of money" to you
* The value of your time at that moment
* The consequences for the payee if he gets caught trying to double spend
* Who controls the bitcoin nodes your wallet is connected to
If $5000 is not a lot of money to you, and you're late for your plane, then waiting for 4 confirmations doesn't make any sense.
"how much money is a lot to you" could just be answered once and the wallet could remember it. There are some cases where you're going to have to sit around and wait anyway, just to be safe, so you might as well answer some questions from your wallet software that might let you shorten the wait:
* Do you trust the payee not to try to defraud you?  (Yes: immediate green light)
* How much would you be willing to pay right now to make this fully confirmed instantly? (higher percentage of "a lot of money to me" = faster greenlight) if you're not in a hurry, you'd say zero.
* Are you reasonably sure the payee doesn't control a large amount of bitcoin mining hardware? (Yes: greenlight based purely on amount)


Really? Who sends items by mail literally 5 minutes after receiving payment? Why would you do that, since it won't get the package there any earlier than waiting an hour?

There's plenty of anti-counterfeit techniques.  But this is an interesting one, assuming you could get the same digest every time, even after wear and tear. And that there is enough entropy in the digest that you couldn't brute force attack it with a machine that cut lots of wood pieces until it found a match.  
The fact that you could use a microscope to verify is a nice perk but rather impractical for anything but very high value amounts.  And without a microscope, I would still guess that a motivated hacker could come up with some material that would fool the naked eye.  The chinese produced fake eggs.  Until I heard that I would have thought it would be trivial to spot a fake egg.  Apparently not.

I don't see how any of that solves the fundamental problem of people trying to cheat and commit fraud.
No matter who's deciding whether to return the money, if I'm a cheater, I'll find a way to cheat.  I'll order something and say I never received it.  Or if I'm buying bitcoin with a cash deposit, I will claim that I deposited the money (even though I didn't).  When the arbitrator asks me for proof I'll show him a faked receipt.
The fundamental problem is that while you can prove bitcoin was sent and received, you cannot prove the same about the goods or money that were given in exchange.  Those are all subject to fraud.  This problem has no solution.  Better arbitration is going to be more expensive arbitration.

So let me get this straight.  
I can by 17,000 out of 4 billion shares of safecoin, for 1 btc?
That means for $500 I can buy a 0.000425% share of the coin?  That is absolutely ludicrous.
That's the equivalent of buying bitcoin at around $10.  Bitcoin had survived and grown for two and a half years before it reached that value.  Nobody was paying that on day 1.  And actually for safecoin, it's **before** day 1.
I'm sure there's a bunch of suckers out there who will buy any new currency, and it sure seems like maidsafe is a great tool.  But that doesn't automatically make safecoin a smart investment.

Yes, and yet this is precisely what will transpire with bitcoin.  It's already happening.  The US government declares bitcoin currency or a commodity, whichever is more convenient for it at that moment.  Absurdity already abounds.
I don't think bitcoin will, in any way, escape regulation simply by avoiding the words "money" or "currency".  
Regulation is coming.  The organizations that are submitting to it today will simply be made irrelevant by those that don't.  This will be a fight and there's no avoiding it.

The masses are not coming.
Bitcoin is disobedience.  That is its one ultimate purpose.
Yes, transactions are currently fast and cheap.  But bitcoin will force competition there and ultimately lose.  Centralized technology will be faster and cheaper because there's no problem of consensus, there's just one authority.
Bitcoin wins on censorship resistance.  It will force competition there also.  Authorities will be forced to allow things they otherwise wouldn't, because they can't stop people from disobeying.  
Equilibrium will be reached where the price of going through the authority is somewhat cheaper but somewhat higher risk of censorship.  The masses will still go through the authority, but bitcoin will be for "higher risk" users. It will be what prevents the authorities from being overly restrictive because the bitcoin option will always be there.

I disagree.  Gox was an amateur outfit and everyone knew it.  It's better than having no exchange at all. There would have been no exchange if all those regulations had to be followed in order to start one.

Basically they'll pass a law forcing ISPs to only route traffic to/from approved sites like Facebook, Amazon, Google, etc.  Everything else will be completely blocked.  You will not be able to run your own server software of any kind, whether it be for mail, chat, gaming, blogging, etc.  It will become impossible to communicate directly with another individual on the internet.  You will be able to communicate only through an approved third party (who of course will turn over all your communications to the government if they ask).  You think this is an alarmist scenario, keep in mind we're fucking with the government's power and money.  They will stop at nothing to prevent that.

Yes. but the miners are in a weaker position.  The users can just sit tight, they might not be able to do any transactions because of a 51% attack.  But the miners are losing their income by mining the chain that will eventually lose.  No miner in their right mind, is going to mine a chain that the majority of nodes considers invalid. 
I think it would be VERY difficult for miners to collude to force users to switch to their chain (their rules).  The less hashpower on the user's chain, the more profitable it is for a miner to defect to the users' side.  A miner cannot mine both sides at once, he has to choose.

I think you are missing my original point (that multisig is not a panacea).  People might think "oh, since greenaddress does the 2nd sig, I can just use my android phone to buy stuff and it'll be more secure than any other android wallet".  But it's not.  You need the 2FA with you, and if it's not on a separate device, you don't have much extra security (if any at all).
But I definitely agree that when you **do** use separate devices, multisig does add extra security over a plain android wallet.  However if you're going to involve 2 devices anyway, I'd rather just use a 2/3 multisig and not bother with greenaddress's timelock service.  We just don't have good multisig wallets yet.
Right now I just have 1 secure device (trezor) instead of 2 or 3 insecure ones.

What cost? It costs almost nothing to configure backup pools.
Still I agree the tragedy of the commons applies here.  I think there's benefit to rewarding a neutral mining policy.  I'm not sure how to do it, but what I talked about earlier sounds plausible.  If in fact p2pool is not easily corruptible (seems like it's not), and there's a foolproof way to reward neutral miners such that they **know** they'll be rewarded.
I'm not even sure if we should make consensus on what "neutral mining policy" means, part of the bitcoin consensus.  I think an opt-out checkbox seems harmless enough, but I haven't given it any real thought.

A large business stands to lose millions in bitcoin, but can't spend a tiny fraction of that on a consultant?
Cold storage is not rocket science, finding someone to handle it is not expensive.  It only gets complicated when the business has to pay out unpredictable amounts of bitcoin - like exchanges.  Too little in the hot wallet, and customers have to wait and they get angry.  Too much in the hot wallet is a security issue.
But a regular business that has a fairly predictable demand for its product?  They can accept bitcoin and pay their employees in bitcoin, without a lot of complex security.

I'm pretty sure the insurance is for the card holder, not the merchant.
When there is a fraudulent charge, Visa forcibly takes the money back from the merchant.  Visa could not care less whether the customer's card info and the merchant's info about the customer match, they don't ask.  They reverse the payment regardless.
You do not even have to report the card stolen.  You just say you didn't authorize that charge.  A thief does not have to have the physical card to make charges, that's what so ridiculous about the system.  That's what allows hackers to steal millions of credit cards at once.

If you're going to convince them it's important you have to point to real damages that lack of privacy causes.  Not just privacy for the hell of it, because other than enthusiasts like us, nobody gives a shit.
Edit: so the real damage of using personal info for credit card security is not that we're afraid someone will know our name and address.  That's already public knowledge.  One real damage is that someone out there will accept it as proof of identity and loan money to anyone in possession of it, expecting the subject to repay the loan.  **That** is the problem, not lack of privacy.  Another real damage is that when banks compile your purchasing history they can use that knowledge against you to block your transactions or seize your money or worse.

If that's not what the consumer wants, then any attempt to market to him is useless anyway.  And if that *is* what he wants, then there's only one place to get it, he'll find bitcoin.

That's definitely a concern I have too.  But I can't decide whether that's realistic.  It's going to be awfully easy to use the real deal in a couple years.  I can see banks offering "bitcoin" accounts (the quotes are because it's not bitcoin, it's a promise to pay bitcoin that ultimately is no different than any other fiat currency).  But the banks are going to have a hard time screwing people with massive fees and restrictive policies, when the people can, with minimal effort, just use their handheld device to become their own bank.

As cool as the ATMs are, I am not going to use them if I have to provide ID.  
I'd like to see someone take a chance on an unregulated ATM.  If no one ever empties or replenishes the cash, and the owner just collected fees in bitcoin, the government couldn't catch the ATM owner.  The best they could do is seize the machine.  
Of course the only way to never have to mess with cash is to use already-deposited cash to dispense.  So the use of the ATM would have to be fairly balanced (if most people used it to buy bitcoin, the cash box would eventually be full and the machine could only buy bitcoin from then on.  Or if most people sold bitcoin, the machine would quickly run out of cash and couldn't do anything but sell).

I've worked on the bitaddress.org code myself (submitted patches and reviewed patches).
The code is very straightforward, not very large, and you can read it yourself and be satisfied there's no backdoor.  But you don't even need to do that.  Even if there were a backdoor to capture your keys and send them somewhere, it won't work if you generate your keys offline (which is recommended anyway).
There is really only one possible attack vector (assuming you create your keys offline).  And that is for the attacker to try to guess the random seed for the PRNG.  A lot of effort went into closing any possible holes there.  The latest version of bitaddress.org
* Captures mouse movements to generate entropy
* Forces you to generate enough entropy before creating keys
* Shows you the seed pool as it is being generated so that you can see the random data being created
I believe it folds in more than 128 bits of entropy, so basically you're safe from brute force attacks.  The key is totally random and there's no chance at all that an attacker can guess it.
The github issues for bitaddress.org show all the discussion around the PRNG improvements, if you're curious.

Just because I can register "amazonn.com" and trick some people into thinking it's Amazon.com, doesn't mean DNS is a "dangerous service".  Having to remember "amazon.com" is a lot easier than memorizing an IP address.
Onename.io is the same kind of service.  As long as you remember a party's registered name, you can look up all kinds of OTHER information about them (like their bitcoin payment address, website, public key, etc).
Edit: you seem to think that there's some way to guess a person's information without them communicating it to you securely.  There isn't!  However we can at least compress what needs to be communicated down to something small, and easy to remember.

They don't by themselves, but to hit the kind of transaction rate Gavin Andresen was talking about, the block size limit has to be raised.   That means the CPU and bandwidth requirements to run a full node will increase.  That will reduce the consensus size (because you can no longer run a node on Tor, or on more modest hardware or mobile connections).  Those who are knocked out will no longer be able to run "trustless" and will have to trust someone else to validate transactions for them.

Horribly insecure things appear to "work", for a while.
Security is not convenient, and nothing will ever change that.  The most convenient thing is to not have any PIN on your smartphone yet millions of people do have one, because they now understand the risk.  10 years ago, almost nobody's phone required an unlock code.  Now their intimate information is on there, and they are willing to accept inconvenience to protect it.  The same will happen with bitcoin.

Except this isn't how mining works.
When mining, you take the transaction data, and then add a nonce (this would be the number between 1 and 100 you mentioned).  Then you hash the whole combination, and hope that the resulting hash meets the difficulty requirement (that it starts with a bunch of zeros).
There's no guarantee that ANY of those 100 hashes meet the difficulty requirement, that's just a property of hash functions.  You cannot predict the output for inputs you haven't already tried.  The same holds true no matter how many inputs you try, or what the difficulty is.  The odds you'll find a block obviously increases when you try more inputs and the difficulty gets lower, but the odds are never 100%.

If you could derive anyone's secret key from their public key, then public key crypto wouldn't work, and neither would bitcoin.
I believe that this property of the secret key containing all the info you need to get the public key is not common to public key crypto in general.  For example, that is not true of PGP keys.

It probably *is* the far future where the block reward ceases to be much larger than the fees collected.
Right now there is a block reward of 3600 bitcoin per day, and fee revenue of about 15 bitcoin per day. Fees are about 0.4% of total revenue. Assuming fee revenue stays the same:
* 2016: 0.8%
* 2020: 1.6%
* 2024: 3.3%
* 2028: 6.6%
* 2032: 13.4%
* 2036: 22.7%
So it will be as late as 2032 that fees will be fairly insignificant. If fee revenue increases, well, that just makes bitcoin MORE viable, not less.

It basically is the finney attack, but backwards.
In the Finney attack, the "evil" miner waits until he finds a block and then defrauds the merchant.  This requires that he can choose the time of his purchase to coincide with when he finds a block.
In the bitundo attack, the "evil" miner just accepts that his attack will usually fail (and fail silently).  This allows him to mount the attack anytime, but just with a much reduced chance of success. He just ignores his own broadcast transaction and inserts a double spend into the next block (if he manages to find it).

There's no device ID, as far as I know.
In order to show you your transactions, it takes your HD public key and scans the blockchain looking for transactions related to it.
You could wipe out your trezor and create a new HD wallet, and their service should not be able to link the new wallet to the old one.
There's other ways SPV nodes get a bit of privacy (they don't just ask for the specific addresses because that links all of them together, they ask for some that they don't actually own to add uncertainty).  I don't know the details of any implementation, including bitsofproof, but I believe it is not as big of a privacy violation as you suspect.

You have to back up your auth tokens if the service you want to authenticate with has no way to reset them.  
Any 2FA app that doesn't work like this, I would be very suspicious of.  The whole point of 2FA is this token proves it's you and not someone else.  If there's a way to reset it, there's some other way an attacker can pretend to be you.  IMO, the most secure way to do 2FA is have no other way to auth and don't lose it.

What penalty? At worst your computer consumes some extra resources for a while having to handle both forks. But even then the resources used should be about the same as before the fork.
The only way you can be seriously penalized, is if you trade coins unequally on the two forks. For example, if you sell your "fork a" coins and buy "fork b" coins, and then "fork b" ends up losing, that will cost you.
But no one's forcing you to do that, you can just hold both of them.
Edit: maybe you're talking about miners? Yes, then they definitely have to choose carefully, otherwise the coins they are mining could become worthless in the future. They cannot mine both chains at once (at least, not with all their mining power).

I don't see how. Either the multisig is signed immediately (in which case the input to the locktime transaction can be moved elsewhere - the recipient has to trust the sender until the locktime expires), or the sender waits to sign, making locktime pointless.
@_date: 2014-08-30 12:07:49
Right, we both sign. The funds move to some output address which is not multisig. The key to that address is owned by whom?  
The problem you haven't solved here is that the funds can still be moved before the locktime expires. The only way to make the locktime transaction the only way to get the funds is by destroying the private key. That is impossible to prove.

Bitcoin can't do anything to safeguard physical items.
However it certainly can reduce crime. There are lots of cases where you normally would have to trust a 3rd party to hold your money, and they could steal it.  Bitcoin and related technologies makes that impossible, so that whole class of crime will cease to exist.

There's nothing to match up.  Your node does not care what ledger other nodes have.  It only cares about its own ledger.  That's what makes it trustless.
Your node has a set of rules, the main one being, "if my ledger doesn't show the source address having the funds it claims to have, or doesn't have a valid sig, then it's invalid".
When someone broadcasts a transaction paying you, it doesn't matter how many other nodes think it's valid.  What matters is if YOUR node thinks it's valid.

Is the worry that someone replaced the entire piece of hardware?  If that's the issue then there's really no way a box is going to help you.

When answering the question "am I paying the right person?" there are several things that can happen:
1) You don't compare anything.  You just assume the address/name you see is correct.  This is not secure and no system can fix it.
2) You compare the name/address you see with one you've seen before (and the one you've seen before is the correct one).  In this case, bitcoin addresses are secure but they are a bit cumbersome to compare.  And they're basically impossible to memorize or recognize.   Names, on the other hand, are very easy to memorize but not very easy to compare - similar names can easily fool you.

Yeah, the distinction is bothering me less and less.
A virtual machine is a simulation of a real machine.  A video game virtual world is a simulation of real world physics.  However the idea that virtual is just a cheap imitation is starting to go away.  Video game worlds are more impressive than the real one in many ways, virtual machines can do things that real machines cannot.
For everything we normally care about, a virtual machine **is** a machine.  We don't care that it has no physical form, that it's only simulated in software.  It does exactly what a real machine would do, plus some other things.
So bitcoin being called a "virtual" currency might imply that it's a simulation of a currency, but doesn't necessarily mean it's inferior.

Of course no rational person would ever want Amacoins.  They are basically just Amazon's promise to pay, and OP's convolutions do not change that essential property.  They are Amazon Gift Cards in disguise.
As long as Amazon is doing perfectly honest business, they make no money from their promises to pay.  Of course they do not do perfectly honest business.  Amazon themselves will not redeem unused portions of gift cards for cash, so basically a few percent are never redeemed, or force owners to buy something from Amazon that they don't actually want.
Amacoins will be essentially no different.  Amazon would either lose money or they would have to cheat people to make money.

I think this question can be rephrased as, "will another coin come along with a feature that is so essential, and can't be incorporated into bitcoin, that it's worth dumping bitcoin's much larger consensus"?
Anonymity is certainly such a feature, however it does seem to me that bitcoin can incorporate it (via coinjoin or some other method).
The feature would probably have to be completely incompatible with bitcoin's ledger, I can't even think of what it might be.
The other risk is that the community will simply fail to execute even though it's possible for them to do so.  This gets less and less likely over time - there is too much vested interest in it succeeding.

What does "decline in mining" mean? 
It is not only "the cost of mounting a 51% attack" divided by "the total market value of the network". Just because that value is currently x, doesn't mean we have to maintain x forever. It's possible (likely) that the network is currently oversecured. 
The reason we can get to a state of "oversecured" is, there is a very big gap between "my rig will never recoup its initial cost" and "I am turning off the rig because it costs more to run than it generates". Those two events can be a year or more apart. In between, the network is oversecured.

That does sound like it would put a time limit on the 51% attack, but practically it still seems like someone who could afford the attack in the first place, could still keep this up for quite some time - weeks, months? 
Even that wouldn't kill bitcoin, it would just shake confidence. Honestly I don't think the 51% attack is a realistic threat. If the motive is to kill bitcoin, it won't work. If the motive is to profit, it likely won't work (edit or it may panic the market once or twice, but that's it). The only motive is just to grief bitcoin users, and not too many people have tens of millions of dollars to waste on that.

I am still trying to digest 
But, I **believe** that this would work.  The idea is that you use the parent key to prove you own both the compromised key and the replacement key.  
What I'm less sure of is to what degree the "chain code" prevents others from deriving **all** the descendant keys (thus connecting more of your identities than just the two you indended).  If I understand the document right (and I'm not sure I do), without the chain code, nobody else can derive the rest of the child keys.  But then I'm not sure how you could prove that the parent key is actually the parent of the two keys you care about.  I don't know if actually deriving the key is the only way to prove the relationship.
But there's still a way around this even if you can't selectively reveal parent/child relationships - you can just manage your keys such that there's a different parent key for each site.  That way, revealing the public part of it doesn't connect your identity on that site to any other site.

I was almost 100% sure the halting of withdrawals in the Chinese markets was going to cause a panic. I reminded myself "don't try to time the market, just hodl". But I kept thinking, "I'm very sure of this, I need to sell now, if I don't I'm going to kick myself as the price tanks". But then it didn't. What seemed so obvious was wrong, and I'm glad I didn't act on it. I held and it worked out fine.
The price zooms up and down, it's impossible to predict when it will happen. I mean, sure you can gamble on it, but if you're going to gamble, do yourself a favor and use a real provably-fair gambling app. If you use the markets as a casino you're going to get shitty odds (you'll get eaten alive by insiders and whales). What's tempting about the market trading is that you feel like you have some control, but this is an illusion. If you make a trade, it should be on something you think you know that others do not know.
If you're hodling, it's probably because you believe bitcoin is undervalued. There's lots of money to be made on this - think about it, banks are still fucking around with "blockchain tech" because they still don't understand bitcoin. We may not want to admit it, but these bankers are actually smart people and it is taking them years to digest bitcoin concepts. If you actually understand what bitcoin is (what it's good at, and bad at), you have an advantage in the market.

If you're referring to colored coins or merge-mined chains, that can only work if the tokens are worth much less than bitcoin itself (or whatever the native token is). The PoW mining is only protecting the value of the native token, you can't piggyback something larger on it. So you could not, for example, put the US presidential election (in which trillions of dollars may hang in the balance) on the back of bitcoin where a 51% attack costs a few million a day.

I still have hopes for bitcoin's unit of account becoming reasonably mainstream. Most people don't need the censorship resistance (or don't believe they need it), but they may want to invest in others' desire for censorship resistance, and they may be interested in a unit of account that's worldwide and not tied to any particular jurisdiction.
However, one thing I'm certain of is that as long as censorship resistance is relatively expensive (which will probably be always), people won't pay for it unless they actually need it. This is muddied by the fact that Visa is overpriced garbage (electronic payments could be ridiculously cheap if it wasn't for the corrupting forces of regulation). Bitcoin is currently competing with Visa on price even though it should not be able to.

No, that makes no sense.
Today Joe will have a bitreserve account denominated in dollars, and he pays everyone in dollars (even if they have a bitreserve account).  At what point is he going to switch over to denominating his account in bitcoin?  NEVER!  Even if everyone he interacts with has a bitreserve account he'll never be able to pay any of them in bitcoin because none of them accept it.
There is no way around it, if you want to use bitcoin you have to expose yourself to its volatility.  Bitcoin is never going to be a way to send dollars to someone else (especially someone in the same country as you).

That is a totally different point than the one I'm making.
They may learn about how bitcoin works, but they'll still think of it as worthless monopoly money.  
Take a look at this - I think it is a powerful demonstration of how trying to get rid of something convinces people that it is worthless:
In the video a guy offers to sell a 1oz gold coin for $25.  He asks many people on the street, no one accepts his offer.  They assume the coin must be worth less than $25, because if it was worth more, why would the guy sell it for $25?
Same psychology applies to bitcoin.  If someone is giving it away, it must be worth nothing (or less).

Wow, you really missed my point then.  The whole reason I'm accepting such a meaningless discount is precisely because we owe them. But they have to give me **something**, even if it's just a token discount.  We owed them more when they were taking a risk on bitcoin but every passing day it's less of a risk.  Quite frankly it was never much of a risk to begin with, just the effort to add another payment option to the shopping cart - bitpay does the rest.  The balance of power has shifted toward us significantly since overstock's announcement six months ago.

It does gain *some* knowledge, not a lot.
Because it doesn't reshuffle after each digit, if it sees you click the same place twice, it knows those two digits of your pin are the same.  So if your pin is 1111, the host computer has enough info to guess your pin in, on average, 5 attempts.
Even if all your pin digits are different, the attacker can rule out all pins that have repeats of a digit.  That's not a fatal weakness, but it's there.

I've had previous discussions on this sub about this, and I've heard it argued that for all practical purposes, it doesn't matter if you have to rely on others to choose the correct chain, because you do that anyway with bitcoin. Personally I don't buy this argument. 
Yes, you do have to decide where to download the bitcoin software in the first place, and if you choose wrong, you could end up on a different chain that everyone else. And you could even choose the right software, but be partitioned onto a minority network.
However it still seems like a much lower hurdle to clear to get the right answer than it would be with PoS. With PoW, you only need to choose the right software once, and thereafter the only requirement is that the most-work chain is not withheld from you by ALL the nodes you can contact. In other words if any of the nodes you can reach is honest (and you don't even need to know which), you'll be on the right chain.
Even the software choice is not arbitrary - you can examine the source to look at how it selects peers and decides on the winning chain, to make sure it does what you expect. Then you can compile and run it yourself. Ok, in practice hardly anyone will do this, but that fact that it can be done does matter. With PoS, you can get screwed multiple ways - you can choose the wrong software which chooses the right chain initially but later ignores what should be the "true" winner. Or you can choose the right software but still get network partitioned. Or you can choose the right software and be on the main network, but still have to choose between competing histories, both initally, and after any long-term absence from the network.

Fortunately the idiots in this sub have little to no effect on bitcoin's direction.
Don't worry, it's too late to put the genie back in the bottle.  Bitcoin, the idea of a neutral currency, won't die as long as there are those who believe in it.  If the current implementation of bitcoin veers to far from that ideal, then some people will fork.  I don't think it will come to that though. Bitcoin's neutrality is its whole value proposition, greed will motivate all bitcoin holders to ensure that value is not destroyed.
Not everyone realizes yet that neutrality is bitcoin's value proposition. Many still think it's cheap/fast transactions.  But I think the community in general is figuring it all out. There are TONS of misconceptions that have been eliminated in the last few years, I'm actually very impressed with how fast things have progressed.

What you're proposing is just using signed messages for authentication, the same kind bitcoin happens to use.  That's great and I am a huge fan.
It doesn't involve transactions or the bitcoin network at all.
Nobody is going to want to use their "connect with bitcoin" address for actual transactions because of the privacy leak.  
I just don't think it makes any sense to use your wallet for authentication, if you care about privacy at all.  What we really need is an identity management application:
* Derives all your keys from a single secret
* Keeps track of which identities you use for which sites (encrypted so no one else knows)
* automatically signs messages for the right site with the right key
* Can even present a signed public key (signed with a master key for that site) so that if your key gets compromised somehow, you can create a new one signed by the master key, and the site knows to revoke the old one and use the new one.
This is sort of along the same lines as SQRL but more generic.

The idea that bitcoin will grow with the needy sounds nice but it's not going to happen. 
Censorship resistant money that can't be blocked, seized or arbitrarily inflated, isn't cheap and there's no way to make it cheap. Every transaction requires electricity for PoW, bandwidth to be propagated to thousands of nodes, CPU power for verification, and long term storage. If they could afford this, we wouldn't be calling them "needy". What possible motive do Venezuelans have to use bitcoin instead of dollars (or literally any other currency besides bolivars)? I'd argue they have none. Their problem is that their entire economy has collapsed, it's not like their government has a policy against them buying food and has banned local payment processors from handling food payments.
I think bitcoin as a unit of account may be gaining traction - if your currency is hyperinflating, you're probably not too worried about coinbase seizing your funds. Coinbase has its problems, but they have not been taking their users' money. At worst they just forcibly return it and close their account.

I think it's hilarious that people are saying that institutional investors are waiting for total safety.  It's not going to happen, and still leave room for profit.

Just as no one could have stopped satoshi from creating bitcoin, no one can stop you from forking it. Conversely no one can force you to stay on a fork or accept a fork. It actually is all about choices - you choose the rule set, and by extension the consensus. 
I think bitcoin forks should be a regular occurrence at this stage. It's just like an altcoin, but not a premine scam!  If altcoins are acceptable, bitcoin forks should be also. It's a little harder to come up with good names, but that shouldn't stop anyone.

Yeah, I never mentioned the case where you have NO backup. I was talking about where you have the backup in an insecure location (someone else might read the seed).
The idea being that a password is easier to memorize than a 24-word seed. It's less secure, but if you can detect that someone's read the seed (even if you can't stop them), you at least have a good chance of moving the funds before the attacker brute forces the password.

Yes I could censor all of them, for however long I can afford the attack.
If I'm a 51% miner, as long as I can sustain the attack, any block mined by the other 49% on my chain, will eventually be orphaned (because I'll just start building on the block before theirs and since I'm faster than them, I'll eventually build a longer chain and orphan theirs).
So yeah technically the transaction would happen, but everyone would know it would soon get rolled back, and so practically it's as if it never happened. No one in their right mind would accept that payment.

Unless there's more to it than that, I still think it's a dumb idea.
These devices will be essentially an unprofitable mini-mining operation. Why even bother? Wouldn't it be easier to just sell a device with NO miner, just a wallet with bitcoin already loaded into it by the manufacturer? And then include the cost of the bitcoin in the price of the device?
It is WAY easier to have a website that lets users reload bitcoin on all their devices at once, than to try to build wasteful miners into every device. Yeah sure it sounds cool for the devices to "earn" their own bitcoin, but they won't and can't.

Delays are not relevant because they're not spending the bitcoin immediately after payday.  Limits are not relevant unless you are extremely wealthy.

I think should just code up the fork, test and release it. He doesn't need anyone's permission, that's the beauty of bitcoin.
Then at some point, possibly in the next year, blocks will start filling up and either the current bitcoin network will become difficult to use or it won't. 
I don't see the point of debating what will happen. Just release a fork and we'll find out.
"But double spends!"  Yeah, we'll have to deal with it. You'll have to demand payment on both forks as long as it's not clear which will win. It's a pain but it won't last that long.

In a bitcoin client, I can look at the source for how it selects the winning chain.
There's no equivalent in PoS. It doesn't select the winning chain at all! Someone else does. There's no predicting what that someone else will say.
Yes, there's unfortunately some trust involved in everything - we can't even be sure our computer hardware isn't secretly backdoored to lie to us about bitcoin chains. I don't think that necessarily means that adding even more trust to the system is ok.

I think this is the right answer. I don't know what we should call it, but micro-bitcoins (or bits) is the best unit.
Sure, a modest house today costs 150 million bits, but that's not terribly hard to deal with. As others have said, Korea already has a similar sized unit.
Worst case (or best, depending on your point of view), bitcoin goes to $1 million and a bit is $1 and we're back to the same size units we deal with regularly now.
If bitcoin went *down* in value significantly, well, that would likely mean nobody is using it anyway, so that's not a real concern for the units.

Still, implying isn't enough.  "Full access" is easy to misinterpret as "full read access", even though users should err on the side of caution, they've been trained by years of apps that can't really do anything particularly harmful.  So they tend to just grant permissions without much thought.  
Until that cultural norm goes away, warnings need to be very explicit.

I'm not afraid of success, I just don't think that growing as fast as possible is the way to accomplish it. Bitcoin needs to slowly creep in, to become coveted by government officials (as a personal want, not as official policy). It can do that as a niche product. Once it's "under the skin" so to speak, then it can grow.
However I think you underestimate the true cost of censorship resistance. It's never going to be able to compete with visa (and the like) on cost. Imagine creating an internet from the ground up like a meshnet, one that couldn't be taken over by governments. It's going to be SLOW, period. It's never going to compete (edit: on speed) with centralized ISPs and undersea fiber cables. This is just the reality and we have to accept it. There is not going to be a single solution that wins in all categories.

You fact that you freaked out the way you did, shows you have some serious misunderstandings about how these wallets work.

Oh, I think regulating bitcoin will be **extremely** effective, if the government is willing to go far enough.  
They just pass a vague law that can really be applied to any currency, and just selectively enforce it on bitcoin.  Any company accepting bitcoin payment is fined or shut down.  That's the end of bitcoin in the legitimate marketplace.
It will continue underground, most likely.  I'm not 100% sure of that - it just depends on whether its properties still make it superior to fiat despite the fact that you can only trade it with other criminals.  That's a pretty high bar to overcome, but it's possible.
Will the government go that far?  And more importantly, will they go that far **before** people start demanding bitcoin?  Probably not, technology moves fast and government doesn't.

Hm, couldn't you just make the winner the one with most work and the fewest repeats of bitcoin blocks? 
In other words, take the competing chains, and compare them at equal depths (edit: starting with where they diverge). If one has a higher bitcoin block than another, keep the higher one and discard the other chain. If you get to the end of the chains and there is still more than one remaining, then that would mean all the bitcoin blocks are identical and you could would have to look at the sidechain's work (determining the winner the same way bitcoin would with two chains of equal length).

The most important thing, in my view, is to stop seeing forks as a "worst case" outcome. Sure it would be great if everyone agreed all the time, but we have to face the fact that consensus won't always happen, sometimes the pressure to split will be greater than the cohesive forces. 
I think the community is so eager for bitcoin to stabilize and take over the world, that they ignore what's holding it back. The system is just too complex to really know what's going to happen when changes are pushed. Consensus and discussion are clearly valuable, but 3 years of discussion is way too long.
I don't want to sound like I'm some TLA spook trying to fracture bitcoin, I would rather the 20mb change just get consensus. That isn't going to happen without some kind of push - either a fork or imminent fork.
Personally I think there's a high chance the dissenting devs will change their minds when they see it's going to happen with or without their blessing.

That's actually the only thing keeping it alive, being too small to be worth attacking head on. Bitcoin cannot withstand a full-on assault by governments, and it never will be able to. The US dropped a trillion dollars on a single pointless war against a non-threat. Imagine what the world governments could spend to fend off a threat to their ability to finance all future wars. Bitcoin only survives by being a minor annoyance rather than an existential threat. If bitcoin became a target like Islamic terrorism became a target, it would quickly cease to exist. The goal here must be to stay small enough to avoid that scenario - to be an annoying horsefly, not a life-threatening smallpox.

Good point. You could make a shorter, but winning, chain that way, with the method I described.
Obviously I haven't worked out all the details :) Still feels like there is an algorithm which will reliably select the right chain.
What if you compared the chains for the most unique bitcoin blocks included? Your new chain in that case would have skipped a block in the bitcoin chain and would soon get re-orged out by a more honest chain.
Of course, skipping is sometimes the honest thing to do (when two bitcoin blocks come out very close to each other). But cheating here doesn't really give any advantage. It puts the cheating chain behind - it picks up older bitcoin blocks but honest chains are picking up the latest ones.
@_date: 2015-05-28 14:46:50


No, I'm correct even if there is only one exchange in the whole world. As long as that exchange trades both forks then all is well.


That example is irrelevant because mtgox chose one fork.
If one exchange doesn't fill the demand to let people trade two forks, an exchange will come along to fill that demand and take people's trading fees. Maybe Elacoin was too small to bother with, but bitcoin will not have that problem.

All I can think of is that they want to eventually control the majority of the hashing power to start bending the network to their will.
After all, the owners of these devices will clearly have **no ability whatsoever** to control the mining policy of the device. It will all be controlled centrally by 21. We already know the devices mine precisely because they don't want users to have to understand bitcoin. So they will mine exactly how 21 sees fit and no other way - which means when 21 wants to delay transactions by their competitors, they will tell their army of devices to begin doing so.

Off blockchain means "inflation happens here". The whole point of bitcoin is you verify all transactions yourself to make sure the money supply is not being inflated.

I think this is a good illustration that, most people's estimates of bitcoin's location on the acceptance curve is grossly overstated.
It's still very very early.  Access is not the right metric.  In 1990 very few people had any internet access, and today billions of people have access to bitcoin (because it requires little more than an internet connection).  So some might say bitcoin is the equivalent of the internet in 1996.  But access isn't really the point, it's ease of use, and perceived value. Today bitcoin is hard to use (and extremely difficult to secure), very few people see any value in it at all. (What do I need bitcoin for? My credit card is easier to use, and there's no volatility).  
Today bitcoin is extremely niche, it's for enthusiasts and for those who are willing to put out a lot of effort to resist censorship.
That's because all the applications that it makes possible, haven't been built yet. 
There is no reason at all for the average person to use bitcoin today, except maybe as a risky investment.

This is not a realistic fear. Either the institutional coin (let's call it e-coin, to borrow from Mr. Robot) is controlled by the institution, or it isn't. If e-coin is controlled by the institution, it's not anything like bitcoin - it's just dollars and Visa with a fancy veneer. If e-coin is not controlled by the institution, then what is their motive to push it? They have nothing to gain, and users have no reason to switch from bitcoin to e-coin.

This is just a social issue (agreeing on names for the two forks, since both will probably want to continue using the original name but that will cause confusion). As far as an exchange is concerned, it might as well be a new coin. The fact that they have a shared history shouldn't matter to them.

Panicking the market works maybe 2-3 times at most, and then everyone knows it will recover and won't sell. Then that class of attack can be considered "closed".

Some of these apply to even "anonymous" coins like Monero. It doesn't matter if your payment is untraceable if you use your shipping address.
The rest can be mitigated by coin mixers and/or privacy-aware wallets. Bitcoin doesn't really need anonymity built in.

My guess is, whatever USMS is going to announce has already been leaked to well-connected traders and the market price already reflects it.  In other words, the coins sold for about $650.  Makes sense, since that was the market price before the sale was announced.

This isn't "phishing", it's a trojan.
Phishing is when you get someone to log into a site they think they're familiar with, only it's not the real site.  It's a fake site that captures their password which the attacker uses to take over their real account.

Personally, I think it's $1142 on Bitstamp, a few minutes ago.
The $1163 on bitstamp in 2013 was clearly influenced by the Willy shenanigans even though they weren't directly causing it.
There are lots of people who will say that mtgox criminal acts didn't influence the price that much, but I disagree. I think bitcoins were being purchased on mtgox with promises to pay fiat that could never be fulfilled, and of course when those users went to withdraw fiat in fall 2013, they could not. Because that money never existed, it was made up out of thin air, either by Karpeles or a hacker.
In my mind, the entire Nov 2013 bubble was completely fraudulent and artificial. If you erase it from the chart, bitcoin's growth looks quite steady.

For pete's sake.  Whose fault do you think it is that bitcoin is hard to get?  
There are two main reasons bitcoin is hard to get.
1) Bitcoin is irreversible and banking/CC payments are NOT
2) Banking/CC use requires following money laundering and tax regulations.
Neither of those are bitcoin's problem, they're the banking system's problem.  You've got it all backwards.
Edit:  and guess who profits the most?  Those who worked hard to acquire bitcoin when it was hardest to get.  In the beginning there weren't even any exchanges, you had to find someone on IRC and it was really technical and painful and difficult.   But guess what folks, bitcoin is now as easy (in terms of how much work you have to do) to buy as it will ever be.  It will never get easier and may even get harder.  However the cool stuff you'll be able to do once you have it will only increase.

You can't tell how secure an RNG is without looking at how the numbers are produced. If you can't see that, then you are taking the manufacturer's word for it that there's any entropy there at all. For all you know, they can trivially reproduce ALL the random numbers produced by all their chips, themselves, without even having to know the serial numbers.
@_date: 2015-05-19 12:04:01
This is simply not true at all.
You have to trust that the RNG is secure. If it isn't then it doesn't matter whether you can extract the keys directly from the device. The manufacturer doesn't have to! They know how to reproduce the "random" numbers and therefore, your keys.

I would still consider it growth, even if new users displaced old ones. There's a lot of people using bitcoin for pointless reasons. It used to be satoshidice spamming the blockchain just because they could. Now they've been priced out, but there are still people buying $10 items that can easily be bought wth other means, and don't require censorship resistance. Those people also need to be pushed out, and replaced by larger holders who actually need what bitcoin is offering.
It may not end up with much wider adoption, but the quality would improve, as would users' satisfaction with bitcoin.
Bitcoin is never ever going to replace visa. The sooner people who want that are priced out of bitcoin, the better.
@_date: 2014-07-08 19:17:02
I'm sorry but that is ridiculous.  First of all the high level design work has already been done, conceptually there's no reason it can't be coded up and work just fine.
But even if it can't, so what.  To the degree that bitcoin can serve as your everyday "buying a snickers bar" transaction settlement mechanism, it will.  However far it can scale, it will.  Beyond that limit, something like OpenTransactions will step in.  It's not totally trustless, but certainly good enough to buy a snickers bar.  A good wallet will make the experience seamless.

So? The whole reason bitcoin works at all in the first place, is that miners profit more by mining honestly than by attacking.
The same principle applies to a fork with the non-majority of hashpower. In theory the majority could attack the smaller fork, but why would they? They're just in it for profit. If they believed the smaller fork would eventually win, they'd be much better off just mining it honestly. If they thought the smaller fork would lose, they would be best off just ignoring it.
Am I supposed to believe that someone else (state-sponsored, probably) is going to attack a small fork but NOT the larger one? I find that incredibly unlikely. 
Basically all the fears of forking are completely unfounded.
Edit: thought experiment. Say you and a few friends privately coded your own fork, and bought a few thousand dollars worth of mining equipment and starting mining your own chain. Who is going to realistically attack your chain? No one gives a shit about it and is not going to waste money attacking it just to win cool points on reddit. The odds are in your favor here. And the same thing goes at any scale.
@_date: 2017-02-28 23:45:09
Yes, but the companies who make those products could not give less of a shit about their users, so they wouldn't use blockchain tech even if it was right in front of them. They refuse to say whether you own a physical object or a license. It's just whichever is convenient for them at the moment. Copied a CD for a friend? "You can't do that, she doesn't have a license!". Scratched your licensed CD and want a replacement for just the cost of the media? "Too bad! You bought a physical CD, buy another one". 
I feel sorry for people who buy these products. The reason these companies treat their users so poorly is lack of competition. If you don't like the DRM in photoshop, well, it's really the only game in town.

I think you're vastly underestimating. Look at the order books. There's about 15,000 BTC on the books to move the price by 10%. You're talking about demand for 300,000 BTC - 20 times that amount. It's going to move the price by a lot more than 30%. I'd say about 500%.

It's certainly a step forward, but I am still wondering how you are going to be sure that the address delivered to the Trezor by whatever host it's connected to, is actually owned by the person you want to pay.
I know the payment protocol is implementing some kind of certificate authority scheme, but didn't we learn from SSL how badly broken that is?  Seems like trezor works great for buying in person, but it won't protect you from malware on your own machine when buying online.
If you have malware on your computer, you'll have no way of knowing whether the payment displayed by the Trezor is actually going to the person you intended.  You'd have to have some side-channel communication with that person/company to make sure the name matches exactly - otherwise a hacker/squatter could use the name "Jim Bob's store" when the real name is "Jim-Bob's Store".  You'd have no way of knowing because the malware would just say "Our payment protocol identifier is 'Jim Bob's store'", the hacked one.
Theoretically hackers could do this with existing sites, just overwrite your firefox binary with their own.  The hacker browser shows "amazon.com" with the SSL lock icon, but is actually connecting to a cloned site that collects your credit card information.  I am guessing the only reason this isn't being done is because it's so much easier to steal credit card data via other types of attacks (eg, 110 million at a time by attacking Target).
Ultimately you have to be able to trust your OS unless you have a secure channel available somewhere, which for nearly all e-commerce, you wouldn't.

The collision has little to do with bitcoin, I don't think normal transactions use SHA1. The two colliding files were pdfs.

Yes, of course if you wish to change rules, you have to change software.
As for VB's "camp spawning", I'm not convinced. It seems to assume the attacker has more resources than everyone else combined. Well, if that's the case the attacker will win no matter what, whether it's PoW, PoS, or anything else. The only way to prevent those types of attacks is to grow so large that such an attack becomes prohibitively expensive, regardless of the consensus algorithm.

Number 9 (unhackable passwords) was solved decades ago by public key crypto.  Web shops and consumers are just too lazy to use it.
Bitcoin already does it right - requiring signed messages to transfer money.  The "password" (your private key) is never transmitted to anyone and need never leave your control.  It should ideally reside on trustworthy hardware like a yubikey or trezor, but a dedicated old android device where you have one app and disable the radios, might do in a pinch.

This sounds like a bunch of nonsense to me.
First of all, a mining pool is NOT a single actor. It's composed of lots of different miners with different values, any of whom could leave the mining pool at any time, at no cost.
Second, aligning economic incentives matter more than sheer numbers. Having lots of different parties doesn't matter, if they all disagree with you (for example on the issue of "should bitcoin be 51% attacked").  If you answer "no" and all miners answer "no", and won't change their mind, then you are safe even if there's only 2 miners. Conversely, if you answer "no" and 51% of them answer "yes", you're screwed no matter how many of them there are. In reality people do change their minds. But having more parties involved does not necessarily mean it's less likely a majority of them will change their minds. If collusion becomes economical, then collusion could happen on any scale.

I think you're saying the same thing I am, unless I misunderstood.
A full node can tell the difference between an invalid chain with more work, and a valid chain with more work. The SPV client cannot tell the difference, right? But somewhere, a full node **will** know. I'm saying all it takes is for that one full node to publish something somewhere saying "fraud detected" and everyone running SPV will know they have a problem.
My point is that the attack can be foiled by a single honest party, so unless miners have confidence there are none, they are unlikely to attempt this kind of attack.
I know SPV clients make it easy for the network to tell which transactions belong to it (which raises privacy and censorship concerns). But there are techniques to mitigate that concern (although I'm not sure if they're currently part of the protocol).

Mytrezor knows everyone's xpub keys, which is centralization.

It was really cool that we could all run full nodes as long as we have. But those days are ending. Just let em go, it's much better for bitcoin (and by extension for you) that way.
SPV security is better than most people think. In order to attack you on an SPV wallet, there would have to be NO VALIDATING NODE ON EARTH that you would trust to raise the alarm that miners had gone rogue, and started hashing on invalid transactions. 
Off-chain transactions require far more trust than SPV - even if they are denominated in bitcoin, they will either have the same scalability issue or they will allow a 3rd party to inflate the money supply. If there were a way around that, then someone would already be doing it.

This is a false analogy because hash cash and e gold never really worked. Bitcoin has already proven that the technology works. A bug or mistake doesn't change that. 
I could care less about most "bitcoin investment" because it's actually investing into the traditional banking system, or worse, a direct attack on bitcoin.
Coinbase is a bank. Bitwage is a bank. These things are what bitcoin seeks to bypass, so investing in them is not investing in bitcoin. It's investing in the interface to the legacy system. 
Chainalysis is a direct attack on bitcoin.
The legitimate investments are wallets (hardware and software) - which don't really depend on bitcoin itself - they're likely easily adapted to whatever cryptocurrency happens to become the frontrunner. Then there's layers on top of bitcoin (using bitcoin's strong transaction ordering functionality to put other events in order, like stock trades, etc). Again this could be fairly easily adapted to whatever becomes the frontrunner.
If current investors don't realize this, I really don't care. They'll eventually be replaced with more savvy investors.

I think it's pretty clear that this is completely wrong. 
If bitcoin were only used to move money, there's no increase in demand long-term. The user buys bitcoin, sends it out of China, sells bitcoin, for a net of zero. As long as the amount of Yuan fleeing per day remains constant, it should have no effect on the price of bitcoin. There will only be more bitcoin "in flight" (and hence higher demand overall) if the pace of capital outflow increases. 
And this is all assuming that wealthy Chinese are really doing this, which I doubt. There's plenty of other ways to get money out of China. My guess had been that what we thought was demand for bitcoin was really demand for unregulated gambling. However if that were true, there should have been a selloff if all the gamblers were forced out of bitcoin. So I'm honestly not sure what the major attraction is to bitcoin in China.

This is the best strategy.  Ignore.  The regulations are irrelevant and unenforceable.  Bitcoin services will just migrate to the most welcoming jurisdictions. Nobody can block NY residents from using them, nor should they try.
Really all these regulations can do is prevent holders of NY bank accounts from buying bitcoin (and even then I don't think that will be enforceable).  That is also easily skirted, there are plenty of online-only banks.
Edit: obviously there is enforceability on NY-based companies.  If you're thinking about incorporating in NY, don't :)  There are 49 other states and nearly 200 other countries.

I don't see how it wouldn't. How do miners know which block size is acceptable to non-miners? Nodes can be trivially sybiled. From what I read on BU's website, miners are depending on **other miners** to figure this out. The only feedback is orphaning blocks. Well, somebody has to be able to figure out who, if anyone, has been left behind by a too-large block size, and I could not find any description of how it will be done. So basically a majority of miners could decide to leave everyone behind and force them onto SPV clients. Sure, a majority of miners could 51% attack too, but that's more economically devastating than pushing users onto SPV.

Trezor sort of blurs the lines between cold storage and everyday use.
You can use it for both.
Generate the seed, put a copy of it in your safe, and perhaps another copy in a safe deposit box.
Create a password for your cold storage.  Put that somewhere safe also (perhaps a different place). ~~You don't need to type it into a computer, you can generate it with dice and just write it with a pen~~.  Edit: well, you sort of do have to type it into a computer eventually to get an address to send your coins to :)
Create a password (or several) for your hot wallet(s). You can keep this in a password manager like LastPass.
Now the device itself is taken out of the safety equation. You can lose it, it can be stolen, and your coins are still yours.
Your cold storage is safe, because your password is elsewhere (even you don't know it, presuming you haven't memorized it, which I don't recommend). If someone threatened you to open your trezor, they would only see your hot wallet.
I have cold storage that predates my trezor, so I have no reason to move it yet. But if I were starting today I would not bother with traditional cold storage (paper wallet etc).

You have to have some kind of control. And satoshi labs HAS IT. They're the only ones (so far) who know what they're doing. With a cheap knock off, you get what you pay for. Sure, someone who only has &lt; 1 bitcoin may not want to pay $119 no matter how much better it is. But that is true whether the knock off exists, or it doesn't.

Bitcoin **is** disobedience. If your acquaintances are put off by disobedience, they are really in the wrong place.
It's not up to them to decide who we're allowed to disobey and who we aren't. "It's OK to disobey monopolies like Western Union, but disobeying the federal government is NOT COOL".  No.  It doesn't work like that.  Bitcoin is neutral, it doesn't care who you're disobeying.

Anyone who pays 1100btc for this is out of their fucking mind.  Even if it was still loaded, that is an insane price.
Either bitcoin will be worth $100k in 10 years, or nothing.  If it takes off, this bar will be valued far less (in bitcoin) in the future.  If it crashes, both the bitcoin and the bar will be worth very little.
So regardless of which you believe, this bar is a terrible investment.  If you are bullish, keep the bitcoin and buy the bar later.  If you are bearish, dump your bitcoins for something that will hold value.

There is no "community".  Is there a "community" of dollars?  No. People who accept dollars have nothing further in common. Same with bitcoin, they have nothing in common except the rules for validating transactions.  
Drug dealers accept bitcoin. Drug dealers accept dollars.
Newegg accepts bitcoin. Newegg accepts dollars.
See how there's criminals and honest businessmen in both "communities"?  
The average Joe is not in bitcoin's target audience. He will do whatever the television says. The financial system commands him to divulge all his activities, pay $45 overdraft fees, taxes, tells him what he can and cannot buy, who he can and cannot buy from, etc etc and he obeys. He laughs at bitcoin as useless, because he cannot even conceive of disobeying. He's happy the way things are. Great for him.

What exactly is the problem?  Mining can't be unprofitable for everyone indefinitely. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 16:22:28
Black market users couldn't care less about volatility, they don't need to hold bitcoin. They have to have bitcoin, though, to buy what they want.
For buying everyday stuff when you already have a bank account and debit card, well, bitcoin's case is far less compelling. I am as big a fan of bitcoin as anyone, and I do not use bitcoin to buy everyday stuff, even when it's easy.
Why don't I?  There's no economic motive.  Using my debit card costs the same and is much easier. Merchants like Overstock and Newegg are saving money by accepting bitcoin, but they don't pass those savings on to me. Yet.  When they do, I might have a reason to use it, and so might a lot of other people.
Bitcoin's story gets even more compelling in other countries where the local currency is unstable (eg, Russia right now) and they can't avoid volatility either way. Or countries where bank accounts are not easy to get.

I believe this is wrong. It doesn't matter how many blocks the data is split into, the miner can overwhelm the bandwidth of other miners.
There has to be a limit (either hardcoded or economic), otherwise miners with the highest bandwidth will be incentivized to knock other miners off the network.
I like the proposal (that i heard from ) to limit block size economically. So, the client would stop relaying transactions and blocks for free, it would require a micropayment channel be opened with its peers. Peers could exchange block-for-block (or tx for tx) the same way bittorrent does. Or if one peer just doesn't have any fresh data to trade, it could use bitcoin instead. 
That will stop miners from trying to artificially inflate block sizes, because a huge block will cost more to relay, and will be less likely to be relayed by nodes that can't or won't pay for it. It will necessarily cost more to relay, because any client that chooses to relay it will have to give up relaying several smaller blocks (due to bandwidth limitations).

Despair is setting in but I don't think we've hit bottom yet. I'm guessing around $150.
Remember, if you take away speculation, the actual utility value of bitcoin today is what, five bucks each?
Also note that adoption has basically stalled, most people have heard of bitcoin and, for now, could not give less of a shit about it. They're happy with their fiat, bank and credit card.
What I think is going to happen is many of these people are eventually going to get screwed somehow by the traditional banking system - theft, blocked payments, reversed payments, seizures, inflation etc. Bitcoin will keep getting mentioned, and at some point in their frustration, they'll take another look, and realize bitcoin might help them.
This takes time.  However I don't think the price will take that long to recover - the market will soon see this is what is happening and price it in.
I think the hype cycles should get longer and longer. Now it is going to take more than "X company accepts bitcoin" to get any attention. There's going to have to be something like  that is actually available in enough places that people see it in action. And/or a thriving black market that the FBI is unable to shut down.

Trading anything for anything else is a gamble, you could always end up regretting the trade. Whether it was actually an investment really depends on the intent, which markets are not concerned with. You can enter orders on exchanges without specifying a reason. That's why manipulation isn't a real thing. The only difference between a sale and a "manipulating" dump is intent.

I agree, it's a race between bitcoin and regulators.  The bitcoin community is prettying up the space on the other side of the fence, making it more and more enticing for citizens to make the jump.

Bitcoin is not just a currency. It's a payment system that competes with Visa, and it's also a currency that competes with dollars. Payment systems do indeed have logos, and for good reason. Merchants who accept that payment system, can show that they accept it!

You can't tell whether a valid-looking utxo set is the result of 100% valid transactions without applying them all yourself. What if one of the sigs in one of the txs was invalid but the miner included it anyway? You'd be trusting other miners to detect that and orphan that block.
@_date: 2017-02-23 15:14:04
That may work up to a point, because there is no feedback. Eventually though, there would be feedback in the form of users just not sending the transaction at all, because the fee estimate was too high.
The problem happens when everyone is trying to get "market" price but no one is making offers (all 'takers', no 'makers'). In order for offers to happen, some users must be able to choose a "low priority" option, where they are shooting at below market price and hoping it will eventually be accepted.

This seems like a description of "Why Central Banks Will Race to Adopt Digital Cash". It makes some convincing arguments there.
The part that seems to be missing is, why would they specifically need to use the blockchain? The Fed *could* just issue digital dollars on their own centralized service, as anonymous cash so they wouldn't be able to trace where it went (no liability). 
Also, what proportion of cash is used *because* it's censorship resistant, versus because it's accessible and cheap? I have no idea, but if it turns out that 99% of cash is used because it's cheap, then central banks probably wouldn't care whether their new digital cash is censorship resistant.

Functionally it's more or less the same, but I'm talking about design principles here.


That's simply not true, AFAICT. We just needed a way to pay miners and the native token was a convenient way. It wasn't strictly necessary. If miners accept some other form of payment, that's up to them - why couldn't they?

The whole point of a physical coin is no one knows the private key, it's sealed inside the coin.
Of course, so far that is not possible.  We have to settle for either the creator of the coin or the first buyer of it, is the one who knows the private key.
At least with the former, it can potentially be a trustworthy person.  When the first owner of the coin knows the key, you have no way of knowing who he is or whether you can trust that the funds will still be there when you buy his coin and later want to redeem it.

Exactly. Relative to pigs and goats, currency maintains a stable value! Therefore, if you sell a goat for $50, you're gambling that the price of goats doesn't immediately increase. Conversely, if you buy a goat for $50, you're gambling that the price of goats doesn't decrease.
Bitcoin isn't a great currency now, obviously. The question is whether it can be one without regulation. Of course it can. It just has to be large enough so that the price is difficult to move, just like the dollar and oil (which have nothing preventing large entities from manipulating them either). Heck, the Swiss Franc just got manipulated clear as day, it still works fine. Some people lost money, but that's life - value is subjective.

Governments would just switch away from income tax to other taxes that are forever anchored to the physical world. For example - property taxes.

I think that there is currently no known way to prove that you sent something.  I'm not sure that is really necessary, since most communications are two way, and with something like SSL the "connection provider" would prove his legitimacy because he's sending back to you bytes that properly decrypt with the correct SSL cert.
So a system where the "provider" lets you send/receive a few bytes for free and then starts charging you might work, although even that seems open to abuse.

Bitcoin can't protect colored coins, unless the value of all the colored coins is smaller than the bitcoin network. (Mining difficulty is roughly proportional to bitcoin's price, but knows nothing about colored coins).
Given that, how can this scenario ever play out?  I suppose a few small countries might be able to fit their currency in as colored coins, but the larger central banks seem out of the question.  If bitcoin was large enough to protect the Fed's colored coins, bitcoin would already be the world's reserve currency, wouldn't it?
IIUC, dollar M0 money supply is several trillion. If the fed issued even 10% as colored coins, bitcoin price would have to be at least $20,000, probably more?

IMO, the debate is not about whether bitcoin can scale without sacrificing security and censorship resistance. It can't. 
It's perfectly valid for someone to want a cryptocurrency that is maybe not as secure as possible, but secure enough for **them**. Nothing wrong with that. The debate is essentially over who gets to keep the name "bitcoin".
Does bitcoin occupy the "as secure as possible" niche, or the "as secure as we can get with huge blocks" niche?
Personally I think if any cryptocurrency should occupy "as secure as possible", it should be bitcoin. It doesn't make sense for it to move somewhere arbitrarily in the middle of a secure&lt;-&gt;scalable continuum (leaving the left end open for something else, and Visa/Paypal on the right).
The bitcoin name should be synonymous with security. Scalability is already taken.

Here's the inescapable reason: There are no commas on the right side of the decimal. You can clearly see the difference between 100,000 and 1,000,000.  But the difference between 0.00001 and 0.000001 you can very easily overlook.  There's a clear advantage to using smaller units.

As far as I know, untraceable digital cash doesn't require any accounts. All the server does is take an unblinded token and sign a new blinded token, no identification is required. 
If the Fed were to run a centralized digital cash server, why would they do it any other way?


I'm just not seeing how the pressure could be applied to their centralized chaumian cash server, but NOT to their colored coins issuance.
Wouldn't the law enforcement organization just say, "Stop issuing colored coins and run a centralized trackable ledger instead that requires government ID".
I admit that's far fetched, but it's far fetched in both cases.  Cash is still around.  I think that if the pressure to kill cash was sufficient, it wouldn't matter how it had been implemented.  There's still a central point of failure - the issuer.

I I think this argument falls a bit short when you examine it closely.
If the new software is a fork of bitcoin (meaning, it uses the same ledger history), then it's not "supplanting" bitcoin, right? It will still be a store of value no matter what happens (one fork could win, or the two could coexist, but the total value should remain about the same).
How is this different from an altcoin? Well, the only difference is what happens by default. In a fork, the default is a 50/50 split of your existing investment among the two forks. With an altcoin, the default is a 100/0 split. 
However I would argue that the default is almost never what anyone wants, in either situation. Rebalancing would be necessary anyway. Shapeshift.io and similar services make it very easy to rebalance (you're already out of the fiat banking system, so there's no friction).
The fact that we're already out of the fiat banking system, means that the lines between cryptocurrencies is a lot blurrier than the lines between dollars and yuan, or between silver and gold. Edit: holding a basket of cryptocurrencies that auto-rebalances is a very simple piece of software, a script basically. That basket should be a store of value regardless of the shifting landscape.

Set a hard fork date in the future. Update the software to reset the difficulty on that date, and change the transaction format (making core's txs invalid on your chain). Then on that date, whatever miners want to join your fork, start mining your blocks. Core's blocks disappear because they're all invalid on your chain.
Would such a fork ultimately be successful? It depends on whether its changes are actually valuable to users, which is exactly what it **should** depend on. What a few developers (or miners) think is irrelevant.

Available source is not open source.
You see, there's a big difference between having the right to READ the source, and having the right to MODIFY it and distribute the modified version.
The new license revokes our right to modify.  For example, I can no longer legally make a change to trezor's firmware, and publish it on github for you to compile and install.
Of course, it's still quite easy to do, it's just not legal.
That's why this whole thing was an incredibly stupid move on the part of SatoshiLabs. It fucks over their users and doesn't do anything whatsoever to stop trezor clones.

That's far from certain. In fact, I believe it'll be just the opposite. As mining chips hit up against the limits of efficiency, they'll start to become a commodity product. Once that happens, the individual miners starts to gain a huge advantage - he can reuse 100% of the waste heat (in a hot water heater, for example). A datacenter can't do that, so it doesn't matter how cheap their electricity is or how much economy of scale they have. They can't beat 100%.
Granted, that 100% number only works in cases where the heat would otherwise be generated by some other electrical device, but there are plenty of those throughout the world.

It helps relay blocks and transactions, but there's no direct benefit to you unless you are receiving transactions yourself. In that case, you can verify that you have been paid, and (unlike many wallets) you do not need to trust the majority of miners.
The reason most people have trusted miners so far, is that they have very rarely produced invalid blocks. I think there's only been a handful of them in all of bitcoin's history, and I believe all of them were accidentally invalid, not a deliberate attack.
However just because SPV security has been enough in the past does not guarantee it to be so in the future. So running a full node is the best you can get to be sure a payment you receive will not be reversed and that you'll be able to spend those coins freely in the future.

Personally I think that any altcoin that doesn't start with bitcoin's ledger (think of it as a bitcoin hard fork), has no chance to overtake it.
Bitcoin was a fair start because it rewarded those who had the foresight to predict cryptocurrency in general. That is just not even possible to do anymore because bitcoin has already proven the concept. Alts are either premined (obviously not a fair start), or pump-and-dumped instantly.
Anyone who wants to stick to the ideal of a neutral currency will have to stay with the bitcoin ledger.

I bought my first coins near the peak ($20+) in 2011, although not nearly 25k worth.
Then it plummeted and was hovering around $2. I thought "maybe I should buy more?  Nah, it looks like it's never going to recover".
So of course it did recover and I felt like an idiot.
I ended up buying more, but not until the recovery was clearly happening at around $15. I could have had 7x more coins.
I think the best buy signal is when people are talking about bitcoin being dead (again). "the experiment failed", "nobody cares anymore", "I give up, sold my coins, I'm out". Like they are now.
I think the best sell signal is when people are talking about altcoins, because they missed the bitcoin train.  Edit: now that it's possible to short bitcoin, this may not be a good signal anymore.  Another signal is when completely nontechnical people in your life suddenly ask you if they should buy it.

This is why I feel bitcoin has been poorly designed.
Miners put events in chronological order, that is their only function. But what has been built is "miners put Bitcoin transactions in order" and then we're trying to engineer everything else on top of that.
Instead there should be a generic "putting things in order" layer upon which bitcoin and everything else is built.
I know, without bitcoin from the start, how could we compensate miners? Well, bitcoin could have been just the first application on top of that layer. But there was never any such layer, it was all bound together, and it still is.
Miners should just be paid to apply proof of work to a merkle tree root - choose a miner however you want, pay them however you want. In the specific instance of bitcoin, miners listen to the bitcoin network for offers and they're paid by that network when they find a block with sufficient difficulty. But that shouldn't be the only way to pay miners. You should be able to pay them to apply PoW to **anything**, and pay with cash or credit cards or a micropayment channel or whatever the miner accepts.
As Paul says, there's no cost to include any extra content in whatever is being mined.
@_date: 2016-03-01 19:16:56
Nobody credible has ever said there's an "impending disaster".
It's just an artificially capped supply of transaction space, so demand will also be capped. In other words, transaction fees will rise as high as they have to rise, in order for demand for block space to equal 1mb every 10 minutes.
Some say that capping supply in this manner is a bad idea, because potential users who show up hoping to use bitcoin will be turned away and forced to use something else. It's certainly not ideal to jack up the price on customers who are probably barely interested to begin with. However breaking the security properties of bitcoin that got it this far, is potentially worse.
Developers argue that there isn't much room left to provide more supply without breaking things. I'm in no position to disprove that claim. However, there's still nothing stopping people from using alternatives.
I think the devs are correctly positioning bitcoin as the most censorship resistant option. Some people don't need that. Today I think there's a big market for "somewhat censorship resistant and cheap", but the niche is mostly unserved. Something will come along to serve that market. It shouldn't be bitcoin though, it can't do both.

You mean just like any physical key looks as worthless as any other? The difference with the 256 random bits isn't the **key**. It's the **lock**. It's a very high quality lock. With most of our keys, we don't really give a shit if we lose them. I mean, we do, because it's inconvenient. But it's not disastrous. If we lose the key to our house, we just have a lock guy come open it and replace the lock. Or if we lose the key to our car, we have the manufacturer give us a new one.
If you lose your bitcoin key, there's no one to call. There are no tricks to defeat the lock, no way to replace the lock with a new one.
*This* is why the bitcoin key has to be treated specially. Not because of the value of what it's protecting, but because the lock that it fits is impossible to open any other way.

I think you and I are saying the same thing. When I say "miners will mine whatever they're paid to mine", I don't mean they have to mine a particular chain. They'll just mine whichever one is most profitable.
Here's an example. Which chain would you mine: one where coins sell for $100 and difficulty is 1 million, or one where coins sell for $50 and difficulty is 100,000?  Clearly the latter. Miners really don't care about whether the latter coin is going to be useful in the future. They only care that someone is paying for it NOW, and they care that **some coin** that their equipment can mine will be useful long enough to reach ROI on that equipment.

Yes. A POW change will temporarily block a 51% attack, and make the funds spent on the attack up to that point wasted. However the attacker can mount another attack if it has nearly unlimited funds.
If you're talking about a state-funded actor who is determined to disrupt bitcoin, there are really only two defenses: to become so small as to not be worth attacking anymore, or to become so large as to make a 51% attack prohibitively expensive, even for a nation-state.

Miners do not set the rules of bitcoin. Miners follow them.
You're being bamboozled. This FUD is trying to convince you that miners tell YOU what rules to follow, when it's the exact opposite - you tell miners.
Miners are converting electricity into a product that they are selling on the market. If ~~you don't want~~ no one wants to buy that product, they have no business. Don't buy things that you don't want. That means, if you don't want 1mb block bitcoins, don't buy them. Buy Classic or BIP101 or whatever it is you actually want (as soon as it's available).

The thing that bothers me about his post is that he's either lying or never really understood bitcoin (the concept) in the first place.
It's a *voluntary* currency. Nobody can force you to use rules you don't want. The flip side is you can't force other people either, so if nobody agrees with you then you'll have a not-very-useful currency. In this case, there are plenty of people on both sides of the block size debate, so there's a large amount of agreement.
The only reason for large-blockers to continue to debate is if they believe the smaller network size is unacceptable. This is self-defeating. If they really believe the network will shrink, then they don't even need large blocks.
Then there's the mining FUD. "If we fork and keep using double SHA-256, then if we don't have the majority of the world's mining power, we'll be attacked!"
Do you really think bitcoin miners would waste resources attacking litecoin if their hardware was capable of it? No. They have no motive to attack litecoin, and they'll have no motive to attack a large-block fork. If they are so worried about large blocks winning, they would be much better off mining it honestly. This economic motive is what made bitcoin work in the first place. If it wasn't true, bitcoin could not survive.
The fact that Mike Hearn either doesn't know this, or is willfully ignoring it to be dramatic, is rather disappointing.
Edit: one little issue I left out. The fork *must* make a protocol change that makes miners choose whether they're mining honestly or attacking. Without a protocol change, small block miners can attack the large block fork, with zero cost. Blocks on the small block chain *must* be invalid on the large block network. This change could be as simple as swapping the locations of two fields in the protocol.

The whole point of difficulty adjustment is to keep mining difficult enough so that most miners do not have significant profit.
Granted, we are not always at that equilibrium.  But for the most part, miners always sell their almost all their bitcoin.  They have to, to pay their costs.

My point was that bitcoin cannot serve as a backing commodity, it defeats the entire purpose. (Edited) issuing currency backed by bitcoin adds a trusted third party. If TTPs are what people want, they already have it.
There are 3 primary reasons people don't transact in gold today:
1) It's hard to secure
2) It's not very divisible
3) They are threatened with violence (mostly from governments) if they do use it.
1 &amp;2 do not apply to bitcoin. 3 is a completely separate argument. I am only saying that "people must transact in bitcoin itself" assuming that they are willing to do so. If they're not, then they cannot enjoy any of its benefits. It seems like maybe you do not agree with that statement, that it's possible to not use bitcoin and still somehow enjoy its benefits. If 99.9% of the population don't use bitcoin at all, what's stopping the government (or anyone else) from stealing from them via inflation, confiscation, etc?

Sure, I agree that more software needs to be built to make the blockchain easier to use (and thus more invisible to the end user).
However it's not going to be google or netflix who will build those services.
Youtube and Netflix are rent-seeking services. There's no technical reason why video content can't be delivered directly from producers to consumers. It's just someone would have to write that rather complex software, and no one has. So google and Netflix write it as a centralized service, and charge rent.
It's going to take a large cultural shift, but copyright enforcement is eventually going to crumble. Once digital intellectual property is released into the world, the ability to profit off it is over (making copies is free, supply goes to infinity, price goes to zero). The only reason this hasn't happened already is threats of force that aren't very effective on the internet. The only viable business model in the future will be crowdfunding. People will pay up front for the digital content to be produced, and once it's done, the producers are paid and then release the content. Movies, TV shows, books, and software will be produced this way.

It wouldn't have any effect on PoW change. It doesn't matter who's attacking, and it's impossible to hide that an attack is taking place.

You think miners are bitcoin investors, but they are not. They are bitcoin producers. They may also invest, by holding on to what they mine, but they don't have to. Even then, they are speculating on what users (not including themselves) are going to demand in the future. They are indeed slaves to the users, just as any company will die without customers.

Except they don't, at all. Miners follow consensus rules, they don't make them. 
Full nodes decide what is valid, miners just try to please the economic majority of full nodes. If a miner says a transaction is invalid but a full node says it's valid, the miner loses (the transaction is included later by another miner). If the miner says the transaction is valid, but full node says invalid, the miner loses again. The full node ignores that miner's block and everything built upon it.

The price movement of individual buys is totally irrelevant. If the order book has 100 sellers all selling 50 btc at $200, then Willy could buy 5000 bitcoin without moving the price AT ALL. The topology of the order book graph doesn't matter, what matters is that Willy took a huge supply off the market - over 2% of all the coins in existence, and a far larger proportion of all the coins on the market.

An altcoin has a completely separate transaction history. That's not what we're talking about. A fork is a fork whether it has the highest market cap or not.
And it doesn't have to "displace" bitcoin at all, and certainly not on the first day of its existence. It just has to coexist, presumably by occupying a different niche (high capacity vs anonymous mining).
@_date: 2017-03-07 23:27:22
This brings up a good question, what is the market value of an on-chain bitcoin transaction?
Of course, you can't just come up with an exact number, it depends on lots of things, which are changing over time. For example, the demand for secure, censorship-resistant transactions, the cost and properties of alternatives, available supply of block space, etc.
However we clearly have not even begun to approach equilibrium. $10 does not seem unreasonable, given enough new users who wish to use bitcoin to move relatively large amounts.
Anyone holding a certain amount of coins as an investment, cannot be priced out of the fee market. I'd say that threshold is somewhere in the tens to hundreds of coins. The reason for this is as follows: if the fees are astronomical, and 300,000 txs per day are still paying that fee, then presumably the fee is still small compared to the value being transacted. So the value being transacted is even more astronomical. With the limited supply, the price would have to follow. So the fees denominated in bitcoin would have to level off. edit: in other words, I would expect that fees denominated in bitcoin cannot exceed 1 bitcoin, and likely the limit is quite a bit less than that.
@_date: 2015-01-13 19:29:59
You miss bitcoin's point completely.
Bitcoin isn't for buying pillows at Overstock, or games from Microsoft. Anyone who does that is wasting their time and money.
Bitcoin is for DISOBEYING AUTHORITY. It doesn't matter who the authority is, it could be the government who forbids you to remove money from the country, forbids you from buying certain things from certain entities. It could be your bank who commands you to tell them who you transact with and what your source of income is.  It could be Western Union or Visa, with their regulatory capture, charging monopolistic high fees.
Here you are talking about how bitcoin sucks for buying everyday items (which no one is trying to stop you from doing in the first place - just the opposite, they're encouraging you to buy unnecessary crap).
That's not what you're supposed to do with it!  Buy weed, run an unlicensed business, send money to relatives overseas. Or invest in broadening those activities, by holding bitcoin.﻿

Oh, well that's much better then. /s
And by the way, "no" block reward in this case doesn't mean zero satoshis, it means insignificant compared to fees. That means possibly 10-20 years from now.
The problem is that when fees outweigh the block reward, and there's no block size limit, a miner is better off trying to orphan the current block, rather than building on top of it. That way, he steals all the fees in the current block, plus fees from whatever transactions have occurred since then. So basically you don't get new blocks, you get one block that keeps getting replaced with bigger ones.

The specific reason Litecoin was created is irrelevant, as long as there was a perception that it offered something that bitcoin didn't.

That's just the way it works. The alternative of forcing people to agree to something they don't actually want, will fail. The nature of bitcoin (the concept) is to route around exactly this kind of censorship. Yes, that means major upheaval is coming, mainstream confidence in bitcoin will drop for some time, etc etc. So what? Bitcoin grew too fast. The sooner we admit that, the better. There's nothing else we can do. On the upside, it's likely that the value of bitcoin will drop during the upheaval, and then rise again after it's settled. So it'll be a great buying opportunity.
Personally I don't want small blocks. That's not the bitcoin I signed up for. I totally understand why some people want small blocks, and I'm happy for them to have it, but it's not for me. As soon as there is a large block fork, I will switch to it and probably sell at least some of my small-block coins. I don't care if the value of the large block fork unit is a fraction of a cent. I don't care if small-block miners attack the fork several times and it has to be re-forked. Me and everyone else who wants large blocks, will get it eventually. I simply cannot understand why anyone in the community wants to stand in the way of it. It can't be blocked, that's the nature of bitcoin.

I'm sorry but what you're proposing makes no sense to me.
You cannot have it both ways, either Amazon controls the supply of the coin or they don't.  If they don't, then they don't control the price at all (because they control neither the supply nor the demand).  So there is absolutely nothing they could do to cause 'stable and predictable slow rise'.  They can't really encourage demand without taking a loss on their own sales.
So something has to give.  Either they do a massive premine and control the supply, (in which case nobody wants to pay $5 to Amazon for something they just made up out of thin air and have a virtually unlimited supply of).  Or they hemorrhage value by selling coins for $5 but buy them for $6 worth of goods.

Which is it? If it's ok to buy the ETF, it's not that different to buy on coinbase and leave your coins there. I would not recommend that, but I wouldn't recommend the ETF either unless you're ok with the risks (IIUC they are not insured against hacking and theft).
If you knew how hard it was to buy and store bitcoin in 2011, you'd think it's a breeze today. Buying on coinbase is a piece of cake, actually it's been like that since they opened in 2013. Hardware wallets appeared shortly after, it's really hard to make a mistake with those, they're nearly hack proof, and not costly if you're storing a significant amount.
Here's how I bought my first coins:
1) Register with dwolla. Wait for bank info to be confirmed, 1 week
2) Create mtgox account, upload KYC info. Wait for approval, 1 week (edit - could be done concurrently with dwolla registration)
3) Wire money from bank to dwolla. 4 days
4) Wire money from dwolla to mtgox. 1 week
5) Buy bitcoin on mtgox
6) Figure out how to safely create and backup a wallet (I used the original bitcoin-qt at the time and later moved to blockchain.info, and then to the trezor).
7) Withdraw bitcoin to wallet
However, I can tell you that because I went to all this trouble when everyone else looked at that process and said "fuck that noise", I was rewarded handsomely. There just werent that many buyers when it was that difficult to buy. But it kept getting easier, and the price kept rising. The same is true today, the people willing to jump through all the hoops to get bitcoin, will get it cheapest. By the time everyone can buy it with pre-tax money in an ETF with a few clicks, the price will be higher.
Edit: just looking at the correlation between ease-of-purchase and ease-of-use and the price, I suspect the ETF approval would take the price to entirely new levels. Maybe not on day 1, but within a year.

Yes, I agree. So basically either Jihan is bluffing, or he is only interested in killing the core chain no matter how much money it costs him.
I don't know anything about him, so i can't really say which one it is, but if I had to bet, it'd be the former.
I don't see why he would give up money just for some nebulous ideal. And I don't think the Chinese government has gotten to him, either. If the Chinese government wanted to attack bitcoin, I don't see why they would bother trying to hide that they were behind it, it'd be obvious eventually. They might as well just say "yep, we're attacking bitcoin". It's not like they need anyone's permission.

It is perhaps possible you were phished, if you visited their site via a link vs typing in their hostname in the address bar.
It is unlikely though, since you would have had to do it twice (the first time, the malicious site captures your login, pw, and 2fa, using that to log in to the real site, but they cannot withdraw without another 2fa code. Then they wait for you to do another login at the phishing site, this time capturing the 2fa on your login that they use for withdrawal). That would be assuming their session didn't time out between the two logins you did. Again this seems like an unlikely attack vector, but if you did visit the site via a link, might be worth looking into.
Other than that, I don't see how this could have been a remote hacking of your accounts from outside Nitrogen. It was either an insider at Nitrogen or someone you know who had physical access to your phone.
The cloudflare thing is very unlikely since it supposedly affected so few requests, the odds they could have captured your 2fa secret at the time you enabled 2FA is basically nil.

I thought the fork threat was going to be a problem back when bitcoin was at $200. Glad I didn't sell then. 
Forks are going to have to be dealt with sometime. They can't be prevented. Marketing BS is going to peel away some users and push them onto a less secure alternative that may or may not collapse later. I think at some point the chaos will come, and it will be a great buying opportunity for the highest-security fork (which right now is clearly the chain that bitcoin core points at, and also for the foreseeable future). 
The question is, when should I set some fiat aside for that buying opportunity? Clearly late 2015 was wrong, even though it seemed like a good time to me then. Is now a good time? I have no idea.

I grant you that determining the economic majority is difficult given the private nature of bitcoin. However the burden of proof is on BU supporters. Reddit comments are easily manufactured. 
So far, in favor of segwit we have major exchanges (who do control large amounts of bitcoin and generate lots of txs, even though they don't legally own the bitcoin). In favor of BU we have Roger Ver. Any other major holders you know of?

What you're talking about here isn't Lightning, it's a private ledger agreed to by various exchanges. The people you're describing will not have any real LN channels at all, they'll just have exchange accounts.
All this could be done today without LN, all it requires is an agreement between coinbase and bitstamp, which would allow users of one exchange to send to users of the other, without ever hitting the blockchain (until the two exchanges decide to settle up, which they'd probably do periodically).
I see no problem with this whatsoever. For people who want to trust exchanges, it's a reasonable solution - instant, nearly free, and no software to install. Of course there is always a tradeoff, and in this case it's counterparty risk. The exchange could become insolvent and the users would never be able to withdraw. I see no reason not to offer this choice for people who just want to invest in bitcoin and make payments with the proceeds, without having to bother with all the technical details of risk avoidance and censorship resistance.
However for people who do care about counterparty risk and censorship resistance, real LN channels will be required.

First of all you don't have to match the rest of the network. Gavin's proposal says that the attacker's fork has to have "much lower" priority to become invalid. Let's say 1/10th.
So you have to have 1/10th of the btc days destroyed. 2 weeks worth of legitimate traffic looks like about 3 million BDD.
You'd need 300,000 BDD. If you were willing to wait 6 months to attack, you'd need 1600 btc, or $380,000. That's nothing compared to the cost of mounting the attack in the first place. Obviously having to wait less time would cost more, and sustaining the attack longer would cost more. But I think this shows it's totally realistic.

This is not the first time, although maybe the most intense. I have to admit I was getting pretty uncomfortable. The last time was after the Hearn ragequit. It's always FUD. Always. You should be buying instead, as incredibly difficult as that is to do.
I've always thought that it's inevitable that bitcoin cannot easily capture the mainstream market. Alts that come up with a nice-sounding story that nontechnical people can't see through, will become popular until it becomes clear that they can't really deliver (which may take years). We can't worry about this, it's going to happen. Ethereum and BU are examples of this.

Most of what you're describing is not a problem that blockchains solve. It's just digital sigs and other software.
The only problem that I think blockchains might apply to, is a district election commission just ignoring valid votes, pretending it never received them. An open blockchain would provide censorship resistance, assuming the miners had incentive to mine and were of sufficient diversity. I don't know how that would work in an election blockchain. Perhaps you could describe it or link to a description.
Not that it matters, but I have a CS degree.

What's more damaging:
* The inflation gets slightly ahead of schedule
* Transaction capacity is severely reduced for weeks or months

This is a problem with the difficulty retargeting mechanism of namecoin. It causes hysteresis by not considering any past history before the last retarget.
It would be a problem for bitcoin too if bitcoin didn't have the largest hashrate. It just hasn't been fixed for bitcoin because it isn't a problem for bitcoin.

For me at least, it took a long time for me to give up on the idea that there's a magic solution that would give us everything we want. It's very tempting to want to increase the block size because a) you can't see exactly how it would fail because it's very technical and complex and b) if you hold bitcoin, you want others to want to hold it too, and rising fees are a barrier to that. The "simplest" way to avoid that barrier is just raise the block size, but then you end up with a sort of pyramid scheme: new adopters want to bring in more new adopters by raising the block size again, and obviously it has to fall apart before everyone has adopted bitcoin. I see no point anymore in even starting off down that road.

My point was that there's nothing about bitcoin that prevents this from working in an easy to use way.
It does require more software to be written, and that probably won't happen for a while. But it's not like "bitcoin can't do recurring payments".

A lot of this angst comes from misusage of terminology. 
"Hardfork" - what this *should* mean is a split in the consensus (and transaction histories). What people actually use it to mean is actually a "hardturn" - a bend in the road instead of a fork, where everyone goes the same way. 
"bitcoin" - this can mean a million different things. The network, the software, the ledger, the concept. 
You should know this, but bitcoin (the concept) is a voluntary currency. You join up with people who **want** to follow the same rules. Nobody can force you to "hardturn". Maybe 99% of the people go a different way from you, and you're left with a less useful currency. Oh well, that's up to you to decide whether keeping your rules is worth having a smaller network. Bitcoin was once 1% of its current size and people still found it useful.
I don't understand why anyone thinks that a large-block network and a small-block network can't coexist just like bitcoin and litecoin have co-existed for years. If they occupy different functional niches then there's no reason they won't coexist forever. 
I personally think the small/large block networks **do** in fact occupy different niches on the 'useful &lt;-&gt; censorship resistant' continuum.

You have got to be kidding. That was not what attracted people to bitcoin. Were your Visa purchases not going through fast enough at 5 seconds? Were you paying more for Visa than when using cash? Nope and nope.
If you were expecting bitcoin to solve your speed and transaction cost issues, you were looking in the wrong place. That is not what bitcoin does.
Bitcoin lets you send money when powerful adversaries are trying to prevent you from doing so. Bitcoin does not allow (edit: arbitrary) inflation despite powerful adversaries attempting to do so.
What bitcoin is not, and never was, is fast and cheap. No, bitcoin was never cheap. The costs were just hidden in inflation. Now that the block reward has halved twice, it's not so hidden anymore.

"If blockstream would allow"?
Anyone can write software and deploy it, there's nothing blockstream could do to stop it. If it were so easy to solve the scaling issues, it would have been done already and we'd be using it. 
The fact that we haven't reached consensus is perfectly fine. What that means is that we'd rather stick together with a solution that is not optimal for us, than try to go our separate ways. It makes sense, a single network is more valuable than a fragmented one. The extra value overrides any minor debate. The fact that we haven't split means the scaling issue isn't important enough to split over. Bitcoin is doing ok the way it is.
@_date: 2016-01-18 23:42:08
They are bluffing.
Is that not obvious to everyone? There are clearly enough users to make viable separate networks (one with small blocks, one with large). If bitcoin and litecoin can coexist, so can core and classic (or core and xt, or whatever).
The only way one side could "win" is if the other side capitulates. There's absolutely no reason to think that will happen. Who would argue about this for literally years and then just give up? 
This will end in a fork. A real fork, not this "contentious hard fork" bs that isn't even a fork at all. Nobody gives a damn if the half of the users leave the network. Most of the people participating in this discussion were *there* when the network was much less than half its current size.

Stop being pedantic. "Moore's Law" is just shorthand for "exponentially increasing speeds". Yeah it's not proper, but everyone knows what we mean by this.

Look, it's an online system. If you're not online, you're not part of the network, simple as that. Besides, half the world's population wouldn't run a full node even if they had fiber. 
The idea here is to balance the disincentives. "Can't afford transactions" and "Can't afford validating hardware" are two reasons to not run a full node, at the two ends of the spectrum. Where we want to be is right in between those two ends. I can guarantee you, half the world population will be excluded today, NO MATTER WHAT.

One thing he's right about, bitcoin *is* forking.
* Are there enough users willing to support a large-block fork? Yes
* Are there miners willing to mine it? Yes
* Are there enough programmers with the knowledge to code and release the fork? Yes
* Is the fork sufficiently different that it will occupy its own economic niche? Yes
There is nothing standing in the way except lame attempts at obfuscation and censorship. This is at best a delay tactic. As far as I'm concerned it's a foregone conclusion, eventually there will be both small-block and large-block ledger.

This is what seems to be glossed over in all these discussions.
The "garden" scenario is exactly what you'll get with a voluntary ecosystem, and that is what bitcoin is. Roughly what determines how much diverging will happen is this: weigh the value of a larger network against the value of (what you perceive as) better rules. If the rules are more valuable, a fork is unstoppable. Given Metcalfe's law, the value of network size is hard to overcome, but it's definitely possible.
@_date: 2017-03-29 19:12:49

Yes, the fact that everyone has their price is what nearly everyone overlooks. "Bitcoin isn't fair because in 2010 people were buying 10,000 btc for a few dollars, and now they're zillionaires". That's inaccurate because they don't still have those 10,000 btc, they never became zillionaires. They sold them at $5 or $25 or whatever price made such a large change in their lifestyle, that the risks of losing it became intolerable. 
The same thing will keep happening. The coder who makes $70k a year, who bought 1000 btc at $10, is probably not holding out for $10,000. The million dollars he has today is a lot of money to him, he's either sold already or getting close to his price.
@_date: 2017-03-28 17:10:43
The fact that bitcoin is that hard to understand, quite frankly is a problem.
The argument that "nobody needs to understand bitcoin to use it, just like tcp/ip" doesn't work. You can't use bitcoin in the long term without understanding it, and BU is proof. You'll end up being shunted onto a knock-off product that doesn't actually work, and you don't find out until it's too late. You can't simply trust the brand name "bitcoin" either, because that can be co-opted.
This is why I think bitcoin is destined to be a niche product, and supports the small block case even more.

I haven't really done my homework on checkpointing, but it seems highly suspect to me. You might as well just use proof of stake and stop wasting all that electricity at that point. PoW gives you trustless bootstrapping - allows you to determine the correct UTXO on your own (as long as there's at least one reachable honest node that doesn't hide chains from you). If you use a checkpoint, you're trusting someone else. And no, you're not already trusting core devs anyway. You can read the source and build the software yourself. You currently do not have to trust anyone. If you use checkpoints, that trustless environment is gone.


Well of course it doesn't. You could break security of your own client in countless ways that don't affect other nodes.

I must be missing something, why would it assume this? This algorithm seems to be assuming two mutually exclusive things: 1) The next block fee threshold will be like the last block (because it sees this high-fee tx didn't make it into the last block, and assumes that same fee won't make the next block either). 2) The next block fee threshold will NOT be like the last block (because the fee estimator apparently is looking at the mempool and not the threshold from the last block).

Referring to miners "collectively" is a mistake, IMO.
Bitcoin doesn't work unless the miners are composed of many independent economic actors. There is no "collective". If there were, then there is really only one miner and bitcoin is broken because the one miner can censor the entire network.
The only thing all miners should have in common is that they are trying to maximize their own profit. This is why a situation where "all miners decide not to include it", is basically the same as a 51% attack. At that point, the whole network has broken down and lost its important properties. Miners have already decided NOT to maximize their profit.

If bitcoin is not censorship resistant, it is worthless. Since it has value today, people believe it is censorship resistant. If the government bans it and no one is able to use it, then it is not censorship resistant and therefore its valuation was inaccurate.
Since it hasn't been banned yet, we can't know what will happen if/when it is. Its current value includes speculation on that outcome.

That was not my point at all. classic would absolutely be the smaller one at first. Who knows which one would hold the majority after some time in competition. That's what we need to find out.


This story doesn't even make sense. What do you mean by "block cycle"? Difficulty only adjusts every couple of weeks, you can't drive difficulty up in a few minutes. If you mean "difficulty reset period", then why would miners jump out of namecoin? Because all the other miners had jumped in? It doesn't make sense for them all to leave, because then it would be profitable to jump back in immediately.

AFAIK, it hasn't solved scalability, the proofs are "short", but transactions aren't smaller than bitcoin transactions.


The only way to prove that "no transaction illegally inflated the money supply" is to validate all the transactions. If your node doesn't do that, it may not detect inflation. Someone else might, of course, but it's not the same security guarantee.


It really depends on whether the layer above also prevents inflation. LN does, but it involves (temporarily) locking up bitcoin so that you can't spend it freely anymore.

BU obscured the source, creating a temporary safe bubble, because attackers will take a bit of time to reverse engineer (pierce the bubble). After that though, BU is totally vulnerable (the bubble boy has no immune system).

The miners are bluffing, and I want to call them on it. By threatening to HF to BU they're basically burning down their own business. They can go right ahead as far as I'm concerned. Let there be chaos. Eventually it will pass. Then the next time miners get this idea in their heads that they can set the rules, they will think twice.
By caving to their demands, we only set a dangerous precedent. BU support among actual bitcoin holders is a very small minority. I'd be more than happy to get rid of them.

Bitcoin keeps track of a history of transactions. Normally it's just a straight line of A-&gt;B-&gt;C, everyone agrees there is just one line of history because everyone is using the same rules to choose the "best" history.
But what if some of the people decide to use different rules? Then they might decide A-&gt;B-&gt;D is "best" for them. Some of the history is the same, but the end is different. So anyone that received coins in A will have coins in A-&gt;B-&gt;C **and** also in A-&gt;B-&gt;D. 
Ideally your coins from 2013 would be perfectly safe, even though you have coins on both forks. You could just wait, and maybe one of the forks will die. The people who thought they wanted a rule change, change their minds and D just disappears, and A-&gt;B-&gt;C wins. Or maybe the two forks will coexist forever. 
What if you prefer one set of rules and you don't want to own coins in the other ruleset? You can sell one side and buy the other (assuming an exchange supports both). This is where a technical issue could bite you - replay attack. If you sign a transaction sending coins to Bitstamp on the A-&gt;B-&gt;D fork so you can sell them, someone could broadcast that same transaction on A-&gt;B-&gt;C, since it would be valid in either. So while you intended to only send your A-&gt;B-&gt;D coins to Bitstamp, your A-&gt;B-&gt;C coins might end up there too. There are ways to avoid this but I won't get into that here.

This could be automated by wallet software. No such feature exists yet that I know of.
Imagine you sign up for netflix monthly service. You scan a QR that contains the payment interval (monthly), amount (0.02 btc) and the xpub key for netflix where your payments go. Your mobile wallet asks you: "Do you want to be notified of outgoing payments for this subscription?" If you select yes, then the day before each payment, you get a notification "Payment scheduled for tomorrow: Netflix, 0.02 BTC. Click to cancel payment". 
Worst case, you leave your phone off for a long time and your subscription is suspended until you turn it back on or make a payment from another wallet.

No. Miners follow the rules, they do not set them. (edit: if miners don't like the rules, they are welcome to go mine some other chain that they feel is more profitable. They are in no position to demand rule changes, even though some of them apparently think that they are)
If an olive branch needs to be extended to anyone, it's the holders of bitcoin. However I see no evidence that the economic majority is rejecting segwit in favor of a hardfork. All evidence points to the economic majority supporting segwit and some miners trying to block it.

I think there is probably some legitimate disillusionment by people who never understood what bitcoin was for.
They came hoping for fast and cheap transactions, but that was never really what bitcoin did. Bitcoin always cost money, but no one really noticed because transaction fees were subsidized by inflation. So you could send a zero-fee transaction and you paid for it by your stash losing value with the creation of new coins. Again no one really noticed because new user adoption offset the inflation (and then some).
But you need not worry. If 300,000 people a day are outbidding you for block space, that means bitcoin is worth a lot to a lot of people. More than it's worth to you! This is not a bad thing. It's a good thing.

It's a tradeoff. For bitcoin, there are risks with making changes, and there are risks with not making changes.
However, consider how frictionless it is to exchange one cryptocurrency for another. In my view, bitcoin must take some risks by making changes, or it will definitely be defeated by a currency that takes risks that end up paying off.
Bitcoin doesn't have to take as many risks as competing cryptocurrencies, because it has network effect advantages. But that doesn't mean it can avoid risk altogether.

It makes no sense whatsoever. The only reason to bother with LN is precisely because on-chain txs are too expensive. There is no scenario where everyone uses LN and there's no demand for on-chain txs. The balance will be struck at whatever fee is high enough that you'd rather lock your funds in a channel than pay the fee. I'm guessing those fees are still going to be higher than current fees. Still, most of the parties using LN will be those that make very frequent, low-value txs. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 13:02:27


Well, a LN channel that you trust the other party to monitor isn't going to work. They can just rollback to previous states without you knowing it, right? That's not really much better than a custodial account like exchanges give you today. I doubt it will ever work like you describe, where an exchange user has a LN channel open with an exchange but doesn't monitor it. It'll have to go one way or the other. 
I don't see what's so onerous about monitoring a LN channel, a mobile phone could do a decent job of it with the right software (at least good enough to keep exchanges honest).
@_date: 2017-03-07 15:23:22
I don't understand the issue. The customer has a channel with coinbase, and so does the coffee shop. So the network routes it and the customer pays for his coffee.
I suspect you may be assuming that a LN-enabled wallet won't run on the user's mobile phone and handle everything in the background. I don't know of any reason that wouldn't eventually be the way it works.
If a user can't run a LN-aware wallet, then the whole network is nearly useless as a consumer product.

There is nothing the miners can do. They will either follow the rules or leave.
I think it's rather sad that all this effort was put into removing power from a cabal of central bankers, only for people to desperately cry for a ruling class to tell them what to do. If we start negotiating with miners now, why would they ever stop making demands? Why wouldn't they demand the block reward be hardforked back to 50? There absolutely must be a threat of firing the miners, at all times. If that threat is removed, we've handed miners full control of the network, and bitcoin becomes worthless.

The average person could not give less of a shit about bitcoin or censorship resistance or distrusting third parties. The average person does what third parties tell them to do, and they've been conditioned their entire lives to behave this way. 
I'm not going to base any of my choices of what bitcoin rules I run, on the assumption that there's hordes of people wanting to get in.

Maybe I misunderstand what you're saying here, but it sounds it follows directly from the definition of a fork. "As soon as you take the path to the left, you are no longer with all the people who took the path to the right".




I think what you're saying here is, "if the chains have different genesis blocks, that's an alt, what if they have 1 block in common but diverge after that, is that still a fork and not an alt"?
Technically you're right that it's not totally black and white unless you define an alt as "having no history in common at all". For the purposes of this discussion, I think that definition works fine. If the fork is motivated by a rule disagreement, you either don't roll back any history (fork "now"), or you roll it all back (start over). In fact, I would think realistically forks have to be announced in advance - the updated software has to roll out to users before the fork happens.

No, that's exactly what I'm saying is a losing strategy.
If you believe y will appreciate in value against x, you should mine y, and take profits as it appreciates. If you think x will appreciate against y, you should keep mining x. (edit: i know difficulty factors into this too - but it balances - if y has sky-high difficulty making it less profitable to mine, it's also more expensive to attack)
There is no scenario where the winning strategy is to attack anything. All of those hashes end up being wasted.
There's never going to be a monopoly scenario where there's only one miner and he can set prices at whatever he wants. It renders the entire blockchain worthless, as the whole point of it is to eliminate trusted third parties. If there's only one miner, he's the trusted third party. He might as well turn off his miners and run a central database at that point.

That was never going to happen anyway. At one end of the spectrum (small blocks) a billion people can run a node, but they have no reason to do so (there isn't enough block space for them all to receive even 1 tx per year). At the other end of the spectrum (huge blocks), lots of people want to run a full node (because they receive lots of txs) but they cannot because the hardware is too expensive.
The ideal spot is right in the middle. $10k per node is probably in the right range, maybe a bit low. Keep in mind that SPV security actually is pretty good, especially compared to anything that's not bitcoin.

Bitcoins were being bought constantly with dollars that it turned out later, didn't exist. Sure, there were real users paying $1200 a coin, but that's only because they thought someone else with real money was going to keep buying no matter where the price went. The bubble was nothing but fraud, and you might as well wipe it off the price graph, if you want to see a more accurate picture of supply and demand.

You're right, it's inconsistent to say it's OK for ETH to be governed by devs but bash bitcoin for it.
But I don't think many individual people hold both those opinions.
Here's my take: we should not care what miners think about rule changes. Their job is to resolve conflicts between mutually incompatible changes to a database. In a currency we call it preventing doublespends. That's it. They can either do the job or GTFO. They are not hired to give their opinion on the rules of the system. 
The fact that we pay them with the very currency they're helping to secure, does not change anything. They still don't get to decide the rules, they can either participate or leave.
Let's say you hire someone to paint your house blue for $5000. And they say "you know what, I think I'm going to paint it red. That'll be $5000 please". You'd tell them to fuck off and find someone who will do the job you're hiring for. If they said "Sure i'll paint it blue, but I need $6000", then maybe you would negotiate. The price is negotiable, the actual job is not negotiable. 
edit: what's happening now in the bitcoin community is that the owners are mistakenly thinking they might have no choice but to paint the house red! There is no reason to think this.

It doesn't exist, sorry. You either have to be willing to use other forms of payment besides debit card, or you have to provide lots of personal info.
If you decide to just provide the info, I'd suggest Gemini. If you decide you can pay with something other than debit card, try localbitcoins. I know people there trade prepaid debit cards for bitcoin (at a premium of course), but I suspect that's not what you want.

When fees are $10 or $100 then maybe we have a problem. Fees are still currently very cheap considering what you get. Bitcoin's not free anymore, that was never going to last. I personally don't care whether fees are 50 cents or 25 cents, so doubling the block size makes little difference.

No, localbitcoin doesn't have a market price because it does not do order matching. The users do it manually.
If you place a limit order on an exchange that does order matching, to sell bitcoin for $1 each, it won't actually sell for $1 each, it'll turn into a market sell and give you the current best price of ~1250.  The only way to force the market price down to $1 is to sell so many bitcoins that you take every buy offer in their order book, all the way down to $1.

You're talking about what the community calls "hard fork" which isn't a fork at all.

The "proof of work" that bitcoin uses has some data that can be analyzed. The early miners left clues in those proofs - numbers that incremented cleanly from one block to a near-future block, that suggests they were mined by the same person. While it's clear there were large groupings of these, it's hard to say how many people did it. To say there were "few" seems safe.

You can't simultaneously believe that Jihan is interested in profit AND that he'll sustain an attack against the other chain. He'll lose money by attacking and make money by mining honestly. That's precisely the incentives that make bitcoin work in the first place.
And no, it's not a rational profit incentive to attack the other fork to kill it, and then resume mining yours honestly. As a miner, if you believe the other fork will overtake yours in value, you should rationally switch to mining it honestly immediately. On the other hand, if you believe the other fork is not a threat, there is no point in wasting money attacking it, you should mine your own chain honestly.

No one gives a flying fuck what miners want. They are offered a job at a certain rate and they can take it or leave it.
Now, if holders of bitcoin want larger blocks, that's a different story. They're the ones with the money (the ones who give value to what miners are mining, hence essentially the ones paying them).

You can buy slightly more bitcoin than you intend to spend and just leave the remainder on localbitcoin, or withdraw it to your phone.

You know why it's hard to buy, right? Bitcoin transactions are secure and irreversible. Whatever method you use to pay for bitcoin is NOT irreversible. So whoever sells you bitcoin has to be REALLY careful to ensure you don't reverse your payment, because they cannot get the bitcoin back from you. That is why coinbase is limiting you to $5. They have reason to think you are a reversal risk. Don't ask me why they think that, you might come up with some theories.

There'll be room for a few people per second to exit. I think that's probably still sufficient. If not, only people selling small amounts will be blocked (since the fee will be too large compared to the proceeds from their sale).
I don't think this is equivalent to a bank run anyway. In a bank run, whoever is last doesn't get their money at all. In a bitcoin run, they'll still own the bitcoin, they just will face delays in moving it.

I think it's naive to believe that bitcoin can add features and keep up with competitors *without* forking. The block size issue has been talked to death for 3 years with no resolution, the *only* way to resolve it is by forking. That's going to be the case with any number of new features that come up down the road.
We shouldn't think of bitcoin forks as a bad thing, we just have to admit to ourselves that it isn't mature. It's nowhere near finished - it works fine now, but it will not keep working indefinitely without major changes.
It's off-putting to merchants to have to deal with this headache. But it's off-putting to deal with chargebacks. Nothing is perfect. If most of them sit on the sidelines while it matures I wouldn't blame them.
@_date: 2017-03-29 20:45:24
Of course, if all bitcoin users are idiots and will just blindly follow whatever rules miners tell them to follow, then it's not a given.
Miners could say, "we've decided to change bitcoin's inflation schedule such that it keeps a 10% inflation rate forever - we love our block rewards, after all!". And then idiot users could say "welp, I'm not a huge fan of that rule change, but I want as much hashrate as possible above all else, so I'll buy this fork".
But in the real world of real bitcoin users, this is not gonna happen. There are plenty of idiots, but I don't think they're approaching the economic majority. It could happen, but probably not anytime soon.

Unless they were offering a significant discount for doing so, why would anyone waste their bitcoin?
Thinking that if a coffee shop lets you spend bitcoin there, that somehow spending it there will further bitcoin adoption is TOTALLY FALSE. The coffee shop doesn't want bitcoin! They're instantly dumping it for fiat. Even if all its customers lined up to spend bitcoin at the coffee shop, that doesn't influence the coffee shop to actually keep the bitcoin - if anything just the opposite: 
Only when the coffee shop actually wants bitcoin and its customers have it, might it make sense to spend it there. By this time the price will be somewhere around $1 million per coin.
Until then just keep them safely stashed away.

I think the client just requires 6 confirmations to consider the channel established, so 3 was not enough.
Just because two nodes can see each other, doesn't mean they have a direct channel open. Creating the channel is a process initiated by the user (since it involves locking up funds, not something you'd want to do without asking the user), whereas connecting to nodes might be done by automatic discovery (there's no real cost in just making a network connection).

No, not if blocks are full. If the latest block is full, you can try to orphan it, but why? There's no reward and more risk. You might as well just mine the next block. You take a whole new set of highest-fee transactions from the mempool (which will probably have similar fees to the current block), and has the same block reward.
If blocks are NOT full, then it's perhaps worth the risk of trying to replace the current block: because you can take all the fees of the current block, PLUS everything in the mempool.
So do you see the difference? When blocks are full, you can't replace the latest block with another one with twice as many fees, because you'd need to stuff a lot more transactions in it, but you can't because of the block size limit.
Edit: the block reward matters because if it's bigger than the fees, it's not worth the orphan risk, you might as well just build the next block even if you could theoretically orphan the current block and grab a bit more in fees.
Edit: if you want to know why exactly there's more risk orphaning a block than building on it - I am not sure I'm explaining it right but here goes. If you orphan the latest block, you've split the end of the chain in two. Then all the other miners have to pick which one to build on, and they might not pick yours.

This is not how adoption works. Nobody cares about 5 sats. This is just teaching them that bitcoin is a useless joke.
If you want them to "adopt" bitcoin, you have to show them something compelling. AFAICT, the compelling demos are a) buying cool stuff online that you can't buy with a credit card, due to censorship b) making huge gains on your investment.
While it's true LN lets you buy stuff you can't buy w a credit card, it's because it's stuff that is too small for a CC to deal with, and hence not very compelling. "Ooh I just bought the right to read two words of a stupid article" or "I bought the right to paint 5 pixels at satoshis.place". Nobody cares.

The arguments for it being a disaster require conditions that are just never going to happen.
1) LN availability brings in no new users or use cases.
2) The existing users opt for losing liquidity in channels rather than paying $.50 fees, presumably because of modest gains in privacy and/or slightly faster confirmation
I see no reason why people would strongly prefer modest speed/privacy increases over liquidity. Nor do I see any scenario in which there a no new use cases - there certainly will be, because there were old use cases that are no longer viable.

All the halvings have been known since 2009. The idea that the market would just ignore it all that time, but then react shortly before the event occurs (instead of after), seems ludicrous to me.

Ok, there's several arguments in the article.
The first is that a single party appears to have mined about a million coins. Do you agree with that part?
The second part is that this party was Satoshi - which obviously the evidence is a lot weaker. However we do know that it was someone who started mining in the first week. How many miners were there at that time? Doesn't the evidence suggest the vast majority of the early blocks were mined by a handful of parties? 
I think we should be able to conclude (unless you have other objections) that *someone* mined over a million coins, and Satoshi is the most likely candidate out of only a handful of candidates.
For all the economic discussions of bitcoin, we don't even care whether it was Satoshi or not. The evidence suggests one party controls over a million coins.
Edit: you have some objections to the conclusion that it's a single party in other parts of the thread.

FBcoin is not a competitor to bitcoin, it's a competitor to Visa.
Facebook will have complete control, they'll block whatever transaction they don't like, and reverse whichever ones they feel like reversing. They'll seize money from whoever they want.
You get to the checkout counter, what possible motive would you have to pay with FB instead of visa? None. The price will be exactly the same - you're paying credit card fees whether you use a credit card or not, that's already happened. It'll take just as long to pay with FB as swiping a card.
There will be just as much fraud (if not more) than with visa.
There is no reason whatsoever for anyone to give a shit about fbcoin. Just like nobody gives a shit about apple pay.

Miners can't seem to make up their mind whether they're dependent on Core devs to make these changes because no one else can do it ,or not. If that's true, then maybe they should be listening to the only capable devs. If it's not true, what are they waiting for? Other devs can make the changes, they don't have to convince core to do it. Or maybe they think the community will still follow core anyway, in which case the community has spoken and they should accept it.

There's no point in trying to fight the speculative market.
Right now bitcoin is speculative and it's not going to be money until that's over. Let's say a large piece of land rose out of the water adjacent to Manhattan, and you managed to buy some before the price went crazy. Would you feel obligated to immediately start building something on this empty land? You wouldn't right? There's nothing else there yet. You'd probably either hold it for years, or wait for the price to increase massively before selling it to someone who wanted to develop it later.
The point being, that while price discovery is going on, you don't have to actually use the asset for its ultimate purpose. You can just wait for the price to reach the level you know it's going to reach.

I feel like the hardfork worry is overblown.
There's a natural equilibrium. Ledger that follows exactly the rules you want, but nobody else agrees to them - useless to you. Ledger that doesn't follow anywhere near the rules you want, but lots of people to interact with - still useless to you. 
The value of the ledger is basically the product of the consensus group size, and proximity of the ruleset to your own ideal.
There simply can't be that many forks, because it reduces the first term in that product. There will be a natural tendency for them to coalesce because the larger group size overrides small differences in rules.

Personally I think core's got no ulterior motive, there's no secret business plan to somehow profit from small blocks. They actually believe segwit is the responsible way to scale right now.
They are of course, not the only people in the game, but they are experienced and careful. I'm all for exploring alternatives, but it takes time to get everything right. This impatient tantrum of forking to BU is wrong at all levels - the principle doesn't work, and neither does the implementation. 
There is no way to have dynamic blocksize, it ends up giving full control to miners. If we had a mechanism by which bitcoin users could vote on block size, we wouldn't need mining at all, we'd just use that mechanism to vote on how to resolve conflicting transactions (which is the entire purpose of mining).

Then the game is played, then they release the random number. The player can verify the random number is what the casino committed to earlier. (there's more to it than that, but that's the basics - to prove actual randomness, usually the player is allowed to contribute some data to the randomness and then the casino can prove that data was included in the randomness used in the game).

In order for bitcoin to really be an independent monetary system, it has to be used for common everyday payments. Otherwise, its monetary guarantees simply do not hold.
If bitcoin just replaces gold with something easier to secure and transport, the power of seigniorage will reside with states and central banks, just as it does today. It will change nothing. 
The inflation control that bitcoin provides might as well not exist if people cannot use it. To use it, 
 the majority of their spending actually does have to be on chain (or a cache of the chain, like LN).

I'm as big a fan of bitcoin as anyone, but I have no illusions about its acceptance, it's basically nonexistent except for a couple of high-profile retailers.

Number of grocery stores or restaurants that accept bitcoin: zero. Number of people I interact with daily that would let me pay small debts to them in bitcoin: zero.
Edit: and I live in an area with a lot of tech jobs. Bitcoin is not even close to being on the radar.

"Blockchain" has become what "cloud" once was, a buzzword that can be used to mean whatever you want it to mean.
Technically any tree or graph structure with nodes hashchained together can be called a "blockchain". By that definition, git is a blockchain.
But that definition is so broad as to be useless. What really differentiates "blockchain" from "hash chained data structure" is when you can figure out which leaf node is the "correct" one without having to ask a trusted third party.
And I would go even further to say, a blockchain has to be its own ultimate authority. If it's just tracking something like SEC-regulated stocks, it's useless, because the regulators will just step in and overrule the blockchain.

The thing is, nobody knows how much 'buy and hold' and 'sell and stay in fiat' has been happening. Exchange volume is mostly just trading back and forth, so it doesn't tell you anything. For all we know the amount of 'sell and stay in fiat' aside from miners has been tiny. If that's the case, halving could have a massive effect.

I think the position that "there can be only one blockchain, bitcoin" is indefensible. It's supposed to be a voluntary system, so you cannot force people into one set of rules. You choose a set of rules to follow, if it's too customized to your own tastes, then you don't have anyone else to transact with. Conversely, if you compromise your principles too much, you get a system that doesn't do what you want - even though there is a large community. So you have to strike a balance. For most people bitcoin is "close enough" and has a large consensus group. But people should be more than welcome to split off and use other rules.
People worry that this creates an "infinite" amount of coins, but that can't happen. Tiny groups just aren't sustainable. Eventually they find a larger group with rules that are similar enough to satisfy them. In the end there are only a handful of niches.

"Money" doesn't even mean anything anymore. What is a dollar? Is it a balance on a bank account? Physical notes? A promise to some commodity (not anymore). None of those things are remotely scarce or difficult to produce, they become interchangeable. Clearly physical notes are more censorship resistant, but in terms of a bank run, it doesn't matter. Making notes is harder than updating a database row, but still cheap enough. It's all centrally controlled, your money is whatever they say it is.

Once the transaction is confirmed, the buyer cannot do anything to reverse the payment, you should consider the money yours.
Definitely only trust what your own wallet tells you though, don't trust the buyer to tell you it's confirmed.
If it's taking a long time, that's his problem. Make him wait until it's confirmed. How long confirmation will take depends on how large a fee your buyer paid relative to other payments waiting for confirmation. That's all dynamic (new payments showing up all the time, blocks being generated at random times, clearing part of the backlog) - so it's not possible to predict with a ton of accuracy.

Thank you for your responses. I've been curious about this for years.


This is getting offtopic but I don't agree that premines are unethical. (edit: what's unethical is lying, perhaps by omission, about your product) The thought experiment is: 
I create jmw74Coin, and release it with all 100 million coins that will ever exist, premined, by me. I put out a prominent public statement explaining the premine and that I own 100% of all coins. I start selling those coins at auction, and people spend tens of millions of dollars buying them from me.
You and I know those people are idiots for paying such a high price. But selling something for market price is not unethical. In this case I told buyers exactly what my product was, and they wanted to pay far more than I would have accepted.  I don't think there's any ethical duty to cede any of the overlap between what you'd have accepted and what they'd have paid.

Miners don't vote on anything except where the protocol specifically delegates that power to them. Anyone can fork the code and remove that power. 
What they cannot remove is the security provided by hashpower, and that is the only thing that actually matters. The signaling mechanism that is in soft forks now is a really bad proxy for users' wishes, all in the name of avoiding forks, which should not even be a problem. Altcoins already exist, they don't hurt bitcoin.

If you want to avoid civil forfeiture, just use cash but don't carry it all in your car. Realistically nobody bothers tracking cash serial numbers, it'd be extremely time consuming.

How would you do that? Even if you just fork the bitcoin ledger, the new fork would probably have low value and allow early adopters in cheap. To exclude the reset means to be stuck with bitcoin forever, no matter what happens.

That's nowhere close to "delusion" or "new paradigm". That's just bullish sentiment.
There hasn't been any real change in major media coverage of bitcoin. It's had some mainstream exposure here and there all along. Real media coverage is the front page of the New York Times/BBC/CNN, etc. That hasn't been anywhere close to happening, the Satoshi/Wright thing was the most prominent but the average joe on the street still has no clue who Craig Wright is.
Contrast that with Nov 2013, when NPR was broadcasting about the price, it was on the front pages of major media outlets. There's simply no comparision, in terms of sentiment, between then and now. That was mania back then, it's nowhere close to that now.

I totally disagree. It's already been around 6 years. In 9 years I guarantee you, the vast majority of people will still have no idea what it is. They'll probably have heard of it (as many already have), but they will have no idea what its advantages are. It'll still be "that digital currency that no one accepts".
Mainstream adoption is decades away. 20 more years. The internet was created in the late **1960s** and didn't see mainstream adoption until the 2000's.
The reason it won't be adopted much faster than the internet is that authorities (governments, banks, payment companies) are going to fight it tooth and nail. They didn't do that with the internet (although in retrospect many of them wished they had).

TL;DR: "We need to pretty up bitcoin UIs, so that people who have no clue what bitcoin is will start using it".
Bitcoin is a great tool, like say, a hedge trimmer. And here are guys like this author, wringing hands wondering why not everyone is buying the hedge trimmer. Maybe because they don't have any fucking hedges! And when I point out that they don't have hedges, he says, "well they should get some hedges then!" They don't want hedges! They're not interested, leave them alone.
Bitcoin is a tool for disobedience - with it, you can disobey the central bank, local bank, financial regulators, tax authorities, etc. etc. However not everyone has any interest in doing this. 
There are two reasons to buy bitcoin: 
* You wish to disobey
* You wish to obey, but you want to invest in others' disobedience 
Reason  is also considered disobedience, so really there's just reason

Bitcoin is superior to gold, in part because it has no physical location or presence. It can be carried anywhere at zero cost, and with zero chance of it being detected and seized. It is cheaper to secure, it is transferable to anyone in the world at a fraction of the cost and time it would take to transfer gold.
The only thing gold has on bitcoin is tradition.

This is a misunderstanding, bitcoin is energy consuming ON PURPOSE. Without some kind of expense to rolling back the ledger and making changes to old parts, what's stopping anyone from doing it? Nothing.
Proof of stake is bullshit, a perpetual motion machine. It doesn't work - you can't give a token value by using the token's value as the expense. It's like plugging an electrical power strip into itself, and expecting it to work. No coin has ever bootstrapped with proof of stake, that should tell you something. They ALL have started with PoW and then shifted. Just like perpetual motion machines that use an external power source to "get started" and then pretend to keep going under their own power. It's a scam.

It has no effect on adoption. When you want to "adopt" bitcoin, you buy some on the open market. The open market does not depend on mined bitcoin, plenty of existing bitcoin is for sale there now, and will continue to be there as the block reward disappears.
As to how miners will make money without a block reward, the idea is that tx fees alone will support miners. Whether that's lots of transactions with small fees, or few transactions with large fees, or somewhere in between, is still a topic of heated debate.

Miners do not control bitcoin. All they do is select one from conflicting versions of history. They cannot forge transactions, they cannot seize money.

If you want to store a large amount of value, under your full control, in a small physical space, and you are averse to volatility, gold still beats bitcoin. 
However I agree with you that eventually cryptocurrency is going to topple gold. It already beats gold on most measures - it's easier to authenticate, transmit, divide, and secure. It still loses on volatility but I expect that it will approach gold's volatility over time. It also requires at least a mobile phone and internet connection, which gold doesn't, but that isn't a  big deal these days - even homeless people (in the US) often have cellphones.

The coins are actually NOT inferior due to their premine. They're likely overpriced due to their premine. 


Most of these overpaying buyers are not confused in the slightest. They know they have no idea what they are buying.

While I agree the Lerner article is nowhere near any sort of proof, doesn't it make at least a plausible claim? It would seem to, as your alternate explanations seem to be even more unlikely.


That's a good point - although then we're talking about the difference between 1m coins and perhaps 200k, which isn't a huge difference.
For me at least, the important conclusion (that I believe is supported) is that a very large number of coins was mined by a small number of parties (as small as 1). Whether any of those were bitcoin's creator doesn't really matter to me, since the coins' fate will likely be the same regardless of who it was.
I believe they will never move, and the fears that they'll someday be dumped on the market, crashing the price to near-zero, is unfounded. (Even if it was possible, I'd welcome it).

You don't have to prove that any particular coins are lost, though.
Statistically, it's pretty inevitable now. There were many miners in 2010-2012. Roughly a million of those mined coins appreciated as much as 60 million percent and still haven't been sold. There is no other explanation for that many people not cashing out at all, except that they could not do it. The most reasonable explanation is that the vast majority could not cash out because the keys are lost.
That's not proof but I don't see any other reasonable conclusion.

Bitcoin isn't even on their radar, it's a fruit fly buzzing around an elephant. 




That's an overly complex plan. If they intend to not pay back their debt, they could just default. What is the rest of the world going to do against a military that's bigger than the next 40 countries combined?
Or if "defaulting" is too aggressive, they can inflate their debt away by holding gold. Why bother with bitcoin that may or may not exist 20 years from now?
If their plan was to put all their eggs into bitcoin, they'd have already bought in. The current price clearly indicates they have not bought in. An organization with millions of employees does not just "quietly accumulate". Word would get out.

If you have 39 btc that's more than enough for a Trezor to be well worth it to save you time and peace of mind.
Here's what you would do. Set up the Trezor, it will show you 24 words to write down. Put the piece of paper with the words on it in an envelope, seal it. Ideally you should put the envelope somewhere fireproof and not in the same building where you keep your trezor. A bank safe deposit box is a good option.
Set a PIN on the trezor. Optionally, set a password if you are interested in plausible deniability or to prevent someone looking in your seed envelope from stealing your funds.
So, now no one can steal your bitcoin unless they steal the device AND figure out your PIN. They cannot just try all the PIN combinations because the trezor delays each attempt longer and longer.
If you lose your device or it fails, or it gets destroyed in a fire or something, you can still recover your funds. Open the envelope and you can recover your funds on several different software wallets (or a new trezor).

This is a strawman argument, IMO.
I don't think anyone expects bitcoin to do on-chain scaling to Visa levels. Personally I just expect it to keep up with hardware and bandwidth improvements. So far, it hasn't budged. The amount of CPU and bandwidth you get from a commodity laptop and residential internet connection have increased significantly since 2009. Yeah I know, bitcoin doesn't scale linearly with available CPU (or maybe bandwidth either, I'm not sure), but it does scale some, and yet the block size remains 1mb and there is no plans to ever change it. That makes no sense to me.
Now maybe this is just a communication issue and devs really intend to raise the block size limit when it can be done safely. But it seems to me the "safely" goalposts keep moving, and I am not convinced they'll stop moving until bitcoin falls below 50% of the cryptocurrency market.

I disagree.
Almost no one sends bitcoin without knowing the fiat equivalent. Everyone has to convert because otherwise you have no idea how much value you're sending. Someday this conversion will not be necessary, but today it absolutely is. Removing that functionality is screwing their users for no good reason.
Their excuse of "we got tired of people asking why the value was floating" is just ridiculous and lazy UX work on their part. Slapping a label of "market value: $123.45" would not have been that hard.

You cannot mine bitcoin at all with Raspberry pi's.
The only way to mine bitcoin is with ASICs, which AFAIK there is only one major manufacturer who sells to the public - bitmain. 
So yeah, you can buy those and power them with solar. Will you make more money than just investing in bitcoin directly? Probably not, but it's possible.

Sort of, I think publishing is probably the better of the two. The http protocol allowed anyone to publish (online version of magazine, news etc) and anyone to view that publication without a trusted 3rd party.
In the case of the music industry, for the most part content producers (musicians) have failed to participate. They still try to publish via drm-encumbered record companies, and it's only after that some fan puts the music onto bittorrent where it goes the rest of the way. Artists have not accepted that the only viable business model is crowdfunding - once you put content onto the internet, you no longer control it.

I don't see how that was ever going to happen anyway.
Miners would all turn off their machines and never check to see how many other miners did the same? It would be pretty obvious long before the difficulty readjustment. And in fact, the more miners that turn off, the longer the readjustment will take, so it'll be an even more obvious signal to turn them back on.

I don't see how you can conclude this. Before the crisis, people who had no way of paying their mortgage were getting mortgages, which is what drove the housing bubble. That isn't happening anymore.

Worst case is half the hashpower will become unprofitable.

I don't think that's how it works. In a world where there's only bitcoin and it's a constant supply, the only way for the value of bitcoin to really increase is when the size of the economy increases. 
You can't say it's "bad for progress" when it only happens as the economy grows. If anything, I think it would make people think more carefully about what they invest in (unlike today, where they'll throw money at anything that promises even the slightest return).
@_date: 2017-08-11 19:21:28
No, it's in the blocks themselves, and each node interprets them.
Each block has a bit that's either 1 or 0, 1 meaning "ready for segwit". The software is examining each block it receives, and there's some logic somewhere that keeps a tally of whether the threshold of 95% in a particular difficulty adjustment period has been hit. If it is hit, then the node considers segwit locked in. If it's been another 2016 block period since that happened, then it considers segwit active and its rules are enforced.

BCH block time increased by a factor of 45 today. Yesterday blocks were being found roughly every minute, today it's once per hour. Bitcoin relatively unaffected, ranging from 3-6 blocks per hour.

Nah, the whole point of signaling is to decide when to begin enforcing. It's now been decided, so the signaling bit no longer serves any purpose.

Of course just holding cash and never doing anything with it is a bad idea. That's not what Cuban was advocating. He was saying you stay in cash until you see an opportunity. At that point you have liquidity and you're not stuck in some other investment. That's the whole point of cash, after all. It allows you to delay the choice of what you want to spend it on, to the time when there's a good opportunity.


So? This is what my parents said. They got those returns, I didn't. Past performance says nothing about future performance. People who think the stock market will just gain 7% a year forever are delusional. Nothing grows exponentially forever. The trend could end in 1000 years or it could already be over.
There's SP500 vs inflation. It's barely higher than it was 17 years ago, and that's with pretty sketchy measure of inflation. Admittedly I started my career right at the height of the dotcom bubble. But even DCA it makes for some pretty disappointing returns.

The FAQ says 2012, but that's a minor detail. What was holding back block sizes before that? Was it just hardcoded (meaning that instead of miners just changing a command line option, they would have had to recompile to make larger blocks)? If so, that's not much of a hurdle. On the order of minutes of extra work.
None of this really changes my point, because the same relative soft limits could be in place now with a higher hard limit. Either bitcoin was dangerously exposed in 2011, or it's safe to raise the hard limit now. Again I have no problem if you agree with the former, but to deny both seems inconsistent.

Bitcoin is primarily a tool to disobey authority. Such authorities are: drug enforcement, tax authorities, central banks, monopolistic payment processors, financial regulatory bodies, etc.
The number of people in the world that have even the potential to think about possibly disobeying any of these authorities, is tiny. Millions of people, sure, but not billions. 
To all the people expecting their friends and family to follow them into bitcoin, forget it. It's not going to happen. Not next year, not 10 years from now.

They may try, but blockchains and centralized control are mutually exclusive. So either governments will create it and not control it (in which case, why bother, just use bitcoin), or they'll control it and it will be useless (why bother with a distributed consensus mechanism when there's no distributed consensus - everything is centrally managed, it's just a waste of resources).


Not really, they just make different tradeoffs than bitcoin does. For example - monero is untraceable but requires more resources, ethereum is more flexible but much harder to understand and apparently doesn't have trustless bootstrap (with proof of stake).

You can't have it both ways. 
Either bitcoin's 1,000,000 byte limit was dangerously high in 2009 or it's unacceptably low now. 
If it's the former, and bitcoin was just a spam attack away from destruction all that time, I can accept that, but I don't think I've ever seen you explicitly state that.

That has nothing to do with KYC. KYC is knowing your personal details, where your money comes from etc. What you're talking about is just making sure the person withdrawing is the same person who created the account, without knowing anything further about them.

No, but if satoshi wants to remain anonymous, he can't cash in a single coin that's known to be his. So far it looks like he wants to remain anonymous, and whatever reason he has for doing so, is unlikely to cease to be a reason. He may also be dead, and/or the private keys lost or deliberately destroyed.
Besides, satoshi doesn't own anywhere close to 50% of bitcoin, even if he could cash it all in.
And why shouldn't satoshi be rich anyway? He invented something useful and had the foresight to hold onto something that would later become very valuable. Compare that to banks where they did nothing except already have a lot of money to pay regulators.

It was your metaphor, not mine. 
Personally, I think bitcoin can never be mainstream, it's a niche product. Giving up censorship resistance for a shot at popularity that can never happen anyway, is just stupid. 1mb is enough for a while. If fees get ridiculously high, then a hard fork will happen, I'm not worried.

You don't have to send your existing coins to segwit addresses, that seems rather pointless - but you can receive any new coins on segwit addresses and those transactions will get the segwit discount (assuming miners correctly weigh it).

Well, he is correct that miners vote on when a rule change activates. I think that is a silly and overly complex mechanism.
Bitcoin should have embraced and prepared for actual forking from the beginning, but instead has chosen a route of letting miners represent users, which is totally wrong. The incentives of users and miners are definitely NOT the same - sometimes they're aligned, sometimes not.
I grant that it's not easy to manage multiple forks. "Do you take bitcoin?" "Yes, well, only bitcoin-fork-A and C, not B." "Wait, which one is B?" "The one with 16mb blocks but not the rollback exception from 2017". 
Managing names can be done, but it's still hard. If the consensus rules never needed updating, it would be straightforward, but if you do update them, you can't tell whether the new and old versions are 100% compatible. Just because they agree on the same chain now, doesn't mean they always will.

Bitcoin does a perfectly good job of scaring away average citizens on its own, it doesn't need any help from lawmakers.
On-chain bitcoin payments will never be mainstream even if "the powers that be" do nothing. It may get popular as a unit of account - in other words, bitcoin banks that hold your money for you, and probably do fractional reserve just like they do now.
I'm not sure how that would play out, you'd think that bitcoin promises would decouple in price from actual bitcoin, if the promises were inflated. However that doesn't seem to happen with gold (paper gold and delivered gold don't differ much in price). I have no idea why - I find it really hard to believe all the gold promises are actually backed by real gold.

Looks to me like the soft-limit was just miners voluntarily limiting their blocks. Nothing was enforced by validating nodes, miners could have just started their nodes with -blockmaxsize=1mb.
You're saying that was effective then, but it wouldn't be now. What changed? I don't think the halving would have had much effect. We trusted miners to not allow the network to be overloaded then, but we can't trust them with this now?

No, I'm not talking about market timing, that's basically TA and TA is bunk.
I'm talking about an opportunity where you see the value in something, that the market hasn't seen yet.
Let me give you an example from the crypto world (I don't buy stocks anymore so I have no example, but you can imagine a similar one): Way back before segwit activated in litecoin, its price was hovering around $4 and stable for quite some time. Why wasn't the market reacting to the possibility that Litecoin could activate segwit while bitcoin floundered with infighting? There wasn't any, the market was just late. I bought litecoin at $4 and a week later it exploded up to the mid-20s, inarguably for the exact reason that should have been obvious to everyone already. One of the most no-brainer investments of my life, and I should have bet bigger in hindsight. That's an opportunity.

I'm giving gemini a shot, coinbase has been a disappointment, mostly because they keep demanding more KYC info and no matter how much I tell them, they keep asking for more. They're now asking:
* Where all my fiat comes from, goes to
* Where all my bitcoin comes from, goes to
* What websites I use
* My linkedin profile
That said, coinbase has been pretty reliable, and the few times I've needed support it was slow but they did eventually get the job done. It's the ridiculous levels of privacy invasion that are driving me away.
Also their 2FA setup sucks, but actually gemini's is even worse. Text messages are NOT an appropriate way to do 2FA - texts are too easy to intercept. I don't think Authy is appropriate either, since IIUC you can always reset your Authy account (and so can an attacker). Basically, if it's not possible for you to lose your 2FA token then it isn't secure. Exchanges like to use tokens that can't get lost because when users lose them it's a lot of work for support to manually re-identify you. They just don't bother. But this puts YOU at risk - if someone intercepts your token, and drains your account, the exchange will just shrug and deny all responsibility.

I agree - but "more and more" means going from 0.01% to 1%. 50% is completely out of reach.
The reason I believe it's out of reach is that bitcoin is disobedience. Not necessarily disobedience of government authorities, but of third parties in general. "You want me to conduct business with your permission and pay you a fee? Fuck you". Those are the people who use bitcoin. They are, almost by definition, a small minority. 
What's going to happen is more and more people will choose the "fuck you" path until the third parties sweeten the deal enough to lure them back. I think it will find equilibrium somewhere in the 1-10% range of "fuck you"s.
@_date: 2017-01-10 21:23:14


No. Fees are calculated based on what miners have accepted into their blocks recently (edit: and the txs currently sitting in the mempool). Yes, the size of the tx matters, but only relative to other txs. With segwit all the txs will get smaller so it has no bearing on miner revenue, aside from the fact that more txs will fit into a block. The effect there will very likely be **higher** revenue, assuming the demand for the additional block space is high enough.
@_date: 2016-06-08 13:13:08
Yeah, good luck to everyone trying to find any place for rent that accepts bitcoin, or anything else for that matter. Here's what you can realistically buy directly with bitcoin:
* electronics
* home goods
* internet services (vpn etc)
* digital content (games, media)
Here are things that you generally cannot buy with bitcoin:
* Homes (either renting or owning)
* Insurance
* utilities (water, power, phone etc)
* groceries
So basically if you try to live on bitcoin alone, you'll be homeless and hungry. Not to mention the number of jobs available that pay in bitcoin is basically zero.

Laundering is hiding the source of your income. For example, making it look like you got your income from a car wash that you own, rather than your meth business (as occurs in Breaking Bad).
That is not what mixing does, necessarily. If I buy bitcoin with dollars that everyone knows I earned via my job as a plumber, mix the bitcoin, and spend it on a darknet market, then I have not laundered money. I have simply broken the connection between my income and my spending. Everyone still knows the source of my income, they just don't know what I spent it on.
This is exactly how cash already works. I earn money as a plumber, withdraw it as cash from the bank, and go to Vegas. Nobody knows where that money went. It's perfectly legal and acceptable to do this with cash, but for some reason the Dutch authorities have a problem with it if it's digital cash.

I think there's a continuum of security, and room for more than one cryptocurrency.

Right now it's still a speculative investment.
It doesn't matter how superior a currency **would be** at being money if people used it, **if they don't use it**.
As it stands today, bitcoin is simply not accepted as money. What you're speculating on (among other things) when you buy bitcoin, is that one day it will be accepted. 
You may also speculate that it won't be money, but rather a gold-like commodity. Which again, today it is not.
Personally I'd rather speculate on the latter - bitcoin's superiority to gold is much more apparent than its superiority to the dollar.

Where are you getting the idea that segwit cuts future fees to miners in half?
@_date: 2017-01-10 16:09:08
I think you misunderstand what I meant by "happened". 
I am not referring to the wall clock time of the physical action of creating the data. I'm talking about a deterministic order of events in our imaginary database.
If B is chained to A, then B happened after (from our db's point of view). There's no ambiguity there, no possibility of disagreement.
You cannot have bidirectional hash chaining. You can't chain B to A and also A to B. Hashing algorithms are supposed to be irreversible. To chain B on top of A, you have to decide A's contents first. You can't know the hash of B yet, because it depends on the contents of A. Once you decide the contents of A, it's too late to include B's hash in A. You can only include A's hash in B. One direction only.
@_date: 2017-01-10 18:10:11
Yeah, I think we're agreeing here.
The important part here is resolving conflicts, which is what PoW does. However, you can use hash chaining to assert that some information existed at the time you created yours. For example, in source control systems, if you build off some other developer's change, and it's hash-chained, you can't later claim his change was done after yours was submitted. You are acknowledging the existence of his change by including its hash in yours.

Based on that advice you shouldn't buy bitcoin either. That's precisely the advice that is completely wrong.
What you should buy is something you have reason to believe the market is wrong about. Bitcoin is one of those things - all the "professionals" are completely clueless about it - still! That's one of the reasons cryptocurrency has been so lucrative. It's an area where the "professionals" are essentially helpless and cryptonerds have a distinct advantage.
The same principle goes for stocks, but admittedly it's difficult to find stocks where the professionals are clueless about it. It's not impossible though.

Chances of it being lower than when I bought it in 5 years is probably less than 1% or maybe single digits. I know a lot of people disagree, but that's why I am taking their bets.

You don't need a blockchain unless you want to be able to figure out whose version of history to use, without asking a central authority.
The central bank **is** the central authority. They even have "central" in their name! That's who you ask to figure out the right version of history of the ledger they created.
However I guarantee you, even this takes away more power than the government wants to give up. You see, even if they decide which version of history to use, they still cannot outright seize money. They want to outright seize money. Once they realize they can't do this without just running a plain old database, they're just going to run a plain old database.

Explain it to me then, because it doesn't look like you can explain this with just a difficulty change. 
The backlog grew by 50k txs in 7 hours. That's about 8k growth per hour. Previously, there was about 10k txs included in blocks per hour with no backlog growth. In order to explain this backlog growth simply in terms of slower blocks, you'd have to have slowed from 10k txs per hour to 2k txs per hour to get a net backlog growth of 8k per hour? 
The difficulty reset did not reduce the block rate by 80%. Not even close.

A network is a network. As long as all the participants can receive data somehow, it doesn't matter if it's mesh or traditional. 
Paper will never be used. It'd take an awfully long time to manually validate a transaction on paper.

It really depends on your alternative. If you were going to use paper wallets or offline machines instead, consider how much time and effort that would take (much more than a hardware wallet). 
If you were just going to use your online machine and take the risks, then your rule of thumb applies more.

No, the sum of the hashes won't work because one early low-difficulty block will ruin it for the entire chain no matter how much work comes later.
Pieter Wuille:  "We look at the amount of work in each chain: the expected number of hashes that were necessary to build them. This loosely corresponds to the sum of the difficulties of the blocks in both chains (which is almost always the same as just comparing the length, unless the fork spans a retarget)."

There aren't too many possible flaws that would be fatal. Nearly all of them would be recoverable.
The main fatal flaw would be if the signature algorithm was broken such that anyone could spend anyone else's coins. Those algorithms are used elsewhere and have been used by bitcoin for 8 years. No one has broken them yet. Crypto algorithms usually don't fail all at once, they get slowly more vulnerable to brute force as computers get faster. (edit: also algorithmic optimizations are found to make brute forcing easier, but still far from trivial) So it's likely that before the signature algorithm failed, we'd see it coming and move to something stronger.

If you have several trezors and you don't have a secure place to store seeds such that you're not worried about someone viewing the seed, you can set up multisig. Put the seeds for each trezor in different places, and put the coins in (for example) a 2 of 3 multisig address where any 2 of the 3 trezors can sign to spend the funds. I have not done this myself, but I think copay wallet supports this.
Personally I just have 1 trezor but I keep the seed and password in 2 different places.

These are upgrade rules built into the software. There's some condition that when met, "locks in" the new rule, and then there's a delay before it actually starts getting enforced. But once it's locked in there's basically no going back.
So in this case, segwit locks in at the end of this 2016 block period (the condition is that 95% of those 2016 blocks have the segwit signaling bit in them). And then the segwit rules activate 2016 blocks after that.

Hash chaining does provide some value - if you've chained B on top of A, then you know the information in A must have existed before B was created.
This does not prevent double spends though, because you can still chain B and C on top of A, such that B and C have conflicting transactions (double spends). Without PoW or some consensus mechanism, you can't resolve the conflict - both B and C are equally valid, they just can't both be valid simultaneously. 
But at least everyone can agree in that case that B and C happened after A.

Coming back to bitcoin, 1mb is sufficient right now, that may change, but i don't expect it to anytime soon. When fees are consistently $10 then I'll be a lot more sympathetic to hardfork proposals. Even if bitcoin has a huge bubble I still don't expect to see $10 fees.

While we're at it, get rid of income tax altogether, and move everything to property tax.
It's going to happen eventually anyway. Once crypto becomes the norm, the government will have no way to enforce income tax. Property tax also aligns with what government actually provides: a monopoly on force. If you want your property rights physically defended, pay the big guns in the form of property tax. Income tax is just needlessly invasive.
And there's even a neat idea to bypass "assessment" (whereby your property's market value is estimated to determine how much tax you owe): Don't assess, let each person self-report his own property's value. The wrinkle is, they actually have to put it for sale at that price. So if you have a $500,000 house, and you try to get out of property tax by listing it at $1, someone will just instantly buy it and you'll be out on the street. In fact, you have to value your house at what it's worth to YOU, not the market. If you know you could sell your house for $500k but it's not worth it for you to move your family, you'd have to list it at a big enough premium that you know no one will take it (or if they do, you make enough money to be fairly compensated. Say, $1m). The tax rate would take this premium into account, of course, since nearly every homeowner would be paying it. 
So if everything was property tax, the rate would have to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 10%. That would probably cause rent prices to roughly double, but everyone would have their entire income to spend on rent, instead of only ~75%, so overall it should be a wash.

That's a point that I think a lot of bitcoin users don't get (or haven't thought about).
Why do miners care if a transaction is valid or not? They only care because that's how they get paid (currently). If the transaction isn't valid, they aren't getting paid. If they were paid non-natively (outside the transactions they're mining) they wouldn't need to care if they're valid or not.
And really, all miners do is resolve conflicts between two events (they decide which one "wins"). They don't need to interpret the events at all to perform this service.
Bitcoin uses native payments because before bitcoin existed, there wasn't an irreversible remote payment method. But now that bitcoin *does* exist, it's entirely possible for another blockchain to be mined by paying them in bitcoin (microtransactions perhaps). In that case, the miner would not even need to see the transaction data at all, they would only need to see its hash. So that offers a sort of censorship resistance (miners could not discriminate on the content of the transaction, because they couldn't see it until after they'd mined it). It has drawbacks too though, which I won't go into here.
@_date: 2018-10-03 21:14:46
Those things definitely matter, but you're right there's always the backstop of economic incentive to mine honestly.
However, consider how much the US govt stands to lose if the dollar loses its position as reserve currency, vs how costly it would be to attack bitcoin into oblivion (even if you assume bitcoin is much more secure than it is today). It does not look good. They can just print money to build miners and buy power, at zero real cost to them. Sure, they're inflating the money supply, but by the time the people realize what's happening and decide to switch to bitcoin, bitcoin will be long dead.
E: it's possible bitcoin (or something like it) could make a comeback after such an attack, but gaining trust would be a long process.

Common misconception. What miners do is resolve conflicts between transactions (when you get two transactions, A-&gt;B and A-&gt;C, where it's clear A can't be spent twice, but nobody is sure which one occurred "first"). Miners decide which one was "first". That's it. That is all they do. If there was no need for preventing doublespends, there would be no need for mining at all.
Miners only care about bitcoin's rules because they are paid in bitcoin. If we didn't need to pay them somehow, or we paid them in dollars, they wouldn't even need to **know** the bitcoin rules. They would just indicate which content they saw first and not care what the contents actually are.

Hashpower follows value, not the other way around.
Miners will mine whatever is profitable. Let's say there's a $4000 chainA and a $400 chainB. If all the miners switch from chainA to chainB, they will all lose huge amounts of money (they'll be burning more electricity than the coin reward is worth).
The equilibrium is where 90% of the miners are on chainA and 10% on chainB.
You may argue that if chainB has lower fees, why wouldn't it be worth more? Well, there are hundreds of alts with near-zero fees, and yet they're all worth much less than bitcoin. Clearly low fees is nowhere near the most important thing in a coin's value.

It still makes sense in some cases. There are other ways to resolve conflicting transactions (double spends). Proof of stake, for example. The problem with Proof of Stake is that it does not allow someone to join the network late, and reliably determine the current winning chain completely on their own. They have to ask someone (and trust that answer). However, from then on, they can figure out the winning chain on their own.
I think what you're getting at is these Wall Street types want a system they control (have the power to censor transactions etc). Blockchain tech is useless to them in that case, I believe. Either they control it or they don't. If they don't, they might as well use bitcoin, because anything they create will just be at best a less popular version of it. If they do want to control it, they might as well use a database just like they already do.
I've heard it said that there's a use case for "a consortium of banks who want a consensus mechanism among themselves but no one else is allowed in". I just don't get it.

Anyone can mine bitcoin. You do not need to apply, or register or even tell anyone your name. You can buy mining equipment and just plug it in. In that sense it's perfectly "fair", there's no group of people who are allowed to create bitcoin while the rest are forbidden. You used to be able to use regular computers to do it, but the specialized stuff is so much more efficient today that it's pointless to even try with a desktop computer.
You have to remember that mining has costs. First of all you need the equipment, and second the mining process is extremely power-intensive. It requires lots of electricity. If your electricity isn't cheap you're likely to end up paying more for power than the value of the bitcoin you mine. 
Dollars have not been backed by gold since the 1970's.

It has nothing to do with the "cutting edge". It's a censorship resistant currency and payment system. It'd be great if a home computer could verify the whole world's coffee purchases, but it can't. So we do need to draw the line somewhere. 
The reason not to scale at the cost of security is because nobody has trouble paying for coffee now. How would bitcoin help them? It's just not a good use case.

You've been bamboozled.
Shapeshift, coinbase, etc only contribute to "economic majority" to the degree that they decide at what price they buy and sell coins. For the most part, they don't. At all. 
Coinbase's users decide price. Shapeshift uses prices from other exchanges.
The chain that survives will be the one that people want to pay money to hold. Companies that aren't holding their own coins will have much less influence than you've been led to believe.

Assume that no one is selling bitcoin besides miners. By "sell" I mean, sell and not buy back anytime soon. Under this assumption there are 3600 bitcoins for sale every day at roughly $500-$700, and all being bought in that price range. Imagine that from July 11 on, only 1800 bitcoins will be for sale every day.  What happens to the price? There will be a bidding war to figure out who gets them, because there isn't enough for everyone at the current price level. How much higher will it go? Even if this assumption of "only miners are selling" held, the price won't necessarily exactly double. It really depends on how badly people want the bitcoins. 
In reality, this assumption isn't true - there are more people who "sell and don't buy back" than just the miners. We don't know how many more. It could be relatively small compared to what miners produce, or relatively large.
My gut says "relatively small". Nobody is getting *out* of bitcoin for the long term at these prices.

What would you call it? Is it or is it not possible for the ~2 miners (or is it 3 now?) to coordinate to make the inflation schedule of BCH to completely diverge from what its users were sold (which was supposed to be the same schedule as bitcoin)?
You can handwave this away perhaps with "oh, but they know that's bad for long term value so they won't do it", but that attack just doesn't exist on the main bitcoin chain.
From what I understand, BCH's inflation now has a ceiling of roughly 18% a year (if miners manage to push through 2016 block periods in 3 days instead of the scheduled 14).

I think it's cute how miners think they decide the rules of the network.
Granted, they may be acting on what they believe is the will of bitcoin users, hard to say. Even so, this isn't the right way to go about it. 
The only real way to signal demand for hashpower is to fork and have the market assess the values of the various forks. If a fork is under-secured (a lot of market value and low hashpower), it will be very profitable to mine it and miners will switch. 
I guess miners are free to create the forks themselves, but miners voting amongst themselves on which fork to mine is ridiculous.

Apparently, you can deposit any amount of old cash, but withdrawals are limited. However, I would suppose that you can deposit cash and then buy bitcoin with it so that you end up with digital cash.
Now, I would not think that criminals are going to do this (depositing large amounts of cash will be suspicious). But legit cash holders might do it.
Those wishing to avoid scrutiny might swap cash for bitcoin with multiple individuals so that the deposits are broken up and less suspicious - but this seems pretty labor intensive.

Yeah, that is just the somewhat messy way that wallet chose to handle it. AFAIK there's no inherent reason they need to be separate wallets, was probably just easiest for them to develop it that way to get it released quickly.
Two ways you can handle this:
1) Always send from the legacy wallet and always receive on the segwit wallet, until the legacy wallet is empty
2) Move all your funds to the segwit wallet yourself, using a low fee transaction and just wait a few days for it to be confirmed.

You don't think this is a problem, that it's so difficult to understand bitcoin well enough to produce a working implementation?
I'm a software developer and I know a fair amount of crypto (probably equivalent to several months of full time study), how long would it take me to analyze the bitcoin core source to say, "yep, it does what it says"?

You have to keep in mind that locations on the planet **that you can remember** are **not** random. Memorable "square feet" are actually very rare (not in the middle of a desert, forest, or ocean), and so actually have much less entropy than randomly chosen spots.
What you're attempting here is "security by obscurity" and there are people out there with sophisticated brute force tools to sweep brain wallets that use schemes like this.

If StashCrypto's off-chain functionality is based on OpenTransactions (and I believe it is), then it has a whole different set of security properties than LN.
The main difference is, OT balances are promises, not the actual asset. You may have a balance of "bitcoin" or "ounces of gold" on an OT server, but you don't actually possess the bitcoin or gold - the issuer does, and you must trust the issuer to give you back the real asset if you ask for it.  Also, proving that the server is not inflating the promises is hard. By inflating, I mean, the server creates its own account from nothing, and writes in a balance of a trillion, and proceeds to buy real things with that made-up balance. Proving that's not happening generally involves some kind of broadcast network to ensure the issuer finds out that the server is making promises the issuer cannot redeem. Not sure if StashCrypto has implemented that or not, but probably not. OT can handle any kind of fungible asset, though.
That's totally different than LN, where balances are not promises, they are actual bitcoin.

I love seeing articles (especially in supposedly technical-minded magazines) where the author and the people quoted have absolutely no idea what bitcoin really is. That means we're still very very early in the growth curve.
Bitcoin's programmability is a nice feature, but not what makes it special. Any bank could implement that too. What's important here is that banks will never do that because they do not care about their customers. They are insulated by a mountain of regulations and they haven't done anything new, technologically, for 50 years. The biggest innovations they've come up with is the ATM, and mobile check deposit. Yeah, that's right, their idea of technology is using your mobile camera to take a picture of a paper check, and then wait 3 days for it to show up in your account. What's important here is that bitcoin works without anyone's permission.
Whether bitcoin is a currency today really doesn't matter. It is what it is, part commodity, part currency, whatever.
@_date: 2016-12-09 15:11:44
Yes, there are hazards on both sides:
* Too expensive to receive any transactions (so there's no point in running a validating node)
* Too expensive to run a node that validates everyone's transactions (so there's no point in receiving any transactions)
However it's not equally balanced, as others point out. If it's too expensive to run a full node, SPV security is still better than most other transaction systems. If it's too expensive just to transact, then there is no graceful degradation, you're completely frozen out. Yes, there's layer-2 solutions that reduce fees, but they still involve some on-chain transactions.

Well, there's no magic scaling solution that increases capacity without sacrificing security. 
The problem is that most people think of their everyday purchases, (coffee, food, housing, transportation etc) - nobody is trying to censor most of that. They just want cheap and convenient and they're willing to sacrifice other people's security- the people who are doing things that someone IS trying to censor.

For the most part, it shouldn't. If you want a transaction that is unstoppable and irreversible, be prepared to pay what it costs.
If you don't need that, then use something else. Bitcoin is doing its best to provide other ways of paying than the direct on-chain method. I don't see any reason why bitcoin banks are not sufficient for coffee purchases. What are you worried about, that the bank will stop you from buying coffee, or that they'll inflate the relatively small amount of bitcoin they control? If that's not good enough, LN offers a middle ground with relatively high security and inflation protection.
I think there's theoretically room for everyone to get what they want, even with small blocks. It's just going to take time to develop the infrastructure.

Wow, that's crazy. If people need more than $300 in cash in a week and they never even held any of the old bills at all, they are SOL? What if they want to buy a car or something (from a private seller, not a dealer, for example).
Or are you saying that withdrawals are only limited for people who deposited old bills? That wouldn't make much sense - what if you had $1m in the bank and deposited $1000 worth of old bills, then you can't withdraw more than $300 of your original money either?
In that case, I could see how bitcoin might help as an alternate form of cash, however USD would be more attractive, IMO. The value is more stable, and bitcoin's ability to be sent over distance doesn't matter here. Even if you could deposit cash in other people's account in exchange for bitcoin, it would seem to be even more suspicious than depositing cash in your own account.

Ok, I find your estimate of 3% way more plausible than zero. I think we can all agree that zero is impossible, and so is 50%.

Bitcoin doesn't need to scale. Or at least, it doesn't need to sacrifice even a tiny bit of censorship resistance to scale.
The vast majority of people using bitcoin right now are just fucking around. Speculating, buying crap that nobody cares about that they could have just as easily bought on amazon with a debit card.
Guess what, nobody buys socks with gold either. Does that mean gold is broken? No.

"Burn" addresses are addresses for which it's generally agreed it is impossible for the private key to be known by anyone.
I don't know the exact procedure for creating one, but it's basically, take some words that use the base58 characters. That itself probably won't be a valid address (there is a checksum, so most arbitrarily chosen addresses are not valid). So you keep incrementing the characters at the end until you get one that is valid. That's why the address posted below has some random characters at the end.
 1BitcoinEaterAddressDontSendf59kuE
No one could have the private key for this, because normally addresses are the hash of a key. Since hashes are indistinguishable from random, someone would have had to create a **vast** number of keys before they could find one that hashed to the above value. It's a number so large as to be totally infeasible, so the above address has no known key. If you send to it, the coins will be stuck there forever.

FWIW I don't think any blocks will actually get orphaned. Dissenting miners will give up at just the threat of having their blocks orphaned. That would be utterly disastrous to a mining pool, they would have to be complete idiots to try to resist. It would destroy **all** their revenue and actually give more revenue to the attacking miners. It would not be possible for the dissenters to "wait it out", they have no leverage unless they can get a majority (or at least close enough to sow some doubt in the other camp).
I know it would set a bad precedent, but I still see the opposition to segwit as not having a leg to stand on.

Coinbase is not useless. There are a lot of people who hold bitcoin now, who wouldn't be holding it if coinbase didn't exist. I'm normally critical of them, but that's not because their service is useless. It's because their support sucks, and they have hidden policies that sometimes result in users accounts being closed or transactions being blocked. However I'm the first to admit that most users have no problems, and get the service that coinbase advertises. I'm one of them.
Yes, you do have to submit KYC info, that's not coinbase's fault and they're up front about it (if you don't want to submit it, just don't - there's no obligation).
Coinbase is like a lot of companies with bad support. A lot of mobile carriers and ISPs are the same way. The truth is though, that most users never need support, so the service may still be worth the price.

The problem is more fundamental than that. 
Wallets can only do what users want. If users can't decide how much they're actually willing to pay for the transaction, then nobody can help them.
That's the issue, everyone is saying "I'll just pay whatever it costs", so "what it costs" keeps going up almost without limit.

Hardware wallets use a sort of paper wallet as a backup in case you lose the device, or it breaks down.
The difference is, the secret key that goes into the backup cannot be seen by your computer. You write down words that are displayed on the screen of the hardware wallet, and those can be used to restore your wallet later (either onto a new hardware wallet, or a software wallet on your smartphone or computer).
In this sense it is more secure than a paper wallet, because even if your computer has malware, it will not be able to capture the secret key when it is created. If you lose your device and restore the backup onto a software wallet, it could be theoretically captured by malware then. If you're worried about that, you should restore your backup onto a new hardware wallet instead.

You have to define what "backed by" means.
Normally it means "there is some central authority figure who will always exchange X amount of this currency for Y amount of something else."  For example: "FooBucks are backed by gold, you can redeem 100 FooBucks for 1 ounce of gold down at the government office".
Using this definition, bitcoin is not "backed" by anything, because there's no authority figure making any guarantees. The US dollar is not "backed" by anything either, the US government will not redeem dollars for anything else.
Edit: I should point out that these authority figures who promise to "always" redeem this currency, well, they eventually stop doing it. So in that sense there is no currency in history that is "backed by" anything in the long term.

I think some of your assumptions are not quite right.
Yes, users are incentivized to avoid paying fees. But they're also incentivized to avoid censorship - which they cannot do by having only one channel. I don't see any reason to believe equilibrium is at 1 channel per user. That may be true of users who don't care about censorship resistance, but not all users.
Also, my understanding is that channels can be replenished - by issuing a new refund transaction on chain. Yes, that's another fee, but it is only one transaction instead of two (closing the channel and opening another with the same party).
@_date: 2017-08-28 17:54:17
It's pretty simple, large corporations are deeply invested in the status quo. They are cozy with regulators - the unspoken agreement is "we'll follow your rules as long as your rules favor us over smaller competitors".

The way merchants accept bitcoin today has far worse problems than this.
The price of an irreversible (cash) payment must always be less than a reversible one. Otherwise what incentive does the buyer have to use the irreversible form? None. He might as well use the reversible one in case of dispute.
Visa and MC use their cartel to prevent price discovery here. As long as that's the case, bitcoin payments for everyday items will remain near zero.
I think bitcoin/cash  prices should be about 3% below credit card prices, if there was actually a free market.

Right, to clarify, I'm assuming here that the segwit supporters end up with 90% or so. That too low for them just to bring more miners online (they'd have to double their capacity to reach 95%). But it's high enough to pull off the orphaning attack with very high probability.
Also, it depends on how badly the miners are interested in segwit. If they don't care that much either way, they won't take any risk with an orphan attack. However if they think it's crucial to the future of bitcoin, they will be more likely to consider every avenue available to them.
Edit - and the important point here is just that the segwit opposers **know** the majority can pull off the attack with very high probability, then it is very unlikely to be necessary.
Edit2 - the other possible approach a 90% coalition could take is to bribe individual miners away from the other pools. Maybe half of the 10% of dissenting miners aren't so steadfast in their opposition that a little grease wouldn't get them to move. I'm not sure which move is more costly. As you said, there are software development costs associated with the orphan attack (even if you just threaten the attack, it'd help to have the software change demonstrably implemented).

It is possible to hard fork without complete chaos, but at the very least the fork has to alter the protocol to prevent replays.
The general sentiment seems to be against this sort of precaution, I can only guess because of pure hubris - that each fork expects to win outright and thinks it doesn't have to bother with replay protection. The problem is if it doesn't win outright, then users on both forks get screwed.
@_date: 2016-11-01 20:29:25
So? You can't just pretend there haven't been any losses. You have to make the best estimate you can. By any reasonable estimate, a lot of coins are lost - it's hard to figure any risk-adjusted estimate that comes out to much less than 1m coins.

"once you address the problem of governance, you no longer need blockchain; you can just as well use conventional technology that assumes a trusted central party to enforce the rules, because you’re already trusting somebody (or some organization/process) to make the rules."
That's the central argument and it's just wrong. You don't have to trust anyone to make the rules. You can sell your stake in one set of rules, and buy another, at any time. There's a trade-off of course, perhaps the new rules aren't as widely agreed upon.

It doesn't matter if the company buys shares back. The whole point of shares is that it's a share of future profits. Stocks would be worth nothing if there was never going to be dividends. If you buy them with bitcoin you need to expect the shares to pay off more than the bitcoin would.

Yeah, I think those functions would just be guesswork and wouldn't align well with the long term health of the network.
Somehow, the ability of participants on the network to process those blocks in a timely fashion, must be taken into account. And this solution doesn't take that into account at all. 
Unfortunately I don't think it's possible to get a consensus on participants' processing abilities. If there was some way to avoid sybil attack, we'd just use that to choose creators of the next block and not bother with mining.

Because naive people think the future will be like the past.
If bitcoin price has been declining, they assume it will continue to decline. Bitcoin is a "scam" because any money spent on it will be lost.
However when bitcoin price is rising, people assume it will continue to rise. They see a great investment opportunity. 
Of course, they won't necessarily be wrong in either case, but it's as likely to go either direction. Unless they know something that the market in general does not, which they don't.
@_date: 2016-12-28 12:15:48
The point that's being overlooked here is lifestyle changes. If you've made enough profit in bitcoin that your lifestyle would be significantly improved vs losing it all, it's probably time to stop taking risks. For example if you make $50k a year and you have $500k in profits, that's ten years salary. You could stop working for ten years. That's large enough to stop taking risks with it. But if you've only got $10k in profits, seems perfectly reasonable to risk it to go for more.
If you were at a casino and you found a table that lets you make a 1 time bet with 60% odds, you'd be a fool to pass it up, even though there's still a 40% chance you'll lose the bet. You shouldn't necessarily bet the max you can afford to lose, depends on how many times in your life you expect to find odds like that.

When you're looking at historical data, you can't be sure from the data alone when anything happened. You can get ordering from hash-chaining, but you don't know whether anything was created just now or years ago.
If you were participating in a relay network, you can say "well, this thing claims to be created at date X, but I was online at date X and didn't see this until date X+10000, so I know it's lying". 
This doesn't work if you were offline and join the network later, and are presented with multiple histories all claiming to be the "real" one. That's what proof of work fixes, but (according to nullc) this scheme does not.

Yes, I'm aware that it's conjecture. So?
Put another way, do you really think that early CPU miners in 2009/2010 **didn't** just get bored with bitcoin, deleted the files and didn't think about it again until bitcoin started hitting the news? Plus of course there's a nonzero chance that satoshi's coins will never be spent. So I think we have no choice but to conjecture if we want an accurate model of the market, and a rigorous conjecture will come out with a large number of coins lost.

How the hell is this a "user flaw in bitcoin"? 
Bitcoin is **digital cash**. You should treat the seed and password as the equivalent to a pile of cash, because that's exactly what it is. If you lose it, it's gone. No one seems to have a problem putting their pile of cash somewhere that they can find it later. 
Edit: the problem is with expectations - people think that because it's on a computer screen, that it's like fiat banking (where there's some authority who can fix your mistakes). Well, there isn't, and I think if you know anything about bitcoin, you should know that. Most wallets do a pretty good job of communicating to you that you **must** save your seed. You ignored the warning, probably because you were still assuming bitcoin works like a regular bank.

It won't. The masses don't care, and they never will. Here's an analogy - the internet allows you to be your own newspaper. Do you run your own newspaper? Sure, some people do (blogs, etc), and that's great, but the vast majority don't. What if someone proposed a "fix" to the internet that made publishing articles trivially easy but it made the entire internet more prone to attack? That would be a terrible idea, giving up robustness to try to spread adoption to people who clearly aren't interested to begin with.
If you go down that road, eventually the system will stop working and no one will be able to be their own newspaper anymore, even the ones who really wanted that.
I am more hopeful for bitcoin as a unit of account, since it's worldwide it could see widespread acceptance. But what most people will actually use are centralized, reversible payments of fractionally reserved bitcoin promises.  A completely watered down version of the real thing. And they'll be totally happy with it. And we'll be totally happy with our real bitcoin. Just like gold bugs are happy to physically possess gold while most people are happy with paper gold.

Yeah, the problem is that if it relied on public key identity, that would guarantee that no one would use it.
Normal people just can't be bothered. They either get encryption absolutely free (meaning there is zero extra effort involved to use it), or they're out. 
By using phone numbers, the user has already completed the effort (they've created an address book entry mapping a phone number to a name). Someday, perhaps decades from now, there will be no more "phone numbers", but only public keys, and this problem will go away.

For small amounts, the same reason that your actual wallet is always in your pocket and always accessible.
With a hardware wallet you can do both, but honestly, the security of a trezor is kind of overkill for small amounts.

When you do cash-in-person trades, check the security features of the bills. Randomly select some, don't just check the ones on top. Just because you've traded with someone before, doesn't mean you can skip the check.

If anyone takes offense to you checking for counterfeit, you should just walk away.

I find this line of questioning misleading.
Imagine bitcoin goes to $10,000, and you're still holding. Your friends and family are impressed with your gains, and they say "wow, you're really lucky to buy something so cheap and have it increase 1000 fold." But it's not luck. At $1000, you knew you were sitting on massive profit already. Why didn't you sell then? Because you knew it was going to $10,000. Anybody can make 2x or even 5x profit on bitcoin. It's the people who really understand it that can make 1000x.
So of course in retrospect, people who sold at 5x are kicking themselves, but they really didn't have the knowledge to continue to hold. Selling was the right choice for them at the time.

There is always the option to start orphaning the dissenters' blocks.
Personally, I'm betting that this is how segwit will end up being activated. The majority of miners will see that it won't activate, and form a coalition. They'll send a message to the dissenters' pool operators, saying "if you don't start voting for segwit, we will orphan your blocks and you'll lose all revenue. As a show of faith here is a segwit-only transaction signed by us, sending you X btc, you can claim it when segwit activates."
Shortly thereafter you'll see some very serious rhetorical backpedaling by people like Roger Ver on and a while after that, they'll start voting for segwit.

It's not that simple, gox's 1242 was clearly fraudulent, since they were almost certainly insolvent at the time. Unfortunately the fraud impacted prices at other exchanges too.

@_date: 2016-11-18 12:19:31
The only way I can think of to solve something like that would be to have transactions be able to specify a block hash that must be in its ancestry for it to be valid. Then you could broadcast a tx with a recent block hash from forkA, and know that it cannot be valid on forkB. Unless of course, forkB removed that check, but I see no reason why they'd do that.
That would involve new opcodes, and it would probably be an expensive operation and have implementation issues, etc but seems plausible in theory.
Edit: that doesn't totally solve everything - because time-locked transactions that were built before the fork could still be replayed on either fork (they can't possibly know a unique ancestor when the fork hasn't occurred yet). Maybe some kind of replace-by-fee would work.

I don't think it's quite that simple. Imagine if there was no block reward, and LN was able to cache so many transactions that demand for block space didn't even reach the 1mb/block limit. Then miners would just have to accept whatever fees were given. On the other hand, without LN, users have no choice but to compete for block space (as there's no alternative).
That's a simplified example, of course. In reality blocks will probably still be full, but less overall competition for the space therein.
Personally I think you're right, at least, for the near future. The block reward still dominates, so increasing bitcoin's value is still very profitable for miners.

If you account for the fact that some coins were lost early on, we've definitely breached the ATH market cap.
If you assume only 1m coins lost from 2009-2012, the market cap peak in 2013 was only $13.0B. And of course those coins would still be lost today, making the market cap $13.1B at today's peak of $874.
In reality I think it's quite reasonable to assume more than 1m coins are loss (risk adjusted). Vinny Lingham came up with 2.5m but of course it's anyone's guess.
I think if you're trying to give a fair value to bitcoin as a whole, we've hit the ATH. It's hard to know exactly *when* that happened, and of course the media is not going to report "All Time High" until we breach the mtgox price of $1242.

Ok, a targeted attack against someone who is either unaware of the backdoor or unable to counter it, sure.
To activate the backdoor, somehow the attackers have to match your name to some unique hardware id. Possible, but not easy (especially if you bought the laptop used). Then they have to communicate with the laptop somehow. It needs to receive an inbound packet (also not easy if it's behind a firewall). We already agreed it's not polling because then *every* laptop would have to do it and intel would get caught.
These would have to be pretty high-value targets, and even then it's not that difficult to bypass (buy a laptop for cash on craigslist).

I think though, that it's disingenuous to say that bitcoin is a "medium of exchange" without qualification. Sure, right now pretty much anyone who wants to accept it, can accept it. Just like they could accept dollars in cash. However, **if** many more people tried to start accepting it, they could not, without some kind of additional scaling solution.

Not only that, but it's self-destabilizing. Many people do not want to hold bitcoin because they're afraid of it quickly losing value.

That's what strikes me as "tinfoil hatty" about all these claims that hardware backdoors are exfiltrating data from our PCs and mobiles.
For example, you'll find claims that modern phones are still "on" even when they appear to be "off". Well, shouldn't that be easy to prove? Computing requires power. It should be relatively easy for a researcher to show which components are active when the device is supposed to be off.
Same goes for the claims of exfiltrating data. That requires a network connection. It should be easy to figure out where the data is being sent.
In other words, I don't see how intel or anyone else could turn our machines into spying devices without getting caught. Given how quickly users have turned away from services that got caught spying on them, that's a really risky thing for a hardware maker to attempt.

TBH I don't interact much with people under 25, but the 25-35 age group seems to be a lot more accepting of bitcoin as money, than people my age or older.
Example: I met a guy around 70, used to be a forex trader who did massive volumes of trading. I asked him about how it worked, what he based his trades on etc. I mentioned I dabbled in crypto trading just for fun but investment-wise I just bought and held bitcoin. He said "eh, I've heard of it, but I can't hold it in my hand so I'm not interested". I replied "that's the advantage of it, you can hold it in your mind, cross a border with it and no one even knows you have it". I hope that sparked some interest in him, but I doubt it. 
I'm sure you're right that with the younger folks, their problem isn't with the tech, its that they haven't been screwed by the traditional system enough yet to want an alternative.

It is the logical thing to do right now, but eventually, as this practice grows, it will become less and less useful. Difficulty will rise because tons of free power is being poured into mining. 
Put another way, even if all the excess power in the world were suddenly diverted to bitcoin mining tomorrow, the amount of bitcoin mined each day remains the same [edit - after the difficulty adjustment, of course]. So everyone doing this would get a much smaller share.

This is not true!
A phishing site CANNOT steal your funds. If you do go to it, and it asks you to install hacked firmware, that resets your device so it doesn't have the keys anymore (you need to recover from seed), and it warns you you're running unsigned firmware every time it starts.
If you ignore those massive blaring sirens and lose funds, that's 100% your fault. Sometimes the security fault lies in the user.

3) Where did you buy the device?
4) Were you using a passphrase and/or PIN? If so, were they written down or memorized?

Not for me. If fees are $5 then I would be absolutely thrilled to pay it, because I'd be sending my stash to an exchange and it would be worth many many times what it's worth now. Just think about how valuable bitcoin would have to be if 3 people per second were paying $5 to use it.

People are going to get out of the stock market, there is no reason whatsoever currently, that they wouldn't flee to dollars for the foreseeable future. This is neutral with respect to bitcoin price (value that's already elsewhere, staying elsewhere).
However that could change if things get worse - deeply negative interest rates, inflation etc. Then bitcoin will look really attractive: easy to buy and protect (compared to gold, real estate), bigger upside.
I don't think it takes that much to overcome people's perceptions of bitcoin as "speculative".

Bitcoin competes very favorably with literally anything that is used as a store of value (to the degree that it's used as a SoV). Land unquestionably is serving in part as SoV (nearly everyone expects their home to increase in value long term, even though none of them want a 50 year old home).
Bitcoin's potential marketcap is in the hundreds of trillions. I expect it to make obsolete as a SoV: Art, diamonds, precious metals, land, fiat currency, and all financial instruments.
When you look at the potential, and how very little is standing in bitcoin's way, the price of $7900 is laughably cheap. The only explanation I have is that people just can't believe it, it's too huge for them to accept, they assume there must be some horrible catch. There isn't.

An attacker would need either the seed or the device. I believe it is **highly** likely that someone got possession of one of them at some point, likely a short time (hours to days) before the transaction occurred.
There are other unlikely ways to attack, like fake devices, but these are relatively rare.
If you have a roommate or anyone else who might have been near where you keep your written seed, they are the prime suspects at this point. If you don't have a PIN on your device, then the same goes for anyone who might have been near the device.
If you have a **password** (which I'd be willing to bet you don't), then it's a whole different story.

A few comments:
* You do NOT have a passphrase, so anyone who's ever seen your seed can take your coins. We should focus on that. The chances that the firmware update had anything to do with this are small, we can look at that after eliminating other more likely issues.
* It sounds like you had a lot of coins coming in and then sent out soon after. It might be that your seed was compromised years ago and the attacker was just waiting for coins to arrive, but wasn't sophisticated enough to automate it.

I'm over 40 too, understand bitcoin perfectly well.
However even I have to admit, the younger folks are much more interested in learning about new technologies. The downside is they're a lot easier to sucker into tech scams, precisely because they are slow to dismiss new things. People who lost their ass on alts I'm sure were overwhelmingly young.
That's just the way things are - experimenting with new tech that could easily be a waste of time, is generally a young person's game. They have the disposable time to sink into it. That's why older people's eyes glaze over, they've heard about a million new exciting technologies that never amounted to anything, and can't be bothered to pursue the latest hotness. Once it gets established, they get on board, just like with cellphones, facebook etc.
That's the behavior I see now from nearly everyone over 40. Pure dismissal of bitcoin. Not for any reason, they don't know exactly why they think it's a scam, they just can't be bothered to put in the time and effort to figure it out. If they did it for bitcoin, they'd have to do it for everything. And quite frankly I can't blame them. Well, unless they're in finance, or even worse, economists.

You're talking about rubber hose cryptanalysis.
That's not seizing your bitcoin, which means taking it without your permission. That's torturing you until they get your permission.
That's so far from "seizure" it's ridiculous to compare the two. A government can seize however much they want from however many bank account holders they want, with basically the push of a button. They don't have to enlist police to physically round up and torture every single account holder! And deal with the terrible optics that would come with that.
Taking people's money looks bad. Torturing them and then taking their money looks a hell of a lot worse.
Sure, totalitarian governments would do either one, but going down the latter path would significantly shorten their reign.

There are huge differences between land and bitcoin.
* Land is not even remotely fungible - there's massive difference in value between land in the middle of a desert and beachfront near a major city.
* At least one major use of land (residences) is subject to significant efficiency gains (by building taller buildings, which makes more residential area on the same land. Practically, this makes land's "flow" positive.


How is that "psychological" in any way that doesn't apply to literally everything? All value is subjective. Seems pretty clear to me why beachfront property costs a lot - it's pretty, mild weather, and generally lots of outdoorsy stuff to do, and the supply is extremely limited. It makes sense that hurricane risk doesn't really deter anyone.

Makes sense. While there are people for whom there's an obvious reason to *sell* futures (miners), there's no legit reason to buy them, unless they're at a discount.
Think about it - why would you want to have 'your keys, your coins' later, when you can have it now for the same price?
I know people will say "people don't want custody", but not wanting custody is just plain stupid and defeats the entire purpose of bitcoin. Bitcoin costs virtually nothing to secure, and the counterparty risk cost starts to outweigh the self-custody cost at fairly low amounts. 
I look at futures prices on bitmex for example, and have lately seen premiums of 2-3%. Who in their right mind would pay 3% more to get bitcoin later vs getting it now?

Ah ok I was on mobile and didn't read carefully. That makes a bit more sense since accelerometers need way less power than a gps receiver (afaik). That's not particularly useful for spying though. You might be able to tell that a person is walking or sitting etc, but not their location, or what they're saying.
Also, if the iphone does this, it should be easy to prove. Remove the case, drain the battery until ios shuts down the phone, then put a probe on the accelerometer chip.

Yes, I think it's harmful to bitcoin to force it on people who are not interested, particularly on people you have power over (your employees) who will be uncomfortable doing anything but playing along. Gifts are supposed to be for the recipient, not to further the interests of the giver.
OP should say "you can get your holiday bonus as direct deposit, amazon gift card, or bitcoin". If anyone asks about the bitcoin option, **then** they are showing interest and OP can explain what it's all about.

For the specific case you're talking about, you'd probably have them commit to a hash of their bid, so nobody would know what it is. Then when the auction is over they reveal their bids and it's then proven who won.
But generally, there is no such thing as a time-lock in crypto, since math doesn't know what time it is (that's a human construct). The only way to withhold the info over time is to trust someone to keep the secret until the appointed time.
You could always rely on brute forcing a key to slow down access to a secret, but the problem there is you can't predict how long it'll take with any accuracy.

Of course! You borrow bitcoin and sell it, then later pay it back. Leverage is just part of the terms of borrowing. Let's say you have $7,000 as collateral and you want to borrow 10 btc. Someone could loan you the 10btc so you can immediately sell it, but if the price goes up 10%, they'll take your collateral and close your position. That's pretty much how bitmex works, but it's bitcoin-only.

The change in new supply has no effect on the cost to transfer. They are part of the same process though: the mining work is done "on" the transactions in the block (the work cannot be reused for anything, it's only good for that exact block). And once a valid block is found, the miner who found it can claim the new coins.
The cost to transfer is entirely driven by the block size limit (roughly 1.3mb, somewhere around 200 tx per minute), and the demand for transfers.
What's important about bitcoin is that it has zero supply elasticity. That means, no matter how expensive bitcoin gets, it cannot be produced any faster than before. Gold is not like that - if the price goes up, mining production increases. Bitcoin can ONLY respond to higher demand with higher price. Increasing the supply is not an option, and that's what makes it an incredible savings vehicle.

It's not about the tech, although it does need to be sound and it is.
Think about this: bitcoin's price going up does not result in it being produced any faster. That's unlike any money or commodity that ever existed.
It is the absolute soundest money that can ever exist - its supply elasticity is zero. Add to that all the tech stuff (you can teleport it anywhere, impossible to counterfeit, programmable etc). It's demonstrably superior to any store of value in existence.
Does everyone get it yet? Of course not. But it's inevitable that they will. Bitcoin is a black hole and nothing can escape its gravity. Sure, stuff can orbit far away for a long time, but anything that gets close will be sucked in and will never escape. I believe it's destined to suck in nearly all stores of value (to the extent they're used as SoV): gold, savings accounts, real estate, art, diamonds, stocks, bonds. Hundred trillion dollars at minimum.
The only bearish argument is: despite being so clearly superior, for whatever reason nobody will care. That's just silly - why wouldn't they care? People like to make money. There's no precedent for anything like that happening - some revolutionary clear leap above previous solutions, that people willfully ignored? Doesn't happen.

Nobody has to wait. You mean they'll complain about the cost of having quick confirmation. I'm perfectly happy for them to go elsewhere. Bitcoin should be as secure as possible. If someone wants to build a lower security system, that's great, I might use it. But it's not bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-11-14 13:20:47
I think the predictability of the supply is more important than whether it slowly inflates or slowly deflates. At some point we won't even know if it's slowly inflating or slowly deflating - bitcoins get lost at some unknown and unsteady rate. As the inflation slows, the loss rate will overtake the inflation, but we won't know when.

It's not the same, there's no regulations preventing other companies from selling hardware wallets. The trezor folks know you can just buy a ledger nano instead, they are betting their product is still desirable enough at $119 that people will still be happy with that. They're probably right.

When you consider that a significant number of coins were lost early on in bitcoin's history, we're even closer to the market cap ATH. If you assume 2.5m coins have been lost (Vinny Lingham's estimate), then we're at about 97% of the ATH, instead of 91% (if you assume no coins are lost).

I don't know, as I don't know you or your home or your habits. However you should think about this carefully if you want to get to the bottom of it.
I don't think this was sophisticated malware, if it was, it would have stolen the entire 5.63 btc the instant you received it.
This appears to be a manual action which suggests someone who's not a bitcoin expert, only someone who can use wallet software. Someone either knew your seed, or had access to the device and PIN. 
It's someone who was either checking fairly often, or knew you'd be receiving the coins. The firmware update is a red herring, esp if your wallet was essentially empty until right after the update.
@_date: 2019-10-24 15:59:32


This is where you're wrong. The number one reason to care about bitcoin is that it's the scarcest possible thing that can ever exist. It is the soundest money that could even theoretically exist, and it's here, and it has all the cool tech properties of money too.
I think what you mean is most people have no idea what money is and why scarcity matters. That's true! But most people are also dirt poor and irrelevant to the price of bitcoin. People who have acquired wealth understand money and scarcity much better, and they're precisely the ones looking for a good way to store value.

Is the reverse true? "Bitcoin's supply will be decreased, and any sane person would agree to it".
Let's say there is a fork, which changes halvings to every 2 years instead of every 4 (which would reduce the amount of bitcoin remaining to be mined by 1/2, obliterating ~1.5 million future coins). 
Would you vote for it? On the one hand, it makes your coins more scarce, which is good. On the other hand, it would force the network to stop relying on the block subsidy earlier. Also, any change to the supply could be viewed as a bad precedent, even if it benefits everyone who holds it.

This is basically a list of every misconception in the ETH community. It sounds just like banks who are excited about their private blockchain, despite having no in depth understanding of what problem they're trying to solve. They don't know whether their proposed solution actually solves anything, or just sounds really cool.
Ethereum has had years to solve problems, and all they've done is create more.
Bitcoin at least does what it says (unseizable commodity with strictly limited supply) and solves the problem of soft money issued by central banks. It hasn't been adopted yet, but it is at least a solution. 
I don't know what problem ethereum has solved, even accounting for lack of adoption. Were we suffering from a severe lack of shitcoins?

Bitcoin is in a speculative phase where it's appreciating rapidly. It's no surprise that people are not particularly interested in spending something that could be worth 10x more in a year. Eventually everyone will have bought bitcoin, the speculative phase will be nearly over, and the chances of further rapid appreciation will be very low. *Then* people will start spending it.

I don't know about 'inevitable', but if bitcoin keeps thriving, we're going to hit the inflection point of that s-curve either on the next wave, or the following. That would be the point where fiat losing value as a direct result of flight to bitcoin starts to be measurable. Worldwide M2 is about $90T. If 1% is measurable, bitcoin would need to hit $900b, which would correspond to about $50,000 per coin, which is a mere 2.5x the previous peak.

Your mother having a totally inaccurate view of how hw wallets work, says nothing about how they actually work.
She buys a trezor, plugs it in, writes the seed on a piece of paper. She chooses a PIN. Then drives over to her bank and places the piece of paper in a safe deposit box. This is less time and work than opening a bank account.
Please explain how this is less secure than depositing her money at the bank.
* She can forget her PIN! Nope. Recover from the seed backup, set new PIN.
* She can forget her password! Nope. She isn't using one.
* Someone could steal her Trezor! Nope. They don't know the PIN, and it has exponentially increasing delays to prevent brute force.
* She could lose her Trezor! Nope. Order a new one and recover the seed the same as the first bullet point. (or recover the seed with a software wallet like electrum, which she would already have installed)
HW wallets are secure and easy to use.

The only core property of bitcoin is that its properties are whatever you say they are.
You can argue about what changes people would or wouldn't like, but you really don't know. There's always a fundamental tradeoff between having all of your personal rule preferences, and the liquidity of the coin that results. If you make it exactly how you like, few others will agree and you'll have a low-value coin. If you just do whatever the crowd wants, you may end up with stupid rules that hurt the coin's value.

It's not either/or, it's one and then the other. Currently we are in a speculation phase.

It would not be so important to begin farming or building on it immediately. 
I don't see what is so difficult to understand.

You're assuming NYA signalers are going to actually do what they are signaling. There's no reason whatsoever to believe that.
And you're further assuming that if they DO follow through, that bitcoin will need some sort of cheat to survive. It won't. Hodlers can just continue to hodl, while miners either give up or bleed to death.
Those who are primarily interested in "cheap/fast transactions" are leaving eventually no matter what. Let them leave now. We'll be fine.
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:00:41


I don't think that's true. My understanding was that you can generate public keys directly from private keys. If you have the private key you should be able to generate the public key and then the address from the public key.
That's how a brute force search would work: start with private key 0, derive public key, derive address. Is it an address with a balance? If so, sweep. The increment the private key to 1 and try again.
It's still a search of 2^256 space, which is more than large enough that you'd never find even a single valid key, even with all the energy in the universe, and the most efficient computer that physics allows.
So the fact that you can derive pubkeys from private keys doesn't hurt security.

Huh? I wasn't suggesting it be run on the trezor. You run it on a computer, get the derived password, type it in. Then if someone steals the trezor, the password is too difficult to brute force.

I'm not sure I agree. While some people prefer someone else to hold their coins, it's kind of antithetical to bitcoin's entire purpose.
For example: take gold. Most of what's traded is just pieces of paper that are completely irredeemable for actual gold (as there's perhaps hundreds of times more promises to pay gold, than there is actual gold on earth). I don't know who in their right mind calls this "stable". It will eventually collapse, with tremendous losses to everyone holding that instrument.
Bitcoin ETF is equivalent to paper gold, or at least, it's the first step down that road.

I think the stress tests weren't long enough to cause the problems Gavin was worried about. He's talking about where fees just keep increasing and it has no effect on the backlog, until people are actually priced out of the market or quit in frustration because fee requirements are unpredictable.

The urgency is having a fix coded, tested and ready. Those things take time, that we cannot afford to take when bitcoin is already bleeding users.

This whole debate is silly.
Deliberate forks should be on an entirely new network. They should just copy the existing bitcoin ledger, and change to a new set of seed nodes and a different network port.
There's a big difference between "I am forking - let's fight to the death" and "I am forking, see you later, good luck".
Any contentious issue like block size should be implemented as a "fork coin". Basically an alt, but copying bitcoin's legitimate ledger instead of starting with a fresh (scammy) one.

These are all "demand". The equation still holds - if the price is steady then the demand increased.

This is not 100% myth, there is some truth to this. There have been thousands of crimes where the proceeds moved on the blockchain, and that hasn't helped identify the criminal at all. 
To trace bitcoin to a real-world identity, you have to do a lot of detective work. You have to identify the owner of some related address. Usually you have no idea who owns any of the related addresses until you get several hops away. And then you have to hope that person (or company) is willing to divulge what it knows. And then hope the next hop back will also divulge, until you get the identity of the target.
In real life this detective work is simply not done. It could be done in theory but in practice it is very difficult.

Exactly, which is why I think all the handwringing over "centralization" is bullshit.
Mining centralization is a potential problem whether you have 1mb block limit or not. The only force I can think of that can oppose this is heat dissipation, (where individual users can use 100% of the heat from their ASIC, but a huge mining farm cannot). That will not come into play until ASICS stop improving at such a fast rate.

That isn't even remotely a possibility. Markets don't just stop like that. People will be trading.
There will be people on both sides who will dump at market price. Which chain comes out on top just depends on who wants what more.
Nobody here is going to "do nothing" unconditionally. If the prices of bitcoin or 2x are wildly high (or low) then people will sell (or buy) regardless of their fork stance.
Example: Let's say after the fork, bitcoin is at $100,000 and 2x is at $0.01. Would you not trade a tiny fraction of a bitcoin for a large share of 2x "just in case"? You'd be a fool not to.
Everyone wants to support the cause, but only up to a point. Nobody's going to dump 2x for $0.01, it just doesn't make sense to do so.


Totally agree with you there. I see no scenario where the original chain doesn't survive. To be honest I'm hoping that bitcoin gets severely attacked and it scares off all the weak hands who never cared about censorship resistance. I'll be there, ready to vastly increase my holdings.
Probably won't happen though, lots of people like me are ready to do the same.

Normally this is abstracted away with software repositories whose signing keys are either distributed with the OS or the user can add later.
None of this solves the problem of knowing who to trust in the first place. If you've only heard "you should download electrum", you can't be sure electrum.org is the right domain.
One solution that could eventually be employed: When starting a project, do a "proof of existence" of your key (say, in the blockchain). Then anyone looking for your software could distinguish you from imitators by looking for the oldest proof of existence. That assumes of course, that no one would be interested in attacking you *before* they knew of you or your project. Generally that holds true.

It still is. Except instead of running a CPU yourself you can rent CPU time on someone else's machine. It's called a "mining fee".
Satoshi knew the early block rewards would swamp this fee and make mining profitable whether miners included transactions or not. That's just the tradeoff that was made to encourage adoption and distribute the coins.
There's no way out of it, regardless of what happens with the block size.

I'm sorry but you're biased because you've already learned about banking so you forget what you had to learn. It's at least as much as with bitcoin.
You don't need to know anything about bitcoin addresses if you already know what bank account numbers are. You pretty much just need to know a) the secret key is what is needed to spend bitcoin, so anyone that sees it can spend your bitcoin. b) If you want your payment to go through faster, you need to pay a higher fee. c) payments are irreversible so make sure you've got the right destination before you send.

Maybe on bitmex, but didn't futures in general start off to serve commodities like corn, where it takes time to produce and then rots? Bitcoin just doesn't fit this need very well, so maybe the leverage is the only reason futures are in use.
Bitcoin for the most part isn't produced at all (yes it's mined but mining is tapering off pretty quick, soon nearly everything will be existing stock). And bitcoin doesn't rot at all, so there's not much reason to want delivery later vs now.
Edit: it's possible to have a spot market with leverage, so I don't really understand why the market is so fond of futures.

Bitlicense is sort of like the government of say, Japan, passing a law that no one can email anyone in Japan.

This is not necessarily true. Bitcoin is specifically a censorship resistant digital currency. You have to consider the future of that separately.
Personally I think bitcoin and the underground economy will have a symbiotic relationship and both will grow. Will it destroy the "above ground" economy? I very much doubt it. If no one's trying to stop you, why would you go underground?
The bitcoin ledger isn't going anywhere. It may fork many times, but the fork point is in the future, not the past. There's no legitimate reason at this point not to bootstrap a new ledger technology with the current state of the bitcoin ledger. It was a fair start and there probably can't be another one.

Yes, ideally you want to maximize miner revenue. The problem is you can't really even measure that. If you just look at the fees included in the block, that doesn't tell you anything that can't be trivially gamed. A miner can make revenue look larger by including his own money as fees in a block (that he receives right back again). He can also make revenue look smaller by taking payment out-of-band to include txs in a block.
But all this is beside the original point - which is, just because revenue hasn't been maximized, doesn't mean the system is failing.

Of course there would be absolutely massive panic.
Yes, the coins would be instantly swept, but every bitcoin holder in existence would be sending his coins to an exchange in order to dump before whoever got satoshi's coins could dump them. If there was really 1m+ coins changing hands (and there's reason to doubt satoshi had that many), the price would fall probably to double digits, maybe lower.
Make no mistake, it would be complete pandemonium. Of course, it would also be a fantastic one-time-only sale, and eventually the price would recover.

Right, you do have to decide what price range to spend the bulk of your fiat. If it keeps dipping even lower, you'll only have a small amount left. But you STILL shouldn't spend it all.
Buying dips in the bear market is a bad idea. It works much better during the bull run. My strategy was to take the proceeds of what I sold during the last bull run, assume the bear market would be similar to previous ones, and buy somewhat above that range just to be safe. That put the bulk of my buys in the 4-6k range. But I still have about 10% of my fiat left. I may DCA most of that in over the next year and also set some lowball orders in case of flash crash.

Yeah attacking a chain with 1/1000th the power is pretty trivial and costs very little.
But attacking a chain with 1/10th the power is costly and it's not very likely to be successful. The reason new alts got obliterated is because they started with zero hash power.
That wouldn't happen in the case of a bitcoin fork - if it had even modest support it would probably not get attacked.

Did you know you can mutate your local copy of the blockchain? It's on a writable disk! Does that make it any less immutable in the sense that it becomes invalid to everyone else the moment you mess with it?

I'm not so sure it's unnecessary. 
Let's say I fork to make block sizes unlimited and my miners immediately start producing 20gb blocks. What prevents "traditional" nodes from having these huge blocks relayed to them? 
Those nodes don't want to see 20gb blocks, they don't want to even connect to my node at all because that's all it's going to give them. So why even pretend to be the same network?

@_date: 2017-11-09 17:58:56
I totally agree. Don't forget it's also an unseizable asset, which basically didn't exist before.
Also, 2x'ers argue that doubling the block size doesn't ruin the censorship resistant properties. That's true as far as it goes, but the problem is you still can't use bitcoin for coffee with 2mb blocks either. It doesn't solve any problem, it just kicks the can down the wrong road.
Scaling is not solved by block size increases. It's a hard problem and it will take time. Meanwhile bitcoin has some amazing properties that I think more than justifies its current price.
Edit: i'm actually impressed that the market rejected 2x. This is not an easy concept to understand. That means there are a lot of sophisticated users with deep pockets.
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:04:17
Yeah but the risk is that everyone has piled in for their fork bonus, and when the smart money takes their profit, everyone else will panic.
To me, the odds that this will happen outweigh the potential gain. Sure I could try to get out ahead of everyone else immediately after the fork, but I suspect there will be utter chaos. Slow blocks, trading engines buckling under the heavy volume, etc. I think it may be better to just get out of the way until the smoke starts to clear.
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:50:33
There would have still been a problem even with a million independent miners all mining the most profitable chain.
The issue really wasn't the miners. It was BCH buyers who were ok with bribing bitcoin miners at the expense of inflating their currency a bit. They all collectively paid the bribe, and any profit-maximizing miner would have taken it.
Imagine a new fork where the block reward is raised to a million BTC per block. You would never buy that fork because the supply would be increasing so fast (into the hands of miners) that the value would soon plummet. But let's say a lot of stupid people DID buy that fork. That would spell trouble for bitcoin because all the miners would switch to that fork to take the stupid people's money. 
A less severe version of that is BCH.
So what can we do to protect bitcoin from this sort of thing? In my opinion, nothing. You just have to wait out the stupid people to lose their money. Changing PoW doesn't help because someone can then just create a new fork with the new PoW algorithm.
In the case of BCH, it was a few days of higher fees. Personally my reaction is "who cares". I know a lot of people got bent out of shape over it, but these are tiny players in the market (some high school kid with $100 worth who is mad that he has to pay a $10 fee to buy a video game that he has to have RIGHT NOW and not in a few days).

If you have a coinbase account, you have access to gdax already. You can buy as much as you want. There are limits on withdrawal, but it's been pretty easy to get those limits raised. You just go to the settings and request higher limit. I've had mine approved within minutes.

I'm not an economist, but I believe that doesn't happen with a limited supply money like bitcoin. When the economy shrinks, the value of bitcoin will stop growing and people will diversify into other investments.
Bitcoin stabilizes an economy - prevents it from growing too fast (bitcoin becomes the most attractive investment). Also prevents it from shrinking too fast (it starts to lose value and people invest elsewhere).

I don't know who's claiming that majority vote has any sway whatsoever. 
Nobody can make you change the rules of your own node. They can only lure away other users so that your consensus is smaller. As long as you're ok with the number of users that remain, then you will have nothing to worry about. The "majority" can "vote" all they like, they cannot force your node to accept what it considers invalid transactions (for example, 1000 BTC block reward).
@_date: 2015-08-04 14:32:23
This is rather dangerous. You can't have the value of electricity being burned for proof of work become totally disconnected from the value of the transactions that the blockchain is putting in order.
What if billion dollar transactions were regularly being added to the blockchain? Then it would become trivially cheap to rent mining power (or put another way, bribe miners) to pull off double spends.
One might argue that because the parties are all known to each other and subject to prosecution if they double spend, this won't happen.
Well, if that's the case, you do not need proof of work. You just need hashes and digital signatures.
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:13:09
I don't think so. The wallet would have to have some limit on fees it's willing to pay, which I suppose would be a sane default relative to the size of the input, and overrideable by the user in a settings panel.
If fees are sky high in a LN environment, that means that new LN users are competing for on-chain capacity, which in a way is a good problem to have. In that case, the users needing the highest transaction throughput would get in first (they'd be willing to pay more to open a channel because they'll save more on fees by using more LN txs).
Clearly the whole world can't join LN when blocks are only 1.7 mb. However that simply isn't going to happen anytime soon even if the capacity were unlimited. Most of the world still thinks bitcoin is either a ponzi scheme or just for criminals. That kind of cultural change may happen quickly by historical standards, but it still takes years. By that time, I would expect hardware improvements to make larger block sizes uncontroversial. (I don't think they're controversial now, it's just that segwit is still new and we haven't seen its effects yet, so a bit early to be pushing for more).

If you don't mind letting coinbase hold both the coins you intend to sell, and the ones you intend to keep, then yes. You'll get to trade earlier than those who deposit after the fork.
As for fees, who knows. Depends on what happens with the fork. Since you have two weeks left, you can send it to coinbase with a low fee and it'll get there eventually.

Probably not. There is counterparty risk leaving it on an exchange, but depending on the exchange it's probably not a 10% risk (which is what you'd lose buying a trezor).
You need a safe place to back up your seed if you get a trezor. If you have such a place, you may want to just use a regular software wallet like Electrum. Back up the seed onto a piece of paper, store it away safe. Withdraw from the exchange into that wallet, and then perhaps erase the wallet from your computer (leaving the seed backup as the only access to your bitcoin).
This means you control your money, but also ... you control your money and if you screw up by losing the seed, it's gone.
@_date: 2019-02-11 14:23:09
Lesson is, never go 100% into, or out of, bitcoin.
No matter how low the price goes, it could go lower. Having some dry powder lets you take advantage. Same in the opposite direction. 
Fwiw, you will not regret buying at 6k a few years from now. 12k, perhaps. Nobody can reliably buy at the absolute bottom. The game is to accumulate as much as possible. Have to balance the risk of overpaying with the risk of missing the train. Missing the train is arguably worse.
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:34:31
It's not and never will be.
Look, some people only care about fast/cheap transactions and censorship resistance is either an afterthought or they don't care at all. These are simply not bitcoin users. They're just here out of convenience. Eventually some centralized clearinghouse will be faster and cheaper than any cryptocurrency and that'll be the end of bitcoin from their perspective.
Just let those people exit now.
There's plenty of people who care about bitcoin as an unseizable asset. Those people could not give less of a shit if there's a temporary attack on their chain. They're holding an unseizable asset, not buying socks or skittles or whatever trivial bullshit all the time. They will not care if they can't transact for a month without paying a large fee. These are the people who will be buying the bitcoin that the aforementioned users will be panic selling.
I expect 2x to remain lower value than bitcoin, and miners will have to return to bitcoin, or bleed to death. Meanwhile holders will just sit tight and not lose a single satoshi.

It should also be noted at that fork point, there will be two currencies with a shared history. Each person holding bitcoin at that point will be able to spend them twice (once on each fork). Therefore this is absolutely going to decrease the price of at least one of the forks, so that the total value of both of them is roughly equivalent to the value of bitcoin before the fork.

You have to understand that the ecosystem is not under your control, and I don't even see why this should bother you.
Is bitcoin core vulnerable to hostile forks? Patch it to be more resistant.
Are you worried that miners will be tricked into supporting a chain that isn't actually secure? 
You must see the parallels between bitcoin/bitcoinXT and bitcoin/fiat? Fiat currencies normally work pretty well from an end-user perspective, but they can fail catastrophically. Most people just don't give a shit, but when catastrophe comes, bitcoin will be there for them. If you're not worried about the vast majority of humans on earth sticking with fiat for now, you shouldn't be worried about them switching to XT.
The only real concern I can see is that the original chain could be left totally dysfunctional due to the very long difficulty reset period. I would argue that this is a serious flaw in bitcoin that could be fixed. Miners (mostly) abandoning a chain should only make it less secure, not totally dysfunctional.

Yes, there's a faction who wants cheap and fast payments who are simply barking up the wrong tree.
That's not what bitcoin is, and it never can be. A central database will always be cheaper and faster. The best bitcoin can do is be as cheap as it can be without sacrificing its use as unseizable money, and force the central database competitors to be cheaper and faster to make up for their censorship.

If that's the most effective way of exfiltrating data from my machine, I'd be pretty happy. 
Of course, targets that are much higher value than me would probably still need to be concerned about that method.
I'd be much more concerned if data was being exfiltrated via wifi and those packets hidden from the OS. Sure, a router could notice the packets, if it wasn't also backdoored. Which is why I suspect such a method would not be commonly used, it'd get noticed pretty quickly.

It really goes to show how some of the core developers simply do not get it.
They may be right about Bitcoin XT having terrible flaws and bad things will happen. It should not matter because bad things only affect those who chose that path. It's their choice. In reality maybe XT imploding would damage bitcoin core nodes as well. That is a problem with bitcoin that should be addressed.
Bitcoin should be inherently forkable. One major problem that currently interferes with this, is the long mining difficulty reset period. If your fork has 90% of its miners leave, then it might take almost 2 months for the next reset, and until then you only get a block every 100 minutes. This is a serious problem. There's probably a better way to do difficulty adjustments.

The majority, certainly, but not "everybody". You're right that "of course the government insists on being paid in dollars" - because they want to create demand for the currency that it costs them nothing to produce. It doesn't necessarily have to be so, just because it's always been.


This is a common misconception. It's not true. No one can force you to accept a change to the 21 million bitcoin limit, ever. Your node says what's valid to you, and you decide what software you want to run. What *can* happen is that everyone else abandons the limit, and you have very few people left to transact with. But you still have a choice. You are never forced to abandon the limit.

The issue of offline/online is not unique to bitcoin.
You have dollar banknotes and they can be counterfeited. Bitcoin "notes" already exist too, and serve the same purpose (offline cash), but of course they can also be counterfeited.
At least with bitcoin, if the coin is real then you know the supply cannot be illegally inflated by the issuer. With dollars, you don't have that guarantee.

The BCH inflation is ahead of schedule. It's like 10,000 blocks ahead of where it should have been, 125,000 bch's created before their time.
That extra inflation is a tax on bch holders. Everyone knew the EDA was broken and would result in inflation, so basically everyone who held BCH was a willing participant.
Those extra 125,000 bchs were a reward (bribe) to miners, willingly paid by BCH buyers.

That may be their conclusion but what would it be based on?
This is the only study of bitcoin distribution I've seen: 
You have to figure practical users are not willing to pay more than a few percent of their stash for a hardware wallet. Say 2%.
If you graph the above distribution, you'd have to come up with the exponent you'd get in users from halving the price. Obviously, the higher the bitcoin price, the more benefit there is to dropping the price of the trezor.  So the price decline in the last year has made their price more realistic, but that doesn't justify their original decision.

I would think a well-designed LN wallet could operate completely automatically, creating channels as needed without any interaction from the user. However some input from the user would be helpful, such as whether he is using the wallet like a checking account (where money comes in and goes out, balance remaining roughly the same over long periods of time), or savings/merchant (where money mostly comes in). That would tell the wallet how it should create channels - either as say 50/50 split initially or 20/80 split initially.
There will be some cases when there simply is no route, but I would think that by the time "average joes" are joining that would be so rare as to be negligible.

I hate to be a downer, but the novelty is going to wear off and people are going to discover they're getting a shitty deal spending their BTC this way.
The thing is, there are just WAY too many other places where people are willing to pay a premium for bitcoin.
Example - Amazon gift cards. You can get anywhere from 3 to 20% discount, via gyft, localbitcoins, or purse.io.
So any item that's roughly the same price on Amazon as TigerDirect, well, guess which one actually the better deal? Amazon.
To be honest the real reason for these discounts is that people use gift cards as an easy way to bypass KYC regulations. They get bitcoin and they don't have to give away their passport, first born child, and a stool sample.
These people pay a premium for bitcoin and they're more profitable trade partners than TigerDirect.

This will make no difference.
Let's say coinbase is a hub and requires KYC. Customer Alice wants to buy drugs on the dark net market. Coinbase of course will not route a payment directly to the DNM. Bob is a coinbase customer and DNM customer. Now Alice can route her payment to DNM, from coinbase to Bob to DNM. Coinbase thinks Alice is paying Bob, so from their perspective everything is fine.

I'm worried. The fact that everyone is saying "nah, it's fine, just a normal dip!" is a huge red flag to me. This dip is not "china bans bitcoin" or "bcash fud/spam attack".

In the last year I've probably made a few dozen transactions. Almost entirely for investment and trading purposes. The amount of goods/services I have bought in the last year with bitcoin is zero. Really the only thing I can think of that I would use bitcoin to pay for again is VPN service (where I do not wish to have my account connected easily with my real world identity).
For the most part, it's pointless using bitcoin to pay for everyday goods and services. Why would I make an irreversible payment when the other party accepts reversible ones, and the price is the same either way? It doesn't make any sense at all. If merchants started offering discounts, that would change my mind. But I don't foresee that happening for years. Merchants don't give a shit about bitcoin, so I don't really care to give my bitcoin to them. When they want it bad enough, they'll get it.
Edit: and whose business relies on bitcoin? Newegg? Nope. Overstock? Nope. Expedia? Nope. The businesses that rely on bitcoin would be businesses that need censorship resistance.

Almost nobody cares if their pocket money follows an exact inflation schedule or is censorship resistant.
In the far future, maybe we have lightning network wallets that are dead simple to use (tap to pay). Maybe we have hardware wallets that are dead simple to use. To some degree there will always be a tradeoff between security and ease of use. It's just a matter of how narrow the gap can get, that determines what cross section of the population chooses the secure method.

No, this has been suggested many times, it doesn't work. It's similar to inflation, which bitcoin was designed to defeat.

I think most of their cost is capital cost of hardware and software development, not the marginal cost of each unit.
Still, IMHO satoshi labs has committed a blunder with their pricing.
Let's say they sold 10,000 units at $119 and their marginal cost is $20. That's $990,000 to offset their development costs.
I think if they'd priced it at say $59, they'd have sold 30,000 units, giving them $1,170,000 to offset development costs.
Edit: the reason is, there's lot of people who want to buy a trezor, but don't, because it doesn't make sense to secure a small amount of BTC with such an expensive device. Cutting the price in half can easily more than double the user base, because of the power-law distribution of bitcoin.

What is a "one-off" transaction? You mean you buy some bitcoin and then spend it and never use bitcoin again? LN doesn't help you there.

It's possible, but satoshi reappearing would put all his bitcoins potentially at play too. If he only dumped 2x, it would still tilt the scales in bitcoin's favor.
That would be such an amazing story if that happened, but alas, I think the odds of it are extremely low. Satoshi doesn't want his identity known, and reappearing (esp by creating accounts on exchanges) would put his anonymity at serious risk.

Stopped reading right there. I wouldn't believe anything this article says after seeing this whopper.
Whoever wrote this doesn't seem to realize money is fungible, and that this is a perfectly normal practice that ALL cryptocurrency exchanges have.
Exchanges have hot and cold wallets. The cold wallet is very high security and rarely accessed. The hot wallet holds much less funds, but is easily accessible to withdraw from. When someone needs to withdraw, it doesn't matter how long ago they deposited or if their funds are in cold storage! Their withdrawal *always* comes from the hot wallet. The exchange uses a recent deposit to satisfy all withdrawals. Always. Otherwise, there's no way to keep funds secure.

The address space should not matter. Addresses are hashes of public keys. You can't reverse a hash function, that's the point of hash functions.
To try keys, you have to generate a key, then see if it matches any known address. You can't start with an address and find out what keys belong to it, without an exhaustive search of the key space, which is 2^256.
At least, according to my admittedly novice level crypto knowledge :)

No. Bitcoin can't die from high fees. "Nobody goes there anymore, it's too crowded!"
We just got a block size upgrade and most people still aren't taking advantage of it. If fees aren't high enough that people are bothered to switch to segwit addresses, then fees are not a problem.
There will always be people complaining about fees, that's just an indication that other people need bitcoin more than them.

It depends on the topology - if it's well-connected then one-off txs like this would work perfectly fine.
Let's use this simple topology as an example. Alice has a channel with coinbase that she received when she first purchased bitcoin (0.1 btc for her, zero for coinbase). The gas station also has a channel with coinbase (0 for him, 0.1 for coinbase). If Alice wants to buy gas, she sends with LN payment, it routes through coinbase, and the Alice-coinbase channel ends up with 0.099 for her, 0.01 coinbase, the coinbase-gasStation channel ends up with 0.099 for coinbase, 0.01 for the gas station). Coinbase's balance remains unchanged, 0.01 moves from alice to the gas station.

There is absolutely nothing about bitcoin that's any harder to learn. To use banking you had to learn that
* They're only open 9-5 M-F if you're lucky
* Any kind of transfer takes 3-5 business days if you're lucky
* You need your Debit card and memorized PIN to withdraw AND deposit
* You often cannot deposit to other people's accounts
* You have obligations to explain certain kinds of deposits and amounts
* There are pretty low limits to how much you can deposit/withdraw at an ATM and even limits on withdrawals at the teller

This is all completely irrelevant. 
The meta-argument is "should bitcoin users be free to use whatever rules they want, regardless of whether they'll end in tears".
For me the answer is "yes", no one will change my mind, and more importantly, no one can stop me or anyone else. That is the reality that the core bitcoin developers have to deal with: their knowing better than everyone else doesn't make any difference. They have no authority. They can only either a) make convincing arguments, or b) wait for the foolish to possibly crash and burn.
Edit: and the other question is, "will the activities of the foolish destroy what the wise have built?"  If the answer is "yes", then bitcoin is doomed. If that's even a possibility, it's a design flaw that needs to be fixed ASAP. If it can't be fixed, we might as well all go home.

@_date: 2017-11-09 18:30:34
Someone correct me if i'm wrong, but I believe due to the signature data being "discounted" 75%, your overall transaction gets a roughly 50% discount.
The idea is, you move your funds to a segwit address now, and use a low fee because you don't care if it takes a while (you're just sending it to yourself). Then after that, you can get 50% fee discounts on every spend you make. So it should pay off after just one spend. From then on, make sure you always receive bitcoin on a segwit address so that you don't have to move funds anymore.
Edit: the discount doesn't take into account other people using segwit too, which frees up more space and can lower your fees even more. You don't have any control over that, so I didn't get into it.

Simple and wrong. It's true that if you have bitcoin today, you'll still have them after the fork no matter which side wins. But that is not the whole story. First of all the fork could (and IMO will ) panic the market and cause the value of bitcoin to drop even before it forks. 
This will happen because all merchants and exchanges will eventually need to either choose one or put out the effort to support both. Neither of these are something non techies want to deal with. Many will see bitcoin as not ready for prime time (and IMO it isn't when decisions this basic have not been resolved - this won't be the last fork either,  or threat of fork).

Why are you arguing with things I never said? I never said that demand for fiat comes from taxes. I said you cannot choose not to participate because of taxes.

Yes, I could have been more clear, but given the subject matter I don't think it was a big leap to see what I meant. We were discussing inflation. No one can alter the inflation schedule of YOUR bitcoin currency without your consent. All they can do is try to lure away others so that you won't have a common currency with them. But honestly, good luck trying to lure people to a currency with MORE inflation (which is just a hidden tax).

Technically true, but misses the point.
Let's say you take your centralized ledger, make it downloadable. Your clients can download the latest state at any time. You also sign the ledger and the hash of the previous ledger, every time you update it. You make those signatures available as part of the download.
Now you are rather limited in the kinds of cheating you can accomplish. Really all you can do is completely rewrite the ledger history from scratch. However, the fact that your clients have a completely separate history signed by you, is pretty damning evidence that you are cheating. This is probably good enough for Patrick Byrne's purposes.
Proof of work blockchains are for censorship resistance, which is not what regulated stock markets need.

They claim on their webpage that tethers are backed by dollars. But whose dollars? I thought they had no way for customers to deposit dollars. I suppose they could be bitfinex's dollars (profits from the exchange).
But this claim is pretty dubious, would be easy to prove they had $600m in the bank. Also, they never redeem tethers for actual dollars (that I know of). I'm not sure how they can say it's "backed" by dollars if that's the case.

Yes, but you normally wouldn't want to do that.
If you want to access a bunch of different wallets, you can do that with the password feature (the seed words are the same but the password is different - every password leads to a different wallet and no one can tell what wallets even exist). The seed plus password determine which sets of keys you are accessing.
Yes, you can use the seed (and password if there is one) to access the keys on a software wallet too. Just note that this should only be used in emergencies (if you've lost access to the trezor and don't have a different one you can restore to) and not part of normal operation.

I do, it's because whatever doesn't fit inside the the solution is left completely vulnerable to fractional reserve and inflation. The protection that bitcoin offers, does you no good if you cannot actually use real bitcoin for everyday transactions. If you use "promises to pay bitcoin", then they will be inflated. Only the very rich who can afford bitcoin transactions will be protected. Is that how you want it to work?


Well, the bar is this high - there has to be enough nodes that can process ALL TRANSACTIONS ON EARTH such that at least one honest node can afford to operate (one that would publish proof of miner fraud to SPV clients). That is the same problem as scaling the internet. As soon as reasonably priced bandwidth can carry all transactions on earth, then the problem is solved. Yeah, caching layers like lightning network can help, but ultimately it's a bandwidth issue.
Bitcoin is not a trustless generic smart contract platform. It can't really do trustless trading of anything, except maybe alts.
@_date: 2019-02-22 23:56:36

How can you possibly know that? 
@_date: 2015-08-11 21:39:22


Well, it's just not true.
Hypothetically, if there were only 1 miner in the whole world and he put transactions in order, could not double spend nor censor transactions, well... then everyone is happy and nobody gives a shit if mining is not "distributed".
In practice a single miner *could* double spend and censor. So you definitely need more than one. However there's diminishing returns at some point, because as you add independent miners, relaying gets slower and slower. But there's no additional value.
If SPV fraud proofs can be implemented, then there's a very low bar for distribution of mining: there need only enough miners that none have more than about 10-20% of the hash power (and really, having more is ok but attacks become possible if not profitable). And beyond that you need 1 honest full node in the entire world (to alert SPV clients to miner fraud). 
We're talking about maybe 100 to several hundred nodes worldwide here. Beyond that we're just giving up capacity for nothing.

You could take this argument even further. If you don't build your CPU and computer from scratch, you have no idea what is actually running on it.
There's no such thing as absolute trustlessness. Why do you trust that your hardware is really doing what you told it to do, but you don't trust that a cloud provider's machine is? The amount of conspiracy and effort required to subvert one vs the other is really not that different.


So? Reorgs can happen even on full nodes. And SPV can be improved with fraud proofs so that they're on the same level as full nodes in this respect (as long as there's one honest full node in the world).

If it were me, and i wanted the bitcoin to go to a safe "savings" wallet and not be spendable by my employees as soon as it was received, I'd do something like this:
Buy a trezor.
Open the trezor wallet, make accounts for each location of your business. Copy the xpub key for each, and import it onto a mobile device running something like Samourai wallet's "Sentinel" (which only receives payments and cannot spend).
As payments come in, you'll be able to see and spend them using the trezor, but the mobile devices will only be able to receive and not spend.
Edit: notice you do not need a "platform", that's the beauty of bitcoin!
Edit: PM me if you're interested in consultation
@_date: 2019-12-11 16:34:15
I've been struggling with this as well.
I think you may be overcomplicating it.
There are two kinds of protection: physical (where a person will physically stop you from accessing the physical location) and informational (secrets in your brain not written anywhere, including physically unprotected locations, like a place where you buried something). You should decide up front the scheme of how many "shares" will be protected by each type, and then just do a straight multisig. I would recommend eliminating the trezor PIN/pw from the equation. You can store a trezor physically but it's equivalent to storing a paper copy of the seed in the same place. Trezor pin/pw is (mostly) equivalent to deriving another multisig seed from those two secrets.
Let me try to simplify your arrangement. 
* You memorize a secret (don't reuse your lastpass secret), and use it to derive 3 seeds. The script used to derive it and the "salts" added to make each one unique can be public or semi-public (keep it in your gmail and/or written down wherever, it won't help an attacker). The secret doesn't have to be high-entropy necessarily, as long as you do sufficient key stretching using a KDF like scrypt. I am using this technique currently, can give you more details if you like.
* Do the same for one seed for your SO
* Generate 3 more seeds from entropy source like dice and write them down. Store with family member, outside home, and bank vault.
Now you've got 3+1+3=7 secrets. Make the threshold 4.
* You and your SO can access funds only with the secrets in your heads - fireproof 
* If you forget your secret or die, your SO can use the physical seeds and their memorized secret.
* There are only 3 physical secrets so burglary insufficient attack
* Your family/SO cannot collude unless the bank is compromised.
* If you AND your SO die at the same time, the funds are inaccessible. You can tinker with this by including a copy of one of your memorized seeds in a physical location, probably the bank (I'm presuming here the bank only allows you access until you die, then your SO, then family). 
In general I think people tend to be overly biased toward protecting against theft, when loss is actually the far more realistic risk. When in doubt protect yourself from losing access vs worrying about being targeted by governments. Use the lower threshold or make an extra copy. Also don't forget that usually attacks don't come out of nowhere. If you're worried, for example, that your bank or family might eventually turn on you but you have no particular reason to suspect them now, you can start with a scheme that trusts them more, and if your trust starts to erode, you can move your coins to a new scheme.

So you **are** fucking around. I am not trying to knock you for it, we all want to play around with bitcoin just to get a feel for it.
Unfortunately bitcoin has grown, perhaps a little too fast for its own good.
Bitcoin is supposed to be censorship resistant above all else, which ends up costing money assuming lots of people need it. You don't need censorship resistance here, so maybe try an alt, if you can find anyone who wants to accept it.
Lots of things have changed in bitcoin history, that simply comes with the territory of astonishing exponential growth. You used to be able to mine with a laptop and now you can't. Or a GPU and now you can't. You used to be able to send money for zero fees, and now you can't.

They do not care that they had a chance at $200 million, either one is "rich" to them, and the risk of losing it all is too great to hold that long.

Ok, sure, but BCH holders paid to lure miners away from bitcoin. It doesn't really work all that well, as we saw.
What happened was, BCH holders were forcibly taxed (whether they agreed or not, they tacitly agreed just by holding BCH). Miners moved to BCH. Then bitcoin fees went up until miners started being lured back to bitcoin (and also EDA ended but the fees would have kept going up to bring miners back). At least on the bitcoin side, it wasn't tax, it was voluntary payment.

Well, it's technically not illegal, I'm sure all the hyperinflations throughout history have been legal.
What I mean is, with government-issued currency (fiat), there is no guarantee. The government (or Fed) controls the inflation and can change it unexpectedly. You also cannot choose not to participate (your tax bill is due in fiat regardless of what currency you use for everyday business - so you must buy fiat).
With bitcoin, you can look at its inflation schedule at the beginning, and decide if you want to participate. No one can force you to participate, prevent you from participating. The inflation schedule is fixed and cannot be changed.

Their plan is to make some money, get out and move on to something else. They will be utterly shocked when bitcoin is still around in 10 years. 
We're wasting our time trying to get these people to withdraw their coins. In fact, we WANT their coins to get stolen! (OK i won't speak for you all, *I* do). I want their coins to get hacked or seized and then market dumped a short time later. Why would I want that? So I can scoop them up cheap and lock them away until the price hits $1m or more. You should be doing the same. Teach these people why censorship resistance is important - by experience.
These people (along with everyone else) are your adversaries in the market.

I think we put way too much effort into arguing about the meaning of the word "scam". Who cares what the intent is? Bitcoin maximalists believe altcoins (that have existed up to today) are basically useless and a poor long term investment. 
People with no experience in crypto are trying to gauge intent to determine what to invest in, and this is completely misguided. If you are a crypto investor and you find yourself looking at a coin's founders or dev team to determine their intent, you should just stop and buy bitcoin. You have no prayer whatsoever of getting it right. (This is for long term investment - if you want to gamble on alts, go right ahead, as long as you know that's what you're doing).

$30 a month is insanely cheap for a full node.
Here's the thing. SPV security is pretty good, and it can theoretically be made even better (if 's fraud proofs work as advertised and are implemented:  )
I cannot see any reason that end-users will be running full nodes. With fraud proofs enabled, there only has to be ONE honest full node in the entire world. Then if it detects that the longest chain SPV clients are using is actually invalid, it publishes the proof and then SPV clients stop using it.
Just think about how high the cost of running a full node would have to be, before you were not 100% confident that at least one of them was honest.
It's a hell of a lot more than $30 a month. Probably at least 100 times that. Corporations, universities, government organizations around the world, can easily afford $3000 a month to run a full node. The odds that ALL of them would conspire to hide mining fraud, seems so low as to not be a real concern.
Add to that the fact that even nodes who can't keep up bandwidth-wise still have a chance of detecting fraud (they don't need every transaction in every block, just the two with the double-spends or one that creates bitcoin from nowhere). Put together enough of those, and you have a high likelihood of detection. 
@_date: 2015-07-23 19:42:59
You're joking but those things will solve it to some degree.
* Caching layer for when locking up some funds temporarily is better than having to pay fees
* Block size increase (it really doesn't matter if not everyone can run a full node, all that is needed is ONE honest node in the entire world) - see 's SPV fraud proofs article : 
* Moore's law obviously gives greater capacity every year for the same price point.

In the scenario where the IRS switched to property tax, the idea is you're paying to have your property rights enforced. If you live in the middle of nowhere, not only do you probably not need that, your property is probably not worth much anyway. So you could either just pay the small tax, or squat on someone else's land and just move if you're caught.
As it stands today (income tax), you could work as a programmer for a foreign company, get paid in bitcoin, and nobody would be reporting your income to the IRS. You could do that living anywhere, even a major city.

You're not getting it.
If you're forking deliberately and non-aggressively (you're not trying to destroy the other fork, just leave them), you don't do it on the same network.
You just take the bitcoin blockchain, and start a new network with it such that it has zero nodes in common with the original. It has no effect whatsoever on the original network, aside from perhaps some miners migrating to your network.
This is not necessarily an easy thing to do but all that is required is some tooling. Hell, we already have an alt-coin generator, there's no reason you can't do the same with bitcoin "friendly forks".

Seems unlikely B2X will win. 
The only way 2x wins is if users decide to take orders from miners. (Miners say "you will use the rules we tell you!", users say "yes sir Mr miner, you are the authority that I obey!")

Seems more likely more of them will just wait while miners bleed money, until the miners give up.

This assumes that the market didn't price in the halving last time, and after getting caught with its pants down DID IT AGAIN THE NEXT TIME.
I suppose it's possible (since the market is actually not all the same individuals as 4 years prior), but mostly I think the halvings have basically nothing to do with anything. We've got like 2 data points here we're trying to make a trend out of. It's reaching.

Another 100-fold gain is about as much bitcoin can gain without significantly weakening fiat currencies. So beyond that, pricing it in dollars starts to lose meaning. 


No, it can't be paid back. But that doesn't mean society will collapse from it. Even the 2008 crisis, which was billed as the worst since the great depression, was basically a non-event, a slightly worse than usual recession that have been happening for a century. If debt collapses, there will be a bunch of defaults and lenders who won't be repaid. And that's it. It could be really bad, or it might not be. Depends on who the lenders are and how much risk they can actually afford.

Well, sort of. 
Street violence is unpredictable. State violence is at least predictable, most of the time. While citizens may not agree with the rules, they at least have a method to reliably avoid violence that they see as reasonably priced. That's the state's whole balancing act: doing whatever they want, as long as it doesn't raise the cost of avoiding violence too high. If they raise it too high, the people cannot avoid violence, so overthrowing the government becomes the most efficient solution. The state doesn't want that, obviously. So they set tax rates just high enough, and rules just strict enough, that they believe the people would rather obey than revolt.
Any rules/tax that a citizen believes he can disobey, and benefit without violence, he will. That's where propaganda comes in - it's way cheaper to convince people to obey for ideological reasons, than to try to catch everyone who disobeys.

This has been discussed thousands of times already, but:
Once the speculative phase ends, bitcoin will only go up in value in proportion to growth in the economy (demand for money goes up). So your fears that bitcoin will go up in value while the economy shrinks is just not possible. Think about it, if bitcoin supply stays the same and the amount of goods in the world shrinks, how can you be getting richer by holding bitcoin? You can't. You can only get richer if the goods are increasing.

Venezuela is "collapsing horribly" - people losing basic infrastructure like food and power because everything there has been horribly mismanaged for a long time.
I just don't see that happening in the US even if the dollar imploded. Granted, that's in part because bitcoin is there to take over if the dollar goes tits up.

It's a bit more nuanced than that.
If bitcoin scaled infinitely, perhaps. But it doesn't.
It's difficult to do high speed trading on anything but a centralized order book. And centralized implies permissioned.
You're right that banks are the problem because they *want* their systems to be permissioned. There's other entities who would operate these systems, who would just as soon have them permissionless, it's just that the technology doesn't (and can't) enforce it.

Meanwhile bitcoin is an awesome unseizable asset. It'll do just fine on that alone, and over time it will expand into a better medium of exchange.

Stop saying this. "anything you can't lose" is undefined without giving probabilities.
Example: someone offers you a bet: 99% chance of making a 100x your money, 1% chance of losing it. In that case, poor people should bet more of their savings than rich people. If you're poor, and you lose your savings, well, you can easily replace it because you hardly had any anyway. And increasing it 100x will make a big difference in lifestyle. If you're rich, you probably don't want to take 1% risk of losing everything, because it will be really hard to start over. And being 100x richer won't change your life much.

It's almost certainly being lost much slower than inflation. Back when bitcoin was practically worthless, it was easy to forget about 10,000 btc. Now that basically doesn't happen, ever. It's probably rare for anyone to lose 1 BTC today, and there's no way it happens 1800 times a day.
As for when the rates will cross, it's impossible to say - it depends on the price, but probably not for decades.
As others have said, there's no way to prove a secret was destroyed and no copy was kept. So you'll never get an even remotely accurate count of lost coins. There is a way to burn coins, which is provable, but very few coins have been burnt vs suspected to be lost.

I don't understand why this is necessary.
The **entire reason** bitcoin works at all is that it is more profitable for miners to mine honestly (producing a product that people want to buy) vs attacking another network (just blocking legitimate transactions and probably not producing anything valuable).
I see no reason why two networks wouldn't coexist peacefully even if one could (in theory) attack the other.
Either the smaller network is a threat to overtake the larger one, or it isn't. If it is not a threat, it's not worth attacking. If it is a threat, it's more profitable to mine honestly.

If your ruleset matches someone else's, you're using the same currency as them.
If the ruleset is different (and any transaction fits one ruleset but not the other), then you're not using the same currency, but two different forks.
So anyone can change the 21 million limit anytime they want, but that would create a fork. Unless they convinced others to use the same ruleset, they'd be alone on that fork with a very useless currency (nobody mining transactions nor accepting it as payment).

Yes, it's normal - early blocks were nearly empty and take far less time to process than recent ones, which are full.
However, taking 2 weeks is not necessarily "normal" - it depends on your hardware. If you have either a) slow internet, under 10 mbit/s b) slow CPU, as in low end or very old c) non-ssd hard drive, it may be normal for it to take that long.
High end consumer hardware can probably sync in a few hours, but 2 weeks is closer to what you'd expect from a raspberry pi or similar.

There has to be a better answer than that.
What if the spammers threshold was $50? Would you be comfortable kicking out all monetary transfers unwilling to pay more than that?
In reality, I can't see how there can be non-monetary uses of the bitcoin blockchain that would be willing to pay that much. I would think $1 would probably eliminate pretty much all of them. Would you agree?
@_date: 2016-02-14 16:12:26
Yeah, I have considered the difficulty reset mechanism to be a major problem with what is supposed to be a "voluntary" currency. It's not really voluntary if splits cause the entire ecosystem to fall apart.
I tried to come up with a better way, and I think I have, but it results in a system very different from what we have now.
Here's how it would work: Get rid of difficulty altogether, consensus rules allow any amount of PoW. This would mean there will be lots of branching. Reduce overall orphan rate with the following: miners include multiple "previous block" hashes to do the equivalent of "git merge" of multiple branches. Blocks (or even single transactions) are mined *before* being broadcast, users pay miners via whatever means the user and miner agree to (probably micropayment channel but could be physical cash, gold, etc).
The block reward still depends on luck, but the amount varies instead of the period. Let's say the median of the last 100 blocks PoW hash contains 10 leading zeros (in binary). To come up with a hash that contains 16 leading zeros, on average you'd have to do 2^16 (65536) hashes. But some miners might get lucky and find this after 2^10 (1024) hashes. They get a block reward proportional to their luck ( 2^(16-10-1) or 32). They can't game this by just applying more hashpower, because they'd spend their whole reward on electricity. It's also discourages skimping on PoW because anything less than the median PoW has no chance of reward.
There's still a lot of details to be worked out here, (especially how to keep the user/miner relationship honest) but I think the overall idea is reasonably sound. I started writing a simulation of this to see if I can find failure cases, but I'm only about 1/4 done so no results yet.

Banks are never going to use censorship resistant ledgers.
What they are talking about now is using crypto that they **could** have been using in the 1990's: digital signatures and hashes. This lets banks do business with each other, without having to worry the other bank is going to lie or cheat. They have no intention (still) of proving to their consumers that they're not lying or cheating. 
The reason they're suddenly interested in 1990's crypto, is that bitcoin is real competition that cannot be regulated out of existence by 1950's era dinosaurs.

I'm sure you're aware there are several billion "desperately poor" who also deserve sound money.
Do we expect many millions of people to want sound money or not? If not, then bitcoin has basically failed already. I guess it could continue to occupy the black market niche, but that really wasn't the goal. If so, then there has to be space for them all to fit! Otherwise everyone who doesn't fit is locked out.
My entire point from the beginning is that those people would much rather take SPV security as opposed to nothing.

Yes, orthogonal components is the general way to achieve this, but more specifically how would it be done?
I see several components here. One is a proof of work service - applies proof of work to arbitrary data. How that work is paid for would be a separate component. Another is history management (similar to what source control systems do, like git). Another is the relay network. Another is consensus rule application.
I see no reason why these things are bound up into a single component (ok, well at least the consensus rules are split out into libconsensus - but there should be a generic interface).
I'm sure making these things separate and generic is not easy, but I think it could be done if that was the goal from the beginning.

OP's scenario could be the result of honest behavior? Seems like it could only happen if the node is trying to gather info that its peers don't intend to provide (where transactions originated).
I can see that you do need to be very careful, but it seems way too easy to deploy a node that eats up its peers' bandwidth, which is the precious resource that all this block size fighting has been over. You did mention a workaround though - was that a per-peer setting or total upload limit?

Is the management of channels something you can hide from users?

It's not symmetrical.
If adoption increases and fees rise to $10 (or more), the low-income will be priced out completely from a small block bitcoin.

There isn't an objectively "best" ruleset, so I don't even think this would be ideal.

Slow key derivation is one way to make brain wallets safer, but you should really consider whether this is the right solution for you.
Seems to me the only use case for a brain wallet is if you have nowhere else to safely store your keys. (If you were under surveillance by authorities or something).
Other options are: multisig address with friends/family as co-signers, physical safe (or safe deposit box), cloud storage (possibly with steganography - hide keys in a family photo - but be careful you don't forget which photo it is!)
People tend to overestimate their long term memory. If you plan on storing bitcoin for the long term, a brain wallet is probably the highest risk way to do it.

A bitcoin loving merchant would want bitcoin enough to actually hold it as an investment or as an unseizable asset.
I'd argue that most mainstream businesses accepting bitcoin now are doing it more as a marketing stunt than anything else. If they really saw the value in it, they'd offer a discount to get it.
I imagine mainstream businesses will be one of the last to embrace bitcoin. They'll be pressured into it from the inside, not the outside: their employees will ask to be paid in it, and the easiest way to do that is to accept bitcoin in the shop.

Yeah, that's not my point.
My point was, coinbase doesn't go very far to protect you from hackers. They don't care, because if you get hacked, they just blame you and your money is gone.
Their default setup (no 2FA) is totally insecure. If they cared at all, they would not allow deposit or withdrawal without 2FA set up.
And there are smaller (yet still dangerous) holes that they do basically nothing to stop users from falling into. Using your phone as 2FA when you have the coinbase app on the same phone is dangerous. Using authy as 2FA is more dangerous than google authenticator but authy is the default.

Exactly, this halving theory (that x months after the halving we go into full bull run mode) is half baked.
As you said, we have like 2 data points. Even if we KNEW those two data points had a causal relationship with the halving, that DOES NOT MEAN it will happen again. If everyone knows the price will rise after the halving, any rational person would buy before that, thus breaking the trend.
I don't see how the market can simultaneously believe the price will rise at that time, AND not rise before that.

Oh, yeah, my point had nothing to do with ASICBOOST. I see the problem with it, but not 100% convinced it needs to be fixed. What's the difference between 20% boost to a favored miner enforced by local patent law, and 20% subsidy in electricity of a favored miner enforced by the local state? You can't really prevent favoritism. Bitcoin doesn't care about patents. If some miners do, one could argue that's their problem. On the other hand I don't see the harm in fixing the ASICBOOST hole.
My point was about PoW algo in general, and that my theory is they'll all centralize, and many of them will re-decentralize as hardware becomes commodity, so we shoud not reset the clock. Edit: note, fixing the asicboost hole will not reset the clock - existing hardware will still work, so I have no problem with fixing it.

Nobody else can overwrite the rules that you follow.
If blocks don't conform to your rules, they do not exist. Now, whether your ruleset appeals to the market is another issue. But if there's even a small market, there will very likely be miners willing to mine the product and sell it.
Sure, it's possible your minority of the hashpower will get attacked by someone who doesn't care about profit. But as is always the case, it's more profitable to mine honestly (miners produce a product and sell it) than to attack (where the mining power produces nothing that anyone wants to buy).

That's not really what I meant, because all the nodes you mentioned are using the same codebase.
Also, SPV mining is not as generic as it could be. SPV miners still can only get paid one way - with the block reward and fees. They are just assuming the transactions are valid, because if they're not, they don't get paid. I'd like to see totally agnostic mining. In other words, miners don't give a shit what data they're adding PoW to, because you're directly paying them to do it. Granted that's a big change from how bitcoin currently works.

I don't think it's that simple - generally bitcoin is for disobeying authority. The most known form of that is buying drugs online. But there are more authorities than drug enforcement agencies.
The most important of which is central banks - their authority sets the inflation rate, and you can disobey that authority by using bitcoin (whose inflation rate is known ahead of time).
However for some people it is simply not necessary to use bitcoin for everyday transactions. Let's say you keep your savings in bitcoin and your spending money in fiat. If your spending money loses less to inflation than you'd have spent in bitcoin transaction fees, you'd be better off using fiat for spending (all else equal).
This depends heavily on a) what your fiat inflation rate is compared to bitcoin and b) what bitcoin transaction fees are.
If transaction fees go way up, people will stop using it for everyday transactions. Their spending money may lose to inflation, but their savings will not. Unfortunately that means those without significant savings will be priced out.
That's why I foresee a high-capacity, low fee, lower security network coming to take that niche. That may be a sidechain, or a fork, or a totally different network.

It's not like a debit card at all.
With a debit card, there's no limit to the amount of money your account can hold. With LN, not only is there a limit, but that limit must be chosen **in advance**. Imagine opening a checking account and having to decide up-front the maximum amount of money you'll ever deposit in it.
If LN becomes very popular, bitcoin mining fees for opening and closing channels could get quite high. Users will need to decide in advance who they want to open a channel with (and weigh the risks) and decide how long the channel should last. And if they choose wrong, their money could be temporarily inaccessible, or they could incur high fees to switch to a new channel.

They also recommend and default to authy, which I believe is not as secure - since you can recover onto a different phone, all that is needed is your authy password, which seems to defeat the purpose of 2FA.

The video does not support your claim.
You're assuming that if we increased the bandwidth requirements for a full node, that fewer miners than today would be able to mine. I think that's easily disproven - the reason there are so few miners today has nothing whatsoever to do with bandwidth requirements. It has everything to do with economy of scale.
As far as I can tell, the primary reason why bandwidth requirements can't be easily increased, is because nodes have to verify transactions before they can be relayed on. That introduces a delay at each hop in the relay network. More transactions to verify = more delay. I think there's a solution to that (assuming it is the main hurdle): don't relay unconfirmed transactions at all. Instead of letting any miner mine your transaction, you just choose one and submit directly to them. The relay network would then be for blocks only (which already have DoS protection because you can just verify PoW before relaying, no need to verify all the txs until later). And the blockchain would probably need to be turned into a DAG - such that each block can "merge" multiple non-conflicting ancestors, instead of having a single ancestor.
The video does highlight though, an easy method for governments to attack bitcoin - what China may already be doing. That is, give free electricity. All the miners migrate into your country. Once the majority of miners are there, send in men with guns to hijack the mining facilities and halt the network.
However this attack is not likely to succeed in the long term. Switching PoW would happen quickly (within a week or two, max), and then potential miners would learn a lesson - if you take subsidized electricity, you're risking loss of your entire capital investment.

I think it's clear that the number of bitcoins lost is definitely not zero. How many are lost is not known, but consider how many early miners lost interest and threw away their keys. There's no denying that this happened, it's only a question of how frequent it was. Mtgox coins aren't lost, they're still accessible by someone.

Great, I'll keep an eye out for that, thanks.


Yes, I didn't get into that part because it's the mechanism I have the least confidence in. My thinking was that the system does not need a realtime clock, because if you look at a window of the latest blocks, you should get a good idea of the overall network hash rate (the rate per block should reflect the entire network's rate, because miners are always competing for rewards). However I don't know yet how to choose exactly what window width to look at.

The number of bitcoin network users isn't easily tracked, so txs are used as an estimate. A rather poor estimate, as you point out. 
Is it that you don't think Metcalfe's law holds at all, or just that this graph is a poor way to try to demonstrate it?
Personally I would bet that if we had the data for the square of number of users, it would track the price much more closely than the square of number of txs. I don't think that explaining correlations between bubbles and trade volume to be a violation of Metcalfe's law - aren't traders are just as valid a bitcoin user as any other?

I think this is likely untrue. You can use *much* lower entropy secrets if, the process of converting the secret into a seed is very expensive. That severely limits the brute force rate that an attacker can achieve. Fortunately there are readily available algorithms that do exactly this. I have used the program that does scrypt key derivation here  and used the parameters as follows: scrypt-kdf thepassword thesalt 8388608 8 8
On my modern laptop, that uses 8gb of ram for several minutes to produce the key. You can increase the parameters as high as you like, to balance the amount of entropy in your pw with the amount of resources one guess should take. Lower entropy means more waiting for you to access your secret, but you don't care about that and can set that really high (hours or even several days).


I didn't mean get rid of the trezor. Just don't use PIN/passphrase on it. You can always recover your seed(s) onto trezor(s) to avoid it touching a hot machine. However I admit that's harder with my suggestion because you need to derive the seed using a computer, so you would need a dedicated offline machine for that.
If you want to have this wallet be "hot" (spend from it multiple times) then using the method I suggested would be less ideal.

I see no reason whatsoever that scamcoins should not be listed on exchanges. The idea that an exchange listing a coin somehow makes it legitimate, is a regulated stock market idea that simply isn't valid here. While we're at it, why don't we shut down exchanges on evenings and weekends just so it matches expectations of people coming from the stock market? It makes no sense at all.
People's expectations need to conform to reality, not the other way around.
I can maybe hear an argument that bch's brand confusion is the real problem that exchanges have a duty to clear up. But even that I find doubtful. If you want to buy "bitcoin", every single exchange in question gives you the correct product if you find the ticker for "bitcoin".

You're getting paid in dollars and you've hired a third party to automatically convert so that it is fairly seamless to receive bitcoin instead of dollars.
It may seem like a nitpick, but it's very different from a privacy and censorship resistance perspective. "Getting paid in bitcoin" means your employer sends bitcoin directly to you, and it's still extremely rare. Companies don't want to have their bank close their account due to bitcoin activity. Almost none will take this risk, at best they will allow their employees to take the risk.

Bitcoin slides into irrelevance and higher-capacity chains take over. Offering LN or sidechains isn't a solution, because those involve tradeoffs. If a bitcoin chain doesn't offer as much on-chain capacity as it can while maintaining security, it is doomed.
If we need miners to be able to use Tor to be secure, fine, but the capacity of Tor connections is going to increase over time (and has been increasing during bitcoin's existence). If bitcoin doesn't take advantage of that, some other chain will.

The hubris here is just astounding. This article is written as if competition will never happen. Hate to break this to you, but there's no barriers to entry in this space. Network effect doesn't apply here, since competition comes from ledger forks also. Using a fork carries virtually no risk, since your coins exist on both. If you find someone to transact with on the fork, great, if not, it doesn't hurt you.
If bitcoin doesn't increase the block size, the great forking is coming.

I'm genuinely curious then, what they think the purpose of it is.
If it's not censorship resistant, then what is attractive about it over ebay? The only real benefit I can see is that the unbanked can use it to sell items for bitcoin (and then spend bitcoin either on OpenBazaar again, or with any merchant who takes bitcoin).
I don't see any ebay user switching to OpenBazaar unless there's something you can buy (edit: or sell) on OB that you can't buy or sell on ebay. There's probably some stuff that ebay censors that isn't illegal, that OB might pick up on.

No shit. We're talking about a new way of checking identities - possession of a secret is the new way.
Trivializing this system by saying "if you lose a thumb drive, you lose your car" is a straw man. That is not how the system would work, obviously.
The author of this article needs to read about public key infrastructure. There's ways of making secrets even more immune to theft or loss than whatever the DMV uses to verify identity.
Edit: and I am not even talking about certificate authorities here. You can do quite a bit without those, you only need them to tie a crypto identity to a meatspace identity. That would probably be something governments want for some things - tax collection especially. For commerce where threats of violence are not needed, certificate authorities are not needed either.

I think bitcoin is already too complex. In order for people to make informed decisions on which rule set they want to run, they need to be able to understand the consequences of each option, or at least be able to hire someone they trust, who can understand it.
Currently there's hardly one you can consult aside from the people who produce the rule sets to begin with (and you can't take their word for what the consequences are).
Can bitcoin be redesigned into an easier-to-understand set of rules? I don't know, it's certainly not easy.
However simplicity of implementation was probably never a design goal, so there's probably quite a bit of room for improvement if that was made a priority.

I expect bitcoin to almost completely usurp gold's role in the marketplace. It's absolutely superior to gold overall, and only inferior in a couple of categories (eg tradition and fungibility) where bitcoin can still make big strides.
The thing is, gold is not the only asset that bitcoin competes with. It also competes quite well with pretty much the whole m2 money supply (savings accounts, money markets etc) - a $90 trillion market. There is no reason why it shouldn't usurp that entire market as well.
Overall we're talking nearly $100T of gold and money that I expect bitcoin to take over if it succeeds. That's a price per coin of roughly $6,100,000.
This won't happen overnight of course, it might take a whole generation or more. And it's not guaranteed to succeed, for example governments may attack it.

Bitcoin is voluntary, such a thing is not possible.
If someone releases new bitcoin software with consensus rules you do not like, you simply ignore it. Sure, 99% of other users may go the other way, leaving you and your like-minded friends on a not-very-secure fork. In fact, everyone but you and your friends may choose not to mine the fork. And the difficulty reset mechanism of bitcoin sucks such that you may be left "high and dry" unable to produce a block yourselves for quite some time.
This is still not "force". I'd slike the see the difficulty reset mechanism fixed to prevent the "high and dry" scenario. That would make the playing field more even, and make things more truly voluntary.
Edit: it's still possible for you to just modify the software yourselves to reset the difficulty to whatever you want.

You shouldn't accept one of these devices from an untrusted person without running the verification. If you run it and it's a malicious device, the check will fail, alerting you to the attack. That doesn't stop the attack from happening, but since you'll know about it immediately, there's probably not much to be gained from it.
I suppose it may be theoretically possible for a malicious device to compromise your laptop such that it falsely reports a successful check of what's actually a fake opendime. That's a pretty sophisticated attack, close to impossible, especially if the attacker doesn't know beforehand what operating system will be used to verify.

There's a great strategy afoot in many places these days: Put out a product that is totally non-threatening to authorities. What the authorities fail to realize is that it could become very threatening with a simple patch. Once the product is popular, throw the switch with the patch.
Tesla seems to be doing this with the self-driving car.
OB could do this with a simple patch to enable tor. In fact, the patch could come from anyone, not the OB creators, since it's open source. If I were them, and nobody produced such a patch within a year, I'd create it myself (under a pseudonym of course so no one could prove it was me).

Who cares? They all use something even worse now, so if bitcoin forces real competition, then the people still won. If authorities cannot block payments, seize accounts, or arbitrarily inflate the money supply, does it really matter whether it's called bitcoin or something else? It only matters to bitcoin investors (which I admit I'm one of). 
Personally I think the masses have always been financially manipulated, that isn't going to change. Even if "hyperbitcoinization" happens (which I would not bet on), that doesn't mean all possible scams cease to exist. It just gives people a choice that they don't have today. I think most people will still choose to do stupid things with their money.

They use a trusted execution environment, you can verify the chip maker's signature that it's running what it claims to be running.

The supply can't be artificially limited unless you're referring to this particular piece of software (or more accurately, the rules that it sets).
The supply will almost certainly be increased by a fork that increases block size and competes with the current bitcoin.
Personally I don't see why that isn't the best outcome for everyone. Bitcoin keeps its high level of censorship resistance, and a similar product emerges to occupy the niche of slightly lower censorship resistance but higher capacity. Would be nice if the new fork was a sidechain so that the money supply doesn't increase, but TBH I don't think it makes much difference in the end. If it was not a sidechain, the price of both chains would adjust and everything would be fine.

There's a script provided by opendime. It's on the device itself, but of course you should not use the one on an untrusted device, you can get it from opendime's github also.
As for being offline, I think you can prove the legitimacy of the device offline. And now this is just conjecture on my part, I'll let an expert chime in - but I think you can be sure the device has a balance if you're offline now BUT you downloaded the blockchain earlier (beyond the block where the device was loaded) and the device is legit and hasn't had its tab broken. However if you went offline before the device was loaded, you have no way to verify if it's been loaded since.
Edit: in theory someone could provide you with the rest of the blockchain data somehow, but that's not exactly "offline" since you are still transferring blockchain data to your computer somehow.

Granted, I hid a lot of complexity in "just modify the software yourselves". It's not a one line change. You'd probably want to a) reset the difficulty such that "at block height x (where the fork happens), ignore normal difficulty calculation and hardcode it to n, then resume normal calculation for following blocks" b) optionally, make any protocol change (eg, swap positions of fields in a transaction) that makes transactions from the other network invalid on yours and vice versa.

I'm not following your logic. The cost of mining 12.5 bitcoin may approach the value of 12.5 bitcoin, but there are already 15 million bitcoins mined, many of which were mined when the cost was a few cents.
Besides, I'm talking about how much security is **required** not how much it has in reality. Let's say today you can halt the network for a few million a day. Lots of organizations can afford that, nearly any nation-state. If bitcoin grows 1000x in value, if you get proportional security, it'd cost a few **billion** a day to attack. That's probably overkill, nobody is going to spend that much, since the attack would be temporary and it would be a cat and mouse game instead of an outright victory for the attacker.

So let me get this straight:
* This is one guy who says some bank will offer bitcoin wallets, but not which bank 
* Doesn't say whether the private keys will be held by the bank (in which case it's really a 'bitcoin investment account') or the customer (in which case what do you need the bank for)
My guess is we'll never hear anything about this again.

Let's say everyone is mining with solar, zero marginal cost and $6400/btc block reward. What will happen then? Everyone and their mother does the same thing, driving up difficulty until solar panels required to mine cost more than 10 years worth of mining revenue. 
All that matters is the cost of mining vs the revenue. Efficiency or what powers the miner are irrelevant, as i said.

Exactly, the degree to which you need bitcoin is proportional to the degree to which you are willing to disobey authority. Same with running your own website - if you're just posting selfies and your dinner, nobody is going to stop you from posting it on facebook and it's easier than running your own site.
But if you want to publish corporate secrets or politically dangerous ideas, that's a different story. Same with bitcoin.
Maybe you don't want to buy what they say you can buy, or give up whatever portion of your income they tell you to give up, or jump through whatever regulatory hoops they tell you to jump through.

Bitcoin could have better privacy, for sure, but it's still not easy to attach names and faces to blockchain transactions. Note that the identity of most bitcoin thieves remains unknown, even with the imperfect privacy it bitcoin currently offers.


"not be allowed" by whom, and by what means? You think the government declaring "you must register your bitcoin addresses with us" is going to have any effect? Of course it won't, people will just ignore it, and there is nothing the government can do about it. They have no way to know what bitcoin address you're using. You just generate a new one and use that.
There are some ways for government to stop people from using bitcoin:
* Convince everyone that they don't want to use bitcoin (with lies or threats of violence)
* 51% attack the network and sustain the attack
* Shut down the entire internet
None of those attacks are easy or cheap or politically expedient.

How would you, as the movie studio, read the watermark later, unless you saved the random numbers so you'd know where to find the watermark?
If you save the random numbers, and embed them into a tool that detects the watermark, and distribute the tool, then everyone can look in the tool for the locations, then remove the watermark from the movie.
My whole point is that you should definitely NOT distribute the tool. That's shooting yourself in the foot. By embedding a bitcoin key, and distributing a tool by which anyone can claim the bitcoin, you're also distributing the knowledge of **where** the watermark is, and hence helping people remove the watermark.


Now you've lost me. What does this have to do with watermarking?

It doesn't matter. If you have an app that detects the watermark, you just keep experimenting with encodings of the movie, testing it against the app, until the app fails to detect the watermark.
Then you've got a technique that will likely work for all movies that use that app. 
@_date: 2016-09-21 21:08:54


No I get it. And the best way for the studio to get what they want is to not bother with any of that bullshit, and just not distribute the app at all. Then they do not have to create many versions of it and create a whole software publishing infrastructure.
All they need to do is download a few torrents and run the tool against them. And they can keep their bitcoin.

I sort of understand the desire for physical bitcoin - we saw all this science fiction where people paid with "cred sticks" or whatever, and it seemed really cool, and we want that to be a real thing.
But those sci-fi plots never explained how those systems avoided counterfeiting. The fictional currencies had the same problem physical bitcoin does: either you have to be online or you're vulnerable to counterfeiting.

I personally think bitcoin is about offering a choice where there was none before. The majority of the population though, will not choose bitcoin no matter how much it could benefit them. They're scared or distracted or both. They will choose E-coin. As a community I think it's important we accept this reality up front.
The reason I still prefer bitcoin even though it can never scale to accomodate billions of people, is because **it will never need to**. It will always be a niche. 
@_date: 2016-09-20 15:32:49
I have never used the seed recovery function, but my understanding is that it asks you to input the words out of order. So even if the machine is compromised, it does not know the order of the seed words, which contains 50-something bits of entropy. That's impractical to brute force.

Why is that even an option?
What Kraken *should* do is disallow all withdrawals on accounts which do not have 2FA. And I mean real 2FA not this "static password" BS that is just a trick to get customers to deposit money thinking that it's secure, when it isn't.
To enable withdrawals on funds that were deposited without 2FA enabled, the customer would need to enable 2FA and wait 2 weeks. The waiting period would help ensure that if a hacker tries to enable 2FA, the customer would be notified and block the withdrawal.
That way a customer can delay using 2FA (he can deposit and trade all he wants, but not withdraw). Kraken gets their fees, and the customer doesn't lose everything.
Any customer who would object to this, can either be told to take a hike, or sign a waiver with very large bold letters saying "I RECOGNIZE THIS IS INSECURE AND MY FUNDS COULD BE STOLEN. I HOLD THE EXCHANGE BLAMELESS IN THIS EVENT." (edit: of course they would have to choose before depositing: agree either to this waiver, or the eventual 2 week waiting period, or enable 2FA before they deposit)

The masses don't care about censorship resistance. If they could get it for free, sure, they'd take it. But it's not free, it's hard to use properly (and always will be harder than just swiping a credit card), and it is slow and more expensive than a centralized system could be.
That's exactly what you see happening with bitcoin. "Wait, so it's not confirmed for 10 minutes and I have to back up my private keys, and the value could swing 20% in a day? Why the hell would I want to buy coffee with this?" We have no answer. There's no reason. Nobody's trying to stop them from buying coffee, so their existing payment system works perfectly fine.

This is just how bitcoin works. It keeps track of outputs, and when you spend an output, you have to spend the whole thing and create new outputs. You can't leave anything behind. So what you do is specify two outputs - one for the recipient, and another that you own (the change address).

Aside from causing a bubble that we can all profit from, I don't think it's good news overall. If this happens, the alt-dollar will follow soon after.
Banks are just going to inflate their "promises to pay bitcoin" with fractional reserve. Just like they do today with dollars. The prices of "bitcoin" and "promise to pay bitcoin" will diverge.

This is not how bitcoin works. It could be $10,000 in 6 months. You buy as early as possible. It is a binary bet - it will either go to zero or the moon. The odds of moon in the next 6 months (IMO) are far higher than odds of it going to zero.

A blockchain is for a ledger which you do not control (its control is distributed). So there's one of two ways to go here:
1) You try to use "blockchain" for a ledger you control, and you fail because even though it may sort of work, it's grossly inefficient compared to just explicitly controlling it via a central database.
2) You use a blockchain for a ledger you do not control. At that point it's an altcoin, which probably has worse properties overall than bitcoin.

I get tired of hearing "the market is manipulated by whales". Yeah, whales can move the price much further than you can. So what? They cannot make you buy for a penny more than you want to pay, nor make you sell for a penny less.
All they can do is put liquidity pressure on you if your time preference is very high (you have to buy/sell RIGHT NOW or something bad happens). If you have low time preference there isn't a god damn thing those whales can do to you. 
You leave that buy/sell order open for as long as it takes. For example, I had some buy orders fill yesterday that I set 11 months ago. That's low time preference. I wanted to buy at $4k and I didn't care when.

Ok a couple things:
1) If what you're saying is true, that impacts the conclusion "satoshi has a lot of coins" but not "**somebody** has a lot of coins". The latter is still very meaningful to those trying to analyze the market. Do you believe there existed some early miner who mined at least hundreds of thousands of coins, and those coins were never spent?
2) I loaded sergio's data file into excel and graphed it myself. I'm not sure I understand your objection. I see a pattern early on where yes, the extranonce resets faster than it does weeks later, but the slope of the lines is exactly the same as it is later on. The slope afaict maps to hash rate (higher slope = more extranonces iterated through per unit time). So whoever it was in the first two weeks at least has the same hash rate as what you call "sergio's pattern". Isn't it at least plausible that whoever it was, maintained the same hash rate but didn't settle into a regular schedule of restarting his miner until a few weeks in?

Unless I'm missing something, this doesn't solve anything.
If the bitcoin is under your control, then it cannot be on the exchange's order books (so you cannot have an open limit order). If the bitcoin is under the exchange's control, then it can be stolen just like what happened to bitfinex.
AFAICT, all this does is make withdrawals a bit more convenient.

We should be able to estimate the number of exchange users, if you care to include people who use bitcoin as a unit of account, but don't actually hold any themselves. My wild-ass guess is that people who leave bitcoin on an exchange *far* outnumber people who hold it in their own wallet, by a factor of 5-10x. This is not surprising, since people who leave their money in banks far outnumber those who deal only in cash (in the developed world at least).
However, I think it's just as useful a metric to NOT count exchange users at all. As we've seen with bitfinex, many of those users may never actually get the bitcoin they think they're entitled to. So the number of real bitcoin users is somewhere in the neighborhood if 500k-1m.
You'd get the same discrepancy with gold. I'm sure the number of people who own gold on paper is far, far, higher than the number who hold gold physically.

Let's say satoshi is still around, still has access to the coins he mined, doesn't care about his creation at all anymore, and wishes to dump all his coins at once (which would crash the price to near-zero).
That will still not cause bitcoin to "collapse". There will simply be 1 million coins (or so) that will be absorbed by the market. The value of the network as a whole will remain unaffected.
Personally I would be thrilled if that happened because I have money on exchanges just waiting for price drops like this. This would be the mother of them all.
If satoshi just wanted to make money, he would not sell them all at once, there just aren't enough buyers at any one moment in time.

Nope, there's no way to do it. If you have any control at all, you can renege on your order and prevent it from executing afterward if you don't like the way the market moved. 
The only way to run a decentralized exchange is very slowly. High speed trading requires a central order book and pooled funds.

If by near term, you mean the next year, sure.
Markets are forward looking. If people think bitcoin will be valuable in the future, it will be valuable now.
That's why this market is so funny - everyone thinks bitcoin is dead, before that everyone thought it was the future of money, and before that they thought it was dead, and before that the future of money, etc etc.
Hint: it's the future of money, each time you are tricked into thinking it's dead, you missed out.

Let me paint a picture for you. Bitcoin IRC channel, summer 2011, mid bubble after the silk road wired article. I was new and asking questions about why the price had gone up so much (was around $20 at the time). A user responded: "It's going to 1000". Everyone in the channel laughed and called that delusional (and remember this was 2011, so it was nothing but OG bitcoiners there). Two years later it happened.
Then people called $10,000 delusional. It happened. Now they're calling $100k delusional. It will happen.
Now, once you get to $1m and beyond, that's as much due to the collapse of the dollar as it is to bitcoin's growth. But I believe there's a high chance that will also come to pass.

I am glad you brought up the internet. The internet was supposed to put the power of publishing information into everyone's hands. 
What did we end up with? Does everyone run their own website that they control and nobody can censor? Nope. That's still too hard, 20 years later. Everyone uses facebook. They gave up the power because they really didn't want it. They're too distracted to care about wielding this power themselves, they are happy to delegate it (which is what people do with everything else in the economy - pay someone else to do it).
With bitcoin you cannot pay someone else to do it, it defeats the entire purpose. So people are just not going to use it. I would really love to be wrong, it would be great if everyone became their own bank. But I could not be more confident that it will not happen. Some people will, most won't.

So you're saying this doesn't compare the cost of brute force, which is fair.
Let's say a lottery ticket costs $1. That'd be roughly $292m to get yourself a 50/50 chance of winning.
On the bitcoin side, let's take the most valuable key, holding 180,000 BTC. In order to steal that, I believe you don't have to guess the private key that was used. You only have to guess *a* private key whose public key whose RIPEMD-160 hash is the same as the address. To do that you have to search a 160-bit space, to guess with 50% probability you need to search 159 bit space.
Let's say it costs 1 dollar to search a trillion keys. Why, you'd only need 7x10^35 dollars to have a 50/50 shot! Unfortunately, economics breaks down here. You would not even be able to build a computer big enough to do this, because even harnessing 100% of the sun's power for the computation, it'd still take millions of years.

Having heard the word "bitcoin" doesn't mean you understand what it is. You're right that probably a billion people have heard the word. Less than a million know what it is. You might think that's low, but how many people understand it has zero supply elasticity (no matter how high the price goes, it can't be produced any faster) and that this has never existed in the history of the world? 
Almost nobody has really heard about bitcoin yet.

There is, because there is more than one property that makes up "good money". The most popular one might not be the best in all of them, paving the way for another to get a foothold. This is exactly what's happening with bitcoin against the dollar.
So there will likely be more than one, but there will be a very clear leader, a couple alternatives and thousands of worthless obscure shitcoins. The reason shitcoins will always exist: they cost basically nothing to create, even scamming a tiny proportion of people is profitable. Basically, it doesn't hurt to try, so people will try. And there will always be idiots that fall for scams - even old scams that you'd think everyone knows about.

Before we set about "fixing" inequality, we should talk about whether it's an actual problem.

That all changed, I'd argue, due to gains directly attributable to free trade and association. Do we really want to throw a monkey wrench into the works that produced these gains?
And it's not like billionaires actually spend billions of dollars on extravagances for themselves. Millions, sure, but it's a small fraction. It's worth it. Most of the "wealth" is tied up in investments that employ (and thus feed) tens of thousands of people.

There's no way GDAX can handle that kind of load, and has never produced even 1/10000th of that when i've been watching it.

My argument is that threats of violence (which is really what gives laws and regulations their weight) are massively overused and make inequality worse.

LN means you can pay much higher on-chain fees, because you only have to do it once, and then transact as many times as you want very cheaply.

Right now, all channel information is broadcast to all nodes. Since your node knows all the connections, it can figure out a route for itself. Then it wraps up the onion package and sends it on its way.
Obviously this is not ideal for scaling, but it will probably take LN a long way before a single node starts to buckle under the weight of tracking all the channels. I wouldn't be surprised if millions of channels was pretty easy to calculate a route from. It doesn't have to be the "ideal" route, just one that will work - so it will not be an exhaustive search by any means. edit: scaling further is an area of active research.
Personally I am more worried about the difficulty of creating an easy-to-use LN mobile app, than I am about routing.

Not really, prices just need to reflect the risks.

How much more would he have to write the check for, that you'd take it instead of $100 cash? Maybe $115?

It doesn't really matter, I'm sure there would be some market panic, but the market has panicked hundreds of times before and that wasn't the end of bitcoin then. It won't be for a PoW change either.
However I think it's highly unlikely we'll ever actually face an attack that can be ~~deterred by~~  defended with a PoW change. There are two kinds of 51% attacker - 1) That will attack on the original PoW algo but not the new one, 2) that will keep attacking on new PoW algo also. 
We can't do anything about 2. That's likely a state-level actor with resources so vast that bitcoin can do nothing in response except to shrink so much as to cease to be any sort of threat to that state.
I'd argue type 1 simply doesn't exist. What would be the point of it? It won't hurt bitcoin much and it'll cost a lot of money. The PoW change is a very simple code update whereas the attack will make hundreds of millions of dollars worth of mining equipment worthless. The countermeasure to this attack is so obvious and guaranteed that no one in their right mind would ever attempt the attack. (edit: unless they intend on continuing to attack on the new PoW algo).

Grin's being built as an altcoin, but I would imagine it's not impossible to do a version of it that begins with bitcoin's UTXO set. 
In that scenario, sure, all past movements would remain traceable forever since the bitcoin blockchain contains all that data, but as those UTXO's get spent they become untraceable. Until the last original UTXO is spent, it's not 100% fungible, but I think that would be good enough. Anyone that's worried about traceability can just move their funds.

PoS is a totally different security model (a worse one). 
I also think ASIC resistance is a fool's errand. PoW whose main sacrifice is electricity is far better than one whose main sacrifice is chip production (like memory-hard PoW). At least with electricity we can use cryptocurrency as a convenient power transport mechanism (mine BTC where there is excess power, and buy power where it is scarce). With memory hard PoW there's no such benefit.
I see no reason why chip production as PoW would be any less centralized than what we already have. There no way in hell that Nvidia is going to be the only player in that game for the long term. Chinese fabs will end up producing for those algos too.

DNS for bitcoin would be horribly insecure.
"Let's see, was his bitcoin handle 'jim.smith' or 'james.smith' or 'jamesSmith'" And if you get it wrong, your money is sent to a cybersquatter instead of your friend.
No, let's leave phishing and cybersquatting behind. DNS as a concept is over, a vestige from the days where the internet was just a bunch of geeks and low value sites. Too much money is involved now to rely on a universal, human readable name.
You already don't have to remember bitcoin addresses - have your friend send you an xpubkey, and put that in your addressbook.

It's going to be a long winter.
I think it's likely the next bull run will not occur until people like you (and me) start to have doubts. Right now I'm very confident. But I clearly remember early 2015 thinking we'd see double digits. 
The other thing that suggests to me that it's going to be a long winter, is that alts are still hilariously overvalued. When dumpster fires like TRON and IOTA are valued at close to a billion dollars, there's still a lot of fat to trim.
That said, anything could happen, but my policy is to assume normal bubble cycles until convinced otherwise, and I see nothing that suggests otherwise.
The standard scenario suggests low in the next 6-12 months (which may not be much lower than today), ATH in 2022 and peaking in 2023.

I'm sorry but you're not understanding.
One way or another you have to formally specify how to extract the watermark from the movie, for example in a computer program. 
If you distribute that program, you're distributing instructions for finding the watermark. If it is, for example, finding the numeral 7, then you can remove the watermark by altering the 7 until the tool doesn't recognize it anymore.
The whole problem is not how you watermark something, I'm sure that can be done in a way that's hard to detect. The problem is if you distribute a tool that detects it, then you're giving your attackers a tool that they can use to easily defeat the watermark.
Am I being clear now? I feel like I'm repeating myself.

I think this is a misconception. You don't need to know the innards that make your instant message get to its destination. But you DO need to know where you're putting your money, because money is itself an expression of preference. You cannot expect people to express preferences reliably when then don't understand what they're doing.
You'll end up with confused and frustrated users. "A 10,000 sat fee and up to one hour wait? I don't understand! I made a payment yesterday and it was totally instant and free! Why is this different?" And there's no possible way to explain this to them without explaining lightning vs on-chain. There's no possible method to abstract it away.

Good - aside from the ethical considerations, it's much better for me if the creditors get the coins back.
I expect them to be as stupid as they were in 2013 (leaving their coins on mtgox despite obvious red flags). That means as soon as they get the coins there's going to be a massive market dump as many of them rush for the exit at once.
I'll be there to scoop up those coins, perhaps the last ever 100k+ BTC supply glut. Maybe the selloff won't be quite that large, but I expect at least 50,000 coins to be dumped within a day or two of the distribution.

Hardware wallets are as good as you can get.
There's just as much trust involved in cold storage - if not more. You have to trust the hardware and software used to generate the key, and the hardware and software used to spend it. If any of those are compromised, you lose your money.
At least with a hardware wallet you're trusting 1 party not to attack you instead of up to 4.

I don't think computers were what was missing - most people who had them at the time did not use email. Mostly what was missing was dialup internet. And yes, that cost money, usually.
I was a university student at the time, and I had a free dialup account through the school, and they gave out email addresses. Of course the first people I emailed were my friends at other schools that had similar setups. I don't recall what year I was finally able to email anyone in my immediate family, it was at least 3-4 years later.

@_date: 2017-09-23 01:48:14
It doesn't exist, for good reason.
What will happen is fraudsters will show up with stolen credit card, buy something from you, and then later the banks will reverse the credit card payment when they find out it was fraudulent. So whoever converted it to bitcoin for you will lose both the fiat and bitcoin. Because of this, no one offers that service.
Generally you cannot buy bitcoin with a credit card. The places that do offer it, require more personal information to make sure they can track you down if you try to cheat. And even then they get a lot of fraud.

I never said bitcoin was too complicated, or that people were too dumb to use it.
I said they don't care. Censorship is not a problem in their lives that they want to solve.
Your view on fiat vs bitcoin is naive. A promise to pay bitcoin is just as inferior to bitcoin as a promise to pay dollars. The unit of account doesn't really matter if people are accepting paper versions of something instead of the actual thing. Of course with dollars, there is no actual thing anymore, promises to pay gold become promises of nothing. So your bank account is a promise to pay a promise to pay nothing.
Further, the unit of account also has nothing to do with the payment method. It's the payment method that has the censorship resistance. Cash dollars are censorship resistant, paypal dollars are not.

There's not much to discuss. There is no attack. I suppose you need to decide on a new algorithm, but honestly, the scenario is so bad to begin with that the smallest change that invalidates existing ASICs is fine. I believe ASIC resistance is folly. I would trust the developers to make a reasonable choice within a day, and I wouldn't be surprised if the code already existed but that fact is not publicized (for good reason).
PoW change is like executing all your soldiers. You don't do that just because you know some of them have the power to collude against you (but you have no evidence they intend to). All that does is a) makes the next wave of soldiers demand more pay for the same security, due to the obvious hazards. And bitcoin has a fixed budget so it'd end up with fewer soldiers and less security. b) makes them more careful to hide their ability to attack. Right now mining pools stamp their name on their blocks, they don't need to do that. If antpool wanted to appear to be 50 separate miners, they could, easily.

A payment that gets stuck halfway is simply a failed payment. The software should just try another route automatically, but i know this is still in development on some of the implementations (like c-lightning).
My personal experience a couple weeks ago buying stickers from blockstream was that I had to actually use a proposed patch that hadn't been integrated yet (now it has been). The issue was that the client would keep trying the same failed route every time you attempted it. The patch would mark that route failed, so that the next attempt would try a different one.
I had to try 6 times. Each time, I'd get a route that was at least 3 hops and at most 5. The one that finally worked I believe was 4 hops. But I was able to try them in quick succession, it only took a minute to get it through.
The goal is that a single command or button will do all that trying for me.

How do you "hack" bitcoin?
Bitcoin can have bugs, even exploitable ones. But basically as long as ECDSA algorithm is still working, those exploits can be corrected and the network moves forward without significant damage. If someone breaks ECDSA, then cryptography is broken all over the place and not just in bitcoin. Generally algorithms like that don't get broken all at once, they're steadily weakened over many years, and everyone's migrated to a new one by the time it's useless.

Spending when you otherwise don't want to spend just results in frivolous purchases and wasted value. That's exactly what you're doing by spending bitcoin when fiat will do just fine.

We are so early to the party, even earlier than most of us think.
In 1994, nearly everyone had heard of email, and almost none used it, and few were even curious about it. Anyone who actually had used it, saw its potential, but without a large user base, emails usefulness was somewhat crippled. Trying to convince others to use it was largely a waste of time. It would have been really easy to think "well, this is just going to die off, nobody cares".
But it did catch on, mostly because if you had to get someone a written message fast, email was the cheapest and fastest way, and once someone tried it, the superiority was undeniable.
Bitcoin will do the same. It's not the same as email exactly - email's superiority was immediately obvious to those who tried it whereas bitcoin's security is not immediately obvious. On the other hand, benefiting from email *requires* that people you know also use it. That is not the case with bitcoin.

You mean like how gold is now worthless because nobody uses it in daily transactions?
@_date: 2016-09-16 19:43:36
That's not how it works.
The bankers turn on the printing press of promises (that they create for free). At first they redeem the promises for a commodity, to anyone who asks. This helps convince the people that the promises themselves have value. 
Then they slowly break the connection. First they redeem 1:1. Then 2:1. Then 10:1. Then 35:1. Then they simply stop redeeming at all. By then the people are well accustomed to using the promise as money. No one kicks up any fuss. Then the bankers have all the commodity and the people have worthless promises that are entirely controlled by the bankers.
This is exactly what happened with gold in 1971.
@_date: 2016-09-08 17:25:08
So you're comparing the cost of fiat banking with no censorship resistance, to bitcoin with censorship resistance? That's hardly fair. If you remove paper cash, then you must have permission from the bank to perform any transaction.


Of course it matters, you just explained why. A block reward of 1 with 1m btc already mined is exactly the same as a block reward of 10 with 10m btc already mined. So the absolute value of the block reward doesn't matter, only its proportion to the total amount mined.

I was at first thinking the same as you, but I have reconsidered.

That's like $1.50 of capital gains you'd technically owe that the IRS would have no possible way to know that you owe. If you want to pay what you owe but don't want to do the accounting you can probably just fill in whatever you want.

The "no compromise" attitude is completely justified. They have broad support, and if they did compromise, that would not end the attempts to subvert bitcoin - in fact it would encourage them. They would immediately be asked to "compromise" again, and again, until censorship-resistant bitcoin is dead.
How can people still not get it after the China ban? Bitcoin has to resist future attacks, not just ones that have already occurred. That means bitcoin has to work in China even when the Chinese government is trying to block it. 2x doesn't completely prevent bitcoin from working there, but it makes it that much harder.
@_date: 2017-09-18 15:07:11
Bitcoin *is* a niche crypto geek project. I personally think it will always be a niche product, but it will spread from "geeks who disobey authority" to "non-geeks who disobey authority".

You'd have to have a lot of serious restrictions on where and what you can trade for that to be your strategy.
You need to trade at least one paycheck behind, so that you have a buffer. Instant buys for nontrivial amounts just don't exist, due to the severe fraud risk of accepting reversible fiat payments.

It does nothing to solve the issues I pointed out.
What namecoin does is give you uncensored access to the name (the FBI cannot seize your domain name). It still has all the same problems any universal human readable naming system does. (Namely, that people easily use the wrong name - either by mistake or deliberate attack - and that leads to very expensive mistakes).
The solution (IMO) is forget universal names. If you want to name a long gobbledygook key for future use, just put in your local address book. If you want to point someone else to that key, just send it to them and they can name it however they want.

Yeah, the argument (IMO) isn't that you should invest even if you believe the expected value is negative. It's that you're wrong, it's not negative :)
I mean, honestly, I don't see how anyone can think it's negative right now.
Bitcoin has been through ~4 cycles of expansion already and hasn't died. Either this is the last cycle and it's dying, or there's another cycle.
If there's another cycle, your expected returns are roughly 1000%. To have a negative expected value, the odds of another cycle would have to be less than 10%. 
I don't see how anyone can rationally argue that the odds of bitcoin entering another expansion cycle is less than 10%. I think it's hard to even argue it's less than 50%.
Edit: and really, the expected returns if there's another cycle are higher than 1000%. Historically, from bear market to next peak is closer to 10,000%.
Of course, in general past performance doesn't mean anything. But for bitcoin in particular, there's good reason to think it hasn't nearly reached its speculative end.

But I'd just be making a really shitty version of Electrum, which I already have and it works very well.

I think PoW change is not warranted, and won't be until there's a 51% attack or something of that seriousness. Stay the course until there's a real reason to change it. I'm not saying we can't have a hard fork **coded**, in case of emergency, but there's no emergency now and there is no pressing reason to think there will be.
Here's why I think PoW change now is a long term setback - a new PoW algorithm will be fundamentally no different than the current one. There simply doesn't exist an algorithm that favors commodity computers or small miners. I know what you're going to say "but memory-hard algos!" No. That favors memory chip manufacturers the exact same way that SHA256 favors ASIC manufacturers. "But my 32gb will be worth something!" No, it won't. Difficulty will quickly make your measly 32gb as worthless for mining as your measly CPU is now.
We actually have hope on the horizon for re-decentralization of mining - heat dissipation. The theory being that home miners can re-use most of the heat produced by mining, where datacenters cannot. If we change algos now (esp to memory-hard algos), we'll either delay that re-decentralization or make it impossible.

That's never going to happen. Large companies are never going to invest in bitcoin, just like none of them hold gold today. Best case scenario they keep part of their operating budget in bitcoin, but honestly I don't see any reason why they would. These are regulated companies that can't really get away with disobeying authorities, they are too high profile. So they cannot use bitcoin to bypass regulation or censorship. It would just attract more regulatory pressure.
The only organizations that would directly benefit from bitcoin are those who are already disobeying authorities (or are willing to). Wikileaks for example.

There's no way to decide what is "spam" and what isn't, because one person's spam is another's important business. If the transaction is valid and pays what miners are willing to accept, it gets in. That's what censorship resistance is. Filtering out transactions is censorship.
Regarding fees, you can ignore any transactions paying less than you. Let's say you're in line at a food truck to get a hot dog, and you're 3rd in line. Then 50,000 people get in line behind you. Does that affect if or when you'll get your food? Nope. You can ignore everyone behind you.

That's just another way of saying "you can sell it to whoever wants to pay for it".
Gold, salt, bananas, bitcoin. All the same.
While it's true bitcoin arguably doesn't have another use besides money, that has no bearing whatsoever on its price, which is always "what others are willing to pay for it".
The reason people want to pay for gold is not that "I can always sell it for pennies on the dollar to an electronics firm". They pay for gold because they believe others will want to buy it for its non-electronic properties.
Same with bitcoin. People want to buy it because it can be thought of as a metal that can be instantly transported any distance, and can be carried undetectably and unstoppably, anywhere.

It only gets a bit difficult when you have enough coin to bother with real security.
If you have $100 of bitcoin, just use a mobile wallet. If it's too much trouble to find a safe place to backup your seed, then just don't bother. It's not worth spending a bunch of time and effort.
If you have over $20k worth, then you absolutely should have a hardware wallet. It's a snap to set up, the only pain is finding a safe place to back up your seed. For larger amounts, I suggest ordering tamper-evident hologram stickers from amazon ($10), put in an envelope, seal it up, and put it in a bank safe deposit box ($50/yr). That's a one time setup, takes maybe 1-2 hours of your time.
Be wary when bitcoin price skyrockets, it may very quickly put you into a new category where you need more security.

Leaving aside whether I think he really believes what he says (I don't), it's a good point but honestly it's overstated.
Bitcoin does have the power to undermine the war machine, but only if most of the population chooses to wield that power. I think it's pretty obvious that most of the population obeys authority and is supportive (in varying degrees) of the war machine.
There is a conversation that most people simply refuse to have, and refuse to think about. To me it boils down to a very simple question (a variant of the trolley problem):


Presumably one end of the spectrum is "zero" (you would not interfere at all). Another common answer is "one" (you have slight preference for your own countrymen, but not enough to increase the overall destruction to save them).
Unfortunately, I believe that at least 30% of America would put that number in the thousands or millions (they'd be willing to kill thousands of foreigners to save one American life). I think for certain foreigners, the answer would be "all of them".
This 30+% of America views foreigners as essentially sub-human and expendable.
Bitcoin can do absolutely nothing to change that.

If it was testnet only, **nobody would be testing it**.

I have talked with this group at IBM and quite frankly they didn't seem like they know what they're doing.
The dumbest idea I heard was that they were going to offer their blockchain as a cloud service. "Use a blockchain so you can verify everything yourself, except you won't verify anything yourself because you've outsourced it all to us!" What the is the point of that? Is IBM seriously going to have 1000 instances of these nodes all telling their cloud customers the same thing? If nodes are not economically independent there's no point in having more than one. Maybe they're really only going to have one but not tell their customers that, I don't know. It's either pointless or a scam, you tell me.
One of their use cases was to track shipping goods through multiple jurisdictions and their customs. That is less wrong, but I still believe that tracking anything but native tokens in a blockchain is pointless. Blockchains cannot enforce anything except on their native tokens (they can record the ownership change of a car, but they cannot enforce it, as they have no power in the physical world). If you're leaving enforcement to some international court of law, that's a trusted third party, and you'd probably be just as well off using some other dedicated trusted third party and sparing yourself all the blockchain headache.

This doesn't really address LN at all. It IS true that once you open a channel, you can make as many no-fee txs with it as you want (well, there are separate and much smaller fees for routing, but they don't go to miners). 
Electricity cost per tx is just not a relevant thing on the bitcoin network - not really at the base layer and certainly not when you include LN.
As the subsidy decreases, all that matters is that the price of bitcoin goes up to compensate. It's possible to screw it up by making the max block size too large (and thus an oversupply of block space that nobody bids up to sufficient level to secure the network). However I think that if the block size stays roughly proportional to price from here on out, the blocks won't be too large. It's hard to tell exactly what the ideal block size is to maximize fees, because the miners can always game that metric.

If you were serious about this, you should have bought some at the current price. Even 10% of your funds. Just in case the bottom is already in (which perhaps it isn't, but who knows).
If you haven't bought any yet, I suspect what you're going to do is keep pushing down your buy in price such that you never buy any. Even after the bottom has come and gone, you'll keep waiting for another dip that will never come.
You have to pull the trigger sometime, and accept the fact that you aren't going to catch the exact bottom. Spread out your buys so that you aren't left with zero bitcoin in the event that your prediction is wrong.

However it's simply not a replacement for bitcoin. China's system will be inevitably controlled by the Chinese government, which means they control which transactions are blocked or reversed, inflation, seizure of funds etc. All the things that bitcoin protects against, there's no such protection in any system the Chinese government would want.

Well, it makes sense, right?
If blocks aren't full, then the fee spammers are competing with is zero (the space left in the block has zero fees bidding for it). 
I think the issue here is that most people are actually willing to pay a LOT more for transactions than they've been paying. So they've basically been getting a great deal, and then when it becomes not so great anymore, they howl as if they've been slighted. "You used to give me transactions for 5 cents! Why is it 50 now??" (Even though they'd still pay the fee if it was $5).
If the price is less than or equal to what you're willing to pay, you're getting what you want. Some people have simply not had to think about what they're willing to pay until recently (because the market rate has been so far below it that they haven't sweated it at all).

If you're keeping secret keys on a windows computer, IMO it is hopeless. You'll never know if there's malware on it or not.
Depends on how much bitcoin you have. If it's like $100 worth, honestly don't bother. You lose it, you lose it. Don't waste hours trying to secure your computer, that time is worth more than your bitcoin.
You could try a mobile wallet, that's probably a bit more secure.

Yes, but if you were to ask "what's the biggest flaw of the internet" in 1992, usability would be a big one then too. There was no gmail then, setting up email was a pain in the ass and there was no explanation for nontechnical people.
Sure, part of the difficulty was that people didn't even know the concepts, and they eventually learn. But some concepts can be abstracted away (most people don't know what an SMTP or IMAP server is, even though they're using it, but they did still need to learn about email addresses and attachments etc).
edit: if i were to guess at what parts of bitcoin will be abstracted away, I'd have to say base58 style addresses will be gone in the future (still there under the covers, but web of trust layer will be built to give human-readable names to xpubkeys or something similar). Confirmations and fee estimation will probably be gone and hidden behind lightning network or similar.

They're not mining at all. That's their own choice.
Edit: by that I mean, I run bitcoin core, I will see no blocks at all mined by them, if they're mining 2x. It's the same as if they switched to an altcoin. It's not an attack unless they're mining blocks that YOUR client sees as valid.
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:50:39


That doesn't make any sense.
HODLing just means "not for sale". It has nothing to do with the bid side of the order book, for that you need fiat. If a whale is holding bitcoin, all they can do is sell it (unless they borrow fiat on margin). As a hodler, you cannot affect the bid side of the order book at all.
For the ask side, hodling is basically the same as an ask order for a million each. It means less liquidity on that side, making it easier for a whale WITH FIAT to push the price up.

It's not really an equation. It's more like "whoever proves that they flipped a coin and got heads, X times in a row". Where X these days is an enormous number like 10^21.

Bitcoin is not a magic "get rich" machine.
The people who got rich did so by putting money into it when everyone was telling them they'd never see it again. And then they made some good money and *still* didn't sell because they were so confident about bitcoin's future.
People who are betting on bitcoin now, the chances that they'll lose it all are way lower than 5 years ago. Lower risk, lower reward.

Obligatory 
Do not feel guilty about not "supporting" merchants who accept bitcoin. If their business model depends on the goodness of customers' hearts, it's broken. If they want your bitcoin, they have to earn it.
Quite frankly, I think it's completely impractical for companies like Overstock to accept bitcoin. I mean, sure, it's a nice political statement. But who actually needs censorship resistant payments to buy bedsheets? Nobody. Nobody is trying to stop anyone from buying bedsheets. I suppose it's nice for the unbanked to be able to participate, but let's face it, that's a tiny tiny market for a company like Overstock. Empirical evidence bears this out. A tiny fraction of their customers pay with bitcoin. When you subtract the ones who used bitcoin just to show support, (leaving only people who have no other choice except bitcoin), what's left is completely negligible.
It's absolutely fine to keep your bitcoin stashed away for occasions when you actually need it.

It's going to be impractical I think unless OP can remember at least one word and find the word list used to generate the password.
Given 26 characters (and it would help if OP knew whether the passphrase put spaces between the words, let's say they did), and the word list:
Let's say there were 5 words from a 4096 word list, that's 60 bits (impractical to brute force). However eliminating all combinations that add up to anything but 26 characters should reduce that. It should knock off about 4 bits (56), and if OP knows specifically that no words were repeated, it would knock off a little more.
That's still in the quadrillions of combinations to try. However remembering one word would knock off 12 bits (44), that gets you down to 16 trillion. I'm not sure how fast dave's machines can try combinations, but it is within the realm of possibility. Still might be a bit of a stretch for 9.5 btc. Any further info OP can remember would help a bunch.
Probably best for OP to scan his drive really carefully for every single image to look for the screenshot.(take a full backup first). If that fails then try to remember anything about the password.

Now bitcoin comes and threatens to pierce that protective bubble, exposing them to the environment that's gotten more challenging while they've just gotten fat and weak. 
I smell the desperation they feel to latch onto anything they think will keep them relevant. They think "blockchain" will be a miracle shot of steroids that will whip them into shape before they're thrust into the real world. We all know it won't.

Sergio's blog post seems pretty compelling, I'm curious what your objection is. Do you doubt that the same entity mined all those coins (in other words there's some flaw in the analysis technique)?
Or do you accept that part but doubt that the entity being analyzed is satoshi? To me, the fact that satoshi disappeared and the coins have never moved, seems to strongly suggest they are his. To say otherwise it seems like you'd need to believe that someone else showed up at block 1, and also disappeared.

That's just another way of saying "you can sell it to whoever wants to pay for it".
Gold, salt, bananas, bitcoin. All the same.
While it's true bitcoin arguably doesn't have another use besides money, that has no bearing whatsoever on its price, which is always "what others are willing to pay for it".
The reason people want to pay for gold is not that "I can always sell it for pennies on the dollar to an electronics firm". They pay for gold because they believe others will want to buy it for its non-electronic properties.
Same with bitcoin. People want to buy it because it can be thought of as a metal that can be instantly transported any distance, and can be carried undetectably and unstoppably, anywhere.

As has been true throughout bitcoin history, a good portion of all new entrants have no idea what they're doing. They were hoping to get rich quick by hopping on the bandwagon. All those people are panic selling now.
On the one hand, you'd think the price history would easily show that panic selling has never been a good idea. On the other hand, the number of people buying into bitcoin with no knowledge of it whatsoever is probably higher now than 5 years ago. Wouldn't be surprised if a lot of buyers have never looked at the price history.

What do you call the escrow service in the altcoin you mention? That's a middleman - they decide whether the transaction is reversed.
A payment system where the sender can unilaterally reverse a payment is useless. Would you ever accept a payment like that? That's not really a payment at all if the sender can simply take it back without your permission. If it was time-bound, then you still could not realistically consider it "paid" until that time expired (after which it is irreversible).

If China didn't attack bitcoin, then bitcoin has failed. The only reason for a government like China's NOT to attack bitcoin is because it poses no threat. 
The good news is that it *does* pose a threat. Bitcoin is working.
It will be interesting to see whether Chinese people are still interested in holding bitcoin. So far it looks like they are (they didn't all dump). Kind of makes sense, does it? Imagine bitcoin exchanges were shutting down in your country and there were capital controls in place. What discount would you need to buy it anyway (and solve the problem of selling it for profit later)? It's probably not that big of a discount for well-connected people.

That has no bearing on the problem of "deep fakes", whatsoever.
There is only one solution, really - have video cameras digitally sign videos as they're recorded. Then if they are altered, the signature will be invalid.
That's not foolproof of course - camera companies might collude to produce the fakes, or their keys may get stolen. 
But timestamping does not solve this problem - it tells you only that "this video definitely existed at this time and if someone claims it's newer, they're lying". That's a totally different issue.

Ok here's how this works:
You have $1000 of disposable income that you wish to use for "dip buying".
1) Deposit that $1000 to gdax NOW
2) Wait for it to arrive
3) Place limit orders at whatever you think your "dip" price is
4) Update limit orders as you see fit
5) When dip happens below your order, you have your coins
6) withdraw coins
The only possible reason I can think of that you would not deposit that $1000 now, is because you do not have $1000 to spend on bitcoin. In which case you are investing more than you can afford to lose, which you should not be doing.
@_date: 2018-02-26 14:57:17
Depends on what "use" means. 
For non-technical people who just want 2nd layer easy payments, this is correct, they should wait.
For technical people who want to try out the new technology, report on problems they find, and are willing to lose whatever small amounts they put in the channel, it's ready and I think this should be encouraged. I bought some stickers from blockstream using lightning, and it was quite difficult. But I ended up contributing some bug reports and docs changes that would not have happened if I'd listened to posts like this.

You don't need anyone's permission, there's code you can run, on mainnet right now. Hundreds of people already have.
HOWEVER, it's buggy and really not ready for end-users. I tried 3 times to buy stickers with LN from Blockstream's store, and it failed every time and the funds are going to be difficult to retrieve. It wasn't much money though, and I knew that might happen, so I'm cool with it. But others have gotten it to work.
I would think LN on desktop should be usable sometime this year. Mobile will take longer.
@_date: 2018-02-24 19:19:55
I don't understand, you took this photo months ago? Why?
Given the amounts there (appears to be less than $1000 worth) and the legal wrangling it would take to retrieve the money, it may not even be worth it.
It can't hurt to contact binance and ask them what documentation they would need to give you control of the account. However I expect you may get no reply at all, or if you do, they'll ask for information you don't have, or legal documents that cost more to have drawn up and sent than the account is worth. So I'd contact their support but I wouldn't be too optimistic about that account.
However it's entirely possible there is other cryptocurrency besides what is on binance. Your best bet is to find someone familiar with cryptocurrency that you can trust, to go over your cousin's computer and find whatever might be there (which may be nothing). Do not let strangers from the internet get ahold of any information from that computer, because that could lead to them stealing the money.
You should also try to get access to his email, and check for emails from other exchanges where he might have had accounts that might also have a balance.

They can't convert your bt1 to bitcoin before the fork. Right now all there is to withdraw is pre-fork coins. You can't withdraw only one side, because there is no split in the chain yet. All you can do is recombine the bt1 and bt2 tokens into a pre-split bitcoin and withdraw that. But that just basically undoes the original split, unless the price ratio has changed significantly since you split it.

They've never batched any of my withdrawals.
I've seen a 1 input, 4 output, however it was clear that the other outputs were going back to coinbase (they were all the same, even amount that I've seen as inputs to other withdrawals of mine).
Even the way coinbase does non-batch withdrawals looks brain-dead to me. I've gotten withdrawal txs with 40 inputs that paid $300 in fees. There's no way in hell they should ever have 40 inputs.

Yes, 51% attacking the original chain is possible. It'd quickly result in a PoW change. But I'd still follow the original chain, mostly because the 2x client has one developer who has already left to work on some scamcoin and can't properly rebase the 2x code onto core's 0.15.

If you convert in the wallet, there's no guarantee that the conversion rate used exactly matches that of the merchant you're paying. Then you'll end up with problems where merchant wants $29.99 but gets $29.87, and then has to decide whether to accept the loss or not.
If you're sending bitcoin it needs to be denominated in bitcoin. Wallets can show equivalent prices, and in fact many already do (electrum, mycelium, etc).

I don't want to be a hater, but I don't see the point of bisq.
There's no privacy options for the fiat side of the transfer. So AFAICT, your trade is never private and you might as well used a centralized exchange.
In both cases, there's a third party who knows who the first two parties are. For example, using Square cash: Square knows who sent a fiat payment and who received it. I suppose there's a minor benefit of square not knowing what the payment was for. But the drawback of almost zero liquidity and much higher risk than an exchange, is way too much to stomach for this minor benefit.

One easy way is to move the coins and report them stolen. Impossible to prove you still control them, and then you have as long as you need to mix them. If it's not a vast sum the police are never going to even pursue it.

15% hashpower is not "frozen". Let's say you hold 1000 btc and don't wish to be intimidated. So you go to dump 2x even though blocks are only 1 per hour. Fees are sky high, $500! Will you pay the fee so that you can sell your 2x coin for at least 150 btc? Of course! The $500 fee is peanuts. And the whole reason the fees are so high is because other large holders are rushing to dump their 2x also. 
In short either fees are enormous because of massive 2x dumping, or bitcoin continues to work fine with 15% hashpower.
2x cannot win with just miners and a couple of companies who aren't even acting in holders' interests.

Bitcoin is really hard to fully understand because it's not just software, because the system depends on humans behaving a certain way. One of the most important is that it depends on miners acting in their own economic self interest. 
However, for miners to figure this out what exactly their best economic strategy is, is non-trivial. It's not surprising that they are making mistakes (more accurately, blunders). They will learn. The failure of 2x will be a good teaching moment. Unfortunately this lesson will come with a big dose of humility so I don't expect it to go down smoothly. Miners can't fight reality though, they'll have to accept it eventually, that they do not set the rules of bitcoin.

Are you asking whether it's possible to have a fractional reserve bank account denominated in bitcoin? In that case the answer is yes. The only difference between that and regular bitcoin exchange accounts is the fractional reserve part (which we don't even know whether exchanges are full reserve or not, they're just supposed to be).
Or are you asking whether the principles of cryptocurrency remain when you use those kinds of accounts? In that case the answer is no. All of the censorship resistance is gone - the bank can block or reverse your transactions, seize your money, and it can inflate the money supply arbitrarily.
So yes, it's possible, but there is limited use cases. You'd only use it if you think the third party risk is not as bad as the risk from your own technical ineptness. There may be a narrow use case where the bitcoin bank account has cheaper transactions, although I expect things like Lightning Network to make those uses extremely narrow.

There is no reason to believe coinbase will give you the same address twice. However you should be able to assume that **any** address you've ever seen there belongs to your account and you'll be credited with any bitcoin you send to those addresses.
So just because you went to coinbase later and saw a different address, doesn't mean your coins were stolen.
You should be able to look at your wallet history, get the address where the coins were sent, and find out from coinbase whether that address belongs to them. However, coinbase support is notoriously bad, and I'm not sure it's possible to get this information directly from the website.

I'm sorry but $1 for an unstoppable and irreversible transaction is insanely cheap. The problem is a lot of people are just fucking around with bitcoin and don't care about censorship resistance.

This is the oft-repeated advice, but I counter with: don't bother.
If there's no direct benefit to you to pay with bitcoin, then don't. Generally it's the exact opposite - it hurts you to pay with bitcoin. Merchants like Overstock or Newegg offer no discount, and the payment is irreversible. You're depending on the merchant to return the money to you in case of dispute. They accept reversible payments, so use them instead. 
The merchants *should* be valuing the irreversibility of bitcoin, but they don't! Once that bitcoin is in their wallet, no one can snatch it back, unlike Visa payments. You'd think that would be worth something to them. But look at their prices, the bitcoin discount is zero. 
You should not support this business model. It is normalizing something that shouldn't be normal. Cash is worth more than a check because it is lower risk. And yet, all over the world prices are the same for cash and check. This should not be the case, don't help perpetuate it.

No, the only transactions that are necessary are those needed to support speculation.
Right now all that matters is grabbing up as much bitcoin as possible. Focusing on doing stuff with bitcoin will usually result in you having less of it, so that is not a good idea.
Eventually, bitcoin will reach the end of speculation - at a valuation that gobbles up today's gold and savings accounts combined, and then just keeps going, before settling back into its store of value role. That's the time to think about talking to merchants. Believe me, even when bitcoin is at the moon, most merchants will STILL not give a shit about it. They couldn't care less how they're paid, they'll just take whatever their customers want to use. As long as there's shitty money to dump on merchants, that's what I'm going to use. My bitcoin stays in my wallet, and isn't moving except in cases where I'm trying to acquire more.

Yes, peak speculation will happen when it becomes fairly obvious what's coming. It'll still be a while before it actually happens.
Personally I think what's coming is complete takeover of gold and broad money (meaning savings accounts, cds, etc). That's a roughly 90 trillion dollar market. Keep in mind ~3million btc are lost so total supply is about 18 million. That is a valuation of $5 million per bitcoin.
Of course that is not a sure thing, but current prices put the odds at 625 to one. I think that's hugely underestimated. 
Here's why bitcoin is preferable to broad money:
1) Unseizable, no need to trust a custodian
2) Savings accounts and CDs rarely beat inflation. Bitcoin doesn't have inflation (or at least, it won't be significant by the time it matters).
3) Near instant transfer to anyone, anywhere
Really the only major barrier left is to put the potential for altcoin flippenings to bed. Volatility and trust in new tech are things that will take care of themselves as bitcoin grows.

You cannot prove you don't know something, that is impossible.

That would not help except against stupid thieves who run off before confirmation. Spending ahead of them is just going to get you shot.

Miners resolve conflicting transactions. That's all. They don't set the rules. They can censor though if they work together (or one party dominates the mining power).
Users can fire the miners (make their specialized hardware worthless by changing the type of proof required such that the existing hardware can't generate it efficiently). However this is of limited effectiveness against a state willing to spend huge amounts on an attack.
Ultimately Bitcoin depends on the fact that miners profit more by being honest than attacking. It can't really resist a deep pocketed attacker who doesn't care about profit.

"flow back into the economy" is irrelevant because we're already modeling the entire economy.
Imagine there's just one bank and one person, Joe. Bank creates $100, loans it to joe at 5% interest. There is only $100 of money in the economy. Joe cannot pay back the interest because the money to pay it back DOES NOT EXIST! Where is he supposed to get $105 when there is only $100 in existence?
Without defaults, the gap between what exists, and what must be paid back, can only grow. You can add more banks and people to the mix, all you're doing is making that gap even bigger.
The only way out is default. What the banks do with their interest payments is completely irrelevant.

I really wish people would stop talking about "possession" of data being illegal. I'm aware of these laws, but they're idiotic and arbitrary, and it's just going to become increasingly difficult to pretend they're not. The number of contortions that have to be made to store kiddie porn in the blockchain is pretty high, but it can be done. It can always be done - with special procedures to encode and decode.
There's no such thing as possession of data. If I have an encrypted image, but not the key, do I really "have" the data? What if it's not "encrypted" per se, just requires an interpreter program that I don't have?
It all will boil down to proving intent. And with this objection to Factom of course there is no intent.
You could just as well point to ANY data and accuse its host of hosting child porn, because, there is some arbitary interpreter that could interpret it as child porn.

Buy orders all the way down from here to 3000. It may go lower, I'll possibly add more buy orders later.
Rationale - The 1200 peak in 2013 was artificially high due to fraud at mtgox. I don't think there's any fraud that rampant happening recently, so I don't think we'll see anything like 1200-&gt;200 (equivalent would be 4980-&gt;830). Seems plausible to revisit 2000 though.
It's going to be a while before there's good news about segwit and all the features it enables. So there's lots of room to fall still. The market is still full of traders who have absolutely no idea what they bought.

Yes, it does. *Some* machine has to do the computation to produce a signature from your private key and the transaction details. It better be yours, because whichever machine does it can take your bitcoin - so it should be one you trust not to do that (your own).
Even within your own machine, some methods are safer than others. Using a platform like a browser that is security swiss-cheese is not a good idea. When using web wallets like blockchain.info, it is indeed your browser that is doing the signing. Meaning web-based malware can grab your private keys. It's better to use a native wallet than a web wallet, and it's better still to use a hardware wallet.

I think my issue is with voting pools of size 3/5 or 7/10. Getting 7 parties to collude is just not that hard. If there's hundreds of millions of dollars at stake, collusion becomes very lucrative.  Remember, "we got hacked" is indistinguishable from "we stole the money", even in a voting pool.
If the pool is 7000/10000, then it becomes a lot safer, because if there's any attempt at collusion at all, there's very likely multiple attempts pulling in different directions. 
But there just isn't going to be a voting pool with 10,000 independent members. At least, no one has described a scenario where that would happen.

One objection to deflationary currency is, "why should someone get richer just by doing nothing with their money?"
Sounds reasonable, right?
Except we need to define "doing nothing". What is the difference between investing in the entire economy by holding deflationary currency, and investing in the entire economy by holding a "whole market" stock fund?
There's not much difference. Neither one takes any thought or effort. 
In either case, you hold and when the economy grows, you gain. If the economy shrinks, you lose. The difference is, managing a whole-market fund is complex and expensive, and is inaccessible to the unbanked. A deflationary currency is accessible.

No, no one with money secured in the chain should care what miners think. They're hired to do a job, they can either do it, or not do it. Any individual miner who doesn't like the rules the community has chosen can simply leave anytime he wants and mine something else, or not mine anything.


No it doesn't. It can keep working forever at the current scale. Of course, no one is saying it will have 2mb blocks forever, pretty much everyone agrees that the current node costs are fine. So as hardware and bandwidth get cheaper, on-chain capacity will increase.
Plus, there is off-chain capacity. I just sent my first lightning network transactions, it works.
Think about this - how much stuff do you buy every day that you actually *need* on-chain transactions for? It would have to be something that some authority is trying to prevent you from doing it. Almost nobody has this requirement very often. The demand for on-chain scaling simply isn't there. I see no reason why hardware improvements, 2nd layers like LN, and bitcoin banks like coinbase will not be sufficient for the entire world's transactions.

I only narrowly avoided it because I stopped to think for a few seconds, and then it hit me - the absurdity of having to send someone money before I could get money back.

Merchants must necessarily be the very last on board. You might convince business owners to *invest* in bitcoin, but simply accepting it as payment (and trading it away immediately) is a waste of time.
You're talking to some low level grunt here, the best you can do is convince them personally to invest their savings in bitcoin. You aren't going to do that by telling them you want to get rid of your bitcoin (by spending it at their merchant's shop).

I agree.
Bitcoin, by being first, is unique in that it was a "fair start" and none of the coins since seem to be able to replicate that. 
Offering proof-of-work still doesn't prevent pump-and-dump. The problem is the new coins are too similar to bitcoin and can't overcome its network effects. Fortunately the public is now sophisticated enough to recognize a straight up bitcoin clone, and now demands at least some substantial change or tradeoff, like cryptonote.

Not really. Coins that never moved since 2010 or 2011? They've appreciated ten million percent or so. While it is certainly reasonable to expect *some* hodlers from that era, it's completely absurd to think that anywhere near a majority would still be deliberately waiting. Nearly all those coins haven't moved because they can't.
Then there's satoshi's coins, he may or may not have the keys, but clearly he values his anonymity. I think it's unlikely the many coins that are easily linked to him will ever be spent. He would likely have coins that nobody knew were his, and either spent them or will spend them.

Bitcoin makes coins obsolete. It is not helpful to continue to use that analogy. Every single reason that coins exist, does not apply to bitcoin.
The denomination of a bitcoin (100 million satoshis) does absolutely nothing to make "a bitcoin" easier to authenticate. Any amount is as easy to authenticate as any other.

That's not why. They'd accept it no problem if it meant more customers.
The problem is that bitcoin is increasing in value so fast that it makes no sense to do anything with it except hold it. This phase will eventually end, but until then, asking merchants to accept bitcoin is largely a complete waste of time. (Exceptions would be where censorship resistance matters).

Simple example to demonstrate: If you have $1000, out of $1m existing in the world, you own 1/1000th of all dollars. If the government can't pay its debt of $1m and chooses to print it instead, the money supply increases to $2m. At that point you own 1/2000th of all dollars. That's precisely the same thing as the government seizing half your bank account ($500, leaving you with $500, or 1/2000th of the money supply).
Printing is equivalent to stealing an equal percentage of everyone's holdings.

I don't really expect that people will be using "raw" bitcoin directly with merchants, 10 years from now. There's simply no reason to use a censorship-resistant payment network to buy socks or coffee. It's overkill.
I think it will be some semi-trusted payment network that's cheaper and faster than Visa - cheaper because it actually uses legitimate security instead of the 1950's bullshit that today's CC's use.
However I see no reason why that semi-trusted payment network wouldn't support the bitcoin unit of account.

Different fundamental approaches made different tradeoffs. The reason you can't have one word processor or one programming language for everyone, that's superior in every way, is because it's usually just not possible.
Without completely new technology, there will be no cryptocurrency that is superior to bitcoin in every way, it will just make different tradeoffs. The set that bitcoin picked were pretty darn reasonable, not perfect. 
If I were dismissing Litecoin's faster block time as a defect, I would have said it was a defect. It's not, it's just a different tradeoff that at best, gives a very slight advantage.

Another idea (not mutually exclusive) is to not give away your bitcoin balance in the first place. Then all you need is plausible deniability - a Trezor with multiple accounts would do it.
Granted it is technically challenging to avoid leaking your true assets in your various transactions. For example, you can't have 10,000 bitcoin sitting in one address, and then buy something on Newegg for 0.1btc and send the change back to yourself. That tells Newegg you have 10,000 bitcoin and then they could tell the 3-letter agencies. You would have to slowly split up your stash into multiple outputs, such that nobody could be sure if they were real transactions with other parties, or you just splitting your stash.
This also only works if your bitcoin savings are quite large relative to your lifestyle. You can't have yachts and ferraris and expect anyone to believe you have no cash.

There are some ways in which bitcoin does not parallel the internet.
Internet is a great censorship resistant tool, and early on perhaps it was known only for that. However the internet is a superior mode of communication in nearly every way, whether you need it to be censorship resistant or not.
Bitcoin, unfortunately, has to make more tradeoffs. It's great for censorship resistance, but it is not a superior payment system in every way. It's slow and expensive. (Yes I realize CC payments take months to settle, but that's a matter of policy, not technology - the tech could do it instantly if irreversible payments is what they wanted). 
If you don't need a payment to be censorship resistant, then there often isn't a very compelling reason to use bitcoin. Hence, the perception that it is "a den for hackers and thieves" is sort of true. It's a den for censorship avoiders, many of which are considered "hackers and thieves" by **some authority**.  But are all those authorities benevolent? No.

It's pretty easy to figure out.
We know what typical home power costs are. We know roughly what efficiency the miner chip will run at. We know that all else equal mining chips gets more efficient so difficult should continue to rise (unless btc value falls a lot). We know how much heat would be considered a nuisance. We know how much ad impressions cost.
Although I haven't done the calcualtions, I'm betting that under the "nuisance heat" limit, and once the devices are a few months old, they will not generate enough revenue to buy a handful of ad impressions per day.
I base this on a USB miner I once ran that I got for free. It mined a dollar's worth of btc a day, when I got it. A few months later it was a few cents. And it ran rather hot, not enough to heat a room, but enough to be unsafe to touch - would require a fan if it were inside a case.
@_date: 2015-09-23 16:34:15
To me, this is bitcoin's main effect. It's not that we'll all abandon finance institutions for bitcoin (not for everything anyway).
Bitcoin will just always be a standby option to resist censorship. If the institutions **don't** play ball, we can use bitcoin and there's nothing they can do to stop us.
This will result in much lower fees, and much more lax rules about who can transact. This whole "KYC because taxes, drugs and terrorism" thing is ultimately going to collapse.
It's all years away of course, but all law enforcement and tax collection enforcement is going to have to abandon the financial realm. We'll see the return of good old fashioned investigation, and probably the death of income taxes. The gov't can still collect taxes, they'll just have to do it where people have a physical presence (property tax etc).

Obviously the bitcoin protocol has to absorb any truly superior features (that aren't just a different trade-off) before the alt that has them gets too much momentum. The bitcoin developers know that, I do not think they are stupid. It's just that there haven't been any real advances so far, just a bunch of pump and dumps, and the occasional unattractive tradeoff. 
Porting a feature that already exists in code elsewhere, to bitcoin, is not terribly expensive. It's far easier for bitcoin devs to let someone else take the risk and spend time developing the feature, and then copy it, than to try to develop it from scratch.

This scenario doesn't make sense, the network would be long dead before it got to that point. If these miners were attacking and they were the only ones who could keep up with the UTXO set, then no one but them would even know what the UTXO set is. Not much point in anyone else participating in that network, is there?
There would have to be one honest node in the world who could validate transactions (thus keeping up with the UTXO set). 
I think you don't appreciate how cheap that is already. Rough calculations show you could handle 10,000 tx/s for less than $1000 per month. How many organizations worldwide can afford that? Millions? 
I have no earthly idea why we'd stop at 2 tx/s. That's insane, IMO. It's to allow nodes to hide their location, supposedly to counter a threat where all governments worldwide are going to try to hunt down the nodes. That's not a threat we can counter, so we should stop trying. Governments can hunt down miners (or manfacturers of miners) easily. Or they could just make their own miners.

Great read, thanks.
A few things that stuck out to me:


Why doesn't this apply to bitcoin itself? People switched TO bitcoin, even though there were virtually no users, service providers, etc. The reason people switched TO bitcoin is the same reason they could possibly switch away to a minority network:  the feature set provides so much value, that the smaller group of users is an acceptable price to pay.
I think it may be helpful to think of the bitcoin node software, and the human operator of it, as two separate entities (and therefore two separate nodes). The human has a high degree of trust in the software (depending on his technical level, but even bitcoin experts must trust that the underlying hardware is honest). So there's really always at least 2 tiers, with the human being the lower tier. There could only be 1 tier if the human manually calculated everything without the use of a machine.
~~One conclusion that you seem to avoid making, is that "bitcoin as a settlement layer" is infeasible. If it cost you a $50 miner fee every time to "know you've been paid", then you would have no reason to run a full node. Almost nobody is willing to pay that.~~ (edit: I think I understand now why you don't conclude that - IIUC you think the non-hardware costs far outweigh the hardware costs. I'm not so sure. To know you've been paid and avoid censorship you only need to receive data without the authorities knowing you're receiving it. There's more ways to do that than just Tor - steganography for example).
Finally, I'm glad you touch on the fact that having good censorship-resistant layers beneath bitcoin would increase its value. Plain TCP/IP is not fully censorship resistant because it always reveals the metadata of who is communicating with whom. In fact, the internet itself is basically a two tier system, with the ISPs having the dominant position. A meshnet would be the decentralized equivalent.
@_date: 2015-09-27 01:54:34

Using these definitions, the defendant can just say he forgot the password and then it's outside anyone's jurisdiction. I think its naive that the legal system will ever accept that, and will instead take the heavy handed approach of assuming accessibility and jailing everyone who claims otherwise. Government and powerful people want "their" money and they have always used threats of violence to get it. Bitcoin only solves that to the degree you can plausibly deny having any.
@_date: 2015-04-08 13:38:11
That is assuming that the exchanges do not intend to steal customer deposits from the start. If they do, they will collude and voting pools will just make the scams bigger. I think most exchanges start with the intention of being honest, but I'm not sure.  It's not hard for exchange owners to drop hints to each other that they're interested in colluding.
The voting pool would be a lot safer if it included as many disinterested parties as possible (people who cannot steal the coins, they just verify the conditions of the trade have been met). I don't think there's any way to do that, except by having the bitcoin network enforce the trade.
And the bitcoin network is deliberately not capable of doing this, I believe for performance/scalability reasons.
I wonder though, if it's really that resource intensive to for a bitcoin node to verify sigs on messages that aren't bitcoin transactions.  Assuming the messages are reasonably short (can be stored in the blockchain directly).
Ethereum and counterparty supposedly do handle this kind of thing. I'm not a fan of having to use a separate token though.

Not in any practical way. The transaction would cost the network far more than it is worth. It doesn't work economically.

My BTC will be in my hardware wallet until after the fork.
Mind you, splitting them yourself is not easy. If you don't understand the technical details and you really want to sell 2x, you're probably better off just taking the counterparty risk and letting an exchange split them for you.
For me, splitting the coins on my trezor will probably go something like:
* Electrum, sign transaction tx1 to my wallet addr1, copy it (don't broadcast)
* Electrum, sign transaction tx2 to my wallet addr2, leave open (don't broadcast)
* Paste tx1 in the btc1 client, broadcast
* Immediately broadcast tx2 in electrum
* Wait to see if tx1 confirms in 2x, and tx2 in bitcoin. If so I'm done, if I get tx1 in both or tx2 in both, repeat the procedure.

@_date: 2017-10-24 16:46:48


Nope, because "miners" are not a single entity. If they were, the blockchain would be useless. As such, there is no scenario where all the miners leave at once since there's a fair amount of economic independence. Of course, it could be a lot better since many miners are in china, and chinese miners could all be commandeered at once. But this is an argument in favor of smaller blocks, since it allows miners to join more easily and hide from authorities.


This is a ridiculous fear. There is nothing whatsoever stopping anyone from running a LN hub on Tor and allowing absolutely any transaction with no KYC. You don't need to trust the hub so it doesn't matter if they're anonymous. If coinbase doesn't want to route directly to that anonymous hub, one of their users will. Coinbase will never know.


Neither is a network where miners and a few other wealthy users can conspire to inflate the supply far beyond 21m, and there is no way for lite wallet users to know about it.

\&gt; there are hundreds of ounces of "paper gold" for every ounce of physical.
I assumed this was the case as well, but I could not figure out how paper gold did not diverge in price from actual gold. To this day, you can buy physical gold for basically the exact same price.
Then again, nearly everywhere the price of merchandise is the same whether you pay with cash or check (despite the very real risk of default with checks). I don't know what else to conclude except "people are stupid"?

I don't think this is even a question. 
I can think of only one way to monetize bitcoin. That is to buy up a bunch of bitcoin, then create new demand for bitcoin. You do that by creating an application that lots of people want to use and **that requires bitcoin**.
That application would need to be something that helps users bypass some kind of authority. If it does anything else, then bitcoin is not required and the app will eventually lose to a cheaper and faster competitor. Examples of good targets:
* Dark net markets (bypasses drug enforcement etc)
* Ride/taxi service (bypasses taxi regulation)
* Underground software or graphic design company (bypasses tax collection agencies)
Personally I think companies trying to do remittances with bitcoin are wasting their time.

No but the disinterested parties still get to vote on any withdrawal, including to themselves. So they are capable of stealing the funds if they have a majority.
If the bitcoin network verified the other side of the trade, then it would be impossible for disinterested parties (the bitcoin network) to steal the funds, since "collusion" would involve the whole world.

I think OP just wants to buy bitcoin without giving personal info. This is possible.
LBC allows cash-in-person trade. I don't think they require ID verification. The counterparty will know your face, and so it's still possible for him to ask around and identify you. But as long as he doesn't do that and publicize it, no one can associate your name with a bitcoin purchase.

Companies who sell you bitcoin often ask for ID (it's the law in most places). You can buy on localbitcoins.com without id (since they are just matchmakers, they don't sell it themselves), but it is not that easy to do online anonymously. Edit: there are two reasons - 1) bitcoin payments are irreversible, other online payments are reversible, so it's hard to trade one for the other without being prone to scams. 2) Anti money laundering laws.
For sending or receiving bitcoin, you do not need anyone's permission.

Except satoshi was wrong. This is what the whole scaling debate was about! He thought his SPV model would scale, but it doesn't work. The idea was, blocks could get enormous, and clients don't need to validate anything except proof of work and their incoming transaction's presence in a huge merkle tree (which is easy). They just assume valid transactions. Actual validators with huge machines would validate, and if they found an invalid block in the most-work chain, they'd broadcast proof of that invalidity, and clients would only have to check that proof (which they don't need much computational power to do).
The problem is that provers can't always prove that a fraud is a fraud, and sometimes when they can it still takes tremendous computational power to check the proof. Also, malicious provers can DoS the network with fake proofs, etc.
It just didn't work.
Fortunately it doesn't really have to scale that much. Bitcoin is enormously valuable even if it can only process 300,000 txs a day forever. It's the world's first provably scarce asset, with zero supply elasticity (and it can't ever be less than zero, so it's basically perfect).

Just because it's a zero sum game, doesnt mean no one will play.

Lack of replay protection doesn't mean you can't move coins independently, it just takes more effort than usual. Exchanges should be able to split their coins very quickly. It's users who have to be careful.
You cannot dump b2x before it exists, but you can trade futures on bitfinex for example. The problem with that is counterparty risk - if you want to keep bitcoin and dump 2x, to trade it now you have to deposit bitcoin at the exchange. Later you won't have to do that, you can split yourself and only deposit what you want to sell.

I'm not sure what you mean by "accurate". That presumes that there is some inherent value in the network.
Are you asking if it's possible that people will completely misunderstand the risks and over-invest? Sure! But what other way forward is there? We can't treat a handful of devs as authorities either.
It isn't that the core devs are necessarily *wrong* about dangers of undertested forks. It's that they have been arguing from authority that they do not have. If there are risks, they need to convince people, not just "do what I say because I know better than you".
The fact that there are deeply technical matters involved, is irrelevant. If they truly understand the issues, they should be able to explain them to the non-technical.
All that said, I do think huge numbers of bitcoin owners have already underestimated risks in the next 5 years. I think a lot of forking and upheaval is still coming - it is not avoidable. There are too many possibilities and nothing stopping anyone from exploring them. Eventually it will settle down (I don't think there's a lot of contentious issues in tcp/ip these days), but that will take years.

He meant system-wide, not on one individual loan.
System-wide, money is created by debt, but the interest to repay the debt doesn't exist, and can only be created by creating more debt. So debt increases exponentially until people start defaulting. The worry is that there will be cascading defaults (Alice can't repay Bob, who is also in debt to Charlie, so Bob defaults. Charlie is in debt to Dave so Charlie also defaults, etc). That's certainly possible, and it would be painful for some, but debt would immediately start expanding again afterward. It wouldn't be the end of this debt-based system.

Yeah, I know that and it doesn't matter. Because as soon as futures prices depart from spot, people go to exchanges and either sell or buy, then arbitrage on the futures market (or vice versa) and the prices converge again. So to say "futures don't reduce supply" may be pedantically true, but for all intents and purposes here it's wrong. If people buy lots of futures, it absolutely does affect spot and reduces supply. If it didn't, the market would be completely detached and you couldn't really call them "bitcoin" futures because they'd have nothing to do with actual bitcoin.

DPR's trial, and really any trial where there's something at stake for the government, is pure theater.
The only reason that the trials of everyday criminals have any integrity at all, is to maintain an air of respectability.
Trials are controlled almost completely by the government. They control not only who the jurors are (to a large extent), but also what evidence they see.  Unless the judge, prosecutor, and law enforcement officers are trustworthy, there is no possibility of a "fair" trial. And we already see the law enforcement officers in the DPR case, are not trustworthy. There is no reason to think the judge or prosecutor are trustworthy either.
Besides, the question of whether Ulbricht ran the Silk Road website is not very interesting, we're all pretty sure he did. We just don't think he should go to prison for it. The more interesting question is, why is that a crime punishable by decades in prison? Why is it a crime at all?

Yes, I'm a software engineer, but that is not relevant.
You're basically saying it's easier for SuperCoin to build from scratch than for bitcoin to retrofit. That makes no sense. Worst case, bitcoin can also build from scratch too.
I'm not saying the bitcoin ledger **will** win, it's a competitive market and there's no guarantees.


But that's a perfect example of the tradeoff I'm talking about. Faster blocks mean higher orphan rate. Alts are free to make different tradeoffs, but usually it's a wash in terms of popularity, and bitcoin's network effect means the alt will fail.
@_date: 2018-07-23 21:26:13
It's not a problem. If the interest represents say, 1% of the total supply, 1% of those loans will have to default. Of course, that's an average over a long period of time. It's the same in the debt-based fractional reserve system that most fiat uses.
The reason it's a problem in the fiat system is that banks can lend money they don't actually have - it's created at the time of the loan. So there's really no brakes on that system, it just goes faster and faster until there's a massive cascading default at the end, popping the bubble.
I don't think that can happen with bitcoin. Banks would only be able to lend their own money (either really theirs, or borrowed). If it's borrowed, say at 1% interest, they would only want to lend it again if it paid more than 1%. So each re-loaning would have to increase the interest rate, which makes it less and less desirable to borrow, until no one wants to borrow it, or they do borrow it but end up defaulting.

The problem with the fiat side is that it's impossible to know whether a payment was actually made and irreversible.
For example, often a photo of a paper deposit receipt is used as "proof", which is of course trivial to fake, and often used to scam buyers on LBC. Or a deposit is verified electronically, but later the scammer reverses the payment.
Basically you cannot trust anyone on Bisq. I know that currently it probably works ok, but that will change very quickly if it gets popular. Why do you think LBC had to give up and require KYC? Because they were being overrun with scammers and it became impossible to operate any other way.

Central banks, tax collectors, banks, border/capital control, licensing authorities, payment processors, intellectual property police, etc.
Are these uses "legitimate"? Depends who you ask. Some people see the Iranian government's censorship of homosexuality as illegitimate. Others see their own government organizations' censorship as illegitimate.

I don't see how it could. Github doesn't do testing, at best it will just give testers a place to write down what they tested. And there's no way to know whether testers really tested anything. They could just say "I ran 10 billion tests and they all passed! Gimme money!".
What *would* be useful is if people contributed automated tests that everyone could run themselves.
For code review, it would help if developers mentioned somewhere who pointed out the problem with their previous attempt (so that they can get credit for helping them fix it).

Let's say the money supply is fixed (no inflation). If I loan you $100 at 3% interest that means I expect there's at most 3% chance you will default. If I make thousands of similar loans, on average I will be paid back $100. So why does new money need to be created to pay back all the loans?

In memory based mining, the resource being "wasted" are memory chips instead of electrical power. Memory chips will have to be produced continuously. I know some people do not realize that. 
To see why, remember that mining a block must require some kind of real world sacrifice. Currently that's electrical power that must be fed in continuously. If a memory-miner can just set up a small computer with a massive amount of ram, and then do nothing further, he can collect profit without any marginal costs. That isn't going to be a stable situation - other miners will enter by adding more RAM. And so on, it will never stabilize, RAM must be produced continuously in this setup.
That in no way favors smaller miners any more than double-sha256.

That means, of the people who do have an opinion and are willing to bet on it, most of them are betting that bitcoin will win. That doesn't mean it will, necessarily, but it's the best measure we have right now and it's giving bitcoin 85% odds.

It will still work just fine as is.

Still, even in that event, smart traders will just bid higher for block space if the exchange prices are favorable enough. Fees could get very high, temporarily, but will return to roughly where they are now.

It's a bit more subtle than that.
Consensus rules are easy to compare for equality with the events that have occurred **up to now**. But it's difficult (or impossible) to prove that about all possible future input.
So old contracts will behave the same at the time of deployment of a new Solidity (if they don't, it'll be obvious and they'll abort the deployment). The problem is the contract could later diverge from what the old Solidity did (and what the contract's developers originally tested against).

Gold had value long before chemistry or electronics existed.
Also, how do you know that gold's use as jewelry caused its high value, and not the other way around? Jewelry is a show of wealth, after all. Wouldn't people wear gold *because* it was valuable already?
This is just the same old tired "intrinsic value" argument. There's no such thing.

That's not the point, because it cuts both ways:
If 70% agree to activate segwit, then 19% can back out and segwit will still activate. Not only that, but the 19% that backs out will lose a lot of blocks.

@_date: 2017-10-25 12:56:22


It's a continuum, obviously. My criteria is, "are fees over $50? If not, blocks are not full. If so, maybe time to talk about increasing block size".
I know some people will go "$50 are you insane? I'm not paying that!" And they say this because they're just fucking around with bitcoin, doing absolutely nothing with it that they couldn't do with paypal.


None! That's the whole point. If they're buying everyday crap, why the fuck do they care about bitcoin? The only reason they're involved at all is because they thought they were getting something for nothing. Well, they're not. Everything has tradeoffs.


When I said "fucking around" I didn't mean they were doing low value transactions. I meant they are buying everyday crap that, if they used paypal instead it would have worked perfectly fine.
If they were actually buying something where paypal, CC, bank transfer, etc were all blocked, and bitcoin was their only option, they would not give a flying fuck about paying $5. They'd do it happily, again and again.

Utter nonsense.
Merchants will say "aren't we great, we accept bitcoin!"
And then it'll be crickets. Nobody will pay using bitcoin. Why the fuck should they? Why would I make an irreversible payment, instead of a reversible one for the exact same price?
There's no reason. Nobody will do this, just like nobody did it in 2014.
The deal is, merchants either offer bitcoin discounts, or just don't bother. Their credit card agreements ban them from offering discounts, so basically, don't bother.
Sure, some of them will accept bitcoin anyway, and some bitcoin users will be dumb enough to use it. I'm sure some merchants will accept gold coins too, that doesn't mean it's a good idea to use them when the merchant also accepts flimsy credit card payments.

Then you ignored it: 


I'll say it again with different words: coins used to be made of precious metals, and they existed because lumps of equal amounts of metal were very difficult to tell if they were pure. This is not an issue for bitcoin. There is no reason whatsoever to have a denomination of 1 "coin".

This is a bad idea.
You will be stuck with that forever. You can't just switch mining algos on people, that's equivalent to firing all the miners.
Just start with double sha256. Yes, the chain will be vulnerable to rewrites at first, and that will depress the value of the token. That's fine! There will probably be kinks to iron out anyway, and people shouldn't be too dependent on it as real money immediately anyway.
Eventually the attackers will tire of wasting their hashpower on useless attacks, and they'll either give up or switch.
Alternative PoW algos are mirage. It looks like they'll provide advantages to small miners, but it just evaporates when the time comes. The specialists will win. With cuckoo cycle, the specialists will be mass producers of memory chips. 
At least when the real-world sacrifice is electricity, there's an endgame that tips the balance back to small miners: heat dissipation. You probably won't get that when the sacrifice is memory chip production. It'll never tip back to the small miners.
We're approaching the double-sha256 endgame that tips back to smaller miners. Don't abandon that path now!

I'm still bullish on bitcoin, but I wish I could say that using bitcoin today was a vastly better experience than two years ago. It's not. It's actually slightly worse, because now blocks are full and the network is less forgiving with insufficient fees. I've still got my trezor and mycelium (which are pretty much unchanged since then). It's easy enough for me to use, but it takes time to learn for nontechnical people. They still have no reason to bother learning it. I believe few of them ever will.

I swear the only reason there's any resistance to this idea at all, is that people think the price would crash if that were true. It's becoming clear that there's still a decade (or more) to go in which nontechnical people will have no clue which bitcoin software they should download. They will probably just avoid the whole mess.
That may already be somewhat priced in. Remember that anyone who holds coins now, will hold coins in the winning fork, no matter which one it is. Forks do inflate the supply of cryptocurrency, which should make the price of each one decline. However most of these forks will not be long-lived. The only ones that should survive are those that offer some useful feature that others do not.
Many (perhaps like bitcoin core) will have safety features that are not evident until some other fork gets attacked. The core devs would be content to just wait for this to happen, if they weren't so impatient to push bitcoin on non-technical people.
I wish bitcoin would take over the world quickly, but that is just not going to happen. No amount of "governance" is going to help - it's only going to result in infighting, politics, and a weaker ecosystem.

Censorship resistance has costs. If you are not willing to pay those costs, you are welcome to use a less-secure chain. Limiting block sizes helps sort people to the chain best suited to their purposes (if you need the security, you must pay the fee).
You might argue that we can just bump up the block size limit without affecting security at all, but the research I've seen says otherwise.

Bitcoin is similar to gold in some ways, but has distinct advantages.
Like gold it:
* Cannot be created at the whim of governments - it has a limited supply
It is better than gold in that:
* It can be transferred nearly instantly anywhere on earth, very cheaply
* It is much cheaper to secure, hide, and transport anywhere. Large amounts of bitcoin are just as cheap to manage as small amounts. You can even carry any amount of bitcoin across national borders entirely in your brain, and it's impossible for anyone to know you have it.
* It is programmable - transfers can be made under pre-programmed complex conditions
* Can be easily used for payments because it's easily authenticated (impossible to counterfeit).
* Can be easily used for payments because it's (practically) infinitely divisible 
There are a few drawbacks, for example, privacy - currently if you don't take any precautions it might be possible for someone to know who you received bitcoin from or who you sent it to. But that issue is being worked on.

It won't earn much, but enough to get a modest discount on the appliance.

If convenience was your real reason for doing this, you would just tack $33 onto the price of the hardware, and include 0.1 BTC with it. Then you wouldn't have to waste your time and your user's electricity.

You can use coinbase with low or no fee. It's a little more involved though. Once you have a coinbase account you can switch right over to gdax. Deposit money from your bank account (the drawback is you'd have to wait a few days for it to clear, and the price could go up by then).
Then you would place a market order for however much you want to buy. The fee is 0.25% or something.
You could also put in a limit order for no fee at all. However there's no guarantee it would get executed. The price would have to go down slightly to hit your buy order.
If you want instant (no waiting for transfer to clear) then you're not going to find lower fees than 1.5%. Localbitcoin is much more expensive than that for buying, it's good for selling though.

If you have some other form of payment that works for you, I think you are crazy to even attempt to use bitcoin.

You're assuming what we're trying to prove here.
I understand that the 95% is a "no penalty" threshold - if you're in the minority there's no financial loss. Whereas a failed 51% attack does have a heavy penalty. My point is that a heavy penalty is probably not a deterrent if the majority is sure that they have a majority. I think segwit is a good example where they have an overwhelming majority, but not a penalty-free majority.
Let me put it to you this way. What if the majority forced their will on ViaBTC by producing temporary hashpower instead, to get them to 95%? Would that sow any less discord?

No, bisq has essentially zero liquidity, and that can only be solved by it becoming centralized like LBC. The only way there can ever be a arbitrator that both parties trust, is if there's a publicly known large central party (like what LBC is). No one in their right mind is going to trust two random Tor addresses they've never heard of (the counterparty and the arbitrator).
Bisq can only survive by becoming exactly what LBC already is - an easily censored third party.
It has chosen not to do that of course, which is why no one uses it, because the sacrifices it makes for censorship resistance make it absolutely ripe for scams and abuse. So everyone wisely avoids it.

His answer about bitcoin is better than I expected. At least he recognizes (sort of) that bitcoin's censorship resistance is a deliberate feature. He says anonymity, even though that's inaccurate, it's not too far off. 
What he doesn't seem to realize is that censorship resistance is the entire idea. Even a lot of bitcoiners don't want to admit this. If bitcoin cannot resist censorship, it will cease to exist. There is no scenario where bitcoin is successfully regulated - it can either succeed or fail. However, even if it is destroyed, it's likely to be replaced by something even **more** censorship resistant at some point in the future. Some bitcoin fans think that bitcoin is about cheap digital payments. To quote Hannibal Lecter, "No, that is incidental".

Bitcoin is political whether we want it to be or not. You can't take away seigniorage and other money controls typically granted to states, without invoking politics.

Note that emacs' single-threadedness has been a known problem for quite a while already. It's possible that will get addressed sometime in the next 50 years. Fixing it is not trivial at all (since all the elisp written to date is built on a single-threaded model). But 50 years is a long time.

coinbase + trezor is what I do actually.
Here's how it works. You buy on coinbase and the bitcoin gets credited to your coinbase account. Then you go to your trezor wallet and copy the receiving bitcoin address. On the coinbase website, you go to withdraw bitcoin, it will ask you for a destination address. Paste the address you copied earlier (and be sure to double-check the correctness - many people have lost coins by pasting an address from somewhere else by accident and not noticing it. Don't just assume what's in your computer's clipboard is the one you intended, visually check). 
I think (but i've never done it) you can actually specify your bitcoin address right when you do the purchase on coinbase (rather than doing it after the purchase is complete).
Good luck!

As far as I can tell, the only way this can happen is if either a) there is overwhelming economic support from day 1, but this is not obvious to miners, or b) economic support grows after the split.
Given that the only signaling mechanism we have right now is reddit and twitter, it's a realistic outcome. However, this is all on exchanges - they could start trading for futures contracts for bip148 chain now. This should be fairly routine by now, and unfortunately it isn't. I don't understand why exchanges just guess as what new listings they should add. They have the market already, just ask them! They could sell contracts to determine which proposed listings have the most interest from traders. Yeah, i know it's complex but at least those contracts could be generic, just implement once and clone them for each proposed listing. The new listings are the ones that require a lot of work (need to run a validating node, add possibly unique UI support etc).

It has to be possible to run n node, even a mining node, over Tor (or some other network that hides your location). Otherwise bitcoin is pretty easy for governments to root out and shut down. They join the network, find the IP addresses of the peers, and go knock on their doors.

Running around trying to find someone who will accept bitcoin is a waste of time and effort that doesn't help adoption at all. It does just the opposite - makes bitcoin appear silly and worthless. Think about it, why should a merchant want to accept something you clearly are trying to get rid of?
Just be patient and let them come to you. It will happen. Eventually merchants will understand bitcoin and will actively try to get their hands on yours, by offering discounts and other incentives.

@_date: 2016-10-18 12:56:30
I think you may be joking, but I agree with this.
I think the absolute change in the inflation rate is what matters - last time it went from 20+% to 12%, and this time it was around 8% to 4%.
As a thought experiment to show this is true - imagine you don't know what the bitcoin inflation rate is, you just have to infer it from the market. Let's say the inflation rate had been 1000% and it drops to 500%. That would be fairly noticeable change. Compare that with an inflation rate of 0.01% dropping to 0.005%. That would be pretty much impossible to detect.  So we can see that even though it was a "halving" in both cases, the supply change will be noticed quicker in the former case.
Granted, this is different from the current bitcoin market because we **do** know the inflation rate, and have known it all along for every point in time. However if you believe the market has not fully accounted for the change, then it seems reasonable to think it will take longer for it to "catch up" than it did for the first halving.

Yep. That graph clearly shows that $19600 prices didn't make much of a dent in the old coins. 20-25% lost, easily (assuming satoshi never returns, which is pretty safe bet at this point).  Sure, some of those old coins still have keys and the owners just have balls of steel. But those are a small proportion. And, there are coins lost more recently, where it won't be obvious they're lost for many years, which more than makes up for the ballsy hodlers.
That's 3,400,000 to 4,200,000 coins lost. Max 21m? No, max 17,600,000.

Simple: it takes away people's ability to validate their own incoming transactions. It doesn't matter whether they do it now or not, the ability to do so is what matters.
I don't use my full node for validation now, but if I were to receive a large payment I absolutely would use it to validate that payment instead of SPV wallet. If I could not do that with commodity hardware and residential internet, then I would have to trust someone else to do it.
There's a balance between "can't afford fees" and "can't afford a node". However it's weighted toward fees being more acceptable: fees can decrease and not affect new users, but blocks processing is forever (a large block now has to be validated now and by every new node that joins the network in the future).
I think every avenue of offchain scaling should be pursued first, and we have not even begun to do that. On-chain scaling is the dumb and inefficient solution.

This is why "bitcoin" is a terrible name.
There are no "coins". Bitcoin is equivalent to gold, not gold coins. It should have been called something like "bitium" (so that it sounds like an element).
Then we need a unit name, that measures how much "bitium" you have, just like "gram" measures how much gold you have.
Since money is just a relative measure (how much you have compared to everyone else), I see no reason not to just use that directly, and convert to satoshis behind the scenes.
"I'd like to buy 4 shares of bitium please".  Where a "share" is a ten-billionth of the eventual world supply (I chose 10^10 because that's the closest power of ten to the world population at the moment). That comes out to 840,000 satoshis.

No, it's because it's a zero sum game that the energy consumption will not change.
As miners get more efficient, difficulty increases so that the energy required stays the same. The only thing that makes the energy requirements go up (in theory) is the need for more security (higher bitcoin value, mostly).

My opinion: Can the bitcoin network go mainstream? No, not while commodity computers and network connections cannot handle anywhere near the full stream of the world's transactions. It's a niche product, most everyday transactions just don't need the censorship resistance. They might care about inflation protection, but probably not.
Can the bitcoin unit of account go mainstream? Maybe, if there's some way to keep the inflation protection and still be fast and cheap. Sidechains, lightning, etc.

Once you've accounted for risk, there's no further risk, so it's basically free money. Then competition should push the margins down toward zero. However you're right that it can't be exactly zero, since at that point it's a lot easier to just keep your money. Also there are costs associated with assessing risk.
Still, none of this really matters. If the money supply is fixed and interest rate is nonzero, then by definition some of the loans must default. Some of the loans were going to default anyway, so I don't see why this is a problem.

Looked at a certain way, even the US dollar is only 45 years old. What if, instead of disconnecting from the gold standard in the 70's and still calling it a dollar, they had called it something else? The outcome is the same, it doesn't matter what the name is.

That is obviously untrue. "Bitcoin had no market" is probably what you meant to say. So no one knew the value, and probably everyone had a different idea of what it was. But it wasn't zero.
If bitcoin had no value then no one would have ever wasted time mining for bitcoin. The fact that they did, shows it had some value (at least, to that miner). 
Same goes for testnet. They have *almost* no value, people only mine on and use testnet to make sure their bitcoin setup works properly. That's testnet's value.

The part I don't get is, how does everyone agree on exactly when 10 minutes is up?

The real reason bitcoin's brand doesn't speak to them, is that the authorities they've been conditioned to obey do not sanction bitcoin. I think people understand this part quite well - that's all they need to know.
They never thought about why, and most of them never will, because they lack the inclination to question authority in the first place. They assume the authority must have an ethically defensible reason not to sanction bitcoin. "Bitcoin is only for drug dealers" lets them move on after two seconds of consideration, so their attitude rests there with a great deal of inertia.
I believe that's as far as bitcoin will ever get with the vast majority of adults who are alive today. As much as I'd like to see hyperbitcoinization happen soon, I think the conditioning is too strong. Like racism or homophobia, it will only be defeated when a new generation takes over.

I don't think that's what he's saying at all. It's not about philosophy, it's about pure self-interest.
IMO, right now bitcoin is literally not in most people's self-interest. Even if they could be paid in it (which they cannot, they can only automatically convert), it could easily lose half its value before they can spend their paycheck. 99% of the places they spend their paycheck don't accept bitcoin so they'd have to convert back. It's a no-brainer poor choice for the vast majority of the first-world population. They may benefit from a risky investment, but they aren't interested.
That will not necessarily remain the case though. The niche where it is a clear benefit will grow to include more and more people. It starts with drug (and other contraband) dealers - who really have no alternative to bitcoin if they want the benefits of online sales. It can then spread to digital content producers (web designers, software, graphic artists, etc) who want to run a cash business (perhaps running afoul of regulations, but they're not likely to be caught if they're not completely careless). Or those who wish to evade capital controls, or those whose banking system is in crisis. As the niche grows, the benefits increase and the risk decreases.

Yeah, so?
Of course you could probably get merchants to accept chicken feet also, if you gave them a big enough discount. That would make up for the inconvenience of them having to exchange chicken feet (which they don't want to hold), for something they *do* want (dollars).
For the most part, today's merchants that have bitpay accounts don't actually accept bitcoin at all. They accept bitpay.  Bitpay accepts bitcoin. The merchant never touches bitcoin, and they don't want it. 
There is a chicken and egg problem. Merchants won't offer a discount for bitcoin customers, even though bitcoin saves them money. The volume is insignificant, not even worth it to update their pricing. Bitcoin holders don't bother using it to pay for everyday crap, because it's a waste of bitcoin. Why spend your secure, sound money, when the merchant accepts reversible payments that you can claw back if you have a complaint?  I think eventually this will be overcome, but it is not going to be accelerated by begging merchants to sign up with bitpay.

Safe deposit box with tamper-proof seals on the envelope. Yeah, it doesn't actually prevent bank employees from reading the seed, but at least it discourages them - by showing that you will be able to detect that the envelope has been opened.
The other alternative is splitting the seed with Shamir's secret sharing algo, and distributing it to family/friends (choose the thresholds carefully to ensure they will be unlikely to collude). However I wouldn't advise doing this with a hardware wallet seed, because it defeats the security (the point being that the seed has never been seen by a general purpose computer). I'm not sure if any hardware wallets support shamir's directly yet.

It really depends on what you're trying to do. Most people who want to get the money out of their retirement account, are doing it *because* it doesn't let them take enough risks with it.
Other people might be worried about government raiding their account, so if that's the threat (and I'm not saying it's a real threat), then withdrawing and doing something like buying physical gold might be a valid strategy, and not particularly risky (aside from the guaranteed loss of the tax/penalty).
Edit: the 26% is a bit misleading, since the tax has to be paid sooner or later. You get the benefit of compounding earnings tax-free, and possibly a lower tax bracket with a tax deferred account, but it's not like you don't pay tax at all. So the real tax/penalty above what you have to pay no matter what, is probably closer to 12-15%?

This is not necessarily true. Revenue is average fee times number of txs in the block. By increasing the block size, it's possible to increase profits - it depends on how the average fee responds to the increase in capacity. If capacity doubles but the avg fee halves, then the miners break even. If the avg fee goes down by 40% then miners have increased their profits.

As I've pointed out to you before, I don't think this is logically impossible.

Would the difference be enough to overcome the advantages a centralized miner has? I am not sure.
Even if everyone had a miner in their hot water heater, would they really control the mining policy themselves? For the vast majority, probably not.

That would be sufficient for me. I find Wright extremely unlikable, and I could name 100 people that I would rather be satoshi, but if he signs with the keys from the genesis block, it would be very difficult for anyone else to legitimately claim to be satoshi.

"Irreparably tainted" is putting it lightly. He hung out to dry.
I wonder what Gavin thinks now, I hope this will motivate him to post the details of his meeting with Wright. I don't know if he is legally bound to keep those secret due to signing an NDA, but given the circumstances, I hope Gavin posts it anyway. Craig Wright seems to have enough legal problems already, I doubt he's going to have time to sue Gavin over an NDA.

The title is "Why I'm short Ethereum", but the explanation is "Why I think Ethereum is flawed and not likely to deliver on its promises".
Those are two totally different things, and just mentioning that markets can be irrational doesn't really resolve it.
An explanation of "Why I'm short Ethereum" should contain reasons why other people will soon sell ether.
I think it's incredibly unlikely that ethereum investors are going to be able to digest the technical arguments against it. Those arguments have been around since the beginning. I think ethereum probably won't fail until people actually try to write contracts in it and they end up having bugs that other parties exploit. Remember, the DAO fork already happened and didn't have much effect on the market. Neither did the recent DOS attacks. The price could go up 100x or more before that happens. Shorting now is extremely unwise, IMO. I think the irrational exuberance has barely begun. It's also possible that ethereum will be overhauled and address the issues.

It's not an "idea", it's a reality.
Open a coinbase account, send bitcoin to it directly from a gambling site. Watch how fast your account is closed, because coinbase does not treat all bitcoin equally. 
What's important here is not that some stupid company cares whose hands bitcoin passes through on its way to them, it's that this information is even available. It shouldn't be.

I think this argument depends on a false assumption - that is, that the "new" fork won't protect itself against "high and dry" attacks.
Of course the new fork could easily do so. All it has to do is alter the difficulty adjustment algorithm so that the difficulty can't be raised so high that the fork can't reach the next adjustment.
Of course, that doesn't guarantee safety from all attack, but it does guarantee that any attack must be sustained. In other words, it successfully defends against a one-time deadly attack. It forces attackers to lose money continuously, hoping the minority chain will just give up.

I hope you don't mean this in the sense of "markets are always efficient". 
I personally don't think ethereum can become much more valuable, because it's yet to present compelling use cases that it's in a unique position to solve.


The "worse" solution here is not ethereum, it's the US dollar and banks and lawyers. It gets the job done and people are familiar with it.

@_date: 2015-11-13 11:41:30


A centralized blockchain run by a bank really just means the bank can't lie (by producing two different state changes from the same base state and sending them to different parties). The two parties can compare notes and catch the central control cheating. That does not exist in today's bank accounts. So it's more secure. Banks of course have no intention (yet) of giving this power (to catch them cheating) to their individual account holders. Their motive is to catch **other banks** cheating.
It's also faster and cheaper than today's bank accounts. That's still something people want. It's also something they could have been doing decades ago, digital signatures and hashes are not new.

I don't think so. I think this a gross overestimation for the demand for censorship resistant transactions. 
How many people actually want 1-10 censorship-resistant transactions **per day**? I'd argue there are none now, and there will never be anywhere close to a billion. 
There's lots of reasons to use bitcoin besides censorship resistance, but you can get them with off-chain transactions too, for a tiny fraction of the cost (edit: of the theoretical $1 per day):
* The bitcoin unit of account
* Privacy
* Cheap transactions
* Fast transactions
And you'll still have a certain amount of censorship resistance, just not the maximum. I think payment channels (and other low-trust off-chain mechanisms) will be the norm. I wouldn't be surprised if the number of bitcoin full nodes in the world never exceeded 100,000.

That's my current take on it too. A con artist and/or attention whore.
He says he doesn't want attention, but his actions are completely attention-seeking. There's no legitimate reason I can find, for him to "prove" he's satoshi to Gavin, but not publicly. Nobody in their right mind would believe that "proving" it to Gavin would make the media leave him alone.
Why would satoshi invent a system of cryptographic proof such that you don't need to trust an authority, and then turn around and say, "Trust this authority (Gavin) who says that I'm satoshi!" It makes no sense to me.
None of his explanations add up, in fact, they seem rather transparent. Why would he go out of his way, in the BBC interview, to say that he doesn't want a cent of anyone's money? If he's satoshi, he clearly doesn't need anyone's money. The obvious explanation is that he doesn't want to be prosecuted for criminal fraud. So far, he's just been lying, which is probably not a criminal offense. But if he profits from those lies, then it's a crime.
The biggest disappointment to me here is Gavin. I thought he was a pretty reasonable guy until yesterday. I can't believe he was willing to participate in this ruse. It doesn't even matter if Wright **is** satoshi, Gavin still should not have been willing to publicly state anything about him. He should have said, "if you want to prove you're satoshi, do it publicly, you don't need me".
Andreas Antonopolous got it mostly right. No authority is needed to verify satoshi's identity. However, it kind of does matter whether he's satoshi - if you care about the bitcoin market. If Wright is satoshi, then the game has changed - until yesterday the logic was "if satoshi wishes to remain anonymous, he won't sell his coins". If he's no longer anonymous, that is one step closer to a million coins becoming liquid.
Given that the price only dropped about 2%, it would seem the market is saying there's not a high likelihood that Wright is satoshi.

How exactly are they going to steal it? 
The precautions you should take with your bitcoin are proportional to their value. I actually know someone who put his stash in a threshold multisig contract with friends and family all over the world, so that even if a criminal threatened him with violence, he would not even have the power himself to transfer the bitcoin.
There are risks no matter what. In traditional banking you are entirely dependent on their (or someone else's) definition of criminal. If they decide to include you in that definition, your money may be gone. Remember that in the US, it is currently an offense to transfer more than 10k without filling out a report, and it's also an offense to transfer less than 10k so that you don't need to fill out a report.

It's not a hardware wallet, it's a "USB storage device" or "USB stick". Since it actually does store data, you're not lying if you call it this.
However, good idea to have a decoy account just in case they decide to put you through the wringer. Doesn't matter if they seize it, you have the seed backed up in some other location. They won't be able to seize the coins because they not only don't have your password, they don't even know one exists.

Yes, it's missing the point. Either anyone can participate, or there's some kind of gatekeeper who you have to trust to do what they say they will do.

Virtually no one who owns bitcoin actually gets paid directly in it, and very few pay for things directly in it. That means they're just speculating - they get paid in fiat, convert to bitcoin, and then convert back to fiat to trade for something else.

I just tried to verify this signature in bitcoin core and it failed. Anyone know what I'm doing wrong? I put the address from the sig field at the bottom in one input in the "Verify Message" panel, and the entire pastebin message in the other.
Edit: Message verified! Here's how I did it in case anyone else wants to: There are actually 3 fields in the panel in bitcoin core. The first is the address from just above the bottom of the pastebin. The next large field is the message with the ---- BEGIN etc lines and sig and address stripped out. The last field is just the signature (2nd to last line of the pastebin).

If by "destroy" you mean "cause to go way down", there's all kinds of stuff that would panic the market.
* Large amount of coins dumped by large holder(s)
* Miner attack (51% or even a smaller attack)
* Deliberate forking of the software and hence the ledger
* Accidental forking of the ledger (due to a bug)
* Newly found weaknesses in the hashing or signature algorithm bitcoin uses
However none of these would cause permanent damage - they can all be mitigated and recovered from. Bitcoin is an idea whose time has come, nothing is going to stop it. Some of those events might take years to recover from, though. 
Edit: compromising ECDSA and/or RIPEMD-160 might make the ledger useless, so that would probably kill it and force a complete restart with new algorithms. I don't think breaking sha256 would completely kill it though, I think we could always manually agree on the last known good chain and restart from there with a new hashing algorithm. I'm not sure the community would accept that, but it's possible.

If they really wanted to hurt bitcoin, they wouldn't buy it. They'd start producing mining chips, reach 51% hash rate, and halt the network. Of course the community would change algorithms, but the fed can print enough money to do the same thing over and over.

You probably know better than me, but I don't get what you are saying.
To put downward pressure on the price, an exchange just creates a fake account on their own platform, writes 100,000 bitcoin into it (that don't exist), and starts selling them. This has already happened at mtgox.
Granted, generally exchanges would not let their users do this. But the exchanges themselves can do it.

The closest thing I have seen to validating your own incoming trezor-controlled funds via your own node, but without electrum server, unfortunately involves importing each individual address into core.

I'm not sure what that means, but it should not be possible to ever retrieve the seed from the trezor in any way. I guess it means just leave the trezor alone and don't create a new seed.
In that case I would have to suspect a password mismatch. All passwords are valid, but mismatches will just lead to an empty wallet.

It's just that banks have no role in a bitcoin world. What do you expect them to do, say "welp, I guess we're not needed anymore" and shut down? Of course not. First of all it's not true - some people still want a third party to control their money (because it's convenient, they don't trust themselves, don't care about privacy or censorship etc).


If you have a bank account or credit card, you already use something much worse. It's just a database with no means of authentication at all. A private blockchain is much better than that, because the bank can't just arbitrarily change balances and claim they didn't.

How do you figure? Mtgox was insolvent long, long before Dec 2013.
My take on it is, willybot was buying bitcoin with made-up dollars that only existed in mtgox's database. It just kept buying and buying no matter how high the price rose. The market sees there's a buyer at any price, so it makes sense to buy and sell to him later. Huge bubble ensues. To me it looks like the fraud caused the bubble, not the pop.

Yes, that spreads the risk, but it's still the same risk. Guess who pays for this insurance? The banks, and guess where the banks get their money? You. The point is the bank should be paying you to lend them money, because YOU are taking the risk. Instead, you're paying them.
You should have the option to not take the risk. In Sweden it sounds like the government wants to take away that option. I have no idea why anyone would want their options taken away.

Of course it makes sense.
I have a retirement account, basically whether I like it or not. I can either take a 401k or not accept free money. I cannot just take the money as cash.
So given that I have a retirement account, what do I do with it? I can buy various stocks, bonds, funds etc. There's no reason why one of those funds can't hold bitcoin. Of course it's preferable to invest directly in bitcoin, but that is irrelevant. That direct investment is not possible, I can only make choices from what I am given.

I'm confused. Activate a few months faster than **what**? I didn't think that there was any alternative except waiting for the 95% threshhold that will basically never come.
Or are you referring to waiting for the current signaling period to expire and starting a new one with a different activation mechanism?
@_date: 2017-05-31 13:17:33
Yeah, except big blocks completely screw up the security properties of the network, and segwit doesn't.
@_date: 2017-05-30 17:57:02
I'm as impatient as anyone - I want segwit and LN too. But if I'm being totally honest with myself, there's no reason to rush into a disruptive or dangerous change.
Bitcoin is working fine as is, and the market seems to think it's more valuable now than before fees went up. The segwit voting period is 6 months old, it's not exactly a major delay so far. ASICboost is public knowledge (Bitmain is not the only producer who can include a covert version) and it's not even clear to me that this is necessarily Jihan Wu's motive. 
However it does seem clear we've reached the limit of miner activated soft forks, segwit is just not uncontroversial enough for that. So we need a better signaling mechanism. BIP148 is using reddit and twitter, which is basically useless and I certainly don't blame miners for being wary of it (since they're the ones who stand to lose the most by being on the wrong side of it).

They have no idea what they're talking about. They've realized that they can use crypto to make their systems more efficient, but they don't seem to have processed all the complexity of which cryptosystem tools make sense for them.
They could have been using digital signatures for decades now, I think they are referring to "blockchain technology" because it saves face. They can say this is all new and that's why they haven't been doing it all this time.
In a sense it's true - it's obvious that bitcoin is what got them energized to revisit how these systems should work. In the end though, banks will still be powered by "threat of violence", not "proof of work".
In other words, in these new banking systems, the only thing that prevents parties from cheating is the threat of being taken to court or arrested. The crypto will only serve as a means of reliably gathering evidence of cheating.

There's a whole class of "confidence" attacks, that we shouldn't worry about. These are attacks that may panic the market, but the real effects are of a known, short duration.
We saw how they played out two years ago, when mtgox was getting DDOS'd to cause panics so that the attackers could profit from it.
After panic was induced successfully a few times, it stopped working. People learned that panic selling was a bad idea, and they stopped doing it. I don't remember exactly how many attacks there were, 3-4 maybe. On the next attack, the price actually increased a little. And that was the last time it happened.
There's lots of DOS attacks like this, where the outage may last for days while a patch is prepared (like your example). Another example: an attacker shorts bitcoin and then pays miners to stop processing transactions. Market panics, attacker covers short and goes long. Rinse and repeat.

Read the bitcoin whitepaper or Satoshi's early emails. He explains concepts in a clear, concise, and accurate way.
Then read Wright's blog posts, eg: 
There's nothing clear or concise about it. It seems to be targeting an audience who doesn't know what a hash algorithm is, but this is how he tries to explain it:


I know what hash algorithms do and I can barely understand the above paragraph. 32 bytes is "a large string of values"? He mentions "collisions" without explanation. "To determine *and* find"? 
The whole blog is like that. It's the exact opposite of satoshi's writing.
Here's satoshi explaining **to highly technical people** how double spends are resolved - note the use of plain, and unambiguous language, with no techical jargon whatsoever:


cheater. We merely adjudicate which one of the spends is valid. Receivers of
transactions must wait a few blocks to make sure that resolution has had time
to complete. Would be cheaters can try and simultaneously double-spend all
they want, and all they accomplish is that within a few blocks, one of the
spends becomes valid and the others become invalid. Any later double-spends
are immediately rejected once there's already a spend in the main chain. 
I believe there is no way in hell that Craig Wright wrote the whitepaper or satoshi's early emails.

We don't have any "whole worlds in a lab" to run economic experiments on. We just have the one world, and almost none of the conditions can be controlled. One of the conditions is human culture, which is not only uncontrollable, but also hopelessly complex.
In other words, economists do study and observe, but they have little hope of figuring out much at all. They're witch doctors. They may occasionally observe that a certain root does successfully treat a certain illness, but they have no power to understand the mechanism of action, or make better-than-chance predictions.

I had a discussion recently where the other person had a different definition for "blockchain" than you might expect, but I guess I can't say he is wrong.
He meant groups of transactions (blocks) and blocks are chained together with hashes. No proof of work (edit: or any consensus algorithm) is necessarily involved.  At least if a centralized service published these blocks (and presumably signs them, and there's only one chain), they cannot just change history without it being detected. 
That's a much less interesting tool than the bitcoin blockchain, of course.
@_date: 2017-05-23 02:20:37
I imagine it's a pretty hard engineering problem.
The order book for a single trading pair (eg, BTC-USD) can't be easily parallelized - each order can affect the orders that come after it.
And if the system falls behind real time, it's hurting users by delaying execution - at prices the users didn't intend. So there's nothing graceful the exchange can do when it's overloaded, people get screwed.
I was curious how many orders per second, on a single stock, the NYSE can handle. I wasn't able to find that stat. But I'm guessing it's far lower than the throughput for the entire exchange.

I disagree. Bitcoin as a fiat transport is completely useless, unless there's some censorship that it is bypassing. 
If you already have a debit card, and you're buying everyday stuff like coffee, no one is censoring you. Just use the debit card. Given a choice between making a reversible and irreversible payment, all else equal, you should choose the reversible one. If something goes wrong, you can potentially claw back your money. With bitcoin, you can't. Without any other incentive (like a discount), it makes no sense to use it.
Even though it's useless, I've used bitcoin online a couple times at merchants like overstock and newegg, but it was just for fun. I did it once and then never again, even though I certainly could use bitcoin there every time.

Yeah, two things are required to be able to use the heat from your miner (edit: as part of an appliance): 
1) The miner's chip has to be reasonably close to a commodity. This isn't going to happen for a while. Today's miners will be obsolete pretty soon.
2) The heat you need has to be of a reasonable temperature. Everyday silicon chips don't run very well above 100 degrees C. Miners can heat air in a room, or shower water. But they won't boil water.

I can't speak for anyone else, but I am not interested in compromise. If I accept rules that I don't like just because a few people are throwing a childish fit, then they're just going to do it again and again until they get exactly what they want.
BU supporters can fork if they want to increase the block size.
The risk of not compromising is that an alt (maybe litecoin?) might surpass bitcoin entirely. Personally I think that's a low risk, and I'm prepared to hedge that risk.

I think there's far more work left to be done than most can appreciate.
2027 sounds pretty reasonable to me. 
We don't even know yet how bitcoin can properly adjust to ensure that there are diverse economic interests among its peers. That's why we're having this raging debate over block size. Blocks too small, and the network censors itself (by kicking out those who can't afford the fees). Blocks too large, and the network is censored by traditional powers (if there are only 6 datacenters worldwide that can handle all the traffic, men with guns will show up and pull the plug on those nodes).
The other major issue I see is, today's computers and phones aren't really up to the task of keeping private keys safe. Separate hardware wallets are clunky, and no phone manufacturer is going to build them in, and even if they did, we couldn't trust them.

I have heard that finance firms have ignored it because it's too small to bother with. At what point does it get on their radar? Anyone know?

So this is what it's come to. People afraid to sell bitcoin to their friends for fear of being arrested. 
I think you're safe. First of all, I doubt you even need a license for that, and even if you did, how would the regulatory agencies even know about it?
@_date: 2017-05-31 15:26:54
I don't see the distinction. The point is that BIP148 can theoretically cause harm to people who ignore it, not just people who run it.
Still, I don't particularly mind that risk. Forks are inherent to bitcoin's design - they're painful for sure, but sometimes the market will see the benefits of the fork as outweighing the cost. Exchanges need to have the infrastructure in place to deal with it. It's going to happen, might as well be now. The pain of a split in the presence of unprepared exchanges, will only get worse over time.
@_date: 2017-05-17 16:57:00
I think we should let the fees climb, it'll be really interesting to see where the equilibrium is. Personally I think we're not even approaching it yet. Probably another order of magnitude left to go.
The fears that people will leave bitcoin and not return when there's more blockspace, are quite frankly overblown.

Same here, I found a bug (years ago) in the web wallet where the password field did not recognize that you'd pasted in a password. It would take you to the passwordless wallet instead. Scared me at first because that wallet was empty :)

If you're storing bitcoin in your own wallet, they're yours - there's no expiration. Storing a secret securely yourself is not that easy, which is why hardware wallets exist - they make it a lot easier.
If you're leaving bitcoin on an exchange account, then they're not really "yours" - the exchange owes them to you. If they go bankrupt, you may not get them. I would very much recommend using your own wallet, especially a hardware wallet if the amount you're storing makes that worth the money.

How could the software link a bitcoin payment to the machine the payment is supposedly for? The transaction would have to somehow uniquely identify the infected machine.
I can only think of two ways:
1) Use unique bitcoin addresses for each machine (we already know this ransomware does NOT do this, since there are only a handful of addresses, but millions of infected machines).
2) Use unique bitcoin amounts for each machine (we already know this ransomware does NOT do this, since the amounts are not unique, and IIUC are not even denominated in bitcoin).

In that case, you still have the private keys, you just lose access to them in a secure and convenient way.  You can still import the trezor seed into other wallets and regenerate the keys. It's just that they're more easily stolen that way than if they remain on the trezor.

The fact is that hundreds of millions of people worldwide can run a bitcoin full node at home, even with BIP 101. 
The sentiment (not mine) is "let's make it so we can anyone can run a full node", which is impossible.

Which is utterly ridiculous.
These banks are **already** counting on law enforcement to keep them from cheating. All they need is to be able to provide evidence of the cheating.
Digital signatures do that. Those have been around for decades before blockchains.
Banks have been ignoring this tech for decades that they could have been using it. Personally I think the only reason they're talking about it now, is that they see the writing on the wall - if they don't provide fast, cheap transactions, someone else will - whether it be bitcoin or some other fintech.

"coinvalidation" and other attempts to attack bitcoin fungibility can't possibly work.
Not accepting certain coins is functionally equivalent to running a forked bitcoin client. You don't need to care about people on other forks.

At most, their role will be reduced. Until we all live in cyberspace, the "big gun" will be around.

It depends on what's on that USB stick.
If your actual keys are on there, then you can probably recover the bitcoin. If it's just account information of some custodial account that kept the coins in your name, then it depends on whether that service is still in business (many from 2011 are no longer around). 
If the USB stick does contain the keys, even if it's encrypted with a password you can't remember, there may still be hope. If you can remember anything at all about the password, wallet recovery services can help you. You may want to email them if you aren't able to make any progress yourself. They're well respected.

There are lots of reasons to use bitcoin, and you're right that not all of them require a hardware wallet or complex set up. For some people, coinbase custodial wallet is good enough.

It's not a silver bullet, but I've started to come around to its potential. 
If exchanges started handing out channels on withdraw/deposit instead of plain txs, that would go a long way. And then if wallets started channels on every payment by default, it would not be long before LN could handle the vast majority of payments. I think incentives to be an early adopter of channels would be higher revenue for routing payments (you'd be well-connected before everyone else, and they'd need to use you to route to their destinations).

Ok but then UASF code never activates and it's still irrelevant (since UASF nodes will behave exactly the same as core nodes).
You could argue the threat of UASF changed the outcome regardless, and that does seem to be the case.
I do think there's a significant chance that "some powerful people have a different agenda than the one they have publicly stated." - Bitmain clearly wants to delay segwit or they'd be signaling for it already. You could argue they want the 2x hard fork with it, but their support of segwit2x does basically nothing to help achieve that. It's still up to the community to accept the hardfork. So it seems entirely possible to me that they still do not really support segwit in any form and they'll just yank the rug out from under everyone on July 21. We'll see.

I agree. In general, any device that lets the user install new programs and modify its behavior, is going to be very difficult to secure properly.
On both windows and Mac, a lot of software is installed from untrusted sources (or reputable sources but no authentication is actually done). Windows is just much more dangerous because more malware targets it, and its compartmentalization is (at least historically) poor so malware gets more space to do what it wants.
On linux, at least if you use the distro repositories, you at least have some package maintainers looking after the contents and signing them. You also have selinux, which helps prevent malware from spying on files it's not supposed to be able to read.

There are 2^160 addresses but 2^256 key pairs. So yes, each address has 2^96 keys that will unlock it.

Mining chips would need to become commoditized and reach obsolescence much slower than today (probably would need to produce non-negligible revenue for at least a few years). I don't know how likely that is, but seems at least plausible at some point.
Given that though, a hot water heater with a mining chip would cost less over its lifetime than one without.  A mining chip producer might sell a chip for $25 even though he knows it will produce $50 worth of revenue over its lifetime, because the producer can't power it for free. The hot water heater customer can.
I think the heat dissipation is key to the economics. The assumption is that a datacenter can't make full use of waste heat, but individuals can. Again I'm not sure if that's true either, but seems plausible.

Simple, a settlement layer can't be used for everyday transactions, money can.
Personally I have always wanted bitcoin to be actual money. I'm not convinced that it can scale to become that. I hope it can and I think every avenue should be explored to make it so.
The part that worries me about allowing only large machines (or datacenters) to be capable of running a full node, is that it may be too easy for governments to simply show up with guns and shut them all down.
On the other hand, if bitcoin continues to go the "anonymous mining" route, it may stifle growth to the point where nobody wants to use it.
Bitcoin has to pick its poison. I'm inclined to allow the "datacenter" scenario to play out. Shutting them down worldwide is still a difficult task to accomplish, and if that happens we can always say "ok, we learned our lesson" and start over with anonymous mining.

In a permissionless system, there's no other way to decide who gets to put transactions in order. If you stop burning energy, (or some other resource), then you lose the permissionless aspect, which many find quite valuable.

This gets asked a lot.
The dollar is already "digital" and government controlled. They don't need anything else.
If you mean a government blockchain, what would be the point of it? Blockchains are peer to peer, where peers are equal and everyone verifies everything. If you had a government controlled blockchain, it's not peer to peer! One party has the power to do things that the rest do not. So there would not be much point in verifying anything, since by the definition of "government controlled" they can violate any rule and there's nothing you can do about it. It boils down to a centrally run database which is what you have already at your bank.
The government could ban digital currencies, but enforcing those bans tends to be quite difficult and expensive. What motive does a government have to bother with that?

Why do you assume the fake volume is a result of thousands of traders? The majority of it could be a single trader.
And transaction volume is "fake" if you are trading with yourself. Of course there is no guarantee that you will always be able to trade with yourself, but you should be able to play both sides of the order book and not move the price at all (edit: on average - each individual trade could move the price).

Namecoin is nearly as useless as DNS. 
Two problems with DNS, it conflates IP address with identity and it presumes that everyone has to use the same name for things. In real life they clearly don't (eg "Mom" is a different person in each address book).
A decentralized dns is just an address book mapping names to public keys. And then some protocol where those mappings can be shared.

No. You need to read about how PoW works and why.
There is no economic incentive to cooperate with the network, when mining activity serves some other purpose and they'd do it whether bitcoin existed or not. They have no stake in bitcoin, which is precisely the wrong incentive.
This isn't the only reason, either. The work has to be UPON the transactions themselves, otherwise there's nothing tying "the work" to "the transactions", and nothing stopping miners from re-using work they've done previously, to roll back transactions they don't like. 
The work has to be much easier to verify than it is to perform. The work also has to have an adjustible difficulty (an unpredictable money supply is bad).
There's just no way to do PoW without the work being completely useless for any other purpose.

Just because no one actually traded with satoshi, doesn't mean they valued bitcoin at zero. It only means that the price satoshi demanded was more than they were willing to pay. I have never heard that satoshi ever offered them for sale at all.


Doesn't matter. The whole idea behind proof of work is that the miner has to sacrifice something. If mining is something he'd do for some other reason anyway, it's not a sacrifice.
The reward for mining *has* to come from the network itself.

That's a false equivalence. First of all, legal and ethical are not the same thing. I'm saying eth is used to launch unethical scams, not illegal ones. Bitcoin on the other hand, the MSM was complaining the uses were illegal, not unethical.
Second, the MSM was simply ignoring uses of bitcoin that were both legal and ethical: international remittance, for example. There's no such use case you can point to with eth (at least, none that I'm aware of, and I looked, a lot). Or at least, none that bitcoin does not also cover.

Bitcoin will do perfectly fine as digital gold for rich people (who are willing to pay hundreds of dollars for censorship-resistant transactions). I don't think it'll stay that way for long, eventually segwit and LN will come.
I wouldn't sell because fees are getting high. If you were going to sell it'd be because the price is near all time highs and you want to take profits.

You just meet the person, encrypt a message with the public key of the genesis block. Send it to them and have them read you back the decrypted message. If they get it right, pay them 1 btc. You then know they hold the keys but you don't have any proof that you can show other people.
There may be a more complex way to do an atomic swap, (the proof for the bitcoin), but I can't think of any offhand. The procedure above, you could still back out of the payment after you received the proof.

In the linux realm, pretty much every program you need is built for you and signed by the distro's main repository. You don't have to worry about it containing malware.
The same people whose machines are riddled with malware on windows, would be in total control of their machines if using linux. Mostly goes for OS X also.

Commodity hardware is constantly improving, so it's better to estimate how that will change in the future and only update when the estimate deviates significantly from reality. The current choice is to never update automatically at all, which is like assuming hardware will never change. That's a pretty bad assumption, in my view.

Keep in mind the whole point of bitcoin is censorship resistance. Censorship of money can take many forms: blocking transactions, seizing value (either directly or through arbitrary inflation), reversing transactions.
If there were no censorship, bitcoin would be literally worthless - expensive and slow for no reason. And if there were total effective censorship, the profits one could reap by finding a way to bypass it would be enormous. I believe it's a self-balancing relationship. 
Yes, there's a difference between censoring bitcoin itself and censoring economic activity in general. If bitcoin were totally banned, but you could do whatever you wanted with dollars and its inflation was predetermined, then there would be no demand for bitcoin. If bitcoin was totally banned and the government tried to control every aspect of economic activity, then the demand for bitcoin would be enormous and a lot of people would find the profits outweigh the risks.
Bitcoin will never defeat censorship, because that will be defeating its own purpose. Censorship will never defeat bitcoin, because the more effective the censorship, the more valuable bitcoin is.

I don't see the paradox. We do need Coinbase and Circle to "push out the edges" of the bitcoin consensus, and they do a great job of that.
Some of their users just do not care at all about bitcoin's ideals. They use coinbase as a bank and they are subject to banking regulations. 
I think this will all go away soon enough. The reason people use coinbase as a bank is that doing it yourself is a pain. It won't be long before you have a handy little hardware wallet that connects to a smartphone app. It takes two minutes to set up and you're more secure than any bank.

Why should they? Only two people ever tried to use it, why should they waste more than 5 seconds on it?
They're accepting bitcoin for the wrong reasons. They think if they accept it, people will eat there just so they can pay with bitcoin. That may actually happen once or twice, and maybe in a few places in the world there are actually enough bitcoin fans to make it work. But mostly, it's just a waste of time.
The real reason to accept bitcoin IS BECAUSE YOU WANT BITCOIN. If you intend to just dump it the instant you get it, don't bother accepting it when nobody is trying to give it to you in the first place.

I think the end game is equilibrium between the censorship resistance tool (bitcoin) and censors (governments, anti-competitive payment systems, etc). 
If there were no censorship of economic activity in the world, bitcoin would have no value. I think the equilibrium is where people who really want to bypass censorship can do it (with some work and risk and extra cost), but most people will not bother.
I am doubtful that bitcoin will destroy governments on its own, but it may help shrink them (along with other technologies that make some government functions obsolete). 
I don't expect first world governments to launch all-out attacks on bitcoin either. They won't need to because most people aren't going to bother to use bitcoin in the first place. The bitcoin unit of account might take off, but most people will be using bitcoin banks even in that event.

This is wrong and it's economics 101. 
By this logic, miners would make the most profit by allowing one transaction per block, because the fee for that one transaction would be really high. It's wrong because while that maximizes "fee per transaction", it doesn't maximize total revenue.

Bitcoin cannot have any value at all **unless** there's threat of enforcement and uncertainty of risk.
Imagine a world with no economic censorship. You can buy whatever you want, transactions are not reversed, there is no inflation. What purpose would bitcoin serve in that world? Its value would be exactly zero. Slow and expensive for no reason.
A lot of people like to think "well, drugs are bad and gambling is bad, but bypassing inflation is ok because the government is ok with that". No. No they are not. That's why they confiscated all the gold in the 30's and jailed anyone who resisted it. The government has backed off on their crackdown because it was so effective 80 years ago - almost nobody holds physical gold in significant quantity. If people started saving in bitcoin and not using it for any "less ethical" purpose, the crackdown would be just as swift, perhaps more so.

People *do* expect DNS to do things that it doesn't, because nothing else does it. SSL certificates and authorities are also horribly broken. There is no continuity of identity anywhere. In the SSL system, as a website owner there's nothing I can do to prevent someone else from impersonating me. All the attacker needs is permission from, or to fool once, one certificate authority. Certificate pinning would sort of fix this but no one uses it, and even if they did, sites still can't revoke their cert without losing all their users.

This argument makes no sense to me.
Do we need any full nodes or not? What's the difference between trusting miners' full nodes and trusting (say) exchanges' full nodes?
Once you ramp up the cost of a full node to where 99% of users **can't** validate, then the entire network is SPV, and miners can begin stealing from everyone else. Users will no longer be able to determine truth on their own, and it'll be just like mainstream media, with everyone calling everyone else "fake news", and no one can really tell who's lying.
If an SPV node does need to trust a full node, then that full node must be capable of violating that trust (otherwise the full node has no advantage over SPV at all and nobody needs a full node).

For theft, obviously. If you give the merchant one transaction you signed, and then a minute later a block comes out with a different transaction doublespending the same funds somewhere else, that is theft. 
To get away with this, the miner who mines the next block has to accept your doublespend. Sure he has no direct reason not to (other than hurting the ecosystem). But the miner would also have to take long enough to find the block such that you've already disappeared from the scene. That is pretty iffy.

Cheap and fast are not bitcoin's strength. You're talking about a system where each node has to validate the entire world's transactions. How can that be cheaper or faster than a central database? It can't. Bitcoin is supposed to be censorship resistant. That's why we're not just blindly twisting a knob and hoping for the best. When security is the top concern, software development is a little different than when it's all about features.

I have to admit, now that the mempool has cleared out, BIP148 seems less urgent. I still support it (because basically I don't care if some people lose money on a reorg, the message to miners is more important for bitcoin's long term health).

You used to work at Red Hat, (as did I), so I'm surprised to hear you say that.
Sure, all OSs have remote exploits. But linux users install software almost exclusively from managed repositories, so there's no malware there. Windows users frequently install and execute software from untrusted sources. Windows' monoculture also contributes to it being cheaper to compromise.
I don't know if those two differences contribute significantly to how big DDoS botnets would be, if Linux were the dominant OS. But it seems plausible that it would.

Ok maybe it would help if I explain how I think it *should* work and hopefully you can see why it's superior to what we currently have.
Two separate mechanisms:
1) Distrubuted hash table, mapping public keys to IP address. The software that manages the DHT requires the values that contain an IP address be signed by the private key corresponding to the public key for which the entry has been made. That way, if there's an entry "alice: 12.23.34.45", we know alice herself created it. That fixes the btc-e issue - FBI cannot unilaterally redirect clients requesting communication with "alice", because they would need her private key. And of course, if the lookup somehow gives the wrong IP, it's detected immediately because all communication over that channel still needs to be authenticated with alice's key.
2) sharing network for address book entries (mapping name to public key). I suppose these are equivalent to SSL certs - you sort of described this already, but tools could make this a lot easier to do. Anyone who introduces you to another party shares their address book entry with you over this network. When Alice introduces Bob to you, you get Alice's address book entry for Bob, and the option to use a different name than either Alice calls Bob, or Bob calls himself. Currently people do this really often with google as the introducer - they google "foo" and click on the first hit "foo.com" - they are trusting whatever google thinks is the right identity for the name "foo". You could think of the address book as your own personal CA. This fixes phishing. If it's not in your address book, you know it's not the real site. Unlike today where browsers by default consider literally anyone with a cert as legit. 
As for revocation, there's a reason that's a thing in PKI. Keys get compromised or lost, and some are deliberately created with expiration dates. The problem as I see it is that people (or companies) don't bother to have a locked-away master signing key (or CA) of their own. They just have their CA (which is a 3rd party) issue a new cert. There's no reason to rely so much on third parties to switch keys. If Alice and Bob are already in contact, either one of them should be able to switch keys without introducing any new trust.

Ok sure in theory the government can shut down all exchanges at gunpoint, and then when inevitably some LBC clone appears on Tor, they can get a bunch of men with guns and do sting after sting to arrest people meeting to exchange cash and bitcoin, until the number of people who still find it worthwhile to do that exchange is close enough to zero to satisfy the government.

Sounds like a great hobby, and you learned valuable things about cryptocurrency. It's worth a lot more than the 100 millibits you mined. 
I don't think you should consider this a financial achievement though, unless you live in an very poor area or country. For example, in the US, minimum wage is $7.25, and you could have earned enough to buy 100 millibits in 34 hours of work (roughly 4 days). And you wouldn't have had to spend anything on mining equipment or electricity. 
Granted, maybe mining was a better deal for you, maybe there are no jobs available or maybe you have no simple way to exchange fiat for bitcoin. But still I think the most valuable thing you got was experience.

I agree there are countless ways the government can tax anything with a physical presence. 
However, I think that software companies and other pure-IP companies will increasingly go off the tax man's radar. First of all, not paying any taxes is a huge competitive advantage. So software companies have strong motivation to be located nowhere in particular, and have pseudonymous employees. If a company is located nowhere in particular, which government is going to claim it has jurisdiction? None of them can. With bitcoin, the question of, "what country did your revenue occur in" is meaningless. It doesn't even matter if the government can see the company's webserver is running it its jurisdiction. The company could immediately move it somewhere else. And we haven't even mentioned Tor yet.
Granted, this alone is not going to starve governments for revenue.
I also still think government issuing their currency on the blockchain is suicide.  All that does is put it in direct, fair competition with bitcoin, where bitcoin is clearly superior. They're basically the same, except govcoin inflates and bitcoin doesn't. Everyone can then instantly and painlessly swap their govcoin for bitcoin, and so they will. No one wants to hold govcoin, it will hyperinflate into oblivion.

Good observation.
Bitcoin volatility is self-modifying. If the price remains stable, a major barrier to entry is removed, and new users come flooding in. Of course this completely destabilizes the price, and puts the barrier right back in place.

Hubs used for routing cannot lock up your funds, IIUC. You just use an alternate route - and there will be plenty of those if the topology emerges that I explained. If every wallet is creating channels on payments for which there isn't a channel yet, it won't take long before there's lots of routes. Not only that but I believe that onion routing is possible, such that the routers don't even know whose payments they're routing, so censorship seems pretty unlikely.

Trustworthiness of an internet service has nothing to do with open source. 
First of all, it is not possible to prove that the service is actually running the published code. And second, just being open source does almost nothing to prevent the exchange from losing or stealing its customer's funds. At best, someone might see a bug in the code and report it, but that doesn't mean it will be fixed, and bugs found by code inspection are far from the only way to hack an exchange.

Would take $87 billion roughly. The odds of a single person accumulating more than say, 10% of all bitcoin is basically nil (even satoshi probably doesn't have that much).

That's ridiculous. First of all it's awfully hard to claim to be just an innocent bystander when your laptop has a self-destruct. The disk is encrypted anyway, it's useless to law enforcement without the password, which is in RAM.
You need to prevent them from recovering RAM too, which is pretty difficult to do after you cut the power.
What you really need is a bluetooth device, that when activated, causes your laptop to immediately start overwriting RAM (starting with the disk encryption password, wherever that resides) with zeros or random data. The disk encryption password would be gone instantaneously and unrecoverable.
Law enforcement would be unlikely to recover RAM either, because their strategy would be to preserve power to the laptop to try to recover ram, which is the exact wrong thing to do. The only way would be to power off immediately (to prevent further deletion), and try to immediately boot with special software that copies data leftover in RAM. But they probably wouldn't know to try that.

Roger is not bluffing, he just doesn't understand the game. When I first taught my 5 year old daugher to play poker, of course, she would always bet big because she didn't understand that there was some relationship between the quality of her hand and how much she should bet. She just figured that betting big meant winning big. Roger is like that. Always betting big, on every hand, no matter how shitty - because he wants to win but has no idea how to do it. So of course he's hemorrhaging money.
He got where he is because the very first hand he was dealt was a straight flush. Pure luck. The guy clearly has no idea what he's doing. He's bet big on 3 shitty hands in a row and lost, still has no clue what the problem is.

The only way that re-using addresses is less safe (in terms of possession of your money, ignoring privacy), is in case of a real catastrophic event.  Like, elliptic curve crypto algorithm that bitcoin uses is broken at some point in the future.
When you send funds from an address, you have to publish the public key so that other nodes can verify that your signature is correct. Once the public key is known, and the algorithm is broken such that an attacker can derive the private key from the public one, then anyone can spend the rest of the funds at that address.
But normally, the public key being known is not a security issue.
TL;DR: shouldn't be any security problem with multiple deposits to the same address. Multiple spends from the same address might have security problems in an emergency situation.
@_date: 2015-02-26 00:41:43

Hm, wait, what? I think this is completely wrong.
Mining will always waste energy such that marginal revenue is roughly equal to marginal cost. In other words, the block reward and fees will be about equal in value to the energy wasted. If miners figure out a way to reuse most of the heat, revenue will exceed cost. They'll bring more miners online, difficulty will increase until costs approach revenue again.

I don't think anyone really knows what "adoption" would look like.
It might be helpful to identify groups of people who could benefit from bitcoin today, but don't simply because they aren't aware of it.
I'd argue there's virtually no one in this group. People you might **think** are in this group, actually are not, because:
* There are no significant benefits (people who already have access to banking services, don't face significant censorship).
* The risks of using bitcoin to their benefit (bypassing regulation) are unacceptably high for them (volatility, law enforcement).
* There are benefits, but only if others also use bitcoin who currently do not use it

Why would anyone trust miners to act **against** their own interests?
I'm sorry but you're not relying heavily on trust. Some trust is involved sure, that a majority of miners won't start offering "doublespend as a service" in the next few minutes. Zero-conf transactions are in-person transactions, there is no other use case for them to speak of.
Even if you, as the attacker, had a large miner to collude with, that miner is not very likely to win the next block, so you are likely to get caught double-spending and getting arrested. It's not worth it. 
All miners could start accepting double-spends as a service, but I don't see why they would. At best, it would make a very small profit for a short time, until everyone stopped accepting zero-conf. Destroying that feature hurts the value of the ecosystem they are motivated to promote. 
I understand it would be better if doublespends were not possible, but distributed consensus takes time. You have to weigh the risks - a Starbucks will probably accept zeroconf because the odds of a cheater getting caught are high, and the potential payoff to the cheater is very low.

The chances of you making significant money are basically zero. Mining is now a big industry, and if you don't have a lot of capital, you will not be able to compete.
However, if you have cheap power and want to do it as a hobby, go for it. 
If you want to make money you'll have much better chances investing in bitcoin than trying to mine it.

What does "regulating math" have to do with anything? This is not the point at all.

That doesn't matter. That's just background noise against Willy's steady purchasing of 270,000 BTC. That's 2% of all bitcoin in existence at the time. It's a much higher percentage of all the bitcoin that actually moved during that period (the rest were not for sale).

@_date: 2017-05-15 20:58:07


It implies no such thing. 
Ransomware can generate a key on the victim's machine, send it to a command and control server. Encrypt the drive with that key. Wipe the key from the victim's machine. Show infection message to the victim.
Now there is absolutely nothing on the victim's machine that can be used to recover the data. The code that does the decryption is useless without the key. This is how encryption works.
The C&amp;C server is now the only thing that can release the key, and it won't do it until it's verified the bitcoin payment. 
As to whether operators of the ransomware have any incentive to hold up their promise to decrypt: They absolutely have that incentive - if victims find out that other victims paid and nothing happened, they aren't going to pay. The best way to operate the ransomware is to decrypt instantly upon receiving payment, so that the victims can tell other victims that **paying gets them what they want**.

This is like saying "most large transfers of cocaine can be easily stopped". 
You're assuming a police state, and even then, crime does not cease to exist. Government cracked down hard on drugs, that had little chilling effect because the underlying demand remained.

My response about the car was that you can indeed sell a car for bitcoin and the government has no idea **that you received bitcoin**. Your anecdote further supports this point, since you didn't need to talk about how the money was transferred, just the amount (which was not verified in any way). And cars are among the more regulated physical goods. If you had sold a diamond ring, you would not have had needed any paperwork whatsoever.

There's no guarantee that the sum of the split coins will be greater than if there was no split.
However, historically splits do tend to end up with a greater sum than before the split. That shouldn't happen, but markets are not totally rational. I suspect this split will be like the others, where the sum ends up greater.
Accumulating BTC before the split seems like a solid move to me. The tricky part is to dump BCC before it has some catastrophic failure. That could take days or years, who knows.

I think it'd be easier to produce the signed transaction in electrum, but not broadcast. Then move the signed tx to a bitcoin core node connected through tor and broadcast it. But I have not tried this.
Edit: confirmed you can sign a tx in electrum but not broadcast it. You can then hit copy, which copies the signed tx in hex. I assume you can then paste it into a tor-connected bitcoin node and broadcast it there. Still, this is probably not what you want because your electrum node still queried the electrum server for your balances, so it knows your IP and could still figure out that your tor-broadcasted tx probably belongs to you and that IP.

Yeah, I'm aware of that.
I don't see why anyone should voluntarily pay merchant's CC fees and chargeback risk costs. They already accept bitcoin, you have a choice to use a reversible payment method or bitcoin, and the price is basically the same either way. It makes no sense whatsoever to use bitcoin unless that's all you have.
With the reversible payment method, I can claw back my payment if anything goes wrong on the merchant's end. I can't do that with bitcoin. If the merchant wants me to take that risk, he has to offer something for it.


No he won't!  Why would he offer a discount when everyone is happily paying full price?  These are businesses, they don't give away money.

Here's an analogy I posted elsewhere.
Imagine an olympic sized swimming pool with 50 elephants randomly jumping in and out of the pool, drinking the water at their leisure. The pool starts leaking. Because the elephants keep raising and lowering the waterline faster than they can get an accurate count of elephants in the pool, they cannot tell the pool is leaking until a lot of water is already gone.
That is why the halving is not going to cause a massive price increase for many weeks or months. The traders (elephants) think they can jump out and jump in to get a drink anytime. Once the water level drops significantly, one elephant is going to think "hey, it's getting shallow, I don't want to hurt myself jumping in, I'll wait for more elephants to jump in, so it will be deeper". Then the water level does not rise because that elephant stays out. More water drains. Another elephant sits out. Soon they all realize what's going on. They start getting thirsty. "Better to bruise my feet on the bottom than die of thirst!". They all jump in, bruising their feet, and try to drink what's left before it's all gone.

No, it's a step in the wrong direction. Bitcoin's speculative phase still has years to go, a decade at bare minimum.
In the speculative phase, there is no point in doing anything with bitcoin  except:
1) Resisting censorship (debit cards don't do that)
2) Accumulating as much bitcoin as possible (debit cards do the exact opposite of that)
Bitcoin backed Debit cards are a novelty item at best, useless at worst. The people marketing them and using them have no idea what bitcoin is.

Also, what makes you think that ideal money would win in a free market? Why wouldn't a fixed-supply money (like bitcoin sort of is) defeat a fixed-value money? Or for that matter, why couldn't people remain totally irrational and prefer good old fiat? After all, gold is already available but the vast majority of the population elects not to hold any.

If you care about both though, that would mean that you might want to spend some of one but not the other. To do that you would have to take some special steps to make sure you don't accidentally spend both at once.

Funny you should mention that. That's exactly the type of censorship that bitcoin excels at defeating. In fact, I'd say that without that sort of censorship, bitcoin would have no value at all. (Ok you need a broad definition of censorship to include arbitrary inflation, but I think it fits - it's still taking away someone's ability to trade labor for whatever they want because the value is being eaten away by inflation).

Not necessarily. It can sync and relay on wifi, and only catch up on 4g if you're trying to receive a large payment. Usually if you're out receiving a large payment, it hasn't been too long since you left home, so there aren't a lot of blocks to download.

You weigh the odds that the silver bar is real vs the relative worth of the two bars. The silver bar is worth ~100x more, but the chances of anyone actually giving away a silver bar is very small, probably less than 1%.

The youtube video shows how to do a double spend 10% of the time.

Who in their right mind is going to attempt this? I'm sorry but there are 100 other potential bitcoin-related crimes more worrisome than the in-person double spend.
Edit: You'd get much better odds just taking merchandise and just running right out the door and trying to outrun the merchant and police. At least then you get the element of surprise. If you stand there like an idiot hoping the doublespend works, and it doesn't, then you're flat-footed with no head start.

I'm not disagreeing. 
I'm trying to say ultimately that keeping a 1mb limit is crazy, and can't be justified by calling it a "settlement network". It needs to scale as much as it can without making big tradeoffs. Effort there is not wasted, because layers on top make different tradeoffs, and those will be there anyway.
I would not be surprised if in 20 years or so, bitcoin could directly handle the entire world's transactions with cheap hardware. I think people have this mental hangup that it's "wasteful", but that's just because today's hardware isn't up to the task.

I'm not exactly sure why "instamining" is in itself a problem.
Compare two currencies, one is a "fair start" and the other "100% instamined".
In the first, anyone who wants to acquire some must mine it. In the second, anyone who wants to acquire some must purchase it from the creator. The cost should be the same either way.
What if bitcoin had been 100% instamined but satoshi offered 90% of the coins for sale on day one (Jan 3 2009)? Those 19 million coins would have been sold for what, $100, max? I doubt anyone could argue that the money satoshi raised that way is anything but trivial. So what about the 10% he kept? Well, he ended up with 10% anyway just by being an early miner.
I am aware there's a lot of P&amp;D scamcoins out there, but I don't see why instamining is in itself indicative of a scam. To me a scam is a coin that offers nothing of value beyond what bitcoin already offers.

You could create fake coins but nobody else would accept them. Everyone's bitcoin node looks at all the transactions and coin creation, does a lot of checks to make sure it's legit. If things don't add up, then whoever you're trying to pay, their software will just ignore the "payment".
Some of the checks are:
* The digital signature is valid
* The coins being spent came from valid coins (and those came from valid coins, etc etc)
* Coins being created fit the conditions under which they're allowed to be created
So it basically traces the history of the coins you're trying to send. If it doesn't trace back all the way, with valid transitions every time, back to valid creation of the coins, it is not accepted.

It definitely opens up new problems, I recognize there is no perfect solution here.

Not anyone can reset it. The only way a hacker can take control this way is if a) he has control of your email and can prevent you from seeing the warning b) you don't access the account for two weeks.
I'm sure there are cases where a hacker could successfully take control of an account this way, but it's a lot harder than just stealing or guessing a password.


I'm not so sure - take for example a user who's naive about security, deals in small amounts, gets hacked and badmouths the exchange on reddit. The amount that user generates in fees is much smaller than the reputational damage they cause.

Centralized delivery companies require use of government identity, or an address that can easily be tied to a government identity. This makes it pretty risky to receive items that the government doesn't like.
With a decentralized delivery system, you can receive physical items and it would be difficult to prove that you were the intended recipient.  Think of Tor but for physical packages instead of tcp/ip packets.
The package takes multiple hops, and only the next deliveryman can decrypt the next destination. Anyone intercepting the package cannot see its destination. Even someone who monitors your house, and sees a tagged package delivered to it, can't prove that you're the recipient (rather than just the next deliveryman who has no idea what the contents are).
Of course there's plenty of problems to solve here - in Tor, packets can be resent basically for free if a node misbehaves. Doesn't work too well with physical packages.

If a mining operation ceases to be profitable after the halving, they will simply shut down. They aren't going to throw money away on a guaranteed loss.

Some interesting thoughts there, but my BS alarm went off a few times, especially this:


There's no legal basis for that at all. Running a bitcoin node doesn't make you responsible for what all the other nodes are doing. If I share my own content on bittorrent, does that make me responsible for other bit torrent users who download copyrighted content without permission? Of course not.

Unfortunately it is, and is becoming more so every day. We cannot just assume that the internet will remain censorship resistant, we have to have alternative technologies when large companies decide to start censoring.
Go ahead and try to route traffic across the ocean over non-commercial physical media. It doesn't exist. You can use commercial fiber or commercial satellite.
The vast majority of internet activity goes through a few major sites: google, amazon, facebook, netflix, etc. It's getting to the point where, if ISPs blocked everything but 100 sites, millions of people would not even notice or care.
We can't just assume that our one choice in ISP will always route all our traffic. Net neutrality is already dead in some places, legally they can cut you off right now.

Personally I used to think the 1mb limit was bullshit but I've slowly come around to the view that it's best to keep that in place for a while. I don't find the argument that bitcoin will be destroyed by competition convincing, unless somehow that competition offers the same security with more capacity. No one seems to have come up with a solution for that yet. 
I learned a lot by trying to design a bitcoin replacement myself. Most of the outcomes were either too functionally similar to bitcoin to be worth pursuing, lower security, or had unrealistic requirements.

However it's rolled into the price of the product so you don't notice.

It's not that you're not good at convincing, people just don't want to hear unpopular opinions. Whether they are true or not is totally irrelevant.
You don't sway popular opinion by talking, generally. Anti-vaxxers are going to anti-vax until their kid dies of measles, or is diagnosed with autism anyway, or it happens to some other anti-vaxxer they know.
Similarly anti-bitcoiners are going to stick to it until it slaps them right across the face. That is probably decades away for most of them.

You can lose it all because insurance doesn't cover everything. All that has to happen is more banks fail than the insurance pool can repay.
The odds of that happening are lower of course.
My point was that overall it's the same system (whether you accept the risk of bank failure or pay for insurance) - the outcome, on average, will be the same.
It's only when you start banning cash that the system changes. Now money that would have been outside the system and invulnerable to that risk, is now vulnerable too.

I'm just referring to intent. If you make a trade with the intent of causing slippage, I think that fits the definition of manipulation - you are manipulating the price, with the trade just being a side effect.
If you are simply making a purchase, then the trade is the intent and the slippage is just a side effect.
Of course, to everyone else these two things appear exactly the same, and it's usually impossible to know a trader's real intent.
My point here is that traders do often make trades with the intent of moving the price. For example, they make a big sell, moving the price lower and hoping more sellers will lower their prices. Then the trader buys back at a lower price, for a profit. Their *intent* is manipulation - the actual act looks just like any other sale.

My understanding is that almost no one paid the wannacry ransom, it only has 3 addresses and holds only a few BTC.
It makes sense, the wannacry ransomware is broken, it can't possibly know if you've paid or not, so it will never decrypt. No one is paying.

I kind of agree with him that 300kb is sufficient today, but it's largely too late to shrink block sizes. I doubt we'll ever get consensus to do that.
And I am not convinced that the initial block download is as big a hurdle as he says. I think the reason people are not fully verifying today is that it is simply not necessary. If there were posts all over social media of "miners are cheating! my full node rejects block x but light clients accept it", THEN you would have to just run a full node to figure out whether that post was true.
But nobody is even accusing miners of cheating, thousands of full nodes are out there. No one has any reason to think that miners cheated, today. If people COULD start a full node if they needed to, that is sufficient. I have a 5 year old laptop that syncs in less than a day. I suspect my phone could do it (with pruning) in an acceptable amount of time, especially if you take shortcuts like assumevalid up to shortly before there's any accusations of cheating.

Granted, ebay has the same issue. Large sellers are trusted, everyone else is a complete gamble.
For new participants there should be a "game theoretical" option. For an item that costs 0.1 btc, buyer deposits 1.1btc and seller 1.0 btc into a 2/2 multisig that pays 1.0 to buyer and 1.1 to seller.

There is no evidence that the recent price increase was caused by the halving. Even if it was caused by the halving, that doesn't mean the halving is **fully** priced in.
My assertion (which of course I cannot prove) is that only miners are selling permanently. Nearly everyone else is a speculator or trader who has no intention of "missing out" on the rise to $10k+, even if it means taking a relatively small loss to get back in once the bubble starts again. Bitcoin is basically a binary bet - by far the most likely outcomes are moon or zero. Everyone who's thrilled with a $600 price was out two years ago or more. Everyone left is waiting for much higher prices. There is absolutely no reason to get out now. Nobody's selling without the intent to buy back.
It looks like the market doesn't agree with me. We'll find out in a few months who's right.

My personal opinion is "no". 
If you think about "who is selling bitcoin with no intention of buying them back anytime soon", it's likely miners make up the majority of those bitcoins for sale. Probably the vast majority. In 3 days the number they sell every day will be cut in half. At first that'll just be lost in the relatively massive trading volume, but ultimately all those people who sell with the intention of buying back cheaper later, will find that they can't. And that will start the snowball rolling, it'll take several months to play out. 
My wild-ass guess is $3600 by November.

The 1 of 3 keys is the bitcoin public key, not the key used to encrypt the files.
However, it's true that there appears to be no way for the hacker to easily verify payment. But they don't have to - a victim can just say "here's my payment" and link to a block explorer. The hacker can unlock the machine because he got paid. If that user had actually linked to another victim's transaction, well, the hacker doesn't care, as long as it's one unlock per transaction.

You are way underestimating how hard it is to double-spend in person.
You're the attacker. You go to the electronics store and buy a TV.  They have chosen all their own peers, so you cannot inject your own double-spending transaction directly to them. They make you wait 10 seconds before giving you your receipt. You start heading to the door. 30 seconds at least by the time you are outside and even then it's not like they can't chase after you.
What are the odds of successful double spend, *after* 30 seconds? If you're not friends with a powerful miner, it's very low. If you get caught, you get arrested for theft. edit: it's just not a viable attack - you'd have to have very high odds of success which is simply not achievable.

You seem to think I have nothing better to do that sit around reading everything you've ever written in order to find something relevant to the topic being discussed.
I read the two articles you posted, and there's really only one paragraph that's more than tangentially related to bitcoin. 


Ok so what is your point here? That big blocks are a waste of time? Doesn't this sub already agree with that?
"Keeping bitcoin out of the hands of big players" - what do you mean by this, do you mean "control of the bitcoin network" or "possession of bitcoin currency"? 
If you mean the former, then I think everyone can agree that "keep bitcoin a coffee money" and "keep bitcoin out of the hands of big players" are opposing goals. Sure, some noobs might not realize that, but anyone who's been around does.
If you mean the latter, who is opposed to banks buying bitcoin? I think most bitcoiners would be thrilled at that prospect.
Look, even if bitcoin is a "settlement currency", that doesn't solve anything. Banks will still issue to the people "promises to pay bitcoin" with fractional reserve.

You type in your password every time you log in. If your computer is compromised then an attacker can get your password. This is what two factor authentication is supposed to prevent. I'm guessing you did not use it. It's not really your fault - people should be able to use an exchange without being security experts.
Do you know why exchanges allow any withdrawals at all without 2FA enabled? Because they do not give a shit about security or their customers' money.
If they really cared, they would force everyone to use 2FA. It's simply unsafe to NOT use it. What they'd have to do is disable withdrawals of any funds deposited without 2FA until a) you've enabled 2FA and b) waited 2 weeks. The waiting period is to ensure that if a hacker tries to enable 2FA on your account and withdraw, you have some time to catch it and stop it.
But no exchange will ever do this because they're lazy and it's easier to blame you when your funds are stolen right out from under their nose.

So they make what they think is the non-obvious stupid choice (taking the guaranteed low value chocolate bar) over the obvious stupid choice (taking the "silver" bar which turns out to be worthless).

I wonder what the countdown sites are programmed to do in the last few blocks as 420000 approaches. The timer will get more and more inaccurate as the halving gets closer. Will the clock jump around wildly the last few blocks? What about the last block? It could take 30 seconds or 30 minutes, the timer will be totally useless.
If I were programming it, I guess I'd have the timer go away with around 10 blocks to go and then say "In about 100 minutes" ... "90 minutes" ... etc ... "any minute now".

"Every program can be hacked"? I don't think so. Here's an unhackable program:
print("Hello, world!")
Of course, bitcoin is much more complex and it's theoretically hackable, but most of the possible hacks are not fatal. They might end up giving out coins that weren't supposed to exist, but the community can just agree to fork that history into oblivion and continue. That's actually already happened.
The real disaster scenario is breaking the authentication scheme (the ECC digital signatures). In that case, it would be impossible to tell whether the person spending the coins was actually the person who holds the key. Then all bitcoins would be unprotected and anyone could steal anyone else's coins. It would be impossible to restart because nobody could authenticate to claim their coins.
ECC is on pretty solid ground for now though. It's been heavily tested, and there's a very high bounty to anyone who breaks it (they could claim anyone's bitcoin and as long as it could be theoretically explained by key compromise, no one could be sure bitcoin was actually broken).

I don't know of any attack vector whereby just having the user's mobile account you can access the data on the device. I think Google Authenticator codes are pretty safe even if someone hijacks your mobile account. There would have to be malware on the device to get those codes.
Edit: SMS is better than nothing, but it's not even in the same ballpark of security as an on-device token. The only reason it's good enough for "most people" is that their coinbase account has maybe $100 in it - not even worth a targeted phishing attack. But if you have $10,000 (or more) SMS is totally insufficient. And coinbase I'm sure knows SMS is not secure and they don't care - because it's not their money that gets stolen, it's yours.

Even if there was some legitimate regulatory reason for that (which I doubt), it's trivial to bypass. You just send the coins from coinbase to your personal wallet to the exchange. It costs maybe 25 cents and ten extra minutes. It's a pointless and deliberate invasion of privacy.
I've also been with coinbase since 2013, and I'm starting to suspect they'll be the next Gox. I still use GDAX but I'm very close to bailing out of that too.
Their own employees could not clear up the confusion over the new withdrawal limits. They did not even know whether people who had higher limits now would keep them after the "change".
Their 2FA setup is insecure. (There is no way to disable SMS which is not very secure to begin with, even if you enable authy or google authenticator).

My biggest issue with OB is it seems to be completely gameable using sybil accounts.
Get free rep as a moderator: create sybil accounts, sell to yourself through your own moderator account.
Trash a real reputable moderator: create sybil accounts, sell to yourself with a given moderator, dispute the moderator's decisions. On reddit, claim that the moderator and some of your sybil accounts are the same person.
Given this, I see no way to be able to trust any moderator unless you know them personally. There's also no way to tell if a moderator and a seller who uses that moderator, are actually the same person.
I'd rather see a system with 2/2 multisig and large deposits (5x or 10x the value of the item being sold). Then the buyer and seller had better figure out a way to agree or else they lose their deposit. I know this would result in a lot of hardball negotiation and games of chicken, but I don't see any other way that's not trivially gameable.

I don't know of any way to defend against attackers without a centrally controlled army. Maybe someone can figure it out.
However, just because we don't know how to get rid of the army, doesn't mean that we can't shrink government down to solve only the problems we can't solve some other way.
Most government expenditure is on entitlements which basically amounts to insurance policies of some form. I'm pretty confident government doesn't need to take on that role. So we could probably slash the budget down to a quarter of the current level, no problem. Of course, that doesn't mean you get to keep all that money, you'd have to replace the entitlements - hopefully with something cheaper, but who knows.

Except both ethereum and the DAO heavily marketed themselves as "code is law". Then they turned around and shouted "the DAO attacker broke the law!" when there was no question whatsoever that he was following the code-as-law.
Ethereum promised to be one thing and then did a complete 180. Whether it was democratic is irrelevant - if you were in the minority, you were still sold one thing and given another. That's the real fraud here, not the DAO attacker.

~~Two factor~~ authentication is a mess
Authentication online depends on a user's ability to protect a secret. Passwords are fucked, because each time you authenticate, you divulge the secret itself (instead of simply proving you know it, which is what cryptographic signature algorithms and 2FA mechanisms do). edit: that's why 2fa appeared, not because it's strictly needed.
The problem is that people downright suck at protecting secrets. It's never been all that important -until recently (last decade or so), there wasn't much to gain by taking control of online accounts. 
People are going to continue to suck at this. They need tools to help them. 
Personally I think bitcoin hardware wallets are a step in the right direction. You almost never hear of them being breached. Of course, storing the seed safely is still an issue, but there are tools that can help there too. Vaults (eg bank safe deposit boxes), shamir's secret sharing, slow key derivation algos, can all help. Hopefully someday there will be an open standard and companies actively helping people secure their secrets in meatspace where required.

No it isn't, and I already explained how to do it without involving support staff at all.


They don't have to force them to use 2FA to use the exchange, just to withdraw.


Nope, they wouldn't go anywhere. By the time the customer realized, "oh shit, I have to use 2FA", their money is already tied up in the exchange. They can't withdraw until they have 2FA, then once they do, why bother to withdraw and go elsewhere? They're already set.
It's really not that hard to understand: "If you can take all your funds out without your 2FA token, so can someone else. We have no way of knowing whether it was you or not, so we can't refund your money".
If a customer cannot understand this, as an exchange you do not want their business.

That's the problem right there. If it goes to someone, it's gameable (by the person who receives it). If it's burnt, then it's still profitable to scam when the amount burnt is much smaller than the proceeds of the scam. If the amount burnt is closer to the sales proceeds, then users take a considerable loss just by using the system.
So I think it really doesn't help solve the problem.
I think 2/2 multisig is the best option: For an item that costs 100mbtc, buyer deposits 1100mbtc, seller deposits 1000mbtc. They both have to sign to release the deposited money (1100mbtc to seller, 1000mbtc to buyer). They are both motivated to sign because if they don't, their extra 1000mbtc remain unspendable.
@_date: 2017-06-23 15:39:15
The escrow doesn't really help for in-person cash trades, IMO. There's no way for LBC to know whether he received the cash or not, so they cannot reliably resolve a dispute. Even with escrow he could take the cash, refuse to release escrow, and tell LBC that you never gave him the cash.
It's probably fine for smaller amounts (small enough that the risk of getting caught or making a big public scene is not worth it for a scammer). For larger amounts you need to have some trust in the seller, or a mediator.

This is the problem everywhere. Bitcoin is for people willing to control their own money. There are very few such people, and I would note that these massive crises where millions of people get burned trusting someone else with their money, still fails to change their minds.

From that explanation, it's still printing money - the banks end up with dollars that didn't exist the moment before.
The important point is this thought experiment. What if the fed created a quadrillion dollars, and wrote into its database that Bank of America had a balance of a quadrillion dollars. But Bank of America just let it sit there and didn't do anything with it. Seems to me that it's the same as if the fed did nothing. Technically those quadrillion dollars exist, but they don't have any effect on the economy until they're used to buy something.
Even if Bank of America then loaned that quadrillion dollars to me at zero interest, it still has no effect on the economy unless I start buying things with that money.
I don't think the fact that QE failed to do anything at all, is much of a defense of it. As far as I know that money is still spendable.

Any intense calculation produces heat, which for some is an external incentive. Put a bitcoin miner in your hot water heater, and then the operating cost (edit: of the miner) is zero (you were going to burn that electricity anyway, but now you get a bitcoin reward instead of nothing).

The idea that using bitcoin will somehow get you out of paying taxes is pure fantasy.
It might make it somewhat easier to prevent the government from finding out *exactly* how much you earn. However they will still see where you live and what cars you drive. If that's completely out of whack with your reported income, they'll still fuck you over.
So yeah, maybe bitcoin will make it less risky to cheat a small amount on taxes. Won't allow people to just stop paying them.
Currently if you buy bitcoin and then later trade it for anything with higher value (be it dollars or goods or service), you owe capital gains tax. Anyone who's waiting for a rule change to make it any more favorable, is going to be bitterly disappointed.

While I mostly agree with what he says, the statement that bitcoin will be a settlement network for "large" payments needs to be qualified. 
If by "large" he means that only large banks can afford to make transactions, then I think bitcoin will have failed. End users would be locked out and at the mercy of the banks.
If by "large" he means individuals will have their savings on-chain, then I agree with what he's saying. You want your savings uncensorable and unseizable. You don't need your starbucks purchase to be uncensorable, nobody is ever going to care enough to try to stop you.
Today there is still no solution to get several billion people on board. Fortunately, there's nowhere near a billion people who WANT to get on board. There's still a lot of time for efficiency improvements. I think to onboard the whole world with LN, you'd need roughly 300mb blocks. Sounds like a lot, but my first broadband link was 1mbit, 18 years ago. Now it's 1000mbit for about the same price.

Credit cards are not free to use. Most merchants just steal the credit card fee from you anyway, even if you pay cash. Visa/MC insist on this theft. 
You are absolutely paying 1-3% extra because of credit cards, whether you use one or not. That is not "free" by anyone's definition.

It is not a scam, I've bought gift cards there many times before (although not amazon in particular).
Some are saying these gift cards are stolen, but I see no reason to believe that's the case. 84 cents on the dollar is an extremely high price for stolen goods. Thieves would probably be bidding it down much lower than that, if that's what was happening.
However, it's true that you will probably never know where these cards came from. The people selling on LBC tend to get them from other dealers at slightly lower prices and deal in high volume. I've talked to several sellers there who try to turn over tens of thousands worth of gift cards **per day**. 
I suppose it's possible they're all fraudulent somehow, but you'd think that with volumes in the tens of millions a year, retailers would do something about it. For example, if they were bought originally with stolen credit cards, by the time you received them, the retailer should know about the fraud. I've never heard of any purchases with these gift cards being stopped or reversed (edit: and many of the gift cards I've bought were originally purchased weeks earlier, although many of them also are only a few days old). Seems like a tacit approval from the retailer.
Perhaps someone else here knows more details, but AFAIK the good deals on gift cards at LBC are legit.

How it was halted has no bearing on whether it was halted. The claim on the website was that it cannot be halted, yet it was. So it's a false claim. 
There is a group of people who agreed to halt it. The website implies that the community who runs the software at ethereum.org will not halt contracts. That is a lie.
I have no idea where you get off calling that "pedantic".
I think it's clear that the people who make up the consensus group of the current ethereum software are willing to halt whatever contract a) doesn't fit with their ethics and b) is large enough to impact them financially if they don't halt it.

Exactly. The proof is in the pudding.
If it was so easy to trace bitcoin, it would have been done already. The problem is, if you don't know who owns the destination address, the trail is already cold. The coins have to reach a known destination before anyone can trace backward. 
Sure, if stolen coins get deposited at a large exchange with publicly known cold-wallet addresses, that's easy to trace.
But what if the thief trades bitcoin for cash on localbitcoin? Then you are still at square one. You have to wait for the bitcoin buyer to transfer the coins to some known address. Then interview the guy to find out what the thief may have looked like, etc etc. This is not a cheap investigation, it will never happen, with the possible exception of the most high-profile cases.

The demand for transactions is unbounded as the price approaches zero. I think economically we've basically always been over capacity, there were just little technical hurdles in the way like needing softfork for micropayments to work, dust limits etc.
What happens to the price as the supply increases is entirely up to the people on the demand side. If there's lots of people who are willing to pay almost as much as now, but not quite - then they'll all jump in when the price drops a tiny bit and we'll be at capacity again. If everyone on the sidelines won't get back in except at far lower prices, then prices will drop a lot.

Bitcoin transactions never involve handing over private keys. If you want to receive gold in a lockbox, you don't accept someone else's lockbox - they still have a copy of the key! You give them a lockbox, they put the gold in it and lock it. Then they cannot open it, only you can. That's what bitcoin transactions do.
As for escrow, I don't see how bitcoin is any different than any other real estate transaction. In a "normal" cash transaction, the buyer puts down earnest money - that's kept in escrow and is usually a small percentage of the value, but enough that if the buyer backs out without a valid reason, the seller can keep it and compensates for the lost time and effort. You can do that in bitcoin with a simple 2/3 multisig.
As for the final payment, again it's the same. In a "normal" sale, the buyer hands over a cashier's check or other hard-to-reverse instrument, and the seller hands over the keys to the house and signs the deed over. In a bitcoin sale, the only difference is that instead of a cashier's check, the buyer broadcasts a bitcoin transaction to the seller's address specified in the contract, and then waits a specified number of confirmations.

That was just an example, users would choose whatever they want. Higher deposits are harder to fund, but provide more motivation to close the deal quickly.

That scenario could only play out when the on chain capacity between "now" and everybody's channel expiration is much less than the number of users. There's enough room for 600k people per day even without a hard fork. 
And also note that I said "checking account", not savings. 
Eventually the buffer could get much smaller than today's checking accounts, which mostly settle monthly (monthly bills, biweekly or monthly paychecks). It could go much faster and reduce the buffer substantially.
edit: you're right though that if adoption outstrips secure scaling, there's going to be problems no matter what (including if scaling goes faster than what is actually secure).

Miners are not to be "listened to".  They are hired to do a job: resolve double spend conflicts on the bitcoin ledger. Period.
They either do the job they are hired to do, or they can find another line of work. 
Blaming the developers is ridiculous. Users want segwit, that much is painfully clear.
What you're arguing here is like the following: You hire Joe to paint your house. You instruct him to paint it blue. He says, "no, it should be red". Six months go by, nothing is done. The old paint on your house is peeling off. Joe still refuses to paint your house blue. What do you do?
You tell Joe to go fuck himself and you hire someone who will do the job as specified. The painter doesn't choose the color, he does whatever color the client asks.
Similarly, miners do not choose the blocksize. They do whatever block size the users ask. Users have overwhelmingly asked for segwit. I think there is nothing further to discuss - miners fall in line or get fired - either by UASF or PoW change.

Not really - people should not have to be security experts. Exchanges should enforce 2FA. It's not safe to use an exchange without it, so exchanges are deliberately allowing their users to be robbed, for no reason.
Here's how it should work:
You can create an account, deposit, and trade without 2FA. However, no funds can be withdrawn as cryptocurrency without 2FA (fiat might be ok if the contact details for the bank account match the original KYC info for the account). If a user hasn't deposited anything yet, they can enable 2FA and have full account access immediately.
Enabling 2FA *after* deposits have been made, the user must wait 2 weeks to be able to use 2FA and withdraw. If it's an attacker enabling 2FA, the user can still log in with just his password, see 2FA has been requested by an attacker, and cancel it.
At that point figuring out who's the attacker and who's the legit user might involve depositing small amounts into the user's fiat account and having him verify, or other means (last resort, manual verification by support staff).
If no one cancels the 2FA request, it's assumed the user did it and 2FA is enabled, and withdrawals enabled.

Far less than 4% of people actually understand bitcoin. They might know a few things about it. I'd say the number of people who currently really know what bitcoin is, is on the order of 100,000, worldwide.
Bitcoin adoption will happen fast and slow: fast as people actually learn what it is, slow as people who don't know what it is try it out and find over the years that it isn't inflated or seized.
The former is limited to fairly sophisticated, educated people who probably comprise less than 5% of the general population. 
The fast adoption will happen over the next decade, and the slow will take many more decades after - as individual fiat currencies go bust, a fraction of the people who got burned by them will try saving in bitcoin, find that it works and the idea will spread.

It's kind of annoying to have to use a paper wallet as a passthrough, I believe you can skip that step by using Electrum:
1) Initialize the trezor to create a new seed, and back up the new seed
2) Copy the receive address from the new trezor wallet
3) In electrum: New -&gt; Standard wallet -&gt; I already have a seed -&gt; [enter old keepkey seed] 
4) Send all funds in the electrum wallet to the trezor address you copied earlier
Note I have not actually tried this myself, but looks like it would work.

Ok that makes more sense, although still seems like an extra step : "will you run the software?" Yes. "Signal NYA if you'll run the software". If they lie on the first one, they can lie on the signaling. I suppose some miners might just "forget" to tell anyone they changed their mind? But they can still change their mind again once the software is ready.

It's never going to work well for everyone. There will always be someone who wants to send even more smaller transactions than bitcoin can handle, no matter how big blocks are.
The people who it's working well for now are exactly the people who it **should** work well for - those who are using larger transactions for which trustlessness is a major feature. It's not really that big a deal if a microtransaction gets reversed. So you're out ten cents, who cares.

FWIW I think you're wrong.
While it's true that the poll there is weighted by the stake you have in bitcoin, there's nothing inherently wrong with that. To call it vulnerable to sybil attack is misleading. Normally a sybil attack allows the attacker to **cheaply** create many identities. That's not the case here, they'd have to buy bitcoin, which is not cheap at all.
Edit: by your definition, bitcoin mining is sybil attackable, one miner with 40% hash power can pretend to be many small miners. Well, ok, he can do that, but it doesn't matter. The design of the system is such that the vote is by hashpower, not "1 miner 1 vote".

Yeah, I get that. But I see no reason for a utility company to participate in something like that. They do not need to trust their customers. If they have bad credit, they can put down a cash deposit (essentially switching them over to prepayment).
Having bought bitcoin, or having insufficient ID or whatever, should not be something a utility company gives a shit about. They are not law enforcement.
(edit: I think that's really what is happening here, companies are being deputized as de-facto law enforcement officers. People are not charged with a crime because that would involve real work by law enforcement. Instead they are simply dropped from society with no due process or even an explanation).

Bitcoin is censorship resistant digital cash. The fact that it can't be blocked is what makes it useful. Starting to censor it would make it less useful and less valuable. It's a bad idea.
Not to mention the practical problems of even attempting to censor. Bitcoin has no locality (to ask "where" a transaction took place makes no sense). Whose laws would its censors follow? The correct answer is "none". No transactions will be censored.

A couple points here: I think CPUs are not getting much faster but they're getting more efficient and easier to pack more same-speed cores into a machine. That's still getting faster -I think bitcoin transaction validation is pretty massively parallelizable. Of course there are other considerations like storage speed, which is also improving.
As for violent police states - bitcoin can't resist that on its own, at least not at its current size. It relies on the internet, which also cannot resist police states on its own. Resisting police states requires violence. We can talk about resisting with satellite dishes and stego, but if you're not willing to shoot a goon in the face, and nobody else is either, you're gonna either have to obey, or end up in the gulag.
Bitcoin might be able to help resist police states by cutting off funding, but it is a race and bitcoin would have to win before the police state could form.

I think you're mistaken, I am sure they already don't sweep right away. 
The issue is the size of those sweep transactions. If you deposit 1btc via 10 smaller txs, you're going to cost LBC more in miner fees on the sweeping, than if you do a single 1 btc deposit.
In other words, it doesn't matter whether your dust deposits are collected on the sweep, or on some other user's withdrawal. It still uses more block space than a single larger deposit, and incurs more miner fees that LBC has to pay.

Are you familiar with bitcoin at all? How is someone going to prove to you that they possess $1 million in bitcoin without you knowing their address? It's not possible.
What are you going to do? Accept a crappy screenshot of someone's coinbase account? It takes 5 minutes to photoshop in extra zeros.
Even if you don't publish those addresses, you'll still have them, and after you publish, every goon in the world is going to know you have them. 
I'm telling you, this is a bad idea, it's risky to both you and the people you wish to interview.
@_date: 2013-09-13 20:14:39
Yeah, I had read that ECC allows this sort of thing (adding/multiplying keys) that's what allows people to generate a vanity address for someone else (they don't know the whole private key).
However, correct me if I'm wrong, this requires electronics in the coin, which makes the coin a lot more expensive.  It's ok for a 1 btc denomination, but that doesn't do much good in places where physical coins would actually be used.  Poor people with no smartphone or internet probably aren't going to be carrying 1 btc denominations.
Coins should not cost more than a few cents to manufacture.  I thought about 3-d printed plastic coins where the private key is embedded in the interior and you break the coin to reveal it.  That would solve the durability and price issues.  However this still requires trust.  Also I haven't seen a suitable 3d printer yet for this type of application (they exist but are extremely expensive - needs very high res, multiple colors, and suitable material).

I think it's way too soon for people to do a lot of real business in bitcoin.  The current stage is "land grab".  You don't use bitcoins as currency.  You know the guy who bought that 10k BTC pizza?  That's you if you spend your bitcoins now.  Yes, to a lesser degree, but you're still throwing away value.  
So the only way to employ bitcoins at all right now is as a temporary conversion.  This is even worse than useless because now both parties have to wait for the dollar side of the transaction to clear.  If they just do business in dollars, then there's no problem.

Bitcoin's supply doesn't really shrink. It just grows more and more slowly until it completely stops ~100 years from now.
When they say "deflationary", what they mean is that the value of it will increase. Right now that's mostly due to speculation, but even in a more steady-state it can still go up in value. Basically if the economy grows, a limited-supply money will go up in value - higher demand but the same supply.
Is that "bad" for an economy? Sure, with high growth, bitcoin becomes more and more attractive. But then growth decreases and bitcoin becomes less attractive. So you can view bitcoin as brakes preventing investment in frivolous or useless things.
@_date: 2013-11-13 12:24:15
Yup, I made a similar mistake.
Bought a KNCMiner Jupiter with bitcoins.  They were late on delivery, bitcoin value started to skyrocket.  I asked for a refund and got it, but it was too late.

I disagree.  Anti-virus just slows down your system and while it may catch malware, it usually does a piss poor job of cleaning it up.  The current state of affairs in Windows is, you get malware, your system is irretrievably untrustworthy forever and needs to be wiped clean.  That is totally unacceptable.
And while it may be possible to lock down windows, the default is completely untrustworthy.  When it's so easy to go download Ubuntu or Fedora, why would anyone risk their bitcoins by using windows?
With a linux distro you can usually get all the software you need from the distro repository.  That means it's been built from source, and at least looked at, and signed.  It's a thousand times more difficult for an attacker to get a trojan onto linux than windows.

Not really. The government can simply regulate the fiat side without ever acknowledging the existence of bitcoin, and it will be just as crushing to bitcoin businesses.
If the bitcoin ATM worked in reverse (accepted bitcoins and dispensed cash), the regulators would still be all over it, even if bitcoins "don't exist" and it's just dispensing cash for the fun of it.

People could use bitcoin *today* because it isn't popular enough yet for bitcoin-stealing spyware to exist.  But it will exist.  Why would an internet criminal bother with today's complex scams, when he can just take money directly?
There are online wallets like blockchain.info but that is irrelevant.  If everyone uses that, the spyware will simply wait for you to unlock your wallet, capture your passphrase and send it to the hacker.  Or the hacker could attack blockchain.info directly, modifying their javascript to transmit *everyone's* password directly to him.

They should be pricing it according to their expected sales, they seem overly pessimistic to me.
For example, let's say it costs $100 each to make 1000 trezors.  But it costs $50 each to make 10000.
If they think they can sell 10k at $50 they should price it there from the beginning.  These are pre-orders after all.  Worst case they have to cancel some orders.  If they are honest about the deal from the beginning, it should be fine.
Now, maybe they're already doing that and I just underestimate the costs.

There comes a point where the gains are so high that doubling your investment only gives you a small bump in potential gains. So it's not worth it. For example, if you've already made 10x, doubling your investment will only give you 10% more than you already have. But you've got twice as much in potential losses.

It is not easy to store value privately with low risk. 
You could perhaps order gold coins at a place like  and then keep them in your own vault. However there is no guarantee that the gold dealer will keep your transaction private.

But it's definitely more private than a bank account, and it could be more secure too, assuming you take proper precautions with your vault.

That's a great idea.  But I would think many users of this machine would already have a wallet somewhere, so rather than print a paper wallet, the machine should accept an address (either manually typed in, or scan a qr code).

I don't get it. Once you verify the data, you don't need to keep it for yourself - you already verified it.
So you prune it. But if everyone prunes it, then new nodes won't be able to verify very old data, right? Ok, but that doesn't mean no one can prune anything. As long as the data exists *somewhere* on the network, a new node can verify it. Each node could keep only some tiny fraction of the data and a new node could still reassemble the entire data set.
Storage is cheap. Even with no pruning at all, the blockchain is going to have a hard time growing so fast that it will get more expensive to store.

Trading volume is huge but how many of the sellers on the exchanges are going to sell now and never come back? I would guess very few. When you invest in bitcoin, it's nearly a binary bet - the most likely outcomes are either moon, or zero.
So I think most of the current sellers intend to buy back at a lower price. 1800 coins a day go missing starting today. Over the coming days, those sellers are going to find that they are not able to buy back cheaper. So they will take a small loss and buy back. FOMO sets in. My prediction is 3600 by November.

It's just a way of making a fireproof paper wallet.
A paper wallet essentially is just your private key printed on paper.
The private key is a secret piece of information, but it can be represented many ways. Usually it's as a number, but as you might know there are other ways to write numbers besides decimal (base10).
One of them is base58 which basically is a way of writing very large numbers with less digits (since there are 58 numerals instead of 10).  
Conversely writing a number in binary would involve many MORE digits, since there are only two numerals (0 and 1).

It's actually a really good thing - because heat is pretty easy to re-use in small quantities, but pretty hard to re-use in large quantities. This gives advantages to small miners and helps decentralize mining.
This is why I think attempts at ASIC resistance are completely foolish. I think any PoW scheme will start off with general purpose hardware and decentralization, and then centralize as ASICs get developed, and then finally decentralize again as the ASICs become a commodity. Any attempt to resist ASICs just delays getting over the "hump". All new PoW schemes should be double-SHA256, which is the furthest along in that curve.

Bitcoin is not someone else's liability. I'm not sure why you think the traditional finance system could produce such a thing. Anything they'd produce would in fact be debt (say, denominated in dollars), it would be trivial for any party in the system to override the ledger by refusing to honor the debt.
What if I cloned bitcoin, started my own network, and declared that each satoshi on my network was actually a dollar? My declaring it doesn't make it so. I could try to trade 100 satoshis for a $100 bill, but no one would agree to the trade. 
It's the same with the banks' distributed ledger. It's based on the implicit assumption that their blockchain dollars are worth exactly the same as dollars outside the system, but there's absolutely nothing enforcing this. One bank could suddenly refuse to exchange at 1:1, and only exchange at 10:1.

You're missing a crucial aspect: choice.
Until bitcoin you could not send cash over the wire. You had to rely on a 3rd party payment processor. Now we have a choice. Sure, naive people might not realize the value of that choice and may be tricked into using something worse. Well, those people are always going to be fooled by the 3rd party. The important thing is that now the people who've been paying attention have a way out.

Purchasing *what*? Bread? The value of bread changes. So does gold, real estate and everything else. 
I don't see how it's even possible to establish what "constant value" even means over the long term.
"Would you rather have a loaf of bread or $3.00"?  This is a straightforward question. 
"Would you rather be a millionaire in 1960 or today"?  This is very difficult to answer, because you could definitely buy a lot of great stuff then with a million dollars, but there's a lot of great things you can get very cheap today that couldn't be bought in 1960 at any price. A smartphone, a safe car, various medicines, etc.

The reality is that the average westerner has no direct use for bitcoin whatsoever.

Bitcoin competes with precious metals, checking accounts, savings accounts, money markets, bonds, and possibly other financial instruments.
Personally I think it makes most of them obsolete, or at least, it will eventually. Coming up with a precise valuation probably isn't necessary - it's just "much much higher than $3300".
Then there are the risks. A lot of people overstate (IMO) the risk of people just ignoring bitcoin even though it is superior. I don't think that can happen. At worst, slowly but surely, people will get screwed by traditional financial authorities, try bitcoin, and find that it works for them. At best, it will become "the hot thing" even if most people don't really understand what the big deal is. Reality just cannot be ignored forever.
The other risk is that bitcoin development will stall and some alt will surpass it. I think that's very unlikely too - if there's some clear advantage to new tech, it can be incorporated, and I think it WILL be incorporated. Because nobody wants to see their investment lose value because of inaction on some obvious improvement.
There are risks of attack by nation states, but honestly that's an admission that bitcoin is a legitimate threat and I don't see this happening, certainly not at these low valuations.

That's my whole point, reducing mining costs is pointless.  When mining gets cheaper, more people do it, until the total cost is the same again.  Security does not increase just because a cheaper way to mine is found.  Nor does the environmental impact necessarily go down.

I don't see why this has to be so difficult.
You set the max blocksize so that some percentage of the world can run nodes that keep up.  That way, the network processes as much as it can, keeping fees as low as it can.
So right now, even when hitting the blocksize limit you could probably run a full node on a cellphone connection.  Obviously that limit is too low.
1.3gbit too high?  Probably too high **today**, however there's no way it's going to be needed **today**.  By the time it is needed it may very well be cheap enough to work just fine.
The rate at which hardware improves is rather predictable, the only question is how fast will the bitcoin network catch up to what hardware is capable of?  It may never catch up, or it may catch up temporarily and then get outstripped again.
@_date: 2013-03-12 18:24:57
If you ask me, bitcoin prices will stay volatile for at least several years, maybe more.  Assuming adoption continues, the price will generally keep going up.  But as soon as the line starts to flatten out (even if it's an upward slope, that's fine, as long as it's smooth and not jagged).  That would put it on par with other currencies, most of which inflate at a pretty steady rate.
And no one "brought the system down".  The message was just a message, nothing more, it did not affect the behavior of anyone's software.  Everything that happened was voluntary.  The miners didn't have to stop mining or downgrade, just because the developers wanted them to.

Yeah, at least for now, it seems like cash-&gt;bitcoin atms should be treated by the law as vending machines (not heavily regulated).  For now.  If they become popular I'd expect the feds to put the kibosh on that very quickly.
Going the other way, (selling btc for cash) sorry, it will have to go through a bank.  And they will charge you a hefty fee.  Or it will be just as big a pain as today.
In short, I expect that you will *never* be able to buy bitcoins both easily AND anonymously.  The feds will either have to know what you're doing, or you'll have to jump through a lot of hoops to avoid their regulations.

You don't need tons of space. Enable pruning. I set mine to 5gb or something and it worked fine. 
That said, just running a bip148 node if you're not going to receive payments on it, is pointless. Sure, it increments the node count for bip148 but that is meaningless since it's easy to spin up as many of those nodes as you want, for little cost.

I know the heavy elements on earth and mars and asteroids were forged in stars.  However gold is very rare on earth, and using that same logic it would be very rare in elsewhere also.
The only way for it to be profitable to mine gold in space is a) we have reason to believe the concentration is much higher elsewhere (which if I understand correctly we currently have no reason to believe this for gold or silver), or b) we have exhausted the supply on earth so much that it is cheaper to mine it in space than to continue looking for it on earth.  I find it hard to believe we have reached that point.

I totally disagree with this. 
The voluntary nature of bitcoin is crucial to its success. If two subgroups can't agree on rules, and their pet ruleset is more valuable to them than the union with the other subgroup, then of course they should split. 
Is it really "fragile" just because there might be some temporary confusion over naming?
We need a forking "gentleman's agreement". By that I mean, how two groups should amicably go their separate ways - how to decide who (if anyone) keeps the name, implement replay protection etc.
Of course, one group can refuse to abide these rules and cause chaos, but generally damage is sustained on both sides and so they are incentivized to cooperate on the split. Similarly, we see the damage done to the group when the amicable split is discouraged - constant infighting, lack of progress for either subgroup.

1.1 bits of entropy per character.  Probably less since you said it's 8 yr old vocab.  That's probably around 70 bits, would not be crackable by one computer today.  However it is getting easier all the time.
Why stop at 70 though?  Makes no sense to me.  Just go straight to the "physically impossible, even taking into account Moore's law".  I think it's around 90 bits.  It's not much effort, just do it.

That's a strawman, I never said you should spend small amounts directly from multisig. You can have a plain wallet that you occasionally replenish from multisig.

The hard fork requires users to go along with it anyway, so there's no guarantee that the hardfork will happen with segwit2x regardless of which path they take.
The fact that bip141 is still at 30% does not bode well for segwit2x afaict.

The more I think about this whole question, the less sense it makes.
There's only $2B worth of bitcoin total anyway, so right now there's room for 2 billionaires and no one else.
If we want to talk about some future scenario where bitcoin is wildly successful, and we want to know how much bitcoin would a "billionaire" (by today's standard) have, that's a different calculation.
Let's say in the future bitcoin is so widely adopted that 1btc = $100k of today's dollars.
So at that time if you had a billion dollar company (in today's dollars) you could sell it for 10000btc.

I didn't understand "the future of bitcoin" to mean whether it will exist or not.  I understood it to mean what role it will play in people's everyday lives.
I don't believe for a second that mtgox's issues are their own fault.  Banks don't want to do business with them because of a) the nature of their business and b) the volume of transactions.  There are only 2 exchanges that work with US customers and they are both based in the US.  Coinbase and campbx.  One isn't even a real exchange, just a dealer.  The other has almost no volume.  So their respective banks may change their minds if those facts change.


Believe it or not, a lot of people simply didn't think at all.  Yes they thought that they'd be able to walk up to an ATM and buy (or sell) bitcoins without it being reported.  It'll never happen.  I'm just trying to temper some of the excitement of people who think that bitcoin will take over the world above ground.  That is not going to happen.

Why does that even matter (since bitcoin was designed to resist that, and if it can't, it's probably failed).  Are you saying the bitcoin foundation will propose harmful protocol changes? (backdoors, raising the 21m limit, etc)? 
What are we talking about here?  Why does the bitcoin foundation bother you so much?

The only thing standing in bitcoin's way is acceptance, the technology is coming along very quickly and I think the path forward is crystal clear.
Honestly I think the acceptance path is also pretty clear.  Bitcoin is climbing the ladder of legitimacy.  It started with Silk Road (completely illegal), and moving up through gambling (gray area), VPN's (legit most places), Wordpress, Reddit, OKCupid, etc etc.  
I can also see that bitcointip bot is a great proof of concept.  There's a big market for internet content via voluntary payment (tipping for an informative comment, or entertaining video, or whatever).
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:59:54
Ok, let's say some whole new cryptocurrency protocol is developed that is superior to bitcoin.
Seems fairly likely that the existing bitcoin ledger can simply be ported over to the engine and protocol. Everyone's balance would stay intact.  So then it's still bitcoin, but better (assuming there is no long lasting fork, which there wouldn't be if indeed your imagined engine is clearly better).

Banks are going to end up with a lot of coins. Censorship resistance is expensive and most people don't need it or realize they need it. Banks will offer bitcoin-denominated accounts that are just as fractional-reserve as today's dollar accounts. And people will deposit their coins there, just like they do today with coinbase and other exchanges.
@_date: 2017-06-13 16:32:41
It's not that big a deal. When you do a bunch of tiny deposits, you're increasing the fee that someone else will have to pay on withdraw. This change just discourages many small deposits.
The reason withdraws are cheaper is that LBC can batch them with others withdrawing at roughly the same time. (whereas deposits are not initiated centrally and can't be batched).

Splitting into multiple wallets doesn't really make sense. If you want to spread out access, you can make a single multisig wallet, and spread out the keys.
@_date: 2013-11-30 01:14:34
And that's different than every other currency or commodity?  I wouldn't think so, but maybe someone can verify.
@_date: 2013-03-27 01:46:44
How would that work?  The ledger has to be verifiable by anyone.
For example:
A-&gt;B  1.0 btc
B-&gt;C 0.5 btc
C-&gt;D 0.5 btc
A-&gt;E 0.5 btc
Whether A through E are public bitcoin addresses or hashes thereof, it doesn't matter.  You can still track the same coins from address to address, since hashes of the same address would always be the same.  You wouldn't know who actually owns those hashes, of course, but that's already the case with addresses.
With your scheme though, I don't think you'd be able to send coins to someone using their public address from the ledger, like you can now.  You'd need their public key (which I think the addresses currently *are* the public key, someone correct me if I'm wrong - I don't know much about ECDSA).

The value of a Trezor is mostly it's cool factor, not its actual utility as a wallet.

Bitcoin is an attack on banks and government.  Bitcoin aims to take control and profit away from them.  They are not going to just sit there and take it.  
Take the music or movie industry as an example, they are not idiots.  They know filesharing can't be stopped.  But if they fight it, they can keep their profits and control a while longer.  So of course they fight.  Same goes for banks.

Nonsense.  Even if we all agreed this is a bubble (which we don't), no one knows where it will pop at, nor where it will bottom out at afterwards.
If it pops at 40 and drops to 5, then yes, horrible time to buy.
If it pops at 500 and drops to 40, then it's a perfectly good time to buy.
Or maybe it won't pop at all.  Unless something comes along to stop it, bitcoin is just going to grow against the dollar.  Nothing significant is on the horizon to stop it.  So the price will keep going up as long as that continues.

What?  How the hell are they supposed to do that?
Look, the wallet is encrypted with a password, right?  Let's say they hash that password with a salt and only store that.  How are they then supposed to decrypt the wallet?  They don't know the password!  All they can do is tell whether someone's password guess is correct.
Edit:  I will grant you, that storing the encrypted wallet and the password so close together is so nearly useless that they might as well just store the wallet unencrypted.  If their intent is read-only access (and it is, since they allow a 2nd password for decrypting the private key), then seems about the same to me.

I'm in the process of testing out a scheme for storing a paper wallet.  It uses Shamir's secret sharing scheme, which breaks the key into 4 pieces, which can be stored separately.
Only 2 pieces (any 2) can be put back into Shamir's algorithm to reassemble the key. That seems superior in every way, to me, than having any number of copies of a complete key.
Here's a copy of a browser javascript session testing it out with an unused key.
Of course this says nothing about what should be used to create the key and ultimately spend bitcoins from it, I've never tried armory but I'll take a look.

The more I look at the difficulty reset mechanism, the more I think it's a horrible design.
The "high and dry" scenario is a serious problem - where hashpower disappears and the next reset period cannot be reached before the entire ecosystem collapses.
I think there are better ways of doing this. For example, make block rewards variable, and proportional to how much more difficult the current block's PoW was than the median of the last 1000 blocks. Miners won't spew low-work blocks because a) they're easy to orphan and b) they're guaranteed to have no reward besides fees.
It makes the inflation schedule a bit more variable, but who cares? It's better than risking collapse of the entire system.

On one hand it's nice to see any government entity take notice of bitcoin and accept payments in it.
On the other hand, If they were really that interested in new technology, they would not mind investing in it for more than a few nanoseconds.
They're already converting to fiat immediately, and they're still so incredibly distrustful of bitcoin that they won't accept more than $200 worth.
This has to be one of the worst backhanded complements to bitcoin I've ever seen.
I work for a company located in Zug.
Edit: yes I know it's a pilot program, but I am willing to bet that they will continue to convert immediately to fiat even if the pilot is successful. It still says "Bitcoin is great but I sure don't want to own any of it for more than a second!"

You need to get the address you were paid to from the poker site. I suspect it'll be an address that doesn't belong to your wallet. You probably have malware that alters bitcoin addresses in your clipboard. Always, always visually inspect the addresses you send to be sure they match what you expect.
The other possibility is that the poker site screwed up and never sent your withdrawal. In that case, they'll realize that when they try to prove it was paid.

I agree with you there, but I think we're still talking several more years, at minimum.  In my opinion, before bitcoin can really go mainstream we need:
1) Hardware wallet - to hold private keys in a tamper-proof way that can sign transactions without having to trust the host it communicates with.  Without this, hackers will have a field day stealing money from computer illiterates.
2) some consensus on trusted 3rd party services - to act as a payment network for high speed (or low value) transactions, to do escrow, etc.
and possibly other infrastructure, but I think most of that will simply be adoption - merchants updating their websites or POS hardware, etc.

Sorry, I'm not following.  The only reason to take out a loan in a deflating currency, is if you are darn sure you can get a higher return than just holding the currency.  That's not too difficult if the currency is deflating slowly enough.
There is definitely no reason for a lender to make the loan more attractive, he can't - all he could do is offer a negative interest rate.  That makes no sense for him, since at best he'd end up with less money than if he hadn't given the loan.

I don't think it's possible to avoid double-spends without someone (or in reality, a lot of people) going to some kind of effort or expense.
The cost of securing the bitcoin network is real and it impacts the environment, I don't think that will ever change, no matter how efficient ASICs get.  Because if everyone has ASICs then the difficulty just increases so that they used just as much power as before ASICs existed.  Ok, yes the network got more valuable in that time so it needs more security, but I mean for X amount of security you pay Y, regardless of how efficient mining is overall.

It doesn't even matter if they do. Most people are stupid, they will accept promises to pay instead of the real thing. People do that today with gold. And they do that despite that fact that a piece of paper looks nothing like a gold coin! Imagine when both of them are just numbers on a screen (a promise to pay bitcoin vs actual bitcoin).
The banks will have most of the actual bitcoin and the naive people will have none.

Like I said, tx volume can be faked by miners - they just inject a bunch of transactions paying bitcoin to themselves. And they pay zero fees, because they just get the fees right back again.

Sigh.  If the sentence includes your birthday and name, that's 5 words that are already public information - nearly anyone who has met you either has or can easily obtain this information.  That leaves 7 words.
You may be left with 40 bits of entropy or less, depending on the words.  They key here is that it's a *sentence*, that cripples the passphrase in terms of security.  
40 bits is still non-trivial to crack though, it just depends how much money is in your wallet whether this hold up over time.

NFC (in the generic sense) will happen, eventually.
It's too useful and secure not to.
It's better than swiping because you can't easily clone an NFC device.  It's also harder to hack because the hacker has to get so close to the target device that it's bound to be noticed.  Plus it is just physically easier to touch something than to rotate the card to the correct orientation and swipe it.

44 bits is about 17 trillion combinations.  If the attacker is trying to guess your password online, he has no hope at all, usually. 44 bits is difficult even for offline cracking, but I agree it is not enough for a brain wallet. 90 bits, minimum.

If you think you're fine storing bitcoins on your general purpose computer, do that.

One suggestion I've seen is for the buyer first to record video of the seller saying "I am selling [buyer name or description] X bitcoins for Y dollars and he should receive a verification code".
Then the buyer gives the seller the money.  At that point the seller should release the bitcoins.  If it doesn't, and tries to leave, the buyer can block him and call the police.
At that point, the seller can no longer change his tune when the police interview him.  He'll have the cash on him, and the buyer will have the video.  The seller also can't claim he gave the buyer the verification code, because the police will say, "well, ok, where is it then?"

LOL if you think that password is secure.
Those words are nearly the exact opposite of random, and your delimiter adds very little entropy.
Anyone who decided to do a dictionary attack on names would crack your password very quickly.  Is that really all you want standing between the attacker and your money?
Someone else commented in this thread that they cracked brainwallets of Ayn Rand quotes.  I'm sure the idiot who used that password never would have guessed that anyone would try that attack.
You are depending on security by obscurity and that is a bad idea, and even worse is to recommend it to others.
Brainwallets are a terrible, terrible, terrible idea.  In a few years, a sufficient number of people will have lost their money that this becomes common knowledge.
Any password that is safe is easy to forget, because it's ~~not~~ random.

I'm not sure which part of this I disagree with most.
I never said that just because it's hardware that means it's secure.  I'm just saying that the non-modifiable programming means basically, that if it's been verified secure once, it stays that way.

No, either the bank has control over that blockchain or they don't. If they do, then it's just a database and no different than what they do now. If they don't, it's an altcoin and there's little reason for anyone to use it. In fact, I would guess that the regulatory environment is such that a bank cannot even launch an altcoin that regulators cannot control. Perhaps it's a gray area, but not one that banks are itching to explore. There's no benefit to them.

That's not even the problem. They'll figure out the technical stuff (they'll gain knowledge, and the level of knowledge required will drop as the software gets easier to use).
The problem is, in 1994 authorities didn't really see the internet as any kind of threat. It was another 15 before centrally-controlled giants like facebook took the vast majority of internet consumption. They are not going to make that mistake again with bitcoin. There will be a massive PR campaign to move people onto competing, centrally-controlled products. They may even have the name "bitcoin" in it, or use the bitcoin unit of account. But it won't be bitcoin, it'll be the usual fractional reserve BS.

Yes, I agree completely.  I suspect any competing currency would have to make different trade-offs than bitcoin does.  It is probably not possible to be superior in every way (at least, no one has even floated such an idea, much less implemented it).

I hope you are correct but I am not as optimistic.  Faced with either being responsible for their own security or just using an inferior payment system, they'll almost certainly choose the latter.
It's not that security can't largely be handled for them, but I think that by the time that need is realized it will be too late to start building it.
The only way I can see most people securely using bitcoin today is probably a bootable thumb drive that they receive by mail.  You can't even trust a windows computer to write a secure OS to a blank thumb drive.  Or some dedicated hardware as was mentioned.

You should enable 2 factor auth absolutely everywhere it is offered.  Your email especially.  You might not think your email is that important, until you realize that anyone who can access your email can take control of your entire online world by resetting all your passwords.
I don't know if you read the Wired article about Mat Honan getting hacked, one of the most important takeaways from it was the hacker actually said something like "if you had enabled 2 factor auth, I wouldn't have been able to pull this off".
In fact, I have yet to hear any story anywhere, where 2-factor auth was defeated.  That's not to say it's impossible, it just makes the criminal move on to an easier target.

 Stage 1: value store, aka land grab.  You don't spend anything, you just buy as much as you can. 
 Stage 2: use as currency. 
We are *years* from stage 2, most likely.  The average joe is going to take a while to wake up to the fact that a bitcoin is worth thousands of dollars.

Also, bitcoins are much, much, much harder to steal than dollars or gold.  That is, *if* you secure them correctly.

I think the right way to handle this is to use something like ricochet.im (that hides the location of your contacts).
Install it, post your address here. Then anyone who's interested can sign a message with their bitcoin key like "mcdermottj interview [date] [ricochet key]" and send the signed message to you over ricochet. Then you can take the message and validate that the person who signed it really does have a large bitcoin balance, and you won't know who or where they are.
Then you can continue the interview over ricochet. (I'm not sure that's the best tool for the job, but it's one possibility - whatever it is should probably be tor enabled).
Edit: actually, to improve upon this a bit - the message they should sign should be random text that you produce for them. (I mean truly random, as in from /dev/random.). That way, the identity link between the person you're messaging and the bitcoin account holder is proved only to you, and not to the world. You could publish the signed message and it wouldn't mean anything to anyone else. Only you know that the random text came from you.

I'll tell you one thing I love about bitcoin.  It puts computer and math geeks squarely in the driver's seat.
As soon as a "normal" person (Wall St types included), hear about bitcoin they will immediately think it's ridiculous, and start asking some common questions, like 
"Why can't anyone just make as many bitcoins as they want?"
"Why can't anyone just steal your bitcoins?"
"Why can't anyone just make bitcoin worthless by making a bunch of clone currencies?"
"Why can't the government just outlaw it?"
You know, FAQ type stuff.  The problem for them is the answers are technical.  Most people would have to take it on faith that it works and will continue to work.  They have seen all kinds of scams and are rather reluctant to take someone's word for it when the concept of bitcoin seems ludicrous anyway.
Meanwhile, the geeks get it.  They're hoarding while Wall St types are still laughing.  As time passes it's going to start dawning on the Wall St types that they were wrong.  "If it was a scam or had these glaring flaws, it would have been over by now."

Even if blockchain analysis tells you which addresses the coins are now in (which I don't think it can), it doesn't tell you what real people belong to those addresses.

I don't know where the floor is that will calm the panic, maybe it's $50 or 20 or 5.  Seems unlikely to go nearly as low as in late 2011 ($2), since a lot of real infrastructure has been built since then, and fundamentally nothing has changed since last week.
I didn't really expect it to get as low as 50.  It seems I may have bought back in too soon.  Oh well, hindsight is 20/20.  I still see no new reason to doubt that 1 btc will eventually be &gt; $1000.

This allows you to split your wallet's key such that any t of n pieces can assemble the key and retrieve all the bitcoins.  Let's say you choose t=2 and n=4.  Any 2 of the 4 pieces will collect all the coins.
Think about that.  There may exist physical locks that work like this, but I've never heard of one. Even if they existed, a home safe is not going to be as resistant to brute force as a bitcoin key is.
So if you do this with your bitcoin wallet you are protected against both loss and theft, better than any physical safe.  Let's say you take the 4 pieces and put one in a safe at home, another in a safe deposit box at the bank, another with a trusted friend or family member, another buried in your yard.  
If a thief steals or opens your safe he gets no bitcoins.  If the bank employee spies on your safe deposit box, he gets no bitcoins.  If your house burns down you've still got all your bitcoins.  If you forget where you buried the piece in your yard, you still have all your bitcoins.  If you die, your next of kin can retrieve all your bitcoins.
It's a lot more difficult to do that with dollars, you have to trust some 3rd party that can offer heavy security, they won't do that for cheap.  
If you're poor and 10 bitcoins is a lot of money to you and you live in a bad neighborhood, bitcoin gives you the freedom to secure them properly yourself, if you're so inclined.

Yup, I saw a post about this on google+ - the reason this attack supposedly works (never attempted it myself of course) is because SD tells you right away whether your bet won, before your original transaction is confirmed.  So you can know which transactions to attempt the double spend on, just the ones that lost.

If I were you, here's what I would do.
* sign a message 'I am aliens_exist_1' with your brain wallet's key
* make another post here on this subreddit about how you accidentally sent 20 btc to p2pool and include the signed message
* do the same thing on bitcointalk and the p2pool irc channel.
I think nearly all of those individual miners will return your coins if they actually find out what happened. Many of them use these forums.
The community has historically been pretty helpful with stuff like this.
I wouldn't expect to recover everything, but maybe a good portion of it.

@_date: 2013-04-25 18:49:39
Sigh.  It doesn't matter.  The technique you describe is not random, and does not provide sufficient entropy. 
The *only* way to have a brainwallet be secure is if the words are truly randomly generated, and you memorize it by inventing a backstory for those words.  However that is difficult.
When you get your money stolen, and it will happen eventually, maybe it'll be me that took it.  You'll never know.  Conversely if I start cracking brainwallets, I'll never know if it's yours that I cracked.  (edit: unless you want to post your address here)
@_date: 2013-11-09 18:10:32
Verify the checksum *where*?  That's the whole issue. 
All that a matching checksum proves is that the code and the checksum were either both posted by the author, or both posted by an attacker.  It doesn't tell you which one.
My whole point with this is, you can't just show up at a website to download software and somehow verify that the code is actually signed by who it claims to be signed by.  You need some kind of web of trust to be sure the public key actually belongs to the author.
You need a side channel.  The forums, IRC, whatever.  You can ask "Hey, guys, bitaddress.org shows pointbiz's public key fingerprint is XYZ.  Is that correct?"
If someone (edit someone you trust) says "well, I downloaded it last year and that was the fingerprint, so at the very least it hasn't changed since then", that at least tells you that if there was a hack, it hasn't been detected for a long time (which is unlikely).
This is a problem with public key crypto in general.  If you are developing software, and not using your real identity, it's important to publish your public key as early as possible.  It would help if it has a signed timestamp from a trusted timestamping service. Old email list or forum posts are nice but those can be tampered with too.
Edit: the reason establishing a verifiable identity early on is helpful is because you haven't created anything yet that is worth attacking.  So if you can prove you're the same person who made that very first forum post before you'd even written a line of code, it's a lot more likely that there's no man in the middle.

Yup, that's right, passguardian and the other implementation of Shamir's that I found, SSSS, both accept *any* string, which makes sense because they are general purpose.  So they don't accept numbers directly, they accept a string representation of the number, which you would be responsible for turning back into a number when you decode the secret.
passguardian's js implementation should allow a specific bitcoin use, where the input can be treated as a number directly, (failing if it can't be parsed), and using that as input directly into Shamir's scheme.
Then when you decode using shamir's scheme, you get the number back, which *is* the private key, not some representation of it.  But for my purposes, I'd want the base58 representation of it.
edit: also, when I encode using shamir's scheme, I'd want the base58 representations of the pieces.

I think you mean it's too late for a ban to be effective. Filesharing movies absolutely is banned, and I expect bitcoin to be similarly banned in a large chunk of the world's jurisdictions. It'll be just as effective, that is to say, not at all. In fact it will just punish the jurisdictions that ban it, as economic activity will just quickly move offshore.

I suppose that's true - CSW never said "I lost the keys". He provided a forgery.
However, even if he had said "I'm satoshi but I lost the keys", **anyone** could say that. So this just leaves us with the default position of "this person is not satoshi" because they have failed to provide even the slightest evidence to support that assertion.
Not to mention the fact that it's unlikely satoshi lost the keys. He's not some early miner who tried it on a lark and then lost interest in it. It's satoshi's creation, he didn't just lose interest, and he's unlikely to have been careless. I could maybe believe he destroyed the keys on purpose, but he'd also know that destroys any chance for him to go public as satoshi.

In theory it's possible, but in practice it's probably not going to happen for a while.

I understand the doomsday scenario concern, but for this halving the conditions were not even close to what would be required.

This is purely semantics.  The government could say "oh, sure you can own bitcoin and trade it for stuff."  And then banks will close anyone's account the second they find out they own or traded bitcoins.  That's not technically a ban, but for all practical purposes it is.  Banks have already begun doing this.
Hopefully some small bank will step up and win over all the bitcoin business, but that's a risky move.
I am pretty sure Satoshi and the developers never thought bitcoin would just waltz into the mainstream without any kind of reaction from banks or government.  That fight was planned for.  It's just newbs who are surprised by what China is doing.

Put it this way.  If bitcoin is the internet, this year is something like 1990.  Most people haven't heard of it, but there are some people (mostly geeks) who use it and recognize its potential value to everyone.
Granted, in 1990 the "gopher" protocol was big and now it's practically dead, replaced by better protocols.  That could happen to bitcoin too, but only because it was so useful that people put in the effort to improve upon it.
There doesn't seem to be anything on the horizon set to replace bitcoin.  So, TL;DR no you haven't missed the boat.

As for vetting millions of lines of code for backdoors, it's not going to happen even if it is theoretically possible.

It's a whole class of invalid argument, that goes:  "Because bitcoin has x property today, it will fail because all good currencies don't have x property".
However these arguments tend to never show why bitcoin will never get rid of property x.  In this case it's price volatility. 
If adoption increases then stability will follow, I don't really see anyone arguing against this.  They tend to argue backwards - assuming bitcoin will fail and then using price instability as the reason it failed.
This is really not possible.  If adoption were flat, its price would be pretty stable.  In fact, it's precisely a stable price that **causes** the price to rise.  Because when the price stabilizes, that removes a major barrier to entry.  Of course then the barrier comes back.  But this cycle will dampen over time because after each cycle so far, adoption has increased and so has the price.

Now wait a minute, either the currency is deflating or it isn't.  If it is, then it wouldn't take a lifetime of saving - your savings would very quickly increase in value.  For example, if bitcoin deflated at a modest pace of 10%, you could buy a $200,000 house after saving $10k a year (converted to btc) in 12 years.  Bitcoin will probably deflate much faster than that for the foreseeable future (averaged over, say 5-year periods).
If it isn't deflating, then there's no reason you can't take out a loan.

Note, Mycelium app can scan an BIP38 encrypted paper wallet, it will prompt for the password.  I would just load one paper wallet into it whenever you start running low on bitcoins.  Since it's encrypted you can carry the paper around with you without worry (as long as they're backed up somewhere).

Not really, the OP lost his bitcoins to a brain wallet.  I argued cold wallets are too difficult for lay people to do securely, and I stand by that statement.
The weakest link in blockchain.info wallets is your operating system.  If you run spyware-laden windows, expect keyloggers to capture your blockchain wallet id and passwords at some point.  Right now any hacker that implements this could steal many millions of dollars worth of bitcoins.  Don't kid yourself, someone is writing this malware *right now*.
Edit:  this weakness can be mitigated by using 2 factor auth and the on-screen keyboard.  But even on-screen keyboard is hackable - if spyware can capture keypresses, it can capture click locations, and it's not that difficult to map the locations onscreen to the keys.

My point is that while blockchain.info wallets are pretty secure, it is still trusting blockchain.info not to accidentally distribute hacked javascript that captures your key.
The best way to store your nest egg is a cold wallet, which is still difficult to do securely.  If you're careful with blockchain.info, it's probably good enough.  But verifying that the blockchain wallet software is "pure" is not something the general public can do.

Yeah, I had been hopeful for a while that government would allow bitcoin to exist in legitimate business.  
That's as likely to happen as the government allowing Napster to exist.  The Napster head was sliced right off, and that is exactly what will happen to *every last bitcoin business* that pokes its head above ground far enough to be noticed.
Filesharing didn't fail just because Napster got obliterated.  It just went underground and flourished.  Same will happen with bitcoin.
Edit:  I'm not suggesting that the government will necessarily ban bitcoin outright, I would expect it would probably still be legal to accept bitcoin in exchange for goods and services.  Watch out for the taxman, though, he'll be watching bitcoin carefully and will make examples out of little guys who don't report income.  But it will not stay legal to accept bitcoin in exchange for other currency.  The regulatory bar will simply be raised higher and higher until nobody can reach it profitably.

I don't see how this is a scam.  If you want to buy or sell bitcoin at x price, that's what the exchange gives you.
The market price not what *everyone* thinks a bitcoin is worth, it's the last price a sale was made at.  The order book is full of people who disagree with the "market" price. If you keep that in mind, then most market "manipulations" cease to work on you.

Yes I agree.  At first I thought the bitcoin devs left us with an incomplete system, because of the lack of instant payments.  
However now I see that there is probably no solution that satisfies all those requirements, instantaneous non-reversible payments has to involve a trusted 3rd party.  So that is probably not the bitcoin devs' role to deliver.
I do wonder though, what will end up in that space.  I hope consumers will have a choice to not pay insurance fees, since largely those fees are a scam - they are too expensive for the amount of protection they provide.  Mostly the fees protect the payment processors, not the consumer.

Open source has nothing to do with it.  The reason smartphones or laptops are bad for securing your private key is because they are general purpose.  Their behavior is easy to change, whether by you (installing apps) or a hacker (installing a keylogger).

In the US at least, bitcoin as a free (as in speech) and legal means of exchange, is walking dead.  Legal ATMs and exchanges that don't spy on their users will never happen here.
Fortunately bitcoin's design anticipated this, so the government's actions only slow the inevitable.
Remember "strong encryption" was initially classified as a munition and the US government tried to tightly control it, jailing people for "exporting" ideas.  They did some damage and ruined some lives but ultimately they failed.
They'll fail to control bitcoin too.

Bitcoin price is not going to stabilize until the land grab is over.  That is probably a long way off.   I think it will get there via a slow bootstrapping process, where each bubble/bust cycle reaches new levels of adoption and stability.
The current bitcoin "alternatives" aren't alternatives at all.  They are clones that lack any real innovation or mindshare, and they will never catch up.  They are doomed to fail.  However I don't mean to say that any possible alternative is doomed, just the current ones.

However much I want, but probably not much more than what I keep in my normal wallet today.  Replenishing it from a larger account is another topic, but it could work similarly (a 2nd hardware wallet you keep in a safe perhaps, or other cold storage).

There is no smallest atomic amount, at least not a permanent one.  Right now a bitcoin is divisible into 100,000,000 parts but it's been said from the beginning that there is room in the protocol to make it even more divisible if necessary.

The storage of the blockchain is the *least* of the scaling problems.  It currently costs just a few dollars for the capacity to store the blockchain, and the cost is decreasing (because drive capacities increase much faster than the size of the blockchain).  It will likely *never* cost more to store, than it does today.
Now, indexing and accessing all that data might be a different story.  
And also, you can't just dismiss orphaned blocks as if miners don't care, that is the difference between profit and loss for them.  By increasing a miner's orphan rate, you essentially knock him out of the business.  
Overall though, I agree with you that the scaling problems are temporary at most - maybe not even a problem at all, depending on how fast the transaction rate grows.

Welcome to the wild west!   
There's lots of money to be made, but there's lots of pitfalls you have to navigate around.  None of the existing exchanges are very well run compared to traditional financial institutions.  It may look like there are easy opportunities, but they often turn out to be a lot more complicated than they look.  And there are risks you wouldn't normally worry about with traditional investments.
For example, arbitrage.  Looks easy, but moving fiat around quickly is not.  If you try it with mtgox, you're stuck for months on the first round.
Another example, these dips of 15% or more - easy to make money IF you have orders already on the exchange's books when they occur.  When the craziness starts it's often too late to place an order because of lag.  You basically need an API bot, or at least update your orders often.

Altcoins are not relevant and probably never will be.
Physical coins have a long way to go before they see real use.  Currently they are just for novelty, they can't withstand bouncing around in people's pockets for a decade.  And of course it requires a trusted party to produce the coins.  Honestly that's less of a problem than producing cheap, durable, and tamper-proof coins.

If you are interested in buying bitcoin anonymously, there are really only 2 options - localbitcoins.com and the  IRC channel.  OTC is pretty difficult to set up, I would recommend localbitcoins.
However if you don't care if someone knows you bought bitcoin (most people don't), then you can use coinbase.
A separate issue is whether you should leave your bitcoins in coinbase's wallet.  It's safe there for the short term.  But I suggest you learn how to create your own wallet and keep it safe.  Just be honest with yourself as you go along, about who's more likely to be hacked or make a mistake - if it's you, then stick with coinbase. 
Edit:  yes, the bitcoins you buy on coinbase would have the same value as any others.

You were an idiot.  Don't compound your idiocy by throwing away 240 bitcoins.  They are probably recoverable.  You just need someone to loan you the money for the recovery.  Lets say it costs $1000.  Many people would happily pay the recovery bill in exchange for 10% of whatever is recovered (which will be either 24btc or nothing).  Heck, some people would probably risk it for less than that.

That's definitely true.  They claim to care about security and have done audits, which is a good sign, although not exactly proof of security.  And funding is pretty straightforward, although honestly no faster or easier than MtGox.  They seem to have weathered the ddos attacks pretty well.  The site got a bit slow, but still quite tolerable.
The drawbacks are the tiny market depth, and the UI.  Although I admit that all you have to do to get around the UI problem is just open another window with bitcoincharts.

This is just utterly wrong.  If bitcoin becomes popular, expect bitcoin stealing malware on every major mobile OS.
That means, there will be malware on your iphone that captures your blockchain.info password and steals your bitcoins.
There is absolutely no way to prevent this.  Hardware wallets are the answer.  There is no vector for malware to get onto the device, so there will be no way to steal the key except perhaps by disassembling the device.  And for that you have to have physical possession of it, and even then it is difficult.

There are various providers of online identity (google, twitter, facebook, etc), so this isn't a huge problem to get past.

The increase in value and the divisibility are not causally related, at least not directly. 
If the developers announced tomorrow that "bitcoin now has 16 decimal places!" I don't think the price of a bitcoin would change at all.  And as we've seen there is no causal relationship the other way either - the volatile price changes haven't caused any changes in divisibility.

Maybe you want to be able to send quick cheap irreversible payment to anywhere in the world.  The local bitcointip bot is a good example of something you can do with bitcoin but not a debit card.  Or you want to buy drugs, or you want to speculate on its future value.  Many reasons, really, aside from trying to buy skittles with it, which I think is a pretty dumb thing to do, currently.

These sorts of attacks are very difficult to pull off, and when they fail, the attacker simply loses the money (in other words, it ends up as a regular payment, but the recipient can see a double spend was attempted).
For everyday purchases this sort of attack is not viable at all, IMO.  That is, assuming the merchant takes some basic precautions.
And of course for large purchases (say a car or a house), waiting for a confirmation (or several) doesn't seem overly restrictive.  Those sorts of purchases normally take a long time anyway.

You have to compare the risks. The one you're talking about basically never happens, but users losing control of their single-sig key happens all the time, there have been literally thousands of posts on this subreddit where that happened.
I can't think of a single wallet bug where it sent miners a huge fee. That has only happened when users try to construct txs manually. 
I also cannot think of a wallet bug where it made funds irretrievable when there was good key material already. There have been a couple of wallet bugs where it generated keys that weren't actually random. But multisig would protect you there too (assuming you don't use the same wallet impl for all the keys). And you can avoid that altogether by generating keys however you like and importing them into the wallet.
You also have to remember that it's ok to have separate *keys*. I'm talking about how to distribute secret material to different locations. You can have more than one key per location. I'm just saying that you should set it up such that compromise of a single location does not lead to loss of funds. To do that, you use multisig.

By creating a bitcoin-friendly bank you are no longer asking permission from one unfriendly group (a bank), but instead another (banking regulators).  Either one will potentially revoke that permission, on a whim.
I imagine that many potential bitcoin users would probably prefer the convenience of this route, versus one that doesn't ask permission from anyone (decentralized exchange, bitcoin ATMs etc).
However the one that doesn't ask permission will likely be the last one standing.

Who cares how it "looks"?  Bitcoin is a public system, by design everyone knows what's happening, bugs and all.

Yeah, not having a side channel sucks.  
What I'd recommend for people starting projects is to have your public key signed by a timestamping service like  **before** you make your project public.  The earlier, the better.
That way, you can prove that this public key existed before anyone even knew about your project or had any motive to attack it.
Even that doesn't help with newbs who only do validation if the website tells them to.  An attacker can just strip out all mention of validation and they'd get owned.

Worst case (and I don't think this is unrealistic at all), there won't be any legitimate business done in bitcoin, in China or the US or Europe, in five years.  Not because bitcoin is dead by then, but because banks and government will have mobilized and "eliminated" the threat to their profit and control.
However it won't really work.  Bitcoin will still live on underground, and its resistance to regulation will increase dramatically.  Slowly it will start clawing its way back up the ladder of legitimacy.  How far back will it make it?  Who knows.  But even if it stays underground forever, bitcoin is still undervalued today.

I'm a huge fan of bitcoin, don't get me wrong.  However, after the last few days, I am not convinced that what bitcoin needs now is popularity.  It's already more popular than it's ready to be.
Just looking at all the "not terrible but still not good" advice I see people giving about how to store bitcoins securely, I know all these newbies just hoping to make a quick buck are going to lose their money.
That is not good for bitcoin.  
All the traffic coming to the blockchain before developers have even decided what to do about the 1mb block limit is not good either.
Again, don't get me wrong, I'd rather see irrational exuberance than apathy.  But if bitcoin needs something right now I don't think it is promotion.  It's all over the news.  In the last 3 days, nearly every major media outlet has covered it.  
Edit: in the interest of making bitcoin better, I'm working on a pull request for bitaddress.org that adds the option of Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme to key generation.  I think that secret sharing is absolutely critical to safe storage of a high-value wallet.  It's superior to ordinary paper wallets and brain wallets in nearly every way.

Or they would just do nothing because the government would never be able to tell who is keeping a bitcoin wallet.
The government buying bitcoins is just like anyone else buying them.  If they also make them illegal, people will have to decide what level of risk they want to take.  But given technological realities, that risk is very very low.  The punishment would have to be very harsh for people to even consider changing their behavior.

I'm actually doing something similar.
Here's what I did.  
But I used Fedora 19's LXDE build (lightweight).  
You can use almost any linux distro though, whatever's easiest for you.
During the install, I just edited the partition info manually, marked /home as encrypted.  The rest you can probably leave in the clear for performance reasons, as long as you keep sensitive files in your home dir.  However if you want to be paranoid, just make one big encrypted partition on /.  I removed the swap partition since I have plenty of RAM.
I definitely would recommend booting from a USB stick instead of using a VM.  It's about the same effort and it's more secure.

Answer is still "NO".
Just like if I want a self driving car, I don't care if Ford doesn't want to build one. If I can find a Tesla that drives itself, I'll buy that. If it's easier to join an organized boycott of Ford to get them to change their mind, I'll do that.

If you think you might make a move, keep cash ready. Makes sense to me.

It's pretty complicated to say whether bitcoin has "intrinsic value".  The payment system, the unit of account, and the network effect are all tied together to give bitcoin value.  None of those have much value by themselves.  This is the mistake a lot of media analysts are making.  If take bitcoin's value strictly as a payment system, it's very low (since it can be infinitely cloned at will).  Same goes for its unit of account (why use a unit that's not widely accepted and not legal tender anywhere).  And finally just because bitcoin is used more than other similar systems doesn't automatically give it value either.  Looking at those 3 things separately, bitcoin would seem worthless.
However I still agree that bitcoin is not fiat.  No one declared anything about bitcoin.

Yeah, I guess I was assuming it wasn't spam, but I'm not sure how that would work.  Ultimately my point was that if I hated my ISP and there was a better one, I don't think they'd even need to advertise to me, I'd find out about it.  That would probably be the case for anyone who gave a crap about getting "real internet" instead of a branded version.

Meh.  You could have said the same thing about the internet 25 years ago.  In some countries the free internet *is* banned but a) the filters are pretty easily circumvented and b) that doesn't affect the overall success of the internet.
I don't foresee any government that allows free (as in speech) internet banning bitcoin either.  I'm not seeing how being paid in bitcoin is any different (tax wise) than being paid in cash.  Lots of people are paid in cash already, the government hasn't tried to ban that.
I think that like the internet, by the time those in power realize the true potential and gather forces to destroy or take over bitcoin, it will be too late.  No US politician (for example) can sponsor a bill making the internet illegal, it's political suicide.

Even if bitcoin is only used for gambling, porn, drugs, sex toys, etc - that market is enormous compared to the current market cap.  If everyone who consumes those products even *knew* about bitcoin, much less all used it, bitcoins would be selling for orders of magnitude more than their current value.
Given the nature of bitcoin, I don't expect "everyday" businesses to start accepting them for years.  Why the hell should anyone spend their bitcoins *now* on groceries, given how in-demand they might be very soon for buying drugs, porn, gambling, sex toys, etc, and given how easy it is to buy groceries with fiat currency?

Interesting, as curious as I am who Satoshi really is, he wanted to be anonymous.
On the one hand, he must have known that bitcoin people would also be interested in investigating his true identity (both for the challenge, and curiosity).  On the other hand, he did give us something pretty valuable for free, maybe we should do him the courtesy of letting him remain anonymous.  
I don't think it's far fetched to say that if his identity is revealed, he could eventually end up in prison.  Aaron Swartz was facing decades in the clink just for making copies of some obscure academic papers.  Imagine what the US justice system would do to someone who subverted the almighty dollar.

I think it's precisely *because* Apple is so big that their attempt to profit off bitcoin would fail.  Their revenue swamps bitcoin's market cap.  The vast majority of bitcoin buyers would be Apple customers, so Apple would get the bitcoins right back.  They'd have no one to sell to.
The only way Apple could profit is the same way you or I could:  by bitcoin's market cap growing *aside* from our own holdings.

It seems like there must be a technological solution, right?  
I already implicitly trust the satoshi client (by downloading it and running it, I vote to play by its rules).  If it was distributed with a summarized version of all but the last x blocks signed by core devs, and a checkbox whether to just trust the summary or download the full chain, I'd just trust the summary.  Something like that would help the storage size (but not the bandwidth, which is probably a more pressing problem). 
For the bandwidth, I am not sure.  Miners do need to know about every transaction, but I'm not sure why bandwidth matters that much.  If visa processes 10k transactions/sec and each one is 1kb, a connection carrying 10mB/s is enough to receive them all.  That's not even that hard to get today, much less by the time bitcoin has the same volume as visa.  So people couldn't mine on a 3g connection, so what?  They can't mine on cpus anymore either.

My point was that it is useless to go to bitaddress.org (or any site that hosts software) and say "hey, the key on that SAME DOMAIN signed the software, so I'm good!"  That signature, by itself, is worthless.
The only way it has any value at all, is if you can somehow independently verify that the key actually belongs to the author.
Otherwise, if an attacker can compromise the host to change the software, he can also replace the public key with his own and sign the software himself.
There is absolutely no way for a new user to just go to some website and verify anything himself.  He'd need to check with the community that the key he sees is the same one that's been in use since the inception of the software.

All this tells us is that a very naive double spend attack won't be successful.  A real double spend attack involves choosing who you peer with on the network.  You should peer with your target, in order to get him the transaction you ultimately hope will "lose" very quickly.  And you should peer with other well-connected nodes as far from your target as possible.
For a more in-depth analysis you could have just read the bitcoin wiki on double spends and found this paper:

I agree, if any altcoin gains traction, it will not be any that currently exist.
None offer any real innovation.  At best, they do a different trade-off than bitcoin does.  Bitcoin made pretty good choices there, so it's nearly impossible to tradeoff and end up better overall.
I think all altcoins that currently exist will be dead in a few years.  Once it becomes clear they aren't making any headway, they will collapse.  And once the first round of altcoins collapse, none will take their place unless they have something truly new to offer.

It depends on the level of risk you are willing to take.  That's why everyone keeps saying "only invest what you can afford to lose", because it's risky.
If you're 23 years old and have a small amount of life savings, risking it all on bitcoin isn't such a terrible idea.  If you lose it, you have many years to earn it back.
Personally I agree with Mark Cuban, "diversification is for idiots".

You may be right, the way the exchange sets up its wallet could probably be made to have virtually no mixing at all.  Mixing ties up all funds that go through the exchange into one big hairball, which is easy to blacklist.  That's what most exchanges seem to do currently, because it doesn't matter (yet).

Is it even possible to use these for signing bitcoin transactions?  From what I read, the secure element in the phone is controlled by the manufacturer, not the user.  If people want to use that as a hardware wallet, they're going to be waiting a long time for eg Samsung to offer it.
I read that SD cards also contain these chips but, haven't seen any effort underway to utilize them.

I think this is the point that a lot of people don't get.
The ledger of who owns what can't be killed.  It may turn out there's some horrible flaw where hackers are able to steal coins.  Ok, fix the bug, and come to consensus again on where the last known secure block was, and continue.
There's only 1 scenario I can think of where this might not work - if the flaw is found by some government agency, who deliberately starts polluting the ledger very slowly and lets it go on for a very long time.  Then it's too late to roll back, and not even obvious where to roll back to even if you could.
However that would require that no one detects the pollution, that just seems extremely unlikely.

They think "well, that's not a fair comparison".  Of course it is!  It's not like we're comparing buying gold with buying silver.  We're comparing **mining for gold** with buying gold.

Blockchain.info could also be considered an "online wallet", even though they only store an encrypted version of your key.

I'm not so sure.  Saving would be a lot easier, so that would offset the difficulty of starting a business.  But I do imagine that the lack of instant capital would make it harder to do some things, on the other hand it would also reduce wasteful spending.  Is it better overall?  I certainly don't know, but seems worth finding out.
@_date: 2013-03-06 02:22:10
Yeah, it concerns me also.  I think that there is some balance between cheap transactions and miner profit that will end up working fine.  However it still has to be designed and implemented.
I know Jeff Garzik posted on his blog that he imagined the change (if there is to be one) being a "if date &gt; futuredate then maxblocksize = [some larger number]" sort of fix.  That way nearly everyone would have the bitcoin client with the change in it, by the time "futuredate" arrives.  
I'm fine with that sort of fix too.  It's not elegant but it works, and personally I'd rather see a fix that is inelegant but safe.
I think chances are good that developers will get it right.  It's one of the bigger risks to the network, though, in my opinion.

As for how to do that - (it's enough effort that you should really just use this to store large amounts - whatever 'large' means to you) -
Unless you fully trust your OS and browser, I'd recommend booting some linux distro off a USB key.  It's easy (I like fedora but there are others): 
Then you can generate a key and be confident no spyware has read it and sent it anywhere
This will generate a new key using your browser.  As soon as the page loads you can disconnect your computer from the network.  Print out the wallet.
You can get even more theft and loss proof, by using Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme.  I split my key into 4 parts where any 2 can be combined to produce the key again.  I store them in different locations to protect against theft, house fire, snooping, etc.
@_date: 2013-12-05 21:09:23

Seems like it should be straightforward to write a marketplace app *on top* of bitmessage.
I'm not an expert on bitmessage, but my understanding is that messages are passed encrypted to all nodes, and each node just decrypts what it has the key for.
So a marketplace just creates its own keypair(s) and publicly distributes both public and private halves, so that anyone can post messages to the marketplace (place ads, bids, etc).  
Of course, someone has to do escrow, there's no way around that.  So you need a trusted 3rd party for that, but that's the case Silk Road or ebay or any online marketplace.

Just the opposite.
Banks everywhere should believe that bitcoin users are scared of banks and are out to crush them.
@_date: 2013-04-23 17:38:34
Simple.  Lots of online websites offer ACH withdrawal, for which you only need to know the bank account number (plus the routing number for the bank, which is public information).  Banks actually do a bit more checking than that, but it doesn't always work.
Coinbase is one of those websites, and a thief would very much prefer to just take your cash directly, rather than spending it on something that he doesn't want, and risking being caught by having merchandise shipped to a physical address.
By using coinbase, he gets someone else's money and almost no risk of being caught.  Coinbase tries very hard to detect this fraud but sounds like they missed it in your case.

If you think PR is going to prevent bitcoin from being outlawed, you are very mistaken.

Bitcoins cannot be created out of thin air.  Only promises to pay bitcoin can be created out of thin air.  By creating more promises to pay than there are bitcoins (because of interest), defaults must happen.  
Let's say it's 2140 and all the btc have been mined.
I loan you 20 btc at 10% interest.  That means 1 year from now you owe me 22 btc.  Now let's say 1 million people take out the same loan from someone else.  They borrow 20 million btc and have to repay 22 million btc.
But there aren't 22 million btc and there never will be.  So at least 50,000 people lose the game of musical chairs, and must default eventually.  If they borrow to pay back a loan, that just creates even more interest that can never be repaid.
@_date: 2013-07-09 23:28:56
Well it's a matter of degree. The machine owner isn't necessarily the store owner. The more steps the government has to take to connect you to bitcoins, the better off you are. ATMs add a layer of indirection.

If they are interested in bitcoin as an investment, they can buy some now and learn how it works later.  They do need to know how to store it securely though, even that is pretty technical.  
My advice to nontechnical people who want to invest, either dig in and learn the technical material, or find someone who knows it to help you.  There's no way to dumb it down.  It's hard.

Sorry to say, but DPR was an idiot if forensics really recovered his wallet.  I don't care what explanation you give, many of us here with less than 1/1000th the cash he had, used better security.  
All DPR had to do was boot a linux USB key, and generate a brain wallet.  That would have foiled probably any forensics even the FBI could manage.  Not that difficult.
Edit:  The keylogger resistant brain wallet program would simply convert the seed to a list of random words for you, so you would never have to type them anywhere.

Yeah, I know it's not strictly necessary.  Just seems pretty inelegant to take the key (which is a number) turn it into a base58 string, then turn that into a number, split it with shamir's algorithm, then take those several numbers, and then turn them into a base16 strings, and then turn those into numbers, and then turn those into base58 strings.
Ideally the key should stay a number until the end, then base58.   key directly into shamir's algorithm, then base58 the results.

Not quite.  Smartphones used to store bitcoin keys would quickly be overrun by bitcoin-stealing spyware.  
It's going to be a separate, single purpose device, a hardware wallet.  It only needs to store the key securely, show the user what is being signed, accept a PIN from the user to confirm, and transmit the signed transaction (perhaps via NFC or other short-range radio).
Someone is already working on this.

I don't understand how mining speeds are calculated.  It's not like every miner is counting their hashes and sending them to some central repository.

The land grab is on.  No one's going to spend bitcoins in any real way until the grabbin's done (or at least, until it's reasonably clear who will be buying in and who won't).
Imagine 1000 acres of land pop up out of the ocean, pristine, tropical, full of natural resources.  The government is auctioning off the land, but very few people have even heard of this auction.  So you got a few acres really cheap.  Do you have any reason to doubt that *everyone* would want to buy this land if they a) heard of it and b) could afford it?  So if you already bought some cheap, why in hell would you sell before everyone has gotten wind of it?
One thing is clear, only a tiny fraction of people who would want to buy bitcoin have heard of bitcoin.   I think it's almost as clear that $45 is still extremely cheap if indeed all these people eventually get word of it.

I'm not convinced that a fatal flaw can be found. An exploit, sure.  Bitcoin is prone to bugs just like any other software. But the value of bitcoin is the integrity of the ledger.  An exploit would be handled by rolling back the ledger and continuing with an updated client.  It's not perfect, but would not kill the currency, since almost no one would be affected by the rollback.

I'd say hardware wallets solve this more than "somewhat".  
Compromising a hardware wallet is several orders of magnitude more difficult than compromising an everyday desktop or laptop computer (especially if it runs Windows).  Hardware wallets only do one thing, so there's generally no reason to legitimately alter its software, so hacks of this kind simply are not possible.  The attacker would have to resort to physically altering the hardware wallet, which as you might guess is very difficult to pull off.  You'd have to get the device, alter it, and replace it without the victim noticing.
Edit: 
Sorry, I am talking about a different class of problem than OP.  The hardware wallet solves the problem of an attacker altering a payment address on the payer's machine.  I think he's referring to payment addresses being altered at receiver's machine (in this case, some internet business's server).  The payment protocol will help with this too, it helps you verify that an address belongs to who it's supposed to belong to.

@_date: 2013-04-29 14:41:09
I really don't get the reservation that bitcoin only exists on the internet.  OK, so if the internet ceased to exist, so would your bitcoins.  However a temporary interruption of the internet would only prevent you from spending bitcoins, you wouldn't lose them.
But imagine what kind of chaos required for the internet to go away.  The only way I see to hedge against that is to physically hold gold, ammo, medicine, you know, "sky is falling" kind of position.
Owning gold but not being in physical possession of it, is no better than bitcoins.
And having physical possession of large amounts of gold is problematic because most people have no way of securing it.  With bitcoins you do have a way of protecting it.
Here's what would I do.  I'd have a cold wallet, with the key split into 4 parts using Shamir's Scheme.  2 of the 4 parts are required to spend the funds.  So I have 1 part in a safe at home, 1 part hidden on my property, 1 part with a family member, and 1 part in a safe deposit box at the local bank.
A burglar cannot steal my bitcoins.  A house fire cannot harm my bitcoins.  A corrupt bank employee cannot steal my bitcoins.  If I forget where I hid the share on my property I am still safe.
Try doing that with gold, it is not possible, unless you bury it in a remote area, and secure the location of it with the same scheme.

The better question is why would anyone bother?  If someone pays you in cash you wouldn't go looking up serial numbers to find out if it's ever been held by criminals.  That isn't your problem. 
There is no debating whether or not this is bad for a currency, it is.  The question is whether this would simply be a govcoin/bitcoin split where bitcoin would carry on as before.  Given that they share the blockchain, it doesn't look good. 
However, it seems like such a stupid idea that I don't think anyone will do it.  
Edit: I don't even see how government could mandate this.  Everyone knows that doing this with dollars is a terrible idea, isn't it obvious that the only reason to do this is to destroy the currency?

Huh?  I was under the impression that 51% of the hashing power at any given point in time, takes over the end of the chain, regardless of how long it is.  The attacker would have control for as long as they maintain 51%.
@_date: 2013-08-27 20:05:33


Correct, but it would take a collusion of 51% the miners to prevent your transaction from being confirmed.  Whatever miner finds the block decides what transactions get in, but there's no way to know which minerwill find it.  If whoever finds it doesn't like your transaction, maybe the miner of the next block will. (edit: 51% of the hashing power - theoretically that could be one miner.  That's called a 51% attack though, which is getting very expensive to mount).


No it isn't- not for the long term. And even it it were, it wouldn't matter. The only way to avoid proliferation of specialized mining hardware is to make the hashing algorithm such that CPUs are about as good as you can get.  That's what Litecoin went for (scrypt algorithm).

Sorry but you are wrong.  Without seeing the private key, you have no way to know if the address shown is the one that belongs to the private key.  And even if you see the private key, there's no way to be sure someone else doesn't have it.  The only way to be sure you're going to get the funds on that paper wallet is to actually take them - by sweeping the funds to your own address in a transaction.
The only way you should ever accept physical bitcoins (meaning, someone gives you a coin or bill or paper wallet - anything with the private key on it), is if you trust the person who made it and that the seal on the coin was actually put there by them.

I bought btc from bitinstant twice.  Both times the transaction "failed" even though the money was withdrawn from my Dwolla account.

Their support staff seems overworked or underskilled, or both.
I use coinbase now, they seem more reliable, you don't need to involve Dwolla, and the fees are lower.  It takes 4 days to get the coins, but the price is fixed when you order, so unless you're planning to spend them right away, it's fine.

An important point is that clients are designed to go with the first transaction they see.  So if a double spend attempt is more than x seconds behind, it is not going to be honored.
The exact value of x you should use depends on who your bitcoin client is peered with.  If you trust your peers not to be involved in a double spend, then x could be very small, 10 seconds or less.

This prediction is more or less accurate.  Wifi is only for the last 50 feet, the rest of the internet pipe is still a wire.
People could actually use a 4G card to connect their computers to the internet, but they don't.  Why?

Since each block must contain the hash of one previous block, and the proof of work also encompasses the previous block hash, a miner can't use the same work on more than one block.
However miners can work two chains simultaneously. They just have to split up their hash power if they wish to do so.

You vastly overestimate how much billions of people care to examine how their money works. They do not give a shit until it's too late. And even then, they basically act as if they can't do anything about it, and make the exact same mistake again. This has repeated throughout history, it's human nature and basically immutable.
What bitcoin offers is definitely not a game changer for most people, because they're too stupid to see through the trickery that banks will offer them. It only offers choice to those shrewd enough - a small minority of the population. It's still important, don't get me wrong. But remember: "you can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink."

This is repeated ad nauseam and it's probably wrong.  If bitcoin were just another fiat currency, yes, there would be no reason to go back to it.  But it has properties that are currently unmatched, there's no real competition.  It can falter and recover - it already has, several times.  


Well, that's what we aim to find out.  When you're talking about human behavior, there's a lot of variables at play.  "Reality has time-and-again demonstrated that man cannot fly" was a truism for all of history, until it wasn't.
I admit I have my doubts here too.  In a bitcoin dominated world, the only investment you would rationally want to make is one you believe will appreciate faster than bitcoin.  There's a lot that won't make it over that bar.  Is that really a problem? Will bitcoin even become dominant anyway?  Does it need to?  I don't know.  Seems worth finding out.
Regardless, the result of this experiment in deflationary currency won't be known for a long time.  It's not going to crash tomorrow or next year or this decade due to a deflationary spiral.

I very much doubt this.  
Corporations exist to make money.  They are not in the business of giving away money just because it once passed through criminal hands.  If the law doesn't force them to do this, they won't do it.  With dollars they are not forced to.  Even if there was a database of serial numbers used in crimes, they **still** wouldn't do it.

Let's say Joe makes $50k per year.  He bought 100btc last year for $1000.  Now worth $80k.
That's over 1 years salary.  Even though he knows the value will increase further, he will start to think of all the great things he could do with that money. At some point, having it today wins over having more tomorrow.  When it's a lot of money (to you) already, the balance starts to tip toward cashing out.

First of all, not only miners determine the rules of the network.  All the nodes do.  You don't have to mine, just run a full client.  They all forward transactions and blocks, and reject invalid ones.
Also, there are other problems with cpu mining other than blindly accepting updates - botnets.  Most of the mining proceeds would go to whoever could compromise the most windows machines.

Click the "Signed version history" link.
In there is a SHA1 sum for the page.  Download the page (save as html only), and at the command line run
$ sha1sum bitaddress.org.html
Then compare the two.  They should match.
For further verification, you could get bitaddress.org's pgp key, and verify the signature on the version history file.  The link to their pgp public key is on that page too.
However all this hinges on verifying the bitaddress.org guy actually owns that key.
After all, if the bitaddress.org site was compromised, the attacker could just point to his own key, sign a fake message with a hash of the hacked page.
I am not quite sure how to verify that but it's a good question.  I will submit an issue to the guy and ask if he has had his key signed by anyone else in the bitcoin community that people are likely to trust.

If you loan bitcoins, the borrower has to be doing something with them that creates more value than just holding the bitcoins.  If bitcoin is increasing in value at 30% (or even 20% or 10%) a year, that will wipe out nearly every type of investment that exists today.  
The only question is whether there would be some other avenue for these businesses to exist.  They won't be funded by a bitcoin loan, for sure.

Of course the app *has* to store your password in plain text, unless you want to be prompted for it just to open your wallet.  That is impractical on a mobile device so the app devs made the correct decision.
Do you want to protect your wallet such that anyone who has your phone can open the app, but they can't steal the money?  Turns out blockchain.info already has that feature.  It's called the 2nd password.  
Now, if your android device is rooted and full of malware, all bets are off.  But that is the case with any online wallet.  If you cannot trust the OS it runs on, then your money is not safe.
Edit:  by "online" I mean hot wallet, anything stored on a computer.  I am not only referring to wallet services like blockchain.info, I include bitcoin-qt, Armory, Multibit, Electrum, etc.  If your OS is not secure, then neither are your bitcoins.

Sorry to hear about your friend.
If he was a savvy bitcoin user, and he didn't make any provisions for someone else to have access to them in case something happened to him, then you will probably never recover them.
However maybe he left the keys relatively accessible - did he leave any passwords at all?  It's possible he was careless and only left the OS password with his bitcoin wallet in the clear.  That should be easy to crack.  
More likely though, if he didn't leave you any passwords the bitcoins are not recoverable.
@_date: 2013-07-18 16:39:13
Laws are not going to destroy bitcoin's value.  The black market alone is more than big enough to support it at a higher value than today.
Paradoxically, what holds bitcoin's value down is volatility.  A stable price causes it to destabilize, and vice versa.  The big question is where is the equilibrium (or maybe bitcoin is doomed to instability forever)? 
My guess is the price graph from 2009 until now is what bitcoin prices will look like for a long time.  A period of stability followed by a dramatic rise, then instability, and then stabilizing again at a higher price than the last stable price.  It may reach a final stable level once we're "all in" (when bitcoin has reached everywhere it's going to reach).

Is it?  Bitcoin's deflationary nature encourages people to take bigger risks.  The amount of bitcoins it takes before it's really stupid to store them on a spyware laden windows xp install, is surprisingly small.  One is too many, unless you have more money than sense.
Putting bitcoins on your unhardened windows computer is like leaving cash on your front doorstep.  It might be fine for a while, because no dishonest people notice it, but eventually it'll be gone.  It doesn't matter if it's one dollar or a million.  
Granted, just the learning experience of bitcoin is worth something, so experimenting with a small amount is ok even if it gets stolen.  But at some point the learning is over and people want to actually use it.  But they can't.


But that is not done by taking advantage of individuals' lack of computer security knowledge.
@_date: 2013-04-02 02:25:19
So the question you should be asking yourself before buying is, will bitcoin continue to be adopted or not?  Don't just guess.
There are lots of variables here.  Does it have killer features?  Will it be easy to use?  Will it scale?  Will the government try to stop it?  Can they stop it?   If you don't pick up some pretty in-depth knowledge on these questions, you might as well just be gambling.
I read probably hundreds of posts just about the max block size limit (a scalability issue) because I though that could be a major hurdle for bitcoin.  Just to satisfy myself that I understood the issue well enough to bet on it.

People are just now starting to hear about it.  It could be a while before they decide whether they want to actually buy any.

I've actually been helping out with this, there's some good discussion on some of the issues on github.
Nothing being discussed is anything you should really worry about, except maybe one thing.  If when bitaddress starts and asks you to move the mouse to generate entropy, AND YOU DIDN'T MOVE IT, I am not convinced it has enough entropy to be safe from very powerful brute force attacks, and it will only get worse as computers get faster.  It might still be safe, might not.  If you didn't move the mouse and you're paranoid, generate a new key (load the page again and move the mouse this time). 
That's not to say that there can't be vulnerabilities that the community has overlooked.  The more eyeballs we have on the code, the better.  So help out!  All you need is a browser to play around with the internals and verify the security for yourself.

This is very dangerous.  Yes, you can potentially increase your bitcoin holdings.  But eventually you will be wrong and sell right before a 10x rally and that will be that.
For many bitcoin holders, the potential profits are so enormous that risking them for twice as much profit is crazy.  
As an extreme example let's say you make $50k per year and have 1000 btc.  If it goes to $10,000 you'll have ten million.  That's so much money for someone who makes $50k, that risking it for the chance at 20 million makes no sense at all.

Sorry but that's bullshit.
While it's true that every OS has security vulnerabilities, there's a huge difference in how they are handled.  Apple and MS's first reaction is to worry about their profits and shareholders - if there's a good chance that ignoring (or worse, burying) the problem won't result in huge losses, that's exactly what they will do.  And you can see that in their products.  They don't push security because it's a waste of money.  Their user base is now so accustomed to being hacked they think it's inevitable.  Why tell them otherwise?
The open source communities usually care about their users.  Not that they're particularly altruistic, but the people in control are usually themselves users of the software, and by serving themselves they serve everyone else.

You have to give up something here - you either set the face value in bitcoins, in which case the machine has to be able to dispense change (because the conversion rate changes).

I don't think this weakness of bitcoin is as bad as it seems.  A brute force or 51% attack double spend would be detected, so in order for it to be worthwhile, it would have to be a pretty big purchase.
So when accepting large payments from large miners, just wait for more confirmations.  For example, if you wait for 15 blocks, the probability of success in a month is 0.03%.
Is it so bad that if you are a merchant, you would ask a large miner to wait 2 1/2 hours to receive his large purchase?  Even if you take anonymous payments (so anyone could be a large miner), making everyone wait that long doesn't seem so bad.

That would be nice to have verifiable hardware. But let's face it, nobody is watching Intel either. 
I'm not saying the hardware has to be custom.  It just has to run software that isn'tc easily modifiable at runtime.  You can do that with commodity chips. 
Edit: I mean, the chips don't have to be custom, that's really the only part you can't examine after manufacture if I understand correctly.

In order to peg them at $100 each one would have to be redeemable for $100.  Who the author intends to do that redeeming, I have no clue.
Whatever his intent, what he's describing is not bitcoin at all.  If he wants a cryptocurrency pegged to the dollar, he can create one.  In fact, bitcoin is open source if he just wants to use that as a starting point and modify it.

This seems like a common misunderstanding around here.  Infinite divisibility does NOT mean moving the decimal place.
See what I did there?  It's not moving the decimal place, it's just allowing for smaller amounts.  
Granted you could change the unit of measure from bitcoins to millibitcoins.  But that does not increase supply.  Just like if you have a  gram of gold, and you then say you have 1000 milligrams of gold, nothing has changed.  The amount of gold you have is exactly the same.

Yes, for people who really want someone *else* to control their money, there will be banks.  The whole point of bitcoin is to take control away from the central authority and give it to you.  If you don't want it, that's a whole other matter.  Lots of people do.  Bitcoin will prove that normal people can handle this themselves, with a little technological help.  20 years ago average joes couldn't publish their own periodical worldwide, now anyone can.
As for spending money on the high street, that's just a matter of time.  Soon you will have a small hardware wallet with a little keypad for your PIN.  The amount you owe and store's payment address will be sent to it (say over NFC), you'll enter your PIN, and the signed transaction will go back to the store (again, say over NFC) to be sent over the bitcoin network for confirmation.  For everyday transactions, the store only needs to wait around 10 seconds to avoid double-spends.  The reason most people won't be using their phones for this is that phones can be easily hacked and your keys stolen.  However your phone *can* be used to transmit payments and show you your balance.  The hardware wallet just signs transactions and is more tamper-proof.
People might think they want fraud protection, but it's not worth it.  First of all, you pay for banks' shitty security - every time they take a loss, you pay a share of it.  And worst of all, banks often have no way to tell who is lying, so someone can claim fraud against you, and you end up losing big.

For what? 
(IANAC warning applies)
Depending on where it's used, it may not matter.  Producing a collision when you can't inject that collision anywhere (which would probably be the case since you can run bitaddress offline), wouldn't help an attacker.
However if he could produce a collision for any value, that would be a serious problem.  I don't think that is anywhere close to happening for SHA-1 though.
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:28:40
Ah I see.  Knowing whether you can trust the bitaddress code you're running is a whole can of worms.  
I am pretty confident that **if** an attacker were to fool you into running his backdoored version of bitaddress, a SHA-1 collision would NOT be how he pulled it off.  A million times more likely, he would just hack both the posted code and the posted hash at the same time. 
Ideally you would download pointbiz's public key, wait a while (long enough for him to detect if his hosted code was altered and alert users), then validate bitaddress's signature with his key.
Getting his public key (or hash) and the code at the same time is not particularly useful validation, since they can both be replaced by an attacker. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 03:13:07
Yes, of course it can.  Some entity  can just issue notes backed by bitcoins, and then just issue more notes than they actually have bitcoins to back it.

Fractions of a bit are a real thing in information theory, or at least as real as a bit itself.  
From 
"As another example, the entropy rate of English text is between 1.0 and 1.5 bits per letter,[6] or as low as 0.6 to 1.3 bits per letter, according to estimates by Shannon based on experiments where humans were asked to predict the next letter in a sample of English text."
So you might say something like "there are 7.247 bits of entropy in the text 'foo'."

That seems pretty unlikely to me.  When the dollars show up in your mtgox account, they're in Japan and, as far as I know, outside US jurisdiction.
It doesn't really matter what blocks authorities put on fiat entering or leaving the exchange, there's always the bitcoin escape hatch.  In other words, spend all your dollars on bitcoins, withdraw the bitcoins, and sell them somewhere where you can still get the dollars back.

Not true anymore. Ubuntu for example is just as easy to install and use as Windows. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 21:12:50
Not just quicker, but cheaper.
The only way to mine bitcoins nowadays is with equipment that will quite possibly cost more than it will ever mine in bitcoins over its lifetime.
In other words, mining is not for newbs unless you don't mind losing money.  
Depending on where you (OP) are in the world, there are various ways of buying.  However don't expect it to be instant.  You cannot buy bitcoins with CC or paypal.  The reason is, bitcoin payments are irreversible while CC payments are easily reversible.  So what would happen is the scammer takes the bitcoin and then reverses his payment, keeping both.  
Coinbase (USA) is pretty convenient.

I don't mean escape the system as in "drop out of society".  I don't hate banks or government in general.  I just don't want to pay hidden taxes and useless fees.  I'm just going to stop doing that.  Heck, if my bank started issuing hardware bitcoin wallets and encrypted key storage, and trustless transactions I'd be thrilled and would be happy to do business with them.  I don't see why other people wouldn't be enthusiastic about that too, if they understood it and there were no serious downsides (which currently there are, but probably not for long).
Replenishing funds:  It works the same way.  All you need is a way to sign the transfer such that no one can spy on your private key.  There are various ways, none of them are dead simple currently but it's a solvable problem.

I think it's a bubble too, since bitcoin proved it could survive one bubble popping, confidence is up, and the land-grab will be even more pronounced.
I suspect the increasing price will increase media attention again, suckering in more speculators who hadn't heard about bitcoin last time.  Price shoots above $50 or maybe even $100 before old-timers start dumping their coins. I'm guessing the equilibrium is more like $10.

Create two transactions, one sending to a 1 of 2 signatures address, the other with a future time lock that sweeps the address back to your wallet. Something like that.

Pretty simple isn't it?  The "highest possible difficulty" is a hash of zero (all zeros).  The odds of any hash being zero is 1 in 2^256.  However many hashes per second that would be, I'm sure it's not even close to feasible.

I'm not talking about changing shamir's algorithm.  I'm just talking about reducing the number of times you convert a number to a string and back.
A bitcoin private key is a *number*.  You can represent it in hex or binary or base58 or whatever.  But as soon as you take the base58 representation of a key and put it in passguardian, it's not treated as a base58 number anymore.  It's treated as a string, and re-converted to a number (a different number than the original key).  Then it's split and output in hex string.  Then to convert that to base58, it may be YET AGAIN treated as a string and not a number.
I'm just saying skip all that crap, just do it in one step.  Treat it as a number the whole way through, and base58 it at the end.

Absolutely not.  You need to understand the difference between "hard for a person to guess", and "hard for a powerful computer to brute force".
Do you know how long it takes a computer to guess every possible birthday of anyone ages 2 to 100?  Less than a millisecond.
What you're talking about here is "security by obscurity".  You're hoping an attacker won't know how you chose your easy to remember passphrase.  But if he is able to determine this (usually by trying lots of common methods by brute force), you're hosed.
The only way to be sure that an attacker can't exploit the method you used to make your passphrase is to use a truly random one.

I disagree.  When I install software on my Fedora linux machine, it always comes from the Fedora repository.  So there is virtually no chance that any of it will contain malware, since it is all open source.  So there is one attack vector that does not exist.  I cannot be tricked into installing malware as long as I stick with the official repos, which contain pretty much everything I need.
Of course, bitcoin-qt is not in the repo, but I can still verify its hash or build it myself.
Then there are vulnerabilities like buffer overflow.  selinux does a pretty good job against those.  As far as I know, windows has no analogous defense.  
Then there are things like network based zero day attacks against network facing ports, but very few are not behind a router or firewall anymore.
And then of course there are attacks against the user himself, like phishing.  In those cases obviously the OS doesn't matter.

For god's sake!  There's no nuance here at all.  The answer is Yes.  Yes you are supposed to pay taxes.  It doesn't matter whether your gain is stored as dollars, bitcoins, rat hair, sand, helium, whatever.  The government wants a cut (in dollars) of all your gains.  Whether they will ever find out about it is a totally separate question.  If you are asking if you are *supposed* to pay, the answer is yes.
Edit: Sorry, I mean when you exchange whatever it is for dollars again.  If you never do, then no, no taxes.  Just like if you buy a house for $100k and the value goes up to $1 million, you don't owe any extra tax unless you sell.
Edit: in the house example your property tax will go up, but I'm talking income taxes here.

Yes, but that is a hollow statement, like saying all that matters is supply and demand.  But so what?  The question is, will finding out that more coins are lost than previously thought, affect supply and demand, and then in turn affect price?  The answer is most certainly yes.

I think your characterization of the Silk Road seizure as "stealing" is laughable.  Why would they bother?  Do you know what 100 million dollars is the to the federal government?

5 or 10 percent discounts are useless.  Either bitcoin will take off or it won't. 
If it will, then you should be offering 50% discounts, because as it takes off the value will increase to make up for your losses (most likely, you will end up profiting greatly by accepting bitcoins early, if bitcoin takes off, even with an 80% discount).
If bitcoin isn't going to take off, you shouldn't bother accepting bitcoins at all.

I keep 3 figures worth of bitcoin in blockchain.info's online wallet.  I have the 2nd password enabled.  I am interested to know if people think this isn't secure enough.  
As far as I can tell there are 3 major attack vectors here
1) Compromise of the javascript on blockchain's site that is modified to capture the unlocked private key.  To steal my coins, blockchain would have to be totally pwned and I'd have to open my wallet and send coins before the hack is detected.  Seems very unlikely.
2) Compromise of my local computer or phone to capture my passwords as I unlock the private key - this is a potential problem with any wallet except cold storage, I'm ok with my level of security here.
3) Compromise of my password storage service (won't say which) that has my passwords in it.  My second password for blockchain isn't stored there, just a mnemonic.
Am I missing anything? 
The reason I haven't done the cold wallet is I believe I am more likely to lose my keys (or have a difficult time retrieving them) than to have my blockchain.info wallet hacked.

Any device that accepts incoming data from the internet, and allows users to install new apps (thus changing its behavior), is just not suitable for securing secrets.  A smartphone or laptop/desktop just don't work well.  There is a post here almost every day of people getting their bitcoins stolen and it's because their smartphone/desktop/laptop has been compromised.
A hardware wallet does one thing.  It protects your private key and signs transactions.  It should never need updates or new apps, it doesn't take any other input except transactions to sign.  It would be impossible to hack remotely, and could be very difficult to hack even if you're in physical possession of it.

Bitcoin was here first and has a strong lead in both mindshare and economic activity.  In order for another currency to have any chance of catching bitcoin, it has to be superior in some meaningful way.
None of the existing altcoins are superior in any meaningful way.  They are doomed.  The only reason litecoin is trading at the level is does today is pure speculation that some greater fool will come along and believe that altcoins will continue to be adopted.

Yes, the hacker would have to gain remote access and replace pages being served to the users.
Given how big the payout to the hacker might be (every single user that accesses the compromised site would lose all the bitcoins in their wallet, until the hack is detected, and a clever hacker would just show a full wallet to the user even though it is empty).
Gaining remote access isn't that impossible.  All it takes is an unpatched exploit in a service that blockchain's server is running.  But yes, getting the exploit and the rootkitted code in place without being detected immediately is pretty difficult. 
I wouldn't say "close to impossible" though.  Given that blockchain is open source, the hacker would be able to test out his rootkit pretty easily before trying the real attack, so he could take his sweet time developing it.  Then again, if an exploit never presented itself, he'd be wasting his time, so maybe no one would bother.

Edit:  if this DDoS attack is bitcoin related, it is probably the last of its kind, at least for a while.  Seems like a sign that the attackers are getting more and more desperate to try to cause a crash.  DDoS on mtgox no longer seems to affect the price, so they tried DDoSing miners.  Didn't work.

Sorry but I totally disagree.  You are confusing two different things.
1) Converting between fiat and bitcoin.  This is difficult and only getting MORE difficult.  This is partially because of regulation and partially because of mismatch of reversibility.  For bitcoin to succeed it has to start being traded for things other than fiat.
2) Exchange rate.  if/when bitcoins increase in value, nobody wants to deal with tiny fractions of anything.  0.0003 btc for a stamp is an unacceptable representation, but 300 uBTC is ok.

That's not going to happen without some breakthroughs in crypto.  You can't let an untrusted machine do computation for your app.  You'd have no way to verify if their computation was correct.

An analysis of the blockchain shows the majority of bitcoins don't circulate, and in fact a large number of bitcoins were moved around to various addresses in what appears to be an attempt to obfuscate their origin.
As the price of bitcoin rises I guess we'll see if these large caches start getting sold to the open market.

I used NICKEL SILVER (Melting Point 2030°F).  It will survive most house fires, aluminum won't.
You can buy small pieces of sheet metal with this material online, for just a few dollars. 
I sprung for the metal stamps to do base58 (upper and lowercase alphabet, 0-9).  The stamps cost $50 total, but it takes way less time to write a key onto the metal in base58 than base 2 or base 16.  You have to bang the hammer about 40 times for base58.

Hm.  I can't figure out how not reopening helps at all.
If the hackers have hashes of secrets, it doesn't really help them unless they brute force the hash.  So reopening doesn't hurt as long as  users quickly change their secret.
If the hackers have the secrets themselves, then it's just a race between the hackers and users to move the funds.
Or are you saying instawallet already moved all the funds and is now trying to figure out who owns what?  Hopefully the users still have *some* identifying info that wasn't compromised by the hack.

I doubt people will agree to the current market rate, it would probably have to be a significant discount to allow for appreciation.
The two parties would have to arrive at some mutually agreed upon guess as to what the appreciation will be.  And then it's still risky for either party, if the appreciation is much higher or lower than expected.
So it's quite likely one party will get screwed and the other will gain.  (edited for logic)

I think the cons are orphaned blocks. I am not sure of all the details, but I think this is the gist of it:  You mine a block that meets the difficulty criteria but someone else mined a slightly more difficult one first, but it hasn't propagated to you yet. So your work is wasted and the network wastes resources passing around your orphaned block.
I think what you are really asking is, why do we have to wait 10 minutes to accept bitcoins.  The answer is that we don't.
@_date: 2013-05-20 20:31:31
Imagine ASICMiner having 100% of the hashing power.  Then they could manufacture new blades all day long, and what would those blades be worth to ASICMiner?  Nothing.  They would be worthless, because mining with them would earn them not a single extra dime.  But they could sell them, because it's worth money to others.
This same effect holds true at &lt;100%.  
Edit:  what's important here is whether someone else is willing to pay ASICMiner more for the blades than they feel they can earn by mining with them.  Personally I think there are a lot of suckers out there willing to pay almost anything for ASICs.  That's why I bought shares in ASICMiner instead of an ASIC.

Um, well, I can't speak for how it actually works since I've never used it.
However the way you describe it, it sounds like it is not possible for a buyer to even leave a bad review.  I find that difficult to believe.
But I could believe it is easy to get fake feedback by just selling bitcoins to a shill account.  For $50 you can have $5000 worth of positive feedback, and that should enable you to scam much more than $50.

In this sense I think what we're seeing today is exactly the same as the 2011 bubble, except the circle is getting much wider now (which makes sense because the infrastructure is better).
One area where the infrastructure hasn't changed at all is buying bitcoins, we're stuck with shitty fiat infrastructure where nothing happens fast enough to keep up with the bitcoin market.  That's just another positive story for bitcoin, if you choose to see it that way.  The downside is that sending dollars to the exchange will never be nearly as easy as sending bitcoins from the exchange to your wallet.

You'll either do a cash deposit or cash by mail.  That's actually *easier* than a lot of legitimate exchanges today.

I hope bitcoin ATMs take off, but who knows.  I'm not sure how they work - if I own a bitcoin ATM, what is my relationship with the store owner whose store I put it in?
I can't sell it to him because he has no way to refill it with bitcoins he bought himself.  I would have to own it and occasionally go to the store to empty the dollars out, replenish it with bitcoins, and pay the owner a percentage.  Doesn't seem very scalable, but maybe I'm missing something.

People can use a computer because there's no money on it to steal.  The best a hacker can do is convince the user, through whatever computer trickery, to give them money.  Bitcoins are different, the hacker can just plain steal them.
Bitcoins have no insurance.  The phrase "be your own bank" is of particular importance here.  Most people don't *want* to be their own bank, because they cannot handle the security aspect.  Let's not try to convince them that they do, because they don't.  Pocket change, fine.  Life savings, no.

I always wondered how this worked.  When economies expand not in size, but in quality, how can you compare it to what you had before?
For example, let's say the country's population is stable, and now everyone rides around on horses and horses cost $1000.  Now the automobile is invented.  After a while everyone rides around in cars and cars cost $1000.  But that would seem to mean that cars and horses are of equal value, and they are not, clearly, since everyone voted for cars. 
Edit: i know that after everyone has a car, horses may change in price, but the price may actually go *up* because not everyone needs one anymore so there is no economy of scale. There's no way to directly compare to arrive at how much extra value the invention of the car actually added to the economy.  Or is there?

It's looking almost certain that the block size will not stay 1mb forever.
Considering that transactions take up on the order of hundreds of bytes, a home cablemodem connection can take in 10,000 transactions per second.  
Now, I doubt that a regular home computers have the CPU horsepower validate that many per second, but I don't think it would take a supercomputer either.  And every year home computers will increase in speed faster than the transaction rate (assuming we're starting from the day it's already at 10k per second, that means bitcoin has already gotten bigger than VISA).  And validating transactions should be highly parallelizable, so more cores will help.  Frankly, if bitcoin becomes bigger than VISA, I think that is an astounding victory.  If the downside is only that running a full node would require machines that cost, say, 10x that of a typical desktop, I think that's still quite acceptable to most current bitcoin users.  
@_date: 2013-04-03 12:54:11
In a way, the article is right.  A lot of people trading bitcoin don't care about the fundamentals.   Even though the fundamentals say bitcoin will eventually be worth more than they are now, that doesn't really matter.  I don't think the masses care about that, and so the bubble will still inflate and pop the same way as with beanie babies.
Edit:  the $64k question, of course, is where will the top and bottom be :)
@_date: 2013-05-14 18:18:01
That's the common misconception, that bitcoin is convenient.  It really isn't, yet.  
There's a couple major pieces of infrastructure missing:
* decentralized exchange
* hardware wallet
* Point of sale communication hardware, protocol
That being said it is still not that hard to store bitcoins safely.  It's just that you have to trade convenience for safety.  You don't have to be particularly savvy to boot a live OS image, leave it off the network, print a paper wallet.
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:52:54

A 1tb harddrive costs $70 and a 30 mbit cablemodem connection costs $70 per month.  Both of which are hundreds of times more than what is needed to run a full node currently.
Given that pruning algorithms are coming and it's not clear what the block size limit will be in the future, I don't think it's at all clear when (if ever) the network will outstrip ordinary hardware.  
I think if bitcoin is adopted VERY quickly, it might happen.  However, I think eventually hardware would catch up again.  If the whole world is already using bitcoin, the number of transactions per second is not going to increase much after that - not compared to how fast hardware capacity increases, anyway.

I am not an expert cryptographer, so someone can correct me if I'm wrong here, but I've done some research.
What's much better than a brain wallet is to use Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme.
The whole reason for using a brain wallet is that if you write down the password there is a risk of it being lost or stolen.  SSSS is a much more effective way of preventing that.  
I even added this feature to bitaddress.org, if you want to see how it works:  
See the "Split Wallet" tab.  NOTE!  absolutely do not trust this page to generate a real wallet.  You don't know me from Adam.  It's just a demonstration.  
In fact that is an honest implementation if you want to examine it.  However, not being an expert in cryptography, I can't be sure it doesn't have accidental weaknesses.  It uses the secrets.js lib to split the key, so none of the crypto routines were written by me.

Oh I'd bet the farm BTC were indeed seized.
The Silk Road website was completely compromised because the FBI got to the hosting provider. Once the attacker has access to the hardware, it's game over.  They got a complete copy of the server which would have to include hot wallets.  DPR didn't manually unlock bitcoins for every Silk Road transaction, the server itself had the keys.
Edit:  but given that more than 1 person had the keys (DPR, FBI and possibly other SR employees), you'd expect to see the FBI move the coins before the employees did).  It should be on the blockchain if someone can figure out where.  If it's not there you may be right that the FBI doesn't really have them.  But yeah, they *should*.

A bank employee could steal your coins and there is nothing you could do about it. You could not even prove that's how they were stolen.
Edit: at least use a tamper proof envelope.
@_date: 2013-12-16 12:44:24
Yes, that's part of what defines an encryption algorithm. Its output should be indistinguishable from random. So all encrypted data are indistinguishable from each other.
In practice though, communication has metadata that is not encrypted that can help identify the type of traffic.
It's basically true though that the government would have to block all encrypted communication.

They who? An average user has to trust someone, presumably the author of bitaddress.  Signatures don't help if the author isn't trustworthy. 
There is no way for anyone to verify his public key unless they can communicate with him on a side channel, which they can't. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 01:21:41
Yeah OP doesn't get it. The whole point of BIP38 is that you can use a password that you'll remember, and here he goes making passwords you have to write down or put a lot of effort into memorizing.

Huh?  So you're saying even if the whole world didn't care about gold at all, one guy might still care?  How is that not the case also for dollars or bitcoins?  If no one wanted gold then it would no longer be useful for electronics or jewerly, so what is the one guy using it for?  Nothing, unless he invented a new use for it.  Or maybe he expects people to change their minds.  Same holds for dollars or bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-07-16 12:06:25
I wasn't talking about Ripple, I was talking about "Create a Bitcoin-like currency designed to be easy to regulate."
The whole point of bitcoin is that it isn't government regulated.  Yes, it's also an easy to use payment system.  If the government created a cheap electronic payment system to compete with bitcoin, that would be a huge win.
If they created a currency that they themselves could not inflate on a whim, then bitcoin has won.  If they create a currency that they *can* inflate on a whim, then it isn't bitcoin-like at all.
@_date: 2013-08-14 02:45:15
This article makes relatively good points.   I think he pigeonholes bitcoin as just currency when it is intended to be more than that. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 12:00:25
Right, just like the internet isn't the enemy of the recording and movie industries. Oh wait, it still is, over a decade later.
Just because banks can offer bitcoin services, doesn't mean they'll be anywhere near as profitable as what they have now. So if they can block bitcoin's progress, they will. And there is plenty they can do (already doing) to make the interface between fiat and bitcoin as difficult as possible.
@_date: 2013-08-06 21:35:18
I suppose it may play out that way, but it doesn't concern me too much.
It would end up just causing a govcoin/bitcoin fork and things would go on just as before (except maybe govcoin would be superior to dollars in some way).
@_date: 2013-12-20 23:15:09
No it is already too late.  
The currency you describe would just make an easy bridge to bitcoin, as soon as the issuer started abusing its power (either by inflating the money supply or blacklisting coins or spying).
@_date: 2013-12-21 01:55:02
If something better comes along, it might be that. 
But all the other cryptocurrencies right now are clones with nothing significant extra to offer.  So bitcoin just has a head start, and no one is even catching up, yet.

So try it.  I was actually looking at bitaddress's random number generator today, since any problem there could be fatal.  But I didn't see any glaring problems with how it is seeded. It should never produce the same key twice. 
2^160 is too big to exhaustively search, no matter how big a computer you have. 
@_date: 2013-02-20 19:46:41
Where should one keep a paper wallet?  Not at home (at least, not the only copy) - if there's a fire your bitcoins are lost forever.  I suppose there are fire-proof safes but they aren't cheap.

Sigh.  That article is totally irrelevant.
If the thief had spent the stolen coins, then yes it is theoretically possible to analyze the chain and do some investigation to trace back the coins to the thief.  Practically, though, it is never going to happen.
And most importantly, the thief hasn't spent the coins yet!  So no analysis can be done, which is why I said the thief is perfectly safe right now, and he does not need to move the coins.
@_date: 2013-11-13 15:48:38
Yeah, I think you are right.  Assuming the bug is a "steal coins" kind of bug, the "fuck it" fork would probably win outright.  Very few people would take a loss by choosing that fork.  I say that because, if they'd been screwed by the bug, they'd have noticed it at the time it happened.  If they didn't notice, they probably wouldn't notice at fork time either.

The bitcoin landscape changes so fast and there's no definitive instructions.  So someone told you to buy $100 of bitcoins from Mt Gox, and transfer it to the bitcoin-qt wallet, and you did.  That advice was horrible, but it isn't your fault.
I agree with this warning - if you don't know what you're doing (or at least you are prepared to face the consequences of not knowing what you're doing), stay the hell away from bitcoin.  Give it a couple more years.
edit: you didn't actually say someone told you to do any of this.  Did you even ask anyone?
@_date: 2013-11-11 22:42:39
Yes you can buy fractions of a bitcoin **anywhere** they are sold.   In fact, you can buy really as little as you want.

I am not convinced centralized exchanges are necessary, take toratm for example.  
I think bitcoin will stay underground for many years, it's going to be a long war. The war on pot, for example, started 80 years ago and it's just now starting to be decriminalized.  Note the government didn't actually stop anyone from smoking pot.  Same will go for bitcoin, you'll be able to use it but only for illegal businesses.  The beauty is, this will just cause an explosion of illegal businesses that would otherwise be legit, but they go underground and don't have to pay taxes.  Guess who this will drive a wedge between? Banks and the federal government. The  government needs its revenue even if it means legalizing bitcoin and devastating the banking industry.

Nothing, but it probably wouldn't do them much good for the money it would cost.  Once they gained the majority of the hashing power, then what?  Anything nefarious would just cause a hard fork where all the honest folks leave and run bitcoin nodes that consider the government's chain invalid.  I suppose some people might stick with the govt's chain, but it would then become two separate currencies, and there may be a fight over the name 'bitcoin' but I doubt the government would win that.

That happened to me in 2011.  Would have thought they'd have fixed this by now.  FWIW they never responded to my support request.

@_date: 2013-04-10 03:50:54
No, bitcoin network itself has little to do with it, really, it's the nature of cryptocurrency, and the infrastructure built on top of it that is still pretty weak.  There's currently no straightforward way to securely store your coins.  Every guide you can find on the subject is complex, requiring understanding of cryptography and computer security.   That will eventually change, with well-known trusted 3rd parties, hardware wallets, etc.

This is such an unbelievable security fail, I don't even... If this is the type of engineering we can expect from ripple, I think it will be very short lived.
I know what ripple engineers will say, "but the unlocking is done in your browser, just like blockchain.info".  So what!  You never ever show the user their password, that just allows an attacker to compromise the account without the user being aware of it.
Edit:  in case I wasn't clear, I think OP is wrong about Ripple storing your password in plain text, that is not necessarily true.  It may never leave your browser in plain text, but it should not be in your browser either.

If there is one thing I feel like I've learned about investing, it's to stick with your convictions.  If you think something is going to be worth much more in the future than it is today, go for it. Don't hold back.  Of course you have to consider the risks, but playing it safe isn't as profitable as it used to be.

rpietila is one of the most bullish you'll find on bitcointalk, so take some of the things he says with that in mind.
For example I think the idea that $300,000 per bitcoin is reachable by 2014 is a real stretch.   And his table above assumes an end-price of $1million per BTC, which is beyond even his own bullish estimates.  If that were to actually happen, you don't need any complex strategy, just buy a couple btc today and wait.
But overall it's a sensible strategy.  It's more of a hedge than the "all or nothing" bet of just buying now and holding.  However what about people like me, who already made a lot of money but still have more liquid assets to possibly invest?   Seems like a bad idea.  Let's say I double down - put in again the same amount of dollars I have put in so far.  I would double my risk but only increase my bitcoin holdings by 3%. 


I think this is the TL;DR.

That's the definition of friendship - mutual benefit.  Some people keep this childish image of friendship as if it must be lifelong.  It's great when that happens but it's pretty unusual.  If you look at your longest friends it's usually people who moved through basically the same stages of life at basically the same time. 
If you have a great party friend, and he gets married and has kids, he disappears from your life.  If you then get married and have kids, you can hang out again.  It has nothing to do with anyone's intentions, it's just life.

You do have to be a bit careful with 2-factor auth, esp on mtgox.  If you lose your phone or have to wipe it, you will not be able to get back into your account on your own and you will have to wait for mtgox support to manually authenticate you.  Does anyone know if you can add multiple OTP keys to say, log in, and have it accept either one?
I can't see any benefit to adding 2-factor auth for withdrawal, but NOT the security center.  If the attacker can log in, then he can simply remove the 2-factor auth requirement for withdrawal.
Also, I don't get why coinbase went with Authy instead of Google Authenticator.

Bitcoin is largely unregulated so the answer to "is it safe" depends on how safe you mean.

If not, stick with the traditional system, go to Vegas to bet on sports.
