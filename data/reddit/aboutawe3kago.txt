Well proven investments to him would be something like a shoe company. Everyone has, still, and will need shoes for a while. Basically he does not gamble. He does not do the high risk high rewards method. He just buys safe stocks and hold them for a long time. That is why he is so old when he is rich lol.

Dude 250k is a lot especially for his time. He got to be millionaire in late 30s. Most of it from working lol. He became a billionaire from stocks. The point is these old money guys openly admit they are terrible at investing in Tech industries. So why are they opening their big mouths here? Protecting their old paper money duh. Bitcoin is a threat to their investments in Banks now and their own money.

The previous years took a month to pump after Consensus.
@_date: 2018-05-11 01:50:53
Looking at previous years. End of May is way more likely to go up. Don't know who said March but that was dumb of them. It may dip really hard first though after next week when people try to sell off the summit hype. But go back up in June. Nothing is guaranteed but that is my prediction. Do not sell. Consider that money gone, you got nothing to lose if you wait until late summer/fall/winter. Those are always the peak months.
@_date: 2018-05-07 02:54:04
I think the whales were building up a momentum trap to sell off right before the SEC hearing of ICOs tomorrow. If hearing goes well it's gonna pump again really hard.

Dude. If you don't know why Bitcoin is bad for banks, you should research more. If Bitcoin becomes an actual currency that is used by the mass, why would people even open a bank account anymore? We would not need banks. Bitcoin uses blockchain ledger that does not need someone in the middle(banks). Banks will have to adjust to Bitcoin yes. They can still offer loans, yes. But you don't realize how much fees they get from random fees such as overdraft on checking account, annual fees for even having an account, transaction fees that go directly to the bank and not the community mining or staking. There is so many things I can say about how wrong you are. You have a lot to learn dude. you really sound ignorant. 
@_date: 2018-05-08 05:22:18
He also said Google and Amazon was not a good investment when they first started. He only invests in proven money such as the textile business that he got rich off of. He does not invest in new innovation. You can't take his advice on new technology or Companies.

@_date: 2018-05-08 09:47:52
Uh no? He has lost tons of money in the market dude. He just got lucky with the one big winner that overshadowed those loses. Most of his investment money didn't come until later in life. He was getting paid a lot from his regular job already. That is the one thing that allowed him to keep his money long term in the investments. That is the biggest difference between him and other people. When you have big money, it's easy to hold.

@_date: 2018-05-02 04:58:37
If you are only into crypto to earn Fiat then yes. If you are really into crypto technology then no. Robinhood does not actually give you real Bitcoins. They hold the bitcoins and will offer you fiat back when you want to "sell".
Pros: Very simple. Just buy and hold.
Cons: You will miss out on actually owning Bitcoin. That means you cannot use it in the future. You also miss out on any free forks and airdrops that require a real Bitcoin wallet. You don't get to really experience what cryptocurrency is. They treat it as a stock.
@_date: 2018-05-01 00:42:19
it's either that , hold what you got. or panic sell. typically the first choice is best. we all know dam well it's gonna go pass 10k soon. why not stock up and x more.
Oh BTW i sold at 9.4. i was not waiting around for the mt. gox dude to sell off. im not doing it outta fear or anything. i just want more =)

It's a trap guys. There has literally been nothing but good news lately. The Whales are trying to FUD you into selling before next week's summit so they can buy lower.
@_date: 2018-05-09 01:35:37
Okay i realized you must be a kid who does not know anything about money. It's not all about you. Just because you don't pay fees when you shop and use your card, does not mean the merchant does not have to pay a fee.  I dare you to try to send 10k grands over seas and tell me how that goes. How long it takes and how hard you have to try to get that fee reduced. OFX is the only closest thing you can do but why is it so hard in general? There is no need for banks when everyone holds their own "checking account" wallet. Yes that affects them severely. They can't use your money for loans when they don't hold it. You think the bank magically has money to give out as loan? It's your money dumbass. I'm done. I can't even lol

No one FUD! It's a trap, so they can buy in cheaper. It's gonna go back up in no time.
@_date: 2018-04-10 05:35:18
If this year follows the last two years, price will start rising in Mid April-May. If you are waiting for a really low bottom then you have about a week or so, safer to just buy now because it doesn't look like it can get much lower. It has tried many times. The only reason it can get lower then 6.5k now is if a huge whale tries to FUD everyone so they can buy even lower before May. Jus my two cents. You can check out last year's early April and see for yourself, it was pretty much sideways too just like now.
In addition to that, The lowest last year's April fell was just about the price of their previous November Which is where we about stand right now. Our price is matching November's price. It shouldn't get much lower even if it does. So buy or miss the train. Again just my opinion and guess. I am 50% sure that I am 100% right. LOL
@_date: 2018-04-06 23:13:16

@_date: 2018-04-07 08:14:12
Yep, because if such bot did exist, stock market and bitcoin would have been dead in a week of existence. Pretty rational conclusion really.
@_date: 2018-04-10 05:51:51
I know its really unpredictable but you can't say that there is no pattern if you zoom out and look at the graph, that would be a lie. Does it mean it will repeat again this year? Who knows. But to say there is no pattern from the previous years is just ignorant. 
If you keep watching the daily graphs of course it's gonna go up and down. If you look at the Q1 trend as a whole, it only went down. So......"went down and then right back up and then down again and up" is meh....
@_date: 2018-04-07 08:10:59
Then why are you people even here if that's what you truly believe? You like donating them money? If that is really the case, you cannot win. Stock Market wouldn't exist, Bitcoin will die. Use your head dude. It doe not make sense.
@_date: 2018-04-11 06:48:23
The low dips are slowly going up as i predicted Where my crystal ball at?
@_date: 2018-04-10 06:54:28
The reason will be whales. There literally were no reasons for last year's price pump either except whales got involved. And a few of the really big whales are already eyeing cryptocurrencies. More will come. Even Jeffrey Sprecher said to not rule out crypto joining his New York Exchange. I think last year really drew their attention.
@_date: 2018-04-07 06:11:31
Source of what? It's like.... Logically common sense. Source of regular people's bot? It's called Profit Trailer. And no those bots won't make you rich. Bots can't think. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 21:16:01
That is also my prediction. Happens every year at this time. Tax refunds add up lol
@_date: 2018-04-07 06:44:22
Thats exactly what i just said. With the exception that whales will not let automated bots freaking trade millions of dollars without their supervision. They are manually triggering the automated programs. Meaning they are actually doing the thinking, they just let the macros do the dirty clicking work. People like to cry "AI Bots" because they for some reason don't think whales are smart enough to be beating them in the market.
@_date: 2018-04-10 22:26:33
Be careful with ALTs. They are high risk high reward. The safest investment is BTC since it is still the mother of all coins. But the returns on ALTs will be really high if you pick the right one. Or lose it all lol
@_date: 2018-04-12 10:07:49
It's not easy enough to use yet. True, it is not a stock but at this early stage it is more like a startup company then a currency. We are all investors of blockchain technology. We believe in it. One day when it succeeds, I wouldn't mind if we all got rich. I invested in it while others laughed at me for years, so why not? You don't look at early Facebook holders and say that they don't deserve to be millionaires now (btw most of them cashed out and retired). Same concept.
@_date: 2018-04-03 02:05:26

@_date: 2018-04-10 00:54:58
This trend is never gonna stop if everyone is just sitting on the side waiting for a miracle. The whales found their new strategy. The price is just gonna go sideways with sudden pumps/dumps everyday. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 08:11:47
@_date: 2018-04-07 01:06:35

I mean I was gonna say thanks for the price jump the last 24 hours Amigos but nvm. Phuck U Too!
@_date: 2018-04-01 16:28:29
That's really incredible when u think ab it. They have to Target every exchange from RobinHood which is mobile only right now, to coinbase, to even the small unknown exchanges. All at the same time and the final prices after the pumps/dumps are only off from each other by a few dollars. I think it's rich organized groups rather than bots.
@_date: 2018-04-07 04:08:39
At most the "Bots" they use are just a program that helps them make massive trades on all exchanges at the press of a button. Which is more like a macro more than anything. People talk about these "Bots" as if they are getting beat in the market by smart AIs. Bots suck at trading. If they were so good, Day Trading in stocks and crypto would make you a millionaire. All they can do is automate what the user wants it to do. So even without blaming the "Bots", the Whales would still own you without using automated software.

@_date: 2018-04-06 23:47:38
Honestly.... buy now. And hide your wallet. Don't do what i did. It took over my life watching the graphs everyday. The only people who got rich in December were the people who bought some a long time ago and forgot they had it. Everyone else buys and sells too often which is a mistake that i also made. But yes that amount is enough to make you rich in the future.
@_date: 2018-04-25 18:55:28

and...... its gone.
@_date: 2018-04-10 01:30:31
They don't care about Bitcoin, they are just manipulating the market to make daily gains from fomoing/fuding normal people. That's what i meant when i said they found a new strategy, they don't have to make bitcoin price go high to make profit. And when normal folks are all too scared to buy alot right now, the only people who can bring the price up really are the whales.
@_date: 2018-04-12 11:11:53
This dump is gonna hurt.
@_date: 2018-04-08 07:59:48
They won't make you money dude. They are only good for whales to keep volume going. They serve no other purpose. There are some like Profit Trailer that only helps you earn a few bucks here and there IF the market is good but you would make even more by holding in a good market so no point.

So these whales.... How exactly are they doing it? How do they get every single exchange to pump and dump all at the same time? That's really organized. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 18:45:48
The whales are trying to make you think the price is dropping. You can clearly see the last few hours where they dumped and the price went down like 3 times. But then you  also see the price gradually go back up naturally by us normal people.
@_date: 2018-04-01 16:36:53
How would people from RobinHood know that prices are pumping on binance down to the last second? There's no sell/buy orders listed or anything. Just a graph. Like if that were the case everytime binance pumps people on Robin hood could make quick money from the advantage of knowing then right? Oh and not to mention every single altcoin follows at the exact same second too.

@_date: 2018-04-10 07:01:56
It's not people's fault. The world has not caught up to BTC yet. Right now you are pretty much investing in the tech, it's not easy to spend it. It's because of these early investors that BTC can even become mainstream. It's because of them that places will accept it more. It also is a huge risk, so let them have a little reward.
@_date: 2018-04-06 22:33:03

Allot of people still waiting on the sideline because they think it's a trap. If a whale is smart, they would pump at least one more time before dumping to earn peoples trust back into BTC. After that, it might even grow naturally even with their dumps.

Weekend Gains are back wow. Can't wait til Monday, I have Stocks in DPW and BTC price affects it's price, it's gonna be �� season opening hour lol get rekt son!
@_date: 2018-04-12 11:29:50
So much volume my browser keeps crashing.
@_date: 2018-04-04 20:44:51
Because having the option to sell high and use that same money to buy 10X the amount of bitcoins you just sold is a normal thing to want?
@_date: 2018-04-10 05:55:42
That sir... is pretty much exactly how it works lol. 
@_date: 2018-04-07 15:09:25
So you sir know the facts bout the whole system. How many lambos u have? There are no facts about any of this. Are you aware that you are doing the same thing I am doing? Spreading false talks about a super smart AI bot that will take all your money. Yea.....

Just a correction. 2 weeks of gains minus about 4 days of progress sounds about right. Can't get much lower then this. If it does, we are doomed.
@_date: 2018-04-26 23:07:41
That's typically how it goes. The hype will build itself up so fast and then people taking profits right before the event. Pump the News Dump the Event.
@_date: 2018-04-12 23:48:20
Just the Tip? =D
@_date: 2018-04-15 19:03:13
A week ago I told everyone to buy. This is gonna run until May at least before a big correction. It's literally in the last few year's graphs.
@_date: 2018-04-06 23:45:36
No sir, phuck you! It's been over!!!
@_date: 2018-04-26 04:36:28
This just in....... Bitcoin is Volatile. *gasp* 
@_date: 2018-04-13 00:54:20
I don't disagree with you, just saying dang, if you got a crystal ball to know the exact number like that, gimme Lambo too!
@_date: 2018-04-13 08:17:44
oh no don't gimme that. You said buy now before it hit 8.17 because you can never buy it at that price again. guess what? it's that price again lol. everyone knew it was gonna go up that high, your specific ass prediction of 8.17 and to the moon was wrong though. just sayin
@_date: 2018-04-10 20:35:36
Not sure if the bear market is over, but I do think we found the bottom already.
@_date: 2018-04-10 08:37:28
Kind of hard to do when BTC is still the main coin used to exchange those ALTs. 
@_date: 2018-04-01 17:28:31
That's like.... Basic whale knowledge that everyone knows.
@_date: 2018-04-07 01:35:19
Whales don't use bots. I don't know where that assumption came from. Normal people use bots. Whales have a big ass room full of screens and people who will all pump and dump at the same time on every exchange. They then monitor to see how the market repsponds then make their next move. The big ass volume bars are from whales buying a shit ton when they see that all orders are pretty cheap. Then when they see people having orders that they would pay allot for coins. They dump. There is no need for them to use bots, they have a better chance making money with trading organizations. Noone would trust millions to a bot. They are highly organized, that's why most people seem to keep losing to the markets manipulation. Somehow the market is always against them. The whales actually are working hard, they are monitoring every buy/sell orders and strategizing. I guess people would like to think it's bots to make them feel better about losing their money.
@_date: 2018-04-04 23:25:45
Didn't say it was gonna happen. Just saying people like having that option available. And based on what happened the last few years, people are willing to take a chance that it will happen again...And it did.
@_date: 2018-04-26 00:35:53
Whales know how to set up bear traps on land. The end is near folks. Hide yo kids and wives.
@_date: 2018-04-07 06:46:23
You don't wanna hump whales sideways anymore, you prefer they do the reverse cowgirl. Got it.
@_date: 2018-04-06 11:17:44
6500 LOL. i said fuck it I'll wait til Summer
@_date: 2018-04-15 20:00:55
Yep. Because I told people About...A..We3k..Ago ��
@_date: 2018-04-03 04:14:59
Did Whale season just start? 
@_date: 2018-04-07 00:21:38
Dang all that research money and you still got it wrong. It could also stay there forever!
@_date: 2018-04-07 17:00:53
Yea I was just poking fun of all the times people posted the fact that they were in the shower and a huge dip happens or something. It's a common occurrence in this place lol
@_date: 2018-04-12 07:46:59
Are you gonna take it out of the Hot Wheels package and play with it or just leave it as display?
@_date: 2018-04-25 19:16:03
May 11th
@_date: 2018-04-06 11:12:47
Of course it pumps after i call it quits, of course it did.
