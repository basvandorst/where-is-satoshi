All 21 million bitcoin are not in circulation, and many never will be. Satoshi mined over 1,000,000 at the start and those will never be spent. Plenty of wallets have been irredeemably lost.

Read up on the lightning network and atomic swap. These advancements will lead to fast, low fee transactions that will make Bitcoin more viable as a currency.
    
With greater adoption, volatility will decrease. That, combined with using a fraction of a Bitcoin as a standard unit, will make it accessible to the masses.
    
We are still in the early adopter phase of Bitcoin. You can treat it like some cash cow to profit from in the short run, but I see the utility and, frankly, necessity for such a currency in a world rife with corporate and government corruption.

What if the recipient of the message is not usually sensible, but the embarrassment gets through to them? Shame, anger, embarrassment, these can all be powerful motivators.

I tried to report you for acting like a basic redditor, then realized I'm on the wrong sub.

It needs to be normie simple. The day I can walk into a shop, pull out my phone, scan the vendors phone, and the transaction is complete, that is the day we will see massive adoption of Bitcoin

It's not about understanding the actual algorithms or programming of the product. You use a credit/debit card every single day and have no idea how the technology behind it works, generally speaking.
    
What is import to understand is the use case. Being able to transact with another human being without corporate or government intervention has value. Have an asset that cannot be seized or frozen by conventional means has value. Not requiring a state ID and a birth certificate to create a wallet has value. Most people are capable of understanding these concepts without being able to program the underlying technology.

My guess, and it is just a guess because I dont know shit about finances and this statement should not be construed as financial advise, my guess is that the current rise in price is due to accumulation by institutional investors. Your average Joe has a lot more to lose in a downturn and thus has a weaker hand and greater propensity to panic sell. Institutions are in it for the long haul and will not sell, even in instances where the price rapidly dips by 10%.

I am not saying that this is the case, but what if having their ignorance rubbed in their face caused a person to reevaluate their assumptions and grow as a person? Maybe caused them to be concious of knee-jerk reactions and instead temper their beliefs with evidence?    
    
In such a case, would it still be unhealthy for the original recipient of criticism to point out how the outcome differed from the critics assumptions?

Bitcoin is a protocol, not a tangible good. It can be updated and improved.
    
There may be something in the future that surpasses cryptocurrencies as an easily transmittable store of value, but the idea that another crypto will replace bitcoin is misleading.

You don't need a state ID to get a bitcoin wallet, and no one can freeze it because you expressed the wrong political opinion. A state-run cryptocurrency doesn't seem much different to me than electronic transactions with fiat.

This is a very unscientific approach, but my stance is this: When has the general public ever been right about anything? The general public was skeptical of the internet. The general public can't decide if eggs are good for you or bad for you. The general public tries gluten free diets without any understanding of what gluten is or that such products only exist because of gluten allergies, not any associated health benefits. The general public still thinks vaccines cause autism.
    
When I hear the general public and bankers parroting "bubble. tulip bulbs", I take that as an indication that we are not even close to the level of value that Bitcoin will ultimately provide.

What makes you uncertain that bitcoin is a good thing? It allows people in wartorn countries to store currency that can't be physically stolen from them by the local warlord. It allows countries with failing economies to participate in the world market. It is decentralized, and requires majority action and adoption to be changed, unlike the banking industry that nearly destroyed the world economy in the 2000s.
    
The only downside of bitcoin that I've seen is that some people use it for crimes. The same way they use cash for crimes.
