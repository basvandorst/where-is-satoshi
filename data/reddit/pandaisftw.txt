What are you talking about? You can compile it yourself, you don't need someone "reputable" to compile it. Relying on reputable people to tell you what to think is basically centralization - make your own judgment. 


Again, you can compile the source code yourself (extremely easy, google how to compile on your system and you're good to go), and check out the features if you don't trust the binary. 
Btw, it's been like this for the last dozens of releases. NXT source code because opensource months ago. Also, every release of the client conveniently contains the sourcecode within the same folder.
I noticed a common theme from your posts is that you don't "know all the details", why do you keep stating this instead of researching the details? To get you started:
These are all great sources if information.
@_date: 2014-05-11 23:04:52
Hi aminok, several redditors have already linked you to the NXT sourcecode:
The latest release (1.1.0 - 3 hours ago) is on there, what "advanced features" are being "delayed"?
Also, please cite your accusations, thanks.
@_date: 2014-05-12 02:32:13
I don't know how much more credible the source code can get. It's all there, anyone can take a look for him/her-self. 1.1.0 is the newest version that people can run at the moment - it's the version I'm running.

With all due respect - if you are not interested enough to confirm it yourself, you should stop spreading FUD. 
Check out those links, you'll see that there is nothing hidden. Why don't you suggest "someone" reputable and then send him an email asking for him to confirm that the NXT source code is up to date? Why does it fall on me or anyone else to do so? If *you* want to make an accusation (that the source code is not open, when everyone else besides FUDsters say it is), then *you* should provide the evidence.
If you refuse to do even that, I suspect you have some other agenda.
PS: I'm pretty reputable, I have taken a look at the source code, and I can confirm it is up to date. In fact, the source code even contains the code when certain landmark blocks (such as the Asset Exchange, which as of block 135000 became live - just 5 minutes ago) are up and coming.
@_date: 2014-05-12 19:33:00
No, given NXT's reputation, it's been known it is open source for many months now. You are purposely keeping your head in the sand (even when I have provided many links that provide tons of information) by refusing to do any research yourself. The very fact that there are clones of NXT in development (one is already out) should show you that it's open source.
I don't think you understand what open source really means. Open source means anyone can look at the code, not just certain "reputable" and "privileged" individuals.


Good, because this is a decentralized community. Or are only people with certain amounts of power and influence allowed to make statements?

If you give me a few reasons as to why litecoin will overtake bitcoin or at least be on par, I promise I will consider it carefully. Faster tx times? Not a concern because bitcoin's network is so large that it would take so much cpu power and money just to steal a bag of groceries. I imagine for large purchases, waiting 30 minutes for 3 confirms is not a big deal when 100k's are on the line.
I have invested in other alt currencies, because they have the potential to offer something bitcoin does not. Litecoin does not offer anything over bitcoin, not that I know of at least. If you do, please let me know!

You really don't get it do you? You *buy* the PS4, it's not free. It's only "free" if Sony straight up gave it to you for free.
You making money on the market is no different than making money with a job. Just because it seemed like you put no "effort" in, that does not make it "free magic money". This is called making your money work for you, which is an important concept you need to understand if you want to get ahead in life. Why do you think so many people put money into savings/IRAs? So that account will make money for them when they retire.

We are on the same wavelength. As long as you are buying at opportune moments, and not just "dollar cost averaging" where you just buy, for example, once a week, that's fine. All I meant was the putting money over time did not *automatically* make it investing.

You keep the bitcoin over litecoin for the same reason you keep AUD over cryptocurrencies: nearly $12bil of market cap vs. $500mil. Many more people use bitcoin, it has the biggest ecosystem and it less volatile than altcoins.
I read somewhere that if an altcurrency beat bitcoin, that would be the end of (limited-supply) cryptocurrencies because it would demonstrate that all coins with fixed supply limits are artificially overvalued, as there are an infinite amount of altcoins that can be made to increase the supply. Litecoin would also fail, since it has a limited supply as well. And then we would end up back in the "printing money" situation many people invested in cryptocurrencies want to avoid. The technology would survive perhaps, but fiat would still be dominant as people would simply use the network as a payment system (like credit card) and cryptocurrencies will lose their property of being a store of value.
So interestingly enough, the thing that is most likely to cause cryptocurrencies to implode on themselves... is cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:02:15
I agree. At least they aren't pulling a Mt. Gox and saying, "Whoops, we could not deliver your coins on time" 3 months later. They're letting people know straight-up they are out of coins at the moment.
At worst, they'll have more tomorrow. I was about to drop $1k this morning when price was $500, but I refreshed one too many times and they ran out when I finally decided to buy. But that may not be so bad, who knows what going on with bitstamp atm.
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:55:42
I use bitstamp. From what I hear, it's impossible to withdraw USD from mt. gox, so that's why I'm staying away from that.
BTC-e works too, but I trust bitstamp more (coinbase prices are based off of bitstamp prices, so there's that.)

Deflation is bad for everyone from an economical standpoint. (Economical standpoint meaning people are making rational and informed decisions.) Like you said, it could be good for "savers", ie. people who never spend. However, people who never spend don't put money into the economy. If deflation was high enough, more and more people would opt to hoard instead of spend, thus slowing economic growth. The growth could slow to a point where the economy would enter a recession. 
This is a similar reason as to why you see posts here encouraging people to spend bitcoins. If everyone is simply hoarding bitcoins because they see the value going up and use it as an investment vehicle instead of currency - and bitcoin does not end up being adopted by merchants at a fast enough rate - when the bubble does pop, it will crash a long way down.
FYI, as a saver, you can put your capital in extremely low risk investments/portfolios/whatever and you will usually beat the inflation rate. So as a saver, you won't lose money even now unless you literally stash all your money as cash under your bed (which is a bad idea, for many other reasons as well).

Do you even understand what a circlejerk is? It's not necessarily the content being posted, it's the mindset of the people browsing this subreddit. Just look at OP - everyone who apparently "disagrees" with the price going up and up, is a shill. 
Claims of market manipulation is part of the denial phase associated with post-crash. No one complained of market manipulation when whales were pumping up the price last week.

There's a list of a bunch. Things different, like Peercoin. And keep in mind, it's only a small portion of my portfolio, no more than 5-10%. But I mainly look for alts that offer something completely different, not more of the same. Which is why I'm having trouble with litecoin at the moment, as I can't see how it differentiates itself.
Also, at your own risk:
There are a lot of start-up alt currencies, so if that's your thing, you may find one that really catches your eye. I found one with a lot of potential and invested early, but I'll see where it goes.

Just because you put in your money "over time" does not make it automatically "investing". Putting all your money in at once can be investing too, if you had good knowledge of the market and how it works (ie. not buying at the top and buying on dips).
@_date: 2013-11-18 05:17:34
No, long term deflation is bad for savers (as well as everyone else), as eventually the money they are saving is worth nothing if the economy deflates to nothing. When I said deflation could be "good", I was saying savers would benefit from deflation in a localized sense (short-term). But if the economy keeps deflating (because everyone is saving since the value of each dollar is going "up"), eventually it will collapse, thus the money you've been saving all this time will be worth nothing.

Frankly, this post is very disappointing. Their marketcap is not "pointless" because their entire supply is available from the start. If people didn't like the price *per coin*, they wouldn't invest. The number of total coins does not matter. 
People need to recognize that there is a paradigm shift from forked shitcoins to a new generation of coins. By removing them from your list, you are doing everyone a disservice (including bitcoin investors). I honestly thought most people invested in bitcoin were above suppressing freedom of information and speech, yet OP wants to do exactly that.
@_date: 2013-11-15 21:06:10
I don't know... don't you have to factor in opportunity costs? If you invest all the money that you spent on your rig into litecoin (or other altcoins), chances are, at least in the case of litecoin, you would have doubled your money already instead of just recently breaking even.
@_date: 2013-12-19 20:28:16
Please explain?
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:54:07
I think there's a large spread is because:
1) Coinbase ran out of stock within minutes this morning (as well as all of yesterday)
2) Bitstamp bank code is not working for some (most?) people, further reducing incoming funds.
3) Less funds in bitstamp = lower prices
It possibly could be that China is dumping CNY into USD, but why don't they just keep their BTC rather than taking a huge loss selling at bitstamp for fiat? Doesn't make much sense... especially when BTC is poised to rise next week with all the positive news lately. We even got the correction out of the way (whether or not this is a bulltrap remains to be seen).

I rarely see claims of positive market manipulation on this subreddit. On yes, no.
Obviously OP doesn't represent everyone here, but the fact that OP's post is near the top with tons of upvotes of this subreddit indicates many people do agree with OP's viewpoint. 
Nobody here wants to see bitcoin fail (otherwise we wouldn't be investing in it, right?), but sometimes you have to face the facts and realize in the short term bitcoin will have bubbles and it's not "to the moon" all the time. That's what I mean by circlejerk. Most people don't want to face the negatives even when the market is crashing around them. Thus, posts like OP's are created, more in denial than anything else really.

A few days ago my econ professor asked my class (keep in mind, these are techy 20-year-olds) who had heard of bitcoin. Less than 1/3rd had even heard about it. 
But she didn't have anything negative to say about it, she just kind of mentioned how much the price has risen.
IMO, there's not much to discuss about bitcoin in a classroom setting. It's new, and unproven, thus unlikely to be part of any curriculum for another few years.

If you're betting that the dollar will suddenly become deflationary from now till the end of time and sit under your bed increasing in value, then no, that is not an economical, informed or rational decision. Unless, of course, these funds were illicit, but that would be a different topic. 
A rational saver would put his or her money in a in safe bets such as portfolios, IRAs, etc. that would give them returns above inflation rate. As far as I know, this is what most Americans do with their non-essential money.

The only issue that you would run into as a newcomer is actually getting money into the system. Pretty much with any method you chose (besides localbitcoins maybe, I've never used it so I can't comment on that) will take 1 week+ in order to get your money into BTC.
I believe coinbase recently made it so if you verify your credit card (along with everything else) you can buy 1BTC a week instantly. I feel that would be the best starting point. EDIT: However, coinbase is out of coins at the moment.

Explain how altcoins can help with arbitrage? If, for example, the arbitrage opportunity is caused by lack of funds leaving (mt gox), then BTC/LTC arbitrage won't solve that. Also, how does it help bitcoin miners if they are mining on the litecoin network, thus their hashrate is not helping the bitcoin network?
I always see these short statements, but without evidence to show it actually means anything. Do you have some sort of data, or even economic theory (links please) that backs up these statements?
I agree it can be a "backup" and "testing" coin, but it can be at $1 LTC and still accomplish that goal. So expecting a raise in value simply because it's a backupcoin seems flawed.

Mt. Gox is bad for getting USD from because a) they don't have the cash on hand (thus a 3 or more month wait for some people) b) people not putting cash into gox because of said reputation. So they have to draw USD from elsewhere, which may take time.
Brokers are intended to make the process of transferring between USD and BTC very easy. Coinbase fills this role, with a fee on top of course.
If you're just starting out, I would buy from coinbase, transfer those coins to an exchange (I use bitstamp), do whatever there. When you want to cash out, send coins back to coinbase and sell. No need to do wire transfer to foreign countries, they withdraw and deposit the cash directly back using your bank account.
I'd trust coinbase, as it's a US based company. That, and they have a pretty good track record. I've always gotten all my coins on time and never had a problem with them rejecting my payments. If you verify your credit card info, you can even get a limited amount of instant bitcoins.
If you're holding, the $5 per BTC (or whatever the fee is now) is going to be pocket change in the long run. The important thing, if you believe in the potential of BTC, if to get your money into BTC as soon as you can.

@_date: 2013-11-29 23:27:56
No, it won't help with arbitrage if the issue is getting USD out of the exchange. There's only so much fiat within a particular exchange. If you use BTC to buy LTC, BTC price will go down and LTC price will go up. So while it may have a small balancing effect within the exchange, the issue is that people still can't cash out, thus there will still be higher prices within that particular exchange. So even if you switch your BTC into LTC on Gox, then move your LTC to bitstamp and sell for USD, all that is doing is raising prices on Gox, and lowering prices on bitstanp, the same situation we have now. So basically, until gox fixes their cash problem, no amount of altcoins will close the arbitrage gap. Logical?
And technically, needing altcoins so miners can mine the most profitable one is kind of a circular argument. If there were no altcoins, the most profitable coin to mine would be bitcoin, right? So in essence, miners looking for profitable altcoins to mine is a solution looking for a problem.

Okay that's great, but I'm talking about larger market movements which follow an oscillatory pattern. This is a fact. And I did not attribute the rise in price to one thing. Take note. (If I did, please show me what I attributed it to. Hint: You can't.)
Downvotes changed to upvotes? What? I didn't touch anything. Again, you're in your own little world. It's hilarious to see you call me paranoid.

It may sound weird that they are taking a neutral stance, but I think they know the importance of not falling behind on this. I figure the US has a good nose for staying ahead, as the country pretty much started the automobile industry, the internet, etc.

This is false. You are putting words in my mouth. If you entire argument hinges on putting words in my mouth, then you really don't have an argument. It's kind of sad you can't see past your own ego, but to each their own.
There was no shouting and insulting, at least none that you didn't start first ;) Who started with "backpedaling, editing, infant, bolding-like-a-5-year old"? That's you, not me. 
Again, you keep ignoring the main point, and the only point in this debate: I did not say anything about a rally. I don't even know why we are debating this - it's cold hard fact. 


I guess you also missed the news about overstock today. You don't news much, do you?
Yes? Do you understand TA? Anyone with any knowledge of the markets knows that we are still in a downtrend. That is cold hard fact as well. But interesting you would bring that into this discussion, again proving that you have nothing to say that is relevant and instead again try to attack my character. 
(BTW, it's *childish* to keep downvoting me, but I guess continue if that makes you happy.)
EDIT: Also, you failed to "put it in bold like a 5 year old" for me.

Wait... so how does one get USD into BTC currently? (Besides waiting for coinbase to replenish their coins).
And I guess an upside is that they're taking care of server issues now, rather than when there's a huge influx of people in the next week trying to put money in and finding out they cannot.

What'd going on?

Expand on this please.

It did pop. We're gonna be at these levels for many days to come.

No one is forcing you to use mBTC, just like no one is forcing you to use BTC right now. However, the goal is to make mBTC the "base price" in people's heads, because paying 0.006 BTC for a subway sandwich is an unnecessary hassle when you could be paying 6 mBTC.
So you will still be able to use BTC whenever you want, just like I can say "one-tenth of a hundred dollar bill" if I'm talking about a ten-dollar bill. Doesn't make sense, but no one is stopping you. I imagine most sites and exchanges will give you the option to switch between different scales, but for actually purchasing things, buying and advertising things in mBTC makes a lot more sense at the moment.

 &gt;Not an untruth but rather an opinion. Yes I understand the statement "stealing prosperity from tomorrow to spend it today" is a bit extreme but it's to get a point across.
Not sure how that is an opinion, what he stated is an economic fact. If you can make more money in the future by borrowing today vs. not borrowing, you should borrow. I mean, that's how most small businesses are started. Then he states whether or not the government is actually making more money on their borrowing is a different discussion. The debate is whether or not the government is making wise borrowing decisions, not on the economic theory. 


Most of the inflation is caused by the FED printing money, not banks lending. 


You're forgetting interest. Would you assume the risk of lending a stranger $1,000,000 for zero return? Scaled down, the same concept applies to $100. Even if there is no interest (ie. you lending your money to a close friend), $100 today is worth less than $100 in the future (when you get your money back) due to inflation. You can't just "ignore" interest just because it paints a prettier picture, just like I cant just "ignore" physics and claim a perpetual motion machine exists.
Also, your example is flawed, even *without* interest. In your scenario, Person A owes Person B, Person B owes Person C, and Person C owes Person A. Let's say Person A initiates the initial borrowing, so the picture looks like this:
Step 1
Person A: +$100
Person B: -$100
Person C: $0
Step 2
Person A: +$100
Person B: $0 (Since he is borrowing from person C to replace his loss)
Person C: -$100
Step 3
Person A: $0
Person B: $0
Person C: $0 (Person C borrows from Person A)
Sticking with no interest, **the net debt is $0 because the amount of money that left the system is $0**. The most debt at any one time within the system is $100. Even if Person A splurged that $100, thus making the picture:
Step 4
Person A: -$100
Person B: $0
Person C: $0
... and then made back the $100, you would end back up in Step 3.
If we were to follow your example, say, if I passed a $100 bill from my left hand to my right hand, and then passed it from my right hand to my pocket, and then from my pocket to my left hand again, would I suddenly be $300 in debt? No, I wouldn't. Otherwise, I could pass the $100 between myself 1000000000kkkkkkkkkx times and claim I'm in trillions upon trillions in debt. 
But that is all fantasy. With interest in the picture, your scenario is purely fiction and has no bearing on the real world. Thus, you have not proved anything. 
FYI, the government CAN pay off a significant portion of it's debt, but whether or not this is a wise choice is a different debate. But, basically, if the government's borrowing is increasing national GPD faster than what the government is losing in paying interest, borrowing is not necessarily a bad thing. Also, there will be repercussions from paying off debt too fast, namely slowing down economic growth (growth is important because that's what keeps the US ahead of other countries). So again, the question is whether or not this is the case.

I did not say anything of the sort, so again, you're trying to imply that I said things that I never did.
As far as I'm concerned, this exchange is over. Your continued use of ad hominem attacks accusing me of "backpedaling" and "editing" show you really have no argument. If you can actually quote me, and debate on what I said (instead of putting words in my mouth), then perhaps we'll have a useful debate.
