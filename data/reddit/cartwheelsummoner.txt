Like everyone else said, get in now and hold for a very long time. It is incredibly volatile and not worth trying to analyze the market.

As incredibly dumb this is, I lost 0.1 btc day trading last year while on paternity leave. Same dumb, different boat. Had a lot of time on my hands (4 months) and studied like crazy. Worked out for me mostly but had one really incredibly bad emo trade.
Meh, you get over it and get back into the investing long term hold instead.

One could say it’s a new level, of confidence and power.

Agreed, has nothing to do with bitcoin whatsoever. 
Example: An Elon Musk account randomly msgs you to mail cash and get triple in return, sounds dumb right? An Elon Musk account msgs you to PayPal x dollars as a gift and will triple your return back to your PayPal, sounds dumb right? User error, placing blame anywhere but yourself is ignorant.

To what Andreas has pointed out that is until you get an email of their TOS changes with 600 pages of gibberish around it. No more hidden transactional data. 
It’s 100% happening whether at launch, or soon there after.

Chuck E. Cheese is still around? Shit lol. I figured they’d bankrupt themselves from too many ballpit purchases by now.

The psychology around ad targeting and product creation based on data collection is a very sick rabbit hole. Especially when most of it will be targeted towards kids and easily manipulated adults all the while making a handful of people ultra rich off of it and knowing your every move. It’s a thousand times worse than “knowing what toilet paper you buy.” 
Facebook already has probably more than 75% of everyone’s day to day life/interests who uses their app(s). This zuckbuck is going complete that remainder of what they’re missing for full power of knowledge on their user base.

Ya, I opened a Traditional IRA with Vanguard to roll this over to avoid any penalty or taxes, and planned to move it there for that purpose, but then the thought of bitcoin crossed my mind. 
Once I’m stable with a new job here soon I will start up normally again for their 401k of course.
