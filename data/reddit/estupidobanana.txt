Research first, discussion later. You didn’t even get the point Andreas was making. Try a bit harder, nothing personal!

Shitcoins are bad karma. Don’t hedge gold with manure.

Depends how big your transaction was in Bytes. In Bitcoin you don’t pay a percentage fee, it’s based on the size. The mempool tiers are also displayed in terms of price per byte or kilobyte.

Building a house is a good shout. Building a renewable power plant would be awesome too.

Is this a serious question?
@_date: 2019-07-30 05:53:27
If a central bank is buying gold to extend its reserve, sitting in vaults is really the use of gold here, isn’t it?
@_date: 2019-07-28 20:57:10
Well the risk you’re describing is exactly why you’re getting interest. BlockFi are one of the pioneers, but so far I’ve only heard good things about them. Partnering with Casa now too, which is another reputable company. Seems legit, but I don’t have personal experience.

Disgraceful from Microsoft.

This ain’t no support group for traders.

That’s AnyDesk
+1 from me

Meltem is a legend.
@_date: 2019-07-23 19:26:25
@_date: 2019-07-11 11:45:37
WTF is this
@_date: 2019-07-27 11:16:51
They shouldn’t have bought it. Centralised service will always be dangerous, and here you have some of the consequences.
@_date: 2019-07-11 17:25:26
Oh, well you completely misunderstood his argument. He said it’s “one of the solutions to the scaling problem”. How is that “not a good solution”? Don’t be disingenuous.

Let’s not have this clown on this platform angmore
@_date: 2019-07-13 11:34:18
You know Bitcoin is the truth when people like Andreas are with us.
@_date: 2019-07-30 07:13:47
I would argue that people trust Bitcoin and use it (and I do think holding equals using) very much because of the verifiable stock and flow stability.
@_date: 2019-07-10 19:41:44
Stop watching the price mate. Go outside. Talk to a friend. Pet a dog. Bitcoin will be here when you’re back.

@_date: 2019-07-11 21:36:15
Yeah, a lot of people. Many banks are very anti crypto. Read the T&amp;C - you’re risking account closure, with many Us banks especially.
@_date: 2019-07-10 19:50:13
If you know Bitcoin even a little, you’d know nobody can answer that question, so why bother?
@_date: 2019-07-11 15:04:53
 That’s just the transaction fees.

@_date: 2019-07-13 11:33:02
Also interested. Happy with my Trezor but Coldcard looks super cool.
@_date: 2019-07-30 06:43:46
The stock to flow model works precisely because something like this doesn’t happen with gold, or silver, or bitcoin. Because we know that the stock is extremely stable.

Jesus what a horrible uninformed article about a moronic “ratings agency”...
@_date: 2019-07-11 22:48:44
Lol what have you “googled” dude.
@_date: 2019-07-12 20:04:28
Good man.
@_date: 2019-07-30 06:41:56
Oh I assume if it disappeared from Knox it would appear somewhere else, like the gold market presumably. You mean like if it got abducted by aliens? :D Sorry that’s a bit too wild for me.
@_date: 2019-07-12 08:00:45
It’s a quality exchange though. You get what you pay for!
@_date: 2019-07-27 10:53:17
If Github servers were in a neutral country, owned by an international entity, this wouldn’t have been a problem. Microsoft is to blame here.
@_date: 2019-07-13 09:55:53
Obey? We worship the rainbow chart.
@_date: 2019-07-28 21:16:57
Yeah, it’s a savings account! How else could they pay interest back?
@_date: 2019-07-27 10:14:42
“two sats” has a ring to it
@_date: 2019-07-27 22:00:49
You just hedged gold with horse manure.
@_date: 2019-07-23 21:35:34
Submit a post not about the price.
@_date: 2019-07-13 12:14:27
@_date: 2019-07-30 06:19:42
That’s a bold claim (: Don’t think I agree there.
@_date: 2019-07-17 19:34:07
Nope. Just think of a way of passing it to a family member in case you get hit by a bus.
@_date: 2019-07-12 17:51:46
@_date: 2019-07-14 05:12:33
Nope, I don’t like the design.
@_date: 2019-07-12 07:59:26
@_date: 2019-07-21 14:07:15
Why not?
@_date: 2019-07-13 10:28:22
Lol. That was great!
@_date: 2019-07-27 11:17:57
Should never have bought GitHub in the first place. How about you build something yourself for a change that’s worth anything, fucking Microsoft.
@_date: 2019-07-11 17:31:21
How about you do your own research? Check out Liquid for starters.
@_date: 2019-07-30 07:40:34
You mean you want a Bitcoin future?
