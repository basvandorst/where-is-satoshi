Can you share how you created this? I'd like to do this with fresh $2 bills for friends. It's a great idea and looks really nice.

You do realize that everything is on the blockchain, right? Nothing is actually on the Ledger except the private keys to sign a transaction to the blockchain.
Aka. Look at any block explorer online and verify your bitcoins which you originally sent to the ledger are still there. If they haven't moved, they are yours. If they are somehow in a different address, they are gone.

Realistically, probably a C8 Corvette. Ideally, Lamborghini Huracan Evo.
Because I think it's lost on people; Lamborghini's logo is a bull which is why we use it for the bull rally memes.

I'm with you. I did not support 2x because it felt rushed and was originally proposed back when I didn't see a problem with our network. As much as I want to stay on 1MB blocks, I think it's time we scale to 2MB blocks and force Segwit.
I think LN is the future and to use their analogy; LN is like a teleporter, but until that exists, I'd like to slightly increase the size of our highway to fix this standstill.

I’m not the best to answer, but do not type out the address online because someone may steal it if it’s the private key. I hope someone comes along to help you. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:06:19
No. It’s only the other way around because you hold the private key. You scan their code to see their public address. Then you use your private key to commit sending money to the address. If you could do it in reverse, then someone would be able to take your private key and steal all of your money. 
Edit: if you want to gift someone bitcoin, you can just make them a paper wallet. Be sure to give them the private key. They could then import that into the wallet of their choosing. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:55:43
Maybe Blockchain.info
It’s an online wallet. Did you have to make a password too?
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:19:11
Centralization due to block size. I'm more concerned with keeping BTC decentralized via smaller blocks. I look forward to the lightning Network for small transactions and find BCHs 8mb blocks to be a horrible decision to fill a temporary gap. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:23:40
Yeah. What the hell does that mean?! Haha
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:35:23
It's an exchange and not the network. If Microsoft makes it easier for people to buy and sell crypto, then hell yes I want them.
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:47:49
To be honest, 4MB is too much for me. I'm ok with 2MB + forced Segwit, but 4MB would make running a node way more difficult. I guess this is were the divide will start again. ��
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:21:59
I've bee trying to reach them for over 3 months. They still haven't solved my easy problem...
@_date: 2015-12-25 19:00:51
I don't have a betting ID yet, but thanks for the giveaway. I'm glad I got back into Bitcoin last month. I hope to hold and not try to play the market. I look forward to seeing how the blockchain will be used in 2016. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:00:04
I agree with you and hope all future discussions here are as civil. We all want this fixed. We are all in this together. It's time to do something. 
@_date: 2016-12-31 19:30:45
I mean, they are just following behind Google who has had this functionality for about 2 years now in Google Sheets...
=ROUND(GoogleFinance("CURRENCY:BTCUSD"), 2)
@_date: 2016-12-31 21:46:21
Not sure to be honest. I can check when I get home later tonight. 
@_date: 2016-12-31 19:29:57
I use
=ROUND(GoogleFinance("CURRENCY:BTCUSD"), 2)

@_date: 2019-08-02 12:39:44
I didn't know one existed anymore. That's awesome. I miss the old days where Reddit let you have BTC tipping bots on every subreddit.
@_date: 2019-02-14 21:11:04
I think this just replaces SWIFT for their clients. So they kind of already had a system in place, but they are trying to modernize.
While I think this is a silly implementation, it's at least nice that they are going to eat their own dog food. If more financial firms do this, they may see the benefits of opening their chain to the public Ethereum blockchain.
I agree with your last statement. Most of the hate here seems directed at the misconception that JPM wants us to buy their coin. Those users are misinformed or being deliberately ignorant. I am open to financial firms building their own "intranets". It legitimizes crypto to the average consumer and will eventually help us jump the gap to mass adoption.
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:38:47
Redditor for two days and you’re already begging for money?
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:57:44
As this point, I don’t give a shit what Satoshi’s original vision was. He is dead now and isn’t some sort of god.
I trust BTC because it actually has real developers working on improving the system. Sure it’s taking time to make changes, but thats expected for a project of this size and importance. I see BCH as a useless fork with no real future because of their team. If I wanted a coin for quick transactions to rival VISA one day, I wouldn’t be picking BCH.
I don’t really care for the “I’m closer to the original vision” arguments for either camp. I care most about future development and which chain I believe has the strongest future. That is why I currently support BTC. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 23:43:32
Thanks man! I hope you have something you really like and can buy one day too. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:58:38
You owe taxes on every purchase. That’s a tax nightmare. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:33:43
I still haven’t done this, but hope to in the next few weeks (I know I’m very late). Which exchange or site did you use to do the swap?
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:31:42
That’s not a Tesla, mate. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:51:07
I hope you get your account unlocked soon. I’m not sure what I can add at this point since the community has already started tweeting and getting you contact information. Good luck, and while I think everyone wants some free coins for their support, it may be better to spend that on a hardware wallet or use a mobile phone app like Bread (free). Keep us updated!
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:51:42
I agree with one of the commenters in here; I’d keep almost all of it to support my family, but I’d also save 20-50 bitcoins to give out to people on Reddit through a year or two. I’d be the bitcoin Santa. I would make sure I didn’t give to those with sob stories unless I can verify they are 100% real and not a fake story for donations. Instead, I’d randomly give to those who I see being helpful to new people, those who decide to spin up their first full node, and maybe those who I see post something creative/artistic. Again, I’d try to spread my giving out over the course of a year or two because I don’t want people to post about their nodes in hopes of me paying them a visit. It’s not the most creative idea, but I think I’d enjoy doing it and rewarding some of the positive people in our community. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 16:26:38
You restored my faith in our community. Thanks for being so nice to a random stranger.

From an investment standpoint maybe. If you get a special edition Lambo, the price will go up. See Aniversarios, Performantes, or 50th Edition lambos.
On the other hand, I only invest because I LOVE cars. Even if it was the worst decision of my life financially, I’d love to have a Lamborghini. It’s why I get up every morning and go to work. I drive when I’m happy, when I’m sad, and when I’m stressed. It’s the one thing in life that makes me feel free. Unfortunately, it’s an extremely expensive joy. Haha
@_date: 2017-11-20 04:23:24
I’m sure you’ll get in this week. I’m guessing Monday or Tuesday. Keep us posted and good luck!

Not with that attitude! Don’t let your dreams be dreams.

Look up Ledger Nano S. 
@_date: 2019-04-08 19:54:10
I can answer the second question. Lamborghinis and other exotics have a front lift system which can be activated while driving to get over obstacles or steep elevation changes. It's not a crazy high lift, but it's high enough that the front won't scrape what you're going over. I'm sure there are some videos online showing the system in action. It's pretty cool to see in person.
@_date: 2018-02-10 16:22:43
While funny, only a dumb person would use bitcoin for illegal activities. The ledger is public and there are infosec teams out there dedicated to mapping transactions back to a user. I don't care how many mixers you toss your coins through, you're still gonna get picked. Stick to USD and local deals.
@_date: 2017-10-30 02:51:44
They are gone forever.

I made one for 22k awhile back and never got to post it.... Hopefully one day I can.

It was supposed to be a crystal ball / globe with Bitcoin mooning inside. I'm not a great artist..
@_date: 2019-05-30 17:07:13
I used to run my own full node with a RaspberryPi and an SSD. This article reignited my desire to run a full node. Does anyone else have a better setup? Perhaps some ultra low power consumption PC that j can leave running 24/7 that's a bit more powerful than a Pi?
@_date: 2019-05-30 18:59:38
I will look this up. Thanks for sharing!
@_date: 2019-05-30 02:56:07
Thanks. I tried to make it look like price charts. It was hard getting it to look decent and not like a broken saw blade.

I spent a few hours tonight working on this piece. I uploaded it as a PNG with a transparent background just in case someone wanted to use it for something (non-commercial / non-monetization).
I'm not an amazing artist, but I'm having fun and wanted to contribute something. I hope you like it.
@_date: 2019-05-22 08:25:33
But this isn't a bank, right? Does Bitcoin fall under Singapore's banking laws?
@_date: 2019-05-28 10:32:32

Great idea. This is fun.

Thank you. I actually recreated him in HD before starting this piece and wanted to use him somehow. Credit to for originally creating the roller coaster guy and allowing everyone to meme with him.

I used Procreate on an iPad Pro, and thank you very much.
