Holding for a massive price increase.
Some say BTC will scale up to $500k by 2020. If that's the case why sell now.

There will not be a crash!!!! Bitcoin constantly corrects itself everytime it surges. People have been predicting this upcoming crash and the death of bitcoin since the coin reached $100.
There is nothing to suggest bitcoin will crash, it is completely different from our tool of value today (MONEY), yet most critics try to hold it to the same standard and or predict it will follow the same pattern.
One is controlled by then a central government and the other is a network that is not owned by anyone. To me, this seems no different than expecting physical laws to work in the world of quantum physics. They both have something to do with physic but are completely different systems. 
Just me venting

I bought 3 extra ones. 
I was really hoping the price would dip under $350

I may be completely wrong for thinking like this, but I have always believed that people's biggest issue is that they treat BTC like the currencies of the past instead of looking at it as a new technology. Bitcoin is a Digital System which for me means it should follow the same pattern of growth that all information technologies are following (Moore's Law, LOAR, etc). As a futurist who tries to understand these trends, these rises in value do not shock or scare me.

Chris Giancarlo and Senator Mark Warner seemed to be the only people to do their research before the came in today lol

That was Senator Mark Warner.
It seems Giancarlo and Warner are the only 2 in the room who understand the technology and history of BTC and crypto.
