Golden Rules:
1.) Research Research Research
2.) Don't invest more than you are willing to lose.
3.) Security is key
4.) HODL
Everything else (when to buy, what to purchase, best security device for your coins) is up to you and will likely be based on your constant diligence to rule 
Good luck!

I saw this and walked into a bar with only Koreans drinking right across from it (most bars here on the weekend are flush with soldiers from the nearby army base). I met some younger college-age dudes and asked them how often they use bitcoin while pointing at the sign. 
Surprisingly they said they do a majority of their shopping (retail, restaurants) in crypto (mostly BTC and LTC). They have more trouble at bars and with taxis because the owners of both, even in Itaewon, are older and harder to convince that the currency will stick around compared to the Won.
I think it's interesting to see the younger generations around the world getting into this, making me think that the crazy gains are nothing compared to the next 5-10-20 years as younger folks/early adopters move into power positions to make decisions about the currency.
HODL folks. We haven't seen anything yet.

Sounds like they would be the best person to ask, here's the site'8s about page: 
Really, the best way to "convert" won--&gt;BTC is probably just to buy. Bithumb is the largest Korea exchange.
Edit (from their FAQ): As far as we know, Bitcoin Center Korea is the only offline cryptocurrency-exchange establishment in Korea. How did it come to be, and what exactly do you guys do?
Contrary to popular belief, Bitcoin Center Korea is actually not an exchange but rather a community center and incubating space for software development. As a hub for Bitcoin enthusiast and travelers, we do allow P2P (peer to peer) exchange of Bitcoin to cash in Korean Won from time to time. We simply help educate our visitors how to use and trade Bitcoin, but the actual exchange happens amongst individual users. Since Bitcoin is a true peer to peer digital money, users can send/receive/exchange Bitcoins anywhere in the world without any third party trust as long as there is an internet connection. [Response Date: 2017-07-31]

It's taxed as short term capital gains on $14 ($6 burger, $8 fee). I'll mention it to my tax guy but he'll probably just laugh at me.
