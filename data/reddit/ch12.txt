Poor Charlie, he just can’t win with the accusations.

I listen to a lot of jam bands, and the general consensus in the community it to allow fans to tape and post show recordings for free. I've been hooked on Umphrey's McGee for years. Lately, lots of Spafford and Greensky Bluegrass in rotation. 
The quality of some recordings can be iffy, but there is a lot straight from the soundboard. Check out Spafford for sure, they are blowing up this year.

Hahah, yes. my thoughts exactly.

Awesome. I listen to live music recordings on their site quite a bit and I will be making a (much smaller) donation.

Sorry bud, I was already planning on winning. Called dibs on Saturday night after there wasn't a winner.

No. You can if you want, but GDAX is essentially Coinbase and they released the same exact statement.

Deposit USD to GDAX for less/no fee. Then buy btc from there. You’re gonna pay a shit ton of fees if you buy every day on coinbase.

So move funds off gdax just in case?

Very different from having it on a distributed ledger

People that bought this time last year and proceeded to sell at a loss are sending me this. I haven’t lost anything yet.
