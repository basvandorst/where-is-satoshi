Its faster to convert btc to another coin, anything else really , send it over a competitors network, then convert back to btc on the exchange / wallet. Thats what ive been doing since the network became unreliable.

Eventually, all stocks will be on a blockchain, all stocks will eventually be recorded on immutable ledgers and completely accounted for on the blockchain.  Clearing houses,  middle men, waits, will all be in a museum in 50 years. The financial services sector will all be in crypto , maybe not pow, but crypto nonetheless. So there will be a world with hunderds of thousands of cryptos. Make sense now

Im as bullish on btc as the next guy, but btc has some serious issues. All the new people coming in right now are getting serious bad experiences, extremely high fees, waiting days , a  week to get their tx confirmed without paying a 50 dollar fee,  btc just isnt updating fast enough, if this keeps up, people willuse a different , better product. Myspace vs fb, yahoo vs google, etc. 1st to market only takes you so far.

We are overbought on the rsi. All markets correct. Can happen anytime from now until the 15th. There are way too many buy orders in the 5 and 6000 range. It would take every billionaire in the world selling to get this thing down to 3 or 4k. Im pretty sure those days are gone. I'm guessing it will drop anywhere from 5 to 6,000 . that would be a normal healthy correction. We went from from 3000 to 7500 way too fast lol.

@_date: 2017-11-02 23:34:24
exactly. people seem to forget, although btc is 10 years old, it's still early stages. This thing is the internet of the 90's. your investing in the internet of the 90s basically. Its a gamble. Im not cherry coating anything. Nobody knows if btc will succeed, but i can say, blockchain is here to stay, and it is revolutionizing the world. The internet bubble did occur, but we are nowhere near those figures yet. people said bitcoin was in a bubble at 3$  lol. Even if it is a bubble, most bubbles , Like the internet bubble, fundamentally changed our world. As long as we keep in mind this thing is still in beta testing we're good. We will have corrections. we're speculating on new tech. It will solve the transaction times. Lightning network is working on alt coins. Once that gets implemented it can do transactions faster than visa. Once that occurs, the speculation is over, btc is accepted everywhere, and btc is also at 60,000 per coin. Your getting in early, even at 7,000.
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:51:04
You must not be in the know. Many countries have considered it legal tender and are already using it. Japan has 4500 stores using it. Me and my friends mainly transact in it.  In terms of inflation, fiat is an inflationary currency with the govt printing billions upon billions a year with no end in sight, and printing more just to pay off the interest on the debt, in which trump is removing the debt ceiling completely. Btc is deflationary, meaning theres less to go around as time goes on, and the amount cannot be inflated.

Russia banned bitcoin. 
hows that working out for them? people still using it. you can't ban it. it's decentralized. As long as the internet is up, it's up.

Its a win win for bitcoin. Cme group and wall st are giving it media attention. Also giving it creedence as a recognized thing in the financial realm. If any body tries to manipulate the market by shorting it,  thats also a good thing. If you try to keep the price down on a rare asset whos numbers are fully accountable, the correction will give people a chance to buy it up. No amount of shorting can keep up with the pure raw demand for bitcoins. Artificially keeping the price down will only cause more buying lol.

At first i asked if there was a monetary  incentive, because i wasnt sure if there was or not, , the replier said no.  Its not comparable to a torrent. By default if you dl a torrent the program automatically seeds at the same time as the dl, so you cant really decide not to seed . you can slow down the upload, but you cant stop it. Having nodes run entirely on the good faith of humanity in my opinion was a huge design flaw from the beginning. If this thing is going to be the future of sending value across the world by billions of people , there needs to be incentives.

Dollar cost averaging is very good for volatile coins with huge price swings. Youll get an average price.  Btc is becoming less volatile with consistant upward trend. If you bought monthly bitcoin this year youd pay more every month. So buying as much as you can at any given point was better.

Bch is not going anywhere tech wise. Increasing the block size to infinity is not a scaling solution. No exchanges will change the default coin to buy alts with to bch. No way in hell. Futures markets are not trading bch. Period. Bitcoin is having a normal healthy correction from a runup from 3500 to 7900. Stop crying. Markets correct. Dont risk rent money, food money,  anything your not willing to loose. Your gambling on a speculative asset.

Ultimately gold cannot be audited. We find new reserves everyday, all over the planet. More important historically the price of gold has been manipulated heavily. Gold ledgers are not immutable. Gold cannot easily be transported across borders without major headaches. Its good to have some physical gold, but we arent going back to the 1600s, 1700s to trade it for commerce. The world is going deeper and deeper into digital era. Owning gold stock , well if were not owning anything physical might as well own bitcoin then lol.

Bitcoin is a revolutionary technology that has a valid use case. It is valued high because it has value. The dotcom bubble, people invested into websites that didnt do anything.

The amount of institutional  money coming in from Korea and Japan alone is crazy. The fact that wall street has derivatives on bitcoin is insane. I cant imagine anybody not thinking this is a big deal lol.  What i mean from most people not being able to own 1 btc is they will never make enough money to buy a full one. How old are you? 
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:16:55
selling and buying , trying to time this market had better odds 3 months ago. 98% of day traders loose their money. Institutional money is pouring in from Ledger X . Hedge funds are starting to play. CME group just announced bitcoin futures trading. new money is coming in hard. the dips are being bought up EXTREMELY fast . They are very short lived now. I wouldn't suggest day trading bitcoin unless you are a very experienced trader with lots of money to play with and loose. your best bet is to just buy and hold. Sell some stuff in anticipation of the fork. If it dips buy more and hold. Im not a financial advisor but in my opinion any loss you take by buying now will only last a few days before its back up again.

Ive been in btc for awhile. We have a runup, then a correction to previous resistance levels. The resistance was a few points in the 5000s, seems to have been testing those levels past few days. Once we gain support and  pass it though, its gone. The only way were getting that far down again is if btc gets hacked . or something much better replaces it. (Highly unlikely)

Fiat currency runs the world currently, anytime someone buys bitcoin their using fiat to do it. If someone is mining and selling bitcoins, they did it with a computer they bought with fiat, using electricity they paid for with fiat. The energy produced was done so by workers getting paid in fiat using equpiment paid in fiat. It all goes back to fiat lol.

when you are "Investing " into bitcoin, your making a speculative gamble on the future of value exchange. Its a trustless ( you don't have to trust a 3rd party with your money) , technology based cryptographically secure asset backed by energy and mathematics vs a corrupted inflationary fiat currency. Your investing in millions of computers around the world keeping track of a decentralized ledger, that is backed by an entire country's worth of electricity , the network is consuming as much energy as the country of iceland. It currently costs a little over 1,000 in energy costs to forge a bitcoin. In the year 2050, 2070, will we be using inflationary fiat currencies that depreciate in value  year after year, or a decentralized nationless, borderless, mathematically sound ledger that cannot be hacked to trade value? keep in mind American USD is 20 trillion in debt and 100 trillion in unfunded liabilities. we're also inflating the money supply daily printing trillions upon trillions in new money to pay interest on our debts. yes, a bubble will POP very soon. But it won't be the bitcoin one. lol People seem to forget bitcoin was CREATED BECAUSE of the 2008 crash.

You pay no taxes on buying and holding. Although there is a record of you buying, there is no record of you selling anything.

Hard forks create a shit coin worth nothing. So not completely similar to money printing. A hard fork is more like creating a fake dollar bill. Yeah you might be able to buy something with it by tricking someone, but its not valuable. Forks are a shit coin that is a copy, that someone might pay you for, and youll get shit money for it toi, because its shit. People sell shit alk day long in the free market. Its still shit.  But it isnt bitcoin lol.  
The govt printing money is like bitcoin core changing the code and the main btc chain increases the coin supply to a couple trillion, devaluing btc. Its completely not the same. Btc is open source and going through growing pains, but it will battle harden. Nothing gets to the top without being attacked and challenged.

Btc has forked twice in the past. They will all be shitcoins with no solid devs. Dont worry about forks. The path will be rocky, but its battle hardening btc. 
It could potentially correct some after the 15th, but in my personal opinion will be short lived. Wall st is playing now. Hedge funds and institutional money is flowing in. Any dips are immediately bought up. Now, is the best time. I remember when i thought bitcoin at 1000 was so fckng much. Now im hoping for a pullback to 6000.  Get in before the herd
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:46:21
Just depends. I think a  500 billion marketcap is pretty reasonable for btc by next years end . hedge funds, institutional money from ledger x and coinbase, media attention. If etfs are approved, and etfs are the big one, thats 1 trillion easy. Because 401ks, retirement accounts, etc, are going to incorporate that etf into their holdings  .

Answer this question, anything you do in cash is a taxable event, how often do you report that to the irs? Anytime you've ever sold anything in your life should have been documented and taxed. Crypto is digital cash. The challenges governments face taxing crypto are the same as taxing cash.  If your employer pays you in btc , monero, whatever, you still get a w2, and you still pay taxes.

Sorry man, im not trying to come off as an ahole. Your points are valid as well. It just seems like someone in the game as long as you should have seen it all by now in terms of fud.. Id say after about 5000 we started getting artificial growth from btcgold fork and segwit2x fork back to back. Everyone trying to get in for that free dividend. We didnt get a chance to correct before another fork happened, then the cme group futures happened and general good news pumped it even further, 100k new coinbase accounts in one day. Going from 3200 to 7900 with no support floor is very volatile in any market. I saw this correcrion coming weeks / month(s) before it occurred and my trades reflect that. In the beginning the koreans did a massive institutional pump , it was over 90% Korean , then more exchanges started jumping in. Im looking at the price now and i cant believe its gone up this much. Its overtaken ethereum. Wow. Just wow. But like anything, what goes up without support levels will come down just as hard. Bch doesnt have a good scaling solution, no devs, etc. It wont last long term. I missed out on that pump tho not gonna lie lol

Massive drops dont happen anymore. Too many people buying the dips. Were starting to go mainstream.  But according to the rsi we are overbought. I think by the 15th we will be pushing close to 8,000 and it will correct down to about 6,000 give or take a few hundred. That would be a good entry point. No matter how optimistic you are no market in the history of man goes up forever green without corrections.

For new investors in the crypto world i would not suggest alt coins. They are higher risk and much more volatile. If you bought btc at every all time high this year  you werent holding the bag for longer than 3 weeks before it surpassed that all time high. If you buy alts at the wrong time you could be bag holding for awhile. 
Some big money is playing, but still early stages. Futures contracts on btc are coming in, as well as institutional money from ledger x. 100 billion marketcap is nothing to the 1%.

Persinally, i dont invest in shit i dont like or dont believe in. Id hope everyone does their due dilligence and researches before putting their hard earned money into something. Bitcoin is still early stages.  
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:52:17
and when it does sort those things out, bitcoin will be worth tens of thousands of dollars. You have to have vision to see into the future. Bitcoin is a speculative gamble on the future of value exchange. Its a trustless, technology based cryptographic asset backed by energy and mathematics vs a corrupted inflationary fiat currency. You choose the future.

Mid 6800s WAS the correction. 6000s are gone bro. Gl buying back in lol. This is the new paradime.  shorting and buying back in at lower prices was okay pre august 2017. Its too risky now to try and time this thing with all the institutional and new money coming in. They are buying up the dips waaay too fast.  I wouldnt suggest trying to short and rebuy unless your very rich with lots of money to loose. 98% of day traders loose their money. Just buy and hold. The sooner the better.

Ive gotten burned in the past. I dont get emotional or attached in this game anymore. I pull out when we're overbought on the rsi. When btc falls the alts fall too so i pull outta those as well.

I never said it wasnt, i was asking if there was a monetary incentive, just like miners get paid in btc. It doesn't really make sense to me to pay miners and not node runners.  One cannot work without the other, yet one has to be done for free. Just doesnt add up . 
@_date: 2017-09-19 21:42:26
Id say anything under 20,000 on a serious correction is a safe bet. Been in crypto awhile now and i think those long bear days are over. Were on the border of mainstream adoption. The amount of fiat flowing into crypto this year alone is more than the entire history of crypto. Its growing exponentially.

Bitcoin network is still not fast enough for daily transactions. It cannot scale like visa currently. In its current form, btc is more akin to digital gold, a digital store of wealth. Waiting 15 minutes at the store for your confirmations is not plausible. Holding your btc still helps the network. If you are fine paying in bitcoin with your pizza instead of becoming a millionaire a couple years later, well thats up to u.

Theoretically thats possible, but you read enough stories about banks not  approving the wire transfer, its just easier to spend it directly via a crypto debit card. The whole point of crypto is to go around the entire central banking infastructure. It will get to a point its no longer worth converting back to dollars, dealing with banks, and it being a deflationary asset and your better off just keeping it in btc. More and more things will accept crypto. Eventually were all just sending crypto back and forth without fiat at all. Crypto will have so much liquidity it will be worse sending your wealth back into fiat. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 18:00:32
It will have minor corrections. Were just at the starting point for going mainstream brotha. 3000s are done. 4000s are done.

Its 2 completely different systems. Fiat currency used to be backed by gold, now its backed by nothing but the u.s. govt. A govt which is 20 trillion in debt thats about to eliminate the debt ceiling. Fiat is an inflationary currency , meaning over time the value of the money becomes less and less. They are printing trillions upon trillions of dollars devaluing the dollar, the central banks failed in 2008, we bailed them out, and continue to bail them out, for breaking the law and committing fraud, upon which nobody is being held accountable, no top bankers went to jail. 
Bitcoin is backed by something. Millions of decentralized computers are backing it. Its a mathematical algorithm that cannot be corrupted, an immutable ledger that cannot double spend or create more than 21 million btc. The bitcoin network is using more energy than iceland. Its primarily backed by electricity, fossil fuels, and the time and capital used for the computers to run the network. 
You have to think big picture. Yes, its good to have gold, but think about the future, an advanced civilization. We aren't going to go back in time to 1700 giving each other shards of gold coins  . we probably aren't going to be using a collapsed debt based fiat currency. In 2050, 2060, 2100, we are most likely going to be using trustless digital currencies with set algorithms and limited supply of said coin, backed by energy (electricity).  
  Tl dr : 
fiat is backed by money printing, corruption, and debt (every new dollar created by the fed is issued as debt)
Btc is backed by math, and electricity.

Nobody knows the future. What I can say is block chain cryptography and decentralized immutable ledgers are not going anywhere and btc has first mover advantage for the moment. If it fails, at least you didnt invest anything you werent willing to loose. This market is speculation and your gambling. Plain and simple. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 10:16:36
Im not a financial advisor.
This is not financial advice. 
Dont invest rent money. 
Dont invest any money your not willing to loose. 
That being said, btc is due to correct. 
It will dip to around 4,000 or so once this bull run is over  .
That would be a good time id get in. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 06:29:19
Well theyve already failed a few times in the last century,  the last being 2008. We already know how this game ends, considering no bankers that are committing fraud and breaking the law are being held accountable. All of the servives you describe can be setup with trust less systems and protocols. This century will be the age of de centralization.  
@_date: 2017-10-28 09:44:35
Data doesnt show that. Too many people and dufferent countries are buying on the dips. Institutional money is now flowing in from ledger x.

I tell them :it is backed by something, and that  its 21st century futuristic thinking. 
- Hundreds of millions of people around the world are supporting  it. 
- Thousands of individuals regardless of nation / race / gender / creed are running the network. 
- its backed by thousands of decentralized computers running the network. 
- most importantly,  its backed by fossil fuels and renewable energy, btc is using as much energy as Iceland. 
- its backed by sound mathematics and cryptography. 
I ultimately tell them this. Fast forward 100 years to 2100. Do you honestly believe we will still be using debt based inflationary fiat currency that has failed multipke times already ? Or progress into the 21st century in the digital and information open source age with a monetary system backed by mathematics and energy?
