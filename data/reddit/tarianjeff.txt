A fair point ScoutHound - but people are getting jacked right off the street. Don't want to hire a private bodyguard as well as purchase all of the above. But wherever one goes there will always be theft. Thanks!

Well said shifty kitten. That stuff scares me. Putting a blockchain based company together now, and would suffer greatly if everything got hacked.

For now. The rest of the article said they are still looking into it.
But yes, if India is not on board, that does not sound good to me either.
