Yes on nicehash you can choose how much of your  gpu/cpu you want to mine with.
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:06:38
1.yes it is easy
2.i forgot the percentage fees, prob around 0.5-1 percent.
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:45:10
Already did, nicehash stops working when i leave it there overnight
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:00:02
So i just download it, let it run, get payed daily?
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:03:53
Yes i know, i just want to leave it mining in the background while i learn about it and such.
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:44:33

@_date: 2017-12-05 03:31:16

@_date: 2017-12-05 03:04:02
What is a fork?
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:27:05
I predict that bitcoin is gonna keep going up for a while, and then slowly decline, and meanwhile litecoin will keep going up.
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:06:07
Like 5 minutes and my computer got to 90°C so uhh... never mining again with a regular desktop

My friends told me to just keep nicehash running in the background, i plan on doing that while learning
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:46:15

@_date: 2017-12-01 02:57:17
I got on nicehash, do i download Amd or nvidia, also how would i connect it to my wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:46:43
Some of my friends live there and told me that they shutdown an entire business or something because of abnormally high electricity use (mining)
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:42:47

@_date: 2017-12-03 21:25:50
So if i buy the 500 dollars of bitcoin on coinbase, how do i send that to a ledger nano s
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:43:28
You cant mine bitcoin there.. or prison
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:35:12
So after doing that i can just hodl for a fuck of a long time, (im 13) And just watch that 500 turn into 1000,2000,3000, then 4000?
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:10:30

@_date: 2017-12-04 03:21:40

@_date: 2017-12-03 05:53:07
What is that?
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:07:27
I wanted to mine litecoin, and asked on their subreddit and they told me you need special equipment
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:52:53
My parents will make me an account and let me invest ~$250 in around 2 months, i havent invested yet lol
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:53:07
I have intel core i7 and my comp is at 86°C should i turn nicehash off?
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:41:54

@_date: 2017-12-01 01:01:03
What is 3x1070
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:00:51
Im too young to make an acc on coinbase or something.. so mining would be my only way to get atleast a little
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:21:26
So i can leave it in coinbase for up to years?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:09:10
When does everyone think it will go up again?
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:27:06
I would say 300k in next 10 years
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:40:39
Thanks man! 
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:57:19

@_date: 2017-11-27 12:17:51
Will we be alive when it hits 1 mill tho?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:43:23
Investing in land is 10x safer in my opinion, but bitcoin will make you 10x more money.
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:37:12
Like $200 worth of it
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:12:24

Im new man xD
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:55:21
Do you have any reccomendations on what/where to read about crypto and different coins and just everything about it?
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:43:06
In otherwords, im renting my software to others and they pay me?
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:40:53
So in the meantime should i just learn more about crypto?
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:48:28
And where would the bitcoin go to?
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:36:12
