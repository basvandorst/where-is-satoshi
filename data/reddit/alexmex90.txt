Out of pure curiosity, what distribution did you tried and what was the process you followed to install the nvidia drivers? 
@_date: 2018-01-03 20:51:35
You are making assertions without any evidence.
@_date: 2018-01-30 16:49:29
I think that was the problem, you're not supposed to follow the manual installation process that nvidia recommends. In Ubuntu there is a prompt called "Additional Drivers" where you can install binaries directly from Ubuntu repositories. This has been a thing since 2010. And like said first you get nouveau drivers and then you can install the nvidia proprietary ones.
In the AMD side... They have a open source driver that works out of the box.

My case against alts is that they are clearly controlled by a single group or person, meanwhile bitcoin was created by Satoshi Nakamoto who gave us the technology and vanished and therefore has no impact in the ecosystem, leaving total control to the community.

Me too, and I was not disappointed.

Well, there is Diaspora, GNU Social, and Mastodon. But no one seems to care.

How is it doing harm to FOSS?

Why is it wrong? Just because it is hard to achieve, should we stop trying to respect people's software freedoms?

No, however it is quite clear that in North Korean society the people have no capability of running for office, request any law change or even protest. So it is a bad example. If you live in a democratic society you have such rights, even if your goal is to remove public property... make your case, back it up with evidence and see where it takes you. But repeating yourself that taxation is theft won't achieve anything, specially if you enjoy of public services.

That's what taxes should be for, always. Taxation is theft when the public budget is bled by corrupt politicians.

Just because Linus doesn't like the license is inherently bad.


Cool, but that's not the point of the GPL. The point of the GPL is keep software in public control. Improvements must be free too so society can benefit of improved software. BSD has been used by companies before, however any improvement that they may have done won't go back and help the project grow, and won't be useful to people.
The freedom "of making proprietary software" is not a freedom, being able to restrict other people's freedom is not a right.

No, because the pool is private property. Meanwhile roads, streetlights, garbage collection are public property, they belong to all citizens. Including yourself. Paying taxes to maintain those services is agreed that is in the best interest of all members of society.
The government is not a bogeyman that is apart from the people, the government is (ideally) the organized administration of the will of the people, if you feel that you government does not represent you you should make your case and run for office.

Even with Linus as dictator, Linux being GPL is enough reason to prefer it over proprietary Windows.

You shouldn't have to pay any taxes if you don't use any public services and properties at all, if you make use of any public services and/or property you should pay taxes. Unless you live away from any trace of civilization, it is not immoral to request taxes from you.

I am in for that as long people self organize for the common good.

Let's change that mentality, let's start working together, united as humans. If we keep working only for personal gains our demise will come sooner. It is difficult, I agree that it sounds utopic, but if we don't pursue that target we will never change.

It has been agreed by society that taxes have to be paid in order to create public infrastructure, if you don't agree you can run for political office, make your case and change this agreement by changing the law, since the law is the contract that binds the people's agreement on the subject. Basically if you're old enough and are using public infrastructure you agreed to be charged taxes, otherwise you may want to move somewhere else (or as I mentioned before, try to change the law).
If a company (what I think you meant instead of companion) built the infrastructure, how that would be funded? wouldn't they charge to use the road? how is that acceptable but paying taxes for public property not? why would it be acceptable to be private property instead?

I would instead push for a government controlled by people instead of controlled by an elite. I don't want the government to disappear, I want it to work for the common man.

I used Bitcoin to buy a Dell laptop otherwise I wouldn't be able to buy it because I don't have a US credit/debit card. 
I think it is a success for me.
