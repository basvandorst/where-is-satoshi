Solved.  
@_date: 2014-07-10 01:40:44
I didn't know about that.  I'll do it tonight!
@_date: 2014-01-14 18:20:59
We're actually ok with that.  It's probably the slowest and most tedious way to make money on the site, but you're welcome to do it.

They were taken at different times.

Here are a few videos of stock delimited M5s over 200mph.
You're right about the bike, though.  It's only good for around 190mph stock.  Thankfully, mine's not stock  :)

Don't tempt me...  ;)
@_date: 2014-07-10 01:40:30
Today could be the day  :)
@_date: 2013-05-12 19:02:01
Yea - the hint and the text in the cryptobin seem redundant...
And I'm not sure if that random Cap is a typo or not...
@_date: 2013-05-09 23:21:49
The zeroes are weird, though.  And there is one instance of a double-zero...
@_date: 2013-05-10 00:58:02
But between buy and sell, all you need to do is move BTC from one exchange to the other.  
It doesn't matter how long it takes to get your USD out of Gox and back into BTC-e...
@_date: 2013-05-10 18:21:55
You guys are killing me  :)
Now that it's over, can someone at least explain how you get words from the numbers?
@_date: 2013-05-08 20:18:46
Ugh.  Just need the last password for cryptobin
@_date: 2013-05-08 21:23:22
Yea.  I actually figured out the last password with just hint   I'm guessing that hint  helped out the person who won the money.
@_date: 2013-12-08 17:10:50
Please go treat your private keys as if they were worth a small fortune.  Because they are.
Put the btc in cold storage using distributed keys generated with a secure computer.  Print the keys and put them in a few physically secure places.
@_date: 2013-05-09 21:22:41
Man.  I can't even get the first piece...
@_date: 2013-05-16 23:19:39
Are there going to be hints for the post-chest stuff?  
@_date: 2013-05-08 20:29:17
I wish I had paid attention in art class...
@_date: 2013-05-17 01:39:50
@_date: 2013-05-17 01:32:03
Still cant get it to work though.  Fab1anFab1an - I'll send you the key I think it should be in pm
@_date: 2013-05-17 00:15:44
I mean it would be helpful to know which hint (if any) applies to the image inside the chest 5 box, which hint (if any) applies to the riddle in the chest 6 box (though I don't think that needs one), and which hint applies to the "Golden Key hidden layer" riddle (where I'm stuck)
@_date: 2013-05-09 21:37:47
Phone, computer, website, screen, monitor.  
Sigh.  I'll try again on the next one.
Weird because I was all over yesterday's puzzle.  This one just doesn't jive with my brain or something!
@_date: 2013-05-08 21:44:50
I figured out Halley by finding the artwork by Giotto.  I found it was called Adoration of the Magi, but Giotto's work was unique in that it displayed the Star of Bethlehem as a comet.  People theorize that he did so based on seeing Halley's comet.  That made me guess Halley.
@_date: 2013-05-08 21:14:08
I feel ya.  All-consuming!
I know what it is, but can't figure out the right phrasing for the final password!
@_date: 2013-05-10 18:45:11
I feel so dense, because I still don't get it.  :(
I tried that a bunch of times yesterday, then gave up because the number values don't exist in the musical notes...
Which note, for example, is 181760?  What does the whole thing spell?
@_date: 2013-05-11 04:19:02
Man.  These keep getting tougher.  I did great on the egypt one.  These last two are brutal.
I think that the answer to the first one should be Sally Ride, or Challenger or something.  "been on this RIDE".  Space Theme.  She was 35 when the Challenger exploded.  
But it's not  ;)
@_date: 2013-05-10 19:06:20
Now I get it.
I thought the dots were separators.
@_date: 2013-05-08 21:19:27
Really great last hint.  Wow.
@_date: 2013-05-12 22:37:38
This was the worst return on my time I've ever seen.  Hours and hours of frustration, pain, and neglecting my kids.  All for just $15 USD.  
And it's honestly one of the very few emails I look forward to every single day.  Such an awesome concept, and the execution is flawless.  The puzzles are great, and I CANNOT wait for the next one!
Thanks, Fab1anFab1an.

Obvious?  First try?  Ugh.  Frustrating.  I have no idea on the first clue...
@_date: 2013-05-16 17:34:37
You just use the MtGox trade api to make your trades.  
It's not sketchy.  It just hides your intent until you make the trade.  It's not any different than putting in market orders;  it's just done automatically using the API.
@_date: 2013-05-16 23:37:09
Golden Key?!?!?!
@_date: 2013-05-12 18:22:38
Seriously.  This is supposed to be fun, and you're taking all of the fun out of it...
@_date: 2013-05-09 23:01:01
I love the beep on hints.  I wish the 8th hint would help with the second cryptobin or the numbers or the zip password!
@_date: 2013-05-16 21:58:36
Read the FAQ on the main page.  It tells you how to extract the bitcoins once you solve the riddle.
@_date: 2013-05-12 20:18:01
Helpful to know which hint goes with which bin. Thanks.
Stuck on 6.  Lots of clever answers, but none work.  I'm thinking it's a different "subject"...
@_date: 2013-05-12 22:21:31
Got it!
@_date: 2013-05-17 00:51:41
Chest 1
Chest 2
Chest 3
"greek" (sure this is the messed up part)
"golden key"
Is that right?
@_date: 2013-05-12 21:57:05
Just to make sure I have the order correct, the sixth bin cryptotext starts with nQEhlp, right?
Fifth starts with ogODs?
Fourth starts with rwIAf?
@_date: 2013-05-12 22:29:24
Finished.  Man, the adrenaline was PUMPING at the end.
I left about half the bounty in the account for 
@_date: 2013-05-17 00:34:48
Psi and Theta are the stumbling blocks...
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:29:58
...and it takes 4-10 days before you get your bitcoins, at a rate that may look nothing like the one you see today.
@_date: 2013-05-08 21:28:12
I'll let the winner explain the entire thing.  Part of the honor of winning, yea?
@_date: 2013-05-09 23:09:06
What I know so far about the numbers:
They aren't ipv6 addresses (thought maybe the old/new ones hint was about IP)
Moving them to hex doesn't seem to help.
They don't seem to be anything frequency related (what's the frequency kenneth?);  at least not related to musical notes, or DTMF tones.
There are 12 numbers.  Some are 3 in length, some 5, and some 6.  Some of the length 5 numbers have leading 0s, which makes them interestingly different than the length 3 numbers.  Leading zeroes are apparently important.
There are also 12 songs on the album.
@_date: 2013-05-13 22:08:10
Ignore that it says anything about treasure.  Forget aout treasures.
Read it this way:
Here are a list of four elements.  One is missing.  What is missing from the list?
Answer:  The Fifth Element.
One other hint that it's an element is that the treasure names are element names as well:  Holy Grail - Hg - Mercury.
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:31:02
I'm in the US and couldn't get verified on Kraken because they don't support US customers yet...
@_date: 2013-05-12 21:44:25
I think I'm more confused now  :)
It's so cool when a breakthrough occurs, though :)
@_date: 2013-05-08 21:23:58
Good work!
Did you figure out Halley from hint 4 or 5?
@_date: 2013-05-10 15:08:03
Two hunters are out in the woods when one of them collapses. He doesn't seem to be breathing and his eyes are glazed. The other guy whips out his phone and calls the emergency services. He gasps, "My friend is dead! What can I do?" The operator says "Calm down. I can help. First, let's make sure he's dead." There is a silence, then a gun shot is heard. Back on the phone, the guy says "OK, now what?"
@_date: 2013-05-12 23:06:09
It looks like the account is empty.  Here is the solution:
1)  Cryptobin from the start page:  
Clue   Which creature walks on four legs in the morning, two legs in the afternoon, and three legs in the evening?
Clue   There are two sisters: one gives birth to the other and she, in turn, gives birth to the first. Who are the two sisters?
Hint   They had to answer this riddle to gain entrance
The two clues are different versions of "The Riddle of the Sphinx".  
2)  Cryptobin:   
The image at  contains greek characters that translate to latin characters and say "I WILL GRANT YOU ACCESS TO MY SECRET".  That's a red herring, though.  The way to get to the answer is:
Hint   Beneath the guardian
Underneath the Sphinx is rumored to be the "Hall of Records"
3) Cryptobin:   
This one hung me up for a while.  You're not looking for a missing treasure.  The keyword that got me moving was in the text.  lost ELEMENTS of history.  
Hint   You can count the treasures on 1 hand
What's missing is "The Fifth Element" of history.
4) cryptobin:   
Easy.  I am also the fifth element.
Hint   Atomic number.
Answer:  "Boron"
5)  cryptobin:   
Hint   It is pure.
This one took me forever.  It was finally Fab1anFab1an's hint that "I" referred to Carbon.  Even after that, it took a while to go through the possibilities.  Carbon Nanotubes, Carbon fiber, Diamonds, man made diamonds, buckyball, graphite, then finally, "Graphene"
6)   
Hint   Too much is unhealthy.
What do redditors like that isn't healthy en masse?  "Bacon"!
7)  Cryptobin  
You get a backwards half of the key here.  
Hint   Follow the capitals.  
Go through all of the other hints and look for oddly capped letters.  They spell DEFEAT.  For you it is the opposite.  "Victory".
That gives you the other half of the key.
Not really sure what Hint 8 if for:  There is more to the opposite
Awesome puzzle!
@_date: 2013-05-08 21:27:37
Fab1anFab1an:  You're *awesome* for doing this.  Thanks so much!
@_date: 2013-05-09 23:44:33
No.  I'm about to give up on the numbers.  I've tried everything I can think of.
@_date: 2013-05-12 22:32:48
There's still money in the account!  Keep going!
@_date: 2013-05-09 23:30:38
Nice.  Hopefully the next steps aren't as crazy!
@_date: 2013-05-12 17:57:27
Hah.  Nice touch with the HTML pages that say, "No"
@_date: 2013-05-17 02:54:04
So fricken clever.  Good job figuring it out, even though the wallet was empty.  Was the adrenaline pumping when you started to add the private key to the wallet?  ;)
I saw the tablet order earlier, but forgot it by the time I got back to the tablet part!  Argh!
Fab1anFab1an:  You're the man!
@_date: 2013-05-08 20:13:12
Weird that it's not split exactly in half...
@_date: 2013-05-08 21:18:54
ARGH!  Someone got it just before me!
@_date: 2013-05-12 19:42:37
Hard to tell which hint goes with which cryptobin...Especially after the three or four "easy" ones...
@_date: 2013-05-16 23:50:00
Can you share which hints post-chest go with sub-hint 5, sub-hint 6a, and sub-hint 6b?
Miss applying hints because they're the wrong number is harsh  :)
@_date: 2013-05-08 20:42:18
One more hint!!!  Or a higher resolution scan!
@_date: 2013-05-10 00:35:40
Nice work!  Can someone explain the answer, or at least the numbers portion?
@_date: 2013-05-09 23:09:59
Some are prime, but not all.
decimal to ascii isn't interesting.
@_date: 2013-05-16 23:12:19
Argh.  Need the last 13 for the key!
@_date: 2013-05-09 23:31:30
Hex seems the closest interesting thing.  It's 192 bytes, or 48 hex characters.  
@_date: 2013-05-17 00:43:18
Argh.  I tried all combinations I could think of for psi and theta.  I give up.
@_date: 2013-05-12 21:03:05
It's likely none of the things you guys are thinking about.  Once I figured it out, I KNEW I got it.  And it's "clever".
@_date: 2013-05-08 21:04:00
Keep trying.  It's fun when you start to figure it out!
@_date: 2013-05-16 23:32:21
Brute force 13 characters?  I wish I had your server farm!
