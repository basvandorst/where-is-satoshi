It's good that she's interested in it.  Many bitcoin were lost in the early days giving family/random people Bitcoin who would just throw it away or lose the paper wallet.

sometimes it takes a gut kick like this to really show you what is important.  Welcome back dude, keep hodling until we get to a million+ per coin.

I think it's a good idea to get them now if you don't have any and are able to hodl for 20 years.  Get yourself a hardware wallet too.

nah it's normal, we all have heart attacks testing out bitcoin and crypto for the first time.  You'll probably have mini heart attacks which will decrease in severity as the years go on and you get more experience and start to trust the system.

if you set up your own 24 words then you should be fine, no guarantees but I doubt they are pre-hacking them, just setting up seeds for unsuspecting victims.  If you set up your own seed words then I would assume you should be fine.

yeah but we shouldn't give up on Ross either way.  He's being basically slaughtered for helping us all see the potential of Bitcoin and if you don't think he did, the earliest real news about Bitcoin was about his work and that news report increased the real world usecase for bitcoin regardless of if you like the subject or not.   It gave bitcoin a value in the real world for something people really fucking wanted.  
this news report by abc was literally the first video that brought Bitcoin to the mainstream  after this news report the popularity of bitcoin actually exploded.

I just updated the firmware on a couple of ledgers this week.  the new process is very good and very easy.  I'm sure the answer is never 100% safe but a thief would probably have better chance stealing your bitcoin with a wrench than hacking your computer and they would probably have to know you had a ledger to target you in RL.  As long as you don't use your computer for stuff that you might get viruses or share a computer with kids I would feel pretty safe.

The problem though is that most of these machines are owned by small businesses and they generally will have at least a 15-25% markup which is not like crazy in business but they don't operate at a scale that makes it reasonable to begin charging a lot less.  When your bank lets you exchange bitcoin for cash then they can give you 1% fee or sign up with gemini if you need cheap fees or whatever but Joe Bitcoin who bought the machine to help adoption while making a little side profit can't afford to scale like that.  Don't forget that most of these BTM are also sharing profits with the store owner for space if not outright owned by the small store itself.

Well, I guess it would be nice
If I could touch your bitcoin
I know not any blockchain
That's got a candle like you
Oh, but I gotta think twice
Before I give my bits away
And I know all the games you play
Because I'm a whale too
Oh, but I need some time off from that emotion
Time to pick my ass up off the floor
Oh, when that price comes down without deflation
Well, it takes a strong hand, baby
But I'm showin' you the floor
Cause you gotta have faaaaaaaith
Get the F up!

This is being overly cautious.  I've worn a lot of bitcoin shirts since 2011 and nobody has ever attacked me.

TCP came out in 1974 and I bet you didn't even know what the internet was until 1995 more than 10 years after the word internet was invented and you probably thought AOL was the internet.  The internet didn't even get big until years later when shit like skype and and shit around 2003.  The internets killer apps didn't even get into their own groove until like 30 years after the advent of the internet and we're like at year 10 of blockchain.  slow your roll there young pup.  Owning a full bitcoin today is like owning a 3 letter prime domain in the 80s.
