Give me some? :(
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:49:41
Then please explain the monetary system in the US.
@_date: 2013-04-11 10:03:55
What if it's mtgox that is making the 0.02 btc trades.... 
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:42:08
I did, it's bloody depressing. It'll go back up tomorrow though, today will separate the boys from the men! 
@_date: 2013-04-11 10:53:47
Lol no one can manipulate bitcoin except bots and mtgox.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:08:15
If you want to mine with a GPU start mining litecoin. Just google, there's plenty of resources out there.

This have me a good chuckle. Thanks for brightening up my day :)
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:47:37
You've just described what happened to me, I'm glad there's other people in the same situations. Hang in there :)
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:01:24
Can't tell if you're being serious. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:12:42
If the botters are controlled by speculators with a lot of cash they could afford the fee and it would instead hurt the casual trader. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:02:59
I've noticed there aren't any 0.02 trades on other exchanges, would getting rid of the API on mtgox discourage botting ?
@_date: 2013-04-11 09:32:27
We rely too much on mtgox.
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:32:06
So why are people still using them even though they know people panic when it lags?
@_date: 2013-04-11 09:18:14
It was obvious this was a coordinated crash. Just look at the data, small sell offs and lag due to ddos caused the panic. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:31:02
@_date: 2013-04-02 18:46:05
Wow that's quite risky.
@_date: 2013-04-14 20:21:50
It's because the volume being traded at campbx is small and mtgox is infested with bots. You can tell which ones are the bots when you're watching the data. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:08:51
mtgox is now crashing from the lag, so much market manipulation it's crazy
@_date: 2013-11-05 20:10:06
It's going down like a champ
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:46:42
This is the aftermath of the DDoS. They are behind in trades which is why there's a lag. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:10:43
Depends on where you are but bitstamp is awesome. 
@_date: 2013-04-14 22:28:33
This is how they lag the system, it didn't work this time since gox installed more hardware to hold the system together. You can see in the order book 50 BTC was moved and bought at the same time at those prices. The amount in usd decreased from $0.0017 to $0.0016 and so on.... 
@_date: 2013-04-11 10:46:47
Transferwise and bitstamp.
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:17:28
Can we please just admit that it is all because of mtgox getting ddos'ed and not due to their "success".
@_date: 2013-04-11 09:39:00
Of course they do because they would lose business
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:19:25
If only they could somehow sell them slowly and then invest in infrastructure &amp; health care :/
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:16:42
Today was the initiation of true investors. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:04:31
@_date: 2013-04-11 10:45:41
Biggest threat to bitcoin? mtgox
@_date: 2013-04-13 21:09:15
Small trades are propping up the price to create a trap. 
@_date: 2013-03-23 17:47:57
The most important aspect is the fact that fiat is not backed by gold or silver. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:49:15
I must have bought some from you at that price :( Enjoy my money
