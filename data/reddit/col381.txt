You (and anyone with any sizeable bitcoin holding) should most definitely invest the time to put their coins in a ‘cold’ storage device such as a paper wallet, or a hardware wallet.
The nice thing about both of these is that you can (a) password protect the wallets, and (b) make multiple backups. Even if one copy gets stolen, the thieves would also need your password.

Look at that tiny little MtGox peak. Soon you won’t even be able to see it on the “all time history” price  graphs, but for years that bastard was a huge peak of past achievement hanging over us all like a shadow of failure. Then $1k came again and that peak was just a memory and in a flash it’s gone to $10k already and it’s all barely just begun. 
The network effect is kicking in, Bitcoin is getting more popular every day worldwide and the more people want it the more it is worth. The more it is worth the more desirable it becomes and the more useful it becomes for big business. Once they start using it to move their millions around, I predict sooner than we will all believe, and the price is just as likely to be $50k, $100k and before we know it, it will be worth $1 million a coin, $10 million, or much more. 
Or something will go wrong and it will all be worth nothing. 
One or the other.

Any company with serious money can build their own internet as well, but good luck getting anyone who will want to connect to it, let alone completely trust it.
The true power of bitcoin is the ten of thousands of nodes and miners that secure it. The very fact that no one can control it and that there is no need to trust anyone else with your money - no private company can compete with that. 
Take Ripple for example - if that company goes bust, everyone in the entire system loses all of their money. Half the bitcoin companies in the world could go bust tomorrow and bitcoin will be just as secure and as safe as it has ever been.
@_date: 2015-06-01 05:20:25
As I understand it, the problem is orphan blocks (which occur when two miners find a block at the same time- It happens from time to time). In order to allow quicker block times you need to reduce the difficulty to make the blocks much easier to find, but that in turn increases exponentially the likelihood of orphans occurring.

@_date: 2015-06-12 05:29:33
Too wishy washy, what happens if transactions grow too fast for blocksize to keep up or not enough in line with the growth? Fees are all good and fine but if it all goes wrong and fees or transactions get too high there is no easy way out.
In my mind either the size is determined by an algorithm based on average transaction size (which leads to the problem of possible unrestricted growth and restricts the ability for fees to rise), or the value is taken out of the code entirely and put into the blockchain so it can be changed 'on the fly' as needs arise via a (X of Y) multisig based voting mechanism.
@_date: 2015-06-11 13:00:12
Block reward is currently worth thousands, fees are usually a few dollars but cost the block finder valuable seconds to stake their claim on the block lest it be declared an orphan. Some miners choose to abandon the fees totally in favour of greater security of getting the block rewards.

The major thing that always struck me as really strange about the allegations was the payment he is suppsed to have sent - [was sent using a regular wire transfer](
That just smells fishy. He used Bitcoins for everything else he did, the vast bulk of his wealth was bitcoins - yet he used an easily traceable and completely open money transfer to send money for a hit.
Not saying either way whether he did or didn't do this - but this part of the story does not seem to add up at all. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 03:13:01
I think this is right: They miss out on the extra transaction fees they might have had, but get the benefit that they can publish a found block slightly sooner lest someone orphan it away from them. As transactions go up and block rewards go down in a few years, this will become harder for them to do because they will need those transactions fees to survive.

Here's an idea - As far as the giving coins to folks, how about giving them to only 1/3 of the group and then getting those 10 folks to forward the coins (or part of them) on to the others in the group and so on - that way folks will get to experience both receiving and sending coins, and it will make it a faster exercise for you rather than you frantically trying to send out 30 payments in a row to everyone in the room by yourself. Would make it more fun also. Do this as the very last thing you do in your presentation so folks don't get sidetracked.
Also - don't focus on Satoshi much (he is not really relevant anymore into where BTC is going in the future, a brief mention is good enough) and don't even mention the dark market side of things unless you have to, it just puts people off (if folks bring it up in questions remind them that dollars are the the  currency for drugs and weapons worldwide by a massive margin); instead concentrate on the 'World Wide Ledger' parts and how bitcoin is just a part of a much bigger universe of opportunity.

Law Enforcement. 
Coinbase would not know the address is a DNM one, but we can safely assume (in my opinion) that they share the details of all bitcoin addresses they send to with the cops and they do they rest. Of course they have verified personal details for all their accounts so for every coin you buy and transfer out to a wallet they can match a name to each and every bitcoin address they deal with. 
Now assume that the cops have managed to either infiltrate or capture a DNM and have their transaction logs (eg. they managed to capture the entire Silk Road server for example). Now they have a list of addresses used by the DNM. Using the [blockchain]( if they can trace Bitcoin transactions back from the DNM addresses to the individual person that purchased those coins, they have evidence you may have done something illegal, but can't prove what (or if) you did. 
To see an example of this, a similar process was used recently as evidence in the Silk Road corruption case, they had the two end addresses, it was [just a matter of connecting the dots in the middle](

So true this statement from the Q&amp;A; 


Answer: When we talk to banks, when we talk about bitcoin, they want to stay away from it. We don’t use bitcoin, we use the blockchain. And we don’t use it just to say that we use the blockchain. It allows us to avoid being a trusted third-party.
Swap 'bitcoin' with 'email', and 'blockchain' with 'internet' and you get an idea of how short sighted the banks are being by automatically discounting anything related to bitcoin. "We couldn't possibly do anything over the internet" is basically their response and in that light you can immediately see why they are being so stupid by automatically dismissing away bitcoin related technology. 
The blockchain is not just about bitcoin. More properly it should be seen as really no different to a 'second layer' of the internet that runs on it's own separate servers. Just like internet was back in the mid 90's, before it really took off with business and the general public - it may not have widespread public use just yet, but the base infrastructure is in place and the potential of its power is just waiting to be exploited.  
@_date: 2015-05-13 22:43:36
So much wrong with this. First of all the monetary amount they need for coloured coins can be any value at all, just a few satoshis is enough so just one or two coins would be enough to register millions of  shares. Somehow I don't think NASDAQ are going to baulk at having to buy a few hundred dollars worth of bitcoin.
Second if they wanted a private ledger they they would install MS-SQL and start a web page, but that is precisely not what they want at all. They want something publicly and independently verifiable: without the need for private servers, private networks, or most importantly third party trust - and the blockchain is by far the most secure (secure because of it's sheer size and number of nodes/miners, secure because unlike private systems it cannot be hacked, secure because the high price and much larger adoption of bitcoin gives it far greater potential long term survival prospects). I think you are really missing the point of why they are using a blockchain in the first place.

So it's about an hour and a half since the test - but the unconfirmed tx size is still at around 23,000 txs and hasn't really been going down. If anything it's going up.
Why aren't these TXs getting cleared? Shouldn't they be getting included in the blocks as they are found (up to the 1mb limit of course) - so why are most of the blocksizes still sitting at the ~700k mark?
Is this simply a case of the top mining pools not including most of the txs that were sent? If so - how are these transactions going to clear?

When purchasing from an exchange, ANY exchange, you should automatically assume that your transactions will be known and will be traceable by the government. 
If you want to go spending your coins where they shouldn't be, then you need to take steps to ensure that a direct line cannot be drawn from your personal account where you bought the coins to the dodgy place they ended up.
The Blockchain doesn't forget, and it is all too easy to connect the dots if you have the start and end points. [Case in point](

Anyway here are my suggestions for you to make it better; Hope these are useful to you. 
- A QR code scanner button for the address field
- You have nowhere on the site that I can see to browse through available channels, search, see popular streams currently in action, featured streams, upcoming 'shows' etc. You really need something like this to build your community. 
- A still frame (or time limited) preview feature for each channel (where the broadcaster has allowed it). 
- An 'ABOUT' area where the broadcaster can list rules, details about the stream, etc.
- Account setup/ stream name reservation (maybe use Namecoin or something similar to register names to allow popular channel names to be exchanged/sold in the future)
- A similar function that allows a shared teamviewer/vnc style desktop session instead/as well as a video stream (i.e. to allow remote support assistance etc.) would be an excellent enhancement. would be great for tutors etc.
- A group chat area for each channel (maybe for extra btc?)
- Does it do two way VoIP as well? I couldn't tell. It needs the ability to communicate. (maybe for extra Btc?)

The real question that you aren't asking is *can* a government enforce such a blacklist? On individual exchanges, sure, they could try - it would succeed in making the lives of those exchanges hell since over time just about every coin would gather some sort of taint to it eventually. 
But to try imposing such rules on the entire bitcoin community, on personal wallets, p2p transactions and throughout all the exchanges worldwide - not a chance in hell. Not unless the community want such a thing - which I cannot ever see happening.
 
All such a scheme would do is make life shit for that countries' exchanges and bitcoin would happily continue to do what it does throughout the rest of the world.

First the users of this system are not '70 companies', the users are the tens of thousands of individual share holders of those companies who matter here, but let's say there the 70 companies represent the minimum number of private blockchain full nodes that run for this private network of yours. There are currently 1.5 million nodes on the blockchain doing verification and checking of transactions, which of these two networks is going to be the most secure and trustworthy for the public users of this service?    
Your fallacy is that you seem to think that a small privately controlled blockchain is somehow going to be more secure than a publicly controlled one, and that is the inherent weakness of your model - you are relying on trusting a small number of third parties. Yet it is the vastly larger number of users, miners, verification nodes, and the public transparency of everything about the blockchain that makes it (far) more secure, not less.

I think you are right. 
If I am guessing correctly they might be thinking a 'Mesh' style internet connection sharing mechanism that uses bitcoin to make micro-payments to an IOT enabled router. People's routers at home would essentially resell their internet traffic to strangers, with 21 taking a large cut of the money received. It would mean mobile phones could make cheaper and lower power voice and data connections by accessing smaller local wifi style cells wherever they went, and could avoid larger charges by avoiding the 3g/4g networks as much as possible. I guess the pay off for the router owner would be that they collect their cut of the fees collected into the IOT wallet.
Seems like this could be something if they get the price metrics right, 3g/4g data is extremely expensive so it might work. This definitely sounds more sensible than the 'miner in a toaster' nonsense.

If you don't think that ~every~ online exchange based in the US, UK, Canada, Aus, etc. all pass every bit of data about the transactions they process with you to the government then you are extremely naive at best. These companies all have to deal with the current financial system to survive, they all have to toe the line and that means sharing all of your data and history. They already track all of your fiat transactions from the banks, why wouldn't they want to do it (as much as they can) with bitcoin?
Quite frankly I am surprised anybody is surprised by this. Did we all learn nothing from Ed Snowden's revelations? Is anybody actually surprised that all the 'five eyes' are each now independently passing laws to make the illegality of the warrantless spying they have been doing (that the 5 eyes arrangement got around) simply go away? 
Total government surveillance (particularly of financial transactions) is not conspiracy theory any more, Ed Snowden showed us that it is already here and it shows no sign soon of ever going away.

Or they seem to think they can just go off and build their own blockchain, not appreciating that the sheer massive size of the Bitcoin miner network is the inherent safety feature that makes it as secure as it is. No private network could ever properly compete (for less than a few billion dollars worth of servers that is), and then you have all the problems of running costs, security, etc. The beauty of the WWL is that all comes already complete.

There is a public/wallet address, and there is a private key that matches that address. You send coins to the public address, you spend them with the private key.
When you got your refund, did they ask you an address to send the coins back to?, or did they refund to the originating address you send from? 
If the first, if you don't have the private key that matches to the public address, those coins are lost. If the last, then you must have the key since you would have needed it to spend it in the first place.

I got into Bitcoin in early 2015.
If you look at the price charts today everyone is immediately drawn to that big ATH price spike of 2017, prices over $20,000, it was a crazy time. And it makes you wonder, will Bitcoin prices ever reach such highs again?
What makes me smile is remembering that back in early 2015 and the years that followed the price charts looked very similar. There was this big spike that dominated the price chart, that towered over us all. It too was from when the price went nuts but then the MtGox crash sent the price tumbling, and all through 2015-16 as the long winter of the bear whale progressed everyone was wondering...   will we ever reach such highs again? That spike back then was just over $1,000.
Today that ‘huge spike’ that dominated us all for years, if you look at the charts today you can hardly even see it. In comparison it is now just a tiny little bump that you wouldn’t even notice if you didn’t know what it meant for so long. I feel confident in time that the $20k spike of today too will just disappear into an insignificant bump that no one would notice if you didn’t know what it was.

Here is my take on what is really going on: - it is the small blockers that are forcing change on the network, not the big blockers. 
Big blockers are simply trying to make sure that in a few years time BTC can continue to operate as it does today. By allowing blocks increased capacity this will provide more space to process more transactions per block. Just like today there will be lots of room for transactions in each block because BIP101 as implemented by XT will allow the blocks to grow over time if they need to. In this design everyone will get their transactions processed in the next 10min block just like happens right now. 
Now the small blockers on the other hand are really the ones actually trying to force fundamental changes to the network. They *want* the blocks to remain small forever because they want to turn the available space in each block into a commodity that will drive a future fees market. They believe that if they artificially restrict the space that is available for transactions, this will in turn force bitcoin users to pay higher fees. Those high fees will over time drive a secondary market of bitcoin transaction "middlemen" companies who will sidestep these fees by collating lots of smaller transactions together offchain using the "lightning network" solution. These middlemen companies will end up providing for the bulk of transactions for bitcoin. So the plan is that we all pay lower fees to lightning providers, who will collate their transactions as much as they can and then pay the high fees to the miners  to issue transaction over the core part of the network. In this scenario the network as a result scales hugely dues to all the lighting providers, the miners are happy because the fees are high, and an addition lightning layer gets to also make money by offloading transactions.
Both sides want miners to continue mining to support the network. Both agree that fee amounts paid per block processes need to increase in order to provide a greater income for the miners, so it continues to be profitable for them to run when the coming reward halving occurs next year. 
Big Blockers want to drive up the fees by allowing more small fee transactions to occur per block. 
Small blockers want to limit how many "core" transactions can occur so they can drive up fees for writing to the blockchain, and at the same time drive the creation of a secondary lighting provider network.
Big Blockers also want lightning, but believe that since it doesn't yet exist that we need to act now to avoiding any chance of future lockups if transactions grow too large for the system to cope.      
@_date: 2015-08-17 13:57:12
You can hardly say they are rushing things, the debate about block size has been going on ever since the limit was first created. The imperative to do something now is simply recognition (by pretty much everybody on both sides of the debate) that as bitcoin grows it *will* need to be increased in the next 1-2 years.
Gavin and Mike are simply arguing that in order to secure the future of the network, we need to get the change in place *now* so it isn't causing problems down the track when block sizes start to exceed 1mb.

It’s all too easy for these whales to make the price go down, near impossible for them to make the price go up. 
So they sell a load at once and try to get the price to tank, then buy back everything at a discount once it’s down enough. Then in a few months the halving brings everything back to at least where were yesterday and hopefully beyond. 
The best way to beat them is not play their game, don’t join the panic, don’t sell, buy while the prices are cheap. Easier said than done though...

I find it ironic that those supporting the creation of a international BTC settlement network, are all essentially hoping somehow that the banks are going to step in, invest massively and everything will be fine . Let's face it, these are the ONLY folks who will be using this hypothetical settlement network, so really this scenario is the only way this might ever happen. And the chances of that happening right now are close to ZERO.  
Why the fuck should they? If you were a bank, why not just use ripple, citi-coin or whatever the fuck it will be called, or some other alt coin, why possible benefit would BTC be to a bank? Do they think that BTC has a higher value will be the golden egg? Then how do they think the massive high value needed for multi billion $ transactions transfers is going to arise in the first place? 
The only thing that will allow bitcoin to grow to the point where it will have high enough value to become the settlement device these folks want to see it become is if it is used wildly as a currency first by lots of people. Only when BTC becomes the international currency of choice will it become the international settlement method of choice. Not before. Bitcoin can become both a currency and a settlement network, but it will never be one or the other unless it is both and to be both it needs to be a currency first and foremost.

That was my thought behind averaging the numbers in the calculation over the last 90 days, my thinking is that this would reduce the impact of spam transactions by hugely increasing the work a spammer would need to do in order to pull off an attack. When averaged over a much longer time, the stats of the rest of the network would effectively drown the effect of a spam attack out. 
It would not 100% stop the spamming problem, but it would significantly increase the resources that an attacker would need to cause a damaging effect on the system.

I think you are right, and ironically it is Bitcoin &amp; the Blockchain that have shown governments the solution to their problem (one that doesn't involve a nation having to rely on Visa or Mastercard to digitize all transactions). 
I would expect to see "bitcoin like" national currencies start to emerge in the next 5-10 years. I.e. not BTC, but national digital currencies setup similar to Ripple that work the same way as bitcoin but still keep a central control of the currency (and of course are still inflationary in nature).

If any dynamic indicator was going to be used it should be something like the number of transactions the network gets. This would keep the blocksize at the minimum it needs to be, but would still allow it to grow naturally as traffic increases over time. Something like..

There is a balance between the two extremes though; a) either BTC transactions in the future will be a handful of high fee, high value transactions; or b) a large number of low fee transactions. Both scenarios offer incentives for miners as both would offer fees sufficient for them to make money but both depend on entirely different things. A) depends on transactions being large value in order to justify the high fees, &amp; B) depends on widespread use and essentially public adoption.    
IMO the A scenario simply cannot come about without B happening first, and for B to happen first blockchain needs to be able to accept low value transactions and low fees.

You have to be at least in your 40s and have been around at the time when the internet was in its infancy to really appreciate this, but it is so true. 
It was back when the internet was basically just basic HTML documents and nothing else, in the years before Youtube and all the things we use today, when it was essentially just a way to view documents digitally - and boy were there were a lot of naysayers. 
*"The Internet will never take off, once people get bored with just reading web pages they will just stop using it"* - This is exactly the sort of thing people 'in the know' said at the time.   
At the time is was basically a simple "digital library" only, the only other applications were email and news services which were basic as fuck, and it was definitely geek only. And then interesting things like the coffee pot web cam started, and then web cams in general just took off and from there Youtube started up, and Amazon, and eBay, and online porn became a thing and from there internet just took off like wildfire. It was an amazing time. 
Digital currency now is right where the internet back then was, it is so basic right now, and it has so much potential yet to fulfill. Like the internet it might take a few years before it takes off but I can't wait to see where this thing goes.

- Paper wallets can be created &amp;amp; printed 100% offline, (infact they ALWAYS should be). 
- Trezors can be stolen, smashed, or damaged by water, fire, electricity or magenetism.  Paper wallets can also be stolen or damaged but are much easier to protect, and much easier to create multiple secure backups (by simply printing multiple copies of your wallets for storage at disparate sites). 
- Paper wallets can be encoded with BIP38 so even if stolen will not release the coins, same basic level of security as Trezor offers, but paper wallets cost about a cent each to make your own, Trezor - not so cheap. 
- [Trezors can be hacked.]( or have corrupted firmware. A paper wallet can never be hacked.
- Paper wallets can be copied to create offsite backups, and for extra security printed on waterproof, heat resistant paper, and stored in fireproof storage containers. 
Paper wallets win for me.

I think you are missing the point of what OP is requesting here. 


Damn right paper wallets are bad for this, you should only ever withdraw from the paper wallet once - a full sweep. But we are talking **storage** here - you wouldn't keep $200k in fiat in your wallet, likewise no-one in their right mind is going to carry 1000 BTC around for day to day spending, so for that you need a secure storage medium that is going to protect the keys long term. 


That is a totally different conversation, and not what the OP was after.
When you are talking a quarter million dollars worth of coins, it pays to be extra paranoid and protect as much as possible against a range of reasons why you might lose your private keys. 
- Online wallets (coins kept on exchanges and the like) are completely vulnerable to theft, hacking, company collapse etc.. These should never be used for anything other than temporary storage. 
- Other online wallets (private keys generated by online web sites etc.) are vulnerable to viruses, trojans, cache attacks and the like, as well as network snooping. As others have pointed out, even HTTPS and TOR will not help you here, offline generation of keys is the only truly safe way.
- PC/Mobile and other hot wallets are all susceptible to theft; either via hacking, network snooping, trojans, viruses, or plain old physical theft. But also susceptible to hardware failure (ie. hard disk crash) or destruction. Even USB key backups aren't completely safe. These wallets are only good for storage of small amounts of spending money, just like a regular fiat wallet is. 
- Hardware cold wallets are great and all, but (correct me if I am wrong) are still susceptible to firmware attacks, oscilloscope hacks, as well as hardware failure by electrical, magnetic, water or fire damage. The device can also be simply stolen, smashed or lost, your coins might stay secure but if you can't get them what is the point. 
- [Brain wallets]( as I mentioned above are all good and fine until you suffer a stroke and forget the passphrase, not good for long term storage, but great for smuggling coins across borders safely if it ever comes to that.  
Which basically just leaves paper wallets. 
1. First they are safe from snooping or hacking, viruses, trojans, network sniffing and all other forms of electronic attack. The best (and only truly secure) way to create them is to do so from a completely 'off the grid' computer that is not connected to any network, is running a clean/fresh OS (such as Linux from a bootable CD) and running the website files via local files only. Then when you print them off, do so only on a completely non-network connected printer. Create them this way and there is zero chance anyone can get to the private keys without physical access to the PC at the exact time they are being created. [Details about this are here](
2. You can print multiple copies of each paper wallet, so as to allow an offsite backup copy for emergencies. If your primary storage location burns down, is flooded, blows up in a gas explosion, is robbed, etc. the backups at your secondary location will still let you get your coins safely out. 
3. BIP38 encryption of the wallets ensures that if a wallet does get stolen, without the password the thief will not be able to get the coins, and the backups will allow you to safely empty the wallets to move the coins out to new locations.
4. To protect against physical damage, you have the backups, but what if a mass disaster happens and there is a tidal wave and your whole town get's flooded or a huge fire burns down half the neighborhood? Sure this stuff is unlikely to happen to you but it does happen, so it is reasonable to take basic steps to allow for this. Simple precautions against water damage are called for. This means at the least a) using a laser printer and most definitely not an ink jet, a single drop of water will destroy an ink jet print in seconds. b) putting the wallets in zip lock bags. The waterproof/heat resistant paper I linked to above adds an additional level of security here by making the paper so much harder to be destroyed. Finally, as a simple protection against fire damage, keeping all your wallets in a fireproof bag (and ideally storing them in a secure safety deposit box, or a fireproof safe) is a cheap and simple precaution.  
@_date: 2015-04-15 03:59:57
Multiple [offline generated BIP 38 encrypted Paper Wallets]( printed on [tear resistant, heat resistant, waterproof paper]( sealed with [tamper evident holographic stickers]( protected by individual ziplock bags, stored in a [fireproof bag]( and kept in a secure, fireproof safe or safety deposit box at a secure location. 
Lots of people like them but I don't trust hardware wallets, I worry about electro magnetic fields or hardware failure destroying them. Even a brain wallet is a worry, what if you hit your head or suffered a stroke or something?

Your BTC are in the blockchain, not in your computer or wallet, so as long as you have the keys you have the coins. Be sure to copy your wallet.dat to somewhere safe (located in the C:\Users\{yourloginid}\AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin folder if you have a windows machine)
To check that your coins are all okay and still there, search for your public address on  &amp; you should see your coins there. 
Now you are happy you haven't lost your coins - next work out why the client isn't syncing - likely it is network/firewall issues.

If the cops get your laptop (or are told by the exchange where you bought your coins what the addresses are for your account), then they get the starting points and it is just a matter of following the blockchain to see where the money in those addresses went/came from. If they can show a path from multiple addresses that are provably yours all flowing back to a known address of a black market, drug dealer or buyer, well you are fucked really. 
In this case, the cops had both ends - the silk road addresses, and the corrupt agent's addresses. From there is was just a matter of connecting the dots between them, childs play really.

Ironic isn't it? An article telling big businesses they owe it to themselves to move into bitcoin, on a web site owned by one of the world's biggest corporations that is trying to force people to subscribe to the newspaper using a credit card in order just to read an article. 
When we are on the street buying a newspaper do we have to subscribe to buy a paper, and give over our personal details? No we just pay a few cents and pick up a paper anonymously. 
If Murdoch had half a brain, he would stick a QR code micropayment system on that site and let readers pay a few cents to read the article instead of to choose between subscription and not reading the article, and bitcoin is exactly the technology they would need to do this. It would certainly rake in more cash than his doomed subscription model, and piss off potential subscribers a lot less.

The key word here is *should*.
Private companies who provide public services *should* not be able to tell people how they are permitted to use those services. Financial companies who provide public payment services *should* not be able to dictate how customers can legally spend their money. Just as Chick-fil-a should not be able to refuse service to gays, Visa *should* not be able to prevent donations to wikileaks, and Google *should* not be able to decide to ban bitcoin related transactions.

Thing is though, when you 'send' bitcoins to a wallet you are not actually sending them to the wallet itself, as the wallet only records the addresses you own and displays the information from the blockchain itself.

You are being downvoted, but you are right. In my post above (the distinction is difficult to tell from how I wrote it I admit) but I was genuinely posing a question and not making a statement. 
I don't think the US is a police  state, yet, but are definitely in that grey zone between a free country and a authoritarian one, and much much closer to the authoritarian side I think.
- Militarised police who have the power to seize property at will, and to arrest and detain all without any charges being made. 
- Secret prisons where people have been tortured.
- SWAT teams now bust down doors and arrest people for even the most minor of crimes.
- Police assaults on innocents, and even murders go unpunished in the vast majority of cases. 
- Tightly controlled borders, with a wall on the southern border.
- 100% warrantless surveillance of what we read and say online, or on our phones.
- Restrictions on free speech. Try hanging an ISIS flag in your window, or organising a peace rally in support of them in a public square - see how long it takes to get arrested.
So my question remains, where are we on that line? What is left that makes it indisputable that we have crossed it? Are we all the metaphorical frogs in boiling water that just haven't quite noticed just how hot the water has gotten lately?

You are correct. Casascius coins are lovely and real (but I would never buy one, there is no guarantee that the private key isn't in a secret file somewhere just waiting to be stolen when the price goes up). Much better to create your own keys offline where it is 100% safe.

Leaving the fee choice up to wallets to decide (on a programmers whim) what it should be is a stupid idea. We need a proper mechanism in the protocol to decide what people should be paying, it shouldn't be left up to individuals sending what they hope a miner will think is 'enough'.

**Non-paywall text version:**
On Saturday the price of one Bitcoin reached an all-time high of US$2000; at the time of writing, two days later, it is nudging US$2100, or A$2,800, and is not far off double the price of that more traditional alternative currency, gold.
Count me wide-eyed and nonplussed. What exactly is this thing that now costs the same as quite a nice TV — more than a return ticket to New York? And is it a bubble?
Bubbles are notoriously hard to identify in real time. When the item in question has fallen by 50 per cent, or better still returned to zero, it can safely be declared to have been a bubble. In the meantime it is merely a puzzle.
When Bitcoins rose in price from $1 to $100 there were plenty of sage observers saying it was a bubble; likewise when it did another 10-bagger from $100 to $1000. But demand continues to exceed supply, such that the price is close to tripling in 2017.
Which raises two questions: what demand? And what supply?
In some ways the second is easier to answer than the first. Bitcoins are mined with computers, lots of them, doing insanely complex algorithmic calculations. In fact it’s now so difficult and competitive that special hardware called Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) are used because using old CPUs, or even the first generation of ASICs, costs more in electricity consumption than the Bitcoin mined is worth.
Apparently the cost of mining a Bitcoin is currently US$1200, which provides a better margin than mining gold and explains why there’s such a rush on to “dig” them up.
It also explains why there is a fairly earnest effort at emulation and substitution going on: Wikipedia lists 24 other crypto-currencies, the most recent being Zcash, which was materialised in 2016 by one Zooko Wilcox and is described as “the first open, permissionless financial system employing zero-knowledge security”.
“Zero-knowledge” sounds like the one for me. Zcash currently sells for a snip at US$112.23 each, having reached US$1800 soon after it listed last October, so not a good one for the stags.
But back to Bitcoin, the market leader. There are two things that distinguish it from gold and help explain its superior price performance: first, the Bitcoin network automatically adjusts the difficulty of mining it every two weeks or so, making it harder so that the rate of “mine production” is kept steady as more and more energy and computational power is employed around the world and second, the total number of Bitcoins is to be capped at 21 million.
I read that 14 million have been mined so far, and counting. What happens when the number of 21 million is reached? Now that is an interesting question for monetary theorists, especially those within the hallowed walls of the world’s central banks, where there is no limit to the amount of dollars, euros and yen that can be mined, and where hardly any electricity at all is consumed in “mining” billions of them each week.
It used to be that currencies issued by central banks had to be backed by gold actually dug up out of the ground and refined, and before that silver as well, but those archaic shackles were finally removed on August 15th, 1971, since when the value of a dollar has collapsed to be one-sixth of what it was then.
So in one sense the demand for Bitcoins can be explained simply by the desire of many for a currency that can’t be debased by politicians and central banks: whose supply is limited and the difficulty of creating it gets harder all the time, rather than easier as economic principles are bent to order.
As a keen, heavy investor in Bitcoin was quoted as saying last week: “I think that something has to replace the current monetary insanity. It may or may not be Bitcoin. I don’t know what it is. I’m worried about the system — the integrity of the system. You can’t navigate that by working within the system. You have to be outside the system. Bitcoin is outside the system.”
That it is. But is it useful, as opposed to being a speculation on the insanity of the current monetary system, a role usually reserved for gold?
Well, it is useful for paying ransoms, particularly in the new digital kidnappings where someone locks your computer and demands Bitcoins to unlock it.
That provides a hint about some of its other non-investment uses, many of which involve some kind evasion of scrutiny.
But there is also a long list of law-abiding online retailers and service providers that accept Bitcoins as payment, including Microsoft, Subway, Bloomberg, Webjet, and Yacht-base.com, a Croatian yacht charter business.
How they all handle the rapidly rising price of Bitcoins can only be guessed at, although while it’s rising there is a nice profit between sale and banking the proceeds. Then again, are Bitcoins banked? I suspect not.
Yes, your correspondent remains wide-eyed, awe-struck and more than little bit left behind.
Does the price of $2800 per Bitcoin make it a more substantial alternative currency, or a speculative bubble that will soon be just a memory, filed away with tulips?
I’m afraid I simply don’t know.

I'm a hodl'r but I spend BTC any time I can, I just replace the coin I have spent at current price so it is really the same as if I had spent fiat. Apart from BTC being fun to spend (it is always fun to scan those codes, seeing the instant verification, it is simply just so much more exciting than boring paypal or credit cards), it also helps support my investment so always win-win.

I'm guessing the one guy who knows about it simply wasn't there at the time. What bitcoin really needs is better integration into POS systems, or even a card based system that works the same as a credit card - but with bitcoin instead. People using their smartphones - that was always going to be a stopgap solution for proper business use.

Cheapest way is to download the CPUMiner code and mine on your PC, its free. But you won't earn much - like a cent a week maybe.
This gets you into the low Kilohash range (thousand hashing operations per second), up from there you have the miner rigs which at the low end (USB miners, GPU setups, Raspberry Pi etc.) will be in the high Kh to low Megahash range, even these will only ever earn at most a few cents per week. 
Up from there you have the ASICs, these operate in the Gigahash range. A device such as an Antminer S3 will get you to 500Gh, and a setup will cost around $200-$300 if you buy one used, will earn you a few bucks a week as long as your power is cheap.
Up from there are the big boys, the Terahash ASICs, prices are typically in the $1k-2k range to buy a 1-2Th system, maybe you will get $15-25pw (?) from one, again dependant on how cheap you get your power.

NO SUCH THING. 
Think of it like this. Cloud miners claim to be able to generate X bitcoins via their mining setups, invariably it will be some amount that is worth more in BTC than you pay for the service (because unless you make more than you spend what is the point right!)
Why on earth would anyone charge a smaller fee (Y) to mine X amount of bitcoins when they could just mine the bitcoins themselves and make more money? No sane person would do this unless, the Y fee is actually greater than the amount of coins you will earn. 
Cloud mining is a scam, it always will be. If you really want to play around with mining, buy a used miner (say Antminer S3 or similar) and run it from home, excellent chances are you won't make much at all unless you have access to cheap electricity (I have solar panels on my house so I am able to make about a buck or two a day from my 4 S3 miners). 
Other than that save your money, forget about next gen hardware, forget about cloud mining, use it to buy coins directly from the market. BTC mining is only profitable at all if you have millions to spend and super cheap electricity, the days of making anything real at home are long gone.

People have grown up their entire lives worshiping at the alter of money. They are obsessed with it. They spend their whole days working hard to earn more, they save it diligently, it is the center of their entire lives and their ability for them and their family's very survival and prosperity is contingent on how much they have at any one time. 
Most cannot, and will not accept that at the heart of things money is just slips of paper. Ask most people on the street what backs money and they will say it is backed by gold or silver. To them in contrast Bitcoin is something that is made up, it is just worthless digital numbers because it is not truly 'made of anything', not like *real money* which is worth something because... well because they don't know any better that it is (like bitcoin) only backed by belief.

I'm old(ish), and have been around computers since the the end of the punch card and paper tape days. I remember handing out my email to people as my main contact method when backpacking Europe back in the day, a lot of people just looked at me like I was some sort of geek weirdo when I asked if they had email. A few years later everyone had email because it just made sense. All those idiots scoffing stoppped pretty quick when they actually used it and could see how much better it was.
I remember using an early brick sized mobile in the street after a concert to try and get a cab, and actually had several people yell "yuppie scum" and the like at me. A few years later everyone bought one because they were so much more convenient.
People crap on about bitcoin being too hard for the general public, that it would never catch on, etc. Well maybe, but I have seen it time and time again and the problems with BTC today are all minor when you look at them objectively. If a solution is faster, better and cheaper than what exists today, it will find acceptance unless something comes along that is better. That's just basic evolution.

Bitcoin protocol allows a maximum of 21 million coins to be created, right now about 17 million exist. New coins are created into existence by miners who compete to be the first to find the answer to a hashing puzzle. The first who finds each block is rewarded with a reward to (currently) 25 btc, but starting from block 420000 that reward for finding a block becomes only 12.5 bitcoins instead. Every 4 years or so the reward will continue to halve until all the full 21 millions coins have been created (this is a long way off). 
The halving is important because it will mean there are 50% fewer coins being created which should increase scarcity of coins available to be sold and thus the price is expected to go up.

IMO the next step forward in BTC will not be the general public (that will be the final step as I see it), it will be the hardcore traders and speculators getting in on the act.

This is exactly the sort of thing that means Bitcoin is not going to go away ever. As soon as businesses start realising en-mass that a safe alternative exists that won't charge them fees - that is a game changer.

Yes I'm sure that is exactly how it happened. :-)

Difficult? It takes about 5 minutes and a smart phone app to start using Bitcoin, what's difficult about it?

Nobody really knows, anything anyone can say is at best a guess.
My guess, having experienced first hand how archaic the banking systems are, and how hopelessly out of date thing like share transactions etc are ; it is only a matter of time till the existing financial markets move their shit onto the Blockchain and (realistically) there is only on that has true trustless security that is needed for such things - and that is Bitcoin.

Just don't. Safety is nothing to fuck with. 
Ignore this idiot, ALWAYS WEAR SAFETY GLASSES

This is the alt coin pumpers dropping out, almost every coin on coinmarketcap is down 20%. Starting to think this has all been a massive coordinated scam worth millions apron millions across the whole market which we are now seeing come the the final stages.
