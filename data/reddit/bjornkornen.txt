wow this is a neat idea, i'm definitely going to keep this in mind.
@_date: 2018-01-30 00:46:35
thanks again ketherah, its just a site hosted on heroku. i usually choose heroku for hackathons because you can get a site up quickly that anybody can access
@_date: 2018-01-30 12:59:44
Ha yup, I went to MIT so I thought I was being clever
@_date: 2018-01-30 00:47:25
not yet! :P but i really do want to make this a legitimate source of education for everybody
@_date: 2018-01-30 13:43:59
Also, sadly, none of the coverage is up from the event! I'm hoping it goes up soon so I can spread the word even more. I'm in need of devs and business people to move it along
@_date: 2018-01-30 00:43:57
yeah! i had to choose a name and this was the one that came to me. the demo site is just that, a demo, and i'd love to show off my original demo
EDIT: here's a link to the demos:  
you can find me at ~1hr 47min

great questions, thanks! could you expand on what you mean by giving back on purchase using coins? i'd like to know more.
i would want this to be a free educational resource, although that's the idealist in me talking. I want revenue to come in as a result of routing users to partners whose products they've learned to use. for example, it would be great to strike a deal with coinbase where we'd make tutorials for using their products, and in exchange we could make money from referrals.

That's ok, my project is not affiliated with Blockchain institute of Technology. Mine is for now, just a demo site at [bitcoin-institute-technology.herokuapp.com](

Thanks kprawn! 
@_date: 2018-01-30 13:01:11
I didn't hack anything in the sense of cracking it. I did hack together the site in a little over a day!
@_date: 2018-01-30 00:45:48
thanks! it was a surreal experience to win, especially because this was my third year attending having never placed before
@_date: 2018-01-30 02:00:19
thanks so much! you should help :O
@_date: 2018-01-30 01:12:15
i just wanted to get the word out because i was proud of my project. it's nice to post something on reddit finally!
@_date: 2018-01-30 00:45:03
just like ketherah said, this hackathon meant that i worked from 9am saturday to 11:30am sunday, coding away at this project from scratch
@_date: 2018-01-30 01:00:27
my idea for how to get sponsors was to create tutorials tailored to that sponsor's technology. so for instance, if i could make a deal with coinbase and get some funding, then i could build a course teaching a user how to create and use a coinbase wallet.

Ha yeah I guess even in my dreams I don't have that much money

I would say to him what I also say to the people who hype crypto to no end, prove what you say. I think when people say things like this, it's best to challenge them.

We just snagged 1st place at the Miami Bitcoin Hackathon, and are answering questions here: [
Bitcoin hackathons are a blast, does anybody else participate in them?
@_date: 2018-02-08 19:06:48
yes a few, the first being "what is an etf?"
@_date: 2019-01-24 20:10:43
I don't have any worry about Bitcoin surviving. It was nurtured by fanatics when it was just starting out, and I think that'll always be the case. I think it'll survive even if attempts to take it down got more hardcore. There would be the fanatics who believe in the cause enough to keep it alive.

hey thanks! lightning is the best!
@_date: 2018-02-12 02:12:39
hey thanks! i can't wait to get my prototype finished so i can show it off!
@_date: 2019-01-24 19:08:43
I didn't know enough to be able to make a prediction on price back in 2014, but in terms of robustness, I'd say that it's much further along than I anticipated. I thought that it would have collapsed. Instead, I'm impressed by its robustness and the fact that it becomes more secure as time goes on.

It's okay, it's not as scary as it sounds. A Hackathon is where a bunch of people get together and try to "hack" something together in about 24 hours. So you have 24 hours to make a website, a mobile app, whatever you want, and then have to do a presentation to win prizes. Here, the term "hack" is a good thing!

What's a ZJ?
@_date: 2018-02-24 00:02:44
@_date: 2018-02-23 19:56:47
you're too kind :)
@_date: 2018-02-23 19:22:17
Thanks! I have the demo running [here]( It might take a minute to load since it's been sleeping, but click Coding, then Private Keys to see what I demoed. It's very much just a prototype, but I think there's so much potential!
@_date: 2018-02-12 02:11:39
i agree, and i'm working to find ways to monetize this service while keeping access open. still looking for people!
