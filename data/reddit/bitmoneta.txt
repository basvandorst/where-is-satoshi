I had it wrong. You are right with the costs.
@_date: 2018-05-28 22:46:39
I do not agree with the cost of mining 1 BTC = $2000. Below are my rough calculations in laymen terms. I could be off my a few $100 but the numbers roughly are close:
* S9 miner = 13.5TH/s at 1.35 Kw or (10TH / 1Kw)
* BTC Hashrate = May 2018 - 34,801,568 TH/s for 12.5 BTC or (2,784,125 TH/s per 1 BTC)
* Cost in Kw = 2,784,125 Kw per 1 BTC
* if cost of electricity = $0.01 - 1 BTC = $2,784 to mine
* if cost of electricity = $0.02 - 1 BTC = $5,568 to mine
* if cost of electricity = $0.03 - 1 BTC = $8,352 to mine
* if cost of electricity = $0.04 - 1 BTC = $11,136 to mine
doing it at home 
* if cost of electricity = $0.12 - 1 BTC = $33,000+ to mine
If I made a mistake, please correct my calculation.

Is there a way to do "lock time" with a hardware wallet? Currently I have two trezors and two Ledger HW1 wallets. 
@_date: 2017-02-08 02:21:49
Your trezor holds the private keys that have been created using the 24 word seed. Your seed is capable of creating 2 billion private keys that only blong to you.  
Your trezor does not hold the bitcoin. The bitcoin is not held by any device whether it is a HW wallet or software wallet. The bitcoin sits on the bitcoin blockchain. To send your bitcoin, you use the private keys to sign a transaction that changes the ownership from one private key to another private key.  The bitcoin never moves, it only settles, that is, an entry is made in the bitcoin blockchain that changes the ownership.

Bitcoin or any other shitcoins do not exist in hardware wallets, phones, PCs, mobile phones, ect. These devices only hold the private keys that allow the settlement of your coins from one or more UTXOs to one or more other UTXOs. This settlement is often confused with moving the coins. Nothing moves. The coins merely change addresses in the blockchain ledger that is present on 1000's of nodes.

Bitcoin (BTC):    21 million bitcoins  
Satoshi (sat):    2.1 quadrillion satoshis
World Population: 7.53 billion
BTC / person:     0.002789 BTC
sat / person:     278,900 sat
If BTC becomes world reserve currency, it will be worth at least $100 trillion USD ($4.8 million/BTC or $0.047/sat). 
That means that having 278,000 sats will be worth about $13,000 USD. Today, the average person in the world is not even worth $1,000 USD.
So yes, 21 million bitcoins is enough for the world plus 10 more planets. So yes, we can start trading with aliens once they show up.

Yes, it is possible to have HD. Follow the steps. Below is my setup.&lt;Enter&gt;
1. HD has a directory "_bitcoin" (this is where the blockchain sits)&lt;Enter&gt;
2. create directory "/home/pi/.bitcoin" (.bitcoin exists, MOVE CONTENTS TO HD's _bitcoin DIRECTORY)&lt;Enter&gt;
3. create directory "/home/pi/myHD" (this is where you will mount you HD)&lt;Enter&gt;
4. using command "sudo blkid"  - find the name of your HD (should be "/dev/sda1")&lt;Enter&gt;
5. Mount HD --&gt; sudo mount /dev/sda1 /home/pi/myHD&lt;Enter&gt;
6. sudo mount --bind /home/pi/myHD/_bitcoin /home/pi/.bitcoin&lt;Enter&gt;
7. That is it. Now /home/pi/.bitcoin is pointing to you HD's _bitcoin directory&lt;Enter&gt;
8. To avoid doing it manually on startup, do a script.&lt;Enter&gt;
sudo mount /dev/sda1 /home/pi/myHD&lt;Enter&gt;
sudo mount --bind /home/pi/myHD/_bitcoin /home/pi/.bitcoin&lt;Enter&gt;
# EXTRA LINES TO START bitcoind&lt;Enter&gt;
# check if "/home/pi/.bitcoin" is mounted and start bitcoind &lt;Enter&gt;
sleep 1&lt;Enter&gt;
a=`ls /home/pi/.bitcoin | grep block`&lt;Enter&gt;
if[ ${a} = 'blocks' ]; then&lt;Enter&gt;
	sleep 2&lt;Enter&gt;
	bitcoind # works if bitcoind is a daemon&lt;Enter&gt;

IDEA ONE
1. use 24 words on a piece of paper and mash up the original order according a certain order that only you know.
Suppose you have 3 kids with Birthdays
1. John - May 20
2. Alice - Jan 5
3. Drew - Dec 23
Use the days to mash up the original order and write this on top
Jo -&gt; Al -&gt; Dr (in your brain it is 20 -&gt; 5 -&gt; 23)
so 
word 20 will go to 5
word 5 will go to 23
word 20 will go to 20
If some would get these words, it would still take a very long time to find the original order. The more number you mash up, the better.
IDEA TWO
1. put the 24 words in KeePassX store on 3 usbs
2. give the password to your most trusted person, ie, mother or father.
IDEAD THREE
combine idea 1 and 2.

Create a brain wallet that is easy to remember only for you. As an example: "John Smith was born to parents Frank Smith and Jane Doe in the city of London England on June 3, 1980"     1. Change all letters to small so that there will be no confusion. 2. And change a to  o to 0 (zero), l to 1.  Your done. To have 100's of wallets from this one sentence, add a number at the end like 1,2,3,4,5,...,1002, 1003, etc. Keep a Google docs of the numbers that you used so that you will not reuse the same wallet twice.

to use an HD:
- your HD should have a directory for example "_bitcoin"
- then create directories in /home/pi
- "sudo mkdir E"
- "sudo mkdir .bitcoin"
- then mount HD to "E" (E is on HD)
- "sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /home/pi/E" where /dev/sdb1 is your HD (find your HD using "sudo blkid")
- then mount 
"sudo mount --bind /home/pi/E/_bitcoin /home/pi/.bitcoin"
- that is it (by mounting, your pi will see your HD a just ".bitcoin" directory in /home/pi/.bitcoin)

I love both Trezor and Ledger Nano S. The only nuisance I have with Ledger Nano S is the Ledger Chrome Wallet application.  The Ledger Chrome Wallet application does not allow me to send BTC to multiple addresses. Trezor's chrome app does allow sending to multiple addresses.

Having private blockchains is a bad bad idea for one reason only. Instead of a hacker hacking one bank's network, he has many to play with. All he has to do is hack one of them and it is as if he hacked all of them. Private blockchains will be the biggest security risk the banks will face. This will bring the biggest bank failures in history. Man WTF are they doing. Banks, wake up and smell the coffee. Do YOU know that blockchains need to be public, open and decentralized.

Trezor has passphrase protection as an option. This means you can have several hidden wallets protected by a passphrase. Have one wallet WITHOUT a passphrase with a small amount of BTC (like 1-2 BTC). Have the rest in a passphrase protected wallet. If Customs ask you what the Trezor is and threatens you, just tell the truth (halve truth). Open the wallet (without a passphrase) with little BTC.
Also, when you are about to go thru Customs, make sure you disable the passphrase option so that if you are asked to log into your Trezor, the passphrase option does not pop up. When at home, enable the passphrase option. Disabling your passphrase option does not erase your hidden wallet. I have done it many times. 
I was never asked about my Trezor at customs because I keep it in the luggage.

If you want to use Hardware Wallets in trustless mode, you can. The best way is to have Linux running on PC, laptop or raspbarry that is offline. Have electrum running on that offline computer. Use the offline computer to sign your Trezor or Ledger transactions. Save the signed transaction to a usb stick and transfer to a live computer and broadcast. This gives you control by inspecting the signed transaction.
