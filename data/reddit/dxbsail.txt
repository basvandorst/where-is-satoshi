I believe it is the day before the CME futures settlement date (17th) so its to be expected some market manipulation.

Don’t lie about how long it’s been....
I had the same issue Mine was resolved 3 days ago after 9 days. And my ticket number was 250000 lower than yours....  it ideal but only 2 days slower than they promised at the outset. 
Tweet at Richie about it. Seems to work.

Also in the same boat.

The cryptography is the easy part that is bolted on off the shelf. Simple well understood stuff relatively. It's the distributed bit torrent like p2p part that is the complicated part

I moaned a bit at richie on twitter. was resolved after 2 weeks.

I got my money back from them.
I live in the UAE and they had a UAE account which meant they had a registered business here. I simply told them that if I didn't get it back I would file a legal case against them. I advised them that if they were to even come close to arriving in the UAE or transit through here and there was a criminal case against them they would head straight to the clink. 
I got my money back the next day...

My god. You could put a glass eye to sleep with your posts. Arguments from authority using a stream of conciousness writing style are quite possibly the WORST way to get your point across.
I'm just a hodler in this for speculative gain like a significant majority. Unfortunately the more Bitcoin grows the larger the percentage of users who are like me will become. Unfortunately, as we well know the network needs people like me in order for the network's security model to function. If Bitcoin isn't worth anything because there are no speculators then who would invest in mining it? As the percentage of speculators (who you can assume are on average not quite so libertarian as the early adopters) grows you would expect the core political beliefs of users and thus their expectations of what Bitcoin is to move away from the original ideals.
Bitcoin has an opportunity to be good enough. Good enough to change the world and a vast majority of the politics of value. However, if  it is hobbled before it gets anywhere near the tipping point needed to achieve that goal then it will merely turn into a niche, wealthy mans tool to avoid the tax man.
The politics and development decisions that are made right now based on your own personal politics could well be the hobble that makes the adoption difference

Nope by economic incentives I mean big picture "bitcoin as a system". Not the ins and out of DOS attacks or any other stuff that the boffins preach about. I mean the high level incentives to do with block rewards and fee markets. I mean the high level incentives that cause the miners to want to secure the system. 
Consider that miners incentives cause them to view what bitcoin might be in the future differently to your old school cypherpunk. I understand that users ultimately matter to but make no mistake, without miners there is no bitcoin, just like users. Ultimately it has to be that bitcoin is what the miners want as well as what the users want as they are the ones secure it. Until core realizes that they are in a symbiotic relationship we will have this shit. Until they realize they can't have the economic experiment without the social one and the political one then we will have this shit. Until they realize that miners are economic (capitalist) actors and not particularly bothered about their (cores) ideology then we will have this shit. 
Posted this in 3 parts between toddler bed time and dinner with the wife. Hope it makes sense. 
PS. I'm in it for the money. Not to make the world a better place. Once they realize that's true for a good portion of users and all the miners maybe they'll understand the NYA.

Or like me a generally silent user who tends to agree with S2X and generally LOLs at the autistic bleating of Lombrozo on twitter, the broken record of Adam Back on twitter and the stubborn myopic repetitiveness of Matt Corallo. 
Here is to the high priesthood of bitcoin. The developers who call themselves core. Until they understand that the thing that makes the whole thing function is the economic incentives and if they don't get those right when they make changes (e.g. Segwit, or leaving blocks to get full as that is clearly a change...) then nothing they propose will get implemented....
That's why NYA. Because the economic incentives lined up enough to get political agreement. Which previous proposals from core had not done.

Trapped? Or simply in a political deadlock which means that the code has ossified / changing it will be like walking through a vat of treacle...

ARKW is a fairly broad web x.0 tracking fund which is about 6% GBTC. I own a bit of it as it is the only way to get exposure without directly owning GBTC / bitcoin.

I like 21's idea and I get where they are going with it although...
Seems like it could end up being a way to create hashes out of thin air in the sense of fractional reserve banking and banks creating money...

You will run into issues with limits at the localexchanges just like anywhere else in the world. They are pretty up on the AML over here as it's obviously a hotbed for terrorism financing and western governments seriously push them on it.
