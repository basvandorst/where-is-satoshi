Okay then, let me try something.
I have bought some BCH and think it is a very interesting cryptocurrency. I do not intend to get rid of it yet and I hodl both BCH and BTC.

He's not wrong, though. I've been a follower of this sub, and other crypto subs, and r/bitcoin has become nothing but salt for a while now.  
It used to give interesting info or news about bitcoin and where it was headed and whatnot, along with funny memes about how the value skyrocketed and all the lambos we were going to buy. 
But now? It's all about attacking BCH and calling it "Bcash" over and over to the point where the BCH side now has embraced it, reporting Roger Ver and his site to the authorities as a scam for no genuinely valid reason (and him being smug and pompous isn't one), banning people attempting to have a genuine discussion, labeling BCH as a fraud with no real explanation as to why it would be more of a fraud than BTC, apologizing completely wrong decisions regarding BTC technology, and just downright acting like a bunch of fanatics on a witch hunt with the paranoid delusion that anyone who is willing to address this issue is a shill or working for Ver. Like conspiracy theorists.
It's so tedious seeing everying single post on here being not about the positives of BTC, but solely on the perceived negatives of BCH. 
You are all essentially behaving like a bunch of kids who can't get over a break-up with an ex-girlfriend and resort to calling her a slut over and over on social media.
If this sub wants to be about bitcoin, then stop talking about bitcoin cash.
