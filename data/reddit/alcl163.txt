can you link to it please?

It probably did, but no one noticed. The only reason I found it is because I went to Gavin's page to look for his comments about the 20mb block upgrade.

That's not it. You can see his comment has 5 points.

What prevents banks, regulators, and large companies from making their own cryptocoin and use it instead of bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-04-25 14:14:43
They have the means and power to create one.

Read my question again.

How many are made by banks, regulators, and large companies?

I would assume they keep them dormant for sometime until the fuss is all gone. Then they use underground mixers and unregulated exchanges to wash them up in portions.

Thank you for correcting the article.
[One]( of the threads that was made yesterday was by bitcoinpaperwallet.com owner. If you look through his [User contribution]( page, it's mostly dedicated to promoting his private commercial site. His first contribution was making a wiki page about his site [BitcoinPaperWallet]( Other edits of his was adding that site to: 
* [Businesses for promoting Bitcoins]( 
* [Paper wallet]( 
* [How to set up a secure offline savings wallet](
* [Open-source useful tools](
* [Trade](
It seems like he was pissed off because was harming his business by [removing links to his website](
