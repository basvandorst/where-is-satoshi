Username checks out, not what I wanted to hear. I'm not a troll just a dumby that invested  a few months ago and have made regular purchases over the following months. Now with the intense change in price, I want to ensure my security. Switching to hardware wallet

So to clarify. As they are stored right now, in airbitz, after the fork i need to move my BTC ? I get that since i have my private keys they dont get split, then why am i moving anythimg around?

Again thanks very much! I've read the attached guide and holy crap thats an insane amount of work just to get my coins. I don't BCH, who really does anyway, how do i just either convert my BCH to BTC or just USD? Is there a faster way then the guide that requires me to get the BCH.
Edit: Ill just sent it to gatehub to convert.
Edit part 2: BCH aquired and is safe, has the gold spilt happened yet? I know 2x isnt in till later in nov.. If gold happened how do i get those coins?

Thanks so much for your help and support. I got the moving part, create a new wallet then after the fork move back, to kinda leave no private keys trail during the split.
I have been holding for about a year, i really havent moved or touched my coins. So when the a hardfork happens, how do i claim the others coins? I understand the BCH split happened recently, i haven't  claimed or changed anything over that period. Do i have unclaimed coins or something? 
Sorry for the noobie questions, and thanks in advance.
