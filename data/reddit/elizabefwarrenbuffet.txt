He said libertarians would really like it, and it might not convince you but thats more than enough proof for me.
@_date: 2013-05-07 03:10:18


Yup. Whether or not its a tiny/big fraction does not make it capitalist/socialist. The fact that the pool operator does not pay the same rate of operation costs as the workers is what makes it capitalist


But you can guarantee they pay the same amount of operating costs (because the workers own the MOP). In this situation the manager gets paid more AND pays no operating costs AND his wage is simply the rent from the labor. AND he privately controls the workplace AND he sets the terms of payment beforehand AND they dont even pay taxes
Pool Mining cryptocurrency in 2013 is one of the most heirarchal, privatized, CAPITALIST institutions in existence!
There is  a place, called p2pool that operates almost exactly how you describe socialism. [But as you can see]( they are small enough to be put in the "other" category
@_date: 2013-05-26 20:13:51
They are going to do it because you have  a legitimate claim, your employer broke his wage contract. And it wont be you asking, it will be your lawyer/insurance company, which if you cant afford will be pro bono, because you have  a legitimate claim and the lawyer will be compensated later

when I grew 10 foot weed plants I only told one soul, my friend tommy. one weekend in september I went to chicago, when I came back all the best plants were gone and the scrawny ones had orange circles spray painted at the base.
This is a police tactic so helicopters can easily spot the plants from the air, so the first person I told, "man the cops found my plants and destroyed most and marked some" was tommy.
Good thing tommy couldnt keep his braggy shitty little mouth shut and I found out he took them from a junkie friend of his. Goddamnit humans of only trust yourself.

Worker ownership of the means of production. This implies stopping private ownership of means of production.
Bitcoin makes it so the only way to stop private ownership of the mop is to outcompete a capitalist business with a worker owned business.
If the United States government cant catch a silk road vendor, the anticapitalists will never catch all the capitalists. And good for that, I say whoever gets the lowest price at the best quality should win my coin (even if its worker owned, I ain't picky!)

@_date: 2013-05-18 22:21:58
That very paragraph you have quoted says socialists hate freedom for capitalists to run  a business. Forget trying to convince people wage labor is slavery (it isnt) you literally cant stop capitalists who use TOR and Bitcoin. So seriously man get with the program and go work for a wage, save that wage and invest in some capital, if you profit you can hire a wage laborer to run your model, or be a "worker owned business" but you have no control over what the other workers spend their share on. I would spend almost everything on expanding the business, but I'm a filthy capitalist what do I know.

@_date: 2013-05-28 20:54:01
Thats quite a few steps of logic to justify a law this vague, but if this is how you think....you're really gonna hate the implications of cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2013-05-18 22:13:15
Then it is anarcho capitalist
@_date: 2013-05-07 05:16:30
Really? So "paying the private capitalist owner of the pool" is just an operating cost? Or does that completely change the relationship? 
@_date: 2013-05-07 04:57:09
The miners do not recieve proportion to the work, they recieve the terms agreed upon in the wage contract, an dthe terms are flat for everyone. Again, the pool operator privately owns the means of production. Capitalism is not  a measure of how fair/unfair something is, you are never going to convince me of that definition.  Capitalism is private ownership of the means of production, which makes every pool operator but p2pool  a capitalist.


Well now even if you delete your comment everyone will know what it said, and how absolutely arbitrary and nonsensical it is. Where is the line drawn, since you are so sure about those numbers? If the private owner of the means of production takes 23 of every 25 is it still capitalist? If the private owner of the MOP takes 22  of every 25 is it still capitalist? If the private owner of the MOP takes 21 of every 25 is it still capitalist? Where is the line?
@_date: 2013-06-04 18:51:30
Its only more profitable until the next difficulty change lol
@_date: 2013-05-07 06:35:29
The line is actually clearly drawn. The operator must take 0% fee for it to be considered socialist. Anything else makes him a capitalist profiting from wage labor. This is the actual difference between socialism and capitalism.
@_date: 2013-05-17 04:50:21
He makes me feel like its one of the best times to be a libertarian
@_date: 2013-05-07 02:22:24
Show me a pool operator that pays the same fees as the pool workers to his own pool. Hint-there isn't one because these are capitalist relationships. The pool owner pays no fees and the workers rent his server with part of their labor. The pool owner is 100% a legit capitalist

Of the workers currently earning an hourly wage, only two percent make minimum wage. Thats nowhere close to "many", and you're talking about a person incapable of being worth minimum wage which is an even **smaller** number than 2% of hourly workers. Lastly, why would there be laws against charity, you know, the way we've handled people who can't contribute?
