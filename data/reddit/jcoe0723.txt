Nicely said TrefoilHat! Another Xbox One user here...After all the posts and such today I finally decided to read into and learn about Bitcoin. Excited to be apart of the community now. :)

Fellow Xbox One user here! Just started reading and learning into Bitcoin. Excited to be apart of the community! :)

If you don't mind me asking...I just looked up BitWage...Is that site legit?  Like do you somehow hook up your employer with them and your paycheck gets sent to them and they convert it and you get paid in bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:41:58
If your a beginner and only hold a couple hundred or less than a hundred dollars in bitcoin, I would recommend just using a mobile wallet app such as Breadwallet, Airbitz, or Mycelium. It’s much easier more beginner friendly that way than dealing with a paper wallet. Once you start to accumulate a good amount of bitcoin and you want more protection, then you can look into paper wallets or hardware wallets such as trezor or ledger Nano s. You can research those options in the mean time while using a mobile wallet app.

I mean, I definitely have my own private key if I have my bitcoin stored on say the mobile Blockchain wallet? Not sure if the key I have on that wallet is my "private key"? 
Basically if that's a yes, then all I would have to do is transfer the bitcoin from my mobile wallet to GDAX or Coinbase and it'll automatically show the BTC and B2X?
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:37:22
Bitfinex doesn’t work in the US anymore does it?
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:24:54
Dang really? I was having issues with Blockchain mobile wallet this morning and moved my coins to Breadwallet.....seems to work fine so far. 
As far as selling the forked currency, I thought I read that if you sell the b2x coins you get then you also lose your btc? Or something like that
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:55:35
I'm a little confused...I'm trying to sell some bitcoin on GDAX...Not on the limit option, but as market...And I'm getting an error that says "Order size is too small. Minimum size is 0.01" 
What does this mean? That there's a minimum amount you have to sell even on the market option?
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:57:33
Yes, GDAX and Coinbase are the same company. But, here's the e-mail I got from Coinbase specifically if you'd like to see it:






Coinbase users will be able to trade both Bitcoin and Bitcoin2x shortly after the fork. 
Coinbase will disable buys, sells, sends and receives for Bitcoin and Bitcoin2x approximately 24 hours before the fork. We will re-enable them following the fork once it’s safe to do so.
For a detailed timeline of events surrounding the fork please see our blog post and FAQ.

If I’m not mistaken, didn’t mt. Gox have security as well?
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:36:30
By online wallet I’m guessing they’re online referring to things such as Coinbase vault/wallet and the like. If you use an open source mobile app wallet such as Breadwallet, mycelium or airbitz, then that would be fine until you invest a considerable amount. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:47:49
Don’t open source mobile wallets such as blockchain or Breadwallet not have access to the keys? They’re your own private keys just like a paper wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:48:04
As a newbie, I’m trying to get started on purchasing with GDAX...it just stinks that you have to wait around a week for funds to be deposited into it from your bank...
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:28:36
Well I was using blockchain mobile wallet before and it glitches and bugged out a lot and wouldn’t let me get into my wallet some times. And that’s like the highest rated iOS wallet from what I saw...So I switched. Haven’t had any issues so far
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:19:45
$7320. Might hit it in the next hour the way it’s going right now
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:04:36
~1344 euro now. Nice gainz 
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:41:53
It didn’t require me to have one when I made it, but there’s an option for “Backup Funds” which I did that had me write down 12 words.

Jesus, I just waTched the price on gdax go from like 11,050 to 11250 in the matter of less than a minute...

6600? I’m seeing $6970...unless your referring to something else
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:44:32
Maybe fiat/gold is MySpace and bitcoin is Facebook.
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:39:24
People recommend taking it off Coinbase and putting it either in 1. Hardware wallet (such as Trezor or ledger Nano s) 2. Paper wallet or 3. Mobile wallet (such as Breadwallet, airbitz, mycelium) in that order. The whole point of bitcoin is to completely own your money. If you keep your bitcoin on Coinbase, while still technically your money, Coinbase is the one that holds the keys to it. So for example, if something such as Mt. Gox (google for more info) were to happen again, and Coinbase gets hacked and all the bitcoin gets stolen, then your out of luck. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:20:14
It's from an e-mail I received from them about 2 hours ago at 4:50PM US Eastern.

@_date: 2017-11-02 12:06:10
Why move all your bitcoin out of a wallet to Coinbase? Don’t you still get the forked currency even if it’s stored in a private wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:42:07
It’s probably likely that when you purchased the bitcoin it was worth more than it is now. The price of bitcoin dropped and you “lost” $4 maybe?
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:15:08
There’s a thread stickied at the top of the forum for price discussion.
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:41:05
...but isn’t breadwallet a mobile wallet? What’s different between that and Blockchain on iOS? 
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:29:23
I wouldn’t necessarily say your timing was “good”, as a year ago the price was around $1000 per bitcoin. A couple weeks ago it was at $5000. But the next best time is always now so enjoy the ride. Asking for expectations is kinda useless...no one knows where it will end up but everyone will tell you the expectation is that it will continually rise over time. There might be a pretty steep dip at the coming fork but from what I’ve read, just hold out and it’ll eventually keep rising.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:15:27
It’s almost at $12,000 now. It’s risen from $11,000 to almost $11,500 within just the past couple minutes alone. Don’t wait for a dip or you’ll be left behind.
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:50:28
Damn. Wonder what caused that small bubble burst.
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:01:41
No, I mean Blockchain the mobile iOS app.
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:58:49
As a new user, I'm a bit confused about this. If I have my bitcoin stored on a mobile wallet...Do I not get any B2X? Should I transfer it all to GDAX?
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:22:09
Jeez, it rose so fast to $7300 and now it dropped to $7100 in the matter of seconds
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:50:30
Hardware wallet is a must when you have a considerable amount invested. What you think a considerable amount is is up to you. The cheapest recommendable hardware wallet is the ledger Nano S which costs like $60ish I think. So if you only own $25 or $50 in bitcoin, not really worth it. 
By online wallet, like I said, that’d be considered just using Coinbases wallet or the like. If you get an open source mobile wallet like the ones mentioned above, that would be fine until you have enough to make a hardware wallet worth it.
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:43:12
Heck, even 1 month ago. It was around $4800 at the beginning of October.
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:57:23
Maybe $0.50 to a dollar if your lucky
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:24:53
Can’t tell if this is sarcasm? Breadwallet is definitely one of the more recommended mobile wallets on here for iOS. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 02:39:22
As someone else who is new...What I want to know is...Everyone says if you leave your coins on Coinbase, that you don't truly "own/control" those coins. But how is Breadwallet, or any other desktop/mobile based wallet any better? Aren't those applications owned by whoever made them? Wouldn't that make them the same as Coinbase in a sense? 
@_date: 2017-10-31 13:12:13
GDAX and Coinbase are owned by the same company. Your Coinbase account is the same as your GDAX account and vice versa. If you have a Coinbase account then you already have a GDAX account automatically for example.
@_date: 2017-10-30 03:22:13
So...newbie here. I purchased about $20 of bitcoin to dip my toes in about a week ago. I looked into some wallets and have chosen to use the blockchain mobile wallet app for now. I just transferred the coins from Coinbase to Blockchain, but I noticed afterwards that I was charged approx. $4 in fees to transfer $20 from coinbase? That's like a 20% fee? Is this normal? Did I do something wrong?
@_date: 2017-10-16 18:05:15
Can I get some examples? Newish person here
@_date: 2017-10-30 18:54:13
Weird...Yeah I didn't see any options about customizing fee. Needless to say, a $4 fee on just transferring $20 put a bad taste in my mouth...
@_date: 2017-10-31 12:54:12
I’m a newbie, so take this with a grain of salt, but from everything I’ve read I think mobile wallets are actually more secure than desktop wallets due to a higher risk of Trojans/malware with desktops. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 12:56:43
I think airbitz, mycelium, blockchain and breadwallet are typically the most recommended wallets. Not sure if airbitz is on android either.
