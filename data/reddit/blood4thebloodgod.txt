This is a great thing. This gives people a reason to hold bitcoin. If I'm in the know, why hold 1000$ dollars in dollars when I could hold 1000$ dollars worth of Oct 2012 Bitcoins that one year late are likely (give then current trend of increasing demand) to be worth a whole lot more than they are now. 
Then once I'm holding a lot of my cash in bitcoin I get to experience first hand how simple the transactions are and am more likely to use it as my currency of choice when possible. This will create a demand for business activity that is conducted in btc.

Wasn't the 2007 housing market crash due to banks granting mortgages that really shouldn't have been granted? Essentially too many people were in the housing market on credit. I don't see how that applies since the vast majority Bitcoins are bought with cash. 
Also the supply of houses is a function of construction. Similar to central banks printing currency, the supply of homes can easily be increased/manipulated. Bitcoin supply growth is controlled.

This is my take on things right now and I encourage those who feel bitcoin has the potential to play a large role in future financial activity to adopt it. Market panic will only hurt bitcoin's credibility. 
Volatility is nerve wracking (I'm sure we're all keenly aware of this right now) but it is brought about by the fact that adoption/interest/acceptance is mounting while bitcoins are in short supply. These conditions breed boom-bust cycles. While dramatic these conditions should be expected. Bitcoin will only stabilize once it's market capital stabilizes which could potentially be many boom-bust cycles away from now. 
Persons who see bitcoin as a transformative technology (corny, yes, but I think it's hard to deny that bitcoin has the *potential* to be quite game changing) should adopt the tactic of maintaining a long term perspective and stomach the waves of volatility created by bigger fish that are beginning to poke around in the bitcoin economy. See boom-bust cycles for what they are; a sign that interest in bitcoin is increasing.
If we maintain resolve and continue to build and improve the bitcoin network we could one day replace old institutions like visa with a system fit for the 21st century. "Viva la bitcoin price level resistance".
'Meta' note: The content of this comment is rhetorical. I do not believe this to be a bad thing. I'm speaking to those people who value bitcoin not as a speculative game to play but as a genuinely good idea. To genesis something as new and abstract as an decentralized cryptological currency is going to require more than a system w/ sound design and superior efficiency. It is going to need persons who possess an idealism for bitcoin and who are willing to adopt game theory tactics that benefit the system as a whole. Bitcoin may fundamentally be a more efficient medium of exchange compared to visa or paypal but to challenge and defeat such throughly entrenched institutions we (the people thinking about bitcoin here and now in 2013) must muster the aggressive strategies and collective sense of nutsack that bitcoin deserves. It'd be amazing to me and a serious step in the right direction if this sub started performing organized action w/ posts like: "This weekend go out and have a conversation with a local merchant about accepting bitcoin" etc.  This kinda of action could have an actual impact on the growth of bitcoin's market capital and would collectively benefit all of us.
TL;DR: If believe in bitcoin then hold or buy goods with your coins, don't exchange them for cash. The denizens of will be better off in the long run because of it. With bitcoin, collective thinking is strategic thinking.

It is hard to offer an explanation as OP's video and its relationship with bitcoin touches on some slippery and ineffable concepts that can easily sound corny/empty when put into words. I'll take a shot.
Associating this video with bitcoin states that bitcoin is a paradigm changing information technology that will empower individuals and will aid the organic/ground up/honest "becoming" of Humanity.
Probably the best way to understand this would be to spend sometime researching/thinking about bitcoin and the state of Humanity as of April 2013* then follow Terence Mckenna's advice and take a whole bunch of shrooms alone in a dark room. 
EDIT: *just so they are fresh in your mindset.

I am making a prediction based off the pattern of the last bitcoin crash. BTC will remain in a downtrend until it finds a price to stably remain at for many months. After that it'll have consolidated enough to make new investors feel safe.
I think BTC hitting 120 in the next couple of months would only happen as a result of there being a novel application that pops up, changes the game, and prompts new investment. 
Furthermore I think putting money into bitcoin is still too difficult/inconvenient for the non-tech savvy.

You're totally right I'm just trying to create connections. And yes my comment is tongue in cheek. 
That said, there is something extra that makes me inclined to play the fool in this situation... Thinking like this isn't an exercise in finding rational scientific truths. Instead it's more akin to the intellectual pornography that is conspiracy theories. 
There are people who think about conspiracy/new-age theories and (IMHO:) delusionally think that doing so is important because eventually they will find THE TRUTH which will CHANGE EVERYTHING. This is missing the point. New age revelations and conspiracy theories are, in a certain sense, useful but their use comes solely from thinking and talking about them. It's like weight lifting except instead of strengthening your muscles you are bulking up your bullshit detector and becoming comfortable with taking an outside perspective. 
It can also be thought of as a test: when you encounter and consider a system of mythology like Christianity or "New-agey" theories like timewave zero are you able to maintain your status as a free thinker and merely explore these mythologies and the stories that they tell OR does the mythology consume you? pulling you in and making you "a believer".

The price wouldn't stay at 120 with 'some growth'. Growth = more demand = increase in price.

You're right it sounds totally ridiculous. It's hilarious and it makes me laugh.
However, I admire McKenna's attempt develop some kind of mathematical system that models something as abstract as novelty in the universe. 
Could you ever have a computer program or formula that achieves something like that? It's like the 'timewave zero' program is a weird art project that seeks to explore that question. 
[This article from Scientific American]( gives some decent context as to where Terence McKenna is coming from. In the spirit of TLDR here are some relevant quotes that give you the jist of it:

@_date: 2013-04-07 17:53:11
I'm gonna be the loon here and point out that bitcoin's exponential rise began in early 2013. Terence McKenna (the speaker in the video) in his timewave zero theory of novelty predicted an explosion of novelty occurring at the end of 2012.  
Bitcoin allows for more novelty in our world. Lower transactional fees enable us to do new things, like bitcoin tip.

How many users does bitcoin have? Is there any way to measure this?
@_date: 2013-04-01 22:26:03
The bitcoin market will stabilize when the amount of money being held in bitcoin is stable. 
Bitcoin's current market cap is 1 Billion USD. W/ ~10 Million Bitcoins you get $100 Bitcoins. The amount of monetary value currently transfered yearly over the internet is in the trillions. The question you should ask yourself is: how much of that financial traffic will bitcoin be used for?
Bitcoin will stabilize when its user pool stabilizes.
