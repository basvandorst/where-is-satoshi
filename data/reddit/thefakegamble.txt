You can always use gyft.com to buy Target gift cards with Bitcoin, and get rewards.

Which means the bad people get away with it, and the good people get charged for them getting away with it.

Hmm guess I'm uninformed then. Links?

Only it's a lot easier to get away with BTC than other things. Therefore, the good people will have to pay a much higher rate than usual.

Hence why the price will continue to go up if Bitcoin remains in use.

You missed the other main point. It's decentralized... well, mostly.

Yeah, and you only need to play 3250 hours to get an iPhone to play it on!

Haha apparently not too many other Bitcoiners are gamblers

Stop giving Cameron more ideas

Nope and I've been doing it for like a solid month now.

No, it's a broker.

I mean I wasn't retarded about it. Required separate verification through email, high feedback, etc. Regardless, I've only sold about .5 BTC at about double market value so I'd have to see over half the people chargeback for this to go negative. I feel like that's doubtful since most have already left positive feedback.

I've had easily over 50 transactions selling BTC on eBay. Haven't had any problems so far.

Quick, buy BTC with it now!
