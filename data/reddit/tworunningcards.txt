You still have it.  Multibit has your keys.  You have many addresses in your wallet, not just one.

I can buy a coin off you if you want to do paypal...
(Yes, I know people shy away from PP for BTC but it's only what I have available at the moment)
@_date: 2011-07-19 01:57:01
You don't have $12-15?

These are closer to cash that self-destructs on conversion to digital.

I'm just going to let my computer cool down a bit and save a little energy
@_date: 2011-07-19 03:01:41
So skip a night of drinking and put that cash aside for some bitcoins.  One night won't make a difference and you'll have some btc.

What about [BitBills](
@_date: 2011-07-05 16:51:44
I've only got about 170MH/s so it's really not a big deal to be down for a bit.
@_date: 2011-07-03 13:34:26
They're called BitBills...
@_date: 2011-06-14 19:22:23
Try one of the bitfaucets
@_date: 2011-06-09 18:38:41
I tried mtred but it went down a few times over the past day so I headed over to btcguild for a few until mtred seems more stable.
@_date: 2011-06-08 19:38:23
Faucet seems to be down for maintenance but the street faucet works.

two GTX285's each at ~58.55 MH/s
@_date: 2011-06-14 20:02:08
You mean like this: 
@_date: 2011-06-16 17:14:39
That will work but not on nvidia out of the box.  I've got an external harddrive ready to go for plug and play mining though.  Also worthy of mentioning is that it doesn't contain a wallet.dat.  It just connects to a pool as one of my workers.
@_date: 2013-03-27 20:46:09
If you don't have admin privs, it's probably not your computer and you shouldn't be mining on it.
@_date: 2013-03-29 19:15:04
Sounds like an awesome bonus
@_date: 2013-04-01 23:10:03
If you have 0, then it doesn't really affect you at the moment.  If you buy in or mine some coins or sell something though, it might.
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:01:34
In bitcoin-qt you can open the debug window, then the console tab.
After that type 'dumpprivkey &lt;address&gt;'
It'll give you your key that you can then import into another wallet using 'importprivkey &lt;key&gt;'

Fair enough, maybe do a tiered system though.
.5 BTC = 1 entry
1 BTC = 3 entries
1.5 BTC  = 5 entries

Send them a message.  Their customer support has been pretty good.  Make sure to reference and transaction info that you have.
@_date: 2013-04-23 20:30:54
The coins that I bought appreciated in value between when I purchased and when I received them.  So I'm happy with that as a bonus.
In the end, I bought them at a specific price with an agreed on time period before they'd be available and that was followed through with to the letter.  That's why I'm happy.  Sure, they could've just as easily depreciated in value, but it was still a clean transaction.
@_date: 2013-04-23 12:26:24

Ah crap, haven't used Multibit, didn't realize that they changed the wallet format.

Misleading title but I like the idea.  Thanks for the btc.

Never.  It's a currency.  Is it too late to invest in Euros?
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:18:04
Just need to sit and wait.  It'll get there eventually.
@_date: 2013-04-02 00:38:58
Are you updating prices with the market fluctuations?

Scanbook is an iphone app that will let you check the balance of an address by scanning a qr code.
@_date: 2013-04-21 15:47:27
Another option is to just throw it up on BitMit and see what happens
@_date: 2013-04-05 13:09:08
@_date: 2013-03-29 19:39:27
Thanks, I'll delete the post now.

Awesome edit!  haha
@_date: 2013-04-23 20:49:16
Are you talking about Mt Gox where you need to wait a week or more to be verified?  That'd take just as long as Coinbase.
In any case, I'm not day trading and I'm not in a rush.  I put in an order and got my coins.
I shared my experience and the website did as they said they would.  It was smooth and easy and hassle free.
@_date: 2013-04-23 20:38:16
If I was worried about ridiculous crashes and bubbles, I wouldn't have used Coinbase.  I'm aware that it takes several days to clear and of course I wouldn't be happy if it dropped to $15/btc, but that wouldn't have changed anything.
Person A asks Coinbase for 5BTC at 50USD/BTC.  Coinbase says it'll take a week.  Person A says ok.  1 week passes.  Person A has their coins.  The exchange rate at this point is irrevelant because the original deal was never contingent on it.
Don't put in what you can't risk because at this point it isn't stable.
@_date: 2013-04-30 01:58:29
I mentioned that they're off topic

@_date: 2013-03-31 14:46:16
You'd have to do it in chunks.  Under $10k per year.  As always, cash is king, but would you really want that much in cash?  That's asking for trouble as well...
@_date: 2013-04-23 00:55:54
Mine is still pending withe about 75 minutes left before it's due to complete.  Bought at around 65.

bitmit has amazon gift cards on it.
@_date: 2013-04-27 00:53:33
I posted about my experience with them the other day, 
@_date: 2013-04-21 18:24:23
Can you spend them on goods/services?  Yes.
Can you accept them as payment for goods/services? Yes.
Can you exchange them for USD/Euro/Yen? Yes.
Sounds like money to me.
@_date: 2013-04-09 12:30:00
It sounds like you're trying to be a day trader with no experience...  This usually ends badly.
Better idea, spend your BTC on something you'd like to buy or hold onto them on a paper wallet someplace.

They showed up, just took forever.  Phew.
@_date: 2013-04-05 16:36:54
Thanks!  Neat game.  Of course I lost though haha
@_date: 2013-05-10 15:33:01
In order to use a paper wallet, the keys must be imported into a client or website.  Once that's done, it no longer exists solely on paper and is no longer as secure as it once was.
You can continue to use the wallet, it just isn't "paper" anymore.

[Casascius]( has physical bitcoins available for sale.
@_date: 2013-04-21 15:24:39
If you make it a lower price point per ticket, you may attract more people.

You've been on reddit for a month.  No thanks.  But if you can prove trust somehow, I'd do it for $375.

Close any program that accesses your wallet.  Use PyWallet to dump your priv keys.  Import to blockchain.  Profit.
PyWallet can be found here: 
Run with ./pywallet.py --wallet=walletfile --dumpwallet

Not sure how long it's been around.  I've only known about it for a week or 2.  Seems really cool, but I haven't had a chance to play around with the multiplayer games yet.

What're you looking for and for what price?  I've got some
@_date: 2013-04-02 00:18:17
List them on an exchange or localbitcoins or buy things.
@_date: 2013-11-22 15:35:24
Search your old computer (or current one) for your wallet.dat file.  If you find that, you'll be able to get your coins.
@_date: 2013-04-23 17:21:07
I posted as a self post because I don't care about karma
@_date: 2013-03-29 01:44:52
A wallet is a wallet is a wallet.  If it's got your private keys in it, it's good for as long as the data is readable.
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:54:20
That file is where your keys are kept.  If you don't have it, then you're probably SOL unless you were mining as part of a group or through a site.  Then you'd need to remember login info.
@_date: 2013-04-23 13:41:00
They're cheap but slow.  Worked for me, but I wouldn't try to day trade there, haha.

How would you limit votes or stop people from voting continuously if the coins aren't actually spent?
@_date: 2013-03-18 22:56:35
For how much?
@_date: 2013-04-02 15:30:18
Give me 1000 and I'll tell you ;-)
@_date: 2013-04-06 01:08:16
Why? So you could have ~2 coins per month?
@_date: 2013-03-21 17:12:48
They showed up, just took forever.  Phew.
@_date: 2013-04-23 03:51:33
Went through just fine.  Takes forever to buy, but just sent from CoinBase to my wallet no problem.
@_date: 2013-04-02 00:29:07
I haven't used an exchange so I couldn't tell you, but hopefully somebody else will lend a hand.
@_date: 2013-04-02 01:07:33
Another good idea... done.

Time Machine may also help if you have it enabled.
@_date: 2013-04-01 22:49:32
Higher price = higher value of current coins = able to spend less for more

How many are you looking to buy and for how much?  I could be persuaded to part with some possibly.
@_date: 2013-04-04 03:08:06
If you can pull your wallet.dat file off the old hard drive, you have a chance.  Otherwise, you're SOL.

Very cool!  Can't wait to pay for dinner with some BTC!
@_date: 2013-04-23 21:12:38
Not sure.  I didn't try.  
Think of it like ordering a piece of gold online.  You pay and it will take X days to arrive on your doorstep.  Regardless of the value of gold, the quantity you purchased and what you paid remain the same, no matter how long the shipping takes.
@_date: 2013-04-24 11:45:12
Unsure, I haven't tried.
@_date: 2013-04-03 18:02:07
I've noticed that larger transactions with lower fees tend to take longer.  When fees are more proportional, they go faster.  I don't know why, just seems that way.
@_date: 2013-04-01 00:44:35
Where'd you read that?

You mean calculate the USD equivalent?  A bitcent is worth $1.52 right now so yea, I'd probably include them too.
@_date: 2013-03-28 01:28:13
Neat.  I'd like to see how high it'll get before a reset.
