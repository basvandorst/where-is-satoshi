Look at this asshole risking the fabric of the space time continuum for a bunch of bitcoins.

IMHO you should give your delayed customers a few mBTC to make up for the delivery problem when this is resolved. It will save your image going forward.

Those are great until Mr. Cascius decides to move to a nice warm island and import thousands of his clients' private keys into his own wallet.

Why does everyone trust this cascius guy?

Seems like you have wisdom. You should do a "Confessions of an early adopter" post. Tell us your journey and about manhood, morality, generosity, and existentialism n shitz.

suggestion: more average-joe cytopgraphy (constellations, word games, etc etc) and less cryptobin genesis block bitcoin computer knowledge. 
levels the playing field, still could be super intense.

Raising $300k for a 10% equity stake...so they have a $3 million valuation on a company that has no known revenue. Awesome just tell me where to send my BTC.

There is major incentive not to. As long as they can hand a withdrawal requester funds from their deposit inventory, the rest of the notional value can be utilized in other ways... Like an expensive yacht (Madoff), or a mortgage loan (Lehman Brothers). It works well until it doesn't

Sorry to hear. I've endured my share of financial loss in the past. One was catastrophic. Understand that in the grand scheme of your life, 30 BTC is meaningless. Even if it were 30,000 I'd tell you the same thing. The sunshine feels the same regardless of the digits in your bank account. But seriously, 30 BTC is equivalent to a nice laptop. You'll make that back. 
@_date: 2013-03-19 15:26:56
a million dollars per BTC aye? Funny who the billionaires of the world would be if that happened.

It would help if you sent out a tweet assuring everyone that those pending transactions WILL be handled at the price we paid in the near future.

Not if your wallet is stored online you're not

Not a peg. Maybe it will move to $1.20/mBTC, it's just more practical. 
@_date: 2013-03-21 19:39:15
Ask the keeper of your wallet. If that person isn't you, you may want to Google "bitcoin cold storage"

Imagine a bank that doesn't ask for any identification when you make a deposit, all you need is the account number. 
Your account number at that bank is the public key, and anyone can walk in and make a deposit, the number is no secret. 
That account number was generated by putting a very secret code into a special computerized washing machine that generated the public address. Only you know that secret code, and while you can put the secret code in the washing machine and get the public address, you can't put the public address in the washing machine and get the private key.
While you don't need the secret key to make a deposit, you need it to make a withdrawl. 
The best part is, you don't have to use the bank's computerized washing machine. You can download one, unplug your computer from the matrix, and churn a secret code into a public receiving address.

Since your order to coinbase doesn't directly go to an exchange, they are probably doing a ton of internal shuffling /hedging. Who knows, maybe they had a deficit and needed to refuel the coins that they had already "sold"

what if my pass phrase is: Edga!r Elephantus BirThday@ Sunday
I don't think anyone will guess that in perfect order. 
Encrypted wallet backup always seems less safe to me because a mishap in handling the software or files or computer data could lead to a loss, whereas this way I just need to remember a complex string of words. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 14:28:37
Deep insight, thanks
@_date: 2013-04-02 23:36:45
Wow thanks. That's extremely alarming. Even scarier, I imagine a view of the top. 01 percent would look the same as this. 
@_date: 2013-03-20 21:28:18
thank you!!! 
so, tldr
1. generate random private key using some kind of offline generator
2. generate account from that key
3. send coins to account generated in step 2, leaving private key offline

Even if you think cryptocurrency is the greatest innovation of our lifetime... Why bitcoins? A new and improved alternative could emerge out of MIT tomorrow.

You can naked short the same way you would with stocks, you just need to "borrow". Also, in a matter of time high frequency exploratory trading and faux momentum generator algos will get in on the unregulated action if they haven't already.

YES! All you have to do is get your "code" out of it's current location and to it's new location. We haven't found a way around the gravity part of the code (yet) but invented ways to push through the gravity code with incredible force, it just takes a few hours to get to the "carribean"

A Mt gox coupon is just a fiat iou. Who knows if they can cover the liabilities, as long as there's not a massive gox run.

So you could have a runaway BTC/Fiat rate and corresponding incentive to mine, and willingness to spend energy on mining....a vicious loop, a massive bubble. That will be fun.

Excuse the douchery, but...as a long time stock trader, be forewarned. Even when it seems you are making money out of thin air, it's not time to sit around watching a ticker. Even if you made a whopping $50k, that's peanuts. You want to be making a consistent 6-figures a year and no ticker-watching will get you there.

How do you deal with the unsatisfied human desire to create, to build, to add to society? To leave the world a better place than those before you? Do you do productive work outside of your day job? I am asking honestly, I  considered this career route but realized I'd be no different than a ticket scalper.
