There are still 11 million bitcoins already out there. The lack of supply you are talking about is akin to a drop in the ocean.

I imagine it's possible to calculate the number of CPUs that were hashing it over the course of that year, I just don't know where to start.
cpubenchmark.net is pretty good about listing historical CPU speeds.

For anyone that's curious, this a photoshop of an official BFL poster at the actual Bitcoin 2013 conference.

Hopefully this solution is as easily explained to the general public before the news-spinning-banksters take hold of the situation as use it as a reason to launch an attack.
It would be pretty hard to explain to the general public "I know you can't withdraw your money due to some technical glitch that will last weeks, but just trust me here, it will all work out soon!".
The situation would be very similar to Cyprus I imagine.

I really just want to know how many people mined the first 1.6 million bitcoins is all. Not saying they didn't deserve them.

I mean really, I would imagine some of their alumnus contributions are literally found inside the bitcoin code.

They say "eh" in Northern Ireland?

There was a cryptic post made by cavirtex.com in their news section a few weeks ago:




As seen in 
They didn't seem to give any explanation as to why their account was being shut down.
RBC is Canada's largest bank no matter how you look at it. And cavirtex is canada's largest exchange.
The UK has cracked down hard on deposits going into bitcoin exchanges, and as Canada still has the queen of england on our $20 bill I assume that we will follow suit.
**Stay strong and carry on** my fellow Canadians.

The hashing rate wouldn't drop instantly however is what tastycat is saying.

see for more mining info

Fees don't make the network move any faster, so adding fees doesn't really solve the problem.
So what if miners are making a few bitcents more to block hashed? They have no place to go and buy reputable ASICs now. There would be a huge incentive for miners to cash out and call it quits.

Don't forget on reddit!

The professor actually mentions "anonymous cash" in the second video. Could be talking about Bitcoin or Zerocoin I assume.
@_date: 2013-04-27 15:28:55
Do they really need to charge that much?

I would be one happy individual, I tell you what.

My question is: "how many people were mining the first 1.6 Million bitcoins".
I'm not saying it was right, wrong, easy or hard.

I would be without relatives whose computers I could not easily fix!
There's nothing I hate more than keeping track of 40+ screws every thanksgiving just to replace a hard drive.

The problem, as I see it, would be that blocks could no longer be mined. It could take hours to hash a single block if we were mining at 25% capacity. (Assuming 75% of our network power shriveled up and died overnight due to some unforeseeable circumstance.)

You can't mine gas on your computer!
Plus I heard that Satoshi was planning an around-the-world trip to promote Bitcoins. Could come in handy.

Good point!
