Good point. But then again. There seems to be somewhat of a limit to what people trade via localbitcoin etc. And if you're to move a very significant amount, you kind of need to know another whale, right?

But let imagine that Bitcoin doesn't manage to scale, and it gets slower and slower, and like civilwar like disagreement at the bitcoin camp. Maybe Litecoin could scale better, and be less "radical"...

We, of course all know that Satoshi is an Australian uni prof. with a hot temper ;)

Thanks a lot. It makes sense to call it dust. Thanks for the info. Cheers. I guess I'll delete this sub soon, now I got it sorted.

But can you trade bitcoin via them? Isn't that only private equity deals?

Haha. I think Satoshi would know how to go about with this without having to ask this subreddit ;)
@_date: 2016-08-15 21:54:41
Sure. Good joke
@_date: 2016-08-26 19:24:52
Would you mind to elaborate?

I guess I put it wrong then. But a better structure in terms of a greater ability to scale up the coin if necessary

You wouldn't happen to have a link to those statements on Twitter? So you're not long on Maidsafecoin?
@_date: 2016-08-14 18:56:57
Thanks. I will check it out.

This is so stupid. Because we all know they won't do anything about the financing of terrorism which is used via banks and tax havens, because that would force them to clean up in this whole tax havens mess which they won't. They won't hurt the financial elite. Besides much terrorism is financed by their "allies" in Saudi Arabia, Quatar etc. But they won't do shit about that either.

Monaco then. No income tax. No inheritance tax.

Sure. But what would the worst case scenario of that be? That both the original bitcoin blockchain, and the new one implode?

Very well written! Thanks for sharing!
