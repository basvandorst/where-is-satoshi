There were some negative and positive aspects to the whole experience. I will post all the details in the next few days, including the newspaper article. I will also post a link so you guys can send Earl Stewart some positive feedback for becoming the first Toyota dealership in the US to accept bitcoin!

Bitcoin at work in the real world!!

Yes, he is. Unfortunately the company is insolvent and therefore  Bitcoin will no longer exist tomorrow. It was a great bubble and Ponzi scheme while it lasted.

Great idea Andreas. Once again you represent the voice of reason in a sea of ignorance. I just sent $5.

Not sure I understand? I am not taking advice from anybody here. Just looking for opinions.

So this appears to be a much bigger problem than has been addressed in this forum. Bitcoin is supposed to be decentralized so that "trust" should not be an issue. Now we are back to third party intervention if I get into a dispute with my local grocery store?

I will post a photo of the car along with the photos that the Palm Beach Post took as soon as they are available.

OK, wow, I am new here, so I am overwhelmed. My first thoughts on all the comments:
Yes, bitcoin is about people more than anything else. I believe this is a cultural revolution so much more than the brilliance of the concept. I think the time is right. The only way this will succeed is with adoption. That will take time, just like it did with me.

Why do people hate miners? These are the people that maintain the network. Peer-to-Peer. Anybody remember Napster?

I had enough bitcoin but went ahead and purchased it back right away. That was part of the negative experience - having to pay Coinbase fees to purchase back my bitcoin.

How are the miners completely useless? They provide the backbone of infrastructure and should be rewarded for their efforts.

I walked in on the day they were setting things up so it took longer than expected. We are all learning how this works, but we believe in it!

Great post. I learned about bitcoin in October last year and a friend coached me through the basics. I started researching like crazy, almost every waking moment. The obsession almost made me sick. The concept was unlike anything I had seen before. I cashed out every investment I had and bought Bitcoin. Not only in the hope of making money, but believing in the greater concept. I don't care about the daily fluctuations in value. I have a new energy and a spring in my step. Going to work every day became so much easier. I really don't care if I lose all my money. I would be worth it if only for my change in energy and attitude. Bitcoin is an idea to be excited about in an otherwise boring technical innovation world. I have been around since the DOS prompt days and my gut told me that this is very real and very different to anything else we have seen in a long time.

These guys are totally open to the concept. The owner himself is the one who told his people to make it happen!

The US dollar is supposed to be back by the US government. If you took $1 to the Treasury today, they would tell you that you owe them $185.

True. Nothing is really "backed" any more.
