no, i mean that every transaction is a taxable transaction, not just in and out of USD.  Trade BTC to ETH?  Taxable transaction you need to determine the value of and pay tax on.  
I've dealt with my taxes on any conversions from crypto back to USD (very small profit this year)  Having to keep track of every single transaction, and the USD value of it at that time (for tax purposes) is going to be a bigger issue than most people realize.  You bought ETH with BTC Jan 9, then on Jan 11?  Two taxable events.
I honestly really do not think GOP had any clue what impact this change would have, but they changed the tax language disallowing "like kind" exchanges *except for real property*, which crypto is not.  I imagine it might have an impact on forex as well, but I'm not doing any explicit forex stuff right now, so am not concerned about it.

it's real.  simpsons called it 20 years ago.

yeah, cause over here in the good old USA all the gun nuts will go shoot up the IRS and Congress if they dare to mess with your investments, right?  W00t!  guns!
Oh... GOP just fucked over crypto investors with latest tax bill.  I don't see all those armed "investors" storming capitol hill to unfuck the situation.

i've never seen 'free' adoptions.   Every adoption event I've ever seen has a fee attached to it, presumably to keep freeloaders looking for abuse animals at bay.
Perhaps OP mentioned more here, but... just our local pet stores run adoption events seemingly weekly.  You still have to pay some money, then probably want to buy some equipment as well.  "Buying" the dog at a pet store could very well have been supporting an adoption through the local animal shelter - that's often how it's done around here.

You're generally not swapping, say, AAPL stock for IBM stock.  You sell AAPL - taxable event - then buy IBM.  
Any profit is capital gain.  How long you held the property (stock) before selling determines the rate at which the profit is taxed.
As it stands now, in 2018, if you buy BTC, then trade it for ETH, then trade for LTC, then trade for USD, you've had 3 taxable events which need to be reconciled.  
You buy $1000 of BTC on Jan 1.
Jan 5, you trade the BTC for ETH, but the BTC then had a value of $1050 USD, so you've 'made' $50.
Jan 9, you trade the ETH for LTC.  The ETH has a value of $1110.  You've "made" $60.
Jan 15 you trade the LTC for USD at $1160.  You've 'made' another $50.
You had a total of $160 in profit.  But... what it you never went back to USD.  If you just kept it in LTC.  You've still had $110 in 'profit' which you'll need to account for, which wasn't clearly the case up until this new tax bill.  The only property that qualifies for 'like kind exchanges' were modified to be 'real property'.  I'm predicting this is going to bite a whole lot of people in the butt next year, and possibly prompt some changes at the behest of some GOP donors who were heavy in to crypto :)

it only seems you can do ETH and BTC on gemini, not LTC, so it may not suit your needs.

i hope you meant for a comma to be in there some place...
