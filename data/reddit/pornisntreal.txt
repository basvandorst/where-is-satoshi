Sounds legit.

Lack of regulation is what scares me. Too much of the security of your account depends on the size of 256-bit numbers. I can't go around trying to initiate permanent wire transfers with random bank account numbers, ESPECIALLY not at the speed of a computer. I would like to see a 2-factor authentication build into the Bitcoin protocol. This would sell me on the long-term. 
Technology moves fast, hell at one point we couldn't imagine running out of IPv4 addresses. The possibility of stumbling upon a valid private key with funds is astronomical at the current time, but given the fact that we can cache a list of all accounts and their balances in a matter of seconds (given an initial conversion to database) - the only remaining factor is how fast we can generate hashes programatically, and convert them to addresses to check their validity. Hell, some of the ASICs developed for BTC mining are currently pumping out 68,000,000,000 hashes per second (and possibly up to 22x that much), where you'd be a lucky man to have 1/68th of that a year ago. This may not be a huge concern today, but it makes me concerned for the future.
Regardless of collisions/brute force attacks - if I were to somehow figure out your private key, I could take your money and you couldn't do anything about it. Where large companies (Sony and PSN for example) mess up and lose credit card information, it's a hassle - but the result is much less severe. Can you even imagine what would happen if large businesses started to tokenize private keys for recurring payments, and what the consequences would be if they made a mistake in their security precautions? Someone could walk away with millions, unscathed. And this hurts the consumers - it would be the death of Bitcoin - people will forget about the currency exchanges losing money, but lose $10,000 of your hard earned BTC? Never again.
I'm a fan of Bitcoin, but regulation isn't always a bad thing, and software is never flawless. This is a blackhat's heaven. Remember how rampant credit card theft used to be? The financial institutions adapted. How will Bitcoin address account security moving forward? I don't think any number of paper wallets or linux live CDs are going to cut it if BTC goes mainstream.

Which is for the courts to decide, not the banks.

Banking is regulated.
