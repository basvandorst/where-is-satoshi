I know not.
But couldn't you say the same about every single crypto currency payment system.

what you mean?

Everything's probably fine, things are just running a bit slow right now.

Where does this  limit come from?
Is this currently due to the 1MB block, ie n transactions per block,  + lack of majority node Segwit support?

Aye it's not clear.
Is OP suggesting that the Ledger/Trezor rely on the CPUs TPE to function safely and this exploit compromises hardware wallets?
Or is OP just concerned because it illustrates "hardware" isn't invulnerable?

To be honest it's really fucking difficult to know.
I joined Kraken on recommendations on here and elsewhere. :(
But I would say it's clear Kraken is not coping too well at the moment.

Been keeping an eye out for discounts (UK).
Can I ask folks opinion on buying these from 3rd party sellerr on Amazon?
I'm not sure you can be 100% sure it's not been tampered with, but on the other hand this link : 
Seems to say that the ledger is validated via the client software such that there is little or no risk?
I do also have this slight worry about everyone using the same hardware wallet means driver/ledger updates offer a huge target for exploitation.

Yes it seems to be a risk.
On the original point, you could verify the destination address on two different browsers.
I think this is probably worth the time to do if you're making a large transaction.
