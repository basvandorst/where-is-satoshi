It's sad that this fallacy could impact the success of a coin. The real unit people should be using is 10^-8 , or a satoshi. I think it's silly that a coin could be more successful because it has a circulation of 10^12 as opposed to 10^6.
Maybe the best circulation is 10^13, so that when the world is on the network, the value of a coin is about a buck.

Bitcoin's value isn't that it's money. Bitcoin's value is that it is a computer system which acts as an incorruptible shared database for the world. Perfect for representing objects which must be conserved, like money.
Shared databases for the world are new and exciting and we will continue to see more money dumped into altcoins provided that those altcoins have a useful shared database.
Blockchains are software, first and foremost. Money will converge to better software, and useless inventions like bitconnect will slowly disappear.

It looks like they have removed the step "send nearly costless transactions within minutes". 
Bitcoin: the next gold. You hodl it, but you don't really do much else with it.

False definition of hodl: Get and forget.
True definition of hodl: You're about sell, then you realize +20% is nothing and decide not to.

Manually send your coins to a wallet of your choosing. Exchange is solving a different problem. Currently, order book speeds require centralization.

Wrong question. The right question is "why the *fuck* are the fees for a volatile asset constant!?"
The answer is that it allows the exchange to effectively lock people into their crypto if and when the price plummets, allowing them to make more money. Efficiency for users means less money for centralized brokers.

If you mean what I think you mean, then it sounds like you missed my point. Who is Nick Szabo? Who is Satoshi? Who is Craig Wright? To paraphrase Marie Curie, why are we talking about men and not ideas?
That said, I'll humor you. Satoshi would probably be interested in Ethereum and several other technologies. Do you think Bohr went AFK on quantum mechanics just because Schrodinger developed the quantum equation of motion? No! Bohr realized his work was a precursor to something more powerful. I'm comparing Satoshi to Bohr, not because I think he is "wrong", but because I think he is brilliant.

Why are people asking why peopleWhoMightBeSatoshi don't admit they're Satoshi? 
*The whole point was to be anonymous*, as seen by the use of a pseudonym.
You ask why would the Bitcoin inventor(s) want(s) to be anonymous? Put yourself in Satoshi's shoes. You're inventing technology which undermines the very governments that control almost all aspects of your life. Why would you want to be identifiable? You are creating a weapon to be used against centralized power. Bitcoin and the very idea of bitcoin is a threat to anyone who has centralized power. 
If you run a big website, you should be scared of decentralization. If the N people who use your website can use a decentralized version which is run entirely by them, why would they need you? Bi
Do you think Wikileaks would even function properly unless they had guaranteed leak anonymity? People like Satoshi are rightfully afraid of the government and the other incumbents. 
 Satoshi alone. It is not in our interest to identify him right now.
When the people run everything, when centralized powers no longer have a competitive edge, he will be identified because he will have nothing to fear. Until then, Satoshi (if he's alive) is scared shitless. He doesn't need weaponized autism trying to out him. 
 work for the governments, work for Satoshi. Satoshi doesn't want them to know who he is right now.
