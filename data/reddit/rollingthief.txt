I‘d consider it if my internet wasn‘t so damn slow :/

I know I shouldn't be laughing, but damn...

We're not even close to mainstream yet, but I'd say mass adoption is starting! :D
@_date: 2018-09-14 06:15:35
You do know how supply and demand works, right?

Sheeps need to stop buying overpriced products so that everyone can get somewhat reasonably priced products..
@_date: 2018-09-12 20:57:32
Still pretty bad if you ask me haha. I like Apple in general but they are going nuts with their prices. It's a joke at this point.

Damn what a great video. I actually learned so much! Thank you for creating it! 
@_date: 2018-09-27 12:29:21
Hard to do so if it never lost it's greatness. ;-)

You should‘ve inspected the can at the very bottom

Damn that‘s pretty cool!

Entry comment. I like crypto pro so far.
@_date: 2018-10-27 23:27:55
This is, by far, the worst and most wrong use of a meme, ever. 
@_date: 2019-11-26 13:13:43
Well you have to send fiat from your main bank account to your Fidor account but once that‘s through and you are verified on bitcoin(.)de you‘re good to go. There are certain limits on how much you can buy per day but once you do a few transactions you should rise in the so called  Trust Level rather quickly. 
After you purchase bitcoin you will be able to access them in your bitcoin(.)de wallet and from there you can send them to whereever you want. 
I think one of the biggest differences is that you buy and sell from other people through bitcoin(.)de

But if mining isn‘t illegal in your country, there‘s no need to use of the grid power. And if it is illegal in let‘s say 90% of all countries, people WILL start using other ways to keep mining and stay under the radar. 
@_date: 2019-11-26 13:04:44
I only use bitcoin(.)de
I think it‘s really good. You may consider using it with a bank account at Fidor Bank to enable Express Trading for instant transactions. I don‘t have anything negative to say about the site.
@_date: 2018-10-14 02:19:12
Why would you need the network to also run off of let‘s say generators? 
@_date: 2018-10-02 19:48:45

Jay (guy in the picture) offered free breast examinations to all girls in his class. He even offered to pay for it (in Bitcoin). 
@_date: 2018-10-14 03:14:26
True but even with no money to be made, some true believers would still mine I think. At this point ( and we‘re talking worst case here) we‘ll probably be down in difficulty like in the early days. 
@_date: 2018-10-12 10:53:56
As it should be :) 
@_date: 2018-10-14 03:11:54
Yeah overall you can‘t really stop mining since people will always find a way to do it anyway. :) 
@_date: 2018-10-03 00:47:44
You could try [Codecademy]( or download the iOS/Android app "Learn Python" from Sololearn which is quite nice. This might also help [Python Tutorial]( And for a little bonus check out the current [Humble Bundle]( there are books available for cheap on how to learn Python! Hope this helps!
@_date: 2018-10-04 06:53:32
That's about when I started buying too. Fortunately I didn't have any money left to buy in december 17 haha.
@_date: 2018-10-03 23:56:08
Not that late to be honest. Hope you didn‘t buy in december though. 
@_date: 2018-10-14 03:19:25
Indeed dude, indeed. What a time to be alive! :)

Check out r/BitcoinBeginners for questions like this. This sub is for news and discussions mainly.
@_date: 2018-10-16 20:49:57
I'll remind you.
@_date: 2018-10-03 23:43:21
According to your username, you are not :D
@_date: 2018-10-13 20:17:21
Sorry if this is a stupid question but wouldn't it be possible to get a power generator and use that electricity for mining? That way your traceable power usage wouldn't be increased, right? 
@_date: 2018-06-23 22:53:35
Good. Anyone who calls Roger Ver "Bitcoin Jesus" should shut the fuck up about it anyway.
@_date: 2018-06-14 00:18:40
Hey I really like the idea. I would love to sell some Gamekeys on there! Any chance this will be possible in the future? :)
@_date: 2018-06-21 21:21:28
As a german, I can only hope it stays this way. Germany tends to make shitty decisions when it comes to digital stuff...
@_date: 2018-10-14 02:48:51
Yeah that‘s the point I was trying to make. Mining with energy from a generator would take you off the grid. Though this only works until they look for increased fuel purchases instead of electrical bills. 
@_date: 2018-06-17 22:05:39
Pretty new site just got in beta I believe  
I tested the site with a friend of mine and it worked. If you want to buy any Humble Bundle Games with bitcoin, just tell me :) I will gladly put them in my Coinmall shop for you :D

Quality shitpost. 
@_date: 2019-01-12 18:52:54
It's like looking at buying bitcoin as a donation to the network instead of an investment. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:32:53
How do you invest in Bitcoin in 2013 and sell at a loss? Did they hodl for only one day? lol

The "submit request" button in the "request a bank" section doesn't seem to work.

Does the legacy adress get converted or how does this work? 
@_date: 2017-10-01 15:07:28
Hm okay thank you. I guess the best way to understand it is to just try it out. :)
@_date: 2017-10-01 13:45:35
I do have a breadwallet but I still don't understand how I can get the private key after I buy Bitcoin online. Can someone explain to me?
@_date: 2018-07-19 16:12:09
Wow I never would've expected germany to be ne number 2 country when it comes to bitcoin nodes. 
@_date: 2018-07-02 22:04:06
@_date: 2017-10-01 15:00:06
Okay but let's say I buy some bitcoin for 50$ or so from Kraken. After the purchase I send them to my breadwallet. But now I still don't own the "private key" everybody is talking about. I hear all the time " Don't keep your private keys on exchanges" and I don't really understand what people mean by that. 
@_date: 2018-07-21 00:57:10
Wow this is exactly enough for one pizza.
@_date: 2018-07-19 16:09:01
If I would've been responsible when I invested in bitcoin, I would have regretted it hard, for sure. I am young and that's why "everything" IS, in fact, what I can afford to lose so I guess I kind of stuck to that rule on my own terms.  If shit went south I would have lost my savings which most people I know at my age don't have anyway and they manage to survive as well.
I only know that in a few years I will look back and I will know if this was the smartest move I've ever made, or the dumbest.
@_date: 2018-07-23 17:30:02
50k is not much for you? Damn where do you live?
@_date: 2018-07-19 23:54:18
Good to hear I am not alone with that haha 
@_date: 2018-04-18 20:55:20
Currently 78% to 22% for one and only Bitcoin. :-)))
