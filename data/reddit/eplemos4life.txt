Then you sell 15% of what you have 1 month before.
If the risk of that event happening based on a typo (0,00005%) will make you hella Rich.

Not selling at 12k
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:28:49
It is not. This is what i am trying to tell you.
It did before but its removed. So the 12 of dec i searched it up on blockchain info for the first time because back then i could still see the adresses and amount i sent on my nano.
But now its gone in my nano, but i found the history in my webbrowser history from when i searched up the adresses back on 12 of dec.

Nano ledger software didnt update after the transaction got stuck. Even if i clicked the "refresh" button. So I uinstalled and installed software again.
The best tech solution throughout the times of man: unplug and plug it in again. :D

Ok let me give you and example of how it looks like (numbers are only for an example, not real value):
0.001+ (green)
0.001+ (green)
0.001+ (green)
0.001- (red)
0.001+ (green)
Total balance should be 0.003 btc (as suggested from deposits and withdrawels). But my problems its not like this. My balance is more like 0.002.
So basically when i check all transactions from and to my ledger wallet the numbers dont add up. My balance should have been higher.
I hope you understand what i try to express.
@_date: 2019-07-17 14:18:26
Haha, yah
Bitcoin today also identifies as a 1 000 000 000 $ asset, we should treat it as that.
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:40:34
It was a nano ledger software bug I think. I tryed the easiest solution which was so unintall and reinstall the chrome os bitcoin ledger wallet application.
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:22:39
How? The transaction is not showing on the nano.
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:50:38
So if i have another ledger i should try and set it up with the same words I i used on the first? So that hopefully i get the real balance?
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:36:49
No, problems still stands.BTC balance is wrong on the nano ledger and the TX history is missing from the nano.
BTC is stuck in a "un confirmed" transaction. The amount of BTC stuck is the amout sent + the amount that was form a previous succesfull TX deposit the the ledger.
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:39:50
PROBLEM FIXED.
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:29:14
Thats the issue. 
It showed earlier (as the red numbers for withdrawels from your nano). But now its not listed at all. As if it never happend.
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:09:05
OK! I went through my browser history and luckily found when i check earlier on blockchain info. And it the numbers match! So what can I do? Says the amout of BTC and also "Unconfirmed transaction".
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:51:00
Thank you man. I appreciate your help.
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:38:54
Its solved. Thanks for trying to help.
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:18:47
Ye I would like to have that feeling.
But i set the fee to really low just to test it. I think 2 satoshi something pr. byte just to test how long it would take with this low fee. I mean... will this ever go through with this small fee? Is there a way i can redeem it or speed up the fee so that i can get the btc in my control again?

List of countries experiencing hyper inflation:

List of EU countries with debt to shitshow italy:
List of countries with increasing uncertanty due to tradewars:
UK (Also brexit)
Italys inability to pay their debt will be the nail the coffin for Deutsche Bank, letting that house og cards come crashing down taking out trust in EU and collapse it.

Selling to pay of your mortgage is good, but the market doesnt care and you have to accept the fact that you could have gotten more profit out of holding it for 5 more years and just sustained the mortgage payments with Fiat.

Less dump from miners, takes less money to move it up. 
Chances of higher prices after halving is what all smart money is basing their investments thesis on

This MA can be higher than current prices IMO. So average in is best DCA satoshis
