This is awesome.  I have three goats and a few months ago was seriously looking at building one. How much would shipping to New Zealand be?

Aaaand it's gone.

Yeah, looks damn near impossible without an android device.  This seems a very practical example on why to use a backup format usable by all clients.

I can empirically confirm this.
I use a different email address for everything, and this was sent to localbitcoins which is only used on localbitcoins. I also don't have a coinbase account.

I used localbitcoins.com - set up a deal with a seller with good feedback and deposited cash over the counter directly into their account.  You could then move the BTC to Mt Gox

Yes, should be totally fine.  Some engravers have a cache in them which could be a problem.

It *IS* possible for two people to generate the same key, but very very very improbable.

That's not a Raspberry Pi - The pi doesn't have VGA or a DB9 serial port on it.

I used a piece of a heat dissipation plate from an old computer.  The piece I used was ~~65x55mm~~ 60x66mm and about 2mm thick.  Any thinnner and the punches would show through the plate
Edit: Copper has a gravity of 8.930, so my piece of copper must be about 71g (2.3 oz t).

Yes, but it is higher than paper.
Copper was chosen as it's soft enough to stamp easily and I had some lying around.
Copper is around 3 on the Mohs hardness scale.
Stainless Steel may be more suitable, it's around 6 on the hardness scale and has a ~40% higher melting point of 2,750°F (1,510°C)

Minor, but will it reduce the time to search the entire keyspace. Yes!
@_date: 2013-03-27 20:59:58
Any time the key is printed, laser etched, etc, there is a chance for the key to be stored in cache.

I call shenanigans on this.
The checksum is the first four bytes of a SHA256 hash.
You have a 1 in 4294967296 chance of a typo being accepted as a valid address.
Unless you generated the address from the wrong 256 bit public key - Then you have a 100% chance of a typo being accepted.
Edit: If in fact you did a typo in the  public address, please post the address it should have been and the address it was sent to - this could be a serious security problem.

The diehard battery tests can check that the output is uniformly random. Your comment describes exactly what I was thinking.
@_date: 2013-03-28 02:44:08
Thanks, never used bitcointip before
@_date: 2013-03-28 02:33:22
Understood.  I actually used a Sparkfun Geiger counter.  They have a built in RNG which was connected to my offline computer via a serial port.
@_date: 2013-02-27 06:53:29
Apologies. My bad.

Take a piece of soft metal and stamp it with 64 Hexadecimal (0-9, A-F) characters. 
Save a copy of bitaddress.org to a USB stick and boot up a computer using a live CD.
Open the saved file of bitaddress.org, go to the "Wallet Details" tab and very carefully enter the 64 hexadecimal characters into the "Enter Private Key (any format)" box and then click "View Details".
Provided you've entered the HEX private key correctly, you will now get the bitcoin address. Copy the bitcoin address to a USB stick, or if you're super paranoid, photograph just the bitcoin Address (or write it down) so there is no chance of that private key making it onto any storage medium other than the copper plate.
Congrats, you just stamped a 256 bit private key into a piece of metal and generated the public bitcoin address from it.
Edit: No, I'm not going to provide pictures of the completed wallet.
@_date: 2013-03-27 21:10:39
I liked the idea of using a 64 character Hex key as it can be anything.
I just picked up the punches 'randomly' and hammered out the 256 bit key
@_date: 2013-03-28 02:56:51
If you're coming to steal them off me, just the one bitcoin.

Spread your risk...

Do you have a source for this? I really thought this was unproven
