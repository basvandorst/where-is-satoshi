That was actually the idea i had in mind when I bought titcoins.com, but I haven't had any time to bring it to fruition.

Somewhat unrelated: I own titcoins.com and I don't actually have time at the moment to do anything with it; I'd be willing to sell it to somebody but I don't know the first thing about domain transfers.

This might not be the place for this, but I own the domain titcoins.com and I am looking to sell it.  Found a buyer in late 2011 but that ended up falling through.
Accept Dwolla or BTC, send me a message if you're interested!

Yep, have my hacker vault full of hacker currency that I got when I started my hacker job after graduating from hacker school.  My first hacker interview was a pain, but I got the hacker job and my hacker boss is pretty nice.
In our hacker free-time we like to spend our hacker currency on hacker drugs and hacker guns to make a hacker statement about our nation.  Our hacker statement isn't profound or anything, it's just flagrant rebellion for the sake of "haw haw look what I can do because I'm a hacker."

Hahaha, I'm the guy who owns titcoins.com (but only for a couple more hours)

I don't know about you guys, but in the summer, our electricity costs go up.  Not just electricity consumed, but also $/kwh.
Now, I know this current shift is a little too abrupt to account entirely for seasonal electricity costs, but I'm sure the additional cost of mining is probably putting some upward pressure on the price.

The post that the article references is here:   
I think it's important to note that people themselves do not fall into one of these two categories.  *I am going to attempt a TL;DR reduction of the article, but it will still be TL for some people.*  The author writes:


He goes on to explain that, essentially, society has conditioned us to focus more on action than on thinking, and as a result, our knowledge packets are "stacked" rather than "mapped to one another."
In the context of software development, the author argues that the best software developers are mappers, because they see how every piece of the system relates to every other part, and then can reduce these parts into an elegant solution.  Somebody who just stacks his knowledge packets (a packer) will try to brute-force code every object into the code and tie them together haphazardly, with no regard for an elegant solution.  This is why, the author argues, some software developers are more effective than others -- because they take the time to think about everything they do, rather than just try and *do* things.
With all of this in mind, I think the point the author of the bitcoin article is trying to make is that if an introspective person who is used to mapping bits of knowledge together (a mapper) researched economics, currency, software development, and cryptography, and then proceeded to ask the question "what is the most elegant solution to the future of economics," it would mapper-reduce into Bitcoin.  That is why some packers, who haven't mapped out the knowledge packets that go into the bitcoin system, are wary of it; they are looking at what bitcoin *does,* and not what bitcoin *is,* and because they can't understand it fully by looking at what it does, they are afraid of it.
I'm sure many of you, like me, clicked through to the article because you didn't want to be classified as ignorant due to some genetically predetermined category you fall into.  Don't worry -- if you've made it this far, or if you've popped open the article, it's clear that you're interested in the acquisition of knowledge.  As long as you don't disregard this knowledge when you take action, you're most certainly a mapper.

Make sure you get an ATI brand video card.  The reason is because ATI cards are better at integer operations, and Nivida cards are better at floating point operations.  Mining relies heavily on integer operations, which ATI card excel at.

I was under the impression that if you had a 6-series card, you needed to use 2.4, but I could very well be wrong.
Also, i just updated poclbm and now i'm back down to 377 despite the fact that the updated miner included the change =/

I hadn't even heard about Solidcoins until Ruxum emailed me.  My research lead me to the following sites:

As an aside, I have a couple ruxum beta invites left if anybody is interested in checking the site out.

I haven't read a bad Stephenson book yet.  Call me a noob, but I left the last 40 or so pages of Diamond Age unread because I didn't want it to end :P

While it might not be profitable *at this point in time* to mine, in most cases you're not going to be selling bitcoins the second you earn them, right?
So whether or not your mining endeavor is "profitable" depends on the price of bitcoins when you sell them, which is impossible to predict.
Just because your mining "is not profitable" based on the current US/BTC exchange rate and the cost of electricity, the real profitability of your mining endeavor depends on the US/BTC exchange rate when you decide to go back to USD.
I know a lot of casual miners (such as myself) are mining just to have the bitcoins.  If I want to "actually make money" (that is, grow an investment of USD), I throw my USD into the stock market.
The reason I mine is to have the bitcoins, and I write the cost of electricity off as a sunk cost as part of my foray into digital currency :)

Aside from attack in the virtual world, you need to protect yourself against real-life threats as well.  What if your house burns down?  Even if you keep your wallet on another machine or have a CD-burning backup routine, you risk losing all your coins.
Encryption and uploading to "the cloud" is great, but it still doesn't save you if your house burns down, because you've just also lost your private key, so you'll never be able to decrypt your wallet.
I know this goes against the notion of complete and total security, but my recommendation would be, in addition to encrypting your wallet, export your keyring and encrypt it with two keys: yours, and the one of someone you trust with your life.  Someone like your mom or dad who would never want to screw you over.  If your house burns down, then that person can use their key to decrypt your keyring for you when you rebuild, and you will in turn gain access to your wallet again.
I know giving somebody access to your public key is probably one of the worst security-related things you can do from a purely philosophical standpoint, but as long as you truly trust the person (and perhaps keep your encrypted keyring someplace different from your encrypted wallet), I think it's the only way to really protect yourself from physical disasters as well.

Unless you're investing 100k into ASIC-based mining, I'm going to say electricity is going to make your endeavor unprofitable.  And by "invest," i mean "research, develop, and produce."

Yeah, the author's opinion that the US government is going to "take down" bitcoin seemed to come out of nowhere and has no real grounding.

derp, i wonder what?  Running in ubuntu using poclbm.  Using 2.4 SDK.  I have a buddy with the same setup who gets the same rates.

Took my 6970 from 373 to 386 for a 3.4% increase!  Thanks!
FYI:  Clock is running at 900mhz, memory underclocked to 800mhz, voltage is unchanged, use the following args with poclbm: -f2 -v -w128

TL;DR: 
"First, let's talk about what bitcoin is.  Bitcoin is a currency that is dead.  Now let's talk about GoldMoney, a company I invest in.  Wow, this is *amazing!*  I can't believe how great this company I have a financial interest in is.  I would like to encourage readers to consider abandoning bitcoin for this other currency that I invest in.  Please listen while we circlejerk about my new currency for the rest of the interview!"

The headline is misleading.  The real meat of the article is, "Hey, we've got an instant money transfer service on the way!"
