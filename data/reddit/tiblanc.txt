A LN channel with a balance under the current on-chain fee is unspendable because nobody would want to accept tokens they can't settle on chain. Either way the coins are unspendable.

BCH isn't optimizing anything because it's not needed. So what's the point of LN if it's not about optimizing a resource used by BTC? The only reason other than hardware cost is tx fees, but that means a less secure blockchain as I demonstrated. 
You must not know what leverage is. Leverage allows a multiplication of an underlying resource, but it needs to reconcile with the underlying at some point. Leverage pushed to extremes create a tail wagging the dog situation and if deleverage is impossible, it causes a snowballing effect that completely destroys the underlying. Read about 1987 market crash or debt based fiat currencies to see it in action. That's where hyperinflation comes from.

Difference between and is here posts get deleted while on posts get downvoted, but you can still read them if you're interested. So let's test the theory by crossposting shall we?
Let's assume BTC and BCH are both priced the same because when crypto takes over the world, USD won't matter. Assume 1 satoshi is 1 USD if that can help you. Let's also set the chain security level to the same cost, which means equal hashpower.
The BTC strategy is to open channels and do transactions off-chain. Let's say 10 transactions per day. How often are channels opened and closed? Every month? So let's say 1500 bytes for the round trip, we're going to fill a block with 1400 round trips. 4320 blocks in a month, 6M users. 10 transactions per day per user means 416K transactions per 10 minutes. Not bad, not bad...
Let's assume 1 sat/byte for BTC without fee market, because that's the BCH standard right now. I'm going to set LN transaction fees to 0.1 satoshi per tx. For each user, the fees to use BTC+LN is 1500 satoshis + 30 satoshis per month for 300 LN transactions.
With 2MB blocks, assuming 1 sat/byte, we're at about 2M satoshis of fees per block. I'm being generous here to lower your fees even more. This gives us PoW security of whatever electricity 2M satoshis can buy.
So now let's reverse it all for BCH. We want the same on-chain security, but we are also going to do 416K transactions per block. That's 262 bytes per on-chain transaction which means about 109MB blocks. We need 2M satoshis as total transaction fees, which means 0.0183 satoshis per byte. 262 bytes per transaction means, on average, 4.807 satoshis per transaction. 300 transactions per month means 1442 satoshis per month in fees to use BCH.
Wait it's the same? Of course, it's the same because I set PoW at the same level which means the fee per transaction is the same. Actually, on-chain is cheaper because you don't pay a middleman that doesn't provide security. So what was the point? The point was to demonstrate that numbers can be twisted to mean whatever you want them to mean. Here, I decided that on-chain security was the same in both scenarios.
You can twist the numbers in favor of BTC by doing an enormous amount of transactions on LN and maintaining BCH fees at 1 sat/byte.
You can twist the numbers in favor of BCH by invoking the 2017 fee market with 1000 sat/byte. 1.5M satoshis to round-trip a channel can buy you 5725 BCH transactions at 1 sat/byte.
What matters is LN reworks the Level 1 on-chain capacity problem by trading storage costs for complexity, bandwidth, processing power and security. BCH says storage costs is the lowest and it's not what should be optimized. LN might work fine now, but it's a leveraged instrument and when a leveraged instrument deleverages, you get the biggest denial of service possible and the whole thing comes crashing down.
@_date: 2019-11-30 23:14:04
You say that as if it's fact. I'm not sure if the scam is BCH keeping the Bitcoin name or Blockstream convincing everyone on-chain scaling is impossible to push everyone on their off-chain solutions.

Bitcoin is backed by the ability to write transactions on a distributed permissionless ledger secured by a given amount of burned energy.
USD is backed by the ability to pay speeding tickets, among other things.
In both cases, you're trading a large quantity of tokens that will never realistically be used for what they can actually be used for.

@_date: 2019-11-30 02:21:39
That's your opinion, not a fact.
Here are facts. They both aim to scale on-chain with volume providing fees while BTC aims to scale off-chain with a fee market. BSV wants to lock the protocol while BCH upgrades the protocol to add scripting capabilities. There is no redundancy other than the PoW algorithm.

Why would it remain sub-30? Lost coins remove liquidity from markets which accelerates the drop to 0 because of a shallower order book. Having coins outside of markets don't give it magical value.
The irrelevant forks of Bitcoin don't matter because security is a property of the chain. With little to no security, maximum transaction value is  low which limits chain usage to less than microtransactions. The reason why BCH and BSV are still relevant is because of this network effect. Low value transactions are better on these 2 chains, but high value transactions require too many confirmations to be usable. BTC is better for that transaction class due to its higher security.

They have it in other assets for the most part and use cash as a bridge for transactions. World's total wealth can be much higher than world's currency total value.

Every coin is a ticking time bomb with their low probability apocalyptic event. In that sense, none of them has a future. BTC's is the fee spike and LN channel closure cascade. That doesn't mean it's worthless. Every coin is better at some usage. Some of them depend on market conditions, while others depend on protocol features. Alts are cryptocurrencies' lifeboat in case BTC fails at implementing the decentralized permissionless ledger feature.

Again this is your opinion. You take the hashpower risk and replace it by a certainty. If there was any incentive to attack BCH, it would have happened a long time ago and it would be dead. Why isn't it the case if it's such a useless coin? Short it and kill it, there's millions to be made.
Blockstream has always held the narrative that hardforks are evil. To raise the blocksize, they will have to hardfork because the original client will no longer accept the new blocks. This is why SegWit was a softfork. I do not know if blocks will be increased or not. So far, the road map is 1MB forever. That's a fact. Not raising the cap forever is my opinion and we don't have to agree.
Here's some more facts. RV did not create BCH. Amaury Sechet created the ABC client and forked off BTC, then RV joined BCH well after the fork when it aligned with his views. RV is a loud mouth jerk in debates and does not control BCH. He only defends it, as do hundreds of others.

It doesn't matter if it was wasted in the first place. Markets will adjust so there is pure waste equal to block rewards. If you only mine to heat houses in winter, for example, it reduces the effective cost of mining and allows more houses to jump in than what the non-heating scenario would allow until there's break even. It's a lagging process like you say, but it's there.
@_date: 2019-10-17 19:42:52
I'm sorry but price does not magically rise over what you would expect from the buying/supply ratio. Reduce supply by half and price doubles. If you want much higher price, you need to increase incoming fiat. Previous major increases in price were due to milestones in adoption and awareness.

We'll see about that in 2021. I can name other factors than a halving 1 year prior to the bull run, so I remain skeptical.
My biggest concern is the amount of energy that will get burnt if we do have a bull run in the 50K-100K range. That would be around 500TWh per year out of a worldwide production of 25~30000TWh. It's unsustainable and would be a political disaster.
@_date: 2019-10-18 16:22:04
Nope. Mining will increase its energy consumption until it reaches break even. If these miners cost a lot, then it may reduce consumption a little bit as the cost is amortized over its planned lifetime, but it won't consume less resources overall.

It's simple. You send BTC to some address in exchange of an IOU. You later receive BTC and give back the IOU to the borrower.
What if you can't find a borrower?
You go to an IOU trading firm that will give you an IOU in exchange of your BTC. They will then find a borrower and give them BTC in exchange of another IOU. The borrower has BTC, the firm has an IOU and you have an IOU from the firm. You could give that IOU to other people, but you won't be able to use it to do an on-chain transaction.
In other words, through a bank.

Price increased back in 2014 and there still plenty of posts about advancement in tech and adoption. We're in the 2015-2016 era again so the lambos are totally different from that era.
I see reports of bans both ways so I don't care if you got banned for using price ratio as your main argument. I'm not paid by anyone. I have both coins and I see advantages to both of them. Some are tech based, some are market based. I'm not in it to play cheerleader.
If you must absolutely segregate people into 2 camps, feel free to lump me with the other ones even though I can come up with many ways it could fail. My views change over time and I live well with it. I used to think BCH was dumb and LN would save the world, until I researched it. As I said, I dig into whatever new information I find.

@_date: 2019-04-08 16:36:56
Similar enough doesn't make it apply.
In tragedy of the commons, the common good is totally free and increased usage does not cause increase cost to the user. Increased usage does not increase your cost, but causes a cost to the community. This means you increase your profitability at the expense of everyone else.
With limited block space, you'll have to increase your fees to use limited space which means increasing your usage cost. Your profitability is directly tied to your block usage. The community's profitability is also tied to it, but it's not free.

Ok that's where we misunderstood. Nobody owes you anything, but the gold nugget does. Legally you can't have an inanimate object owe something which is a funky statement for sure. It's still a future value of the gold nugget to be used as raw material for jewelry though and that fits the debt definition perfectly. 
My original point was that choosing to abolish a form of debt by using another form was a silly statement. Because debt is often misused does not warrant banning it altogether. I showed how, at the core, bitcoin and bank lending have the same properties.

Holding reduces liquidity. Low liquidity increases volatility.
If everyone holds BTC, there will be so little float that a tiny amount of money will cause the price to soar, creating imaginary gains. The opposite is also true, a tiny amount of money can crash the price, deleting imaginary gains.
XRP is a good case study for this phenomenom. A small percentage is in circulation and it looks like the currency had massive gains, but a small amount of selling crashed the price.
An asset with high volatility has lower value because investors are at higher risk of an exit rush.

Don't forget the legacy financial system. In 2017 we got futures. That's a big requirement for businesses to start accepting Bitcoin as it allows them to hedge the risk. They use this technique when budgeting expenses in a different currency than revenue.
With futures, the next step is mainstream tools from banks and the like. Average Joe has no interest in being his own bank. If the futures market is liquid enough, banks can hop in and offer a Bitcoin denominated account to their customers.

A debt isn't necessarily paid back in whatever you paid it for.
@_date: 2019-04-12 19:39:32
BTC is a form of debt. Actually, everything is a form of debt. A loan is a debt that promises to pay you more in the future, just like a stock is a debt on future revenue streams of a company. Buying a hamburger is buying a future source of nutrient. Buying a house is buying a future source of shelter. BTC is a debt because it is expected to have future tradeable value for other forms of debt. The most stable and easily tradable form of debt is what we call a currency.
So by hoarding BTC, you're actually hoarding debt. If the coin crashes and burn, your BTC is as worthless than if your loan counterparty declares bankruptcy.
Even if you were to live in a loan-less society, your daily activities would be about buying debt and transforming it into higher yield debt. Loans only make this process more efficient.
@_date: 2019-04-13 01:17:24
The definition of debt is something, typically money, that is owed or due.
Bitcoins can be redeemed for storage space on a distributed permissionless immutable database. That fits the debt definition perfectly. This feature is what sustains the ecosystem, just like a bar of gold can be transformed into jewelry or computer hardware.
If you stop thinking of debt as money only, you'll realize that everything of value has a redeemable feature and are interchangeable with each other. Money emerges as the one thing that has the most stable utility and easiest to transfer ownership. 
Bitcoin isn't money because it has coin in the name. It is money because it has that intrinsic value of buying storage space and this debt is more favorable to other debts.

Can you please explain how you are going to maintain the LN's realtime state with less computing power than a blockchain with 1GB blocks?
Decentralization is higher if the entire service offer can be maintained on a lower resource machine. Sure, you can host a BTC node on a lower resource machine. If you can't maintain LN's state on that machine, you have to use a 3rd party that can route your payments through their higher fees channels without your consent.
@_date: 2019-04-13 19:13:44
It has the same properties. You invest resources now for an IOU that carries a default risk. If the chain dies or your output is rollbacked, it is the same as a default because you can no longer redeem the token for its intrinsic value. Exactly as if your borrower went broke.
If that isn't correct, please explain the difference?

If an alt chain pegged to BTC is used to store microtransactions and uses a BTC transaction to secure it, it shares the same properties as the Lightning Network :
\- Low value transactions are not saved on the main chain
\- Money can flow back and forth any number of times without paying on-chain fees
\- Getting on board means getting IOU tokens for the main chain at a dual transaction fee cost to get on and off the system
How is VeriBlock any worse than Lightning Network channels in wasting on-chain space for cash transactions?
@_date: 2019-04-05 18:22:59
That article may be a fine overview for someone without network or data structure knowledge, but it's missing major parts.
Yes, LN being unicast is awesome because you reduce network load. The problem is how do you know who to connect to? You are not born with that knowledge, you need to acquire it. You can either know the entire network topology and plot your path or you can ask your connected nodes if they know your target node.
If you go with the first approach, you need to be notified of every change of state in the network as it happens or you might have routing errors. This is essentially broadcasting.
If you go with the second approach, you need a discovery algorithm that propagates through the network, trying to find a valid path to the destination. This is like pathfinding algorithms, except you have no cancel mechanism. If you find a valid path, the requests you already sent will have to timeout or return another valid path, which means you're effectively spamming the network with no ways to stop it. Worse still, if you connect to B and C and they both connect to D, D will end up processing 2 path discovery requests which is essentially the same request. This can grow exponentially if D has 2 paths to another node. This is not broadcasting, but you're going to cause a lot of work for your peers.
Compare that to an on-chain transaction where you broadcast a 500 bytes block of data once to everyone.
So yes, LN will reduce global transaction network usage, but it comes at the cost of path discovery. You're merely moving the problem to a prior step and claim it doesn't exist.
The internet doesn't know where to send packets based on an IP address. All it knows is MAC addresses. It works because centralized routers agree with each other that this range of address goes through that wire and that other range goes through that other wire. LN wants to replicate that in a distributed way, without trust. This is a problem engineers have been unable to solve for decades.
@_date: 2019-04-26 14:41:34
Like you say, these are incompatible long term goals. You're going to need L3(banks) on top of LN on top of blockchain. There's no way around it with the current blocksize and today users are going to get kicked out by large corporations that can actually justify the fees.
It already happened with microtx on-chain gambling sites and tipping getting kicked out for merchant adoption. And then merchant adoption got kicked out for large money movement like exchange settlements. This will get kicked out for even larger settlement. Everytime, they get kicked out to a higher level and higher level. Microtx is on LN because it's justified to spend the tx fees to open that channel. When it gets too much, bank-like services will appear that allows you to buy capacity on their LN channels and allow microtx to be based off their channels.
Math can prove this future easily. Given a limited block size, a fixed number of transactions per time unit can exist. As the number of transactions per time unit increase, the fees go up and they naturally need to batch to meet the on-chain fee requirements. When that batch value increases another order of magnitude, you'll no longer be able to meet the batch requirement yourself and you'll have to join a batch of batches.
Big blocks or small blocks all suffer from this. The difference is how many levels of batch of batches users are willing to tolerate. If you're on the 3rd level of batches and rely on a bank, does decentralization matter anymore?

Same rule applies if the fee is fixed in sat/byte and if it's floating. You'll pay more if you're inefficient until you go broke.

If they pay the fee, it's not spam. It helps secure the network and does so with less variance than BTC's fee market. The more use cases, the more interest in running a node is.
You think all these spammers won't be running a node? You can be sure they will be running at least 1 node because their business model depends on it. If they think the chain is too hard to maintain, then maybe their business model isn't suitable and they will not join the network. The problem solves itself, but in a different manner.

EUR/USD usually has positive carry for short positions, but not here. SP500 is at 0.01% per 8 hour, which looks small, but it comes out at 10.95% per year.
That most likely means they are not routing your positions to a market and are hoping other traders take the opposite positions. They even have a socialized losses system...
