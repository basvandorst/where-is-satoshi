there is no easy bitcoin to local currency exchanges. yes thats growing, but is it growing fast enough, will gov. make it easy to open one in every country/city. Maybe people who own coins can be currency exchanges themselves, and sell them and get some incentive back + fiat.

Millions have been pumped in bitcoin startups so far. Thats gambling too isn't it? like Time drapers 11m turning to 6m (i read in some post). Why play it safe when we know this is the future. 
@_date: 2017-02-23 10:34:09
No one discussing the 1MB permanent limit?
@_date: 2016-03-05 12:18:17
You are a genuine 
@_date: 2015-01-18 13:07:52
you are right
@_date: 2015-01-17 13:16:54
Millions of people get deterred from bitcoin because of that. I'm sure if you ask most of them, have you heard of bitcoin, they will say yes, but then they will say to you, so what?
@_date: 2015-01-18 13:07:35
I'm doing everything I can by talking about bitcoin to people who may not have otherwise heard / will hear of it otherwise. Trust me, if it was easy to open a booth and buy / sell btc, i'll be all in  
@_date: 2015-01-18 13:03:15
you are right
@_date: 2015-01-18 13:11:14
100% agree with you
@_date: 2015-01-17 13:36:00
i agree with you
@_date: 2016-03-15 11:41:00
Do you really think bitcoin is not centralized now? Did you hear how miners were influenced by a company? If thats not centralization, what is!?
@_date: 2015-01-18 13:04:07
I'm up for it, there should be an app to easily sell/buy bitcoin from point A and B
@_date: 2015-01-17 13:44:49
you are right!

there will be a next door neighbors kid who is!
@_date: 2015-01-17 13:18:55
that's like western union saying, why do we need to open booths, you can just go to the bank and exchange your money.
@_date: 2015-01-18 13:10:32
maybe booths can be setup only in capital cities. coordinate a day where they all open at once 
@_date: 2015-01-17 13:43:01
he is probably right. the rules and regulations in the gulf countries for example will be a pain to deal with. can bitcoin change that? do we even need exchanges?!
@_date: 2015-01-18 13:02:06
i like it!
@_date: 2017-03-04 11:54:13
How and why do you classify 'maybe' legitimate transactions as spam?
@_date: 2015-01-18 13:08:32
feels that way, but maybe we are expecting too much too fast
@_date: 2017-03-04 12:20:14
Come on, if the blame comes down to 1 person. Then maybe btc deserves to fail!
@_date: 2017-03-04 11:57:44
Simply this: what is your definition of spam? 
@_date: 2016-03-05 12:15:21
Getting miners in China to sign what software to run. What do you call that?
@_date: 2016-03-15 17:23:56
@_date: 2017-03-18 10:50:14
WTF - do you even know how btc works! 
Please reconsider. Core is not equal to btc.
@_date: 2017-03-05 13:48:44
If the test was to be conducted in an african country with no government, then what? Isn't the whole purpose of bitcoin is, it's open to all, regardless to what gov(s) do or say? If the network can't handle it then the network is broken. And again, if the capacity restriction is the problem, then maybe that capacity should not be there.
@_date: 2017-03-07 21:11:26
YES YES YES
@_date: 2017-03-18 13:21:29
Stop the lie. This is really pathetic. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 14:35:45
1. Segwit was not built for any limit increase, it just 'happened' to be a benefit of segwit. 
2. It's not 4mb and not 2mb but 1.7mb!
3. What happens when that limit is reached? And please don't say we will have LN by then. The idea of LN and some basic questions aren't even answered!!
@_date: 2017-03-05 11:40:55
Guys the attacks on Ver in this sub makes you look pathetic. And you call this sub better!??
@_date: 2017-03-09 22:39:49
I would love to see fair &amp; even criticism with any alternative implementation of btc. The fact that attacks on BU is allowed in this sub and everything else is not really puts this sub and anyone supporting this to shame.

Elon Musk plans to launch 4,000 satellites to deliver high-speed Internet access anywhere on Earth “all for the purpose of generating revenue to pay for a city on Mars.”
Can it be internet access and payment system
@_date: 2017-03-18 14:37:33
No disrespect, but you do sound like the XT supports back in the day. They did have support however small but no miners
@_date: 2017-03-04 20:16:40
One can argue, if someone wants to pay to spam the network. Then good. Don't you think? And can't  miners choose to reject txs less than specific fee?
@_date: 2017-03-18 13:13:32
What are you taking about!?
This is not segwit vs bu. Its small blocks forever vs let the market decide what a modest increase is. Stop spreading FUD
@_date: 2017-03-04 19:53:05
Good. So is it possible to mistake real transactions as spam? If so is it preventable?
@_date: 2017-03-18 14:12:07
Yes "small blocks forever" - point me at one post where a core dev hinted at any future HF to remove this stupid block size limit.
@_date: 2017-03-05 11:37:09
This is really cool, good luck :)
@_date: 2017-03-02 14:26:42

you can also call holding the 1MB restriction at all cost outrageous
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:01:50
It's really sad to see things go this way. It's even more disheartening knowing that there are people here who don't know the truth. If you like core and hate bu and wouldn't want to see 2 chains, consider bitcoinEC 
@_date: 2017-03-18 13:11:01
1. I thought node counts don't matter
2. BU hash is getting up there, whether you choose to see it or not
3. The fact that exchanges treat core = bitcoin is honestly stupid. The longest chain is what matters period.
If you hate BU so much, then follow BitcoinEC  - we all play for the same team here

What about the accelerator program that's offered by Viabtc - 1) why do more people use it? 2)  explain this from them "It's been taking less than 3 minutes for our tx accelerator to reach the hourly 100 limit in the last few days."?
@_date: 2017-03-18 13:18:31
Sorry to break it to you. In this situation node counts do not matter.
@_date: 2017-03-18 13:20:52
Basically what you are saying is Core = Bitcoin. Cringe!
@_date: 2016-11-13 11:18:27
@_date: 2016-11-08 16:19:49
Peter, with all due respect, what you said there is just delusional
@_date: 2016-11-20 10:46:37
1. 1.7MB not 2MB
2. 2MB block size with "sigwit" is not the same as increasing the block limit to 2MB - you know that.
@_date: 2016-11-20 10:25:11
Yes because everyone will want to use it then. The screams of people asking for &lt; 1MB is deafening!

@_date: 2016-11-16 11:08:33
Exactly, there is absolutely nothing wrong with educating the community - if anything it should be encouraged. Some people regard Ethereum split to be a success and to others its not. But everyone agrees that the events that led to Ethereum hard fork can not be compared to that of btc. Other implementations of btc should also be discussed to educate the community - again if anything it should be encouraged.
@_date: 2016-11-18 09:46:12
What the
@_date: 2016-11-29 20:10:36
We have to agree to disagree here. I think without open discussions, the line between what is false and what is the only solution to big problems becomes vague - this does nothing but creates a divide. I would like to think that both Core &amp; BU want the same thing, they want btc to succeed period.
@_date: 2016-11-30 11:16:01


There is nothing wrong with alcoin investors. Now ofcourse if they want their altcoins to increase in value by devaluing btc, I'm with you 100%. But I think there are many players here that feel as if you can't be investing in anything but btc, and if you do, you are a bad person. For instance, the number of times would attack and force him to say whether or not he's invested in altcoins (this is a while back I remember) is really childish. 
@_date: 2016-11-16 09:24:27
I get what you are saying. But don't you think it's odd that ethers hard fork which was controversial to begin with was talked about heavily here "ether good news is not allowed" but "ether bad news is allowed"
@_date: 2016-11-27 14:31:36
Segwit is a scalling solution now? what happens when we hit 4MB wall with segwit??
@_date: 2016-11-20 10:42:28
It's really funny reading BU FUD here. Who would have thought this is the same place that was not allowing alt-coin discussions. Come on luke. I guess the rules apply now "BU good = not allowed" "BU bad = allow". Everyone is in agreement that sigwit is awesome. You may think that 1MB is large, you should at least notice that many people want that temp limit to not even be there or at least push it to 2MB. Do you think Core will ever agree or consider increasing the limit, and if so, what's your theory?
@_date: 2016-11-17 11:49:34
I was around before dogecoin was a thing. I do read both forums with an open mind that there are people with interesting ideas and proposals. Whats shilling is this prospect of "if you don't follow ours rules (which I understand - however vague those rules are)" or "if you propose or suggest anything outside the confinement of what bitcoin is now aka 21m, 1m block etc" its not allowed here. Aren't all btc proposals / ideas suppose to upgrade and improve the protocol? Whether its sigwit or other proposals. Everyone wants its to grow. So why not allow those discussions - rather than picking and choosing whats allowed and whats not. When sharing ideas or suggesting changes (no matter how big or small they are), everybody should filter it by asking one question really, - will this help improve / grow usability of btc? if yes then allow it. Prephaps this way we can phase out the blocksize with time and have sigwit and have multiple implementations of btc all working together to improve the system. 
@_date: 2016-11-29 13:17:31
Do you really think that BU supporters are bitcoin haters now?? Wow

Everyone is guilt of playing a role in this drama, not just Ver. You know that.

Come on, we all know whose names we keep mentioning almost every second post. I think I speak on behalf of many people here when I say, it will make a difference when those actors decide to mend fences and have real technical talk and shake hands.
