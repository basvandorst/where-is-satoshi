That's a silly thing to say - if private companies saw that the government was willing to fund the research, why would the private companies have expended the resources to self-perform that research, when they could lower their own costs by simply not paying for the research then using its results? 


No, it's recognizing that companies minimize their expenses whenever possible, and would rather that the government fund the research than fund it internally. Now, if the government wasn't around to fund the research, or wasn't interested in funding the research, *then* private companies will happily internalize those costs. But in the existence of government funded research, there's no reason to. 
Look at how Space X has occurred - when the government was funding the rocket research, private companies were happy to let the government pay for it. But when the government stopped funding basic research into rockets, private companies took over. Which is exactly what I'm telling you is a general case for research.


Nice dick you're trying to swing there. How do you know I haven't "studied economics" too? I like how you can't actually argue against what I'm saying so you just insult me and claim to be smarter.




Recognizing that rational companies minimize their own research costs and are happy to let the government cover those expenses when the government is willing to do so isn't a "huge hole in my argument", it's recognizing how government funding of basic research distorts markets. 


That the government claims a monopoly on most basic research and funds a portion of it doesn't preclude arguments that the government is inept.

The refusal to participate in violence would necessarily stop any violence - if the Germans had refused to participate or support violence, there'd be no Holocaust to speak of. 
Please note how your thinking restricts you to outside forces refusing to participate, and you don't even manage to consider what would happen if the primary actors themselves refused.
Furthermore I might note that the Holocaust couldn't have happened without funding from Prescott Bush, the grandfather of George W. Bush, nor could it have happened without rubber and fuel processes provided by DuPont, information systems provided by IBM, and food preservation techniques provided by Birdseye.

Do you have difficulty with linear scales? The problem with linear scales is any large change in interest washes out your ability to see smaller interest levels from earlier on. Sure maybe it should be logarithmic so that it shows both small early interest and large late interest, but the "4 months of 0 at the start" is more a function of how popular it got in the last month, than any lack of interest in those 4 months.

I guess Federal Reserve Notes are illegal then huh? Sounds good! Gimme them Treasury Notes! 
@_date: 2014-05-04 05:07:12


Did I not explain this to you? The Treasury issues Treasury Bonds, which are exchanged to the Federal Reserve for Federal Reserve Notes. The Treasury Bonds carry interest, and must be repaid, ergo, they are *debt*. Each physical dollar in existence originates from a T-Bill / Federal Reserve Note swap, so each physical dollar in existence is *debt*. 


Private banks own shares in the Federal Reserve. It's as simple as that.


No. The Treasury is issuing T-Bills that are purchased with Federal Reserve Notes issued by the Federal Reserve. The BEP only prints dollars to fulfill the FRN / T-Bill swap. I really don't see how you're having trouble with this. If the Treasury were directly issuing "dollars", they would be Treasury Notes, not Federal Reserve Notes.

Of course if your position were accurate, the financial collapse of 07/08 would never have happened, so reality itself proves you to be wrong. 


Economy of scale has to do with cost, it doesn't have to do with health, and larger banks are at a much greater risk of insolvency because their leverage ratios are higher and their great size means they are more sensitive to a changing environment (just like dinosaurs! Imagine that!).

You said "Everyone who hasn't fought the system has recognized it's legitimacy" which implies that any slaves who "hadn't fought the system" had "recognized its legitimacy". 


Because computers were developed by private industry. 


This whole "that the government did it, therefore only the government could have done it" stuff needs to be recognized as a formal fallacy by this point. It's so goddamn common. Imagine how crazy people would think you were if you suggested "that Henry Ford invented the assembly line, therefore *only* Henry Ford could have invented the assembly line". 


Your argument doesn't demonstrate that the government has reduced the cost of anything - only that its outcomes are *sometimes* public. There's a lot of publicly funded research that *isn't* publicly available, which means the public was forced to pay for it yet doesn't have access to it or benefit it. Any claims that the government has reduced the price of something are offset by instances where the government has actually increased the price of it or made people who haven't benefited from a thing pay for it. 
You see, the government can't break the laws of economics. The government can only shift prices around and force a bunch of people to pay for something so that the cost for *some people* is lower by making the price for *other people* higher.
On top of that there are planning inefficiencies, administrative deadweight, and other systemic losses that necessarily mean that government redistribution of resources costs more than market activities.

That's because you project that belief system onto them, not because they actually have that belief system. The government is who neglects, and doesn't give a fuck, about the poor. Libertarians are all about helping the poor by removing the shackles the government put on them.
The fact that 75% of the poor person's income goes to the government means nothing though, right? Because libertarians who believe in voluntary interaction, and want 100% of that income to stay with the poor person, are the real enemy... according to your God and master, the government!

Dollars are promise to pay, but what are you going to pay with? *More promises!* Wow that makes sense...
@_date: 2014-05-04 01:49:20
You misunderstand the situation. 
That dollar bill exists because the US Treasury sold a Treasury Bond ("T-Bill") to the Federal Reserve, who purchased the Treasury Bond with Federal Reserve Notes, aka "dollar bills". The Treasury is then *indebted* to the Federal Reserve and pays interest on that debt. 
So, yes, that dollar in your hand means that the US Treasury owes repayment of the T-Bill to the Federal Reserve, *at interest*. 
Now you know that each dollar that exists represents interest bearing debt from the Treasury to the Federal Reserve. 
Did you know that the Federal Reserve is owned by private banks? Or that the interest payments on T-bills (Treasury Bonds) is roughly equivalent to the amount the IRS collects in income taxes?
None of this is authorized by the Constitution! 
The Constitution says only ***CONGRESS*** has the ability to mint coins and print bills! If ***CONGRESS*** printed bills via the Treasury, instead of selling T-Bills to the Federal Reserve in exchange for debt-created Federal Reserve Notes, money would exist without debt, no interest would have to be paid, and *you wouldn't have to pay income taxes*. 
By the way, *100% of your income for the first four months of the year* are you working off your income taxes, which go to *privately owned banks*.
Now do you understand how fiat money is debt? 
@_date: 2014-07-07 16:30:45
So you're admitting is you don't have any argument. 
@_date: 2014-06-26 19:12:49


That the government asserts a monopoly on some things does not require that the government is the only entity able to provide those things.


And if these are things we need, then clearly there's no necessity to use coercion to fund them, because people gladly purchase *other things they need* such as food, clothing, housing, etc without coercion.


You fail to understand the difference between disputing the thing, and disputing the way the thing is funded.

@_date: 2014-06-26 17:48:14


Not at all! I'm saying that the [economic calculation problem]( tells us that the budgeting is *so complex* that it *can't* be effectively planned by a centralized government, and the only way to manage that complexity is to break it into pieces and manage each piece separately.
This is how complex electronic systems are designed - by breaking it down into constituent parts and handling each part separately. You couldn't do a wholistic design for a smartphone, but by designing each part separately, the smartphone becomes feasible. 


That I find the government to be illegitimate is the opposite of an "obligation" to participate in it. That's like suggesting that an abolitionist has an "obligation" to purchase slaves and be a "good" slave-owner, as opposed to trying to *abolish slavery*.

2. Merchants ***CANNOT*** discount the prices when not using cards or they will lose their ability to process cards.
3. Merchants ***CANNOT*** charge you directly the fees they are required to hide from you.


This is because of the credit cards, not because of BTC.

**[tails-news] Who are you helping when donating to Tails?**
Tails is being distributed free of charge because we strongly believe that [free software is more secure by design] ( But also because we think that **nobody should have to pay to be safe while using computers**. Unfortunately, Tails cannot stay alive without money as developing Tails and maintaining our infrastructure [has a cost](
We rely solely on donations from individuals and supporting organizations to keep Tails updated and getting always better. **That's why we need your help!**
If you find Tails useful, please consider [donating money]( or [contributing some of your time and skills]( to the project. Donations to Tails are tax-deducible both in the US and in Europe.
In October 2014, Tails was being used by more than 11 500 people [daily]( The profile of Tor and Tails users is very diverse. This diversity increases the anonymity provided by those tools for everyone by making it harder to target and to identify a specific type of user. From the various contacts that we have with organizations working on the ground, we know that Tails has been used by:
**Journalists wanting to protect themselves or their sources.**
* [Reporters Without Borders]( is an organization that promotes and defends freedom of information, freedom of the press, and has consultant status at the United Nations. RWB [advertises the use of Tails]( for journalists to fight censorship and protect their sources. RWB uses Tails in their training sessions world-wide.
* [According to Laura Poitras, Glen Greenwald, and Barton Gellman]( Tails has been an essential tool to work on the Snowden documents and report on the NSA spying. In a recent [article for The Intercept]( Micah Lee gives many details on how Tails helped them starting to work together.
* [Fahad Desmukh]( a freelance journalist based in Pakistan who is also working for [Bytes for All]( always has a Tails USB handy: "I can use it whenever I may need to and I especially make sure to keep it with me when travelling. Pakistan really isn't the safest place for journalists so thanks to the Tails team for an amazing tool."
* [Jean-Marc Manach]( a journalist based in France and specialized in online privacy said that "war reporters have to buy helmets, bullet-proof vests and rent armored cars; journalists using the Internet for their investigations are much luckier: to be as secured as war reporters, they only have to download Tails, burn it on a CD, install it on a SD card, and learn the basics of information and communication security, and it's free!"
**Human-right defenders organizing in repressive contexts.**
* Tails has been used in combination with [Martus]( an information system used to report on human rights abuses, to allow [Tibetan communities in exile]( to protect themselves from targeted malware attacks.
  
**Democracy defenders facing dictatorships.**
* The [National Democratic Institute]( a Washington-based democracy support organization that works in more than 70 countries around the world, has used Tails to [help human rights defenders to communicate securely]( For instance, NDI used Tails to created a [data collection system in Belarus]( to help opposition forces to collect, store and manage voter information.
**Citizens facing national emergencies.**
During the last years, we noticed that the use of Tor and Tails systematically peaks when countries face national emergencies. Even if Tails represents a small amount of the global Tor usage, it is advertised by the Tor Project as the safest platform to protect from strong adversaries.
* In [Starting a revolution with technology]( Slim Amamou, Tunisian blogger and former Secretary of State for Sport and Youth, explains that Tor "was vital to get information and share it" during the Tunisian revolution of 2011, because social media pages sharing information about the protests were "systematically censored so you could not access them without censorship circumvention tools".
* Between January 25, the day the Egyptian Revolution of 2011 began, and January 27 2011, the number of [Tor users in Egypt]( was multiplied at least by 4. On January 27, the Egyptian goverment decided to halt Internet access accross the country.
* Between March 19 and March 31, the number of [Tor users in Turkey]( was multiplied by 3 as a direct response to the growing Internet censorship in the country: on 20 March 2014, access to Twitter was blocked in Turkey, and on 27 March 2014 access to YouTube was blocked.
**Domestic violence survivors escaping from their abusers.**
* The Tor Project has been working with organizations fighting against domestic violence such as [NNEDV]( [Transition House]( and [Emerge]( to help survivors escape digital surveillance from their abuser and report on their situation. As [domestic abuse goes digital]( circumvention tools like Tor and Tails end up as one of the only options.

*That is not how you value something!* You cannot value a thing by destroying a completely unrelated thing. You can't set the value of your house by destroying your car. *Valuation does not work like that*. 


If someone agrees with your valuation, *they simply buy the thing you are trying to establish a value for, for a price you both agree on*. *That* is how valuation works. 


LTV is *literally what these idiots are arguing for!* They are arguing that the thing has a "value" set by the "labor" (BTC) expended to create it. *That is what LTV is!* How can you not see that?

[Why does it matter if an asset is tangible?]( Goodwill is intangible, and yet is accounted for. Brand is intangible, yet accounted for. IP is intangible, yet is accounted for. You act as if intangibility is some new concept for businesses, it's not. It's well understood. Nobody destroys their brand in order to prove the value of their brand, when you recontextualize the concept it becomes apparent that the action you are encouraging is in fact foolish.

A liquidity problem is still a solvency problem. If you don't have the liquidity to cover your liabilities, you're insolvent, no matter what the future potential for selling illiquid assets might be. Assets are not cash money, but they can often be converted into cash with time. If I try to claim I'm simply illiquid, not insolvent, because I lacked the cash on hand to pay my debts, "but I get paid next week", I'd be laughed out of the room.

Thank you but I don't need definitions. I find that a bit... paternalistic, that you would act as if I need an education simply because I disagree with you on the specifics of how this works. 


When you have illiquid assets, you cannot convert them to cash quickly and with minimal impact on the price received, 
***ERGO*** 
You are insolvent. 
It's that goddamn simple. 


You can be insolvent without being illiquid, but if you are illiquid you are insolvent and trying to create liquidity is only going to worsen the problem.
Please re-read my arguments and get back to me when you've taken the time to understand what I'm telling you, which is the same thing your source is telling you, is that illiquid assets cannot be sold for their book value, thus you are insolvent while also being illiquid.

No, it doesn't; it just requires ending the support systems that falsely prop up the value of the assets that the rich man holds. 
For example, *if not for* the bailouts in '08, a very significant portion of wealth for a very significant portion of the financial elite would have evaporated overnight.
Why do you think the bailouts were so "crucial" to our "economy"? 
*If not for* the ongoing support of the government, these "valuable" businesses would evaporate overnight simply due to the systemic operating losses generated by such an unwieldy organization without some external support framework.
Easy way to think of it - these businesses are tents made of silk raised on the backs of the public, and when the tent-pole of government (the many, strong-armed or manipulated into supporting the few) is removed, the lofty ceilings collapse into the mud.

Because it scales according to your karma, which means that as you are successful the cost of submission increases to something that becomes relevant. This ensures that it's cheap to get started but the more you use it the better quality your content needs to be. 
Also, the aggregate cost of submitting lots of content that isn't upvoted will disincentivize spam. And the more one spams through a single account the more it will cost to spam. 


Since these transactions are going through a centralized clearinghouse (at this point) what makes you think they can't be bundled?

People DO pay you for your content. Read, comprehend, THEN post, please. It's far less work for me if you know what you're talking about before you talk. 


There is an intermediary in this version, yes, and as I explained, I'm trying to figure out how to get rid of the clearinghouse aspect, but right now the repost controls (again, read the damn submission) require time-separation from voting to payment in order to identify reposts. 
Also, what do you mean by "stealing the money"? I don't see what the incentive is for the clearinghouse to kill their golden goose to get one extra egg. The money is only in the clearinghouse for however long it takes to create a confidence level that the submission is not a repost.

I think that it's the philosophically the same as normal mining processes. 


When you successfully mine a block, you get bitcoin. Bam. There's your transitive creation.
If I go outside and start carving wood, and make a bunch of bullshit carvings nobody wants, that doesn't mean the carvings are worth-ful. However, if I do make one someone likes, and they buy it, there's your transaction. The same action can have two different outcomes, one of which establishes a value, one of which doesn't. 
This is not, to my understanding, representative of what is happening with burning coins.

You are in fact insolvent. It doesn't matter if *maybe*, you can *eventually* pay your debts. Your insolvency is *now*, future conditions are irrelevant. Realistically, for a company in this situation, the value of their "assets" is zero until those assets are sold. And if you're selling assets because you're unable to pay your debts? Guess what! You're getting shit prices for those assets. People don't pay premiums to desperate men. 


Only to find that the value of the asset you wrote in your book is not nearly what you expected it to be and you were in fact illiquid *and* insolvent. Which is why they didn't go that route, it would have exposed the whole game.

In the USA it takes 7 years for bad debt to leave your record, and the only class of debt that cannot be discharged in bankruptcy are student loans. If you default on student loans, you will NEVER receive a personal tax return ever again, no matter how much you owed on student loans or how much you should see in tax returns. You cannot be hired by a government agency or anyone who contracts with the government, you cannot join the military, you cannot receive social security, medicare, medicaid, basically you are *dead* to the FedGov if you default. Great fucking job you shit-brick fucktards Federal bastards debt-monger cocksuckers.

What you're saying is that the Fed interferes in the market to ensure that the parties who created the mal-investments stay afloat instead of losing their asses. 
If the responsible parties lose their asses when their bad bets come due, it takes longer to recover, but your economy is much healthier because people who make poor decisions have their influence reduced. 


What you're saying is that misrepresentations of risk created by setting interest rates by fiat cause malignant mal-investment for a longer period and thereby create a greater disruption when the mal-investment is finally brought to a head. That the market doesn't set rates naturally merely hides problems longer by systemic misrepresentation of risk.

Your link doesn't provide the evidence you'd like to think it does - in the same size periods before and after 1913, there are an equivalent number of cyclic events on either side. That there have been more years from 1913 until 2013, versus from 1854 to 1913 is relevant to the absolute number of cycles being counted. 
There have in fact been 5 more business cycles *after* the Fed's establishment than before, if we ignore the disparate size of the periods being analyzed, so you don't win any points on that argument either.
Never mind that this has nothing at all to say about the impact each cycle had on the economy. 
Never mind that there continue to be business cycles, of any size, of any frequency, *in and of itself* undoes the elimination of business cycles as justification for the Fed.

Key word *growing*, not mature. Tesla is a growing business, and EV are a growing market - neither Tesla, nor EVs, nor BTC are mature or widely used enough, nor had in enough volume, to warrant selling Teslas denominated in BTC.


You're the only one showing ignorance here. How many Teslas could Elon reasonably sell via BTC? If the answer isn't greater than the costs to Tesla for selling in BTC, and the risks to Tesla for accepting an experimental currency whose value continues to fluctuate considerably, then it's not time yet to petition Tesla to accept BTC.
As I said before, right now people should focus on smaller, more frequent, and more widespread purchases for BTC, such as buying a Coke. Larger, infrequent, less common purchases such as vehicles should be reserved for when BTC is valued highly enough, and used widely enough, for it to make sense for Tesla to take on the risks and expenses of using BTC. 
So, do you want to have a mature, reasoned debate about the gradual implementation of BTC as a competitive currency, or do you want to stamp your foot and piss your pants like a little kid angry that the arcade tokens aren't accepted as currency at the corner shop?

Not financed by the Feds, but "guaranteed" by the Feds. "Guaranteed" means, if you don't pay them back, the Feds will fuck you sideways with a crowbar. *And the public cheers for this!* Bank values are largely predicated on the guaranteed long term income they get from charging interest on *risk free loans* to students, and the massively bloated price of these loans thanks to the "guarantee". "Guaranteed" student loans are essentially a fat and dirty handjob from the Feds to the banks. 
To put this in perspective, prior to Fed "guarantees" for student loans, college / university (in the USA these are the same) education was 20% of the average salary. Now, college / university education is 125% of the average salary. **Thanks, Feds!** You fucking bastards.

Again, direct allocations stop people in poverty from finding resolution to their *systemic cause* of poverty. Explaining what they're spending the money on doesn't change that. 


This does not matter and is not relevant. Direct contributions stop people from resolving their poverty. 


Correct, and the only people who can get them out of it is THEM, because it's *their* thinking and acting that is creating this situation. Others can *help you* stay in poverty (typically, by direct allocations), but only you can *make you* stay in poverty.

I never claimed any of these, and it's gover***N***ment, by the way. But seriously, if the public decides they will no longer respect or support the existence of a government, what in the world could cause them to whiplash back to accepting a government? It's like arguing that the federal democratic republic of the United States would inevitably revert to a monarchy - which, it kind of has, so isn't that an argument for getting rid of government whole-cloth, so that it's harder for the reversion? 


How? 


If you'll stop claiming without proof that it's worse.


"Nuh uh I can't hear you nah nah nah!"


It's called the principle of induction. Every revolution has been an overthrow of government and the implementation of a more liberal government which eventually reverts back to a form of the prior government and is overthrown. The inductive result is that eventually the government will be overthrown, and the ultimate liberalization of government will occur, where no new government is instituted to replace the prior one. 


And you can't say it's worse, but history and induction give us strong suggestions that no government will be far better than any government.
