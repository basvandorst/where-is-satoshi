-- one among litterally thousands of examples from r/bitcoin as well as bitcointalk and others controlled by theymos and the other cohorts here.  There used to be neutral mods, but theymos removed them.  All you really need to do to see how bad it is, is run un-delete on r/bitcoin... then after you see how they selectively filter and delete comments, take a look at the selective CSS settings which were written to promote core friendly comments while shuffling other comments out of view.  Ever wondered why r/bitcoin is different from any other sub on reddit in how it handles upvotes / downvotes / comment hiding and promotion? 
Give it a shot, just try to read the 72kb CSS blob they inserted in order to filter comments... 
The evidence is massive, just google censorship r/bitcoin or censorship bitcointalk, or censorship (insert theymos controlled forum), and you will find countless and blatant examples.  I'm not sure why you question it since they don't even deny it themselves...  while /btc and other btc sites gladly provides their moderation logs, /bitcoin refuses to do so.  Fortunately, those of us who pay attention see what is happening, but unfortunately, most people come here first.  I know this since I spent a lot of time promoting r/bitcoin and bitcointalk as well as promoting bitcoin in general before the massive change occurred here when blockstream swept into power.

I think that you do need it for every transaction, just like everyone else does.

My point is that privacy by default should be the standard and it should be built into your normal methods of transacting for free.  It shouldn't be a choice except for your ability to not be private if you take extra steps.
@_date: 2016-08-14 20:24:54


Dancing around the fact?  People have always said stupid things on reddit and always will, and you clearly aren’t dancing around anything.  Your statements are angry and direct.  That said, I don’t have much of a problem with your delivery style, but I have a huge problem with what you are doing.




Your policies have gone WAY beyond mitigating abuse, and have stopped discussion of entire topics from ever happening.  This is not the same and for you to continue acting like it is suggests that you have some alternative motivation.  




Stop calling things hostile by default.  Nothing is hostile or contentious at birth.  These are successful or failed code updates, nothing more.  Your ability to label something contentious or hostile is the essence of the issue.  You are way past arrogant if you truly believe that the moderation team here is in any way capable of seeing a big enough picture to decide what is hostile, or contentious, or whatever label, and deciding what is good for bitcoin.  STOP DOING THIS. 


This is the main problem and the origin of the division.  You should remove that policy and things will slowly start to get better.  Bitcoin needs active discussion of forks to survive.  And the concept that these forks are contentious upon birth needs to be squashed from the earth.  Again, nothing should be contentious upon birth.  Everything should be thoroughly discussed in the open.
 


Playing favorites is bad, and certainly you guys moderate in some ways that keep this from happening.  Maybe you don't get enough praise for this, but you shouldn’t conflate these good things with the other things you are doing.  You calling other people hypocritical and actually being correct doesn’t preclude your from being hypocritical about other things, so this in no way white washes the existence of your bad decisions.

Bash, your comment is too full of vitriol.  You need to step back.  
1. I don't need you to refute the links.  I didn't even bother to look at them.  The reality is that I've been here the whole time.  I've seen the comments restructured, deleted, and the important topics removed in mass from even being discussed.  I've seen days when 80 to 90 of the material has been deleted from a specific thread, even entire threads deleted.  You can claim the cashing services are not accurate, but that only holds water so far.  I've seen it when it was happening, and it served nothing other than eliminating discussion. 
2.  Sorry, i can't understand the 72kb of CSS that is written in 1 line.  I would never normally do this, but since you are,.. where is your evidence that any significant majority of these comments and downvotes are not legitimate beyond the evidence against your own side doing the same?  To me the trolling has always been balanced enough by itself without a 72kb code blob.
3.  Censorship claims exagerated?  No, sorry, I've seen it with my own eyes.  Days when something important happened that didn't follow the pro blockstream narative, and comments as well as entire topics disappeared in mass.  Your side claims that they were just protecting the crowd from brigading, and I guarantee that 'sometimes' you are right, but this didn't stop there.  What this sub and bitcoin talk did was not just to stop the brigading, it went so far as to eliminate entire ranges of conversation from even happening.  Do you seriously not remember the whole "alt-coin" labeling phase that was used as an excuse to not even allow discussion of forks?  Elimination of discussion is not the same as friendly prevention of brigading that was used as the excuse.
4. MOD logs, what are you talking about?  You don't need to present the mod logs to detractors.  Just fucking release them.  It is that simple.  There is no good reason mod logs aren't released.  Then this bullshit "where is your evidence of censorship" crap would simply disappear.  Censorship or lack thereof would either be there or it wouldn't.   
5.  I don't care about r btc.  They released their mod logs and that is good on them.  Beyond that, they are full of people who are bitter from the experience here.  What would you expect?  
6.  No one expects you to be unmoderated.  But your "moderation" policies aren't moderation any more when they eliminate topics that are incredibly important to our industry from even being discussed.  At that point the supposed moderation policies start guiding industry consensus.  The U.S. govt uses this same technique to great effect. 
7.  Lastly, the insinuation that Blockstream has influence on moderation was nothing more than insinuation.  It comes from my long time exposure to the flow of comments and moderation on this site.  It comes because the existence of blockstream came about just before the inane changes to the 'moderation' system here and BT, as well as the changes to the dynamic in the entire bitcoin system.  The fact that the time-frames correspond could be a coincidence, but really, for me to accept that, I would have to ignore that they have had an impact on the entire industry.  Then I would have ignore that that has a direct impact on discussion throughout the industry.  Then I would have to ignore that this is a discussion site which would logically mean that discussion here was impacted.  Then I would have to ignore that the massive changes in ‘moderation’ policy occurred at the same time.  But of course for me to ignore all of those things would be just as stupid stupid stupid as labeling those who have opposing viewpoints ignorant while using a soapbox and control of the moderation policies to eliminate real discussion.  … just an insinuation.

You are nuts if you really believe that bitcoin is private. The only reason people get away with using dark net markets is because they jump through hoops to do so.  These are the exceptions to the rule.  And if they don't jump through these hoops, they might as well be handing their names over to the police.  Even if they do, the technologies that exist for analyzing the block chain are getting better and better every day.  And even more important to understand is that what you do on the block chain is permanent.  Even if you don't make a mistake that can be detected today, it might be able to be detected in the future. 
I want to be very clear, if you are capable of being truly private, then you are not an average person.  And certainly, the average torrent user is by no means capable of the steps necessary to maintain their privacy on a permanent and public record like the BTC blockchain.  It is disingenuous of you to suggest this.
@_date: 2016-08-11 20:34:19
I used to pay 1 satoshi or even 0, quite often and miners would pick the transactions up no problem.
@_date: 2016-08-05 18:46:57
Any centralized system will share the same privacy concerns unless you 100% trust the payment channel manager, and 100% trust that they can't be compromised.  I like the idea, but it should be tied to a blockchain that by default is systemically private.   Maybe when zkSNARK happen and have been proven reliable then this is plausible.

@_date: 2016-08-05 18:30:23
Microtransactions aren't feasible in bitcoin without centralized interactions due to high fees, so this means that a 3rd party is required in order to handle settlements, cash outs, and micro-transactions within their own infrastructure.  A system attached to torrent transfers would need to be done this way.
This is a privacy risk since your bitcoins would then be tied to your torrenting habits and anyone with half a mind knows that bitcoin is essentially a free information gathering platform for the feds unless you are not just an average user. 
Uploading bitcoin to a centralized third party is a risk regardless, but in these cases, it would be especially dangerous.  If one of these services are compromised, the feds can track everyone who was using the platform.  The feds would have admissible proof in the block chain to tie "questionable" behavior to individuals on a large scale.

If your anger is justified then what of the volume of people who have put massive amounts of work into BIP’s that have been poo poo’ed or outright ignored since the people in this sub and in several of the other major discussion forums decided they were not worthy of discussion and then blasted them out of existence by labeling them contentious and then disappearing them. 




As far as I know, the study didn’t show much other than timing of voting and connection to individual profiles.  This shows that there COULD be manipulation or bots, but your conclusion was that it DID show there were bots.  There is a big difference.  Your study had no mechanism to distinguish between what were bots vs real people aside from timing, but you don’t account for anything else that could be a factor.  For example, a significant amount of the population here (when we were unified) hated theymos because of what he was doing, so they would downvote him.  His comments often would become the center of discussion because they were impacting people dramatically and directly.  So it is natural that his comments were down voted quickly.  Your study did nothing to account for the fact that he was often the center of attention, and largely hated.  Obviously all the users your study targeted aren’t as public as theymos, but a good chunk of them are.  So while some of the data likely shows voter manipulation, its impossible to say definitely that it does show voter manipulation, and even though you can say that there is a high probability it shows voter manipulation in some cases, you can’t say how much of an impact it had relative to real votes.  That is what you wanted the study to say, but you have to face the fact that it didn’t.  And since it doesn’t definitely say what is real vs manipulation, my perception is that for some of those people who were receiving mass downvotes, they were simply getting a lot of downvotes.  This of course would be a factor that would oppose your dialog surrounding the issue, but you can’t ignore that XT and btc gained significant traffic due to your policies.  Yet you ignore the potential impact that these real people could have on your study. 


“Given the underhanded, deceptive and manipulative tactics employed to” shut down discussion across the major bitcoin discussion points, it is impossible to have a healthy bitcoin network, since you are essentially shutting down free market forces which have been demanding on-chain AND off-chain scaling, as well as privacy features.  


Discussion of forks have never been promoted here since the mod shift occured, and it is a slap in the face that you would say that after banning countless people to the degree that a chilling effect could be felt in every thread.  I know I kept my mouth shut plenty of times in the past for fear of being kicked off, and while you may take that as a joke or say what the fuck is wrong with you, you should own up to the fact that what you are doing is promoting this type of behavior and has been for far too long now.  Sticking out a heavily moderated and shill like sticky discussion as evidence of your fair and balanced approach is a serious slap in the face.

There is massive evidence that they are controlling key dialog centers throughout the industry.  Since they control the dialog, they control the direction of the entire development focus.  Ask yourself this... if their ideas are good enough to stand on their own, then why do they need a massive and organized effort to control industry wide dialog? 
Also, why are there currently zero on-chain solutions being developed by core from among the MANY proposed?  Can anyone really seriously act like none of the solution proposals from the diverse group of people who offered them are worth anything, while everything that core proposes is?  
You have to realize that what is happening is not natural.  They are controlling the dialog, and they are shutting down alternatives by simply not developing any alternative ideas.  In a good open source system, this does not happen, but it is here.

Original vs non original has no meaning.  We are literally talking about a 100% reproducible bunch of 1's and 0's.  At any point, the only difference between the 'original' vs an 'alt' which is derived from it is that at some point, the people with the most PoW decided that the chain should be appended to in a different way than another group who starts from the same end point on the chain and then starts adding blocks in a different way.
A better way of thinking of things is that every single block is a fork from the previous version of the blockchain, and that orphans are examples of failed forks.
Throughout all of this, the only thing that matters is security, and that is provided only by who has the most computational power securing their additions to the chain.  The group with the lower amount of computational power will always be venerable to attacks as long as they maintain the same PoW algorithm.

Yes, the lack of competition is making purse grow bold in its treatment of its smaller bitcoin sellers.

They should offer lower fees for 0 to 3 purchases a month and then ramp up from there in order to charge the businesses a little more.

This sounds like nonsense.  Bitcoin is a new type of thing.  It is both a commodity and an currency, and the government should classify it as both.  Transactions in bitcoin need a whole new status for taxes.  Perhaps a good way to deal with it would be to tax conversions of derivatives just as they are now in other markets, while not taxing transfers or purchases with actual bitcoin at all.  After all, it is just a currency on that level.

I am ok with people calling banks useful, assuming they are not fucking stupid people with usary (which is basically all they do).  Obviously neither bitcoin nor lightening or anything else will save people from their own idiocy.  But this is a different subject than the problem bitcoin was supposed to solve.  Remember that bitcoin really exists to fix two major problems...
1.  Inflationary currency issuance
2.  Censorable digital transactions
Any core solution should only be pursued if they fix one of these two problems.  Lightening does neither.  It is a layer 2 solution and has nothing to do with bitcoin.  I have no idea why core and r bitcoin is placing any emphasis on it as though it it is going to fix any of the underlying problems in bitcoin.  It enables banks, governments, censorship, and other centralized entities while doing nothing related to fixing the two key points.  It seems like its best quality is that it is a successful distraction from people realizing that access to the main chain is slowing becoming strictly relegated to rich people (the governments, banks, etc...).

Number 2 is broken in bitcoin's current form.  Peer to peer transactions are not supposed to be relegated to the rich.  High fees are a form of access control.  High fees were never supposed to happen.  Fees were supposed to stay relatively constant (and near zero) while number of transactions grows.  
The "fee market" was designed to kick in about 100 years from now and it should **NOT** be focused on fee per transaction.  It is designed to maximize fees by increasing total number of transactions all at low fees.  Every single transaction should be cheap enough that the poorest people in the world can still access the main chain with a fee that is small enough that they can afford. 
Lightening adds a second layer which I am perfectly fine with, but it does not solve this issue.  The things that solve number 2 are either larger block size or higher efficiency per block.  I am for both, but core is not prioritizing either. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:11:57
I think that is nonsense.  Bitcoin has been a drama queen every single day since some guy paid 10000 for some pizza.  Every single day.  
Nothing has every slowed its adoption except for the division that was forcibly created within the community by certain people.  
In my mind, competition is and always was good.  Nothing has ever made me worry.  Either bitcoin gets itself back to the level of utility it provided when I first used it, or it goes away, replaced by something that does provide utility.  As for me, I'm not selling either and I wish success upon both but the way btc is going it isn't looking good.

There are no alternative versions that have remotely close to the traction of core.  This would force people to give real consideration not only about what version they would use, but also about the underlying structure of how code is accessed. It would also likely result in the decentralization of the code base as any logical coders would obviously prefer not to be in a position where any single person could create a stoppage point in their workflow. 
Obviously this shouldn't need to happen for decentralization of the code base and access methods to occur, but it was presented as a somewhat nuclear option in light of the heavy handed information control tactics that are being institutionalized via all the main bitcoin discussion channels.

Your "limited good" is artificially limited.  The limitation has no relationship to technological costs, physical costs, or any other market driven cost.  For 70 years Moore's law has governed technological development.  Yet for some reason a group of assholes have decided that their understanding of technology should govern development instead of the market.  
Satoshi spoke heavily of this.  He described exactly what should happen with node sizes, block sizes, and scaling in general.  Yet he is ignored both in the white paper and in his further writings. 
A number of proposals were created which tied on chain scaling to Moore's law, and all of them were denied by core in favor of their personally chosen 2nd layer solutions.  They blew off market driven solutions because of their hubris and ego.  This is a travesty and is not motivated by libertarian or any market driven mentalities.

He said his idea was to level the playing field...
If they actually shut down the GIT, it would do exactly that because everyone would still have access to the software, but a real vote would be had as people rebuilt new access points to the software development process.
This would also have the consequence of decentralizing the core ownership over the main software.  This could be good or bad depending on whether you like the current core direction or whether you would rather have a more decentralized approach to the development process.

That is wishful thinking.  These guys are the banks of the future, but they will be far more effective because they can use algorithms to detect patterns they consider "unusual" and then sell that data to the government.  
This is exactly why we need to stop debating the size limit, and started talking about how we can integrate real privacy features into the core protocol.  People seem to remember that this is a problem from time to time and make a stink about it, but then stupid crap like block limits create a diversion and people forget about privacy again.

The author was wrong about everything else, but privacy is a major problem that bitcoin needs to address before I consider it to be a real game changer. 
@_date: 2015-06-18 03:53:27
Bitcoin is valuable primarily because of security, utility, and scarcity.  It would be far more valuable if it was private, but there are people who are working on that on other coins, and hopefully, eventually the bitcoin core developers will get past the people trying to limit block size, and start working on the real problem of near 0 privacy.

Uncensorable?  So we get to your supposed vision of an uncensorable digital asset by censoring all the media surrounding that asset?  
I disagree with you.  Bitcoin can be both a general asset register and the go-to digital asset in the world.  And it doesn't mean IOU's ever need to enter the picture.  The code is just as strong as it is now, or even stronger, with larger blocks and a larger user-base.

If it becomes to big to actually be meaningful to the average person, a new system will take its place.

That will include anonymity for every single purchase, which bitcoin needs to address. 
There may also be markets for big clearing house style operations on the bitcoin chain, and more commonly used chains for the average person.

Peter R has published actual data and put his research out in the open for peer review.  How is that in any way propaganda?

It isn't always just faith.  You can use algorithms to scan the number of nodes who have propagated your transactions and make logical decisions based on that info.  Some of the things that have been happening will reduce the ability to apply logic based on knowledge of transaction propagation.

The real issue with your concept is that "showing them how it works" is impossible because 99.999% of "how it works" is currently in the process of being invented.  Their restrictions, while potentially well intentioned (or not?) limit some portion of that 99.999% yet to be invented portion, which is not something good for developers.  It might seem like it is good for individuals using these services because it provides them some concept of protections now, but it won't be good for consumers in the end since it may limit the development of ideas.  Those ideas require completely new ways of thinking and can be inhibited by placing restrictions on the space at this early of a time.   
It would have been better to wait 20 to 30 years before placing any form of restrictions on this field... since by nature, the blockchain and bitcoin are self governing, why should outside government come into play this early?

@_date: 2015-06-01 05:34:30
That is wishful thinking.  These guys are the banks of the future, but they will be far more effective because they can use algorithms to detect patterns they consider "unusual" and then sell that data to the government.  
This is exactly why we need to stop debating the size limit, and started talking about how we can integrate real privacy features into the core protocol.  People seem to remember that this is a problem from time to time and make a stink about it, but then stupid crap like block limits create a diversion and people forget about privacy again.
Increase the block limits, and then lets work on privacy. I don't want to live in a micromanaged top down economy where the government uses information to blackmail people that would remove them from power.

I think you hit the nail on the head here.  Crypto and blockchain based tech is here to stay.  It is just a matter of time before it becomes ubiquitous.  As the field grows, we will see tons of awesome innovation.  It will only be the strong and adaptable that survive, just like in evolution.  
Creating a balance between adaptability and the security that comes from conservatism in the protocol is a difficult issue, but the reality is that change absolutely has to be possible, and not just once, but any time that something better has established itself through the test of time in the alt worlds.  It not only needs to be able to be incorporated, but relatively quickly.  
We are languishing in a quibble over a minor thing.  What happens when we get to the really dirty overhaul the protocol needs relating to privacy or something similarly important?

You may be right, but more likely he had never seen an answer to his question and thought it would be good to post here.  As to the "not doing anything" idea, this seems to agree with him... 
Also, as I have said, I have never seen once any real research behind the premise that larger blocks bring centralization.  I have seen real research in the opposite vein however.  This makes roadmaps like what the core team have established somewhat questionable when there is a solution that has been tested extensively waiting for us.

What we do know is that there are only 100,000 shares and that the hash power they represent is simply a divider of the total hash power.  The shares grow in hash power as the company adds equipment. 
A few weeks ago, the share holders voted that 50 percent of the BTC that is made from mining is put back into new equipment in order to maintain somewhere around 1% of total hashing power.  
What we don't know is how they plan on upgrading and when they plan on doing so as well as a bunch of other technical stuff.  They have been solid so far though which is not reason to trust them, but the logic of the business plan is solid.  I bet this turns out in favor of P2P so I would certainly continue to look into them and look for more details of plans.

If someone is compromised with their PGP keys backed up in a non encrypted manner, they are shooting everyone in the foot.

They can make money both up and down that way and make a ton doing so.  They would just have to have enough mining power to move the market for 12 months strait.

How do I quote?
In the case of a malicious miner forking the coin in a way that created more coins, the fork would fail even if they carry more than 50% because the rest of the network would choose not to participate.  The second you start messing with the total number of BTC or BTCD or any other alt, is the second you get people to actively go against what you are doing.  In that case, it would be just as damaging to BTC as it would be to an alt because the community would choose to not use your fork.  And that is not just a fork in the mining process, that is a fork in the code base which is a different thing. 
Regarding 51% attacks...
You don't seem to have a good picture of how things would really happen under a 51% attack.  For the moment, imagine someone buys enough hardware to do a 75% attack so that they can really be guaranteed to do damage consistently.  51% doesn't get you consistency, and it also doesn't get you complete destruction.  If you were to attack the network with enough to completely bring it to its knees, it doesn't matter if miners lose revenue or not.  At that point, we are talking about complete destruction of the network.  As in bitcoin would fail. At that point, if you change the algorithm to exclude the attacker, it doesn't matter, because your system is toast.  You instantly loose value and utility in giant orders of magnitude.  If you are talking about changing the system on that level, it wouldn't matter whether it was POS or POW.  The result would be the same.

This censorship is very very bad.  Why can't I read comments and info related to the actual tweet but I can read this?  This is horrible and whoever is doing this should be ashamed.  I am a long time member of this sub, and I don't comment on these issues much, but this type of censorship is making me want to learn more about why a company like coinbase would want to make a decision like this. 
Coinbase isn't the greatest company in the world, but they are also responsible for the majority of normalization that bitcoin has had in the American media and thus in the world.  What they do is important to the community as a whole and should be discussed as such.  It is irresponsible to not give their actions serious consideration in all public forums and shows that whoever is making the decision to keep this news from the public eyes is making questionable decisions.

If you think the only reason libertarians, anarchists, and the others who adopted bitcoin early on is because of solving some kind of technological issue, you are delusional.
The reason we are behind bitcoin is because the previous system concentrated power into the hands of people who could abuse it and use it with threat of violence to control.  If bitcoin becomes a system where people can abuse power and enslave, then we will create a better and stronger system.  
This is like the battle between govt and torrents but on steroids and in a way more important context.  People's lives and livelihoods are on the line, and those of us who understand what is going on will never accept being held at the point of gun and being extorted for a portion of the product of our labor.  This may not be a libertarian or alt culture fad now since it has developed so widely, but just like the republicans in the last two elections, bitcoin needs us to succeed.

Purse.io uses the "wish list" feature of amazon.com.  This feature allows you to create a wish list and then to broadcast a sharable link to the world - similar to how a gift registry for a wedding would work.  Amazon uses this feature to allow gifts to be bought without the person receiving the goods being able to find out who the purchaser is. 
This feature is a policy that makes sense for Amazon, and it effectively separates the person receiving the item from the person who used the credit card.

I would generally say you could shift that to much higher figures very safely.  Physical transactions will be on camera at stores that sell stuff for more than 1000 dollars.  Also, the probability of someone double spending is extremely low.  They would have to be one of the few individuals who control a major mining pool to have any high probability of that.  The FBI would quickly get involved and that person would get in serious hot water fast.  The attempts at this type of behavior in physical locations would quickly stop.
If it were an internet transaction, then yes, wait for confirmations.  
@_date: 2014-09-11 21:20:02
I understand both of them very thoroughly.  Unlimited forks being mined makes no difference as long as their is consensus generated about which fork is important.  As I said before, consensus is generated in a lot more ways than just mining.  Also, in proof of stake, whats the purpose of mining other forks.  You'll process no transactions on forks which are not being used, and then you'll generate little to no stake as stake is based on network weight (ownership x participation in propagation).  Also that stake will be useless.
I think you are thinking about mining proof of stake just like mining proof of work where you can dump massive power to solve blocks and then generate the chain in exchange for reward.  Proof of stake requires you to actively participate in the network, and if there is no one on your fork of the network, you will generate no stake.  The formula is basically your total coin x number of days online x network participation.  = probability to find a block.  So even people with small amounts of coins get paid out as long as they are processing transactions.  Someone who creates their own fork would process no transactions and would gain nothing from it.

I wouldn't do any person to person transactions without meeting face to face in a public location and with cash and BTC both traded clearly.

Where are you getting this from? I have never seen any kind of successful "fake" transaction that can be broadcast.  The receiver can check the transaction math to make sure it was done right, and check the outputs and inputs instantly to make sure there are funds in the address and that addresses are valid.  
If you want to talk about double spends, thats a different story, but its certainly not something that could be or would be carried out for any small level fraud.  A real double spend would be a serious breach of the network and would mean a great deal of resources and time would be required to make happen.  If people manage it in the future, it is not going to be done for a small amount of value... meaning that even multi million dollar transactions would be fine, even though you would obviously wait for the confirmations.  I would personally make a client wait for a confirmation if I was dealing with either an internet charge, or a $5k plus transaction.  
If face to face, just get cameras.  If you have the capacity to defraud a bitcoin transaction, you will be one of very few people in the world.

You can sign transactions entirely offline, and each time you sign, I believe it creates a unique signature, so I am not sure how you could issue commands to the controllers of the signature system.  A person still has to physically take a usb drive or even a piece of paper and bring the necessary info to a separate and non internet connected physical location to generate a signature. 
Assuming that they only sign offline which I am fairly certain they do, this gives coinbase a sort of buffer in case all of their online operations are breached.  They could lose everything they have online and still not lose the customers bulk of coins.  This multi-layered approach comes from planning for the unplanned.  Make it so that even though your security is as high as you can possibly make it, you are still protecting your customers by considering that your security can be breached.  This is the only way I would feel confident in a system that is this important to the future of crypto.

Your expression is incorrect.  You don't need to say that .0000001 xbt trades at $5000/xbt.  You only need to say 1 xbt is trading at $5000.  
You can pick the exchange as long as it is a reputable U.S. dollar exchange, and I am not trying to pull anything on you.  If some fluke happened where the value spiked 5000% for 1/10 of a second because of some error, that is not what I am talking about.  I am saying that the real value will rise above $5000 for 1 BTC.

They will do exactly what this guy did.  Go to a public forumn and people like myself read and keep it in mind when I decide how to transact in the future.  You don't "have" to argue every stupid technicality in existence.
Also, you act as though this guy was proven to have sent bitcoin to a weed dealer.  He wasn't proven to do anything and he claims to not know anything about anything illegal.  If he didn't do anything illegal then he is justifiably angry and this post is an example of how coinbase is already losing face in a public way.  And this is just the first example.

Thanks NSA for downvoting truth. 
Snowden's release detailed a critical problem with tor nodes which cannot be worked around.  In addition, it detailed several other alternative issues with the network.
Primarily, the NSA compromises TOR by 3 main methods
1.  Running a large amount of the fastest and most powerful nodes on the network.
2.  Targeting competing nodes for hacking using man in the middle attacks as well as other attacks that feed as much info to the NSA as possible.
3.  DDOS'ing competing nodes to force traffic through NSA controlled nodes.
There is shit tons of evidence that the NSA has even more access than just controlling entry and exit nodes.  What I have just said is the tip of the iceberg.  Proof can only be seen by those willing to see.

Mining power balancing out between different a few different players is the current mode.  Once a government decides to take over mining, things will change.  Currently the U.S. government could spend a little over 5 billion dollars which is little more than a drop in the ocean for them to control all mining.  Once they did, they could make it such that other miners had no chance.

I think the issues I am referring to are when something goes wrong with code that creates some unknown error.  With a human element, it can be solved by a hopefully unbiased human judge and theoretically coin can be redistributed.  With a peer to peer system run entirely in computers this type of mediation is not possible which is why the code needs to be solid.
As far as alts, you are right, but in some cases, alts would let individuals bypass local laws.  Remember when some of the online poker sites were shut down?  I can't imagine that happening if there was a peer to peer backbone and identity obscuring tech like zerocoin on Anoncoin, or bitcoinDark with its teleport system.  
In those cases, it might be worth using BTCD style instadex which would give ability to rapidly and easily move to the currency of the gambling site again without trusting third parties.  This would eliminate possible government action against people wanting to move money in and out or platforms that support those behaviors.

How exactly does he use seignorage in the context of bitcoin?  The difference in cost between the mining reward plus fees compared to the value of the coin?  Isn't that essentially a free market function where if the cost to mine coins and transaction fees were not paying for miners costs, then they would stop mining?  
Is he is trying to say that the network will be reduced in security because enough miners will stop mining that they will allow a single entity to take over?  I am not exactly clear here.

The difference is that this specific IPO is being created by highly trusted people who were important and are important to the BTC community.  At this point, an investment in ether is an endorsement of belief in their ability to succeed with this idea.

The problem is that whatever the user base ends up migrating to will have to have enough power to mitigate the power that the bad player had, or they will have to change the protocol enough such that a consensus is formed around an algorithm that negates the bad player's power advantage.  Other wise, the bad player could just continuously divert his power to whatever new coin develops until he takes over a majority again.  
Obviously this is a serious problem any way you look at it. Bitcoin could change, but it never will because miners have too much at stake to let things change.

You don't need 99% of hashrate.  You need enough hashrate to successfully do something malicious enough and public enough that it causes BTC prices to crash.  The strategy would be simple... Buy enough mining power to commit a high profile doublespend attack.  At the same time, short the market heavily.
You could cause enough of a problem so that the value would be reduced enough to make you rich, while still keeping the network intact so that you could either continue to use or sell your mining equipment.

You said this already but it isn't true.  Since Jason Applebaum and the like gave us detailed information about how far the NSA is willing to go to collect information, the proponents of security and freedom have gone even further in the opposite direction.  Look at linux now.  You can actually run a Linux OS on your laptop or PC that is badass and very secure from the ground up.  Sure the NSA attempts to implant hardware backdoors, but people have wised up to that as well at the top levels. 
On the bottom levels, even though people are ignorant, they are still talking about things, and that is a significant step.  We will see exactly what needs to happen ... happen, and soon.  There will be open fabrication units, and self fabrication through 3d printing, as well as fully open software, as well as completely new and privacy oriented protocols.  And they will be so simple to use that people won't know they are doing anything special.
These things will happen because the progress people are making in those fields is impossible to stop.  Linux will only continue to get better and more accessible to the common man while remaining free.  The free market place will provide better and cheaper tools for custom self fabrication because they will be cheaper and better than going and buying the latest Iphone.  We are already seeing the first wave of the new protocols, but when machines are redesigned from the ground up, everything will move way faster for the privacy crowd.

A mobile device that shows QR codes that connects wirelessly to central computer.  Every order or tab is input in the wireless device or the central computer.  They should work either way and both should have user interfaces that easily can take orders nearly instantly.  As the order is taken, a dynamically moving QR code is generated specifically for that order.  This will happen instantly as the order is created.  The person ordering scans the code, broadcasts his transfer, and your computers (both wireless handheld and central) both show a "receiving" symbol that at least recognizes the transaction is supposed to be occurring.  Between the time the guy scans and the network responds with the receiving notice, the bartender is making the drink.  By the time bartender comes back with the drink the "receiving" notice better be happening or the customer doesn't get shit.

The biggest problem I see for something like this is that it is web based and as such is exposed to security flaws being exploited on a system wide scale.  Imagine what kind of impact this would have to the mass adoption of bitcoin if this company's security is breached and users connected through facebook experience theft or worse on a mass scale.  The impact this kind of hack could have on Bitcoin's mass perception and adoption could negate any benefit from having such a high profile and easy way to use BTC.
I am not saying that this is a bad idea, I just really hope that security is done on the level that coinbase or other offline / online companies are doing and that the company is run by legit people.  If something goes wrong with such a high profile application, it could be even more catastrophic than Gox.  When someone builds something like this, they must understand that they are cornerstones of bitcoins future and if they are created imperfectly, they can set things back for everyone by years.

Litecoin has less riding on it now, so they can more readily adapt the newest technologies.  If Litecoin wants to remain relevant they should adopt a policy of being a late beta stage testbed for BTC that actually has a big enough user base to be significant.  
I believe in litecoin and many others do as well, but the fact that there are many people using it is at the moment its biggest selling point. If it wants to continue to see lots of people using it, I'd like to see it push the envelope rather than just being a 'slightly' faster version of BTC on a different crypto algorithm...  Why not integrate zerocash like anoncoin did, or adopt teleports from BTCD?  Why not become more experimental?  What is there to lose?

All the negatives you point out are applicable to POW as well.  
Also, I am not sure why you are talking about inflation here.  Inflation is not the issue as it is hard programmed into the algorithms and you can assess them yourself as they are open source if the coin is worth anything.
When security of a crypto-coin network is assessed you have to think about things from a cost of attack standpoint.  Right now if you wanted to attack the bitcoin network, you could do so by purchasing hardware.  You would need to purchase or control enough hardware to equal more than 50% of the network, but there would be a specific cost associated with that.  It would cost you a lot of money.  But once you control that level of power, you could then attack the network in a number of ways.  The issue with POW is that after you did this, your hardware is still good.  You could then sell the hardware or point it at a different coin.  You haven't lost a thing, and you could even profit from shorting the market in the meantime.  
In Proof of stake, in order to attack the network, you would need to hold more than 50% of the actual coin.  So if you act maliciously you would kill your own value by destroying something that you hold and then can't dump.  It also promotes participation in the network because you can't gain stake if you don't run a node.  So, you have a lot more regular participants.  You don't need an ASIC to run a node, you just need any shitty machine with a internet connection.  
It also reduces power across the board because you aren't wasting work on ridiculously difficult problems.  
The only argument against proof of stake that actually makes sense is that it concentrates wealth.  But the same is said right now for bitcoin where we are seeing more and more concentration of mining power into fewer and fewer hands.

I would second the Mycelium app, but understand that any person to person trade can be risky.  Get the mycelium app and then send me a message on here and I will send you a few bits to play with on the tip app here on reddit.  Practice with those and try to send your mycelium wallet some bits from the tip i leave you.  If you have any questions, let me know.  Once you understand how it works, then you will feel a lot more confident in doing a deal like this face to face.  If you call me, I can talk you through some of the steps as well.  Just PM for info.

One solution I would recommend is to have periodic notifications that link to instructions on how to upgrade security.  Perhaps have these periodic notifications also be triggered every time a persons account goes over a certain amount that could be considered non-trivial.  Perhaps if someone tries to put over $20 worth of BTC into their wallet without the upgraded security, they would be given a BOLD notification that tells them in demanding terms that they upgrade security.  
Also, for the bulk of people who don't upgrade their security, why not just follow coinbases model and have a cold wallet with geographically distributed M of N key system.  Make it so it is impossible for the entire system to go down at once.

I suspect that the correlation (if real) is due to a large number of people thinking similarly about these types assets as investments.  However, I would disagree with their assessment and would advise you to not expect long term correlation.  Bitcoin is so different because it is not just the commodity/ currency element that most people understand it as.  It is both a network and the currency element, and the network element is extremely important... perhaps even more important than the currency itself.

When he says "sweep" it, he means to move the bitcoins into your own wallet.  Right now the person who gave you those bitcoins probably still has access to them.  Although this probably doesn't matter because they are probably a cool person... It is also possible that they might eventually think that you threw away their gift and then reclaim the bitcoins.
To properly secure the coins, you should control all related information regarding security.  This is not hard, but you will probably have to spend a little while learning how to manage your own security.  It is so worth it to learn though.

Hardware wise, not everyone is compromised.  Samsung is one of many options, and that pool is ever growing.  Software wise, things are getting better.  People will not accept permanent control and permanent intrusions as they better understand technology.  When digital technology becomes so commonplace that grandmothers are hip to the newest gadgets, the mindset about privacy will shift.  New protocols will be built from the ground up to provide privacy because the same fundamental freedoms that the constitution defined as basic to being human are just that... basic to being human.  People just don't realize they are being denied those freedoms because they are too ignorant about the technologies to see how the denial of those freedoms actually impacts them.  As people become more connected to the technologies, there will be a massive push toward restructuring base protocols toward privacy and security.  
Bitcoin was a huge step in the sense that it provides inherent security, but it is so far a massive failure in that it doesn't provide inherent anonymity.  It will either be fixed eventually, or it will be replaced.

Be creative man, this isn't that hard to come up with.  It is the future after all.
Say you color a coin to represent a title of a $3000 car.  Then I color a coin to represent ownership of all my guitar gear.  Then my dad colors a coin to represent a trust he made with a $500K fund for his grand kids.  Joe the neighbor just encoded the deed to his house in the block chain as a way to keep it from his soon to be ex-wife.  Joe blow decided to use colored satoshis as a way to represent grams of gold and then start a small business where he keeps the gold in his bank vault and gives out satoshis as proof of ownership.  Jane Doe decides that she is going to start a business that executes contracts automatically on the penny stock market for small investors and she is going to use satoshis as redeemable payout certificates that can be collected at any of her retail stores. 
All of these items are very small in value, but if people all over start doing these types of things, collectively they could add up to far more than the underlying value of the bitcoins they are carried on.  Each of these items only requires one satoshi to transfer them; Yet each of them potentially represents hundreds or thousands of dollars.  If a bunch of different people decide to do this, the value carried on the blockchain will be far greater than the value of the actual coins.

This is not a problem.
Confirmations are meaningless in any person to person exchange.  For someone to pull off a double spend, they would have to control enough of the network hashing power to guarantee they are responsible for finding multiple blocks in a row.  Even with a large amount of total hashing power in your control, the likelihood of this is low enough that predicting the specific moment when you need to perform your double spend would be impossible.  
And if you somehow pulled it off, you would be on camera.  As you would be one of a very small group of people in the world who controlled enough hashing power to pull something off, you would quickly find yourself in hot water.  No one would attempt this in a person to person situation.  
In a internet based purchase, confirmations can be waited for.

Market price is what people are willing to pay.  If I have a prepaid visa card that someone gave me as a gift, and I want bitcoin, I can either try to sell that card for cash on craigslist or something else that is a pain in the ass, or I can use purse.io and buy bitcoin directly via their awesome interface.  I can also CHOOSE to buy the bitcoin at 30% above market, or I can choose not to.  In many cases, the price above market is 10% to 25%, and if there are people selling BTC with a smaller markup, I will choose them first.  But if I really want BTC and I don't want to go out of my way, then yes, I would pay 30% above market... especially on lower value items when I am only buying .05 BTC or so.  This isn't about 30% discounts being almost certainly illegal, it is about how much someone is willing to pay over market value for BTC for the ability to use a credit card.

@_date: 2014-12-24 06:20:03
That is ridiculous.  You aren't responsible for cash after you give it to someone else, and this is the same type of scenario.  No one can realistically be held responsible for what happens to something that is fungible after it leaves their hands unless they can be proven to be actively  and knowingly participating in or assisting the illegal activity.  KYC and AML laws mean checking behavioral patters to make sure your customers are following the law, but they don't mean that either the customer or coinbase could get in trouble for something that this guy reasonably has no knowledge of.  
He is getting fucked because coinbase is currently the best way to buy coins in the U.S. unless you have a sub 1% fee BATM nearby, and it sucks to not be able to use their services because of something that he can reasonably say had nothing to do with him.

My usual line of conversation opening is something like "maybe someday soon you will be able to pay with bitcoin and won't have to deal with this anymore."  Almost everyone responds by saying oh that would be great... wait whats bitcoin?  Hundreds of people have gained at least a tertiary knowledge of the system because of this. 
@_date: 2014-05-30 22:54:19
This is very easy to imagine.  One example could be if an app is released that allows people to imprint legal documents to the blockchain.  Someone could attach a will, a trust fund, or a deed to a high value property to a single satoshi.  The value of these types of properties could be enormous.  Imagine if someone attached a deed to a large business or high value property to a single satoshi.  Many businesses dwarf the size of the entire bitcoin market cap.  In this instance, it would be possible to instantly add billions to the value of that single satoshi while not increasing the price of bitcoin whatsoever.  
This problem could also be created by many smaller value additions being put into the block chain as well as many other ways. 
Mining power is currently proportional to value of the total bitcoins because of the proof of work system it exists on.  Proof of work has nothing to do with value found in additions to the chain and therefor miners will not scale directly as they do now.  Also, you will find that it will be impossible to accurately represent value stored in the chain.
This will lead to massive differences between hashing power which secures the network and the actual value stored in the network.  
The authors solution was to remove the coin coloring features and implement them through alt currencies or side chains, or to change from the proof of work system.

I am not sure how this has much to do with the fact that people using bitcoin will "believe" they are anonymous.  Nobody believes BTC is anonymous except idiots.  Zerocoin or future variations will be implemented and become ubiquitous for those who are "libertarians (bullshit word)".  We will just hold other alts because we actually care about privacy.  
We started the BTC movement, and if the government becomes more centralized on a world scale, they will only become more bureaucratic and will thus be even less effective on a micro scale.  We will win, and they can't stop us.  If BTC becomes a tool of the idiots in charge, we will simply pull a bunch of value out of it and then move on to better things.  The global controllers can't win.  They can only hope to keep themselves in power.

Of course I'd love to be paid in bitcoin for a nice middle class job, but of course in that case you would have to go through a bank.

Dude relax.  Things are being worked on.  Ten years from now, you will be able to 3d print your own processors even if they aren't very fast.  Technology is rapidly changing, and the common man's mindset is also shifting.  The fact that even common people know about the methods the government is using to take away privacy is great, and it means that there are some very smart people actively creating solutions.  Also, new info leaks are happening more frequently now.  So, things will change.  In the meantime, there some good software solutions that can act as buffers and make the government spend a whole bunch more money to do the same thing they are now.  Start by OTR encrypting chats, just that one act means they have to spend a whole bunch more money and personal attention to get stupid conversations from you that hopefully aren't about illegal shit anyway.

From your linked article...
Snowden admitted that such tools will never guarantee foolproof privacy and anonymity for leakers, but that it can significantly mitigate the risks. At the same time, he said, these efforts also shouldn't be misunderstood as an attempt to completely eliminate government secrecy; rather, they are a kind of digital dissent which makes passive, dragnet surveillance – like the NSA program which collects the phone records virtually every American – incredibly difficult, and to discourage governments from over-classifying and concealing wrongdoing.
The logic of using tor for every day things like phone calls or other prevention of dragnet style surveillance only makes sense if the number of TOR nodes dramatically rises.  For critical anonymity, it should not be trusted at all at this point.

They should implement a system that will hard destroy the trezor if tampered with without access to a key they provide you in a BTC transaction and clearly signed by them.

I would sell and buy on openbazaar if it worked every time I used it.  The truth is they are in alpha mode and there is no way I am going to jump on board until they have packages for linux, mac, and windows that are just as easy to install as any other program, or at minimum, as easy to install as TOR bundle.  It needs to work every time in every scenario, and hopefully fully sandbox itself automatically regardless of how stupid the user is.  They should force a peer to peer implementation of coinshuffle and with multisig outputs automatically built in, but as easy and as clear to use as paypal. 
It needs to be ultimately solid in both interface and implementation, or they will fail to be anything.  I too am skeptical.

I don't believe you would lose customers.  
I have a secondary solution though. Set it so that the maximum BTC that can be returned is the amount they gave you in the case of a value up situation.
Your return policy would be presented to your customers clearly with 3 possible scenarios as follows.
BUYER RETURN AGREEMENT:
In the event of
1. VALUE NEUTRAL SCENARIO: Buyer is returned exact cash or BTC depending on preference. 
2. VALUE DOWN SCENARIO: Someone pays 1 BTC for fridge worth 1000 dollars.  BTC drops and 1.3 BTC is now equal to $1000.  Customer receives option to take back their original 1 BTC OR $1000.  This way using your service as a hedge is dis-incentivised.  
3. VALUE UP SCENARIO; Someone pays 1 BTC for fridge worth 1000 dollars.  1 BTC goes up in value to 1200... customer gets paid back $1000 or .8 BTC.
In either case they have both the cash option and the BTC option.  In a BTC value up scenario is the only way they risk a return of a smaller amount of BTC. and at no point does your business ever risk needing to return a higher quantity of BTC.  Also, if the customer chose to accept return in BTC in a value down scenario, your company would actually make a small amount of money.

That is the basic theory behind why someone wouldn't do something like that, but the reality is that they would need a hell of a lot of hashing (computing) power to really pull something like this off, and then they would need to get very lucky at the same time.  Double spends are not easy in bitcoin world and there are a hell of a lot of technical layers that make it that way.  I would feel fully confident in taking any purchase below several thousand dollars over the counter without waiting for a confirmation, and if I were on the internet where I couldn't have cameras on someone, I just wait for a confirmation.

Bitcoin has been successfully attacked in the past, and just like peercoin, it was fixed.  Having problems is not a problem in itself as long as the development community is healthy enough to address them quickly.

There are no real laws or licenses relating to linux because the concept is just stupid.  However, this stupid license they are trying to stamp on BTC is due to a lack of understanding of the reason BTC exists and an inherent need by greedy political types to regulate everything relating to money so that they can get their hands on some of it.  They will likely succeed and fail at the same time.  BTC is a launch pad even if it never makes it to the moon.

Well, I think that your point is correct about in person transactions, and essentially regarding new keys.  The problem is that if it becomes adopted as normal, most of the world will not be buying them with cash nor will they be generating offline wallets.  If only .0001% of the world do such things, it is easy for the NSA and similar organizations to target those people just like they target individuals who run tor nodes now.  Just like if you run a tor node, they simply commit a much higher level of individualized attention to hack you personally.

Fees to miners vs fees to third party is a clear win to fees for miners because you don't have to trust anyone.  
The technical aspects of how to accomplish this may be very challenging though because you essentially cannot have mess-ups since there would be no third party to arbitrate.  That is the benefit of systems like betMoose, but those systems will eventually be replaced entirely by peer to peer systems and that will start the gambling revolution.  No way to shut that down no matter what nazi hell hole you live in.

No one would ever require a confirmation for a physical purchase unless it was a huge amount of money.  This is a myth, and even then your premise is incorrect because confirmations rarely occur 10 minutes apart.  Most blocks are mined at an average of 10 minutes apart but often take way less or way more time.
Regardless, confirmations are not necessary for 99% of face to face sales.

This is a great article.  I suppose bitcoin could be sent to ebay which holds it and then forwards it when shipment is confirmed... or something similar.  Ebay provides value as a go between for consumers and sellers, not as a money transfer service.  Paypal is the money transfer service, but if they could  integrate bitcoin on the back end, they could stand to save themselves a lot of money.  This allows them to either profit more or be in a better position to compete with others who offer similar services. 
The one question I have for both of them is how do they lower exposure to volatility while still providing go between (money holding) services or using bitcoin on the backend of their payments system.  
The only way I see this happening is if they and a number of other companies bought in heavy enough to bring relative stability to price. 
@_date: 2014-10-18 05:36:11
I'd put 10 coins into a bunch of alts that show promise.  Then I would take about 300 coins and hire a bitcoin core developer to steal their technologies and integrate them into BTC, and watch my remaining BTC jump in value by hundreds of times.  Plus I'd still own a massive crypto portfolio and support development of the crypto-sphere by holding those as well as BTC.

This is my sentiment exactly. I have introduced many people to BTC through my phone and the fees are killer.  I am looking at things from the perspective of a person who guards every satoshi and the idiots in charge are forcing me to spend thousands of them every time I want to give someone a fucking dollar.  What is the point of focusing on fees to limit micro-transactions as opposed to just fixing the block chain to allow for free floating block size?  And now with the newest versions of QT, I am forced to send .0001 every bloody time?  This is ridiculous.  A personal vendetta about satoshi dice should not be killing my ability to send micro transactions to noobies who are interested in BTC.

That is a trade off that I go through every day.  For me saving money and building for my future is more important than having a new car.  However, if I didn't have a car now and I needed one, I would spend my bitcoins even though I truly believe they will be worth many multiples of what they are now. 
The thing is, the same issues could be said about any money.  Right now if you invest your money in your average low risk mutual fund, you will get an average return of 5 to 10 percent; but most people just don't.  Instant gratification is a powerful force.  
While bitcoin may mitigate some of the consumerism on a societal level, it won't keep people from buying what they need.  It may change things, but it won't freeze spending.  In the end savings is a choice and bitcoin doesn't really change that.

You must not understand how it works. It eliminates the incentive for malicious miners to attack the network by requiring ownership of the actual coin as opposed to just ownership of mining gear.

Modern browser finger printing techniques make it very easy to be unique even with generic settings.  Sandboxes are necessary for general public use.  Test your browser here even with generic settings...
I'm not sure a peer to peer server exists, but my concept is that the actual destination servers would be broken into millions of pieces so that like bittorrent, there is no server.  Just download a program similar to transmission and you participate in a botnet that hosts extremely small slices of websites, or databases, or whatever.  A big part of the problem that I see with sites like the pirate bay or some of these onion hidden sites is that there is a specific server in the first place.  Why not break the processing power as well as the storage up in a peer to peer fashion so that there is no specific target and distribute that into a million hands so that there isn't enough on any specific persons computer to cause them to get in trouble?

That was speculation, but they could do it.  It would just depend on how they did.  They would need to make their own factories and fabricate their own chips.  IT would be possible for a government to spend a trillion on this just to squash bitcoin, and they could succeed.  
The reason I brought this up though is that proof of stake eliminates a lot of the issues with mining because it requires the users to actually hold the coin itself.  If you buy up 50% of a currency and then do something malicious to it, you are just shooting yourself in the foot.

If you had said that the minimum tip should be just above what someone can actually send on the blockchain including the fee, then you MIGHT have something to discuss, but micro-tips are great for me and for most others here in the BTC community.  I tip larger when I leave this community's subs, but that is a personal choice because I want to encourage adoption, and it certainly wouldn't apply to everyone or every circumstance.

The initial investment is in the purchase of goods that you will then sell.  If you hold bitcoin from only your profits, you will always recoup your initial investment of fiat as fiat.  This will allow your business to remain solvent regardless of what fluctuations may occur in the price of BTC. 
I would expect that they will issue returns using BTC, but as a business owner, I would want to take some percentage of profits as BTC for speculative purposes. This would be completely related to my personal aversion to risk as an owner.

His argument is that proof of stake does not give incentive to consensus mining.  That is illogical because without consensus your coin fails.  Consensus comes from many things, not just mining.

Give me a fucking break.  Who cares if coinbase is not technically an "exchange?"  That semantic is irrelevant to my bet.  The entire point is that I strongly believe BTC will exceed $5000 US dollar value according to a trusted and major dollar to BTC exchange.  Coinbase does exactly that.  If you don't like coinbase, I would be glad to go by MTgox.  It doesn't matter to me because I believe ALL of the big "exchanges" will be over $5000.
Now what about my terms is bogus?  It is pretty strait forward.  If you don't believe the value of 1BTC will exceed $5000 during 2014 and you are willing to put .1 BTC on that belief, then take the bet.   If you win I will pay you .1BTC.  If I win, you pay me .1BTC.  How is this anything but strait forward terms?

Ethereum can be currency as well.  The OP's point is valid.  If bitcoin can't adjust to the markets demands as fast as Ethereum or whatever new coin is out, it will lose market share and thus lose its first mover and security advantage.  This is obviously not something that would happen over night, but it certainly could happen over the course of many years.  
Hell, one major issue in bitcoin could cause billions to exit the market.  Some of those billions would move to other crypto systems.  Bitcoin's response to this type of scenario is the determinant factor to its survival.  How fast can it adapt?

You might be right, but it will be very very difficult for anything to beat it out because of its ability to adapt.  BTC can change if some clearly better technology comes along.  The other coins end up acting like enormous testbeds for bitcoin, and due to bitcoins network size, the security is way way higher for bitcoin.  In the end, it will have to adapt, and that might be difficult because certain people are so invested that they will fight those changes, but if they don't change, the likelihood of BTC being beat goes up.

This was from 2007.  Their strategy was plain then, and I guarantee it has gotten stronger since...  Create nodes with high speed and high throughput and hack the nodes that compete.

If they can control the nodes from the input through the output, there is a good chance they can put together enough of the traffic to make it pointless.

I disagree.  16nm technologies and possibly lower will replace the current bulk of the network which operates at 28nm.  At that point, the network will rapidly begin to grow again until it reaches a similar plateau as the less efficient miners begin to drop off due to price falling.
The interesting thing is that as these miners are released into the wild, they will have the effect of driving down prices until the network begins to reduce in size, then the price will bounce and some of those old miners will be able to jump back in, again forcing prices down.  Its a pretty sick pattern that technology will play with prices until successive halvings cause demand to be more of a factor than the miners.
I do think that this plateau in the mining power could indicate a supported bottom in the price (supported by the interplay between profitability in mining being eliminated by price reduction in a significant portion of the network).

You are way over analyzing this.  I have run a business before and have no formal background in economics or finance.  
I look at things in a very simple way.  If my business has made back what my costs are, then I can continue my business.  This means that I can remain solvent in my mind.  If there is some other technical term for it, I could care less.
If I am making profit... that is money I make beyond my costs of business, I would absolutely consider investing that money in many different ways depending on my level of aversion to risk.  Personally I would be willing to invest my business profits in BTC because I am willing to take risk.

I wonder if they would give the option to lock in price or to allow your account to be charged dynamically based on market price.

That is kind of a problem with a bitcoin system in this case because it would be extremely easy to create new addresses and make tons of donations with no real way to keep track of who is who.
My idea would be to operate the site in two different systems.  One that is click to play, and still allows you to tip artists through the traditional bitcoin system, but doesn't give you the ability to upvote or downvote... AND another that requires you to sign in to upvote, tip, and generally create a music listening profile for you.  It would have a generic public facing music player that plays the top 200 songs or so automatically with advertisements and allows direct blockchain based tips, but internally it would be similar to pandora without advertisments and with a micro-tipping system. 
If this is done right it could be amazing for all parties and users could get free bits for tipping when they sign up - funded by revenue from the public facing site's adds.  Of course users could charge their accounts with bits in order to access more content or in order to tip artists within the system.

So by some rough calcultions, at current prices of around .022 per share, this seems like it should be a profitable venture pretty quickly even with the current rate of decline in relative hashpower as difficulty scales.  
For example.  Shares have generated a fairly predictably declining return.  Since the full rollout of the current hashrate.  The dividends have been.
Each represents a decline relative to the difficulty increase which happens at fairly predictable intervals.  The total period for these four dividend payments was 28 days.  A decrease in the total amount of coin was also seen during each period of dificulty change.  At first, the amount of coins mined was higher, and as they continue, the amount will drop until they pay off their loan.
So far since full implementation, they have mined per week.
402.33900756 
If this pattern holds, we can expect roughly 2 weeks of similar performance followed by a drop of 40 to 50 coins.
The next group should look something like
Now an important event is when they can pay off their loan.  At this rate, the payments toward the loan and hosting costs (assuming current bitcoin prices) which is also the amount paid out in dividend should be...
110  next friday 
That leaves the loan -82 BTC at the end of the next 28 days.  
They should also completely pay off the loan in about 42 days.
At that point, they could sell equiptment for a nice profit, or use the money from the sale to reduce the cost of the future loan and rebuy new equiptment --- which is what their bylines state they will do.  
The sustainability is the critical issue here.  The major question that should be asked about my calculations is relating to the linear nature of my reduced return schedule.  If a major exponential increase happens in the difficulty within the next 6 weeks (and depending on when it happens within those 6 weeks), the payoff period could be longer.  I cannot forsee a scenario where the loan could not be paid though, so as far as I can see, this should be sustainable project that results in a continual dividend for share holders.
Back to dividends...
If the dividend reduction follows the reduction rate so far seen over the next 6 weeks, we should see something that looks like this
Afterwards, the dividend should go back up as the company reinvests profits and secures another loan.  So, someone buying in now at .025 or so will collect around .0049 in the next 6 weeks.  That amounts to about 19% of your initial investment which is a rediculous return for a month and a half.  
Now opperating from the assumption that the company will keep their word and rebuy new equiptment, the shares should at worst remain stable at costs above .2 even as the company sees reduced dividends toward the end of the cycle as long as they show indications that they are planning on continuing the hash rate increase as initially proposed.  If they do this it is possible that we could see much increased share rates even as they regear for the next round.  
This could turn out to be an excellent investment.

Final value sale fees are 10%.  Listing fees are between 1% and more if you want special features and a reserve set such that you don't lose money.  PayPal's fees are typically 2.9% + $0.30 USD per transaction, but may vary.  Shipping is more expensive than it should be although most people charge the buyer for shipping.  
Also, some low demand things just don't sell.
It is probably not worth your time and effort for an approx. 15% profit.
@_date: 2014-06-21 22:45:48
Wouldn't a fixed reinvestment written into the company design sorta guarantee at least a fixed increase in hash rate compared to a company who can arbitrarily decide when to invest in gear?  Obviously that company will want to make the best decisions or it will get put out of business but it is kinda up to the company operators.  On the other hand a reinvestment strategy should force the company to at least keep up with the market and if it gets lucky and snags some cheaper than market hash value or builds it itself, then you get a little premium like you said.
Seems like it isn't a bad idea at least.

er no.  The reason we don't have to worry about gunmen running down the streets is because we all have guns.  The people worrying about gunmen running down streets are people without guns.  
The good news is that in a short time, you can have a drone watching your street for you to give you advanced notice if a gunman is running down the street, and to destroy that threat before he is even close to your location.... and you won't even have to personally participate in your own defense as the drone will do it for you.  Thank goodness the government gave us the model for protecting ourselves from all their wonderful behavior in the middle east.

This calculator allows you to factor in difficulty changes that you specify as well as your power / KW hour and gives you the ability to adjust BTC price.  Its only downfall is that it is in U.S. dollars.

One way to do it is to have a secondary phone and a secondary app and just scan the token on both phones.  Authy allows for backups to be made using a password (and I assume printed out?), but I usually just use two phones... one that is not in use and that is always in a safe location.

Which are both owned by the NSA.
@_date: 2014-07-21 08:27:10
This is simply not true.  The NSA was controlling enough entry and exit to eliminate anonymity for some portion of the network years ago...  What portions or percentage of the nodes are controlled by NSA was unknown then and is in even more serious question now.  
The concept of "using tor correctly" is completely irrelevant unless you are actively becoming a node and also actively making sure you aren't personally targeted and hacked by the NSA. 
We already know that the NSA can hack virtually anything they wish using a wide range of techniques, and in the case of TOR, they are doing just that against node administrators.  
No one should assume they are safe unless you are seriously a security badass and have full confidence in your security systems and are actively administering.  Even then, the security experts I know simply don't use TOR.  They use VPN's in different countries as well as other techniques.  
And those guys are such a limited amount of people that as a whole, it should simply be assumed that TOR is compromised.  Anyone who uses it under the presumption of anonymity is asking for trouble.

Another thing that I could see being interesting is if you target the demand from the audiophile community for high quality music.  Look at what just happened to Pono Player.  It got overfunded by 5 million dollars on its crowdfunding campaign.  The player is cool, but the awesome part of the system is that the content delivery is absolutely best quality available.  Even non audiophile people like myself are willing to pay for this type of content, and it would be great to be able to pay in BTC.  I am willing to pay for music from the Pono site because I get content of extreme quality directly from a legit source without hassle.  This is difficult or impossible through torrents and regular sites like amazon or whoever... at least for now.  Once the content comes out and becomes more widespread, it will be easier to obtain, but there are other ways to make money like cloud hosting peoples music collections and providing streaming services for a nominal fee (in BTC of course).  You could make it so that as people like songs on your streaming service, they can then buy the masters and you store them permanently for them while giving them full download rights. 
Geeky people like me love DSD, 24 bit audio, and high sample rates and I believe there is opportunity to develop a standard for high bandwidth multi channel audio or to sell whatever exists for those formats also.  I think the key to this would be constantly having the highest available quality at all times.  Develop a reputation for this on your music sales side and people will gravitate towards you naturally.

I can't imagine a situation where the underlying BTC is not valuable also.

The paper trail aspect of Bitcoin is one area that is currently being actively worked on.  It is already difficult to track as is, but will become even more so as HD wallets are adopted in mass and as adoption of digital currencies in general becomes more common place.  Then it will become very simple to bounce into a zero-knowledge proof style coin and bounce back to bitcoin.  
This may sound difficult, but the work that is being done right now will make things as simple as sending a text message.  Bitcoin at that point will be the equivalent to digital cash that can be sent any where in the world for no fee.   
On the question of getting paid in bitcoin and being able to buy stuff with bitcoin... that is going to take time.  But more and more retailers all over the world are accepting bitcoin every day and that means that more and more retailers will offer salary and payments in bitcoin every day.

What laws say that the government can prosecute you for something that someone else does that you have no idea about, and when you did nothing illegal to enable that person?


Is this a joke?  This doesn't work.  I have tried so many times.
So lets say you are right and that coinbase can do this?  How the hell are you supposed to protect yourself?  Do I have to use a mixer for every transaction I make?  I have no idea where any of the coin I have sent out has gone over the years other than the coin that I directly bought something with.  It would be naive to think that of all the coin that I have given away and sent out for legit transactions, that none of it has ever been used for illegal stuff.  So where and what defines the buffer zone? 
Does coinbase only go after you if there is one level of separation between you and the illegal stuff, or two, or three?  This is murky ground that has no clearly defined rules for a customer.  So what is the answer?  The concept of innocent until proven guilty should obviously be the prevailing attitude, but we know that isn't the case, so what exactly and specifically is the case?  The way it is now means that the policies have more potential to land people into not being able to use coinbases' service than they do to actually connect anything to illegal activity.  Especially when you consider how much nefarious activity and un-regulated activity happens with bitcoin.  This is a worldwide system after all and there are a lot of people doing a lot of things around the world with bitcoin.  
This doesn't seem reasonable at all.

@_date: 2014-12-24 04:20:28
I think that it is likely that you could break even with no power costs, but the issue is that there are several projected 16nm miners on the horizon for 2015.  If those releases happen correctly and without scams being involved, we may see a massive jump in difficulty that could dramatically change your 4 month break even to never.  It just depends on the timing of the technology being released and the quantity it is released in.  
@_date: 2014-07-08 00:44:37
This point is important to those who wish to do person to person transactions of low value.  This is made far more difficult with these changes and shifts bitcoin away from the concept of being a person to person digital cash to being a interprise level transfer tool.  It makes it far less accessible for much of the day to day business that actually occurs, and shifts a higher burdon to the consumer than in my opinion is logical.

Austin is pretty progressive and youthful / should be lots of tech savvy people there, so you might be able to find some people on mycellium local trader.  Circle.com can get you quick bitcoin with credit card, but there is a limit to how much they will let you buy, and if you have anything that creates a red flag in their books, they likely will put you through hoops to get BTC.  
1. First thing to do is sign up to circle if you have a credit card. 
2. Second thing is to immediately download mycellium on your phone (assuming you have android) and try to use the buy function from someone locally.
3. Third thing is to look on craigslist.
4. Fourth thing is to try localtraders.com
5. This won't solve your problem now, but the best way I have found to buy BTC in the states right now is coinbase.com.
You have to consider that bitcoin is non refundable and that is why it is difficult to get.  Normally, banks can pull money out of someones account if something goes wrong, but with bitcoin, no-body can save you if you got your coin stolen, or sent someone too much, or sent the wrong person the coin.  So, companies have to go to great lengths to protect themselves.  In the U.S. that means verifying bank info and background info for any purchase using credit cards...
It makes sense because if someone was using a stolen credit card to buy bitcoins, the bitcoin company is at risk of a chargeback from the bank while there is no way to get their BTC back.

Coinbase typically takes 4 to 7 days before they approve you unless you have an instant approval bank.  Then it takes 4 or 5 days to buy.  Cryptowall and similar put up a time limit where if you don't pay by the end of it, they delete the key and the data is gone forever.
While coinbase is awesome, it is not his solution.

The biggest negative bitcoin has as a problem is that public perception is fully one of a ponzi scheme.  Many people have sat and listened or even bought into a MLM scheme and those same people have wised up and are not going to make the same mistake.  So when they hear from one of their friends or from someone in the media that this is a ponzi scheme, it doesn't really matter what is the reality behind it.  They just view it as a ponzi scheme no matter what.  This public perception has caused people to not even conceptualize using bitcoin, or even worse to think bad of me because I asked for them to pay using bitcoin even where bitcoin would be far and away the best payment method available.
Bitcoin must overcome this perception in the public to succeed and I'd love to see the foundation push out some high profile advertisements that show its tech and its utility in a non ponzi scheme light.

They are very similar except two points.  The first is that the stake holder actually has to hold the coin which would lose value itself vs. mining in bitcoin where you could just hold mining equiptment and not lose any value at all.
The second is that you don't have to have computing power being wasted in the scale of BTC.  You can have more participation in the network which provides a higher level of security with FAR less use of power.

Coinbase is the safest of the online wallets if you ask me.  They have 97% of their coin in offline storage with geographically distributed multi part keys.

Again, that isn't how it works.  A fork in the block chain is different from a fork in the code base.  You would have to change the code to create inflation.  The same is the case in proof of stake.  Changing the code AND mining on the new fork would be necessary.  BTC supporters would not accept software that allows for inflation, and if they do, that is our cue to get out. 
Regarding the exclusion of an attacker, bitcoin would be destroyed or close to destroyed in the process if they chose to exclude someone specifically.  Fungability is so critical to currency that it would likely set bitcoin back behind a lot of the other alts which offer more complex systems.  Bitcoin is winning because it is good, but not because it is so much better than everything else that it couldn't be replaced.  In the case that bitcoin was no longer the front runner in market share because of some huge attack, it would not fight its way back to the front.

If the software is open source and vetted, it could theoretically be designed in such a way that the software could be trusted to create revenue, generate wallets, pay out necessary venders, pay out power automatically, etc... such that no human involvement was required.

First off, delete it.  You don't know how it could have been compromised.  It has not been supported by coinbase for a long time now and there have been all kinds of high level bugs that have come out in between the last time it was updated and now.  
Second, why aren't you getting an email when you make purchases?  I get an email immediately when I make a purchase or when I transfer money out of my account.  
Next, how are you talking about getting fees and whatnot on your bank?  I have tried to buy coin and did not have enough money in my bank account and the transfer simply did not work.  No coin was purchased.  This should be disputable from your bank and you won't be fined anything.

This is actually the most important factor because even if they never did this payout scheme, they would have likely broke even as planned about a month from now... Maybe even sooner since the difficulty has stagnated slightly.  So, they theoretically could return a nice profit if they adhere to their plan to increase GH/ share.  However, they have not done that.  Not exactly sure how this leaves shareholders in the long run, but it seems like it will pay out pretty good since they are breaking each share into 14 and then they should trade at market value.

Your responses are still silly which shows that you are getting more out of arguing on the internet than you should be.  
BTC has nothing to do with remaining solvent and I never said it did.  I have been talking about investing some of the money that is PROFIT into a high risk venture like bitcoin.  
Your arguments relating to the symantics of what is and isn't risk aversion are irrelevant.  My point was that a company could decide what percentage of profit to invest in BTC based on how risk averse the owners are.  This will forever remain true.  The owners of a company ultimately decide where to invest their profits and I can assure you that many large companies do in fact put some money into high risk investments both indirectly and directly.

From your own article:
"Snowden admitted that such tools will never guarantee foolproof privacy and anonymity for leakers, but that it can significantly mitigate the risks. At the same time, he said, these efforts also shouldn't be misunderstood as an attempt to completely eliminate government secrecy; rather, they are a kind of digital dissent which makes passive, dragnet surveillance – like the NSA program which collects the phone records virtually every American – incredibly difficult, and to discourage governments from over-classifying and concealing wrongdoing."
The logic of using TOR for every day activities won't exist until the number of nodes dramatically increases and the speed increases.  For critical anonymity, it should not be trusted at all.  For critical situations, TOR should never be trusted even if the number of nodes increases a thousand times.

There are not "many others" about purse being a scam.  There is one major thread that postulated that it would be a place for scammers to congregate.  
This is an example of a guy getting ripped off because he bought a gift card which could be revoked by Amazon.  There is a big difference between that and an order which is shipped to your door and in your possession.  And he even posted that Purse.io took the high road and is refunding the guy the money.  I don't work for Purse, but I can guarantee you they also removed the scammer's account.  Amazon is likely dealing on a different level with the account connected to the credit card that bought the order as well.  I am sure its a pain for them, but this service is certainly not the only one that creates an opportunity for scams via amazon, and it is also a service that increases sales at amazon dramatically and legitimately as well.
Just because someone (or more than one person) is committing fraud using a service doesn't mean the service is inherently bad.

Don't understand why this isn't a larger part of things.  Miners in large farms with direct access to new hardware are probably seeing $150 cost per bitcoin and can sell all the way down to that price.  I expect them to.  Eventually it will drive the less competitive miners out of market so their selling pressure will leave the market, but as soon as the price rises, the other miners will turn back on and the cycle will begin again.  This will continue until a demand case that is huge develops and the miners are incentivized to hold as many coins as possible... or until one or two more halvings occur.

You are right... If no newcomers exist, then the value will drop for sure.  But that does not change the utility of the coins for easy transfer of value with no fees and short wait times.  
FOr example, if the coins were only worth 1 dollar, but you needed to send $50K to japan, instead of buying a small amount of coins, you would just send a huge amount of coins.  The actual US $ value of BTC makes no difference to the person with the $50K because he put in his $50K, and sent it to japan, and it came out as $50k on the other end.  The person who sent the money doesn't care if a lot or a few BTC represented that $50K as long as they maintain their value long enough for the transfer and conversions to go through.

There is an entire thread about this.  If you tip someone, delete your copy of the private key, or make sure they know it expires after a realistic time frame (like a year)  It is entirely possible that someone could be just storing the key you gave them not knowing what it really is or currently wanting to invest the time to understand how to retrieve it... but you planted the seed.  And in a year or two when they are just hanging out with their girlfriend or whoever, and that person happens to mention bitcoin, they will remember it and say "oh I think I have some of that somewhere."  And if you swept it, it makes you the royal ass in that situation, because you took someones first experience and made it into a "oh shit, what I thought I had is not here any more."

Fees are not a problem right now, and they won't be until either the price is very low, or until the block reward is very low.  Right now miners are making a huge profit from the block reward, and the artificially imposed fee market is just extra. 
Additionally, the way to keep the miners mining once the block reward is too small is to grow the user base so dramatically that the fees per transaction are still extremely low, but there are enough transactions to keep the miners interested.  This isn't rocket science.

It uses the Amazon gift service, which essentially acts as a anonymous gift registry.  You can add items to your wishlist, publish it publicly, and if anyone wants to buy you something, they can.  If this service was such a bed of hackers and thieves as described here, Amazon would discontinue it.  Instead, they keep in place... Perhaps Amazon knows more about the level of fraud involved in this service than a bunch of random people on the internet with no statistics to back them and only a few reported cases of fraud?  I'd say so.

They need to be far more clear on what specifically defines compliant behavior.  Where exactly does someone cross the line when it comes to layers of separation?  Obviously someone can't be held responsible for every transaction that ever happens to a coin once it leaves your wallet, so where is the line?  Does coinbase have to have some reasonable level of suspicion that you were specifically linked to the nefarious activity, or can they just arbitrarily de-activate anyone remotely tied to anything illegal?  If so, wouldn't that mean that almost everyone would be deactivated except those few people who never sent any coin to anyone?
Seems like coinbase has some questions relating to specifics of their requirements to make far more accessible to the public.

People right now are reporting average per coin cost of about 250 bucks.  Some miners are more profitable, some are less.  I mined in 2015 and made over 150% profit from beginning to end after selling my hardware.  I also live in the U.S. with average power costs.  I also sold my equiptment too early.  I would have made significantly higher if I kept my hardware for 2 extra months. 
85% give or take per coin is just a guess, but it is somewhere in the range of 75% to 100% profit per coin, and more if you catch the hardware cycles correctly and sell your hardware at the right times.

Guess you missed the phase of bitcoin where one of the core principles was virtually non existent fees.  We bought and formed companies around a model that was based on the ideals of a free market system that didn't have artificially imposed boundaries.  One where speech was based around code and not controlled by internet trolls who happen to control forums.  A system where you could send your friend 2 dollars just because you wanted him to see how simple it was; where user base growth was critical enough that personal politics weren't even a question.  
No we didn't praise bitcoin as is, we shouted against the changes that got us here, and instead of listening, the people who control the forums propagandized against, kicked out, silenced, and stifled the opinions of a huge chunk of the community who didn't think like them.  That chunk of the community is pushing back now, and a pendulum of significant weight that comes with truth is swinging with them.

It is far worse that that.  The government could blacklist addresses and use allied countries to sanction those addresses.  If they use a mixer and those coins were mixed up with yours, then portions of your coin could become unusable or entire groups of coins could become unusable just because you went through a mixer.

Many are not.  Many are just good developers attempting to make a splash and bring features to the crypto world.  If you have some basic understanding of the technologies involved, and a little bit of understanding of how economics work, you can certainly see a lot of value in *some alts.  If not because you want to keep the alts... because you want to use the parts of the technologies that are advancements over BTC.    For example, anoncoin is about to implement a version of zerocoin into their system.  BitcoinDark is about to implement a system to anonymously transfer as well.  These two coins as well as several others are integrating next generation tech into their coins while BTC sits around in a very dangerous position of not having basic fungibility.  BTC needs to adapt, not just stagnate, or eventually the pie will be broken up so much that it will no longer be dominate. 
There are other examples also...  If I had a bunch of money, I would be funding developers and helping them bring some of these alt technologies into BTC core.

People are somewhat concerned about their exceptionally vague policies relating to the transfer of BTC and its consequences to its original purchasers from coinbase.  Basically people are saying they are getting their accounts shut down for sending coins to people who then use them for nefarious means.  Coinbase has not been specific about their policies.
As far as security though, they seem to be one of the best or possibly the best exchange out there.  They can be a bit slow if you are buying from a band, but they offer some awesome features such as multisig wallets where you control the keys, and their U.S. dollar system is nice because you can deposit dollars and instantly convert them back and forth between bitcoin and dollar if you leave the money in their system.  They are basically turning into a bank.

Absolutely true.  There should be development courses online for free teaching all the core aspects of bitcoin and how to program them.

@_date: 2015-01-26 15:15:08
That is because the fundamentals still haven't changed.  The demand doesn't match the amount of coin flooding the market every day from merchants converting to fiat and from miners dumping coin.  This price bump means that people don't have to sell quite as much coin as they are mining to pay for power, but they still have to sell a lot.  When those coins combine with the coin from merchants, that is a ton of coin hitting the market every day.  
@_date: 2015-01-22 23:20:32
There is a way around unique inputs being trackable, and that was the point of this thread in my mentioning zerocoin.  
Coinshuffle can work, and can work well under certain conditions, but those conditions need to become very well understood and the exact implementation of them needs to be followed in a precise manner by large groups of people for them to work.  Also, something needs to be done to address the timing issue.  
Fungibility is not something that cannot be treated casually.  It needs to exist without specialized requirements or extra work to accomplish.  If anything a slightly higher fee would be acceptable, but for bitcoin to succeed, it absolutely has to integrate features which provide anonymity, and not just "if you want it."  It needs to do so by nature.  Bitcoin should implement SNARKS once the tech is put into the wild and given a thorough testing over several years via zerocash.  It should become a bitcoin core feature.

Nobody deserves to have something stolen.  But I get what you are saying.

"having a stake in something doesn't automatically keep you from reducing the value of that stake if you can simply convert your stake into another asset"
Explain how this would work... Say you own 52% of the coin which cost you millions or billions of dollars to purchase.  Then say you attack that coin to give yourself more coin... At the point of attack, the value of all the coin goes down... Then you try to sell your coin for other stuff?  That doesn't work because you just destroyed the coin and now you are going to try to unload a chunk equal to half the total market?  Who is buying?... No one.  This scenario is not plausible.
"mitigate the hashing attack in some other way by cutting the PoW attacker out of the network, or in the worst case, switching the hashing algorithm and making their hardware investment completely worthless, without actually screwing with everyone's money"
"or you have to change the stake algorithm that cuts them, and their money, out of the system, which I'm not sure is possible if all the coins are supposed to be fungible."
---Those are the same problem which you just proposed the same solution to, and in both cases the solution you proposed would destroy the currency.  Being fungibile is absolutely critical to the success of any coin.
Lastly, your theory is completely off the wall.  I have never seen anything that indicates bitcoin hardware had anything to do with intels advance through its die sizes.  They are marching to 20 nm rapidly and it has nothing to do with bitcoin hardware.  In fact, BTC hardware is behind the ball, not pushing the bubble.

@_date: 2015-01-22 20:56:42
Coinshuffle doesn't address value distortion well enough yet.  Observers can still follow time stamps and generally follow the path of coins because inputs and outputs will be within a defined time frame and percentage of input value.  Blockchain detectives will be able to follow paths unless a bitmixer style automated delay system is integrated, and even then, the fact that you can still see details of the transactions means that someone with a knowledge of how these systems work could make associations based on outputs being within a percentage of inputs.  
Zerocash on the other hand should obscure virtually all transaction details from the get go.

This further reduces the necessity to hold bitcoin for the majority of people and creates incentives for fractional reserve style sends and receives.  Why would whole bitcoins need to be sent when they can be used as tokens to represent any denomination desired.  
The only opposing force to this is the necessity of computer power being given incentive to support the bitcoin network.  If coinbase and the like removes incentive for miners to exist, the network they are abusing will stop supporting them.

As a Purse user also, Purse seriously needs to do a few things that haven't been corrected though for a bitcoin seller.  
The biggest problem I see is that people can cancel orders with impunity.  That means that people who want to use stolen credit cards can try a card out and if Amazon cancels the order, the bitcoin buyer can simply cancel the purse order and then instantly rebuy it with no penalization from purse.  
There are several things purse can do to make this more seamless for the bitcoin seller.  
Purse needs to put a time hold on accounts that have cancelled orders.  This would stop people who are testing stolen cards from being able to re-buy the same order again.  If the hold was for a long enough time frame, it would deter people from cancelling orders and rebuying.  
In conjunction with the account holds, purse needs to keep track of IP addresses to the best of their abilities, and at least make a valid attempt at creating a system that actively makes it difficult for scammers to constantly create new accounts.  Of course, TOR would prevent this, but this is where the next suggestion would come in to play.
REPUTATION SYSTEM;  Finally and most importantly, there should be a buyer queue which allows the bitcoin seller to choose which buyer he will use within a certain time frame.  This will allow the bitcoin seller to decide which user to allow to buy his bitcoins based on reputation.  That way if a scammer is constantly generating new accounts, a bitcoin seller would at least have the option of declining to accept buys from users with little or no reputation.  A functional reputation system should be the main priority of this website so that it can remain anonymous while providing some assurance to bitcoin sellers.

Sorry about that, but that is weird because I have had the exact opposite experience.  About 2 months ago, I accidentally installed the S3 firmware on an S3+ and bricked it.  I emailed bitmain and they told me to ship them the controller and email them the tracking number.  I shipped it to them, emailed the tracking number, and the same day I saw my package arrive at their RMA center, I had a package at my door with the new controller and some nice swag.  That means that they shipped the package to me before they even received my RMA'd item.  Also, they didn't even charge me for the controller even though it was clearly my fault.  
I will say this... never had a machine ROI yet though :-( --- but that isn't bitmains fault, it is mine.  Both their communication and customer service has been great from day 1 for me.  Their cost to return on their products is another thing entirely.

Anything below the lowest cost of mining is a sign that something is very wrong. In my estimation the big Chinease guys can get down to $150 a coin.  Below that would shock me.  Also, if you factor in the upcoming halving, it would be logical for the market to vary between $150 a coin and $300 while stabilizing above $300 after the halving. In the process, there will be a series of market movements that find those prices, or even higher because the demand begins to outstrip the supply.

If the paper money deposits exceed the withdrawals, a human will need to pick the money up and deposit in a bank, then transfer it to coinbase.  Cash deposits can instantly be sent via ACH, but this process could take 3 or 4 days.  So, I would suggest that your coinbase dollar float account be able to handle 2, 3, or 4 weeks of typical volume on your machine.  Once a week, pick up cash and make a bank run.

The problem with the concept of banks adopting bitcoin is the same as the reality that faces bitcoin on a larger scale.  If the technology is too complex for the average individual to successfully secure his own coins with some kind of serious insurance while still giving them direct control over the actual BTC, we will never see mass adoption of the actual coin.
We may see some kind of mass adoption on the back end with banks pushing out some kind of fractional reserve version of BTC, but that won't mean anything for price.
And technically BTC makes it excessively easy to act as a fractional reserve system because you can color coins to represent more value than they actually have, while still using the blockchain for security.  Then each satoshi could become instantly more valuable and the scarcity that is what price is dependent upon would disappear.  
Adoption can occur in mass and BTC price still not rise depending on how directly the adoption occurs.

How?  This is absolutely true.  The bulk of 3600 coins are flooding the market every day from mining, and a huge amount of coin is converted to fiat by bitpay and coinbase every day.  Miners have little incentive to keep coin after a year of losses and an average cost per bitcoin of over $200 in power.  We are still over a year away from the halving also.
How does coinbase's situation change these fundamentals?  Are you suggesting that wall street is going to suddenly enter the picture with sustained and long term demand?  I hope you are right, but I don't see that being the case just because of some regulation and venture capital entering the picture.

Not a problem.  Just keep a float account on coinbase in its U.S. dollar storage system.  With current coinbase API's, you could automate the entire process so that the dollar float would cover every bitcoin the machine has, and instantly deposit the new bitcoin into the BTM as they are rebought. The machine could service itself with only the costs of coinbase fee's as friction.  You would just add 2% or whatever onto the total cost from coinbase, and then sit back and have a beer while your machine runs itself.  The only problem would be if people were withdrawing more cash than is being put in, since you would have to restock the machine by hand.  Of course whenever coinbase begins offering debit cards, you could just print out a debit card instead of or in addition to cash withdrawals.

They are eliminating customers by their friction causing fees.  I would have already spent a least a couple hundred there, but instead went through a friend and used coinbase.

How does this help anyone? If 25 people input 1 bitcoin, and 25 bitcoin come out the other end, someone doing bchain analyisis will see 25 bitcoin move in transactions at the same moment they came in.  They will know which people put those coins in, and they don't really care about which ones are specific to you.  They will still know that one of those 25 are connected to you, and they will track those coins until they are spent.  
Unless these things are mixing hundreds or even thousands of coins, I can't see how that would be effective.  
I believe that a user defined time delay should be implemented along with the ability to break outputs up into user defined portions among many different wallets while assuring that no coin that you receive is your own coin.  
Also, where did anyone say anything about coinshuffle implementations will all use like size outputs?  From my understanding, coinshuffle is about shielding the inputs from other users, not about sizes of coins shuffled.

I have accidentally done this before by having too little money in my account for the ACH to go through.  My bank charged me 64 dollars in fees, and coinbase simply cancelled the transaction.  I don't know what would happen if you tried to use the bank as a buffer for these types of drops in a repeated fashion, but I agree that it is a bit immoral since you entered into the deal with coinbase. 
I have eaten coins at 1100 plus even seeing massive drops after, and knowing I could likely pull out.  It the right thing to do to pay them because you made the choice and by not following through, you are effectively burning coinbase.  Being a capitalist means honoring deals even if they bite you in the butt.

Bash, block size is scarce because your team is doing everything you can to make is scarce and to scare people into believing that it has to be scarce.  There are no "physical limits." There are limits that naturally exist due to the free market being composed of people who are smart enough and adult enough to make their own boundaries based on market decisions.  And there are limits that people who think they are more important than other people are imposing on the rest of us.  Those are the only limits that exist, and it is pretty easy to see which of these fit the original ideals that bitcoin grew from.

He and all the other assholes who sit there and preach behind the supposed curtain of "in the right for highly technical reasons," while refusing to give those reasons to the public are idiots.  Maybe not because they are wrong, but because they assume that this incredibly technically adept and intelligent group of people who are interested in bitcoin can't understand them.  I don't care if they create bittorrent or made god in the machine, they have failed the community and themselves with their arrogance. 
If what they are saying is correct technically, then write up why and how and give it to the public right here on reddit or on your blog or wherever.  Don't treat us like children.  Many of us are CS professionals or students and are quite capable of understanding complex issues. 
There has been an absolute failure to communicate technical issues by people like this guy, and if they really have science and data backing them up, then they hold significant responsibility for not distributing that data to the public and for the recent repercussions that has had.  Spouting "in the right for highly technical reasons," while not giving a single one doesn't mean shit regardless of who you are.

The government should not have the ability to take every dime I have leaving me with nothing to pay basic life necessities.  The interests on these debts are crippling, and the charges leave you with an inability to get any decent job.  That means that the interest on the debts I owe is increasing more than the amount they are taking from me every month. And they are leaving me with nothing to pay bills with, and certainly no way to store any capital in a way that would let me catch up or God forbid get ahead so I can actually pay them back.

What?  Finance has nothing to do with having a very well vetted platform in the digital world.  Security needs to be proven over time by showing logical methods for securing both customers hot and cold coins.  
Coinbase has a track record for one of the most secure cold storage systems out there, and they are glad to talk (at least in limited detail) about it because it is so well done.  
Circle is one year old, which is like a baby in the security world, and they have proven nothing and don't really go into any specifics of how their security works. 
In addition, they don't offer a multi-sig solution like coinbase.  That means that if someone at the company absconds with your coin, you are out of luck.  In my opinion, offering a solution to hold your own coin via multi-sig wallet should be a basic requirement for any company that wants any kind of recognition in the BTC online wallet field. 
Circle is anything but vetted.

Clearly, the only velocity we should be talking about is into and out of the bitcoin blockchain.  Payment channels will serve as many things to many people, maybe storage, maybe even as a distributed processor.  This may mean massive amounts of off chain transactions that result in a net movement on the main chain of 0, which has no impact on velocity.
People seriously advocating lightening need to realize that the security and value of the real chain better be able to support the value in all of the channels combined.  This only way this can realistically happen is if the main chain grows massively so that side / sub / channels will be a proportion of the value of the main chain that is somehow balanced by real world economic factors... you know free markets. Let it grow.

Nobody has ever said that larger blocks don't increase resource requirements.  In fact that is an important aspect of systems like bitcoin unlimited.  The natural resource restriction is one of the factors that keep blocks sizes low because orphan risks increase rapidly if you attempt to publish blocks larger than the majority of the network can handle.
The point is that these restrictions happen naturally rather than through some artificially controlled human directive.

Bruce, I think you are being the voice of reason here.  My solution was for people to go to the convention and present their arguments directly to the people involved.  Instead, I have yet to see any hard documented evidence that would stand in court, and I have seen all kinds of accusations.  There is obviously a lot of seemingly damning things being thrown around, but this is not an example of one.  97% pre-mine would indicate centralization, but that does not absolutely mean scam.  False promises based on completely unrealistic and obviously unachievable goals is another thing, but I'd love to see these things laid out in an organized fashion that actually proves intentional wrong doing rather than just screams of scam.   
Nothing I have seen would stand in court including this hard evidence of pre-mining.  Just because the concept is stupid doesn't in and of itself prove its a scam.

What you are talking about is essentially fractional reserve transactions that operate using small amounts of bitcoin for smart contracts while using the bitcoin network for secure transactions.  
The biggest problem with this is that the miners cannot secure the network if the value of the token itself isn't high enough to make it worth people's time to mine.  
The incentive to attack the network will grow disproportionally to the network strength if the tokens themselves are worth less than the value they carry.
IE: Fractional reserve or smart contracts could break network security by throwing network strength out of balance with incentive to attack the network.

I've said this several times before.  Calling something brigading is a joke when you are talking about it coming from /btc.  Everyone at r/btc is either a current member or was a current member of /bitcoin.  If a group of small reach posts with 45 upvotes is enough to sway public opinion among people who *are already a part of your community*, then the problem isn't with the way the people doing this are organizing, it is with your premise.  
If you wanna start arguing the semantics of block size policies, then why don't we start from the beginning. Block size limits aren't the same thing as block size. Soft limits have worked perfectly well, and would continue to do so regardless of limit size. Why would they stop working under larger block limits? And yes, I know all the hypothetical arguments regarding centralization, and potential giant block attacks, but there are great counter-arguments regarding centralization, and there is no evidence to support the premises behind these supposed doomsday large impossible to propagate block attacks.  In fact there are great arguments showing how lack of growth will lead to centralization even more dramatic than a limited block size could.
Next is then the more important debate regarding the concept of direction being a "settlement network" vs a "payment network."  No, I won't have this argument. Bitcoin was always a payment network, and if it wants to be a settlement network, then it should add this capability rather than trade one for the other.  The only reason this debate comes around anyway is because the technical reasons that bitcoin can't grow aren't nearly enough to convince intelligent people.  And no, pointing to some of Gaven's 2 year old flawed proposals doesn't count when you start considering modern tech like bitpay's dynamic blocksize, bitcoin_unlimited's scheme, or even a simple one time fork to 2MB. All of these things have been shown to be safe, and there are more. So again, who decided to make our experiment change into a settlement network because the technical realities were that we can't grow? I can tell you it wasn't Gavin, and it wasn't the rest of the community. 
So then, how did we come to this point? Obviously it is because of lots of different things but one thing that is clear is that there is a dramatic growth in division. When certain groups of people said blocks couldn't grow, and other groups said they could... both were proven wrong in their initial assumptions.  Gaven's proposals were shown to be wrong, and small blocker's concerns were shown to have ways around them.  That is the point when we should have cast ego's aside and started really looking hard at the growth proposals.  But that didn't happen.  Heavy handed moderation kicked in, and caused people to be bitter and even more resolute in their opinions and ego.  
So sure you can claim that moderation was a small part of this, but that doesn't work for me.  I have been here the whole time, commenting, watching, learning, and feeling.  And in all of this, the feeling that moderation served to foment the division is one of the things that is a definite.  You can try to logic it away, but I've lived in it and I know.

There are ways to do both.  Zero knowledge proofs are the way forward, but that doesn't mean ditching bitcoin completely before something else that is well vetted comes forward.  There are several possibilities that could fill this roll, but fungibility is one of the key elements.  Coders need to be careful though because if the value on the blockchain isn't readily visible then it is essentially disconnected from the forces that drive security.

This is a great article. The issue of an imbalance between value on the chain due to colored coins and other value that is not directly related to the token value vs value spent to secure the network is extremely important.

Your entire statement here is predicated on the fact that they didn't get support, but that has no bearing on whether something fits the definition of "contentious" at its birth, which is exactly what happened here at r/bitcoin and other prominent forums.  Labeling something as "contentious" and then eliminating discussion about it before it begins is dangerous to bitcoin.
I suggest that you stop using that word in reference to anything that is being discussed in the present tense.  Reserve it for past tense... I.E. classic failed because it could not gain consensus, as in there was too much contention surrounding it to gain consensus.

@_date: 2016-01-11 02:53:33
That is not true.  We have constantly seen an increase in hashpower without the block size cap or fee subsidies ever coming into play so far, and there is no reason to believe anything should ever be different until the block reward is essentially meaningless.  If the network continues to grow and the value of bitcoin grows along with it, that could be many many decades.

You act as though L2 is something that people agree with to begin with. It isn't, and the fact that a group of people in charge and a few people running the main info channels want it won't change that. 
Bitcoin L1 can succeed for far larger volume than it is now, and at least to the point where it actually has a real technical reason, it should be allowed to. There is no question that the decisions being made right now are going to inhibit growth in an extremely important phase for bitcoin, and not for any real technical reason, and as far as I'm concerned that is stupidity without cause that is going to effect my investment.  
Again stop with the black and white, "the sooner it happens" crap.  L1 can carry this through many many times its current volume without issue, and the hardliners who won't budge on this issue are doing nothing more than destroying growth before a halving because they can't see past their own egos.

“Contentious” is a false label to attribute to something that is new and has not been vetted by all parties who have stake in the system.  This is because the word “contentious" implies disagreement.  Logically, this is not possible before code has been released unless you are willing to acknowledge that politics or alternative motives are potential causes for “contentiousness” to occur.
And if this is the case, then you are acknowledging the logical conclusion of the “contentious” argument, which is that opinion, which can easily be manipulated by things like coordinated censorship of websites like this, can control whether something is considered acceptable before code even exists. 
If this is true, then bitcoin really isn't as strong as it should be.

If I hand you a paper wallet, or give it to my kid, how would the government ever prove you did not own that paper wallet from day 1?  Also, how could the government possibly tax this type of exchange?  There is no public record of exchange and there is no way for the government to take the bitcoins from the wallet without you both volunteering to tell them you received the paper wallet and then subsequently volunteering to send them a percentage of those BTC.  
I think this subject could get much deeper when you include trusts and other forms of wealth protection that are transferable.  Certainly, if the U.S. was going to implement laws that took percentages of bitcoins upon death, someone could just leave the states and then go somewhere that doesn't have death taxes.  
It is going to be an interesting world because BTC isn't going away and the methods that the government has to confiscate wealth are far more limited in the case of BTC than wealth stored in banks or other traditional legal asset storage methods.  From the perspective of someone who believes in equal opportunity but not equal results, it also introduces some interesting philosophical questions since it is just as difficult to control as cash but it is way more easily transferable in significant quantities.

Any changes that make substantial differences to the way bitcoin is used should be given the same consideration as any others.

Growth in represented transaction value per Sat will not happen without major on boarding of new capital.  That requires that either the current users massively increase their investment or new users enter the picture.  It's a very simple equation, and since user base growth has so many positive side effects for decentralization, it is the logical solution.  
Decisions that attract new users should be prioritized right now, and the best way to do that is to allow block sizes to grow while introducing solutions like segwit when it is ready, and in the way it is designed... as a hard fork. 
@_date: 2016-03-26 23:40:33
I know it is hard for people in the r/bitcoin sphere to come to grips with this since this is an echo chamber, but the hard fork isn't "contentious" if it succeeds, and if it doesn't succeed, it isn't a hard fork.  Labeling it as that is not accurate in any circumstances.

The reason purse is so successful is they actually let the savings amount float.  They created an open market.  So you aren't stuck at 5% if you don't want to set it at 5%.  I typically see 20% or more when I buy, and that is reasonable considering it is a worldwide way to buy bitcoins with gift cards.  There is a large multi billion dollar market for those gift cards.  So unless your service can perform the functions of a market that can float the discount just like purse, then you will not compete.  Look at what happened to their previous competitors.

I'm guessing you haven't tried many of the current generation variants such as gnome or mint cinnamon?  These OS's are super stable, and are only missing a few things to be perfect.  If last year was supposed to be the year of desktop linux, I'd say they just barely failed.  However, my wife is using linux now without trouble (although I maintain it), which really is saying something since she is completely technically illiterate.  
If the distros work out the few remaining kinks (which they will since that is what they do), linux will blow up, because at that point I'd feel better about handing a linux box to my grandfather than mac or windows machine.  And while a lowly tech guy like myself is relatively meaningless, if I'm thinking about it, then it means others are thinking about it.  I'm sick and tired of having to clean peoples computers of viruses and junk, and nobody really wants to pay for a mac, so at this point if linux works flawlessly for all use cases of the old people I have in my life, you bet I will install it for them, and it won't just be me doing this either.

He basically shows that the entire network can handle the 101 path right now except china at specific times.  He says that at some times, china is fast enough, but other times it isn't.  However, he goes on and proposes some solutions which seemed pretty logical and easy to implement to me, and they would be done on the side of the Chinese people wanting to run nodes and miners which means that they wouldn't be a code requirement on core.  
In addition, his test was set to handle FULL 8 mb blocks several years ago.  And this isn't logical.  I keep saying this, but no one seems to pay attention.  The block cap is not the same as the block size.  Several papers have come out which show that block size will trend to the lowest average possible size due to orphan risk (among other things) increasing proportionally to block size. This is why systems like unlimited work in reality compared to testnet tests which actually use the maximum available capacity.  In the real world no-one would actually use maximum capacity since the orphan risk would be so high that no-one would risk it.

Bitcoin devs should not be developing bitcoin outside of the the core of what is bitcoin.  They should only be focused on providing interfaces to the chain and making the chain itself better.  Their job is not off chain, that is for the market. 
Most people who support BU aren't supporting BU so much as on chain scaling that moves with technology.

I've been here for months and read almost every main article.  I have followed the bickering between the core devs.  They have never released significant data backing their claims that bigger blocks increase centralization.  Since this claim is the main reason for almost every subsequent action they have taken, and more importantly for their inaction on the issue of scaling, it seems there should be hard... and I mean hard as in the result of tests... data.  
But they don't have or haven't release this kind of data.  On the other hand, several of the opposing developers have actually released data from testing which backs their claims.  
You can say that it has been buried and I just missed it, but that would be unlikely since for several months, the CSS has been manipulated and moderation policies have been implemented to shut threads opposing core ideas down, to promote comments in core's favor to prominent positions, and to make threads un-collapsible.  By doing that, they made it such that comments they wanted people to see did not follow your user defined collapse settings, which means that you see every comment regardless of downvotes.
Yet through all this, I still haven't seen data backing their big blocks = centralization hypothesis.

This is a circular argument.  How can we determine what the economy supports if we can't discuss it.  And calling it "because of alt-whatever" is entirely arbitrary as far as I'm concerned.  You call whatever you don't like an alt-coin with no distinctions other than your opinions.  
By the definition you use mostly, bitcoin in its present state is already an Alt-coin... or at least it was temporarily until consensus formed around it.  And this has happened several times in BTC's history.  So ask yourself why that happened?  Why did we have a temporary alt-coin according to your definition, but yet it ended up as bitcoin?  It is a pretty simple answer but it should be creating cognitive dissonance in you.  
It was never an alt-coin, and any possible changes to the system that last are not alt-coins as long as they follow the proof of work rules that guide the system.  
Forks are part of the very heart, soul, and blood of bitcoin.  Discussion is the spark for that life blood.  And you seek to squash it because you are scared of what could happen should it not be aligned with what your personal vision is.

The only people who would fall victim to your imagined attack are the non-existent people who are running bitcoin on their 56k modems in the middle of Uganda.

A lot of people focused on 101 because it was motion in what we saw as one of the most important issues in the bitcoin scope when nothing else was happening.  It may be easy to find criticism for 101 now that there are a plethora of options, but remember that those options would not have existed at all if 101 and the movement it created didn't instigate the volume of action that is now being taken. 
Also, I don't agree with your characterization that 101 predicts where the network is going to be.  It simply sets a cap along the very well understood and long established bounds of Moore's law.  If the network usage hasn't caught up to Moore's law, the soft caps will work just as well as they have been... which is great. 
If the network catches up to, or surpasses Moore's law, then centralization will occur anyway because only the few that are on the cutting edge will be able to participate in the network.

Also, as I have said, I have never seen once any real research behind the premise that larger blocks bring centralization. I have seen real research in the opposite vein however. This makes roadmaps like what the core team have established somewhat questionable when there is a solution that has been tested extensively waiting for us."

I'm not making noise about nothing.  Segwit is an enormous piece of code that requires extensive testing, not just for bugs and coding issues, but for impact analysis.  It has been through a lot of scrutiny and most of us expect it to be a good thing for the network, but certainly is not ready now.  You are right this turned out to be an issue that was upgraded away, but this is part of the process that needs to happen before the code can be merged.  And it doesn't need a little more of this, it needs a lot more testing until it is forced to break in the most unusual ways it can.

I think the things you are asking would be the equivalent to the core team coming out and condemning the systemic censorship of main channels of information and then making a statement that they were wrong about pursuing the path they have and should have agreed to a small block size increase while pursuing a long term solution like the bitpay idea.

The block reward subsidy is plenty for miners for many years to come.  I'd say 20 years is when we need to start having serious fee systems come into play, and this is assuming block sizes don't expand massively so they can accomadate enough transactions so that fees become almost 0, but miners still make more.  This is what should be happening as opposed to artificially restricting growth and forcing current users to pay more. 
@_date: 2016-01-10 17:55:52
The coinbase reward will sustain mining operations for decades more.  You are not wrong, but my perspective is that user growth and total transaction growth should be our focus rather than increasing fees through block size pressure in any near future. 
@_date: 2017-03-23 15:29:43
BU isn't blocking segwit.  BU is bitcoin members who want on chain scaling.  Bitcoin members are blocking segwit because it is not a compromise in any way with a significant chunk of the community.

Nobody said it needs to compete with visa right now.  Why is it always so black and white for people who share your views?  Security comes from decentralization of more things than just nodal structure. It can also come from decentralization of user base, coder base, and use cases being broad. All of these things are technologically possible in bitcoin, yet for some reason small blockers incessantly grab onto to this nodal centralization concept and blow off about it being all important, even though there is exactly no evidence to show that increasing block size would do a single thing relating to centralization of nodes.
Then in the other corner of the small blockers, there is the more pragmatic who have simply stopped spraying the "decentralize at all costs" theme because it doesn't work, and have instead just outright said they want to artificially create a fee market.  
The reality is that the only black and white of this situation is that the only real argument small blockers have is relating to fee markets needing to develop.  They just don't mention the fact that even a miner in an average costing power U.S. town can still make significant profit on mining from the block reward alone.  Even post halving, this will be the case, even if the price doesn't go up.  Miners are making plenty.  That is why the hash rate is rising so rapidly, so this argument is only something that works in 10 to 20 years from now, and again only if you limit the user base to the point where we need high enough fees than an individual would feel them.

Gimmy a break.  1000X current transactions could be instantly handled without a hichup.  I see a critical junction coming now with a halving approaching and the only thing keeping the network from being able to handle it is people's ego.  Of course my dollar value is going to take a hit, but who cares.  I hold bitcoin.  I don't spend it, so I don't care about current balance.  I care about being able to grow when we need to.  Currently, we can't do that.
@_date: 2016-03-03 14:17:59
It is, but my point was about velocity.  Whatever number of bitcoins is locked in a channel could be spent off chain as many times as someone wanted before some settlement on chain occurred.  For example, someone could lock one bitcoin in a payment channel, and use it to start an entire fiat currency that they rarely or never actually settle on chain.  There could be an entire economy on that one bitcoin that is entirely off chain.  At that point, not only do the security risks apply to the people using that coin as fiat, but the value that single coin represents could far outweigh the actual value of the single coin.  This could cause a major security threat to the main chain because the value represented in all sub chains combined could be orders of magnitude greater than what is represented in the main chain.  This gives a major incentive to attack the network because the value on chain is proportional to the mining reward and thus the amount of miners, so the amount of mining power would remain far lower than the actual value it was protecting.

You can claim differences between Moore's original statement and reality and that is certainly valid.  However, the trend for OVER 5 decades now has been nearly perfectly linear in nature.  It has been said to be hitting a limit over and over again, and every time it is shown to be wrong.  
For example, the limits that we were are supposed to be approaching based on hitting a size limit in the nano scale have once again been broken with 3d technologies... 
Expect the linear trend to continue.  And that is what 101 was supposed to follow.  
@_date: 2017-03-30 09:02:45
People asked for a long term solution, not an single constant increase.  Segwit is like C * O(n) / b . It permanently reduces all on chain transaction costs by some constant factor.  It does nothing to solve the brick wall problem that is the block size, and it is a giant muddy bog when it comes to code clarity on an already festering code base.  
We need long term on chain solutions that also make the codebase more simple.
There are only 2 flavors...
Reduce the cost (in bytes) per transaction or increase the capacity. 
Both should be happening.

You can't throw the baby out with the bathwater though.  The forks we are seeing now have merit, either by actually being real solutions, or by being catalysts to real solutions.  These are clearly different than malicious versions that as you astutely pointed out are entirely possible.  I'm not sure what the litmus test should be to establish the difference between what we are seeing now and actual malicious scams, but that should also be discussed at large. Seems like this post is the first of this type of discussion which I find refreshing. 
Regardless of the results of those discussions, any reasonable person should long ago have seen the need to have open discussion relating to the recent BIPs and forks that have popped up.  These are clearly the most important issue facing bitcoin right now and are so far pretty clearly not malicious.  Afterwards, hopefully that level of attention is given to privacy.  But right now, what the community needs is open discussion here, in one of the top information streams related to BTC out there.  There are great minds here which are being turned off by the aggressive "moderation."

Segwit is substantially more challenging than a simple block size increase and the few lines of code required to keep spam from occurring... maybe 5 lines of code.  Segwit is currently over 500 lines of code and requires substantial change in consensus methodology as well as other core things.  
Segwit means a major shift for the entire industry.  It means all wallet software would have to be updated, and even hardware wallets would have to be redesigned in some cases since segwit actually creates a new type of address.  Segwit is great, but it is far more than just a nice easy transition go between.  Larger blocks should be the easy solution that sets us up for it.

Gavin isn't the forefront of this movements direction.  He showed that it could happen and then it has cascaded.  
And, I don't dispute anything you have said here.  But the problem I see with your argument is that it is predicated on the idea that block sizes will suddenly rise if block caps rise.  This has shown to be wrong by research through the bitcoin unlimited team as well as Peter R.

More adoption means higher prices which means more profit for miners.  Their marginal cost is literally 0 so an increase in value directly translates to more profits.  This is basic economics.  Obviously more available profits means more competition.
Businesses who accept bitcoin again obviously means more nodes because those businesses will need clearing checks for transactions.  Just as VISA has to call home to clear your transaction at the checkout, this will be necessary for a bitcoin transaction at a register.  This doesn't just means more nodes are likely, it actually means more nodes are necessary for mass commerce to be possible.
If businesses all over accept bitcoin, those businesses will have demand for services that reduce their likelihood of loosing money from bitcoin transactions.  This means a massive influx of development money, businesses, and infrastructure to support these market demands.  
The only thing that is unclear in my argument is stability, but stability logically follows a massive increase in network infrastructure and velocity of bitcoin flow.  Velocity means stability in the bitcoin world.

Zerocoin development itself hasn't been peer reviewed, but the math behind it has seen significant advancements and important publications surrounding it.  This wasn't an effort to make a new crypto coin.  The researchers realized early on that the best method to handle this kind of problem was to modularize the necessary math and create a framework to coordinate separate teams so that researchers could pick and choose what they wanted to work on.  This method allowed for larger involvement from the academic community than would be typical and also created natural redundancies since in some cases, multiple teams worked on the same math from completely different approaches. 
This has resulted in a great deal of usable new math that can be pieced together by the zcash team or whatever other team can wrap their heads around the research to create a new generation of truly fungible crypto currencies.  Regardless of what happens with Zcash, it should be noted that the achievements zksnarks bring, as well as the surrounding math that was and is still being produced because of this project, will be forever significant in the crypto-currency world.

@_date: 2018-10-27 22:07:12
I have already spelled this out multiple times.  It is really quite simple and you could think of these yourselves in seconds instead of downvoting me for no reason...
SOME Factors which could be used (there are more). 
1. Amount in transaction (no one is going to spend the money to double spend a $5 purchase with any high likelihood).  As $ value in transaction goes up, this factor will decrease likelihood that a transaction can be considered safe. 
2. Immediate delivery vs delayed delivery.  In person transactions need to be more immediate so there are different risk factors.  A business could customize this factor based on experience. 
3.  Is there a double spend attempt out in the network currently?  Obviously, this would massively increase the risk if detected.  Double spends can't just happen out of no where.  If the double spender wants any significant chance of his double spend going through, he won't rely on a single miner, and the likelihood of a miner with a significant hash power behind him accepting bribes to guarantee the double spend actually happening (if that particular miner happens to mine the block) is pretty low.
4.  Time since transaction broadcast without double spend detected.  Ties to the previous, but a longer time increases the confidence that the transaction is valid.  Small amounts of time could be significant here. 
5.  Credit records / human factors.  If this is a high dollar transaction (like for a car) and there is paperwork involved, a persons credit as well as other ratings could easily be factored in. 
6.  Network / mining factors.  The hash power distribution among miners is a factor.  If there is a high concentration of hash power in the hands of known bad actors, the overall probability of a double spend may increase. 
7. ...your factors.  Be creative make your own stuff up that you think matters.
Given just these, we could easily define a simple function which outputs a confidence level.  In fact, before RBF, these types of confidence levels were offered as services that businesses could incorporate into their payment services.  Those services behaved similarly to how a credit card company has a quick checkup for every transaction.  This worked and works great excluding RBF transactions.

... it *can* cost them nothing, but it is a choice they have to make.  Forming the data bundle and hashing on it takes some small amount of time and energy.  If they form the data bundle from the original transaction, it does *cost* them time and energy to reform a new data bundle.  And yeah I know they can form those bundles on other cores while hashing, but it is still a *cost*. 
Network and miner behavior are just factors that are part of confidence level function.  
But what is your point?... I was specifically responding to the guy who said someone was going to bribe miners telling him that it wouldn't happen.

On chain scaling refers to increasing the capacity of the blockchain to handle more transactions directly rather than through channels or other alternatives.  On chain scaling includes solutions like segwit or other packaging methods that can hold more transactions per KB of block size, as well as expanding block size directly to hold more total data.  Bitcoin is decentralized by nature whereas off chain payment channels or other solutions are certainly not and are susceptible to government or other third party control.

But the problem exists when almost everyone is using AML / KYC systems, which is entirely plausible since it would be extremely easy to do if bitcoin use was truly ubiquitous.  Governments would simply impose laws that require ALL businesses transacting in bitcoin to be registered.  They would make treaties with other countries to do the same. 
Working around the system can only be realistic if there are significant use cases for bitcoin outside of the AML/KYC network.  But bitcoin provides a means for KYC/ AML to exist everywhere rather than only in banks / exchanges like it is now.  Certainly governments will exploit this weakness given a scenario where bitcoin is everywhere.
And in the cases that governments create a nearly complete worldwide web of AML / KYC style nonsense, then there really won't be many ways to get your bitcoin in and out these systems without being noticed so I don't see many use cases for people who want privacy.

No one is going to sell double spends for $1 when it costs a miner more than that to do a block reorg.  
Additionally, you seem to be missing the whole point here.  We are talking about probabilities and defining a "confidence" level function.  If you are doing a transaction online, then that will obviously factor into the function differently than an in person transaction.  And obviously, if you do higher dollar value transactions, your confidence level is lower, so you wait for confirmations.
This isn't rocket science.

You don't get to decide what is and isn't worth it.  That is the point of a free market.  Bitcoin was contrived to be a free market system from the ground up.  Allowing some arbitrary group of people to decide what is and isn't acceptable within this system is certainly not in order with the spirit or design of bitcoin.  You have aligned yourself with the camp that believes their own perspective is better than market forces.  Personally I believe that this is both arrogant and wrong.

You can't call physics arbitrary.  These things cannot be changed.
And you can't call bitcoin's limit "arbitrary."  It was certainly put in place for valid reasons, but it was intended from the moment of its inception to be increased for valid reasons that remain valid today.  The decision to not increase from that number is the main "arbitrary" argument I have seen since there is very little evidence that not increasing it is beneficial.  Although the decision to not increase it is certainly not arbitrary since people have carefully and calculatingly decided to not let it increase since they benefit from that behavior.

You really think specific ISP's are going to be able to limit bandwidth forever?  We are in a worldwide network that tends to route around dams.  Bitcoin as a system does the same.  We shouldn't fear human imposed restrictions, and we shouldn't develop based on those restrictions, especially when doing so means trusting specific humans to make decisions about what transactions are considered spam and which aren't.  Bitcoin is designed to be market driven and trust-less and there is no reason we should cast aside this trust-less state just because someone feels like in this moment technology will buck a long running trend like what Moore's law describes.

Your conspiracy stuff aside, you are describing the basics of how bitcoin works and is supposed to work.  It isn't a problem.  Any group of miners &gt;= 51% hash rate can maintain control over bitcoin if they work collaboratively.  It is how bitcoin has always worked and is how it is supposed to work.  The place you are going wrong is when you start suggesting that these people would want to sabotage bitcoin.  If they did this, they would need to be willing to sacrifice the hundreds of millions they have invested into their mining hardware. 
The problem you described isn't a problem once you realize that the largest group of same proof of work miners has the largest investment in their mining gear, and therefor the highest incentive for bitcoin's success.  They also carry along with them the name bitcoin despite the incessant counter narrative here in this sub.  Bitcoin is not some core project.  It always could be forked without issue, and there exists some possibility that the fork will become the consensus version of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 07:37:05
Core doesn't matter.  Proof of work does, and proof of work follows market driven economics.  Core can follow whatever they feel like at the time and it won't matter if they aren't acting on behalf of the market.  NYA was a consensus between majority controllers of hash power.  It was an agreement of where that power will land, and if the majority of it ends up landing on bitcoin cash, then bitcoin cash will become bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-10-27 20:44:22
As I said, a RBF transaction is 100% replaceable.  This is significantly different than "if a miner .... then he can &lt;choose&gt; to ..." which is a conditional.
What you are assuming in your argument is that the sender has control over a particular miner, and then in turn that that is the particular miner that will actually mine the block.  
Both of these things could be true, but that doesn't change the fact that they are a pair of conditionals, which any reasonable person would quickly realize carry probabilities that can be used to make decisions about accepting a payment live or not.   
In real world terms it works like this... I am a business and I am accepting a 5 dollar payment, so the *likelihood* (read probability) that this 5 dollar payment is connected to a miner who has a high *likelihood* (read probability) to mine a block that will *choose* (read probability) to include the double spend is extremely low.  So, I will accept the 5 dollar payment and the associated risk.  In a $50,000 payment, I will not choose to accept the risk.  But that is my choice as a business owner.  
This is basic stuff.  Not sure why you feel the need to resort to conspiracies and name calling about bitcoin cash.

Funny.  Lets all just believe this guy because of what he says rather than what he does.
@_date: 2018-10-28 23:36:44
I'm not talking about a chain reorg... I'm talking about internal propagation of block structure within a mining pool.
To mine a block, you take the data (a group of transactions and some other stuff) and you pack it into a data structure.  Then you hash on it.  If you want to hash on a new group of transactions, you must repack those transactions and distribute the necessary hashes throughout your mining network.  This costs time and energy.  
In the example you just described, you *could* consider the 70% a cap for confidence although that isn't realistic.  Other factors would both lower that confidence level or increase it depending on your confidence function.  I can easily think of several factors which could impact confidence positively more than even the known existence of bad pool in certain situations.  
For example if a person walks into a store in front of cameras and makes a $5 purchase, the likelihood they will steal from the store is extremely low, even if there is a %30 hash power pool which is a known bad actor (which there isn't).  Other factors that might trump the existence of such a pool are whether ID was presented or not, or credit history.  And there are more.  You just have to be creative and define what you think is important.  Additionally, time would absolutely play in, because sending a double spend to the *whole* network would reduce that cap compared to *possibly* sending it to one bad actor.  If a long time has existed since the original transaction has occurred without the *whole* network seeing a double spend, then yes, our cap changes.
The point of all this here is that you aren't acknowledging reality if you don't see that the confidence level function is entirely plausible in a non-RBF situation.  The second someone signs a RBF transaction, we are forced to ignore the confidence function entirely.   Details of how the confidence function is defined are not and have never been my argument.

Sorry it doesn't fly.  His company has nearly entirely been responsible for delaying the growth of bitcoin's user base as well as changing the mission of bitcoin from peer to peer transactions to settlement layer.  
There is simply no way that 2nd or third layers could come close to the decentralized nature of a raw block chain.  The fact that his company has spent so many resources on scaling while specifically avoiding simple on-chain techniques like Schnorr signatures and other block packing techniques clearly shows that they are not only not interested in keeping peer to peer transactions as a primary goal of bitcoin, but that they are willing to invest huge amounts of money in order to force bitcoin into layer 2 and 3 solutions so that they can then sell their centralized gatekeeper based sub networks.

@_date: 2018-10-28 18:49:41
Because for a large enough pool to have an impact to guarantee the correct transaction is included in their block and to do so in a timeline where you even have a chance at a double spend... you will need serious connections to significant miners, and those miners must be willing to either set up software to conduct your double spends automatically, or do a complete block reorg on your whim.  Both of these things cost a hell of a lot more than $5.  
Additionally, even if you do manage to get one pool on board your double spend plans, you still only have a chance of the double spend occurring that is equal to their percentage of hash power.  So if you want confidence that your double spend will happen, you should plan on doing the above actions with a significant number of pools.  You will not be able to do this for cheap.

Acknowledgement of the ledger is up to the users and merchants as you said, not the node operators.  Nodes can be spun up instantaneously for any flavor of bitcoin that exists.  But most users will follow the majority proof of work.  If this shifts to BCH because of core blocking 2X, the infrastructure won't be hard to bring to life for a nearly identical chain, and you will see merchant adoption come to life.  Hell purse has already started accepting them, and shapeshift works fine with it so merchants who accept current core chain can already accept BCC.

Bitcoin had absolutely no need for close to a 1mb size until 2015.  Miners just self regulated and soft limited block sizes without problems the whole time.

Bitcoin can be valuable for different reasons and can be accepted and used by different people in different ways.  There is value is a publicly accepted settlement layer just as there is value in a peer to peer cash system.  If the people using it for these different things see a need to have their own flavor of bitcoin, it is just fine with me.  I don't really care as long as there is something cheap enough to actually use to buy stuff from purse and send stuff to my buddies.  For me that means I will use whichever system offers the cheapest fees and has the easiest to use wallets.  I won't really sell anything anyway, but if other people see a need for two systems, it doesn't *hurt* bitcoin, it just expands the scope of the crypto currency world.

On-chain scaling is the way to scale.  Layers are wonderful, but core should be focused on properly scaling the main chain.  If they can't wrap their heads around larger block sizes, they should be pursuing Schnorr signatures and other block packing techniques before jumping to solutions like segwit which are primarily designed to enable higher layers.  These alt-layer-solutions are in no way as secure or decentralized as interacting directly through the blockchain and they simply never can be.  They reduce the peer-to-peer connectivity of bitcoin by nature.  Their pursuit of these scaling solutions despite the resistance was a major blunder by the core team.
Higher level solutions should prioritized well below on-chain scaling (although they should exist as competition) and this is why so much resentment has fomented against core.

There are different forms of centralization I have to talk about.  They are...
1. Centralization of the node base.
2. Centralization of ability to directly access the main chain.
Number 1 is what happens when the block size grows due to costs of bandwidth and storage increasingly removing people from the node pool.  
Number 2 is what happens when no growth in transactions per second occurs on the main chain while demand for chain access increases.  Notice I didn't say block size growth, I said growth in TPS.  This is important because growth in main chain access doesn't require block size increases, they just happen to be the easiest way to get a TPS bump.  There are alternative methods for on chain growth that have been widely discussed here like schnor signatures and other block packing techniques to pack more transactions per block.
The more direct answer to your question is not that BCH won't create an increased centralization of nodes.  In fact I expect it will.  The reason this is ok in my mind is that the alternative form of centralization (centralization of access to the main chain) is far worse.  I see the use of side chains and lightening nodes to be a far greater opportunity for centralized control points where governments and large corporations can control or even deny access.  Within those subnets, the peer to peer nature of bitcoin can be removed. 
I should also note that I find that node centralization is not significant.  Satoshi predicted it and discusses it.  There are ways to negate its significance.  One such example is that centralized nodes could act as servers for a hash chain.  Second class nodes could store block hash chains so that there is a cheap way to make sure no malarkey is going on, and anyone who wanted to could still run a full node.  
Another other idea which reduces centralization in node base is the concept that block growth should track moores law.  There were proposals in the wild for this.  It would essentially keep node count where it is or higher.
In the end, I don't see centralization of node count to be a problem while I do see centralization of peer to peer interactivity to be a problem.  And given the above mentality, core should have long been prioritising on chain scaling solutions if they want to preserve the economic principles of bitcoin.

Very unlikely this will turn out as you expect.  Segwit alone was unable to get much more than 30% support.  This is equivalent to what the big block variations were able to get.  If core dumps the 2X portion and stands on 1X, I think it is highly likely that a significant percentage of the people who voted for 2X would jump ship to BCH.  They weren't really on board for segwit, but signed the NYA as a compromise.  It is something core has been unwilling to do whatsoever, and it will likely bite them in the rear as the people who compromised are burned for a second time and completely bail on them.

You are probably correct about a good chunk of the people who post about it being noobs, but that isn't because other long time users aren't experiencing the same problem, it is just that we know it is pointless to bitch about it here.

Don't act like this is a black and white problem set where only some problems can exist.  Centralization, fungibility, and on chain scaling are ALL problems.  And while certain people have worked to paint on chain scaling as directly leading to centralization, it is not a fact.  There are also decentralization benefits that come from on chain scaling. 
I think that Gavin and others initially (several years ago) believed that scaling on chain was an issue that could be solved relatively quickly and then the community could move on to the other issues.  Instead, certain groups of people have spent enormous amounts of time working actively to stop on chain scaling rather than working together to find a solution and then move on to the other issues.

...having choices is a necessary condition of a free market.  Of course it isn't a bad thing.  Yet core has decided they are going to prioritize a growth pattern that forces users onto secondary layers while artificially and arbitrarily restricting access (removing the choice) to the main chain.  
You are suggesting that people who are forcing users into layer 2 solutions are somehow offering more choice than those who would do both?  Look at my history.  I have often suggested that bitcoin developers should be focusing on layer 1 growth while also focusing on providing access points for layer 2.  This is the only way the market can even have the ability to choose... both solutions must exist for their to be a choice.  But this simply isn't going to happen.  There is no possible way that the people who have been blocking the expansion of layer 1 will allow it in the future.  Mark my words, the 2x part of segwit2x will no go through... and if somehow it does, it will be only because core has seen the writing on the wall that forks are viable, and that they (bitcoin developers) are there to provide bitcoin (not layer 2) based solutions.

It may even be possible to fully spoof blocks in the main chain to appear valid to old clients while entirely changing the meaning of what the data they are transmitting is actually doing.  Or maybe I'm wrong.

Off chain transactions should be competing with on chain governed by Moore's law and soft limits.  Priority should be given to the on chain solutions you mentioned as long as they exist.  2nd layer solutions will never be as decentralized as layer 1.  Humans should never be in a position where they can arbitrarily decide what is acceptable or not for the network.  The only thing that should govern that is free markets.

Bitcoin is designed to be upgraded when situations like this arise.  Forks are specifically built for this kind of thing.  If the current bitcoin isn't resielient enough to withstand some other coin's influence, then it needs to be upgraded.  Bitcoin's primary upgraded mechanism is a fork, which for some reason has become taboo around here.

The people who created it, the people who use it, and the press calls it Bitcoin cash.  Bcash was a name started by people who have nothing to do with it "in order to distinguish it from bitcoin."  These people's intentions were to separate it from bitcoin and thus to make it look less important than it is.  Calling it anything other than Bitcoin Cash is both wrong and intentionally stirring up reactions.  That is what trolling is.

Coinbase has a "vault" system where your keys are entirely in your control.  They could get hacked or go out of business, and you would still control your coins.  
The hate for coinbase here in this sub mostly stems from the political position coinbase took against the restriction of block size by some of bitcoins software developers.  This sub is dominated by people who want that restriction to continue happening while a significant other group wants bitcoin's block size to grow.  Coinbase took the position that the block size should grow, and that angered some people.  
Regardless, Coinbase's vault system is awesome and they remain the best company to buy bitcoin from.  I would not listen to the people who badmouth them as they have an agenda.

No, difficulty decreases happen much faster than once ever several week period for BCC.  The initial period of reduced hash power was anticipated by devs and a secondary ability to drop difficulty was added.  As of now, the BCC chain is somewhere around 16% of the difficulty of the core chain. 
I'm not sure how long it will take to achieve 10 minute blocks but when that happens bitcoin cash will operate exactly like bitcoin except it will have larger block caps that are soft limited by miners (like bitcoin used to be).

It sounds like the block header is being used as a pointer to a side data structure.  I am fine with that, but this doesn't sound like it is actually making anything better.  Anyone who wants to do full validation will still have to store all the information.  The benefit of segwit sounds like it is the compression, but the location of the data doesn't seem particularly important to me aside from it allows the core team to keep their soft fork at all costs mentality rather than sticking the data in the main chain.  If this is true, it also convinces me they have been spouting non-sense the entire time in regards to centralization, because this will have no impact on it relative to larger blocks with a better compression scheme.

There is no doubt that ISP's are limiting your bandwidth.  But you are participating in a global system.  Your personal experience, no matter how harsh, should not be justification for framing an entire system.  And this is what has been happening.  A group of people who happen to have control of social media and commit access for the main repos has decided their personal beliefs on what transactions are spam or not should dictate to the entire network how it should grow.  They do this despite protest by a significant portion of participants disagreeing with them.
You can claim whatever you want about me hand-waving while you sit there and wave your hands wildly about "dangerous" hard forks.  It doesn't matter.  Just like networks will route around slow ISP's, Bitcoin will route around elements which cause friction.  Hard forks will happen because they are the natural upgrade mechanism within bitcoin.  Claims that you are "in reality"...don't matter.  The system will bypass anyone who gets in its way.

A hard fork does not imply that backwards compatibility is not maintained.  A hard fork could be implemented in the same fashion as a soft fork so that transactions from old wallets would just exist on both the old chain and the new.

Dude go read the post.  It wasn't as though people just started randomly all using bcash.
Here is an example ... in this [thread]( the use of bcash didn't happen until page 111 on August 02, 2017.  This is 12 days since the start of the thread and coincides with the announcements in which the moderators of r bitcoin specifically started relabeling the coin for the purpose of social engineering on August 1st after the successful fork.  In addition, there was an attempt to control subreddits with the bcash and bch labels in an attempt to falsely create the impression that the bitcoin cash community was housed there.  You can read about that happening [here](  This is no conspiracy, it is just what is happening.

It doesn't lead to increased centralization any more than 2nd layer solutions do.  
There are 2 types of centralization... 
1. Centralization or reduction of peer to peer spending.
2. Centralization of node base.
Reducing the peer to peer nature of the ability to spend is far more dangerous than seeing centralization of nodes.  There are other ways to guarantee nodes aren't pulling off any nonsense.
Once on-chain transactions become a small fraction of total transactions, you have really changed the nature of how bitcoin works.  2nd layer solutions can never be as secure or decentralized as main chain solutions.

I am not apathetic, and I don't believe that either of you have an attitude that will bring greater good.  The right thing to do from the beginning was to deploy on chain scaling solutions including schnorr and then focus more resources along those lines before ever touching changes which radically alter the system.  Segwit was the wrong thing at the wrong time for a number of reasons.  When you force something like it on the community through heavy handed manipulation of discussion combined with divisional attitudes like yours, people don't just go to sleep.  If I were you, I'd expect more serious fighting over 2X, and a dramatic hash power battle if the wrong decisions are made.

The purpose of segwit is not to fix transaction malleability.  That is a by product.  Its main purpose is to enable lightening networks (layer 2).  Instead of the incredibly simple layer 1 upgrade that the bitcoin cash guys pulled off in a single month, Bitcoin Core devs and propaganda team have spent 3 years (since 2014 when this debate began in earnest) blocking this basic upgrade while repeatedly making decisions which reduced the basic usability of layer 1.  For those of us with technical skills, it has been fairly obvious that their purpose was to reduce functionality until the hive mind's anger pot boiled over and then everyone would demand *any* change, rather than simply doing the easy and proven solution.  This is the only way they could get their code accepted.
I too am a software engineer, and I have been involved with bitcoin since 2012.  I watched this sub devolve from the fun and open place it was to the type of place that would suggest a "vocal minority" is responsible for hijacking the discussion.  
This couldn't be further from the truth.  The majority here was pro big blocks by far until the censorship began.  theymos' policies are directly responsible for the division.  You can read my comment history from 2015 commenting directly to theymos telling him about the consequences of the actions he was taking.  Yet he persisted.  This was a well thought out strategy, and now the "narrative" is all one sided.

I don't have enough knowledge to speak authoritatively on this, and I don't have enough time to research right now since I am in the middle of creating a multi-threaded elevator simulator.  But my understanding is that payment channel owners cannot steal funds, but they can lock the entire channel and prevent the coins from returning to the main chain.
And really, as soon as your funds are in a given channel, the code running that channel dictates all, so obviously trust is important to some degree even if your channel of choice is open source and automated.  Unless some hard coded default settlement time back to the main chain is embedded in your payment channel code, what is the assurance that the chain manager will ever settle back to main chain?

These are not remotely the same thing.  Scarcity of the total number of tokens has no impact on velocity of usage or total number of users in the system because the token itself is nearly infinitely divisible.  On the other hand, the artificial fee market slows the velocity of usage and limits use cases while driving users off the main chain and to other options.  These are two different types of limits with impacts on completely different economic factors  
@_date: 2016-11-14 16:07:10

BU?  Don't care, never did.  What I care about is that my holdings remain secure and that I maintain the ability to make transactions directly on-chain without having to go through any centralized side routing network.  The ones failing that are core.
You may not like it but there can be a million attempts at alternative implementations before someone gets one right.  Nothing is stopping the large and growing body of people who want the ability to directly transact with each other on-chain.  The developers are getting better with each iteration too, as is seen by the relatively smooth bitcoin cash start.  And when they finally do come up something that is right enough to take majority hashpower, that will become bitcoin while the current boondoggle is forced to change its proof of work and create its own alt in order to satisfy its narrow focus.  Toot-toot.

Nodes are unimportant.  Enough nodes to have a functioning setwit2X system can be spun up in 20 minutes.  Users and hashpower are what is important important.  If users, exchanges, and businesses decide to use the segwit2X coins, then 2X chain will succeed regardless of the 5K people running core nodes.  They can all continue to remain as they are and it would still be completely insignificant in the scheme of things.

The question you should ask yourself is "does proof of work change?"  The answer is no.

Bitcoin can be valuable for different reasons and can be accepted and used by different people in different ways. There is value is a publicly accepted settlement layer just as there is value in a peer to peer cash system. If the people using it for these different things see a need to have their own flavor of bitcoin that is more specifically tailored to their needs, it is just fine with me and it is certainly not "malicious" just because it doesn't fit your mental model.  Being malicious implies that it is somehow trying to disrupt or hurt the original chain.  This is just not what is happening.
In the end, it doesn't matter what chain I use as long as there is something cheap enough to actually use to buy stuff from purse and send stuff to my buddies. For me that means I will use whichever system offers the cheapest fees and has the easiest to use wallets. If people see a need for two systems, it doesn't hurt bitcoin, it just expands the scope of the crypto currency world.

One think I don't understand is: does it matter how close the first 'xt spec' block occurs to the initiation of the actual implementation of 101?  Once 750 blocks occur, the fork happens, but that doesn't necessarily imply that any blocks will be mined that separate xt from core any time soon due to soft limits.  It could be many months before an actual block larger than 1MB, and thus "out of spec" is actually produced.  Am I understanding this incorrectly?
@_date: 2015-08-28 20:53:13

His point is that if fee models are intended to be kept the same, then it is urgent we act now rather than wait til later.  Current users have always believed that the cap would be changed before fee markets came into to play for many years, and also, new user adoption will be inhibited by increased fees.  If we are to avoid the premature development of a fee market, then yes, it is urgent to act now.  If you believe the fee market developing now is the right thing for bitcoin, then no it isn't urgent.  
But as several people have pointed out, allowing a fee market to develop now would be disingenuous due to a clear historical president for a **long term** fee market to develop.  Fee markets don't need to exist to incentivize mining for probably 20 years, and maybe longer if we see a huge increase in user base and adoption.  That increase is of course partially predicated on keeping the system cheap and accessible so that people in 3rd world countries can use the systems micro transaction capabilities without loosing significant percentages of their value to fees.  Pushing adoption in third world countries also has a strong president among the bitcoin community, and would be much more difficult under an increasing fee structure.

This is evidenced by the fact that whether or not a pool disregarding its own additionally mined blocks is technically called "orphaning," is relatively meaningless to the larger points being made.  I looked at what Gavin was doing as a sort of debate tactic.  Peter Todd on the other hand took what Gavin said and then overly focused on it while blowing up and sounded like a child.

This is a main point I have been making for a long long time.  Bitcoin will survive block size issues, and nearly all other issues it will encounter, but if the privacy issues are not corrected, something else will take its place.  Andreas drives this point home.  This is the most important issue facing bitcoin, and the most technologically challenging.  Fix this and bitcoin is unstoppable.  It will be difficult, and it will take a long time.  Don't be impatient, and do it right.

There is a lot of work being done in the zerocoin world that will hopefully eventually create a working system that bitcoin than then adopt.  I have heard at least one of the core devs that have said they are planning on working on privacy issues, but they "can't afford to make a mistake."  So, they are reluctant to do anything at this point.  I think this issue should be worked on, but it may be many years before the tech from zerocoin proves itself and then gets adopted by BTC.

What?  I was replying to you.  Get your multiple accounts mixed up?  


What is your point?  The lightning network has already been discussed, along with many other of your potential all in one solutions that don't exist.  And you sit there and present these hypotheticals while knowing good and well that it will have years of unknown consequences on the network, and also knowing that it will by nature change the basic structure of how bitcoin works.  Compare that to the working, and thoroughly tested solution that already exists, and only requires simply raising the block sizes.  I'll take the one that keeps bitcoin the main focus, and has been shown to have no negative consequences. 
And whats with you "shutting down your XT node?" comment?
You are acting like you suddenly now have some magical realization that bypasses the last month of debate.  People don't just run an XT node and then shut it down because their ideological basis suddenly shifted. It isn't that easy to spin up a node, and it isn't like you made the decision casually.  I'm beginning to suspect you of some kind of manipulation with this post.  Your reasoning for this post, and for your supposed shift in ideology seems very suspicious.

The author shows that the realistic minimum must be 67% for there to be any significant chance that the 750 block in 1000 would be hit, and the chances are low at that (less than 1% even after months).  That is 2/3 of a giant network.  I personally believe that the percentages that include higher numbers (around 70%) are perfectly reasonable.  Previous solutions to bitcoin standoffs were implemented at 55%.  This is not a bug, it was designed as it is.
The 3rd argument he is making may be legit, but I'm not entirely clear what it is saying.

You are right that people other than engineers should have a lot more leadership, but the people best suited to be making decisions about bitcoins future must have knowledge of the software structure and have at least a decent idea of how it works.  In this way they can know what a real limitation is vs something that is politically motivated.  It should be people who have both levels of skills who make the important decisions.

No I don't know about the architecture more deeply than everyone in core, but I do know enough to know that many or most of the things that are floated as reasons to not increase block size by a moderate amount are either complete fabrications or are rooted in opinion and then passed as fact. When people question or disprove them, they are either banned, censored, or their position is passed off as nonsense with appeal to authority arguments.  I watched this debate develop and it has always been like this.  The only thing "hard" in bitcoin's software base is the cryptography which has actually been well explained to the public now... but I'd say any appeal to authority argument that is not related to cryptography is bunk.
Architecture and design aspects are easy to learn, and I'd imagine with good documentation, most competent c++ engineers could understand everything structurally about bitcoin within a week or so, and be able to contribute meaningfully fairly soon after that.

If your coins exist on two chains where they didn't before, that doesn't change the fact that they are your coins.  It may be a pain for the custodial services to deal with, and there may be no current precedence, but the coins that result from the fork on both chains are yours.  If the custodial service decided to claim them, that would be theft.  And they should absolutely provide a way for their customers to access them as well as account for it properly.
On the other end, I sure as hell wouldn't want to have any coin on any exchange while they are sorting it out.

It is absolutely true.  There is hard data and even a paper on this topic by Peter_R.  Gavin's patch attempts to increase a cap that moves in time tangential to network bandwidth average increases. I'm not sure why it is necessary either, but he would argue that it will prevent spam while increasing network capacity.  I'd rather have his proposal than nothing at all because it at least holds pace with network and continually increases in the future.  I do think something could be made that is better, but no one has proposed anything better yet.

If you want to get them back, you might need to turn your phone off immediately and send the phone to someone who has the capabilities of data recovery.  It might be possible unless you have blown over that part of the hard drive already.  It might also cost a bit, but with bitcoin, you never know how much it will be worth.  I would personally put the phone away immediately and attempt recovery.  You may even be able to do it yourself if you are qualified.

If bitcoin development happens logically, it will follow alternative tech in this regard.  There is no reason that bitcoin should be the first to implement ZKSNARKs for example.  This is something that would be worth building an entire alt ecosystem just to test.  That was what zerocoin and zerocash was supposed to be.  And while those guys are slowly making their way through the academia process, they sure have taken their time. 
Perhaps it is time that an alternative network be developed for the sole purpose of testing the tech that the zero team has created so far.

My initial thoughts are that this will shift too much power to mining syndicates, which is something we have already have a problem with.

I agree that there will be quite the shit storm.  But the fact that their will be shit storms doesn't really matter.  In the end, either bitcoin adopts these features, or something else will beat bitcoin.  This may be 50 years away, but what it will mean is that the 'traceable' aspects of bitcoin will remain intact for governments, charities, and other public necessities, while privacy will remain intact on a fundamental level for individuals.  
The best of both worlds can be developed, should be developed, and will be developed.  And if bitcoin doesn't succeed in this endeavor in the long term, it will fail.  Anonymity features need to exist for private individuals, while governments who are paid by those individuals need to be tracked.  Both of these features are important. 
...Yeah there are a lot of hurdles for BTC to jump considering it is the first.  Later alts can skip all the early hurdles and only tackle the later issues.  They will have the advantage of seeing where BTC failed, and just continuing from there.  If BTC is too slow to react to its failures, it will lose.

Raising the block size is the most heavily tested solution and the most simple.  The "centralization" that comes from increase in the block size means that a small portion of the people running nodes in poor internet countries cannot continue running nodes.  On the other hand, the "centralization" that comes from high fees mean that significant use cases disappear, and with them huge volumes of users.  The loss of millions of users and use cases is far worse than the loss of a few nodes.

Don't conflate the issues...  Bit blocks makes sense regardless of the other changes.  Although I still have yet to see a reason why unlimited blocks aren't being given serious consideration.  Gavin and Mike included the other changes to XT for reason that aren't nearly as important as increasing the block size.

Although the technical justification behind what the author (and the japanese judge) are saying is correct, I think a new definition of ownership should be applied.  The private key itself has no value, but the entire point of holding the private key is to give someone access to the tokens it controls.  You could say that the owner of the private key owns the control, which is where value is derived.  
When people talk about owning bitcoin they are talking about ownership over the control elements, and this should all be accepted as part of the term 'ownership' in regards to bitcoin.

You are convoluting arguments here and making it seem as though I don't recognize the benefits of the attributes we are talking about. I most certainly do see the benefits, but the reality is as I said whether you like it or not; centrally controlled blockchains already have succeeded and more and more examples will develop over time.  I expect to see currency unions between companies, countries, and even smaller groups that develop all over the world using this technology, and it most certainly will work.  And it will work well because there are benefits that exist because of central control structures.  This is where we differ, while I recognize and understand the positives and negatives of both systems, you seem to only be able to recognize the benefits of the one that you support while ignoring the benefits of the systems you don't.

Man, credit cards charge about 3 percent here in the states.  I frequently sent money to individuals, but I am abnormal.  You are mostly correct that the convenience of credit cards or bank transfers is great in many cases, but there are many use cases where BTC makes more sense.  For example, I had to send someone money on paypal yesterday.  For a $550 transfer, it was either I pay a $16 fee or the receiver did (I paid it).

This depends on the network bankcoin develops.  They could potentially decentralize their infrastructure in an attempt to mimic the characteristics of the bitcoin network that make it secure.  And some of them could likely do a damn good job if they were willing to spend significant capital on creating and maintaining infrastructure.  This would add costs to their network that bitcoin doesn't hold, but it is plausible that networks could develop that functioned very well and were centrally controlled, or even "locally centrally" controlled; meaning that they were a group of banks that created a common currency shared between them and all participated in the maintenance of the network.

Centralization is a strawman argument.  Centralization will not occur unless actual block sizes increase rapidly, not just the cap.  And raising the cap means virtually nothing regarding block sizes unless there is actually a strong market incentive for miners to increase block size.  These are two separate issues.  
If the actual block sizes are increasing rapidly, it will be due to mass adoption so we will need them increased anyway.  As it is, block sizes will always be the smallest possible because increases in block sizes directly increase the probability of orphans.  Probability of orphans are one of the primary factors in a miners decision making process, and since miners are who decides how big the blocks are, they will always be as small as possible.

There isn't really any reason. Litecoin is fine and is one of the most heavily used coins behind bitcoin, but there are lots of people with extreme passions regarding alt coins in general, and they will downplay any coin people talk about that isn't bitcoin.  
The current crypto sphere doesn't need nearly as many alt coins as there are, and many of them turn out to be scams, so being opposed to them has some merit, but not as much merit as those who would demonize them would lead you to believe.  In fact, a lot of those coins act as a sort of testbed for bitcoin in that they push the envelope and test new technologies.  Eventually, if bitcoin doesn't show that it can adapt and fix issues like its user privacy problem, it may even be taken over as the primary coin some day.

I think you are right entirely but to add to that i think we shouldn't have much of a fee system for many years.  Right now the block rewards are more than enough incentive for security purposes and fees limit some use cases right of the top.  So if this test results in an improvement in the fee model I don't think it will be relevant unless we are so inept that we never end up figuring out how to get consensus around an improved block scaling system.   If we can't do that though, then that limits use cases even more than a fee system.   Either way we lose because limiting use cases at this stage is a terrible idea since we really have no idea what portions of the protocol will be adapted most quickly in the future.

Who in this conversation said it was going to replace visa?.. No one. 
You came into this conversation attempting to negate every single thing that I claimed as positive.  Yet you didn't actually say how those positives weren't valuable beyond some wild claims about speed and security and then saying that some of the competition has the same abilities.  That isn't an argument.
And this isn't about you having a "different vision," this is about you not acknowledging any value what-so-ever.  In fact, this "counter-cyclical asset" concept is the FIRST thing positive you have acknowledged about BTC in this entire thread.  That makes you sound like a shill because it is ignoring the reality that bitcoin has many positives advantages in many different applications.  Even if you can't personally see those advantages, it doesn't matter.  BTC's transaction volume is growing rapidly every day and it is doing so because there are countless use cases for it.  You denying this makes you sound like a shill regardless of what you say.  And getting pissy that someone called you out on this isn't going to help your case.

You didn't address his point that just because the max block size is larger doesn't mean that miners will fill them.  There won't be jumps because the miners will make the best economic decisions for themselves and this is directly related to the probability for orphaning blocks.  Even if we made the caps unlimited right now, the blocks wouldn't go beyond 1mb for quite a while.

I think that you are thinking a little narrowly.  If bitcoin fails, crypto based and blockchain based systems won't fail.  They may be set back, but they will rebound.  The tech is so good and offers so many advantages over traditional systems, that it will come back in one way or another.

I wouldn't discount this.  It is the beginning of an effort of the legacy heavily capitalized banking system to adapt a centralized to the blockchain tech we use today. 
Just because something is centralized doesn't mean it is innately bad.  In fact, there are a great deal of benefits to something that is centralized.  These benefits are generally out-weighted by the benefits of a decentralized system, but they are real benefits that should be looked at with real open minded scrutiny. 
The concepts you mention of banks creating a type of banking union aren't crazy either and aren't really a joke.  That concept could be very very powerful.  Imagine a currency union like the Euro where the participants are required to provide a huge volume of computational power and increase it on a yearly basis.  The amount of computational power that a group of 20 or 30 nations could put into securing a blockchain would make that coin extremely secure.  The security issues would exist only if the protocol wasn't designed to allow the counties to use their own software, but these are issues that could be addressed by studying the existing bitcoin network, and also by attacking the bitcoin network and the studying the effects as a test for your own network's vulnerabilities. 
It would accomplish two goals at once for the new currency union... It would cause bitcoin to be constantly having to adapt to fend off the attacks, and it would provide them with information that would increase their own security.  This could also potentially cause irreparable damage to the bitcoin network since we are decentralized... we can't exactly adapt to issues quickly whereas a centralized system can adapt instantly.

Ripple seems to be doing just fine, and most of the top alts are controlled by a single developer.  They aren't blowing up world wide like bitcoin is, but it is easy to imagine a currency union like the European Union being created where it is centrally controlled, but the network is distributed.  Blockchains have characteristics that would be incredibly practical in situations like that, yet the union would still maintain the ability to mint currency centrally.  It would be just like the current Euro except you can do data science on it and it would be publicly viewable so corruption problems would be able to be monitored by everyone.  There are really so many benefits that blockchains provide over traditional systems that I expect companies, unions, and countries will eventually use them for almost everything that is public facing.  Think voting, taxes, payments to public officials, city fee collections, etc... All these things benefit from a verifiable and public facing blockchain.  The centralization of control doesn't reduce any of these benefits.

This was not a woosh scenario.  Your ideas were already well though out and discarded.
Decentralization and trustlessness are not necessary to make a functional and secure blockchain.  
Centralization does not mean that the nodes, storage, and mining couldn't be broken into many different pieces with many different geographic locations as well as on many different platforms.  The core decision making could still be centralized while maintaining distributed networking.  Those are the things that provide security. 
And trustlessness doesn't matter in most business scenarios in the modern world. 
If IBM builds a blockchain, you can be assured that the infrastructure will be distributed while the coding will be centrally controlled.  And you won't need trustlessness because IBM will stake their professional reputation on it.  Most companies in the modern world could care less about trustlessness. 
And mind you, I am not arguing that there aren't tremendous benefits to those attributes being part of a blockchain system.  I am arguing however that they are not necessary to make a successful and functional system.  
If you truly believe that a system like bitcoin couldn't exist without those characteristics, then I don't think you are really being honest with yourself. 
@_date: 2015-07-23 04:08:14
I don't think they are looking at it like that.  From what I have read, they are cautiously approaching the privacy issues because they have recognized that they are "so important that they can't afford to be done wrong."  I agree with this perspective although I'd like to see more effort being expended on those issues.  They are incredibly important to bitcoins survival, and although I think the block size caps should be removed entirely, bitcoin will survive whatever happens to the block size.  It will not survive if its privacy issues are not corrected though because something else will absolutely come along that will solve all the issues from the ground up.

I don't think that you could collectively get an entire pool full of people to agree to such a policy, so once it was found out, all the members of the pool who don't agree with the policy would move to another pool, thus reducing the pools size.  It wouldn't be a risk any pool would likely take.

I'm not aware of free interbank transfers existing in the States, and regardless the last time I transferred money to Germany I was hit with a $50 transfer fee.  Sure the litany of apps you mention can do that, but bitcoin is more widely used, and doesn't rely on a centralized company that can be hacked.  
But you are certainly onto something though with the apps, although they simply aren't as widely used.  For example, I just bought a classical guitar yesterday for bitcoin.  The business took credit cards, money orders, paypal, and bitcoin.  No mention of the other apps.  I thought it was a fluke so when I was doing my research, I called another classical guitar store in Atlanta.  They also surprisingly took bitcoin along with traditional methods, but nothing more.

This isn't about businesses or big wigs being able to shield their coins.

If it keeps going the way it is, there will certainly be a thriving black market, but you will have to make yourself an outlier just to have basic financial privacy that should be the default anyway.

Fee markets don't need to develop yet for bitcoin to be successful.  
Block rewards are more than sufficient to incentivize mining and will continue to be for many more years.  The concept of a fee market being a primary driver for development now is premature.  It should be included in structural long term plans, but the reality is that the only people who want higher fees right now are those who will profit from them, and they will do so at the cost of user adoption since the virtually non-existent fees is one of the primary motivations for people to use BTC.

The transaction spammers are a different issue.  Although we have no idea who they were, they didn't break any actual laws which is completely different than the DDOS'ers.

And claiming that the people visiting the other subs are in the 1000 to 2000 people is pretty silly.  XT alone has over 13k suscribers and it is defunct now.

I disagree.  Disconnecting critical infrastructure features from market driven decision making is not in the spirit or the best interest of bitcoin.  All aspects of bitcoin should be governed by the free market.

On top of what everyone said, if craig somehow came across the keys, it would be the worst thing that ever happened to bitcoin.  
Obviously I say that within the context of knowing craig is not satoshi, so if he "came across the keys" it would because some *likely shady* deal he had with someone who actually was satoshi.  Of course then he would claim he was satoshi, but there is literally nothing he can do to make me believe he is satoshi after all the fraud, lies, plagerism, and general bullshit.  
Also, it is basically a sure thing that craig knows nothing about satoshi and that even the idea that he has some deal that will release him the keys after some period of time is complete bullshit as well.

This is moronic.  Playing nice with governments is not the reason bitcoin exists, and it is certainly a terrible strategy for determining development strategies.  Bitcoin was never supposed to be the U.S. spy agencies golden honey pot that it is.
As far as development: It is far more intelligent to make it so that governments can't bring it down regardless of their skills rather than to make recessions on key features just so that they "will be friendly" to bitcoin and then not expect them to abuse those recessions.  It will be adopted based on its merits regardless of governments.

A lot of people are keeping all the bitcoins they buy on our platform, until they understand what to do with them," Marinos said. "In their eyes, now they have bitcoins, they're safe."

*Blocksize* or blockspace isn't "valuable".  The only consideration ever in the block debate was never the size or space in the blocks.  It has always been about network requirements causing a reduction of nodes.  
If you are concerned about the market and what kinds of businesses it attracts to your system, you have your concerns backwards.  You should only care about allowing the businesses to have a free field of competition.  That is all.  The market can govern itself.  Blocksize is just one more aspect of bitcoin that should be controlled by free market forces.  The responsible thing is to tackle this problem now, but we are well past that.

0-conf transaction acceptance is a feature for consenting adults which has now been degraded.  
Imagine a store taking a RBF payment.  They would have to tell the customer to wait til confirmation or add an additional fee... which is a problem in and of itself.  However, in the case that the transaction wasn't included in the next block, the customer would then have to be given an option to increase his fee and then again wait til the next block.  And again, just because they added a fee still does not guarantee a confirmation in the next block, and the store would be FORCED to make the customer wait again.  It isn't as though they could reject the payment, and they can't just give the item to the customer because RBF makes it easy to get the money back for the customer.  In the end, if the customer didn't want to wait, he would be forced to use his RBF to send the transaction back to himself if he wanted to get out of the transaction.  
This is a nonsense for general use cases.
On the other hand, without the possibility of RBF, a store would simply have a service like bitpay which assesses fees, amount of the spend, and network propagation... which takes no more than a few seconds, and then sends a judgement back to the store to finalize or not.  This would work just like the CC network does today, and wouldn't create the possibility of tying a customer up waiting for confirmation times.

His paper shows that the difference between latencies doesn't have much impact on the profitability of selfish miners.  This tells us that while the increase in block size would make it easier to selfish mine, it would be only very slightly easier and not nearly the problem that people are making it out to be.
@_date: 2015-07-16 06:42:53
The beginning of a good argument is that the only given reasons against increasing block size all stem from the concept that large block sizes will create centralization.  However we know these points to be largely strawmen due to the proven fact that miners have a no motivation to fill up blocks due to a rapidly increasing chance for orphans to occur as blocks grow larger.  For this reason, miners will keep block sizes to as small as possible while fulfilling the needs of the network, and this will be done automatically without any need for protocol level central governance.
Increasing the cap or removing the cap does not imply an increase in block sizes.

A free market is something that allows economic forces to guide the system itself.  Letting 5 guys with commit access decide the constraints of a system != free market, or anything related to free markets.  A rational free market would base fees on cost of bandwidth, storage, and the opportunity costs that come from propagation delays.  Those propagation delays already are a natural market based governing force on block sizes.

There is no evidence that the block size being hard limited is necessary for anything except politics and control.  Allowing block sizes to fluctuate would make it impossible to carry out a spam attack for any extended amount of time because the people carrying out the attack would essentially be pumping money into a black hole.  The only way a spam attack can be effective is if the attack can prevent regular transactions from going through.  But there are a number of blocksize control strategies which would enable expanding blocks to eat spam attacks (enough to cost them a lot of money before they can actually cause any issues) and then bring the block size back to a norm (which could be a set point or some moving target).  
The block size debate was complex and there were a lot of good ideas (even by core devs).  You can read the history and see a lot of the ideas if you try.

Simple.  The store tells the customer to pay again with a reasonable fee, and if the original payment goes through, they just send it back to the customers return address.  This is not possible with RBF because the customer essentially has the payment locked in limbo as long as it remains in mem pools unconfirmed.  Of course CPFP solves this problem, but CPFP has this effect regardless of RBF.  It wasn't CPFP that was in question and CPFP solves all the issues that RBF wants to, but without any negative side effects.

There are ways to apply fee pressure that doesn't result in infinite storage but are still market driven.  
Seems like a thousand years ago, but most of the core dev's went through a phase where they weren't fighting against a block size increase, but they were discussing how to do it.  There were a lot of ideas proposed that were decent back then, and a lot of them were never refuted.  I would personally be interested in seeing some kind of elastic temporary expansion which would allow increases but apply a graduated pressure based on a distance from a background increase that is based market forces, or based on some measurement of technology that is not controlled by people who have stakes in bitcoin.
This was never a black and white debate.  There were lots of good ideas, and many of them would have worked.  If the debate wasn't shut down, we would have seen more.

Why will fees fall?  Miners can choose which transactions to include in a block, and there is a strong incentive to put as few transactions into blocks as is possible due to the chance for orphans increasing rapidly as the block size increases.  The cap doesn't really have anything to do with the actual size that is entered into the chain other than when things hit the top.  
Control of these spam transactions entering the blocks will likely be solved by the miners, not by changes to the core protocol.

Temporary increases would not *necessarily* do anything at all to a vast majority of nodes depending on how the system was designed.  Meaning that if there was an elastic property which tied itself to technology, the block size increases would only mean temporary bubbles outside of a general trend line.  Of course there are plenty of ideas for this…  But I digress. 
However, consider the future you present. In the version of the system that a hardcoded block size results in, main chain access costs prohibit 99% of usage by normal people.  This leaves very few big dogs who can provide entry or exit points to the main chain from higher layers.
In that scenario, only the few entry or exit points (paying 10's or 100's of thousands in fees per transaction) will care to run full nodes anyway.  Clearly those people can afford to upgrade their nodes.  So at that point, the only reason those nodes would care would be for artificially restricting access to the chain and limiting it to their channels.  This leads to centralization not of nodes, but of main chain access. 
Obviously a balance is a better answer.  And you know who is best at maintaining balances?… yeah free markets.  The solution here is to simply stop believing that you are special and that you somehow know better than a billion people with money.   In order to have free markets here, the block size must be governed by the market.  How that happens is up for debate, but the second we suggest we know the best limit rather than a system that is self governing and is tied to market forces, we lose.

Of course if you look at the statement I wrote, which is all true... there is basically no one out there who would actively choose to make all those decisions unless they were either idiots, or they were actively trying to scam people.

A lot of things prevent self-validation.  One of them is fees that are higher than a common person can afford.  Validations don't occur if the transaction doesn't exist in the first place.  Also, validations can still be public even if are not self-originated.  The raw increase in data center cost is not as significant as loosing users because the data the centers contain can remain accessible in a decentralized way to the public.  In fact, decentralized servers exist.  The main chain could remain available to the public in a validate way through a decentralized network of servers.  
On the other hand, main chain access cannot remain public with enormous fees.  One of these paths forces people to not be able to use the system at all, while the other allows them to continue using the system with indirect but decentralized validations.  Obviously neither are ideal, but the imperative is that bitcoin must remain low fee on the main chain to remain decentralized.  Any narrative that advocates a path that reduces the user base is false.

I'll throw something out since I've been around a while.  r bitcoin is a heavily censored sub that used to be the greatest thing around but turned into a nightmare.  The mods knew they were dividing the community when they initiated the censorship policies and yet they continued to do so.  
On the other side, in the r btc sub, there is a lot of hate.  Some of it is justified, and some just nonsense.  For some reason they let Craig Wright talk and then act like what he says is new which is just about insane, but there any isn't censorship or when there is, they make the mod logs public.  This says a lot, but I'll leave it up to you to decide what meaning it has for you.
As far as the coins are concerned, I would recommend holding both.  This isn't the dichotomy that both sides present.  However, you should understand that there are serious problems in the governance structure of the current bitcoin.

As opposed to be a total dick, if you have insightful information about the publishing supply chain and its standard practices, why don't you just talk about that rather than spewing an overly repetitive "print the thing."  Clearly that is not what I want to do.  
This conversation could have been ended in one comment without you being a complete jerk, if in the beginning, you had simply stated that there is no difference between one supplier and another in regards to how much the author gets paid.  I'm glad you said this, although with your level of trollishness, I have no confidence that you aren't completely bullshitting me. 
Anyway, the first relevant information to this question you gave is in the last thing you said after a pile of bullshit.  Had you started out with a relevant statement like this, it is quite possible that the thread could have been significantly more useful.  Of course it doesn't matter, it is just r/bitcoin, and if it makes you feel good to be a dick, carry on.

This is a sensationalist headline.  Andresen was talking about how individual implementations of the bitcoin protocol could benefit from the speed with which changes can be implemented under BD leadership vs some kind of imagined consensus policy.  However, if his main point was addressed, then it wouldn't matter because each implementation could do whatever worked best for them...
His main point is that the protocol should be separated from the implementations so that the coding can be separated.  This is a really good idea.

The biggest issue most people have with large block sizes is the potential for centralization due to reduction of the amount of nodes that can handle full copies of the blockchain as well as the bandwidth required to serve the entire blocks.  
A new node structure could be set up in addition to the current node infrastructure, which instead of serving the entire blocks, could serve current snapshots as well as well as a hash that proves the current snapshot is correctly derived from previous snapshots and is correct in relation to the full chain.
Full nodes could continue serving the entire chain as well as snap shot hashes which are updated with each block.  The sub-nodes could then dump blocks each day, or every x amount of blocks, which would reduce the bandwidth they would need to relay because they wouldn't need to serve more than the last x blocks at any given time.  
The bandwidth would still be high if the block size was increased massively, but this would be a significant improvement that would immediately allow smaller operations to run nodes that were provably up to date without having as much of the bandwidth requirement and only a tiny fraction of the storage requirements of a true full node.

Absolutely would be massively different.  No one would use it.  Adoption is clearly predicated on low fees, at least as far as common users are concerned.  If you are going for a high value, low use, settlement network, then the types of people who would use that obviously wouldn't care about fees, but this system was designed for the people, not the fat cat bankers, and it never would have grown to what it is today had it not been for the common user.  There would be zero institutional interest without me and hundreds of thousands of other individual users with small but significant use of bitcoin.  If we had to pay a dollar to use bitcoin every time, we never would have got on board. 
Your concept of nodes being run by banks is not plausible as long as the original vision is kept.  People will run nodes for privacy, security, and because they want to control their own money.  This won't change because the system gets larger.  And your concept of gigablocks is not likely any time soon.  Gigablocks are decades away even if you completely un-limit block sizes.

Litecoin and other alts have tremendous value to the community because they represent free test beds for technology that can be incorporated into bitcoin.

The only real litmus test that should be involved with this is *will the miners add the transaction to their blocks?* ...Not, how can we force competition for block space up enough that miners decisions are made for them.
You are a lost cause if you think that the arbitrary $.01 US dollars is some mystically important fee line that should absolutely be upheld.  Why don't we get to the real heart of the matter...  Your controlled market black magic threshold of what you deem a reasonable fee is based on what you feel, and has nothing to do with the reality of free market economics.  Complaining about the infinitesimally small increase in bandwidth to your node that 1000X the current transactions volume would cost you is a joke when compared to the benefit that would have on the entire ecosystem.

The reviewer doesn't need this "feature" until it is integrated into bitcoin's protocol.  Since bitcoin is based on consensus, and this "feature" has already gone this long without consensus forming around it, it is unlikely to be integrated into the protocol any time soon.  
If in the future it does gain consensus and is integrated into the protocol, then any wallet which calls itself a bitcoin wallet will need to implement the feature regardless of what the personal opinions of the developers are. 
I fail to see how the developers personal positions are relevant in any case since the product they are providing is superior to anything else on the market.

Nothing anyone can do would stop you from having the same choices you already have.  The blocksize could be a billion TB and you would still have the same choices within your own frame.  Increasing the block size NEVER would change your ability to make choices.
However, the people who want blocksizes being bigger can NOT make that choice.  You claim to be for free markets and for people making their own choices, yet you don't argue for those choices even being available when they oppose yours.  
How can you not see the hypocrisy in your argument?  And don't even try the "oh its the consensus" bullshit.  The reality is the group of coders you say shouldn't be controlling the block limit are doing exactly that.

A logical way to handle hard forks would be to pre-schedule them, and phase out backwards compatibilities over iterations.  Long term phase outs could be pre-planned based on logical assumptions.  For example, nlock back compatibility should probably never be phased out because it could mean money loss for some people, whereas most back compatibilities that relate to structural or method dependencies could be phased out in only a few hard-fork cycles.

I've been involved in bitcoin early enough to remember when not sending a fee at all was normal.  The only reason it is any different now is that a group of people have conspired to make it different.  The centralization arguments are weak at best, and the miners are making plenty of money without fees.  $.05 has already priced a huge amount of use cases out of the bitcoin world.  How many use cases do you want to disappear before you decide it is beyond what you consider acceptable?

It has long been known that bitcoin moderators have done heavy handed CSS modifications which change the way comments appear, changes the way upvotes impact comment appearance, changes the way items are hidden vs shown, and generally changes the way that the sub works to something completely different from most of the rest of reddit.  
In addition, they changed their moderation tactics about 2 years ago to kick out any mention of altcoins and forks that weren't sanctioned by core, calling them "not bitcoin".  They accomplished this by implementing auto moderator software run by a heavy handed group of moderators.  Moderators who didn't do exactly what was requested of them were kicked out. The double standard their policies have createdd are blatant though when you see that moderators happily allow discussion of litecoin and USAF along with anything else that supports their narrative while banning people who present alternatives and deleting their posts. 
I've been a member of bitcoin for many years and have seen every one of the changes they made and seen their impact.  This isn't the matrix, but the people in this sub have no idea these things are happening, so there are certainly some aspects this sub shares with the matrix.

He is politicizing this, as you are.  Calling something a solution or not is a political decision, as it is clear that there have been several scaling proposals which would in fact result in long term increases in the number of transactions that the network could process per unit of time (the definition of scaling).
The reason Luke is saying that there aren't any existing solutions is that in his view, certain classes of transactions should be considered spam.  
However, this view point is irrelevant to what should be defined as a "scaling solution" or not.  No single individual's definition of what is or isn't spam should be considered here.  The only thing that should be considered is whether or not there are existing proposals which would lead directly to long term scaling.... which there are.
Ignoring these proposals, or denying that these exist by acting as though they don't qualify as "scaling solutions" is a pedantic semantic pile of bullshit of an argument.  Luke's motivations are absolutely transparent.

There is absolutely no science behind your assertion that gigabytes will be added to the blockchain on an hourly basis in any time frame where gigabytes are not virtually meaningless.  
No plausible scenario aside from explosive growth would create massive bandwidth necessities and massive data storage requirements, and nothing indicates this will occur any time soon.  You guys / girls who incessantly state that this type of data usage will occur as though it were fact are either liars or just parrots of other liars.  There is nothing that shows this will happen, even with unlimited blocks.  In fact, several actual researched models have shown the opposite will happen, that block sizes regulate themselves because of exponentially increasing probabilities for orphans to occur as you attempt to mine blocks with any significantly larger size than the current normal.  
Yet, you ignore this research and instead press ahead with statements backed by what?  Hot air.
Why is [this]( happening while your small block squad presents nothing concrete that shows anything opposite.

I'm not exaggerating it.  I was here in 2012 / 2013 before the moderators changed their policies.  This was a friendly and fun sub with great conversations and a uniquely libertarian / anti-centralized control flavor.  
The pure hate and insults you see are a direct result of the "moderation" policies.  When a select group of people who have a ton of money and time invested into a open source project are suddenly excluded from (all: not just reddit) the main communication channels relating to what they care about, they get angry.  This is a natural and expected response to what the mod team did. 
Theymos and his crew were well aware that these consequences were coming (I know he was aware because I, and many others, told him exactly what was happening when he still participated in conversations), yet they still chose to go this route.


You may not remember this, but there was a period where ALL discussion of any forks or variations on bitcoin (which were labeled by the mods as altcoins) resulted in an instant ban.  Of course that has changed now that the forking is desired by the core team when it suited their own objectives.  Conveniently, even discussions of litecoin are branded as fine now since it enabled segwit.  Even the mention of litecoin would have resulted in an insta ban about 1.5 years ago... Its a double standard that is based on nothing more than Theymos and his team's own wishes.  
The fact that they have relaxed their moderation policies lately does not discount that they are responsible for the split in communities in the first place and the fact that years of progress has been stalled as a direct result of their policies.

Nobody has ever shown hard evidence to support this.  As a theory it is fine, but there are just as many theories that say decentralization will increase as user base does because more individuals and institutions will run nodes as the user base and demand for security increase.  
Long and short, don't buy those theories without considering all possibilities.

But it is still irrelevant to the point.  A reviewer should be reviewing the wallet for what it is, not what it might be after some future event that may or may not occur.

Excellent comment.  
I think part of the solution is that this community could find guidance in some existing long term successful projects.  C++ is a great example.  The core standardization committee's purpose is to create a standardized protocol for the language.  Bitcoin's core teams could behave like that committee.  This would require separating the protocol from the implementers, but I think this would solve a lot of problems as long as the committee was built in a fair and diverse way.  
C++ languished in sluggish progress for a long time, but the governance system lately has been producing massive leaps.  Why and how such a big and entrenched system went from molasses style progress to giant leaps could be key to bitcoin.

They are literally forcing people at gunpoint to finance the guns that are used to hold them.  And in the meantime, they use the excess guns and bombs that they make using stolen money to start mindless war throughout the world.

Nobody owes anyone anything except an even playing field, so stop acting like this concept of entitlement is something anyone believes in.  However, this is not an even playing field.  You and the rest of the shills have successfully manipulated things so that there is no free market, there is no free choice.  And now you are claiming that the opposition is trying to stifle choice by asking for more choices?  This logic is so fucked that it is obvious you are trolling.

I'd suggest you approach this with an open mind.  You are talking to someone who has been here from the beginning and has had first hand experience directly.  I even directly talked to theymos while it was happening and noted its effects...
I'm not asking you to trust my first hand experience, although you are welcome to verify it, but I am telling you that what you see in r bitcoin is not reality.  If you can't come to see it, then maybe you aren't willing to see it.  Maybe you are have some emotional investment this sub?  Chasing sunk cost is not worth it.

People came here to discuss things because it was free in the first place.  Now you have the first mover advantage, and that takes a long long time to beat.  In some cases it becomes impossible. 


No you don't.  You can only make one choice, so you aren't actually choosing anything.  If both options were available, then you would have a choice.  And don't act like you even have a real option with classic or whatever.  This is simple logic that again seems to confuse you.  If you only have one option, then you aren't making a choice. 


If this is the end of your argument, then why spend 10 posts back and forth with me attempting to convince yourself that you are the one who is for free markets.  The clear free market decision is to give people choice, not for core to make it.  Core is simply rejecting giving people a choice and instead making it for them.  Don't act like you are for free markets if you are simultaneously for stifling choice.

What is great about this is that it might not be realistically how this will happen, but for bitcoin to succeed, it needs decentralization of the implementations just as much as it needs decentralization in the broader sense.

There is nothing Wright could do to bitcoin that would have any long term impacts.

It might be bad for smaller miners and for total security, but whether its 'bad for bitcoin' depends on how badly someone wants to attack the network as well as number of other factors...  I think that the stagnation of mining power is more of a reflection of what bitcoin is doing as whole rather than it being a bad thing in itself.
@_date: 2015-02-01 22:27:50
No, I am talking about coins specifically traced through mixers.  The problem with mixers is generally that the inputs and outputs are easy to guess because they always fall within a certain percentage of the value of the original outputs, and they conform to a specific time line that is easy to trace.  I think there is one mixer that creates a delay, but it means waiting sometimes significant times to get your coin back.  
The mixers are also on far too small a scale to be effective.  Most of them are between 1 and 50 bitcoins as a max and this is simply not enough because it usually means that only 1 to 50 inputs are used which makes it easier for detectives to follow.  
I have seen people right here on reddit follow coins through mixers on several occasions.

This isn't rocket science, so don't act like this happening wasn't the plan all along by again... A SMALL GROUP OF CODERS... not free market economics.
And stop combining the concept of free choice over your own node with the obviously not free choice concept of forced economic decisions by a group of coders on the miners. 
Obviously, you are free to run a node however you choose, but this isn't about nodes.  This is about forcing the ecosystem to behave in a certain way from the top down which is what you have said you are against several times.  Yet you spout nonsense supporting it.

Purse.io is the only reason I spend bitcoins, because services like gift and that other one like gyft don't give enough of a discount to really recoup the losses from bitcoin dropping value over the last 12 months.  
If I had bought in earlier, or perhaps bought in more recently since bitcoin started its uptrend started, I would be glad to buy more stuff at any discounts.  But in the meantime, I'll stick with the delays and semi-questionable practices of purse.  They haven't failed me yet although sometimes they take a while.

Blocksize increase will have no meaningful change in your bandwidth or storage fees.
Blocksize increase will force to make 0 changes to your existing nodal relay habits. 
Blocksize increase will save you money... that is if you even actually use bitcoin.
NO blocksize increase FORCES the entire network to pay more for everything. 
The only thing here that removes choices from the market is not increasing blocksize.  Call me fascist if you want, you are the one removing choice even when facts slap you in the face.

You lose none of the so called "choice" you get by increasing block size while the opposition absolutely loses choice by keeping block size where it is.  
If you really cared about choice, you would promote having unlimited caps since this doesn't have any bearing on your ability to choose, but having limits inhibits some people's choice. 
Since the alternative option inhibits nothing of your freedom, yet you spend countless hours here on reddit arguing against it, it is clear you are a troll.  I ask you again, are you getting paid for this?

Zerocash / zerocoin will have network effect because the scientists behind it are doing it in a brilliant way.  The have modularized the entire system and are creating a huge volume of solutions to every problem.  When they consider themselves done, the system is going to be more robust than any other crypto out there because there will be more ways to do each component than any other crypto, and the implementations of each part will be far more vetted than other crypto's because they started from a much larger and higher level knowledge base.  
That said, other cryptos are welcome to take pieces of the zero world and use them themselves.  So zero is a win win for everyone.  Monero may or may not be great, but zero's modular design is a whole new class of architecture for cryptos.

In mathematics a limit is a "cap" of sorts.  In computer science we refer to caps as "big O" loosely.  The concept of a maximum growth rate is very important within the algorithmic thinking world.  ETH will grow indefinitely but its "big O" will always be a very very small linar or big O (N) rate.  Saying that ETH is no cap is not really showing a realistic understanding of growth rates.  ETH has a cap of a very very very slow growth rate relative to its required use within the context of its pay to use scheme.

I like SNARKS, but I am not a huge fan of altcoins.  I think the technologies that altcoins create should be integrated into bitcoin.  
As far as I know the only coins that have inherent zero knowledge systems built in are shadowcoin, BTCD, and possibly dark coin.  I am very excited about the math happening surrounding "zerocash" or "zerocoin."
There are a number of impressive mathematicians working on the future of SNARKS, and I really like the way they are modularizing the work and creating as many solutions to each module as they can.  In this way, zerocoin/cash should be able to very fluid, as the modules can be implemented in several ways and of course used in different implementations other than zerocoin/cash.  
My hope is that when the math is solid and tested through a number of altcoin platforms in a number of different ways, BTC will integrate these features on a core level.  Unfortunately I am concerned that BTC will be adopted on a greater scale than it is ready for.  Once mainstream interests and governments adopt the tech, it will become far more difficult to make changes to the core because there will be so many competing interests.
I should also say that I do invest in altcoins that show promise in the field of anonymity, but I do so to hold the coin, and as a sort of donation to the developers.  I don't think I will ever see any of that money back.

The entire argument of people who want larger blocks and unlimited blocks is based on research that follows established patterns of historical growth.

And you are predicating your entire argument on this happening.  Why?

This isn't a solution.  The government just writes an algorithm in their coin clearing computers that lets say .01% be from unknown origins.  It accounts for any dust attacks of this nature.  The government's algorithm could be far more complex than that and would still function the same but account for far more variables.  
I may not understand the exact mechanisms behind BTC, but I am not tech retarded.  And yes, the government will police the tech to whatever degree they can.  That is exactly what the NSA is doing.

The problem is that there are so many unique values that it is easy to associate one unique value with its flow through the chain.  Values will change as inputs and outputs are added together and whatnot, but basic math allows you to follow the vast majority of transactions through the chain.  The outliers are the ones that are difficult, but the government doesn't need to mess with those... just blacklist them.

Coins moving through coin join have already been traced right here on reddit by amatures.  Coin shuffle improves the situation only by obscuring the inputs and outputs, but in the tracing methods that were shown here on reddit, they didn't need the inputs and ouputs, the simply found them on the chain by using simple logic relating to timing and amounts at the inputs and outputs.  I wish I could find the post.

There is no reason that any new hard fork couldn't just include back compatibility handling capabilities to accomplish this same outcome with things other than structural issues.  Non-compatible changes could have built in exception handling specifically to deal with cases like the presigned nlocktimed transactions.  It isn't like the non-compatible things are unknowns, so each of the specific cases can be handled in new code.

@_date: 2015-02-01 22:21:38
I appreciate your explanation, and I am learning quickly, but from my current understand it still doesn't change anything.  The specifics in the identifying methodology doesn't change my fundamental argument.  As a government, if you can trace an address chain to something you consider illegal, then you can black list any future connecting address.  Since this can occur instantly, it effectively makes separate markets for different groups of coins, and it gives the government the ability to instantly stop any individual or group of individuals from being able to use those coins for legit business within that government's influence.  
If you tried to seed other legal addresses with "tainted" dust, it would be easy for the government to create algorithms in their clearing systems to allow percentages of inputs to be from blacklisted addresses, but this still doesn't help the guy with the bulk blacklisted coin.

The NSA very well may have some concept of who has those coins, but even if they don't, the concept of being traceable is kinda just a side benefit. 
If BTC becomes large enough, the government will just make it illegal to spend coin that is not traceable for whatever reason.  They won't accept that you got this coin or that coin through some guy or whatever.  They will just blacklist it and tell the holders who are anon to fuck off.  
The fact that there even can be a black list or white list is the problem, not the specifics of how you can go about obscuring the coin.  If the coin isn't fundamentally obscured, it is already a problem.

You can chide me for not knowing exactly how it works, but there have been several cases where people right here on reddit followed coin through mixing services with ease.  And these are people with limited access to information and limited resources.  Someone like the NSA, who's main existence is for bulk collection of information and parsing of bulk data into patterns, has an easy time with this.  While some outliers may be able to obscure some transaction through one method or another, this does not change the fact that since the addresses and transactions are distinguishable from one another, the government will easily trace the vast majority of transactions, and they can easily filter addresses who don't comply with whatever laws they create.

Your orders will often get filled rapidly and usually within 24 hours.  However, people who are testing out stolen credit cards sometimes buy your stuff.  When they are caught by amazon's fraud detection system, the buy will be cancelled, and you will have to wait for someone to buy again.
Unfortunately, as far as I know there is nothing stopping the same person from testing his next card on your same item again.  This can cause you to get stuck in a loop where you have to wait two or three days to find out if the purchase was actually legit or if they are just testing bunk cards on you.
I have had someone repurchase the same item 3 times on me and then end up just cancelling entirely in the end.  
I have proposed some changes to purse such as not allowing people to rebuy items for a certain time frame, and also beefing up their reputation system and allowing it to actually matter.  As in, they could easily let people choose whether they want a specific buyer to be allowed to buy their product.  As far as I know purse has not made these changes. 
So basically, my current line of thought is that you should approach purse buys with the understanding that they will eventually get filled, but the way their current system is set up, that could mean several weeks.  If you don't have a critical time frame for what you are buying, it is amazing.

Why? Do you believe that crypto based currencies will not succeed?  Or is it that you don't believe that bitcoin will be the right crypto based currency to succeed?
If you don't believe they will succeed, that would explain your position. But if you do believe they could succeed, then you have to acknowledge that the possibility exists that one or more countries could adapt bitcoin, as well as the possibility for bitcoin to be adapted by one or more large scale markets in any number of places in the world.  
If BTC succeeds over time and proves its security to the world, its benefits will get harder and harder to ignore in large scale markets, while alternatives will have to either compete in both security and money saved, or BTC (or another crypto) will assimilate them.
None of this is crazy.

Most people have no idea what you are talking about.  Most people will not adopt to BITCOIN if they have to learn these kinds of things.  The way forward for bitcoin is things like those apps that allow you to send money to friends easily and socially... like VENMO.  That is what the mainstream wants.  They don't want to think, and they certainly don't want the responsibility of keeping their own coin safe.  I wouldn't believe for a second that dark wallet or whatever is going to be the norm.  
People will download an app from their bank.  It will allow them to access their money and pay through their phone while still providing insurance.  It will also allow them to send money to other people.  Maybe it will use bitcoin on the back end, but the person won't even know it.  And the bank will have no interest in obscuring coin from the governments puppets they are electing, or making mixing the default behavior in their app.  
The only real way forward is to change the protocol to make it inherently obscured.  We are 3-10 years away from THAT.

Let me try this again since I was somehow downvoted to -11 so far for saying the truth.  
If bitcoin goes mainstream, the world governments will impose capital controls and sanctions by registering specific bitcoin which are acceptable, and registering bitcoin which are outliers for whatever reasons the government deems.  Of course this will only occur within the area the government controls... which is virtually every where when you consider that capital controls and sanctions are imposed by blocks of countries that control huge areas of the earth and gladly work together. 
Sure there will be a black market for coins that aren't part of the government white list, but those coins won't be worth nearly as much because of the limitations of where you can spend them.
Why are these limitations possible? BITCOIN IS NOT FUNGIBLE.  You can easily track and mark EVERY SINGLE SATOSHI in existence with simple blockchain tracing techniques.  While you may not be able to tie the bulk of them to a specific human or IP address at this point, the governments of the world will absolutely form a clearing system which will mean that all major retailers will be forced to participate, and you will not be able to spend your bitcoin unless they are cleared by the government.  Again, this is possible because bitcoin ARE NOT FUNGIBLE.
If you don't like it I am sorry, but don't downvote me because you don't like this fact.  
This is one the biggest problems with bitcoin and it the most important problems to address going forward if bitcoin wants to remain viable.  If it is not addressed at a core level then bitcoin will become an incredible tool of government for tracking and restricting behavior throughout the world.

That is a lie.  This place along with several of the other major publication centers where people gain information have been controlled to the point where no reasonable amount of traction has been able to take hold with larger block sizes in the other implementations.  
If you were truly for allowing freedom, then simply allow bigger blocks in the core client and then CHOOSE to not relay them.  It is that simple.
The only reason you wouldn't want this is that you know the reality which is that once big blocks were put into the core client, people absolutely would use them, and people would relay them.  You would be in the minority.

You cannot divorce proof of work from bitcoin.  It is fundamental to the security of the chain.  You can claim whatever you want about who follows who, but in the end, 50% attacks are possible if a large enough contingency of miners decides to carry them out.  Ignoring this and claiming that the miners would never do such a thing because they are following other forces is ignoring the reality that miners are the fundamental element of security.  Without them what we have is not bitcoin...  It is an altcoin.  
I've never suggested they are all powerful, but this sub is full of people who have had so much wool pulled over their eyes, they don't even realize what the purpose of mining is for.  Like you... "miners have no influence."  Are you completely blind?  They literally provide all of bitcoin's security.  
As far as the name bitcoin... bitcoin as a system follows a specific proof of work.  If 51% of miners decided to mine blocks different than what you want but they followed the same proof of work as bitcoin, they would then become bitcoin.  This is a technical action.  It isn't a matter of what you want or think.  It is simply what bitcoin is by nature.  Any block produced by the group with less than 50% of hash power that attempts to go against blocks of the greater than 50% will be orphaned.  You can claim whatever you want, but this is how bitcoin works.

I would suggest talking to a service like purse.io to see if you could get set up with a wish list type of system that could potentially drive customers in bulk to your company.
The problems you would likely run into would be that people frequently test stolen credit cards through these services, and you would likely get some people charging back on you.  However, I and many others use these services frequently because they are a way for us to get serious discounts for our use of bitcoins. So, if you were able to set up this type of connection with those services, you may be able to generate enough sales to make up for the increase in charge-backs and fraud many times over.  
Right now, I think many people don't generally spend bitcoin unless they are getting a significant discount, and these types of services could be a way to funnel discounts to customers without having to loose the revenue on your end. Otherwise, you may have to wait til bitcoin begins to climb in value again before people start to spend significant significant amounts.

It isn't crazy.  Blockchain analysis is miles above what most people think.  In fact, following BTC through mixing services has been accomplished and proven here on reddit several times by people who aren't NSA or some other high level government person.  And you can bet your ass that if regular reddit CS type people can accomplish what they have, the NSA can do far more.  
Hell, the NSA is built on parsing data out of bulk collection of information.  So even if they can't DE-anonymise a certain small group of transactioins, they can get enough to be clear as to which coins are legit and which aren't.  For a future coin clearing system, they already have enough.  And just imagine when the bulk of the populus jumps on board.  You think they will be using different addresses for every transaction?  Hell no.  They will be using bank issued addresses that will provide easy tracing potential for the NSA.  That means that if it becomes mainstream, there will only be very few transactions outside of normal operation, and they will quickly be flagged as unusual and studied more carefully by computers designed to find outliers and drawl associations.  This is like the goose that laid the golden egg for facists in its current form.

You still aren't getting it.  "Miners do not have any influence on protocol decisions" is simply nonsense that is spread through this sub.  Miners can and do influence protocol decisions.  If enough protocol changes were made that forced the miners hands, you would absolutely see a new version of bitcoin.  Forks are possible, and the longest same proof of work chain is what will become bitcoin in these situations.  
This thread started about what defines the name bitcoin, not about political power, but if you think somehow the name bitcoin will be maintained without the active participation of the people who are securing the network, you are just plain wrong.  The reality is they have a lot of power, and nothing will change this aside from changing proof of work, which is creating a new coin.

I can do this with any wallet, so your wallet is no better or worse.


you can do the equivalent of "keeping a card a file" in bitcoin, for services like LaundryLocker (or Uber hopefully eventually) where it charges your account in the background as you use a service, i personally find this more convenient than approving every transaction (unlike a credit card, we give you the ability to limit the max amount the company can charge per time period, and revoke the company's access at any time)
you can do off-blockchain micro-transactions for free which is great for tipping or other small transactions.
These concepts are great, but the limited use cases that exist nearly negate them as an attraction.
In my opinion, the benefits that you describe are currently far less useful to the consumer than having privacy and not having over-site from a bank like entity that is even more intrusive and more effective at information collection than a traditional bank.
You should offer a sub $1000 purchase option like libertyX with 0 requirements for KYC laws, or even an account requirement.  Make it so that anyone can buy them from you anywhere as long as they are buying less than $1k, and make it completely anon.  At least give people a chance to be anon, and if you did this, it would be completely legal.

I'm in the same boat.  And what I have learned in the last two months is that even though I used to think I would never be good at programming... not only am I decent, but I really enjoy it. 
It is just solving a series of complex problems with the knowledge you have while learning new ways to solve them.  It is awesome.  
I'm starting out in python because it does a lot for you, but I plan on moving quickly to other languages once I get the hang of python.  At any rate, as you go, learn to solve problems and don't focus so much on a specific language.  Learn how programming works, and you will be able to apply that knowledge to multiple languages.
Good luck.

I know wtf fungible means, and again, bitcoin is not fungible.  It is easy to trace, categorize (color), and differentiate between any base unit in existence and any other one.  Blockchain analysis can be done by anybody with a computer and some basic tools to analyze the blockchain and can show the entire history of every satoshi in existence. 
  
Don't kid yourself that just because the government isn't forcing coin coloring and clearing right now; that they won't in the future.  If BTC blows up, governments will absolutely take advantage of its lack of fungibility and impose a system of coin clearing on a world wide scale.  In its current state, it is an extremely dangerous tool for potential fascists should they choose to use it.  
This is the number one issue facing bitcoin in my opinion.

I think that your statement on how easy it would be to spread BTC AIDS is the most poignant argument against what I have been saying in all the comments yet.  But, I still don't have any real concept of how that would help someone with a substantial amount of black listed coin get around it.  It might make the algorithms have to be a little smarter and instead of blacklisting all coins in an address because of some small unknown input, just blacklist addresses when .01% or some threshhold of unknown coin is detected.  The algorithms could get very complex without any real delay in the coin validation process and the government is smart enough to make basic logic a part of an automated computing system.

Segwit isn't critical to bitcoin's future and isn't likely to have any bearing on LTC beyond giving it notoriety.  The fact that litecoin has good mobile wallets, solid hashrate for security, and is purchasable at major exchanges like coinbase is what is driving and will continue to drive demand for litecoin.  Bitcoin needs only one thing to stop bleeding market share to alts... a real long term on chain scaling solution.

So basically if we don't turn bitcoin into a cash cow for governments, banks, and large centralized enterprises, he will go to litecoin... good for him.
Lightening networks are fine, but they must compete freely and openly with on chain solutions.
The only logical step forward is to provide both on chain and off chain scaling solutions and let the miners and the users decide what is best through actual market forces.  
@_date: 2017-06-08 18:58:12
There is a difference between providing on-ramps to the core chain vs actually settings up layers.  These added layers are not part of bitcoin's core functionality.  The job of bitcoin core developers is very simple: to improve the core protocol, not to provide second tier software solutions around it.  While providing entry and exit points to core is certainly part of that responsibility, it should end there.  If the lines between these two concepts are being blurred, then it is an indication of a bad governance structure.
@_date: 2015-02-01 20:04:10

@_date: 2017-06-07 02:09:09
I agree that nothing is ready yet, but this is why a number of notable people were suggesting that developers focus on this issue as far back as 2013.  Yet here we are in 2017 and all core has put forward is segwit. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 22:22:00
Access methods for second tier is absolutely the job of bitcoin protocol implementer, and as such, segwit is within this context and is reasonable.
However, the point that most people have been making since 2013 (and before) is that scaling needed to be the focus of core devs.  The leadership ignored this focus despite public protest in favor of segwit; In fact, they even went so far as to ignore obvious solutions in favor of a the newly invented segwit and shut down opposing viewpoints through the primary U.S. communication channels regarding the matter.
Their motivations behind this weren't part of some road map that god dropped on bitcoin... they made the road map long after the problem came up, and they made the road map to suit their own project goals instead of the goals of the users and miners.   
Talking about HTTP as not being part of the internet is silly, but http didn't come before basic operations (like the ability to grow) were handled.

Layer 2 is inherently less secure.  The entire purpose of bitcoin is to act as a bunch of fancy rules about the process of adding to a immutable, shared, and public ledger.  Mutability in bitcoin is directly tied to the number of copies of that ledger exist in the public.  Layer 2 solutions do not necessitate less people having copies of the ledger, but they tend to result in this since the sub nets consist of subsets of bitcoin user base.  This means that while they aren't *necessarily* less secure, in practice they will be because the micro ledgers that they create are not required as a fundamental aspect of the side chain to be shared the same way the block chain is.  
There is a reason all the components of bitcoin are necessary for its security, and no amount of lip service is going to magically make all the components that some layer two doesn't have add up to the same level of security as bitcoin.

The miners will not ignore the health of the network as collective body.  They know the importance of decentralization as one of bitcoin's main selling points, and they know it will certainly not work as "bitcoin" if it is not decentralized.  As they did in the past, miners will both soft limit block size caps as well as self limit their percentage of hash power in order to maintain that decentralization and thus maintain the health of the organism as a whole. 
You cannot call yourself an anarcho-capitalist and ignore the macro scale economic impact on individual behavior.  Individuals will self regulate in order to preserve the organism as a whole...  Nobody wants to kill the goose that lays the golden egg, and if for some reason someone does, bitcoin will lose market share until the economic incentives for continuing that behavior will cause that bad actor to leave the space.  Then bitcoin can flourish again.

@_date: 2017-06-17 17:07:58
Yes it is.  It is a structural governance difference, not a technical difference.  Once monero reaches a level of popularity where bitcoin is now, it will still successfully be doing the same. 
@_date: 2017-06-21 05:20:29
You are thinking about this wrong.  Miners are capable of self regulating block sizes through soft caps just as nodes are capable of refusing to relay blocks of sizes greater than whatever they feel like.  
This has already been proven to work in bitcoin.  Miners previously self-regulated and used soft caps to prevent spam for almost the entire existence of bitcoin before the network volume increased to where it is now.  And they did this based on market forces that had nothing to do with any 3rd party forcing anyone to do anything.


Why do you or anyone else get to "force" self-regulation?  My point, and the point that Satoshi made by creating bitcoin and subsequently writing about and developing it is that markets self-regulate without coercion.  The philosophy I believe in says that the self-regulation you want will be done automatically by the market if that self-regulation is better for the market than the alternatives.  
With this in mind, the right way to handle this issue is to open the chain cap while providing segwit as well as on and off ramps for sidechains and other entry / exit points for layer two. 
Let the market decide whether they want to shoulder the cost of increasing the block sizes they actually transfer vs. shouldering the reduced security inherent to layer 2.  This should be a market decision as everything in bitcoin should be.  If the layer two solutions are better for the market and provide good enough security, those will be used as opposed to layer 1.  But either way, it should be a choice made by the users and miners and the market as a whole, not a small group of guys who arbitrarily dictate caps based on what their definition of spam is.
@_date: 2015-02-01 21:03:19
I disagree.  I don't think it would be so easy to add a layer to a truly anon coin.  For example: if you add a tracing layer to something like a SNARK, then what you are really doing is creating a new blockchain and then associating discrete values of whatever coin it is with your new blockchain.  The problem with that is that you don't have the inherent security associated with market participation in the blockchain that we see now.  
If SNARKS become reality, I don't think that it is possible to add a layer.

The math says that markets can make those decisions on their own without you dictating it.  Open the caps, and let the miners self regulate the sizes.  Then we can also have lightening or whatever else and let users figure out which they prefer.  There is no technical reason that a dramatically larger block can't exist despite the persistent propaganda that might lead you to believe there is.  You arbitrarily deciding what the limit should be is presumptuous and shows a level of arrogance that you should seriously get checked.

I think the U.S. is going to be forced to drive up interest rates within the next few years.   The FED has a lot to think about, and competing with deflationary currencies has to be on their mind.  As people learn that they can get discounts on their normal purchases through sites like gyft, they will have little incentive to stay in U.S. dollars.

Segwit does not fix layer 1.  It helps some things, but the most significant thing it does is make it possible to provide entry points for layer 2.  The right solution to layer 1 problems is to fix those problems, not to offload them on a less secure layer.

Of course I have heard of this.  Bitcoin will not suffer from the tragedy of the commons because all actors must look out for their own interests as well as the interests of bitcoin as a whole.  
If for some reason they succumb to the tragedy, then bitcoin's future will be cyclical as centralization occurs and then market share is lost until the central figures leave the space.  Then bitcoin will do well again until the centralization phase begins occurring again. 
If this happens, it is part of the natural cycle of markets.  Again, I am not sure how you can call your self an anarcho capitalist without understanding that markets regulate themselves on a micro AND macro scale.

Bitcoin won't succeed if its community based security system is susceptible to attack. And, if Bitcoin stagnates in some middle of the road state, it will eventually become venerable to attacks as technology increases faster than hashrate. When it is successfully attacked on a large scale, the system will fail entirely. 
Conceptualizing bitcoin as being able to exist over time in some middle of the road state ignores the real possibility that the network could be attacked for a relatively small amount of money unless cutting edge technology is constantly propelling the network to larger and larger power. If bitcoin is weak or falls behind moores law, then competitive currencies as well as other enterprises have real incentive to do attack it to gain market share.
This is a strong argument against a stagnant position.

Black is blue dude.  
Average cost of bandwidth in U.S. which is higher than the world average is $10.00 for 10mbps.
To sync 144MB per month vs 288MB, you would need an average of 0.00005555555556/mbps vs 0.00011111111112mbps.
This amounts to $.000056 per block vs $.0001 per block.
This comes out to a difference in cost of $2.92 per year. 
If you actively use bitcoin an average of 1 time every day, your fees will be over $18 vs $3.65 if blocksizes grew and fees were allowed to settle at your earlier acceptable benchmark of $.01.

with a typical 4TB hd. 
Per year, this is $1.503 difference, and the reality is that this is average 4TB hard drive cost.  You could actually do better than this.

I'm saying that since monero has established a precedent of forks being normalized, then the forks will be no big deal even as they grow.  
I suggested that bitcoin incorporate a regularly scheduled fork long ago.  It would be enabled by default and you would have to opt out in order to not fork.  At that point it would be expected that you would be left behind by the network.
This would not have any impact on the level of decentralization.  It would simply be a protocol level upgrade system.

The opinion you won't find often in r bitcoin is that this sub is being controlled such that dissenting opinions are being marginalized.  The alternative reality is that there are a significant number of people out there who believe that on-chain scaling should be prioritized before off-chain alternatives.  Since segwit's primary motivation is to enable off-chain scaling solutions, many people believe that the fact that core developers have prioritized segwit above more direct solutions that focus on on-chain growth, is an indication that the current core leadership has failed to uphold bitcoin as it was intended (a digital cash system).

This would have the direct impact of destroying every politicians future and destroying the country's future.  No existing politician even today has the level of idiocy that would preclude agreeing to default by choice.  Someday we may default, but it will not be by choice, and it will not be any time soon.

The utility for transactions is growing so rapidly that while this week I can't fully live off of bitcoin, it may be possible in another month.  Even if major key companies do not adopt, there are often times ways around them.  An example is that while you can't purchase products on Amazon directly with bitcoin, you can use gyft.com which gives you a 3% return on bitcoin expenditures which effectively gives you a 3% discount as well as access to spending all the bitcoins you want on any of the millions of Amazon products.  You can virtually live off of products from Amazon with the exception of taxes, rent or home payment, and utilities.  Its just a matter of likely small amount of time for those categories.

Once businesses get entirely dependent on bitcoin, we should see stabilization because of market wide pressures. 
As of now the only thing its value is derived from is its limited quantity, as well as the other conveniences it offers for transferring, privacy, and security.  Demand is driving it up now which is related to its limited quantity, but not everyone wants to save money indefinitely.  Eventually economic pressures will force a significant amount of people to use their bitcoin's value elsewhere.  The price will drop then relative to the amount of people who get out of it.  
I think one way a smart company could instantly increase bitcoin sales would be to sell video games / consoles for bitcoin.  Most of the people who have bitcoins are young / tech savvy and I would wager that many of us play video games. But with coins fluctuating in value so quickly, I can see why there is a heavy barrier for big companies to accept them without some kind of insta-conversion to fiat.

The question I would have is not regarding lending.  If coinbase keeps customers funds in cold storage, then they must have a pool that is online which is used for people who decide to transfer their coins to an off site address.  This pool would be a floating number based on if everyone withdrawals or deposits into coinbase.  If everyone decided to withdrawal coins at the same time, that pool would be depleted and coinbase would be forced to activate cold storage coins.  That simply doesn't happen because of the number of people who never withdrawal their coin. 
Also, when people buy coins I see no reason they couldn't be selling coin they don't have.. .  Remember when coinbase ran into a "liquidity crunch?"  Then they suddenly decided to increase the buy limits.  How are these buy limits created, and how do they just arbitrarily increase them?  This should not be possible without access to the actual coin or people selling the coins.  
I have come up with some pretty odd questions between their active pool, their sale limits, their cold storage base, and their clear lack of connection of addresses to private keys.  It almost seems like they have their own internal blockchain for internal storage.  Unless we have access to the records of both their private storage and their second layer "online" storage, it is hard for me to trust that their number are all adding up.  
Of course it doesn't matter to me, I am personally cold storing all coin I buy from coinbase as soon as they release it...  but nothing is really clear to me. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 08:30:17
That would not be possible.  Bitcoin prices would jump sky high after a few hundred thousand were purchased.  The exchanges would run out of coins and shut down as has already happened several times with coinbase.  As the supply decreases the smaller decimal points will be utilized further and further while prices continually increase.  Government could true it, but it would simply cause mass increase in price and they still wouldn't be left with any huge portion of the total coins. 
@_date: 2013-12-31 08:44:39

Lightening is fine as long as it doesn't interfere with bitcoins primary mission to serve as a electronic cash system.  However, it is doing just that since some well invested companies are focusing entirely on it an other layer two (not bitcoin) solutions instead of doing the basic work necessary to allow layer 1 to work properly as it was intended.
Lets do both but do the layer 2 stuff after we fix layer 1.  Then lightening subnets can compete with the main chain and the markets can pick which is best.

Segwit was an is a solution which did not address the problem of scaling.  Segwit's purpose is to fix transaction malleability, to provide a 1 time scaling boost, and to enable other non-bitcoin layers to interact with bitcoin.  
None of these things have anything to do with a permanent scaling solution.  This is why people are mad, and this is why miners won't agree.  They correctly recognized that segwit's primary benefit to bitcoin is to allow non-bitcoin layers to connect to bitcoin, and they have drawn a line in the sand... if bitcoin developers won't provide a actually bitcoin based long term scaling solution, then miners won't accept segwit which does nothing for them.  What is happening is all expected and entirely logical.

That isn't correct at all.  The scaling war exists because the information guardians decided their thoughts were more important than anyone else's and then subsequently alienated a huge chunk of the community to the degree that they are seeking vengeance.  
In addition, I think a large portion of people (including myself) agree that bitcoin shouldn't necessarily hold all the worlds transactions for all of time, but they believe that the only reasonable way to decide which transactions are priced out and in is to let the market fight over it.  No single person's opinion should dictate what is acceptable.  Bitcoin was built on market forces, and this important piece of bitcoin should be no different, even if the outcome is something that Szabo and theymos or anyone else doesn't like.

Buying anything significant locally is just a bad idea unless you know some trusted source, but if you know a trusted source, then you aren't private.  Privacy is a concern that coinbase could actually do something about, but they won't because they want to show carrots to the government rather than sticks.  It is again a business decision, but I prefer the model of only giving necessary information to the government and then making sure that you as a company no longer have any means to retain info on your customers beyond what is absolutely necessary.  Coinbase doesn't do this.

One thing you can do to help; Take your main coin stash off the exchanges. If you use coinbase, withdraw all your coin to a cold storage solution. You taking your coin off the exchanges means you are actively participating in increasing its value. Next time you need to buy something off amazon, use gyft.com and replace the coin you spend with a new purchase of bitcoin at the same time.  
Sometimes it is better to just think about what you can do rather than what is happening around you. There are direct benefits if you just use coin for purchases.  So save some, and use some that you replace at the same time for active stuff.  Keep your shit off the exchanges and enjoy life.

A simple way would be for a government to slowly accumulate a substantial portion of all the existing bitcoins within its area of governance.  Then use the bitcoin as the reserve base for a new currency that would act as as the fractional FIAT second tier money.  In that scenario, tier one money would be the catalyst for transfers between central banks and other government bodies or non government bodies like the FED.  Once the conversion to a secondary alt currency happened, a very similar scenario to what we see today could be created until the cycle started all over again.    
The dynamics of these cycles are likely to change though because things like crowd funded assassination cites have appeared.   Politicians should be weary even now as the corrupt will eventually find it illogical to expose themselves to public office.  The world is changing and there is nothing besides shutting the internet down that the world governments can do about it.

If you send coin using a active address, you can simply use whatever exchange you prefer to buy an equal amount of coin at the exact time you sent the coins for going market rate in FIAT.  Since goods and services are priced at current market value according to the FIAT... when you replace bitcoin as you spend it, the net effect on your bitcoin account and its represented value would be effectively nothing.

The concept of Representative democracy was originally designed to work to protect the public as well as protect private property rights.  Now it has become closer to a public popularity contest won by promising direct benefits to your voting base.  The "most people who are idiots and have no capacity for forward thinking" are the people choosing the leaders.  I don't see how that benefits society either.  Instead, it seems to promote corruption systemically. 
When the country was founded, only those who owned property were allowed to vote, and as a consequence, private property laws in the U.S. were the strongest in the world.  I am not sure how science was funded in the 1800's, but I suspect that with limited government taxation and stronger property rights, companies were able to spend far more on R &amp; D budgets.

I wouldn't say "arbitrary."  The ability to increase the number of digits after the decimal actually gives rise to a permanent deflationary potential.  Conversely, increasing the total coin would immediately create potential for inflation.  Of the two, increasing the total amount would be much more dangerous than increasing the number of post decimal numbers. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 18:43:14
Most of us believe in bitcoin because it offers a vision of a better future where banks and governments can't destroy your earnings with inflation or other arbitrary value manipulating methods.  A mature bitcoin environment brings savings back to practicality and gives incentive to learn about personally taking charge of your own value.  It also means that us geeks have something complex to understand and that keeps us busy creating infrastructure and services around. 
No one who is really into bitcoin thinks of it as solving mundane issues. Maybe some people who don't understand it think of it that way, but the people who really know what it is think of it as a major game changer.  It is anti corruption / anti- Federal reserve / anti - central bank / anti - federal control of our money.  It is also pro - individual responsibility because it forces you to educate yourself if you want to participate and it forces you to take complete control of your own security since there is no one their to look over your shoulder or to reimburse you if you get your stash stolen.

On silk road there was a guy who would accept anonymous transfers via western Union.

It was completely anonymous and 0 fee but his directions were very specific as to how to go about talking to him and the procedure to make sure he knew which money order was associated with which SR account. 
It was fast, free, and 100% anonymous.  It was also moderately protected because the guy doing it was getting rated by SR and was also a dealer who had interest in protecting that rating.  He had a 100% feedback rating with hundreds of transactions.

You are basically right at this point, although there are a lot of methods and techniques that can secure your coin without crazy investment of time.  In general, two factor authentication should be enough.
In the end, you still need to understand what you are getting into especially with large sums of money... but BTC has advantages that are worth investing the time to understand.  Also, as people adopt BTC in larger numbers, security will improve.  If BTC is able to keep its advantages that it currently enjoys, it will never be perfectly secure though.  Just remember that with true freedom comes risk.  Freedom isn't real when there are no consequences.  Just like if you want to store value by buying a house... it can be burned down, or if you store value by buying gold.... it can be stolen;  With bitcoin, you can be anonymous, you can store value that can't be touched by thieves or governments, you can transfer value across the globe for free and outside of the boundaries of taxes and borders of countries.  If you are in China for example you can protect your savings against a perpetual government push to reduce the value of its currency.  But if you aren't informed and aren't following logical security methods, you are likely to get burned.  
This shouldn't be something that keeps you away from BTC.  Be excited that such a technology exists and consider the few days of studying you might have to do to understand it a worthwhile effort to undertake.  
Also, I guarantee you that once you learn how to do it and why you should, you will be able to show your friends in minutes instead of days. The younger generation will grow along with the technology and the future will embrace it.

You are right, but you need to relax.  It isn't happening now.  This is a process that will take many years.  The government doesn't believe it is going to fail any time soon, and because of this belief, they will act as though the boat isn't sinking for the moment.  They will pay the interest on the debt which keeps the ship floating for now as opposed to committing political suicide and going down through history as the ones that destroyed the greatest country in history. 
You have to sit back for a second and realize that the process of destruction will not happen over night.  While that is exactly what happened to the Soviet Union, we are in a different situation.  Our dollar has spread to be used by a huge percentage of the world, and many of those who have signed on to the dollar are heavily invested in keeping its value.  They will fight for it as will the U.S. and the military we have.  The change in balance will take the military being usurped as well as the currency being given up by many throughout the world.  When you see countries and people throughout the world giving up on the dollar in mass is when you should start being immediately concerned.  Until then, rest assured our government will not collapse nor will they "default."  
This is a process that will take many many years and then suddenly it will be instant.  The moment it turns instant should be fairly obvious to those who have decent understandings of world events.

Right now it doesn't matter because 1 satoshi is worthless, but if we get to the point where 1 satoshi represents a significant amount of value, then it does matter.  If we increase the amount of digits, then you give rise to deflation by disconnecting the smallest unit of measurement from a small enough tangible value to be useful.  The limited amount of divisions acts as a cap to deflation.

If the price drops low enough that the coins can be bought cheap, people who believe in bitcoin will simply buy and hold more and more until the price rises again.  The core libertarians / anarchists / black market users / math and cryto geeks are not giving this up regardless of the media's bias.  Eventually, the media will get back on board and the train will keep rolling until the next hick-up when they go negative again.  Shit won't really hit the fan until the dollar starts to enter its dying phase.  Then we will see capital control imposed by government and coordinated propaganda against bitcoin.  They still won't be able to stop it unless they shut down the internet though.  
The only other circumstance that would be devastating would be if the bitcoin community made steps to cozy up to control and regulation which would remove the ability to use it behind the government and banks backs.  Then the core supporters would bail along with the rest of everyone at the next sign of a sell-off.  
The best case scenario would be a true anonymity upgrade like integration of the zerocoin.  Then the core supporters would forever back the currency and no matter how much instability existed, bitcoin's base value would forever grow.

Mining coins is not power efficient for most companies or people right now because the difficulty scales so quickly.  If amazon dedicated their servers to mining, they would be on top for a while and would certainly be making a bunch of money, but even then, the problems they are solving are not so simple that they would be making 100 % or even 50 %  or even 20% of the hashes.  They would probably be getting between 10 and 15 percent%.  Then the difficulty would scale and it would drive them into an even lower return rate.  Their business is making them more than enough money to not chase after the entire worlds computational power on a somewhat random quest.

If the protocol is changed to allow for more decimals, then it is broken.  The limits were set in stone so that people could not manipulate the system.

What happens to markets when the value swings so wildly based on FIAT currency combat that no one can maintain a price point for coins relative to value.

If you go by previous chart action, it will likely go slightly up and down over the course of the next few months.  The previous charts suggest that it will not move more than 20 or 30 percent of its value from its center point. and it will center around 50 to 60 percent of its previous high or so.  
So basically unless something happens that will cause it to deviate from its previous graphical movement (which is pretty likely), it will stay mostly between 600 and 700 and probably get up to 800 or 900 and maybe get down to 400 during this time. 
Of course if one major investment happens it could go up to thousands pretty quickly.  Good luck guessing.  I am waiting a few weeks and hoping to buy coin for below 600 again.  Really all this is cheap now so I would say any price is good to buy at and bad to sell at at the moment.

Wouldn't this also be an opposing force to the deflationary or divisional nature of the currency.  If transaction fees increase, and larger portions of coins are required to get your transactions into the blocks, yet people are unwilling to spend large percentages to transact, this has a downward effect on the value of the coin.  IT could slow the value climb.

The solution to this is very simple.  Someone needs to program into the send functions of the websites and mobile wallets that people use ... a feature that allows you to purchace equal coin to what you just spent at current market value. 
For example on the confirmation screen at coinbase when you send to an external address, add a check-box that when checked will simultaneously issue a buy order for a default of the exact amount of coin you spent, with the option to change that value so you could buy more or less if you wanted.

*how can the government seize coins from SR when not all SR activity was nefarious, and they are not attempting to seize those coins in relationship to a specific crime?

Just sign up and link your bank account to it in the same way you would link a bank account to paypal.  Once you are setup, you can buy and sell coins in seconds.  U.S. dollars take about 3 or 4 days to convert to bitcoin, but coinbase locks in your rate, so if you use the above stategy, you lose nothing.  My strategy is to keep a buffer of coin in coinbase that I use to purchase things, and when I do... I replace them immediately by buying the same amount that I just purchased with plus a little extra.  That way my BTC always grows.

Every time I use a BTC or a portion of one, I just buy the amount I used, at the same time, and I lose no BTC.  I also lose no value because the prices of goods or services fluctuate along with the price of BTC.  To me it is the same as putting cash in the bank to prepare for a debit card purchase.

I object to your points in two ways.  
First, the concept that government agencies been known to lie, manipulate, and commit illegal actions to bring about their ends is not new.  There are many examples of this throughout history. In the case of a modern cyber crime where all existing evidence may come in the form of encrypted data, it may be even easier for them to lie their way into a victory for prosecution.  If certain elements of the prosecutions case were completely made up, it could be virtually impossible to prove otherwise depending on the nature of the encryption and the nature of the infrastructure.  Considering this case's structure and how easily the framework could be manipulated , I don't see how the FBI lying would necessarily create risk of getting caught.  They could very easily control the environment enough that they could make anything reality and there would be no way to prove otherwise.
Second; He has not been proven to have broken the law.  You are operating under an assumption and offering it as the only alternative to your original premise that the FBI would never lie because they wouldn't dare risk it.  This is pretty shaky logic.

Great comment.  My premise was within the context that government or some other force would destroy some large percentage of total coin.  If you took away 70% percent of total coins for example, that would stretch the satoshi over a much greater amount of value.  
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:17:18
I realize that a satoshi is one 10 billionth of a bitcoin, but realistically, how is an entire economy supposed to operated off of a currency where both its largest and its smallest units are capped?  This becomes even more important if the total available bitcoins are reduced.  
Someone could really fuck the market even further by buying bitcoins and then destroying them by deleting the private keys.  Seems like an inherent issue that the federal government could spend a few hundred billion buying up coins and then literally destroying them.  Although they would be unlikely to be able to destroy all of them, they could limit their access so severely that the bottom level units (satoshis) would be worth far to much to carry on basic commerce.  The motivation to do this would be protection of their FIAT systems. 
At minimum there needs to be enough coin where a single satoshi would represent something similar to a penny today... or preferrably a 10th or 100th of a penny.  On the top end that would make each coin worth 10's or 100's of thousands, and there are simply not enough to represent value on the scale our planet requires.
