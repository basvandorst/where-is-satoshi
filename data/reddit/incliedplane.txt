Yes but if you want to buy from the comfort of your own home and buy other altcoins, CoinSpot is the way to go.

Cool thanks for the tip!

High transaction fees, out of Coinbase’s control.

How does your Bitcoin appreciate?

Travel at 0.9999c for a few months, should do the trick.
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:00:16
How do you get such low trans fees to still be profitable?

Would this be the “difficulty” on blockchain.org?
@_date: 2017-11-06 09:46:59
Seems like an astronomical amount now haha.
@_date: 2017-11-06 09:38:13
So in the early days it was basically a treasure trove where you could use low Gh/s hardware to generate massive reward like 50BTC?
@_date: 2017-11-06 11:33:05
Buy more
@_date: 2017-11-06 09:32:57
Ah ok, will that be their point in which coins will not be able to be mined profitably?

0.01BTC. I slap my self I the face now because used to be infatuated with the game Bitcoin Billionaire back in 2014 - little did I know about real bitcoin.

How much is your BTC fortune worth now?
@_date: 2017-11-06 09:44:01
Yes, thankyou to you and the other redditors on educating me :)
@_date: 2017-11-06 09:35:00
Kind of like an asymptote of effectiveness?

Why GPU’s, seems inefficient for the task at hand?
