Unfortunately, nothing in this world is fool proof. A fool can mess up even the most full proof strategy.

When everyone in the business accepts bitcoin, it's huge to be able to say "I was first ".

And if any of these algorithms would be broken, there is much bigger fish to catch than bitcoin. The whole banking system would be vulnerable too.

About 2000 btc, but I am preparing to move it all to brainwallets.

Anyone else thinks its extremely attractive with a woman sincerely interested in bitcoin? Hit a nerve.

Looks pretty cool. I would suggest changing "miners guess the passwords" to something else though. The miners do not guess passwords, and even if you meant this as a simplification I fear it may give people the impression that miners reveal the users' passwords.
Also, I found the analogy of blocks as harddrives a bit off and somewhat confusing. My suggestion for the analogy: Links in a chain. Miners weld the links together to form the blockchain, each dependent on the previous link and all earlier links in existence. 
EDIT: Added missing words "as harddrives"

If I understand correctly, this would be a good application for "colored coins". It's a super cool concept, but still not a reality.

Early, but not early early. Got in at June 2011. Bought a chunk then at $28, but then a bigger chunk at $2, at the bottom :)
