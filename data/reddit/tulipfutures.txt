Oh, hell, I feel bad:


Go to a goddamn college. You shouldn't be asking questions like this. 3600 bitcoins being mined every day despite the price crashing and interest waning isn't a good thing. It doesn't matter if they're sold or not, just like it doesn't matter if fed dollars are spent or not. The printing presses should stop when demand drops (real demand not miner demand you moron) until interest picks back up...but for the next 100 years or whatever Bitcoin will be *inflationary*.

Concisely as I can put it, all cryptos function the same. If I need to send a money substitute for $100 USD to my cousin in Nigeria, it is utterly irrelevant whether I send 100 rocks or 1 rock or 10 Litecoins or 1,000,000 Litecoins or 10 Dogecoins or 1 BTC. As long as the substitute can be returned to functional currency (USD here) it doesn't matter how many units are transferred or the value per unit. Sending Dogecoins is the same as sending Bitcoins. 
Now, Bitcoin hopes to derive value from scarcity. Our cryptos are scarce, yours aren't, therefore ours are more valuable. That's crazy, from a rational perspective data is not scarce and cryptocoins are not necessarily limited. That's an additional "feature" to Bitcoins in order to obtain deflation, not a necessity for the function of the coins. 
The price per BTC is totally irrelevant. Scarcity is artificial. Bitcoins aren't scarce, only bitcoins are. Expecting ever-increasing gains for artificial scarce data is a little crazy if you ask me, but somehow people were convinced to pay $1200 for each unit at one time, and most people here (based on that recent reddit survey) think the units are worth $2000 at least. 
Tigerdirect doesn't care how many units of paymentcoin they get, so long as someone can convert paymentcoin to the USD equivalent for their goods. The idea that this scarce data is somehow valuable is one of the most fascinating phenomena I've ever seen

@_date: 2014-03-20 23:10:20


These are very unrealistic expectations. If you buy bitcoins, you should only buy them as a way to use them in the bitcoin economy in a way you can't use cash (thus purchasing them for utility) or because you can convince a merchant to give you a BTC discount. Do not buy bitcoins as in investment, they aren't an investment. 
The price rose to $1000+ based on hysterical mania. There's no reason for it to climb back up to $1000, and no real reason for it to stay as high as $600. The price is trending downwards. It's more likely, in my opinion, that within a year you'd be more likely to lose half your money than double it.

Does this sound like the way people traditionally spend money? It's a terrible system and I think merchant feedback and a comparison to Dogecoin is pretty good proof of that. 
Also, if someone has a bunch of coins from &gt; $1 they don't want to spend them and then re-buy at the "inflated" current market rate. They'd much rather hold on to their &gt;$1 BTC until they grow much larger. In practice, very few people are willing to spend or spend and then rebuy. Volume is in the toilet exactly because of the way Bitcoins are designed. 
Think of it this way - If, somehow, it were announced that Bitcoins were no longer limited, the holders would all sell. Bitcoins would still function the same, but you wouldn't have the ponzi-esque "get rich by doing nothing" side of Bitcoin that exists now. Holders don't care about the functionality of the network, they care about making money for contributing absolutely nothing to society.

Use your brain for a second here - bitcoin's aren't limited. Supply and demand only matters if your product is limited, or you have no competition. Demand for bitcoins won't increase the price of bitcoin when Litecoins and Dogecoins do the *exact same thing* for less money. 
You're naive to see the world in such black-and-white. Someone told you bitcoins were limited? And you didn't bother to think for a half a minute that this "limitation" carries absolutely no additional value because the technology isn't proprietary. 
Where's your common sense? 
@_date: 2014-04-15 20:06:53


For many merchants, this level is "any number of bitcoins". There are other answers to your question, but price volatility is a big enough issue for most merchants that they don't want to risk holding for even a minute. What's the point in accepting bitcoin if you aren't really accepting it? That doesn't really speak to the virtues of this amazing new technology, they may as well use an internal AmazonCoin to accomplish the same thing (and in fact mentioned they may do just that recently)


And, believe it or not, for some people this time is simply not worth it. If accepting bitcoin via BitPay has literally no downsides for Amazon, why haven't they done it yet? Perhaps it's because Bitcoin barely made a difference for Overstock, $10-25,000 in sales per day is absolute peanuts for a giant like Amazon, and they pay a credit card rate of roughly 1.15% so Bitcoin is not only more cumbersome for customers to buy and use, but also barely less expensive than credit card options consumers are already familiar with

I see your point, you see Bitcoin as The Coin and any others as an altcoin, but you fail to recognize that any altcoin can come along and essentially blow bitcoin out of the water regardless of how much Venture Capital has been promoting bitcoin. It's essentially been promoting cryptocurrency in general. 
I'm sure most of the smart money in Bitcoin is ready to drop it like a sack of potatoes the minute they realize a true useable cryptocurrency for world commerce. Bitcoin isn't it, and most adopters don't want to even acknowledge that as a possibility, even if it came from a bank and was backed by governments and pegged to something rather than wildly volatile and artificially valued

And where did I do that? I've been talking about transactions. 


And desirability is a direct function of utility. You're way too black-and-white in your viewpoints. 


I think you need to understand the hard lesson that Bitcoin isn't economics 101. Bitcoin has a limited supply therefore the price will be infinite, right?! Consumer transactions and the ability to transact is what drives adoption and creates demand. Indeed, this is econ 101 stuff, but you're again looking at this in a far too black-and-white fashion when realistically there are dozens of factors affecting Bitcoin desirability and demand


Yes, it does. -blank stare-


Another completely useless analogy. I'm not talking about trading three or four different commodities once, we're talking about buying and spending your bitcoins at a variety of stores vs. buying them and doing absolutely nothing with them. In the former case you're creating utility and merchant demand, in the latter you aren't accomplishing anything. 


This is just hilariously and laughably wrong. So, so incorrect I don't even know how to begin attempting to correct your terrible opinions on the matter. 
If Satoshi held all of his bitcoins and never told anybody about them you really think they'd be as valuable? They're a lot more scarce, why wouldn't they be worth billions just sitting on his hard drive unused? 
I don't know how somebody could be so wrong and misunderstand economics so badly. 


I don't disagree that merchants not really accepting BTC is a problem, but I do know that if they never started accepting them in the first place they wouldn't be valued anywhere nearly as highly as they are today. Again, if satoshi just mined himself and didn't tell anybody and couldn't spend them on Newegg you think they'd be more valuable because scarcity = value in your black and white world, right?


This is insanely ironic. 


You haven't presented a single point worth addressing. Spending = bad, scarcity = good and bitcoins would be worth a ton more if nobody knew about them or spent them, genius!


I've backed up every statement I've made with real-world examples. Your statements have all been vague and half-hearted and full of "okay but if you just look at it my way" nonsense about how transactions aren't important. If you consider yourself knowledgeable about basic economic principles I think you need to reevaluate that because again you've got some insanely wrong ideas about what is good for an economy.

There's obvious benefits, but the fact that bitcoiners allow off-chain transactions shows that it means very little to bitcoiners. What good is your public ledger if you can't see exactly where each and every stolen Gox coin is? 
Legacy banking works in a way that they can, in fact, see each and every transaction into and out of someone's account (barring ridiculous stuff like shipping $6B in cash). The legacy banking system is far more capable of auditing itself than the various Bitcoin exchanges and businesses doing off-chain transactions.

No, it isn't. 
There's a multiple-crypto ATM. All the support and money behind supporting ATMs simultaneously supports ATM for all cryptos. The exact same thing applies to POS units. If I encouraged some business owner to get a POS unit for Bitcoin and in a year SomeOtherCoin is the main coin, they can easily change the software to suit SomeOtherCoin. 
Look, you clearly don't understand what I'm trying to say. I've explained it in simple English like four times now and you still have the nerve to post this stupid "nope empirically false" bullshit. How is it false? A recent UK merchant survey said roughly 50% of bitcoin accepting merchants already do or soon will be willing to accept Alts. All the talking-into people did to get those retailers to accept Bitcoins wasn't *just* for Bitcoin, the same benefits would apply to the Cryptocoin-of-the-day, since they function the same. 
If Finnish (or whatever) retailers were talking into installing Bitcoin ATMs, you don't think there's now a demand for an Auroracoin option at those ATMs? Literally every avenue paved by Bitcoin marketing/lobbying is open to every other crypto, whether you think they are particularly valuable or not.

You'll never see a $2000 bitcoin, the momentum was completely lost for Bitcoin when Gox happened and now it's a matter of expecting people to pay 200% of today's price, call that a good deal, and ignore the massive issues already plaguing this particular cryptocurrency. $1200 was the moon, and bitcoin will go down in history as both a niche payments service and the modern day tulip mania, with a side of lunatic libertarian fantasies.

Your comparison is even more dumb, because you seem to think cryptocurrencies are scarce when only "bitcoin" has a set number. Very similarly to tulip bulbs, you're trying to sell an artificial scarcity. Cryptocoins are as infinite as computers and electricity.

@_date: 2014-03-02 23:02:38


You can rest assured this is the case. Look at it in this very simple way:
Bitcoins aren't rare or limited. Bitcoin is, but that's fine and doesn't mean anybody should overpay for Bitcoins when EveryOtherCoin isn't full of people who want it to be a "get-rich-quick" scheme. 
Most of a cryptos value is derived from its function, and BTC functions the exact same way as any other crypto, so no inherent value there
The remainder would be from scarcity, the idea that Bitcoins are limited and you'd better get them now because once everybody has some the price for each will rise. Except this, of course, is bullshit. There's a limit on bitcoins but that's no reason people can't adopt another coin just as easily. The infrastructure needed is already in place, thanks to Bitcoin. 
There's literally no reason for a price increase other than people wanting to believe their artificially limited crypto is any more valuable than another just because it was first (and in spite of the tremendous amount of bad news)
edit: I just want to add that it's even more funny if people still want to claim that Bitcoin scarcity should affect value, considering 6% of ALL of them are (maybe) lost with Gox and there's been at least another 4% of the total supply stolen in other attacks. oh, and Satoshi owns a cool million, but that's okay because, uhh?

Thanks. You don't have to be so smug. 
The price on the day of those hearings appears to be $618. That's up more than 300% from ~45 days before (~$150 on Oct 1st). Two days later, the price was down $50 (~$560).
The numbers still seem to indicate that the rise started well before even that hearing, and that the hearing itself may have contributed to a 10% drop in the two days following.

Ahahahaha. No. That's an astoundingly stupid statement. You're wrong Bruce. Have you read the Gox terms of service?

Company assets do not belong to their customers.

Why don't you fucking read the ToS of basically ANY major exchange? They all have EXTREMELY LIMITED liability, several specifically including losses through negligence.

For what it's worth, neither of those are really "using BTC". Gyft will take your bitcoins, sell them to somebody else, make their "cut" and then give you a fiat-denominated gift card. To the store accepting the card, this is a fiat purchase. 
Overstock, similarly, doesn't directly accept bitcoins. BitPay takes bitcoins, sells them to other bitcoiners, makes their "cut" and pays for the goods in Fiat. 
I would recommend you spend your BTC at a merchant that directly accepts BTC. Any other expenditure isn't really supportive of the BTC infrastructure.

Where do you think that money would come from? Across the board people will be lucky to recover 5% of their holdings, your figures are extremely unrealistic considering the circumstances and typical progress of a liquidation. 
Though I doubt a court would ever burden themselves of this research, but it makes sense that people who actually only invested a couple hundred (early adopters) should be less-compensated than recent adopters foolish enough to purchase at or around $900. If one person paid $1 each for 1000 Bitcoins and one person paid $900 each for 1000 Bitcoins their compensation shouldn't be anywhere near the same.

Okay...bitcoin isn't a commodity. It's data. You can literally copy it exactly. It's not proprietary or patented. It's a currency, the value of which should be relatively stable. Read the fucking white paper, bitcoin wasn't about rewarding early adopters with the wealth of the world, it was about low-cost no middleman money transfer. The greed of speculators has bastardized this simple concept. The price per bitcoin isn't especially important, it was a big con to convince people that not only was it important, but also that $1000 or $800 or even $600 is a "good deal" for non-proprietary data that can and has already been copied/imitated

Why was your entire response a quote?
When people are victims of fraud, their bank account fees don't raise. Neither do other people using the bank. It seems like you don't even understand how the traditional system works. Yes, everybody is paying a monthly fee for the protections provided, but they don't pay more when they actually use it. I have so much money in the bank I don't even pay fees, and if money is lost I'll still continue to pay 0 fees. Banks don't pass on post-fraud costs, they collect fees before anything happens to make sure they can handle losses. 
Alternatively, they can pay nothing and "secure" their own money, with no recourse when its lost. That's Bitcoin. 


Again, your example is flawed because even if Person A-E ALL were victims of fraud, their bank account fees wouldn't increase and they wouldn't have lost a single penny. There's no increases "hidden from them", there's simply no increases period. The Bank's insurer would be SOL, except their whole business model is based on collecting fees to absorb these risks.

I think you're missing the point. 
An exchange "losing" BTC **isn't** theft. It's very easy for an exchange to claim they were hacked, you can't prove they own the address that holds all the BTC, thus you can't prove they committed theft. I'll repeat the same question I asked and hope you're willing to research an answer :
What crime exactly did they commit? Theft of Cryptocurrency? Loss of uninsured, unregulated internet FunMoney? 
They have 0 obligation to safeguard or protect money. None. Nada. Yes, this is "bad for business", but so long as they aren't criminally liable then who cares? Fact is they can quite easily rip off their customers and not get in trouble for it. 
You're right that the problem isn't fundamental to bitcoin, but in the "real" finance world there's a ton of regulation making sure that exchanges have capital to insure losses and are doing everything they can to protect investor funds. THERE IS NO SUCH REGULATION IN BITCOIN, AND THUS NO CONSUMER PROTECTION IF AN EXCHANGE "LOSES" YOUR MONEY TO A "HACKER". This **is** a problem unique to BTC that doesn't equally apply to Fiat.

You can't have lower prices and then charge more for using a CC either, that's against most CC policies and you're dreaming if you think most merchants will drop their CC companies for the tiny amount of bitcoin users.
See, this is why I said you don't know anything about business
@_date: 2014-12-28 20:03:14
Your premise is really ridiculous though. Bitcoin *hasn't* caught on in the mainstream and by now a lot of people are familiar with it. Consumer adoption should still be the main goal of any bitcoiner, and consumers aren't going to adopt it based on other people doing nothing with it
I'm paraphrasing another redditor from earlier today, but "an economy without transactions is ultimately valueless", that is if everybody were to follow your instructions and hold then sales at Overstock, Newegg, etc would dry up and they might entirely remove the payment option. Bitcoins only have any significant value *because* of their purchasing power at actual notable retailers. 
Some holding may be necessary but I assure you the spenders are more important to your economy thriving than a bunch of people holding coins and showing how useful they are by not using them at all.

Understandable. You'd still want that protection for the vast majority of the rest of your commerce, just like the rest of the world does.

I guess I was talking about a hard fork where one fork is "Bitcoin" and the other is basically the discarded fork...in this case your less-centralized Bitcoin would be the discarded fork and the Bitcoin we use today would continue to run on, but you were assuming the opposite. 


Fair, but OP asked about centralization. You can't shop at Dell or Newegg without a third-party, they simply won't accept them. There's a topic in r/bitcoin now gathering the stores that actual only accept BTC and don't convert and there was maybe a dozen absolutely tiny merchants there. The spending Bitcoin economy *is* reliant on a third party for survival


I don't think this is really accurate
@_date: 2014-03-03 18:58:27


No, it's foolish to think that it will. 99.999% of the world's population doesn't care about or is scared of Bitcoin. That isn't going to substantially change. Consumers need regulation, insurance, compensation. With any/all of those things implemented, bitcoin no longer becomes "low-fee" or anywhere near "instant".
As Bitcoin adapts to better accommodate consumers who prefer modern banking, it loses the efficiency that allows for low-cost transfers.

I don't think you even understand by point. All alts are equally divisible, that doesn't mean anything for Bitcoin. Re-read the post you responded to over and over until you get it, thanks. 
I'll expand a little for you: RC Cola wants to sell 591ml bottles for $7000, and they're certain no competitor will ever arise. Pepsi and Coke both come along, selling 591ml bottles for $2. Bitcoiners (like you) literally believe Pepsi will never make it big simply because RC cola was first and has all the logistics already.

Allow me to un-sell you and turn you into, at the very least, a reasonable skeptic. Read with an open mind, indulge me. 


100% agree with you, though I think you're exaggerating the money saved. I'm sure Amazon, for example, pays nowhere near 3.5% based on sheer volume. I did research it a while ago and I think I read that it was 1.5%. It's logical that large-volume sellers get a discount, but you're probably right about mom-and-pop.com paying 3.5% Bitcoin might save .5-2.5%, but the users are paying a merchant fee and also paying exchange fees. 


No, it isn't. be honest with yourself. For buying a chocolate bar at your local store (if you weren't already using cash) bitcoin is okay, but if Amazon picked it up overnight transactions would take literally hours to confirm. You're aware it can only handle 7 transactions per second, right?


That's *a lot* of ifs. 


Why? Are bitcoins any better are being bitcoins? Any new features? Any new security features for consumers? And bitcoin banks, or lending institutions? If you're going to argue that they should rise because of scarcity, why not buy less expensive, less scarce coins? If merchant save money accepting bitcoins, they can save money accepting othercoins just as easily. There's no proprietary feature, no special magic ingredient. 
@_date: 2014-02-09 19:58:00
How can you claim this? What if a coin comes out literally from the IRS that is custom-built to handle tax returns? With chargebacks and consumer protection that's already widely available from credit services. How about one that actually makes loans feasible? I can see dozens of ways in which other coins could improve upon BTC and specifically avoid those hurdles and embrace the regulation that's pending anyway
@_date: 2014-03-18 19:37:05
You've got the gist of it. The most applicable, real-world use cases for bitcoins are microtransactions and "value transfer" for unbanked individuals in Africa, etc. Neither of these necessitate a high per-coin price, and thus there's no reason for Bitcoins to cost $10,000 in order for them to accomplish their niche uses outside of the trusted and majority-used traditional banking system
@_date: 2014-03-01 18:10:32
There are US exchanges, whether they have been around for a while or not is totally irrelevant. You simply can't blame the regulators of an industry that Bitcoin aims to operate *around* when things don't work out.

We won't see $600 again this year, the mania is over. Bitcoins "worth" $1200 was an absolute joke and the price is just going to spiral downward as people realize the actual utility value of Bitcoins at something like $50-$150 per coin, if that. Roughly 3600 bitcoins are being produced every day whether there's a demand for them or not
This sub was polled fairly early this year and the majority believed we'd see BTC between $1000 and $2000 at the end of the year. I can't imagine anybody still thinks that's realistic, but there's still delusional people around here hoping to get rich for contributing nothing.

For the same reason you keep your money in the bank or in cash and not in loose change or Dave &amp; Busters money. If you want to use BTC to pay your rent or buy groceries, you likely have to cash out at an exchange. People are lazy, it makes sense to keep your money in the most convenient place for you. At an exchange, you can transfer to cash or spend. From a private wallet, you still have to transfer to an exchange to cash out.

I've made this exact same point about 1000x increase in a year (or so). I don't see why bitcoins went so quickly from $1 to $1000, they aren't scarce or any more functional, plus competition has emerged. I don't think any of the hysteria is sustainable and it's still going to drop considerably. 
@_date: 2014-02-09 05:12:48
No mystery there. People who own bitcoin have a vested interest in shielding it from criticisms and promoting puff pieces, encouraging other people to "invest" into the scheme if only to prop up their own "wealth" (lol)
The guy at the NYS DoF meetings had it right, Bitcoins work the same whether they are $1 or $1000, the inflated price is not sustainable and all these posts talking about stability and how bitcoin is a "real currency" because it hasn't crashed completely are really funny
@_date: 2014-04-06 14:51:01
Bitcoin is supposed to save businesses money. You don't immediately give away those savings, nor do you give half of it away after you set up a cumbersome new payment method and pay to train your employees to use it. 
Oh, and credit card providers are likely to threaten businesses who provide incentive to use other non-cash payment methods. It isn't worth giving a 1% discount to bitcoin payers when Visa and MC both pull their services and you go out of business.

Chinese involvement. Coincidentally, Chinese exchanges have begun to close after the People's Bank of China started to strictly regulate the flow of Chinese Yen to Bitcoin. 
Put 2+2 together there and now is a terrible time to invest. Wait a few days/weeks until all the Chinese exchanges have closed and the price has really bottomed out. It still won't be a good investment, but you'll at least lose less money than if you buy now.

If I have to entertain the hypothetical that they are for some reason forced to use a coin they would make their own, but of course they will continue to use the same systems and just lower fees if Bitcoin ever did manage to become any kind of threat to them. 
If Bitcoin is such a revolutionary and efficient technology I don't know why you would call it "beyond retarded" for a company to use it on their back-end to save fees, but hey those are your words not mine.

@_date: 2014-03-03 00:58:01


1. Set up a Wuala account, or other cloud backup service of your choice.
2. Create a strong and unique password offline (manually). This password should be at least 20 characters long; it should contain numbers, upper and lower case letters, and symbols. It should be as random as possible, ie it should look something like this: Zr%8qL03&amp;cvwS9 Never use this password elsewhere.
3. Do not forget this password. Recite it several times a day. It is easy to overestimate your ability to remember a password several months in the future. To be on the safe side, write it down and store the piece of paper in a safety deposit box.
4. Download Bitcoin Linux binary and save it on a USB drive.
5. Shut down your computer, and boot Ubuntu (or Linux distribution of you choice) from a liveCD. This will not affect your current operating system.
6. Disconnect machine from the internet. Unplug any network cables and disable wireless. Verify that wireless is disabled in the icon on the upper right corner (Ubuntu). Double check that machine is disconnected by opening the web browser.
7. Run bitcoin while disconnected to the internet. The client will show 0 connections and 0 blocks, but it will still generate a wallet.dat file and a bitcoin address.
8. Encrypt your wallet using the strong and unique password from step 2 above. (Bitcoin Client &gt; Settings &gt; Encrypt wallet)
9. Copy wallet.dat (found in hidden folder .bitcoin in your home directory) to USB drive.
10. Save bitcoin address to a text file and copy it to USB drive.
11. Shut down system and turn off computer. Before switching your computer on again, remove all power sources for about 1 minute. Physically remove battery from laptop.
12. Backup encrypted wallet.dat file in several places:
        Send it to your 5 best friends by email attachment and ask them to save it for you.
        Save it on your Wuala account created in step 1.
        Save it on several USB drives and CDs and store them in different geographic locations. 
13. Send bitcoins to the address saved on the USB drive. Double check in the block explorer that they have been sent. 
How to retrieve funds
1. Boot from Ubuntu liveCD, as in step 5 above.
2. Insert USB drive.
3. Run bitcoin client and close it again.
4. Replace wallet.dat in ~/.bitcoin directory with wallet.dat from USB drive.
5. Connect to the internet.
6.  Restart bitcoin client.
7. Wait for blocks to download (optional).
8. Send bitcoins. 
^ that's what you call *simple*? If you can explain it in less steps rather than linking me to google like an asshole, go right ahead. I think my point stands that storing bitcoin safely isn't anywhere near simple

haha, really? 


People are greedy, but also fairly skeptical. Bitcoin sounds like a scam to most people* and one previous hysterical gain is no guarantee of another. In fact, bringing any logic into the question of the "real value" of a Bitcoin will seriously decrease the value. The demand for bitcoins isn't $500 * 21 M. Not even close. The utility value isn't anything near that either, most people would ask a high price simply because it cost so much electricity to mine, not because the function of a cryptocurrency necessitates a high price. 
People balk at these nonsensical "another 10x" claims because they are unrealistic. 
@_date: 2014-04-02 20:48:52
Not at all? All cryptocurrencies haven't been victim to bad news stories like Gox and Silk Road to damage their reputation. When people hear bad news about Bitcoins, they hear it about bitcoin and not Litecoin or Dogecoin. In fact, if they hear about any other coin, it's most likely been about Dogecoin sponsoring olympic teams and sponsoring a NASCAR compared to Bitcoin losing millions of investor dollars and half it's value in a quarter of a year

You can't buy a Tesla with bitcoins either, pal. You can find a company to sell your BTC to other people, pay for the tesla in FIAT CASH, and take a cut. 
Find me a single car dealer in the US that will directly accept bitcoins, you'll have as much luck as you would trying to find one that directly accepts Peercoin or whatever. That doesn't change the fact that all cryptocurrencies function the same. If bitcoin never existed and Litecoin took its place you could accomplish the exact same things. It's inarguable that they are the same. 
I never said "supply and demand have no effect on liquidity". I said bitcoins for $1000 was never a result of supply or demand, it was pure speculative mania. A price down 60% from the all time high is essentially proof of that. I think you should save the "dismissed" condescending bullshit for when you actually make a valid point, this certainly isn't one.

You didn't read that properly. Here's the quote for all to see:


This doesn't mean that "bit" is merely descriptive (which doesn't even mean generic) of Bitcoins, it means that "bit trade" quite clearly describes that you're trading Bitcoins. This isn't a ruling on whether or not Bitcoins are a generic term, nor is it a ruling that "Bit" refers to "bitcoins" everywhere in the world, only that it refers to "bit coins" within your application. Also note your application was **declined**

that's one hell of a logical fallacy. you're assuming bitcoins alone and not any other crypto needs to handle the whole world's commerce, or that because bitcoins are artificially limited versus other cryptocoins that we must respect that limit with a higher valuation per coin instead of just using a less-limited crypto with a lower price per coin? 
Like, you're literally just counting on people paying more and more for bitcoins because bitcoin owners say they are so important and you shouldn't use other cryptos even though they work the same and other cryptos aren't 10% owned by thieves

Is it still a 300% gain for all those people connived into buying "cheap" bitcoins for $900, or $800, or $700? 
It's a huge profit (still) for the early adopters. Anybody who bought BTC this year has lost money (on that BTC). Your shilling "still way up from the start" doesn't mean anything to all the people who were bilked into paying more than $500 per BTC and have started to realize a loss on paper.

That's right...and the fundamental technology of cryptocurrencies doesn't necessitate a high price. Did you notice bitcoins are working the exact same whether you paid $2 for them or $1200?

I can't argue with that, but it's just unlikely to happen. When you make it so easy to take money from people without repercussions, it's going to happen.

...yes, it does. Of course some small percentage of coins are being spent, but most of them are simple being held. Let's get back on topic: This is exactly why coins are being considered property. I don't care that you spend some and I don't care that you mention they are being spent, it is utterly irrelevant to the topic at hand. Bitcoins are being hoarded more than they are being spent. That's a fact. It's only right that such a commodity be treated like property and not a currency. If "you guys" don't want to spend it then you won't get the tax treatments as if you were. 


Oh no? Here's a clue:


I don't have any "shorts" on Bitcoin, but you're so quick to assume I must.

Also, you don't have appreciation or depreciation on WoW gold or MS points. It's a ridiculous comparison.

Next year, in 5 years, in 10 years, and most likely forever, house transfers and car transfers and every other large purchase or legal endeavor will be completed by lawyers on legal paperwork, not "on the blockchain" because 0.001% of the world thinks it's a neat technology.

Here look what I tracked down you disingenuous idiot:


submitted 18 days ago by ItsMillerIndexTime
A friend of mine owns a brick and mortar business that accepts BitPay. Today a customer purchased $16 worth of goods, BitPay displayed "this transaction has been paid," and the customer took their purchase and left. An hour later an email from BitPay came saying the transaction was invalid. It seems 'invalid' just means no confirmations after an hour. Presumably no transaction fee was included as it has been over five hours now with no confirmations.
Does this mean I can go around spending zero fee transactions at various businesses and hope to get some of my money back from the transactions that never confirm? What prevents this? I kind of assumed BitPay and other payment processors wouldn't accept zero fee transactions for this reason.

Oh boy. Allow me to quote your own words


This applies to you each and every time you buy a Bitcoin. 


That Cost Per Transaction is a rough premium you're paying every time you buy bitcoins that's essentially going towards the miners. It's a fee you don't see directly but are paying. You're much higher than $50 in fees than you realize


Nobody cares what you believe. It's entirely common for adults with good banks to not have any fees. I don't pay any fees, not for my chequing account and not for my credit card. I get rewards on my CC and my bank pays me more in interest than I "lose" from deflation anyway. You don't even have a point here, you're just saying "nuh uh" because you're an immature, disingenuous shill


low-cost, trustless transactions are the very reason bitcoin exists you tool. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 21:09:11
I'm new to BTC and didn't even know this was a problem. So you have to send ALL your BTC, even if the transaction was just for half of it, and you can't do anything with the change (a.k.a your money) until the transaction for ANY amount of it clears? 
vamper is right, that's a big-time issue

You're laughably wrong about this. The percentage of people on earth who have "faith" in Bitcoins "value" is microscopically small. Scarcity of a resource plays a large part of supply and demand, but not if that scarcity is just made up.

So best case scenario Amazon does 10% of their business in BTC. This is still no reason to let go of Visa/Mastercard


Assuming they have 1% to .1% of their business in BTC, letting go of credit cards/paypal would be sacrificing 99-99.9% of their business. You can assume it would be higher, but regardless it isn't enough to surpass their CC business. 


This is what we're talking about. There's no way in this world that Bitcoin business would be enough for Amazon to drop their CC companies. Amazon is likely looking at Overstock, seeing what a total dud BTC has been for them, and just sticking with doing 100% of their business in fiat. Cryptocurrencies haven't done a damn thing for Overstock
You can't really call my figures "out by a factor of 10" based on some speculation that Amazon would allow worldwide BTC sales. My figures are based on data provided by the overstock CEO, and unlike yourself I won't jump to the conclusion that things would be so much better for Amazon

2 days ago a British merchant survey was posted and 50% either already accepted alts or planned to. Competition is right around the corner 


I have no need for cryptocurrencies, and own no coins. 


Literally only to Bitcoin owners. The general public sees no value in Bitcoins or the network, as evidenced by the abysmal adoption rate for "the future of money"




Gold has real-world natural scarcity, bitcoin aims to emulate this with an artificial scarcity. Nobody should (or will) lend credibility/value to artificial scarcity. The only exception I can think of is diamonds. Good luck!


Most people are, and still will


Value has nothing to do with function. Litecoin functions the same and has a lower value, Dogecoins the same. 


Same applies to bitcoin, and don't kid yourself that bitcoin is "the one that will stabilize/take over" because, as I hope I'm proving, Bitcoin has no guarantee of success. This is, in fact, why Overstock and TD accept via Bitpay. Of the notable merchants "accepting" Bitcoin, very few directly accept it. Overstock might take rocks if I agree to pay them in USD for the rocks people send them

You're being disingenuous, or maybe are just misinformed. I tried to do the math in this thread:
but others stated my numbers are a bit off. 
Here's a choice quote:


Using the published numbers for the gridseed and an electricity price of USD .12 per kwH, I get $14.4 per transaction electricity cost. So i take it that the reward needs to be greater than that figure.
Reward per txn is 35.3 USD per txn, so profit appears to be 21 USD per txn at current exchange rate.
Transaction fees are nowhere fucking near 6 cents.

You think any of those links add up to data? Those are all unique cases, one-off sales. Have you ever looked at transaction volume? I think it's cute you spout off useless anecdotes about one guy buying a Lambo and consider that enough to prove that everybody will spend their BTC on frivolous items despite any volume chart proving your dead wrong. I'm sure Lambo can stay in business with that one BTC sale, same for Range Rover and Tesla. Clearly people are spending enough BTC that the businesses can be supported by these individual purchases, right?
I said people don't spend BTC en masse, you can consult a Volume chart for proof. Your argument against that was "but this guy bought a Lambo! and another guy bought a Tesla!" but that doesn't mean shit and it's hilarious that you thought that was sufficient to prove your idiotic "claim"

I think the idea is to follow pending regulations rather than have some kind of "pure" blockchain. In any event, there's a relatively small number of people attached to bitcoin, and other alts benefit from the same infrastructure (POS terminals, ATMs, etc). It's fairly easy to abandon Bitcoin simply because it's so plagued with scammers that 1/10 is theft and use another Alt when the day comes that one is capable of surpassing bitcoin

I'm very familiar with economics, I don't need a lesson in supply and demand from some idiot shill on a throwaway account. It would benefit you to realize the price of bitcoins has fuck all to do with supply and demand. Nobody demanded a $1000 bitcoin, they stupidly paid as much assuming some idiot would pay even more.

It's very simple: You guys called it "digital currency", so they used that term. You guys treat it like property, so they tax it accordingly.

Amazon pays less than 1% credit card fees because they have such high volume. BitPay would charge them 1%...am I still blowing your mind here? Are you "willfully ignorant"? In some circumstances credit cards are cheaper than Bitcoins, it's hard to swallow I know. 


This reads like broken english. Why mention that "getting a CC system is work"? Almost all of American commerce is done on this payment system nowadays, there's no retailer who wouldn't want to get a credit card system. That's part of being a competitive retailer. All of those hoops you talk about are absolutely worth it for fiat/credit card payment systems...for a .1% increase in business from Bitcoin the worthiness is questionable. The bitcoin network isn't anywhere near flawless, and the increased customer service training may even outweigh the benefits. 
Amazon doesn't pay a monthly/yearly fee, customers may, but they typically get reward points or cash back or simply don't pay a fee. I personally don't pay a fee, and haven't paid a penny in interest this year. And I don't have to attach a six cent miner's fee to every transaction I make.

First, this is a repost
Second, it contains false information


Mastercard, shortly after this announcement denied having any partnership with Xapo and denied having any interest in developing one. 
This bitcoin debit card would be a great idea...if it was actually possible. It's a sad pipe dream now. 
Here's the proof:


The company added: “MasterCard does not have a relationship with Xapo. There is no card program currently available.”
UPDATE (25th April 02:30 BST): Xapo CEO Wences Casares spoke to CoinDesk to clarify the situation, stating that the company is currently working with an undisclosed bank to launch the open-loop debit card product, but it has yet to select a credit card network with which to power the offering. *However, it was originally planning to use the MasterCard network.*
edit: I should add that it actually is a pretty terrible idea anyway. Merchants pay the same CC fees bitcoin was supposed to save them, so not only does this bitcoin debit card not exist, it wouldn't be promoting any of the benefits of Bitcoin if it did.

Do you think message boards are solely for discussing positive aspects of things? I'm interested in Bitcoin, MuForceShoelace clearly is too. Neither of us are biased towards bitcoin specifically and thus we are more easily able to recognize legitimate issues.
This isn't a "pro-bitcoin" sub. It's a bitcoin sub, for discussion of both positive aspects and negative concerns. People like Mu add more to the discussion than the hundreds of mindless yes-men here who downvote anything remotely critical (however valid) and complain about "trolls" who disagree with them. 
This place is fucking pathetic, and threads like this contribute to that. You people should aspire to gain a better understanding of the issues facing bitcoin, not aspire for a mindless praise-only hugbox for true believers. That's not discussion, that's not debate, that's a cult.

Why does it bother you so much that I post here? Should every topic in the world be a hugbox where nobody speaks ill of NASCAR/Xbox/Apple/Whatever? 
As for your question about "better than Bitcoin", I don't know. In terms of efficiency, wealth disparity, and "likeableness of userbase" I would say LiteCoin and Dogecoin are both "better" than bitcoin already. bitcoin is owned 10% by scammers and expects early adopters to gain continual wealth via new adopters, that sounds stupid to me. I don't think any hard-limit cryptocurrency will work. Deflationary economies simply aren't functional in practice. 
Realistically I think Bitcoin might have niche uses for microtransactions or lower-cost "value transfer" but most people will continue to use modern banking infrastructure and "bitcoin" may not be suitable to service the aforementioned niche uses anyway
@_date: 2014-03-27 17:24:05

They don't have to stop using it. All cryptocurrencies work the same, any Bitcoin ATM can be made to accept Litecoin or AnyOtherCoin, and any merchant accepting BTC will already be familiar with accepting a cryptocurrency. There's no loyalty in the market for Bitcoin except among fanatics. Retailers don't care which crypto they're using. Search "UK Merchant" in this sub and you'll see the survey I quote frequently that indicated 50% of Bitcoin-accepting merchants already accept an alt or would be willing to.

I appreciate the backhanded compliment, but I'm confused by your dismissive hand-waving. The OP said


Which is patently untrue. Anybody who paid more than $550 a BTC is starting to lose money. True to any ponzi scheme, its the earliest adopters that stand to gain the most. Everybody else is just encouraged to pay into the scheme and hold the bag for them. It's easy to encourage people to spend $500 on something when it only cost you $1.

Ugh, I've got a problem with this. See, I would venture to say the vast majority of investors in bitcoin didn't believe in the technology, because if you understand the technology you understand the price is irrelevant. Dogecoins, much "cheaper", can accomplish the same thing. Any coin with a higher supply can have "cheaper coins" and attain the same market cap. There's nothing inherently important in the price per cryptocoin, but Bitcoin commanded a (temporary?) premium for being "first", having a larger network, and being artificially "scarce"


As does LTC, WhateverCoin...I hope you're starting to see my point.

Again, only "bitcoins" are limited. You can, in fact, print as many other alts as you like that are all capable of the exact same function. You can have bitcoins circulating throughout the economy a lot easier...by not making them limited or including a function that forces use, but of course "get-rich-quick-for-doing-nothing" bitcoin holders don't want that


Is this a real question? It's a deflationary system, you hold because it supposedly increases your "wealth". 


Inflation isn't propping up the bankers, its propping up the whole economy.  Want an example?


Even you know that they aren't. Hundreds or thousands of stores would have already shuttered if they were actually counting on Bitcoin sales. You can Overstock could live on the &lt; 1% sales they do in BTC?

That sounds like one hell of a cop-out. At 17 years old you aren't qualified to judge whether or not high-school is important. As you've already discovered, trying hard in high school can lead to scholarships (or at least acceptance) at good colleges. You don't get to slack off in HS and claim it doesn't count, then go so far as to ask where you can get free money for being a slacker. 
High school means a lot more than you think. Waste your time there and assume it doesn't mean shit all you want, in five years you'll be working minimum wage and your friends who were smart enough to both try in school and recognize the importance of any education will be making big bucks. 
It's honestly hilarious to hear a 17-year old state which particular levels of education are unimportant.

I'm not sure how to quote you properly but:
"how else explain it's ban of BTC apps"
The blockchain app was removed because it was different than what was submitted to and approved by Apple. It was submitted as view-only, and then updated to be able to send and receive money. 
I don't want to see biased towards any cryptocurrency, in my opinion if you think BTC is a threat to Apple then you'd have to agree that Doge and any other crypto could also be a threat. Bitcoin may be the first, that doesn't mean it will be the best, main or most used crypto in the future
I really don't think bitcoin is a competitor to Apple, and I don't think they see them as one either. bitcoin could "succeed" independent of an Apple digital money system that would obviously be regulated to the gills. The userbases are very different and in many cases intertwined if you ask me. 
@_date: 2014-02-09 19:51:23
I've seen it posted dozens of times, "we can just patch that in to bitcoin". When a coin launches that has the features the average consumer considers so imperative that they switch over, they won't want any part of Bitcoin. There's no reason BTC would retain value, the owners of the new coin would just take over. 
Hint: They'd likely be a bank or government-regulated institution

I posted that sentence in response to this:


I had said, simply, 1000x increases in a "couple months" aren't sustainable. bitcoin went from $1 to $1000 in several months. I shouldn't have said "couple" that's my true crime here. You can say "tulpfutures accidentally said couple when he meant several one time" but that doesn't have as much punch.
I was correcting the guy, the price topped out over $1000, not $700. That's exactly why I said


in response to


this is, again, simply me correcting this guy.
Now, ready for this? A whole new sentence! Get ready for context!


I was talking about the increase from $1 to $1000 in a coupleseveral months. I wasn't multiplying $13 and 1000.

Your response is kind of frustrating me. No offense, but how are you so deluded as to think Mastercard might somehow use bitcoin rather than fight it? Bitcoin is supposed to end the tyrannical reign of credit card companies, isn't it?

I'll never understand people who are interested in bitcoin but still need things explained to them "like I'm 5". 
Frankly, it sounds like you haven't been following the news. I'm also not sure why you're just looking at market caps. Watch the price of the coin, not the meaningless caps. 
1. There have been DDoS attacks. These have basically exposed a vulnerability in Bitcoin that allows people to create a strain on transactions. It's a nuisance. A DoS attack is not a normal thing, and not a good thing. Nobody can say what always happens when there is a DoS attack, but it's just that, an attack.
2. Russia banned bitcoin
3. Canada and New York both announced pending strict regulations
4. The highest-priced exchange, Mt.Gox, is thought to be insolvent after this "malleability" stuff, and are now the lowest-priced exchange. 
The price of BTC crashed from nearly $900 to roughly $600, roughly a 30% drop after this series of bad news. Things are still trending downwards

do me a favor, go to a financial adviser and tell him you have a lot of "wealth", and then tell him your sexual fantasies and some information he can blackmail you with, and then ask him how much he thinks those are worth
btw, in your absolutely stupid example, any financial losses would have been insured under the traditional monetary system. BTC are gone forever.

that's wonderful...it doesn't mean bitcoins should have any more value. It's a ridiculous presumption that Bitcoins, which are not proprietary in any way, will somehow avoid incredible competition and will retain an artificial high. 
Think Myspace vs. Facebook, or if RC Cola was the first and only popular soda on the market.

I haven't read it but isn't this stuff in the White Paper or whatever? Bitcoin is anti-trust, which means you're never counting on the other party revering the charges. It may not be against your core values, nor mine, but I do believe it to be a foundation of the whole bitcoin ideology. 


Again, the same fundamentals apply. *Decentralized Cryptocurrency* means no authority, no regulation, no middle man (arbitrator), just one-way transactions with no provided identity information and at a low cost. I believe this arbitration would be good for Bitcoin, or any other coin, but I'm pretty sure it's against the founders intentions and many people here's beliefs. 


There's no reason for banks to implement a one-way payment system on top of the system they have that includes chargebacks. Consumers have proved it to be a valuable and necessary feature in commerce and the dozens of people posting about getting ripped off with Bitcoin is only a testament to that

yes but press doesn't always translate into sales. TigerDirect and Overstock both got "massive press" from Bitcoin, but that resulted in 1% of BTC sales for Overstock which has since declined to &gt;.1%.

Funny how you people trot out the "but email wasn't popular to start!". Email worked pretty great from day 1. It didn't have such gigantic growing pains, nor were people trusting email as a store of value. 
OP, great post. I love hearing over and over how instant and secure bitcoins are, and we both know that's not reality.

Demand to retain your own goods doesn't count as demand. Do you think a company produces, say, a lawnmower, decides they want to keep them all in case they're worth more in the future, and then claims there's a ton of demand for their product?

You aren't paying 2-3%, the merchant is. Bitcoin-accepting merchants haven't been providing discounts, nor should they. If it was created to save them money, fine, they're unlikely to pass that on to consumers. You don't save money to give it away. 


Yup, same here. I'm not saying bitcoin doesn't have a place for these kinds of transactions. It's the people here that think sending $100M uninsured via bitcoin is worth saving bank fees, or that mortgages will eventually be conducted via bitcoin.

I never said "no one pays for theft", you pay via your monthly fees and any other money the bank collects towards its insurance costs. 
If I pay $5 for my monthly account and lose $100,000 to a "hacker", I get my $100,000 back basically instantly and I continue to pay $5/month. Conversely, bitcoiners pay (almost) 0 fees but there's no getting your money back. 
The banks pay for theft. We pay the banks small monthly fees to securely store our money. This model works best for 99.999% of the population. Nobody pays "theft fees" specifically

It hit $1200 because of a complete speculative mania. I think the market (and it's expectations) have calmed down to meet reality. 


Myspace vs Facebook, not Betamax vs VHS. Bitcoin and altcoins are essentially identical. 


And here we arrive at my point. The price essentially doesn't matter, the functionality is the same. So it strikes me as "scamming" when people are still touting the eventual "$10,000 BTC" despite no real sound logical reason for it to reach such a figure
You don't care about the price, and that's wonderful. Neither do I. It's annoying to see people asking about how they can encourage their parents to buy a rig or buy Bitcoins on the faulty promise that the value will rise.

Coke isn't going to start selling Pepsi, a bank isn't going to use PayPal on their backend, and a tobacco company isn't going to completely change to ecigs because they're more futuristic or a small amount of people think they're "better". 
Mastercard is not going to be adopting or lobbying on behalf of bitcoin. To think so is utterly and completely stupid, and how dare you accuse somebody of saying otherwise "trolling".

This means that if you experienced any gain in value between when you received a bitcoin and spent it, that's a taxable gain


This means that any payments with bitcoin are taxable and reportable
So to directly answer your question, yes, you would have to pay CG taxes on your rent if you were, for example, trading a bitcoin you bought for $1 in exchange for a $500 rent. You would in that instance owe taxes on the $499 increase.

The funniest part is how obviously mad you are. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 03:43:22


Very simple answer: because bitcoin was designed to not use those necessary and crucial features. Its a trustless system, so loans and mortgages will never be implemented in any reasonable fashion that improves over traditional systems. Bitcoins will never have chargebacks, other cryptos might. There's several ways to improve upon bitcoin and if you're going to just suggest that bitcoin will emulate those I think a) you're assuming any of those changes will reach consensus and b) that the other altcoins it emulates will still be cheaper. 
At this point you're trying to argue that people should buy Premium USD for 2x the price of regular USD because Premium USD were "first" and they're totally better, you swear. There's NO REASON to use a more expensive, limited supply crypto over a cheaper, unlimited supply crypto, and thus no reason for a crypto to have any significant price at all. Competition WILL eventually drive down the price. Right now, you're like the owner of Coke, before Pepsi existed (assuming that's the correct order) charging $500/bottle for this new soda and praying that Pepsi never opens up and drives your overvaluation down

Let me just summarize things a little bit for you:
You said:


I look forward to the day when they begin to spend their wealth.
That's wonderful, but it isn't happening and it essentially isn't likely to. As a deflationary economy it makes sense to hoard. Not to save in a bank where they invest in the economy, not to spend and stimulate the economy, but to simply hold your bitcoins under your proverbial mattress. I'm sure you're excited for when early adopters decide to spend, but as bitcoin grows in value it makes less and less sense to spend and in the meantime the economy dies. 
I *love* that you're getting upvotes for just being a complete idiot who misconstrues or misunderstands simple economic fundamentals and have a discussion that amounts to "gee I can't wait for those thieves to buy sheets on overstock"

Depends who you ask.
The majority of people here want to believe the value will be $10,000-$1,000,000 each. This is assuming nobody wants to use any other crypto and everybody buys into the artificial and arbitrary "scarcity". Remember that 10% of all Bitcoins are in the hands of people who stole them, and another 10% belongs to Satoshi. An increase in Bitcoin's value to this degree would make the same criminals super-rich, but that's okay because bitcoin
Infinitely more likely is a reasonable $10-$100. bitcoins don't work any better at $100,000 each, nor are they any safer. People wishing for the price to increase simply want to get rich for doing nothing, nobody can honestly explain why 1 BTC should be worth $10,000 when other alts exist that can accomplish the same thing without the premise of a "get-rich-quick" scheme

The price convinces me every day. You think we're going up another 200% despite all the bad publicity, massive thefts, etc? All of the previous rises happened before Bitcoin had any real mainstream notoriety. I've said it before and you can quote me on it should I ever be proven wrong, but $1200 was "the moon" and I don't think it's remotely likely we'll ever get that high again. 




lmao. Surely there will be another bubble, we're just waiting for the next round of suckers, right? You don't think everybody who bought at $1000 has a bad taste in their mouth and will quickly dismiss BTC as a "good investment"?

You honestly seem a lot more "fucked up in the head" than me considering you post like three threads a day about how great Bitcoin is and can't handle *any* criticism without breaking down to this
My "bad intentions" are to honestly discuss Bitcoins. Here's something I'll share with you: today's fan mail






I'm encouraged by this to just continue what I'm doing and largely ignore whiny people like you who basically cry when I bring up any negative aspect of Bitcoin. Cry harder, go make ten more threads about Bitcoin and maybe you'll feel a little less insecure.

Well, credit cards operate on this thing called "credit" that Bitcoin doesn't offer, for starters. 
I carry a lot more than my credit card in my wallet. I carry ID, membership cards, health cards, etc. Even if I could pay using my phone I'd still be bringing my wallet with me.
In order to use your phone, you need both a smartphone and a data plan. Many of us here have both, but certainly not every credit card holder has these things. 
Lastly, credit cards are already more convenient than Bitcoins. I can simply tap my card on an NFC terminal and walk away. Stopping to scan a QR code and wait around for a confirmation is actually a lot more inconvenient than options already available to me. 
edit: You're also ignoring that people get cash-back, extended warranties, air miles etc using credit cards

What protections does Bitcoin have against being debased on confiscated? The price is volatile on it's own, and DPR might be able to tell you a story about confiscation. 


I don't think I'm going to continue this conversation, you're proving yourself to be quite the idiot. The money in my bank account is FDIC insured and grows with interest that I get for doing nothing. It's actually going the opposite direction. I make more money from interest and (insured) investments than inflation causes me to "lose", you don't even know what the fuck you're talking about do you?

So, I took every buy you made AFTER the peak (starting at $894) and that totals 20.46 BTC purchased for $13,200.
20.46 BTC is worth ~$10,500 today, for a loss of ~$3000
Yes, you could have made great returns if you were in on the ground floor, same for buying Pogs and beanie babies. For anybody else, this is a losing investment. 
Nice shilling, though. Congrats on your windfall, but don't pretend like this is a realistic investment for people to make. Anybody buying BTC this year, even using your averaging, has lost thousands. It gets considerably worse if I include the BTC you bought at the absolute peak, and *only* turns around because you managed to buy at $100 so often.

Stop encouraging people to waste their money "investing" in bitcoin. The price is overvalued, and is suffering a rather harsh correction. It's a payment system, not an investment, and it's not going to do anything towards stopping the "banksters and governments". 
If you want to make a change in society go to school, get an education, and get a job that can make a difference. Don't kid yourselves into thinking buying and selling bitcoin will change the world in any positive, meaningful way. It's just a different set of assholes hoping to get rich off others.

No. Bitcoins aren't good for anything other than as an exchange of value. There's nothing bitcoin does that's proprietary in any way.

Stay away from bitcoin as an investment. 
1. I don't know anything about what kind of wallet to use, but I know that if your wallet is ever compromised your money is gone for good. No reversing a transaction, no finding out who even stole your money. You'll be staring at a series of letters and numbers, you can't prosecute that. 
2. Bitcoin is ridiculous illiquid. People have issues with being unable to withdraw funds or BTC when prices are dropping, and a bitcoin that pays out one day could be totally gone the next. Again, no repercussions, no reimbursement. 
3. You would have to be insane to keep any portion of your investment portfolio in bitcoin. Maybe 1%, for the novelty, but don't ever expect that 1% will significantly grow, expect it to get stolen or lost by an exchange. 
Also, please notice how this post will get almost certainly downvoted, because bitcoiners don't want these truths known, they'd rather paint a rosy picture of the situation 100% of the time, refuse to acknowledge flaws, and shout down anybody with a dissenting opinion. It's essentially a ponzi scheme with a small amount of value to society. That value isn't more than $100 a bitcoin, they function the exact same whether they cost you $1 or $1000. No reason a cheaper altcoin couldn't become the future's "bitcoin", and there's no signs to indicate that bitcoin has the capability of being the "one coin capable of servicing the whole world", which is what would be necessary for the value to skyrocket. 
It simply isn't worth your time and the headaches as an investment unless you're willing to become an evangelist yourself and delude yourself that you'll ever see a $2000 coin

No reason to switch? How about 10% of Bitcoins belong to thieves? How about an altcoin that gives me some kind of points, or insurance for my purchases? How about an altcoin that can handle more than 7 transactions per second and doesn't need to waste as much electricity?
There's **dozens** of ways to improve on bitcoin, you're being intentionally naive to just assume nobody could compete. You admit yourself it's the exact same thing, Bitcoin has an *awful* reputation...how many more reasons do you need?


What's the irony there? Do you know what ironic means? A head start means absolutely nothing, and any crypto pegged to the USD would *instantly* be less volatile than Bitcoin...except then it couldn't make the same "get rich quick" bullshit promises that you're no doubt invested in

Exactly this. There's now 0 incentive for people to switch to Bitcoins. Not only do people pay fees to buy bitcoins, merchants don't even save on fees accepting them this way. The whole ideas was that eventually bitcoins become so prevalent that merchants offer a 1-2% discount, right? Using this Xapo card not only do consumers have to *pay extra* for this debit card, they aren't providing the merchants any of the perceived benefits of using bitcoins. Transactions aren't processed on the apparently-superior Bitcoin network, and merchants pay the same plastic swipe fees.

Let's say you have 1 Bitcoin.
You value it at $500
There are hundreds of other people willing to sell for $315. Nobody will buy your $500 Bitcoins. 
You'd need to collude with the other hundred bitcoin owners and refuse to sell your Bitcoins for less than $500. So someone asks to buy one and you say $500 firm and the sale is refused. One of your pals panics a little and says he is willing to sell for $495. The guy beside him says he'll do $490, and this continues until the price is $300 or less. 
You can't just manipulate the price. You want to pretend it's $500 like that is somehow reasonable you may as well pretend they are worth $1M each and refuse to sell for less. There are other people less foolish who will sell for what they can reasonably and consistently ask for.

For a little perspective, two months ago a tax attorney posted a thread answering questions about these same taxes
and these are some of the reactions he got:


If you tax Bitcoin, which cannot be taxed, it will be denied. Please, don't be stupid.


Governments, the monopoly of coercive force, are only interested in taxing people. Bitcoin, right now at least, seems untaxable. Taxation is theft and governments are mad because they cannot steal anymore. Bitcoin owners and miners have the moral high ground, not governments.


I have spoke with the IRS, and they said, as a miner, and I sell my bitcoin, is not consider capital gain or taxable income. Why as you said, you are a Tax Attorney you are coming up with this assumption?

I was, of course, looking for USD predictions, but I appreciate the answer regardless. 


Adoption can increase 1000x, that doesn't mean crypto values need to rise at all. The entire world can use Dogecoins for their needs (just an example, I'm not a dogecoiner) just as easily as it can use Bitcoin (for crypto-transfer purposes).
Basically, I don't think user adoption will necessarily lead to price increases. Saying as much just makes it sound more like a ponzi and willfully ignores competitive challenges (as if Bitcoin is Myspace and the network effect is impervious)

Haha yes your trivial little trademark case in which "Bit" in Bit Trade describes "bitcoins" means that "Bitcoins" is unenforceable. Got it! You're such a genius! I'm sure they didn't verify the worth of the trademark before listing it for sale but I'm sure you know better than trademark lawyers. "Bit trade" wouldn't infringe on "Bitcoins" anyway because IT DOESN"T CONTAIN THE SAME WORD YOU DULLARD. You didn't register "bitcoin trade" in which infringement might actually be relevant.
You're basically saying "Coca-Cola is unenforcable because I tried to register Coca-Pops and they didn't say anything about Coca-Cola!"

Even if I was alone on a desert island, the rest of the world would still have practical applications for gold. What an absolutely pathetic "analogy" or whatever. 


Bitcoin is *only* useful for exchange-of-value. Intrinsic value is the value of something *outside* of it's exchange value. Cash has none. Cheques have none. Gold does have intrinsic value. The Blockchain doesn't. You can't physically do anything with the blockchain that can be physically used in real life (gold conductors, diamond cutting) and it has no use outside of exchange-of-value. 


I'm sure they didn't, this is the stupidest argument tactic that's used *constantly* around here. Bitcoins aren't electricity or the internet or email. They are marginally useful and function the same at $1 or $1000 so people calling for $100,000 bitcoins are just hoping to scam people into overpaying for these *super-valuable* "Bitcoin" bitcoins

Your argument about increased commerce would almost be valid if the total number of bitcoins wasn't totally arbitrary. If $1 a bitcoin only allows $21M worth of commerce, then simple increase the total number of total bitcoins. Bitcoin holders are upset by that? Oh, I wonder why. Perhaps because as the people at the top of the ponzi they have an inherent interest in not devaluing their share. They don't care about utility. 
Again, if 21M coins at $1 each isn't enough there's literally no good reason not to just use, say, Litecoin. Boom, instantly 4x the commerce. To say we're stuck with an arbitrary number is ridiculous and basically proof that bitcoin owners are greedy rather than logical about the use of this technology. 
Beyond that, I honestly don't believe there's enough use-cases in the world to support more than $21M in bitcoin trade at once. You instantly convert to ActualMoney on both sides and those bitcoins go back into the "pot". This is how the value should be decided, using actual statistics, but instead bitcoin evangelists would rather argue that Satoshi's magic number is perfect and there's no reason to change it based on real-world applicability

@_date: 2014-02-28 02:04:39
Here's something very important for you to remember:
The price doesn't matter. A bitcoin (read: crypto) works the same whether you pay $1 for it or $1000, the only reason bitcoin commands any additional value is an arbitrary and artificial scarcity. Bitcoin will likely never rise to $10,000 simply because paying more for a bitcoin doesn't do anything but make the holders rich, other coins can do the same job cheaper. 
Bitcoin has first-mover advantage and a lot of VC behind it, but neither of those things guarantees success. 


I can't urge you strongly enough not to do this. You will likely lose all of your money, or at least devalue it. Adoption by large retailers didn't change the price, nothing is going to cause another 10x increase with no increase in utility or safety. People that think the price will magically start to skyrocket again are kidding themselves, or quite delusional.

Using this particular debit system a) merchants still pay the same fees and b)consumers (especially new ones) have to pay fees just to acquire bitcoin. There's absolutely no point for the average consumer to use this intermediary if the promise of future discounts is gone.

@_date: 2014-03-17 18:54:36
Simple: Greed. Despite being essentially the same thing, Bitcoin owners believe their cryptos are somehow more important or valuable than others capable of accomplishing the exact same functions. That's the reason they hoard rather than spend, the reason Overstock BTC sales have nosedived and the reason that British merchant survey (posted yesterday) seemed to indicate most merchants had 0 sales in BTC. 
It only makes sense, if something is rare and valuable you hoard it and it grows in value. Unfortunately, Bitcoins are neither rare nor inherently valuable. Dogecoin is doing a much better job demonstrating the benefits of crypto (because of the unlimited supply) than Bitcoin's perma-holders who don't want to spend anything lest it be worth a couple cents more tomorrow. It's glaring evidence of how poorly a deflationary economy would work. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 19:23:29


It's very effective. You spend, make investments in the economy, or you lose "value" to inflation. Deflation just means nobody spends and the economy withers. You're kidding yourself if you think that system will work, I say again that Bitcoin is doing a wonderful job of demonstrating how terrible a deflationary economy would be. Merchants aren't seeing sales, volume is in the gutter. The network for bitcoin is the same network for Dogecoin (they're both cryptos that function essentially the same way)


Saving money in a bank account that is actually lending your money out isn't the same thing as hoarding, pal. 


No, *you* don't seem to like that because then you don't gain "wealth" for doing nothing. Merchants don't care about the price, they care about the function.

People who think of alts as "the other coins" are bitcoin owners. Bitcoin owners are a microscopically small percentage of the US population, the actual market that matters has yet to decide on cryptos, and they certainly aren't brand-loyal to Bitcoin.

Ugh, dude. Gold is a real-world rare metal that essentially the entire world agrees has value. Real, solid, stable value, both intrinsically and as an exchange/store-of-value. Bitcoins are (mostly) wildly volatile and have an agreed-upon "value" by less than .01% of the world's population. Bitcoin, unlike gold, is *artificially* scarce and other, competing altcoins can accomplish the exact same tasks. Bitcoin is tremendously overvalued, there's literally no reason to pay $10,000 for a Bitcoin when you could use $10,000 worth of Anycoin to do the exact same thing. The funny thing about all of that is again that Bitcoin, supposedly like Gold, attempts to derive its value from scarcity (which isn't real) and demand (which can easily be absorbed by competitors as Bitcoin isn't proprietary in any way)

What a ridiculous example. Nobody in the world is ever going to conduct a $100M transaction with a non-zero chance of getting ripped off. The need for consumer protection actually grows significantly the higher the transaction is. 
Let's say I'm a business, and I want to buy $100M worth of paint from Taiwan. I can send the $100M via traditional banks, pay a modest fee, and be sure I'm protected. 
Alternatively, I can use bitcoin, save money on the transaction, and then lose ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS because the paint shop in Taiwan told me they're closed for business. 
I honestly don't know how you can't see the importance of this. You may be fine risking your money, most people aren't. 
it's not just about typos, it's about being protected from bad actors. Nobody in the world wants to conduct business in a fashion that risks the entire sum if the other party isn't totally honest and trustworthy. This is why bitcoin was created, for fairly small, trustless transactions

I meant a dollar value, I thought that was obvious. Even if you were in court they aren't going to award you "bitcoins", there's no accepted general value for a bitcoin. 
They aren't responsible because, and I can't believe you don't understand this already, you're operating in an unregulated, uninsured field. Mt.Gox has NO OBLIGATION to protect your bitcoins, or reimburse you for losses. That's the fun of playing in an unregulated environment. They can claim "hacked", run away with everybodys bitcoins, and very likely get away scot free. 
You spent real money buying internet funbucks and put those into an internet funbank with no guarantees of ever being repaid or seeing a single dollar back. Mt.Gox has no terms of service guaranteeing against losses or thefts, no security regulations whatsoever.

You're dreaming, pal. Assume Bitcoins and Litecoins are both used for international commerce at the same rate. They both accomplish the EXACT SAME TASKS. Why would Bitcoins be worth any more each? Arbitrary scarcity is not a good enough answer for the 99.9999% of people who currently don't use or care for bitcoin. There's no loyalty for bitcoin outside of this sub and other bitcoin sites. The vast and overwhelming majority of people have no preference, and will know Bitcoin as "that one where people lost millions and got nothing back"

If you say so it must be true. Who cares that 6% of the total supply was stolen right? Hopefully none of the 99.9999% of the world's population that haven't bought bitcoins yet. 
Bitcoin has gained significant ground, but it's also paved the way for other alts to do the same things. If a retail POS can accept Bitcoin it can accept every other alt. It's disingenuous at least to say that Bitcoin is on the way to becoming the leader, quite conversely it's doing a great job at ensuring it never becomes the lasting coin, it is already so plagued with reputation and wealth distribution problems

Stolen funds may be covered by what's called a banker's blanket bond, which is a multi-purpose insurance policy a bank purchases to protect itself from fire, flood, earthquake, robbery, defalcation, embezzlement and other causes of disappearing funds. In any event, an occurrence such as a fire or bank robbery may result in a loss to the bank but should not result in a loss to the bank's customers.
If a third party somehow gains access to your account and transacts business that you would not approve of, you must contact the bank and your local law enforcement authorities, who have jurisdiction over this type of wrongdoing.

"How can we make sure people keep paying more and more for our "bitcoins" rather than just use another crypto?"
The mania is over, the prices are going to keep sinking. It's not a matter of PR, there's been dozens of news stories in the past few weeks about Bitcoins and losing money, theft or fraud. Not about Litecoins, but specifically about Bitcoins. The reputation is tarnished, the hysterical rise is over, all that's left is a bunch of pathetic shills talking people into buying "cheap" Bitcoins for ~~$800~~~~$600~~$460
Only the stupidest, most gullible people believe the claims of a "$10,000 bitcoin" next year. The rest are adjusting their expectations and/or selling. You aren't going to be shilling any more people into buying your bitcoins for ridiculous premiums that don't result from either demand or utility.

Here's a few arguments for a need of a successor, from me personally:
Transaction limit of 7 tps. Apparently artificial and can be raised, but why all the talk of potential fixes? If it's so easy, just implement the change. By the way, that's a microscopic fraction of Visa's daily average. bitcoin DOES NOT scale. 
Limited coins. Bitcoiners expect the value of their coins to rise simple because other coins were lost to security flaws/"user ignorance" as you would say, or because there are no coins left to mine. This is a ridiculous premise so far-reaching that it's laughable. People would 100% more likely just use a coin with less limited supply, many of which already exist

This is a great post. Very succinct. I can't imagine why anybody would think the general public would be willing to pay twice tomorrow what they are willing to pay today for Bitcoins simply because running computers for money is suddenly less profitable for a bunch of people. 
The Bitcoin cost per transaction when including the block reward is something like $14 each. That's ludicrous. It strikes me as reasonable that that figure gets essentially chopped in half and that's the only effect. Getting rewarded an average $14 to process a transaction is ridiculous and arguing that the price should double is equivalent to arguing that this is a reasonable rate.

You realize your incoherent babbling is actually encouraging other people to parrot exactly what you say without considering whether or not it has any merit. Ironic!
I don't think you even understand the concept of "intrinsic value", which would be the usefulness of something *outside of its use as a medium of exchange*. Everything you wrote is borderline incoherent garbage that doesn't succinctly describe anything, let alone describe why Bitcoin does/does not have intrinsic value. 


You're hilariously conceited. The "only correct answer" certainly isn't the one you proposed. Bitcoin has *no* intrinsic value, because the code itself has no utilitarian use outside of exchanging value and bitcoin has no **proprietary** value since, of course, its open source and susceptible to competition. 
In closing, dear god don't embarrass yourself and act like you're some kind of authority on intrinsic value. You barely understand the concept and instead typed up a bunch of words trying to hand-waive away people's valid concerns.

Cool, so scarcity should never affect value. And since Bitcoins function the same as Litecoins (and remember the network effect is totally meaningless, it is no guarantee of success), either Litecoins should be worth an equal amount, or Bitcoins will (more likely) devalue to meet Litecoins and the other alts.

I haven't made any error. You have a perception that $700 should be the price for 1 BTC, I don't see that as sustainable and I think the price differential between (popular) cryptos will even out. 
How can you say they aren't a lower price when you get less BTC for $1 USD than you get in Doge? Any difference in price isn't sustainable, you're asking people to pay this LIMITED EDITION MEGA DEMAND premium for something that isn't even popular in the mainstream yet. 


Of course it isn't a problem, nothing is a problem for Bitcoin.

I don't think you understand. There is no signing or PIN, you just tap the card, wait approximately 3-5 seconds for Authorized to appear, and then start pumping gas or walk away with your food. 


It *isn't* the same number of steps. Tapping your NFC card is 1 step. Unlocking your phone, confirming the amount or entering some credentials is at least more than 1 step, and I wouldn't expect any bitcoiners to allow unauthorized, instant-verified (by the bitcoiner) transactions. Credit cards and banks only allow NFC-type systems because they have the money for insurances and the infrastructure, and their customers like convenience. It makes no sense for bitcoiners to allow this kind of risk, and the push vs pull payment mechanism of Bitcoin will always make it inherently more inconvenient than NFC-enabled **1-step** credit/debit cards
@_date: 2014-03-24 00:21:37


You're right. People have to spend money on the essentials (food, rent) but when your currency or commodity will be worth more next year than tomorrow you wait to buy the extra things in life. When people stop spending and stimulating the economy, people lose jobs and the economy starts to wither.


Less bitcoin, possibly. If a company is paying .1 BTC/hr and next year that's more USD/other currencies, they might decrease pay to .092 BTC/hr next year. Paying the same would equate to paying more as time goes on and each BTC appreciates


No is my answer to both of these, but lending BTC for mortgages just doesn't make sense. If I lend you 100 BTC for a house and in 20 years I expect 110BTC, how can you repay that? each Bitcoin is worth more, plus I expect you to pay me even more of them. Banks would never issue a 100 BTC loan and expect 98 BTC back due to deflation. 


The countries economy would wither away and fall into severe depression, the few people who hoarded BTC would be rich and those without it would be worse off every day. It would never work because it's a nightmare, economically speaking. There are no countries with deflationary currencies in practice today as far as I know.

Why are you criticizing my conversational skills when you vaguely express what you mean? Supply on the markets and the capped supply of Bitcoin are intertwined, they are relevant at all times. If it were based on supply and demand, volume wouldn't have dropped because people would be worried about running out of bitcoins. Volume has dropped, it is evident people aren't worried about running out and thus don't care to buy BTC. Lack of good news and more bad news is essentially ensuring that Bitcoin doesn't see another 1000x rise.

If I don't hear what I consider to be total nonsense about usurping governments and buying a Bentley for my 1.5 BTC in the future, I support the idea of any protocol that can save merchants money, or save poor people money on transaction fees. If WU and Visa's network is too outdated, or their profit levels too high, then I don't mind another company taking advantage of that. This doesn't necessitate this hysterical overvaluation of the data used while transferring money. I don't believe this deflationary currency would ever succeed if used as an everyday system, this notion of holding your money, contributing nothing to society, and it growing in value is absurd to me. 
Cryptos also certainly seem useful for microtransactions, I guess CC's don't want a part of that business and if a Bitcoin can handle the activity then sure, why not. This, again, doesn't necessitate a ridiculous overvaluation per coin/unit


I couldn't say. I really only know of BTC, LTC, DOGE and maybe 5-6 other "notable" alts (Maxcoin, Auroracoin) and I don't "hate" bitcoin so much as I hate the pretentiousness of the owners who can't accept valid criticisms or label non-believers "trolls" or "idiots" for not choosing to value the same data.

Probably the most intelligent and well-thought out post I've read here so far. Thanks for the reply. 
I wish people would just refrain from claiming Bitcoin would absorb another coin, I just don't see the incentive for the owners of the new coin. I'm unfamiliar with what development on higher layers you're discussing, if you could outline them that would be great
I'll have to read about ethereum. I think fees are a necessity in safe money transfer so you talking about a more complex fee system doesn't really bother me. Why don't you think it could be a sound store of value if it has features superior to BTC? (again, I still have to read up on it, and will)
I simply don't think the value is going to rise significantly. The price didn't budge when O.co and TD started accepting, I think most people realize now that a $2000 bitcoin isn't likely to happen. Like you said, the utility doesn't change. People are smart, if they understand how it works they'll understand how arbitrary the value is.

Gold has no competitor. Bitcoin does, they just aren't as popular or well known yet. I'd wager most people equate Bitcoin to all cryprocurrencies, and I think it will be a harsh awakening when most people realize the utility of Bitcoin isn't proprietary or particularly valuable. 


Do you see how stupid it is to claim that a market deems something useless $100, and something not-totally-useless $500? You're trying to rationalize what is an admittedly irrational market. There isn't an consensus agreement that one exchanges bitcoins are worth more, it's just a wild west market where you take what you can convince the guy to give you, and thus it hovers around "safe" prices and then wildly fluctuates at the slightest bit of good or bad news. 
There's nothing propping up Bitcoins at $500 other than new people assuming that's a fair price and buying in, and current traders keeping it roughly stable. If new people coming to the system think the price is just going down and down and not given some amazing new feature or service to bitcoin, they have no incentive to buy in now when they can just wait for cheaper and cheaper bitcoins, or switch to a competing altcoin altogether.

Dude. Miners giving up means turning off a computer. The price doubling means finding thousands of people willing to support a price level twice what they are willing to pay today because of some arbitrary scarcity. 
I don't know that I can converse with somebody who thinks it is easier to double the price of a multi-billion market cap commodity than to turn off a bitcoin rig. 


Please refrain from this, I'm being polite with you. 


It really isn't. You're talking about how consumers, the source of demand, don't matter. Only the supply. Supply will dictate the demand and the price, apparently. It's ludicrous. 
I'd like you to link me to your prediction that $300 was the "new normal" if you have it handy. 


And you're thinking like an economics 101 student. The world isn't so black and white. If demand isn't actually meeting supply at $300 (ie tons of coins are actually being sold cheaper) then there's nothing that promises a reduced supply would result in any market price increase at all. That's economics 102, sorry you didn't make it? 


Bitcoins are computer data, inherently non-scarce. This is why the price won't necessarily double.


Apples are a real world item with real-world scarcity. You can actually have an apple shortage. There isn't and never will be a cryptocurrency shortage. People buying Bitcoins for $300 today don't necessarily care about the shortage of supply, some people are using them for their utility as a cryptocurrency, the same utility that can be performed by literally any other cryptocurrency if for some reason lunatic Bitcoiners begin demanding $2000/BTC when other available options exist

"it is currently going mainstream" 
Oh, you mean gaining no additional value after being "accepted" my major retailers, and then crashing into oblivion? Yeah, I can totally see how that's the same thing as mp3s. You're greatly inflating the value of bitcoin. I'm being cautious and logical, you're essentially blinded by your own greed if you think Bitcoin is as innovative as The Internet. 
Also you look like a 10-year old when you resort to calling names. I'm very offended, as you can tell.

No, it isn't, but I understand your need to back away at this point


But you're claiming that century-old system has something to learn from a single audit of a single BTC exchange. It's ridiculous, dude. I'm not trying to be rude with you, but your topic and subject are just ridiculous. The world of BTC has TONS to learn from modern banking regulations, not the other way around


A ton of problems the modern banking industry has already solved via GAAP, regulations and audits. 


Wow, you mean banks can authorize transactions? That's a breakthrough in banking for sure!


You've been able to do all of these things for decades. 


You can't prove any of that stuff if transactions are happening off-chain. 
Here's some reading material for you:

Make no mistake about it, bitcoin was a real bubble. Sorry you don't like my tone, I believe that was in response to an annoying "LOL U JUST JEALOUS" idiot, but can't be bothered to check right now. 


Respectfully, I don't believe Bitcoin has a significant amount of supporters, certainly not so much as to be insurmountable. 99.999% of the world's financial market hasn't yet purchased a cryptocoin, maybe they never will, but if they do they certainly aren't loyal to bitcoin, and reputation issues might actually incline them elsewhere
@_date: 2014-03-27 17:06:52


Haha, wasn't something "empirically false" one post ago? Goddamn you're dense dude. 


No shit. And BTC will have the highest value forever, right? You're being intentionally naive here (I think. There's a good chance you're just this stupid)


And the modern banking system network is infinitely bigger than Bitcoins. Do you even understand why "the network effect" is completely irrelevant? You are an owner of a MySpace share, and when people try to tell you about up-and-coming stuff like Facebook you choose to plug your ears and play stupid. Suit yourself. 


Wow, no kidding! You're **still** not understanding this very basic concept. Bitcoin is essentially building the "cell towers" that literally every other crypto will be able to take advantage of. If there's a Bitcoin ATM, that can easily be an AnyCoin ATM. If a merchant accepts BTC, they can just as easily accept AnyCoin. There's no loyalty among merchants or the 99.9% of the population who haven't bought Bitcoins. 
You're a completely dense, delusional moron who thinks Bitcoin is invincible and the 500,000-1M users of Bitcoin "network effect" is apparently insurmountable. With bitcoin less than half the ATH and still falling fast, I'm not sure where you get your delusional confidence from.

Why did you write all of that to me? I said "cash has no intrinsic value". That's it. I don't need an (incorrect) explanation of The Fed's accounting process. "Cash" and the fiat banking system isn't about "confidence" like Bitcoin is. The USD has the US government "backing" it. Financial institutions regulating its use and providing consumer protections. Other than knowing at least one other person out there is willing to buy your Bitcoin, there's no reason to buy one. It's a digital rock, valuable because a relative handful of people have agreed upon it. People have confidence in the USD because they know their landlord will accept it, and they can pay taxes with it. **Legal tender** is a pretty big distinction from a group of ~750,000 people saying their data is worth $10,000/unit.

It's not a fact you moron. If people could buy at $1200 that was a very real price for them.

God damn you're annoying. 


It's not trolling if I disagree with your idiotic opinions, pal.

The savings of accepting Bitcoin via Bitpay vs nowhere near 3%. I think I read that Overstock is paying 1% through BitPay and they weren't likely paying more than 2.5% with Visa/Mastercard, so the savings is AT MOST 1.5% MINUS what it cost them to set up Bitcoin payments, which of course wasn't free. Overstock commented on how many employees they had working around-the-clock getting ready to accept Bitcoin, it wasn't as simply as one phone call to Bitpay.

so nothing, really. We're yet to see if they're being charged for massive money laundering or a dozen other things. Doesn't necessarily mean they're intent on tracking down bitcoin thieves. I'm still fairly certain they won't, and that the subpoena isn't to begin some great bitcoin crime investigation but rather to subpoena Mt.Gox for their mountain of verified user data to investigate money laundering or, again, a litany of other crimes Mt.Gox themselves may be liable for 
@_date: 2014-02-16 23:43:11

Well, why are you buying bitcoins? If it's to make money, then I'd say don't bother risking your money, but if you must then just buy and hold. If you're trying to help the "bitcoin economy" succeed, you should spend that BTC and immediately buy more
@_date: 2014-02-20 22:41:59
Hey, that's fine. I'm certainly enjoying the ride and all the news/stories coming from it, but I can't help but feel bad for all the people who thought they might get rich easy and are instead broke. 
Gox might be dying today/soon, but that doesn't mean other exchanges won't follow. The result could be the whole speculating fad dying and the artificial price increase dying with it. The $110 BTCs people are buying there function the same (assuming they weren't locked away) as the $600 bitcoins other exchanges are selling, if the average buyer realizes this and the speculators see the game as over the house of cards collapses pretty quick and all the exchanges would be sub-$100. Bitcoins are only worth more than Gox's price for them if you can convince people to pay that much continuously, it's a show that bitcoin has to keep going. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 03:46:51
You're very welcome. To expand a little further, bitcoin was initially created with some very libertarian values in mind, and the pseudo-anonymity of bitcoin aimed to avoid tax remittance and ensure there's no financial oversight in a personal bank account. It is, for this reason, a rather effective money-laundering tool. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 22:54:22
Bitcoiners expect people to pay increasing amounts for each "unit" of a function based on artificial scarcity. (Dogecoins, Litecoins vs Bitcoins, literally no reason for the price difference). The value is in currency exchange, not in each unit. Cryptocoins aren't limited, only Bitcoins are and it's essentially a joke that Bitcoin owners expect to get rich(er) for doing nothing but running some computer code in their basement
I could go on!

Sure, but again if all Bitcoiners want to hold and not sell for less than $10,000 then Company A spends a billion dollars on their own infrastructure, network, and sells their own coins for $9000. It might not be decentralized but for remittance purposes so long as it works like Bitcoins (convertible to local currency) then it would work as well.

Those quoted statements are in no way comprehensive. Where's the definitive stipulation regarding what passwords are strong enough? You're quoting a general Q&amp;A after I've already told you I've seen multiple BTC insurance policies and they have almost entirely been worthless. 
Find me quotes directly from Meridian regarding what is covered and what isn't. Nothing I said has changed or is wrong, you're just mindlessly encouraged by the phrase "we have insurance" whether that insurance is worth a damn or not. 
A couple months back there was a company providing insurance "Backed by Lloyds of London". If you bothered to actually read their policy it was almost entirely worthless. I'm suggesting you do the same for Meridian before trusting that Xapo hasn't ensured they'll have a million loopholes out of any payments. 
oh, one more thing:




Learn to read and properly interpret what you've read. Saying "we have insurance! backed by Meridian!" means absolutely nothing if the policy is entirely full of holes (which it certainly is considering nobody reads these things before "insuring" their money)

"So if the goverment would be to create their own bitcoin, they would have to bastardize every aspect of the protocol that makes it what it is: Centralized instead of decentralized, closed source instead of open source, trust in a single authority instead of trust-free transactions. And isn't that what we have already today with the banking system?"
it is, with a very slight modification to basically implement anything that bitcoin hoped to offer that was different. I think maybe you're starting to get the picture?

Not just the price, the *reputation*. There is little reason to believe BTC will experience significant growth within the next few weeks or months. Now is a good time to be patient and see how everything pans out. 
If you want to save money, do it in a bank. You have a 0% chance of losing money, and your bank will guarantee a (very small if only $100) interest rate. 
With Bitcoins, you stand a small chance at making a small profit, but a much larger chance at your money sitting stagnant or devaluing.

The electricity rate would be whatever you're paying locally for electricity. In general most people just suggest you buy bitcoins rather than mine, unless you're investing like $10k or more. As a bonus, bitcoin is crashing a bit right now and you can buy them cheap
You could also mine for altcoins and then sell them for bitcoins, I heard that's a decent option, but I would still suggest just buying bitcoins
oh, and the "difficulty" and block stuff is a bit too nerdy for me to really get into but basically you'll get less bitcoins and make less money over time as the difficulty rises, this is so you spend more money on mining equipment. "profitable" equipment today would begin to run at a loss as difficulty increases and block reward decreases

Okay pal. Your argument is so stupid the laughter has spread to other subreddits.
To demonstrate the lack of (intrinsic and overall) value of food, water and air, please go without all three for several days. Perhaps then you will understand why each of those things have value regardless of their supply. 
You don't have to pay for something for it to have value, you absolute idiot. If the absence of something meant the end of humanity, it has value regardless of the supply or perceived financial "value". I cannot believe I have to spell this out for you, or that you actually thought you "won" an internet argument by stating that food, air and water are valueless.

I'm not sure about "a random altcoin", I just think they would be more likely to pump their own coin than another coin that enriches other early adopters in the process (unnecessarily). 
If they made some WallStCoin there would be more demand for that overnight than anything. There's no reason to piggyback their whole venture on a coin already 10% owned by thieves,  etc

I wouldn't argue this, except that Bitcoin has significant reputation issues that may have ruined or limited their first-mover advantage. MySpace was the first big social media business, but their "first on the scene" doesn't mean anything just a few years later. 


Right. And since they function the same (and on the same hardware, ATMs, POS units) and strides that Bitcoin makes into retail space can easily be realized by other cryptos. Bitcoin is paving the way, no doubt about it, but I'm still not confident it hasn't totally squandered first-mover advantage

Exactly, so why should each BTC be worth increasing amounts due to "scarcity" that doesn't really exist. Cryptos aren't scarce, only BTC is. There's literally no reason for BTC to have such a high valuation as it does, other than increasing wealth for early adopters. 


I don't, but BTC already has a terrible public reputation and is ALREADY owned 10% by thieves. Now we're supposed to pay more for a dwindling supply when the two major contributors to that limitation are a) an artificial limit and b) massive thefts. It's more likely, in my opinion, that the general public would use an alt than use Bitcoin. There's no loyalty among the general public towards Bitcoin.

Actually, Dogecoin seems to be doing that job pretty well, ironically.

-typical r/bitcoin response
You probably don't need to care about bitcoins. They propose to save merchants on credit card fees (so long as they pay other fees, convert to USD right away or face price volatility, and don't actually want/need to use credit). As a daily consumer you may never have a need to use bitcoins. Assuming there's no "bitcoin discount" you'll pay more for the item with the transaction fee using bitcoin that using cash or a debit/credit card. If you ever wanted to totally unsecurely send money across the world with no way of retrieving it if you need to for any reason, bitcoin can do so for pretty cheap, assuming the other person can easily convert BTC to their local currency or wants BTC to hold or spend.

This isn't a relevant example. It's more like you park your car in a lot and there's a big sign saying you can't get back in your car and if it goes missing they don't owe you shit except your parking fee. Do you still "own" the car parked at the lot you can't access or drive? 
Indeed, from a legal point of view there is no doubt - that users of Gox agreed to a limited liability agreement. I'm still correct. You may technically "own" your bitcoins (or car) but you can't see or access them and you aren't getting anything back when they are stolen from you.

Bitcoins value, in the eyes of both an investor and true believer for worldwide currency domination, is partially based on worldwide acceptance. There might not be Russian nodes, but no Russian citizens can shop using bitcoin and no Russian stores can accept it as payment.

Before you agree to lay any money down, Bitcoiners spent money in droves when overstock started accepting payments, they have since petered out and essentially went from $130,000 on Day 1 to $13,000 a day. Sales have DECREASED by 90% already if you look at it that way. 
What do you think is going to make people start spending BTC again? It's a deflationary currency, increasing in value if you hoard it. I think you're dreaming to assume sales will increase tenfold after decreasing tenfold already, but that's why I'm willing to put my money where my mouth it.

You can live off of *anything* if you're able to trade it for cash before a transaction occurs. This doesn't lend any credibility to the idea of living day-to-day off of that aforementioned whatever. 
Do me a favor: Conduct your wonderful experiment, and write down what percentage of your transactions were paid for in fiat cash to the merchant. I suspect it will be a solid 100%. Using an intermediary removes you as the payee. When you use a credit card, Visa is the payee. When you use BitPay, BitPay is the payee, not you. It's just cashing out.

Your example doesn't make a lot of sense. Apple Geniuses are just customer service experts. If CoinBase or BitPay handle the BTC payments then Radioshack have nothing to do with BTC...so how are Radioshack therefore experts? 


If that's the case I don't think Bitcoin has the capacity to change the perception (or business) of any company in any significant way.

"Millions of people sending half-cents every second equates to excellent revenue." 
You mean in miner transaction fees, right? Businesses aren't going to be  making any real money in microtransactions. You want to make a dollar, not two hundred half pennies. 
Nobody I know, and I think realistically the general public, feels their information is "held captive". That's some very strong language. People in polite society understand that when being issued credit, like with Visa, you have to provide them some information. Same with a bank, in exchange for securing your savings. 
I don't exactly know what you mean when you say my credit card can keep taking money from me. I pay them for the stuff I used the card for, and sometimes a bit in interest, and also an annual fee. Why would they take any money from me, and how would they do it? Just insist to my bank that it's due? The accounts aren't linked in any way. 
BTC lets you control your funds, but now you're talking about avoiding remittances and basically skipping out on taxes. I don't know why you're comparing 1% trans fees to what a credit card charges a merchant. That's credit, bitcoin is not. Also there's consumer protection, which is easily worth 1-2%. 
Bitcoin lets people transact, but there's still a middleman, don't be disingenuous. Right now it's bitpay and a miner processing the transaction. It will always at least involve that miner.

1% (or slightly higher) isn't bad at all considering you don't need to get verified by an exchange or pay above-market prices at localbitcoins or coinbase to buy some BTC as a new user. It's better than WU and paypal for amounts that small and basically perfectly fits their niche. 
I honestly challenge you to realistically compare the percentage of fees and time a completely new user would incur to send $900 worth of bitcoin vs. paying $9.50 to send someone else $900 Walmart-to-Walmart. Any above-market price on roughly 2 bitcoins, any exchange or miners fees, and then any applicable cash-out fees. You'll see how much "cheaper and easier" Bitcoin is then.

Honestly, I think it's probably a wise time to cash out and all of the points you made a remarkably clear-sighted for someone posting on r/bitcoin. It's unlikely, in my opinion, that bitcoin will see a significant rise (read: $1000 bitcoins). Acceptance by major retailers failed to raise the price of bitcoins, and the astronomical increases most holders are looking for is more of a pipe dream at this point
If TD and O.co accepting them didn't skyrocket the value, essentially nothing will. There's simply no reason that bitcoins should be worth more than people are paying for them now, and even that value is rather arbitrary. If there were a shortage of coins, it would be more likely that users would switch to a more-available crypto (like LTC?) than pay higher fees for bitcoins, which haven't really changed in "value" since they were under $10.

Sorry, but no. There's still Chinese money at play, you can't call it "priced out" until 100% of that is gone. 
If China were truly priced out I might expect the price to increase, like, today. Instead, it's still sitting under $450 and has been ticking down since the most recent bank announcement this morning. 
Again, sorry, but politely you're wrong. Everybody knows the situation in China is bad...but it's still certainly affecting the market. If they are truly only 7% of the current bitcoin economy, then expect another 7% drop before we can really call them "priced out"

How about I move my funds between two personal bank accounts (for absolutely free) and compare that to moving BTC between two wallets I own? That's apples to apples. For some reason, bitcoiners have a tough time figuring out what "apples to apples" actually means. 
Western Union doesn't involve the recipient figuring out where to cash out his bitcoins, nor does it involve the sender having to get verified at an exchange and pay above-market rates for each unit of transfer
If you include all the real, applicable costs to a bitcoin transaction instead of argue disingenuously like you're trying to it's pretty apparent that not only is bitcoin barely (if at all) cheaper than some traditional payment methods, it's a hell of a lot more cumbersome for new users. 
@_date: 2014-05-09 15:42:10

yeah, that's where you're wrong. 99.999% of the world hasn't touched a crypto and certainly isn't loyal to or stuck with Bitcoin. They can enjoy the same functionality and benefits from literally any alt they desire to support, and they can consciously decide not to support the 10% thief-owned economy of Bitcoin. 
I absolutely knew you were going to trot out that "but the 1% are basically thieves!" bullshit. So entertaining, what a laughably stupid comparison to people who LITERALLY STOLE MONEY DIRECTLY FROM PEOPLE and are now going to profit off it even more simply because you assume we MUST use Bitcoin.

TigerDirect and Overstock both don't directly accept Bitcoins, in fact most retailers don't and most bitcoiners rejoice there's something like BitPay that allows them to spend their funbucks. Coinbase and BitPay are genius companies making money selling magic internet funbucks back to other buyers and taking a cut, nothing more. They lobby merchants to accept USD sales converted from BTC, with the conversion and conversion fees handled by them. They can actually do the exact same work with other coins, and soon will I'm sure. 
I don't have anything bad to say about Andressen, but I'm sure he understands that bitcoin's reputation has been tarnished forever and as a result we'll never see the kind of growth we could have potentially seen.


In all seriousness, LiteCoin and DogeCoin are both competitors. There's good news about stupid Dogecoin coming out every other day and bad news about Bitcoin coming out every day. 99.9% of the population hasn't bought a crypto and don't have any loyalty towards Bitcoin. 
The infrastructure being built, crypto ATMs and merchants accepting cryptos, are accessible by all cryptos. bitcoin doesn't have some trademark attached that prevents other cryptos, once they gain more popularity, from piggybacking on the same network of merchants.

@_date: 2014-02-28 02:17:55
No? Why would it? Bitcoins wouldn't become any more rare or usable, they would work the exact same as they did before they were more than $100. 
Bitcoin owners *expect* the price to skyrocket once everybody is using them, but this is partially because there's an artificial limit on bitcoins. The general public isn't going to pay a "tax" for using Bitcoins when they can just use an altcoin to do the same function. If a retailer can accept bitcoins, it's very little work for them to accept an altcoin. There's literally no reason for bitcoin to be worth more than any altcoin other than the fact that bitcoin owners don't want it to be worth so little, they want to keep pretending the bitcoins they own are unique and rare and more valuable than AnyOtherCoin. 
Again, "mainstream" retailers already have begun to accept bitcoin, it didn't do anything for the price. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:11:13
Sure. I never contended the same issue doesn't exist with cash. However, with cash, you're not anonymous. You have to physically deliver cash, at the very least.

Russia banning bitcoin might not be important/relevant in your eyes, but it's relevant enough in the eyes of hundreds (thousands?) of people to drop the price of the currency 20% (in combination with other news, but I believe this to be a major contributor)
Russia affecting BTC's price short- and long-term affects it both as a currency AND as an investment, for what I hope are obvious reasons.

When you include miners subsidies the cost of a transaction in the bitcoin network is $20+ , far more inefficient than credit card provider networks. 
All cc companies need to do to survive is continue to ignore bitcoins. Remember,  overstock does less than .1% of their business in btc,  credit cards are and will remain the primary payment method . 
This "bitcoin is taking over" stuff is enormously stupid considering media attention is down, transaction volume is down, overstock sales have dropped 90%. 


Bitcoin doesn't do 10% of the business of a single credit card company. With underwhelming results like Overstock, retailers aren't seeing Bitcoins as some amazing tool for unrealized success.

Nah, but get this: A coin pegged to the USD 1:1 it runs on the bitcoin network, 100% premined and secured by probably a single government computer. Backed by the US Government and for every USDcoin printed they destroy a US dollar (no change of US money supply). When someone needs to send $500 overseas, they buy $500 in USDcoin and then send it. It's not something to be hoarded and there's no benefit in doing so. Nobody "gets rich quick" for doing nothing. Every store and person in the US/world could accept them as they would a dollar
An arbitrary limit doesn't make any sense, deflationary economies are stupid and most people that mindlessly support bitcoin without simply seeing it as a crypto like any other to be improved upon, competed with and likely surpassed in use by a more rational, functional and features coin like the one mentioned above.

@_date: 2014-02-21 03:16:08


This isn't even remotely comparable to what I was saying. 


I already said it presumably *would* offer you something new. You don't even want to hear that part, you're just too quick to discount the idea. There's no new training, accepting an altcoin would work the same way as accepting a bitcoin and there's another Bitpay for alts waiting in the wings, obviously. Again, nothing proprietary about bitcoin. You're disingenuously arguing that it's some gigantic extra effort to accept altcoins once you've already used bitcoins. IT"S THE SAME THING. 
I'm really curious what you would have to see to believe Bitcoin would hit a 100B market cap. What metric would do it for you? 100,000 business that accept bitcoin? 50,000,000 unique addresses in use? What would it take? Obviously, the market cap of USD is well beyond 100B, but why? What is it about USD that you believe gives it it's value? 
There's nothing that could convince me each of bitcoin's 21M bitcoins is inherently more valuable than Dogecoin's infinite coins. I know that's not something you agree with because you simply refuse to acknowledge that there's no basis for an overpriced bitcoin, you simply don't want to give up that artificial and hysterical overvaluation and are ridiculously trying to justify it by comparing Bitcoins (a currency, supposedly) to Twitter, a company. More twitter users makes twitter more valuable, but infinite altcoins users doesn't necessarily need to make that altcoin any more valuable, ESPECIALLY when that value is supposed to come from an **arbitrary and artificial scarcity**
I'm done here. You aren't debating even remotely honestly and are obviously totally ingrained in the cult of Bitcoin. May you one day realize there's absolutely nothing special about Bitcoin. 
To put it in probably too-simple terms, it's like you're an early investor in Visa and you don't think there will ever be a Mastercard, except in this case people complain every single day about losing money to scammers on Visa and Mastercard just announced they have insurance and regulation and safeguards and chargebacks and you're still standing there, fingers in your ears, certain in your own delusion that a competitor could never possibly emerge

And the supply is artificial and the demand is at an all-time low. Congratulations on reading an entry-level economics book but not actually considering exterior factors.

Why do you assume the fee would be small? Not trying to be snarky, insuring users against volatility would be **very** expensive, as the company would have to absorb all that risk. Are they going to eat a $50/BTC devaluation for thousands of users for $10/month? I don't think so. 
It's an interesting concept, but I believe prohibitively expensive. Bitcoins weren't made to be stored and insured with paid services, those kinds of things would bring the cost of using bitcoins close to or over the cost of using fiat, which was the whole point of Bitcoins. 
If a merchant has to pay insurance and storage for coins he accepts, if that going to be any cheaper than CC fees? I don't think so.

Yes, it's true, nobody can reverse transactions. This isn't always a good thing (I've seen people send money to scammers they wish they could get back, or even typo the send-to address). In fact, reversing transactions would go a long way to PREVENT stealing people's bitcoins, so I wouldn't exactly say it "holds true"

You won't be able to prove whether it was lost or stolen, it's *so* easy to lie about the circumstances and LEO are never going to prod. You're talking about stealing "something of value", but how does a court agree to Bitcoins value? Gox could claim every BTC they own was one of the 2009 BTC that cost less than a dollar. 
Yes, consumer protections come with a price, but the vast and overwhelming majority of people believe the prices are fair enough for the security provided. "Being able to take on these risks oneself" is not something many people want to do to save a couple bucks. 
You're also ignoring that Bitcoin still has fees, sometimes substantial, but provides 0 consumer protection in exchange. You're getting much less for your transaction fee money from bitcoin than you are from Visa

I don't think you should be so sure of this. Your accountant couldn't have known about the guidelines handed down today, and if you deceived him about the source of the funds or otherwise lied on your business' books you could be guilty of money laundering. I can't imagine how you claimed selling bitcoins was relevant to your business, unless your business is literally selling bitcoins.

Mining is also the seeding of the market in addition to processing transactions.
No, it's completely valid. If you have to run your computers on this terribly inefficient system to validate the transactions then the cost of that electricity is absolutely a part of the "costs" involved in a transaction. Someone is paying those fees.

Similarly, Google Wallets has 0-fee transfers for users who have accounts linked to their bank accounts (US only, for now) . Obviously bitcoin appeals to the unbanked, but you can't really beat 0 fees and a trusted name like Google providing you are okay linking your account. 
Google doesn't value each individual unit of transfer, and isn't concerned about "market cap" for this service because it's essentially infinite. I struggle to understand why people should pay $500 or $1000 for each "unit of transfer" when using Bitcoins as opposed to services like Google who don't have limited units and don't overvalue each unit. 
Like, for a US user, I can now send money to my friend in California or Sister in New York for free. Absolutely free. If I'm sending $1000 USD, why should I buy $1000 worth of BTC, pay a fee for buying them, a fee for sending them, and have the receiver pay a fee for cashing out?

They won't be going back up to $900 anytime soon if that's what you really want to know. Nobody will be able to convince you they will go up in value because there's nothing to make them go up in value. Scarcity isn't relevant, large retailers have already adopted and the price didn't budge, and volume is at an all-time low. Mining difficulty just increased as well, so that's less profitable as well.

How can you type that out as a genuine argument when people have lost millions in BTC already and you can't do anything in the BTC world without a third-party helping you. Coinbase, vein-scanning ATMs, exchanges and BitPay are all examples of unnecessary third-parties making a cut, so what's your big fucking problem with bankers? If Gox was anything like a bank the money wouldn't be lost, or at least the losses would have been insured. 
Funny enough, if this was a month ago you'd probably be talking up Neo &amp; Bee and how great that'll be.

Your girlfriend is right. Early adopters own a gigantic quantity of bitcoins from when they were cheap, the creator retained ~1M bitcoins, thieves have stolen at least 6% of the total supply so far. Bitcoin basically has wealth distribution problems equal to fiat, but it's a different group of people at "the top" so apparently that's okay
Here's a relevant link:

No, it isn't. You can't prove anything showing the blockchain to some judge. Assuming you've just purchased a car, and then got arrested for driving it.

You may as well be showing a personal Excel spreadsheet you created that you share with a bunch of other people. It's totally legally irrelevant and non-binding.

This is hardly worth rehashing, but alas-
You said "Russia banning BTC is not having an effect on BTC itself", and then "panic selling by people whose BTC transactions will likely never be directly affected by the existence of Russia is driving the price down.", which is of course an effect on BTC whether you want to argue it's warranted or not. That's kind of a contradictory statement.

I don't see divisibility as a solution, that's assuming bitcoin REALLY takes off and things get priced down to satoshis. I just don't think that's realistic. 
You're not going to like the alternative, but hear me out:
The U.S. Gov issues cryptocurrency, backed by the federal government with losses covered by FDIC. There is no limit to the number printed, just like with Fiat. This makes a lot more sense to me. I can turn my 3 USD to 3 Bitcoins, buy something priced the exact same way as it is in USD, and the protocol should result in lower merchant fees. 
You'll frequently see bitcoiners talking about their value rising simply because coins were lost or seized. This isn't logical to anybody but a bitcoin owner, because it's supposed to simulate the loss of a finite resource like gold when BTC are arbitrarily finite.

...assuming the value doesn't crash. Then you're asking the employer to constantly re-evaluate pay. It's silly. 


Yes, it would. Billions of dollars in consumer spending would stop, and thousands of businesses would shutter. That simple incentive to not spend would greatly damage our economy. 


No, because there are no practical examples. The logic behind "money worth more tomorrow = don't spend today" is plenty.

No, they don't, and that's not what intrinsic value even means. You honestly don't even understand what you're talking about. Gold has intrinsic value **outside** its use as a store-of-wealth, nobody believes the industrial *intrinsic* uses of gold are the sole reasons for its value


BTC has no intrinsic properties, whether you think it "transcends" them or not (lol). Outside of transferring value, BTC has NO uses.

That's an alright question. We should be free to choose our method of commerce, I should be able to barter or trade if I want to.

Cryptos are great for two people in different countries who want to send "value" to each other
Cryptos could be great for microtransactions

I never said "exclusively". The bitcoin market swings wildly based on the newest retailer accepting it or country banning it. Supply and Demand has nothing to do with it right now, as supply is far exceeding demand (not counting bots that trade, obviously). 
The hysterical rise to $1200 wasn't based on limited supply, it was based on news of chinese adopters. Bitcoin prices rely almost entirely, but not exclusively, on news. The remainder is bots trading BTC, setting up buywalls so the perceived value never falls. I'm not stupid, this *is* how Bitcoin works whether you want to acknowledge it or not

This makes no sense. Are you talking about printing USD? That doesn't matter to TH or to the average daily coffee buyer. They would rather pay with tried-and-true cash than pay for some CoinKite card and then wonder what conversion fee they are paying.

Nah, I never said dozens. just like amex/visa/mc, I think there might be 1-3 major cryptocurrencies in use in the future, maybe one for riskless small transactions and a much safer, more expensive (but still less expensive than the banks) one for large, safe, reversible money transfers


Backing by the federal government, the status as official currency of the USD, and a general consensus that a $20 bill can buy you approximately $20 worth of goods and services.
Bitcoin has no backing, can't be used to pay your taxes, offers no protection or consumer security, and is partially valued based on an arbitrary limit and artificial scarcity not necessarily present in other coins, and certainly not necessary for its function.

I'm pretty sure "the market" has determined that Facebook is better than G+. The millions of myspace users couldn't stop Facebook from gaining popularity, and neither will the thousands of BTC users be able to prevent any other coin from gaining prominence.
Certainly some "user bases" have value. People pay for telemarketing lists, that doesn't really mean anything. The "network effect" that Bitcoin relies on isn't a guarantee of success, just like it wasn't a guarantee of success for Myspace. That's my entire point.

This isn't inconceivable at all. I frankly don't think many bitcoiners would disagree with me. Miners are overpaid, it shouldn't cost nearly $15 per transaction to process a payment network. I'm not trying to sound accusatory but you sound like you're white-knighting an industry that literally just wastes electricity. If they get compensated less then difficulty drops and they waste less electricity. *This* is the equilibrium, Bitcoin isn't a game of "let's make sure the miner's are rewarded ludicrously with $15/transaction or $1M+ per day" 


This, too, is amazingly shortsighted. Miners have bills to pay. When the music stops and people aren't willing to pay $400 a bitcoin they sell for $350, then $300. They aren't going to be racking up hundreds of thousands of dollars in electrical costs in some mexican standoff with bidders trying to extort some ridiculous profit margins out of hands for no reason other than arbitrary scarcity. 
Your whole argument is so....jesus christ I'll just bite my tongue. Miners don't run Bitcoin, the people willing to buy bitcoins from them do. Miners don't dictate the price, they take as much as they can get and that's it. And no point in time will miners ever stop paying their bills to play some ridiculous game of "pay me more for my super-scarce digital bucks that anybody else can just start mining anyway". If Bitcoin becomes a game of few miners unwilling to let go of coins for less than $900 each and people amazingly aren't willing to pay that then bitcoin loses it's value and utility and, surprise, there are already tons of altcoins waiting in the wings running on literally the same infrastructure with less greedy miners happy to process transactions.

Google "Patrick Byrne Bitcoin 1%" and it'll be in the first link. He estimated Bitcoin would be 1% of total sales...but more recently stated they were less than .1%. If he says they are rising 25%, he probably means they are now .125% of sales, which is still a huge drop from the beginning of this year. 
The math doesn't make sense if they made 1M in the first 2 months they should at least be past 2 M by now. Apparently bittime has a problem grasping these kind of figures though because what he heard must be true despite the figures provided by Patrick himself disagreeing

Joe public is your demand. A limited supply is totally irrelevant without demand. 
*edit* Your statement really belongs in some sort of Hall of Fame. I can picture a luxury brand CEO saying the same thing, except their product is actually desirable. 
What Joe Public is willing to pay means *everything*. It's the only thing that matters. What Joe Public is willing to pay **directly dictates your level of demand, you can't arbitrarily raise the price and assume Joe Public has a correlated increase in demand at that price simply because you've told him the supply is limited**. A limited supply is only valuable when it's actually respected, the limited supply of Bitcoins is about as well respected as a Limited Edition Ford Explorer. 


This is on the assumption that all mined bitcoins are being sold at market prices. This is a really terrible assumption. 


Supply is meeting demand at roughly $315 today. There is absolutely no promise or guarantee that a 50% drop in supply is going to result in a 100% increase in demand. None. 


This is still assuming that despite a falling price and stagnant transaction volumes there will continue to be a demand exactly equal to all the bitcoins mined each day up until the halving, and that all mined bitcoins are being sold at market value further reinforcing that value. I just don't think they are reasonable assumptions. Overall demand and public interest in bitcoins has been falling, I don't think that's questionable. it's not unreasonable to imagine that another nearly two years down the road there are plenty of early adopters selling out combined with the reduced block reward to satisfy the (lower) demand, not necessitating some ridiculous price doubling.

yes, there is. Blockchain already has functionality to show the price at the time you received a bitcoin, it's just a matter of legwork. Saying "but it's a lot of data!" is no excuse. 


This is easy: A merchant will provide them records, they'll see the $20,000 worth of shit you shipped to your home/business paid in BTC, and then you get audited


You can perform a transaction to show them you own the key they already know you own, or you can play stupid and likely face stiff fines more severe than your actual tax liabilities.

I'll respond to both of your paragraphs in reverse order, okay?
You're right. Bitcoin is great for making non-reversable, non-recurring payments with 0 customer protection for when that's applicable. That's literally the only value of bitcoin. You could argue it's worth $1 billion per bitcoin or $1, but that's why it has any applicability at all. Same for other alts. 
People don't like to pay in cash. That's literally why credit cards and debit cards became popular. The non-problem of a website storing my name and billing details when I pay for a video game is not at the forefront of the average consumers mind. I'd rather use a credit card to build credit, basically insure my purchase if it's defective and I need to chargeback an uncooperative vendor (never happened to me, why is this a bad thing?)

Both. You are liable for taxes on the Fair market value of the coin the moment you mine it, and then liable for gains/losses when you actually use the coin. You don't have to send the IRS check immediately after you mine a coin, but for each coin (or portion thereof) mined you should note the fair market value that day and pay taxes on that amount 
Same example as above: I mined a coin in November, bitcoins were worth a FMV of roughly $1000. I owe taxes on a gain of $1000. If I sold it that day, the value was roughly the same and I'm not due any more taxes. If I sold it the next day and it was worth $1100, I'm due taxes on another $100. If you waited until now and sold today, you'd have a capital loss of ~$500.

Only to Bitcoin owners with an inflated sense of self-worth. The vast and overwhelming majority of the population hasn't bought a cryptocoin and isn't biased (like you, no offense) towards BTC. If the "function" of a cryptocurrency can save merchants money ~~and negate oversight~~ it doesn't matter to people (except BTC owners) whether the coin is BTC or Doge or LTC, and in fact if people have heard "bad news about a coin theft" or similar, they heard it about **Bitcoin**. 
What's been in the news about DogeCoin lately? Oh, they sponsored an Olympic team and a NASCAR rather than recently lost $500M worth of speculative greed money, sure sounds like newbies /s
I predict within a few years we see one or two "top" coins, and then a handful of niche coins used among their market. Politely, due to all the negative press and speculative mania (now dying down), I don't think Bitcoin will retain  status. It'll still exist among diehard BTC fans, they may even still be willing to trade it for $500 each between themselves, but the majority of the NA/EU/AS population will be using OtherCoin and AnotherCoin. After this much bad press and deflation of hysteria, it's very unlikely BTC will rebound back to ATH's, let alone experience another 5x or 10x growth
Other coins without stories in the news about being 10% owned by thieves or known by the majority of non-BTC owners as "a scam" (62% in the most recent article I could find) have a higher likelihood to succeed and indeed prosper in the wake of BTCs fall, and indeed as a result of the lobbying done for merchants to accept *cryptocurrencies*, not just BTC.

Honest answers incoming
1. This is a huge problem. Bitcoin's low-cost model is only sustainable because it provides no costly customer security features. Once regulations have clamped down on Bitcoin, any cost savings to merchants will likely be negligible, and still with the added cost of complete lack of chargebacks for consumers, transaction fees for the customers
2. I've always thought this to be the bank's quick and simple solution to bitcoin. If Western Union simply lowered their fees they would eliminate one of bitcoin's best use-cases. Same for bank transfers. Consider that Google is allowing free email money transfers within the US. 
3. Microtransactions and very low-cost risk-free transactions (maybe like, buying a chocolate bar at the store). If microtransactions exploded in popularity they would totally clog the network.

You'd have a fair point, if not for all of these advances benefiting both BTC and every other alt. BitPay is one stop away from using Alts, so are the ATMs. Any steps Bitcoin clears in the path for cryptos, all other cryptos equally benefit from. I'm fairly confident most BTC-based businesses are prepared to switch to another coin if necessary. It's literally the same technology.


This is probably true, but strangely so. If this system is beneficial to merchants as-is, that extra infrastructure should be unnecessary and will only add costs and middlemen to what was intended to be a low-cost, no middle-man payment method

No, they aren't.


Life isn't a text-book case of supply and demand as you seem to think. Things aren't as black-and-white as scarcity=value. If another option exists, people can and will use it. The scarcity of "Bitcoins" is utterly irrelevant when calculating value. I mean, people do it all the time, but it's meaningless. Data isn't scarce, cryptocurrencies aren't scarce. 


Please tell me what you think the (roughly) the US inflation rate is, and then what you think my bank-account interest is. 


Those institutions have infinitely more oversight than Bitcoin "institutions", have insurances in the case of losses, and the bitcoin economy is essentially yearning for those kinds of things after Gox. 
Consumerism isn't a problem, in my opinion, especially if the solution is some deflationary economy where nobody spends and the economy withers. 


No, it can't. Bitcoins aren't proprietary or trademarked


**it's the same infrastructure**. If a merchant can accept Bitcoin via a QR code, literally every altcoin can work the exact same way, probably on the same equipment. It's trivial to accept altcoins. 


Tell that to MySpace


Laughably naive at this point. It is inconceivable to the average bitcoin owner that an alt could be successful so you get these scenarios where the "only likely option" is one where Bitcoin basically absorbs the altcoin. 
I'll say it again, there's no loyalty in the market for Bitcoins. If it can save merchants money and so can other alts, then they'll use whatever they need to. Talking about it as a deflationary system where you can store and grow your wealth is ridiculous, for all of the aforementioned problems with artificial (read: fake) scarcity

I don't think this is very likely. Overstock, probably the most prominent bitcoin site, only sees &lt;1% of their business in BTC. They can't offer 1% of their customers a discount. Do you know how quickly Visa/MC would threaten their licenses if they offered customers a discount for using a provider that cuts their grass? Stores don't eat the cost of credit card fees, they pass them on to the customer. If BTC saves merchants money that's great, but they want to pocket those meager savings, not give it to the customer.

Where are you going to have your item shipped?
What if the seller doesn't ship? Or ships a broken item? With Bitcoin you can't chargeback and you have no hope or seeing your money returned. Escrow isn't a solution, nobody is going to be willing to ship and wait for confirmation to get paid.

Ridiculous, over-the-top obvious crime like that which would only occur if literally all of the world's finances were conducted solely on the blockchain. But, alas, lots of business do off-chain transactions and essentially switch to using Excel for your Bitcoin balances, and nobody wants their bank account available for the public to see. I understand the pseudo-anonymity of bitcoin, but it's still a Con in my books to have everything publicized as such. I'd rather a centralized entity like a bank control my money and follow strict regulations wbookkeeping and money laundering. 
The obvious benefit to the blockchain is a complete transparency in the worlds finance, but this is not so even in the beginning stages of Bitcoin. The blockchain and what it was created for were bastardized the moment an off-chain transaction was allowed to occur

Yes, those fees are built into the prices, that's no mystery or surprise to anyone. It may somehow be a surprise to you that the general public don't mind paying this tiny surcharge for the convenience of using their cards and not carrying cash. 
Furthermore, bitcoin-accepting retailers like Overstock and TD aren't even offering discounts, you're still paying the built-in fees. It doesn't make much business sense to save money just to give it away, thus you aren't likely to see "paid-in-BTC" discounts anyway.

Bitcoin isn't a normal goods and the bitcoin market isn't a normal market. I cannot for the life of me figure out why people here think Bitcoin is a black-and-white example from a textbook and why a "limited supply" of an inherently unlimited good should ever affect the price. There's no shortage of cryptocoins, only of Bitcoins, and that scarcity is utterly irrelevant because it is totally artificial. People pay more for products because they're sold out or the retailer can't keep up with demand. There's barely any demand for bitcoins right now, and there's no realistic scenario of "running out". People can always use another less-finite crypto just as easily. 
There's one other item I can think of in which people have been tricked into overpaying for something not as scarce as they've been lead to believe...diamonds. Does anybody here actually think bitcoins can be sold to customers as well as DeBeers sold diamonds? Nobody respects nor should respect an artificial scarcity.

No, it isn't. Bitcoin doesn't have a monopoly on anything, just first-mover advantage. Competing alts have an immense opportunity to take advantage of the pathways bitcoin has carved while adjusting itself to better suit the current economy. 
Perhaps you'll need to point out to me how the utility has improved. The price appreciation from before a major retailer was accepting bitcoin to after was negligible and has since been lost. It's the same technology now that it will be in a couple months, barring minor changes. They aren't changing the supply limit, they aren't introducing chargebacks, so the value hasn't (and won't) realistically or significantly change
Calling right now a "golden opportunity" for investment is just shameful. Thousands of people are losing millions of dollars as we speak over Gox and you're already spouting off about how it's gonna make people rich.

*and*? It's a relatively utterly trivial amount of work. A couple hours for some coders to support a likely billion-dollar economy. See what I mean? I'm not trying to be snarky, you're bringing up utterly tiny barriers to entry that are so small as to be nonexistent. 


Mandating their own crypto into law would go hand-in-hand with international use. If people can use it interchangeably with USD, adoption would be so fast your head would spin, especially if merchants could count on a majority of customers using it and pay their suppliers in combinations of USD and Coin. 


**It's the same infrastructure**. The costs are relatively trivial. 


There is no costs to these people, they're simply waiting for a company (possibly CoinKite themselves) to produce alt-acceptance options. **Merchants already accept multiple coins**. Any costs involved are to a company like "FedCoinPay", who would obviously quickly recoup costs providing they're making (smaller than Visa) merchant services fees


That's wonderful. I wish you would stop repeating yourself anyway and actually think about the topic with a bit more of an open mind. The "barriers to entry" for a FedCoin would be so minimal and the "pushback" from users so miniscule that bitcoin would be dead virtually overnight. 
edit: Oh look, there's already a multi-crypto ATM in the works:
and Revel system adds Bitcoin to their iPad point-of-sale service. I'm sure the costs of them incorporating FedCoin or any other successful coin are SO ENORMOUS that they could never possibly do that. 
and apparently there was *already* a BitPay-equivalent that worked with multiple cryptos, but they are closing at the end of this month. I'm sure nobody else will take their place, ever.

Are you stupid?
If part of this exchange is losing $5 per BTC while the transaction occurs, that -$5 is a certain percentage. If I'm transferring more than one BTC, that $5 per BTC loss might be $20, or $50, I might lose $100 in BTC value while the transaction processes. 
Is -$100 the same percentage as -$5? Are you really this dense? Jesus christ 
Exchange fees are X%
miner fees are Y%
volatility losses/gains are Z%, this is a portion of the other two. You aren't even reading the example you're so quick to blurt out your own stupidity. If you don't understand the topic just shut the fuck up about it lest you continue to make yourself look stupid

Why bother mentioning this at all? Nobody cares about the cost for Bitcoiners to change to FedCoin. Need I remind you that more than 99.9% of the US hasn't touched a crypto? There exchange fees you pay for buying bitcoins would presumably be the same as for buying FedCoins, why do you think that's going to be significantly and prohibitively higher? 


You're kidding right? "These facts are not proof of anything!" If merchants are using multiple coins, then the costs are obviously not prohibitive. 


The fact you need "evidence" that a government-backed, merchant forced USD coin would pass Bitcoin is sheer proof of how biased you are towards bitcoin, and how closed-minded you are.


No. Any assumptions I make are totally reasonable(merchants already accept multiple coins, they could easily accept a FedCoin), yours are just laughable (Bitcoin will retain value simply because Bitcoin owners don't want another coin to overtake them)

Bitcoin's ability to change and adapt is limited. Despite all of the flaws I hear about (long confirmation times, miniscule transaction limit per second) none of them have been issues fixes. Momentum means very little once one cryptocurrency has proven itself superior to Bitcoin. It's incredibly easy to imagine a real-world example in which an altcoin replaces Bitcoin: one that can complete more than 7 transactions per second, or doesn't rely on users storing petabytes worth of blockchain data. Talk about pruning or improvements if you like, but none of that has happened yet.

Satoshi owns *1 million bitcoins*, other early investors comprise roughly another 40 percent of available bitcoins. There's definitely a small peak to this "pyramid"


Again, not true. Many people believe a rising price is dependent on many users (it isn't, but people think it is)


Rehashing here, but indeed people assume that the more people using bitcoins, the more demand, the higher the price. 
The reason OP sees people calling Bitcoin a ponzi are for the above-mentioned reasons. It stands on its own as a useful form of payment transfer, but when people start shouting about $10,000 Bitcoins it starts to look like a scam
again, remember, $10,000 BTC's are necessary **ever**. BTC will function just as well staying at $500 or dropping to $100. Talking about moon prices just sketches people out.

0 confirmation spends aren't acceptable. Double-spending is trivially easy. No exaggerating, I have 7 Tim Horton's locations in my relatively small town, each drive-through lane is packed around the corner each and every morning and most of all day.  It took Tim Horton's years and years to accept debit and credit cards, which for most transactions take all of five seconds. There's absolutely no way Tim Horton's is considering a payment method in which it takes up to or more than ten minutes to have a confirmed payment. 
Like, I'll bet a thousand fucking US dollars that you won't see Tim Horton's using CoinKite this year. Anybody? This is just the dumbest goddamn rumor I've read and clearly was created by somebody not even remotely familiar with TH's business. 
oh, and in Canada (where I live, and where Tim Horton's is based) "Interac" debit transactions don't cost 4% or even 2%, they are a flat-fee 5c per transaction. Paying coinkite would actually lower their bottom line. I'm still laughing at how stupid this idea is.

I'm sure you're in no position to definitively state that there could never be a cryptocurrency with some sort of chargeback feature. In any case, if chargebacks or reversals can't be implemented then bitcoin (and indeed cryptos) have a markedly limited use in riskless, trustless transactions.

I don't understand the need to correct me. I should have said "several months", but my original point was that Bitcoin, which did in fact grow 1000x over the course of several months, enjoyed growth it couldn't possibly sustain. I've never seen such outrageous, annoying pedantry anywhere else. 
Like, it didn't happen within two months (at least $1-$1000 didn't) but Bitcoin did increase 1000x, so why bother "correcting" me on something I'm not even wrong about? Is it *that* important that you clarify I understand the difference between "couple" and "several"?

That discussion honestly doesn't need to be had. Bitcoin doesn't "work" to replace the US Dollar. Lending isn't feasible. Bitcoin will always be a novelty and anybody even remotely informed about the limitations of the technology would agree that it simply wouldn't stand up to even a small fraction of US Commerce. Bitcoin would grind to a half if it even had 25% of a SINGLE U.S. credit card company's business. This doesn't include the 2 other major credit card companies, banks, loans, mortgages. We're talking about commerce several orders of magnitude higher than Bitcoin is able to handle.

 &gt; Inflation is the aspect that keeps the poor of this country from ever attaining anything because their money is worth less in the future than it is today. *They are forced to spend it instead of saving for the future* when they will need it and it often times increases debt. Bitcoin, as you have pointed out is deflationary, which can encourage the average American to save for things in the future. Bitcoin can act as an investment, much like the stock market, which by your argument would also be detrimental to the US economy
Have you never heard of savings accounts, savings bonds, GICs? Inflation *encourages* people to save and invest in the economy, not necessarily spend it immediately 
Simply holding on to a currency shouldn't be an investment vehicle, it encourages no growth to the economy and you're completely naive as to the economical impact of that kind of currency. It *would* be detrimental to the economy, nobody wants to spend money when it's worth more tomorrow. 


You really think Overstock is working on the bitcoin protocol? Chargebacks will never be in bitcoin, it's against what bitcoin was made for.

You do have to pay taxes twice, whether they are capital gains or not I'm not sure. If you mined 1 BTC today, you're liable for taxes (at some rate) on roughly $580 immediately. If bitcoin grows to $600 by the time you spend it, you're liable for taxes on that $20 gain immediately. 
You're liable for taxes on mining profits immediately in the same way for income tax immediately, people just don't remit their taxes but once a year. 


You have to pay taxes twice, the second tax (at point-of-sale or cashout) could be a loss, but there's still a potential for two taxes. I'm not positive whether or not the tax on mined coins is considered "capital gains" but it makes sense to me that it would be

Infrastructure and adoption have been going up all year and the price declined more than 50%. The price of bitcoin isn't directly related to the number of users or the "infrastructure". 


If it's so simple please show the correlation between the number of users and the price of Bitcoin. Do we have half the users we had last year at this time? I think you'll find the determination of the price of a bitcoin isn't "really really simple math"


We've had a whole year of gradual organic losses, why exactly is this going to magically turn around? Bitcoin at it's current price has a 4 billion dollar market cap and less than 1 billion dollars worth of economic activity going on at any point. I could agree that the price could rise based on user adoption but there's no relation to the current price and number of users. We could very well see the price drip down to the $100's or lower before it starts the gradual organic rise you're talking about

Here's some light reading for you:


RIM's early development was financed by Canadian institutional and venture capital investors in 1995 through a private placement in the privately held company. Working Ventures Canadian Fund Inc. led the first venture round[12] with a C$5,000,000 investment with the proceeds being used to complete the development of RIM's two-way paging system hardware and software. A total of C$30,000,000 in pre-IPO financing was raised by the company prior to its initial public offering on the Toronto Stock Exchange in January 1998 under the symbol RIM.[13]
The company worked with RAM Mobile Data and Ericsson to turn the Ericsson-developed Mobitex wireless data network into a two-way paging and wireless e-mail network. Pivotal in this development was the release of the Inter Pager 950, which started shipping in August 1998. About the size of a bar of soap, this device competed against the SkyTel two-way paging network developed by Motorola.
Tell me again how Blackberry wasn't successful until kids starting buying them you complete fucking idiot. I  guess the $292 MILLION DOLLARS they made in 2002 wasn't very successful. Nobody knew what a Blackberry was then, no sir.

Unfortunately nobody is going to care about your experiment. Bitcoins may be "impossible" to steal via brute-force but that doesn't mean hundreds of people haven't had BTC stolen from them via other means. The government has also seized Bitcoins from several individuals already. 
My point isn't that Bitcoins aren't secure, they are, but there's a dozen avenues to get a hold of somebody's bitcoins that don't involve guessing their private keys. The technology is secure, the software and websites catering to it are not. 
edit - I'm also thinking for some reason somebody has suggested this exact thing before, though I can't seem to find it. Another thing to consider is that because of the blockchain the wallet address of some of the wealthiest individuals in the BTC world are known, there's a lot more incentive to crack those wallets than yours. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 23:28:01
You're right, and that's why BTC has any niche use at all. There are unbanked people in the world who could potentially use bitcoin (or something like it with more security) in the future. 
The number of people who "hate big banks" and would ever say "banksters" is tiny. Microscopic. A spec of the financial industry. Those people should use bitcoin if it suits their needs, but it's awfully stupid for those same people to claim that bitcoin will take over the modern banking industry when it's a very small fraction of the population that agrees with their anti-government, anti-regulation, anti-trust values
A great glaring example of this is both chargebacks and personal info. If you ask a bitcoiner they will frequently claim that chargebacks are a big issue for merchants, but they simply aren't. The benefits of using bitcoin don't currently outweight the benefits of using a credit card with consumer protection features. Bitcoiners seem to think that 50% of retail customers chargeback products just for fun. In reality it's much less than 1%. Likewise, bitcoin owners seem to think that the miniscule benefit of not sharing personal info with merchants is so valuable that it outweighs ALL consumer protection features, and it's better to use a currency that could be irreversibly stolen than potentially have Gamestop know my address. I don't think I need to tell you that isn't a fair trade-off for consumers.

You're obviously unwaveringly biased towards Bitcoin and lack common sense if you think the government is responsible for uninsured losses outside their scope of business. 
The government didn't force anybody to use Bitcoin, let alone use Bitcoin at a foreign exchange that offered no proof of solvency. It's outlandish for anybody to lay blame anywhere but with themselves and Gox.

The money into and people involved with Bitcoin is so different this time around that I don't think the two events can be compared at all. We'll have to wait and see. Miners' weren't being compensated anywhere near the same amount of money when the block reward was twice what it is today but the price was only $10 or $50 bucks. 


These aren't mutually exclusive. 


Except the $30 you put into Bitcoin could just as easily be $30 into whatevercoin. As much as the price doesn't matter neither does the network, a cryptocurrency is a cryptocurrency. For functional purposes short-term "investments' into Bitcoins indeed make the price irrelevant but you're not really talking about that, you're talking about miners holding their mined Bitcoins hostage for $x000 each when the same functionality can be found in any other altcoin, and don't kid yourself into thinking other altcoins wouldn't see the same use if the aforementioned hostage situation were to occur. You're painting a picture that it's no big deal to offer continuously-increasing rewards to miners simply for running their computers and wasting electricity and processing an absolutely meager amount of transactions and that's total nonsense. 
I'll spell this out for you as clearly as I can - the general public won't be "duped" into the artificial scarcity you're so eager to buy into. There's a certain level of open market demand for Bitcoins at $300 and probably quite a bit more support of under the table trading support at $100-$200 but there's no fucking reaosn whatsoever that John Public will be forced to pay exhorbitant and unnecessary "scarcity costs" for a digital and inherently non-scarce cryptocurrency. It won't happen. People aren't that stupid. If PayPal or Western Union today claimed their overhead had increased by 50% and they were expecting people to pay double you earnestly believe those customers wouldn't look elsewhere? Bitcoin isn't any different and it isn't a matter of Bitcoin being proprietary or the only game in town where your argument might hold some water. 


Of course I know this. You completely missed my point. Bitcoin is arbitrarily limited to 21 million units. It's an artificial scarcity, just an arbitrary limit to a number of non-physical units that are by their very nature infinite. Data is for all intents and purposes infinite. There is no limited number of web page accesses for the internet or limited number of emails, convincing people that there is a limited number of Bitcoins (though true) and that is somehow inherently valuable is a fool's errand. You can convince libertarians and goldbugs but you can't convince the general public you're counting on paying double for some bullshit they'll never buy when other options exist and will be heavily advertised


More people have seen The Smurfs 2 than participate in The Bitcoin Economy. The network effect bitcoin currently enjoys is negligible in the big picture of things


Then why can't you sell all yours for $1200 today? 


Let's examine a few reasons why somebody would buy $2000 worth of Bitcoin
As a store of value - Bitcoin lost roughly 60% in 2014. It's a poor store of value for any recent users and this trend may continue through 2015 and into the halving. 


I bolded the part you need to read over a few times to really see how out of touch with reality you are at this point. Who cares what the average person thinks? Who cares about the functionality to the average person? The average person is the guy you're counting on putting that $2000 into Bitcoin and they arent doing it as a store of value. Maybe they're doing it for remittances. Maybe Litecoin can do the same remittance for a fraction of what Bitcoins cost because Litecoin miners aren't greedy like Bitcoin miners? All that's missing is a LiteCoinPay and for Circle to implement Litecoin and the miners can ruin Bitcoin for all anybody cares, VC companies like LitecoinPay and Circle would still make their cut on the cryptocurrency du jour. 
I'm going to bed now but holy shit you've given me a good chuckle tonight. Who cares what Average Joe thinks or cares! He'll pay whatever we say for bitcoins because of the super-limited supply! After all there's no way any functionally-identical technology can be overtaken by a competitor!
Imagine Bitcoin is MySpace and they suddenly decide they are running out of pages and so instead of paying $1 for your own page you can now pay $10 to have part of another guy's. You still get the same content, just a smaller resolution. There's no difference right? please don't sign up at Facebook! Network effect!

Wrong. The guidelines say he is liable to taxes on the value of that coin at the moment it was mined, and then also liable for capital gains/losses on the difference in price between when it was mined and sold.
If you mined a Bitcoin @ 1200 USD you owe taxes on 1200 and can file a loss for the drop from 1200 to 600

Actually, add that to the list of "reasons Bitcoins are great for criminals", you can steal money and then use that same money to buy goods without repercussions. Some lucky guy is using all of your BTC to buy bedsheets and jewellery from Overstock and there's nothing anybody can do about it.

This doesn't illustrate any of the benefits of Bitcoin though. Your rugs might as well be WoW gold, or Farmville points. If Bitcoin is so revolutionary there's shouldn't be a need for an intermediary that collects a profit while offering the merchant *none* of the benefits of Bitcoins. 
It's really bizarre to me that people are excited about this. Before it was "merchants are getting crushed by CC fees" but once there's a way to spend bitcoins nobody gives a remote fuck about that anymore.

See, you're talking about stocks as if they are a currency. There's no relation. I'm not expecting people to be able to redeem their limited Apple shares for food and rent. The logic is very clear: Bitcoins have an artificial scarcity, and there is absolutely 0 value to their scarcity without some sort of proprietary function. Bitcoin isn't trademarked, basically. Who gives a shit if the world is running out of buyable bitcoins when you can buy one of a hundred different altcoins that can accomplish the same thing. Artificial scarcity isn't valuable unless that item is unique and somehow "special", Bitcoin is neither of those things compared to any other alt.

People have been waiting a while for retailers to accept bitcoin, it's not surprising that day-1 or month-1 sales are high. That doesn't mean anything for sustainability. People spent BTC to try and up the value, I'm willing to bet BTC sales at both TD and O.co have dropped considerably

Bitcoin owners would like you to believe the value should rise so high that eventually small amounts of bitcoin (satoshis) are used for everyday items, and a single bitcoin is worth a house, or several hundred thousand dollars. This is the solution offered rather than changing the arbitrary limit of 21M to a different number based on some sort of logic or statistics. 
Also raising the limit would devalue everybody's current "investments" and nobody here is interested in losing money either. 
People that argue in favor of keeping the 21M limit are more interested in bitcoins as a "hold and get rich" scheme than as a functional and useful store of value or currency
Other coins have recognized 21M as a potentially low arbitrary number of total supply and have a higher limit (84M coins in Litecoin) or no limit (Dogecoins, currently)

Hindsight is 20/20. You might theoretically have done better by waiting 15 minutes, but there's no guarantee the coin isn't just going to drop more and then you'll be wishing you waited even longer.

There's nothing specific in their ToS about a specific time period, but I've seen other exchanges with similar rules that if you are inactive for 60 days or 3 months or whatever they'll close your account and collect the balance as a charge.

If you want to keep thinking that actual people are demanding to pay $600 for Bitcoins right now rather than just less and less that's fine, but you're kidding yourself, that's not reality.

You aren't paying 3% less, the price is the same for you whether you pay in Bitcoin or with a credit card (except the trans fee you pay with BTC). 
I've never had to reverse a charge either. I'm not sure why proponents of bitcoin here seem to think it happens to +25% of retail purchases. 
You might not feel like you need insurance, but the vast and overwhelming majority do. As I mentioned, it doesn't cost the user anything extra unless they pay an annual fee. I don't. 


It's not about being careless man. Even the best of us can end up getting scammed some time. Reversibility is absolutely essential in commerce, nobody wants to be left with nothing because they felt they could protect themselves when a perfectly serviceable alternative exists and has existed for decades.

It's really funny that everytime any new bitcoin thing comes out there's like six threads about this exact same topic. 
Sidechains? Does this mean altcoins are dead?
Colored coins? Does this mean altcoins are dead? 
it's like you people don't understand the concept of competition. Bitcoin is embraced by an absolutely tiny amount of people relative to the population. The rest of the world has no allegiance and very well may use something other than Bitcoin. There's no real reason that Bitcoin is "best", it's massively inefficient for a system that handles 1 transaction per second right now, has an arbitrary 21 million limit of which ~10% is already lost or stolen, the list of issues (and reasons for the existence of competition) goes on and on. 


As per usual, no.

Well, yes there is. You literally cannot print more bitcoins than are allotted, nor can you counterfeit them.

Holy mother of god, someone actually said this. The sheer stupidity is astounding.


Doubling down, I see. Bitcoins aren't any different than any other altcoin, therefore it *isn't* inherently special. The name has been dragged through the mud so much that alts like Litecoin have a great chance at success, nearing equal to Bitcoin's limited chances. People can trust bitcoin mathematics just the same as Litecoin or Dogecoin mathematics, any 10x increase in bitcoin prices wouldn't be a result of increased functionality or safety, it would just be a larger tax for using the brand-name Bitcoin, something people aren't likely to do. There's no "Premium USD" that costs 1.5 USD to buy but works exactly like 1 USD, if you can understand that analogy.

You've paid me money for a piece of paper with random numbers on it that I assure you are valuable and will grow in value. At this point, only the buyer and seller are in agreement on the value, not the U.S. Government. If people experience losses on the "value" of those random numbers because of bad news or general loss of "faith", the Government isn't going to afford a single penny of tax benefits to people who thought it was wise to "invest" their dollars in random data with supposed value.

Really, really pathetic shilling.

See that group, second from the left, called "The Greater Fools"? That represents 281/500 Gox accounts that were analyzed. Those 281 particular people bought Bitcoins with "the highest faith" at the absolute highest price point. For those people, bitcoin has chopped their money in half. It has not repaid those people, and it likely never will. Those 280 represent a small portion of people who are in a similar situation, as you can imagine there are thousands more who paid $1000, or $800, or $600. They have all lost money on those BTCs. 
Now read this


and tell me if anything sounds similar. There's nothing propping the price up except your hopes and dreams that people will continue to pay more and more for your bitcoins rather than just stop using them and use another crypto. They function the same.

Reversible payments is a good thing in modern commerce, for some reason bitcoiners suffer from the misconception that consumers don't want this. Just today some poor 14-year old send all his Bitcoins to the wrong address and they are lost forever, this isn't a good thing or a "pro". Commerce is supposed to be easy, not punish users for small mistakes by ridding them of their life savings 


Bitcoin suffers the same vulnerability, another misconception. The government has already frozen/seized BTC addresses, businesses (exchanges) are happy to comply with this. 


and Bitcoin is worth half as much as it was just three or four months ago. Also, regular people don't care about inflation, it encourages economic stimulation and investment, this tirade against inflation is a libertarian affair.

This doesn't make a lot of sense. The USD served as a fine store of value this year didn't it? I'm a Canadian and my plain old savings account didn't do too badly against inflation. You can't make blanket statements like "inflation = no store of value" because inflation is effectively controlled and there are plenty of USD-based investments that outpace it the USD, an inflationary currency, is a fine store of value. 


It makes fine sense if you buy bitcoin and spend it immediately. No volatility risk and you stimulate the economy. Stimulation is very important


In an extreme example Warren Buffet could issue himself 21M BuffetCoins valued at a locked $400 each and never ever use them. Is this a better currency than Bitcoin simply because it represents a higher amount of wealth? I don't think you can logically argue it is. 


This is ridiculous. Transactions are a good thing, there's absolutely no reason to "slow down" when Bitcoin is only at a meager &gt; 1 transaction per second on average


Oh yeah that's why people post so many holding charts and not a chart every week about how transaction volume is rising /s

There's a lot more people who know of (and/or trust) WU than "Bitcoin". A trusted name in business is instant incentive to use a product, and would also instantly provide a feeling of security that Bitcoin doesn't resound. 


The VC is obviously all behind bitcoin. The ATMs accept Bitcoin, and mostly Bitcoin is pushed on retailers. This isn't because of some proprietary value to Bitcoins, it's just by virtue of being first and having the most investors behind it as a result. 
They run on the same technology. Bitcoin ATMs could be changed to service other alts rather trivially, same goes for retail POS. Multi-crypto POS units are already in production, and a recent UK survey posted here on r/bitcoin indicated more than 50% of responding merchants either already accepted multiple cryptos, or would in the future 
Major retailers can accept Litecoin just as easily as Bitcoin, but everybody is still pushing Bitcoins. I firmly believe all tech companies making Bitcoin terminals are ready to switch to alts as soon as the tides change, same with VC investors. This is a whole other strange issue as the price of a cryptocoin doesn't matter, but that's for a whole other thread.

This isn't sustainable. Bitcoins aren't limited, only bitcoins are. There has already been so many issues with bitcoins being lost and being stolen, the economy is 10% owned by scammers. The recent decline in bitcoin price after a hysterical rise is an obvious indication of a loss of faith. 
I respect the gamble you're taking, I sincerely doubt it will pay off in the way you hope it does. You're counting on someone to pay you a multiple of what you paid for some computer data, a protocol of money exchange in which the price of the "units of transfer" (bitcoins in this case) are utterly meaningless to the function of the exchange. 


Bitcoins are a technological breakthrough, but that doesn't necessitate each individual bitcoin to be worth multiple-thousand USD. The same technology is alive and well in altcoins, functioning essentially the same, and living practical proof that the function exists separate of the price. 
There's absolutely no logic behind another skyrocket, or even a steady increase in BTC price. The demand isn't there, the supply limit is a meaningless selling point that adds a touch of ponzi scheme and get-rich-quick-for-hoarding-a-file-on-a-computer. That's a strange bet to me, but suit yourself

Yes, it did, but with **no liability**


Yes, it seems many people *mistakenly* assumed Gox had some actual legal obligation to protect their balances. Unfortunately, Gox isn't a bank and....


Read the Terms. The answer is yes. 


L-M-A-O. It's not my opinion, that's what it says. Black and white. How clients interpret that plain english statement that says they have 0 liability is irrelevant, they agree to those terms by using the site and those terms included "protection" but with no actual obligation to protect.

Based on the limited reading I've been doing on this topic, it seems to be banned because bitcoin trading is not strictly legal in every country that the app is available in.

It is important, assuming bitcoins were more popular and there was enough activity in the economy to justify a higher market cap, obviously it makes sense to have one. The problem lies in bitcoin's artificial scarcity. Any large market cap also commands a large per-bitcoin price (necessitating increasing the wealth of early adopters), but this is inherently unnecessary when other cryptos can have 42M coins, or infinite coins. They can achieve the same, or higher, market cap than Bitcoin without increasing the wealth of a select few early adopters and the 10% of bitcoins owned by thieves and scammers.

I'm saying Bitcoin infrastructure (ATMS, POS units) can easily be adapted to suit other cryptos (if necessary). Gains for bitcoin (in terms of getting into stores of being accepted by retailers) are gains for all Bitcoins, but bad news stories about bitcoin are absorbed by bitcoin alone.

You don't understand how business works. You don't take risks on volatile alternative currencies, you cash out to fiat ASAP and don't risk a single penny. Shareholders don't care if the CEO believes in BTC, they don't want to lose revenue/profits thanks to bitcoin's continual downtrend. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 04:45:26
A couple things...


This is kinda ridiculous. I'm sure when using bitcoin you were still prompted for an email, subscribing to a mailing list, and adding (payment) details. The only other thing you mentioned was security, which is something people *want*. Credit card fraud is financially covered, it's not something people worry about constantly, and not a major reason to use bitcoin. Also bitcoin forces a transaction fee on the user as well as the merchant, and there is presumably still tax implications on bitcoin purchases, so it's not quite like "paying in digital cash"
Second, you're talking to a regulator like bitcoin is going to take over and contribute to the US financial system. bitcoin was essentially created as a tax evasion mechanism, and is being praised as such by many of its users who don't want the government in their business AT ALL.  
@_date: 2014-03-21 16:58:11
Haha wow only a 5% fee, what a bargain. 
@_date: 2014-03-25 14:40:05
It's a common opinion, though. People think their bitcoins should appreciate simply for their unrealized infinite potential, not based on actual utility value or user adoption. 
Perhaps the majority of people understand they have to use bitcoins for people to see the utility, unfortunately they still (mostly) don't spend them. It's a holding economy, and a holding economy won't prosper like it would if there were PR cases like Dogecoin and NASCAR right now

You didn't count the miner's fee, nor any costs the person receiving bitcoin incurs converting that money to fiat. Also, what's the price you pay for bitcoins on coinbase? I'm sure there's more than a 35 cent markup there. Not to mention the significant amount of time it would take a new person to be able to register and buy bitcoins at Coinbase. 
I think my point is sufficiently proven. 
edit: another significant factor: had this imaginary transaction taken place within the last 2 hours the recipient would have lost roughly $50 per bitcoin by the time they cash out. Wal-Mart transfers are immune to volatility, so is Western Union, Paypal, banks, and most every other common financial transfer tool.

@_date: 2014-03-30 04:54:15


Hahaha. No, it wouldn't. A billion people could use cryptocoins and that doesn't mean they're going to be all using bitcoins at million dollars each. All your data is based on the entire world adopting a cryptocurrency already owned 10% by thieves and tarnished with a terrible reputation over simply any other Bitcoin out there. It's preposterous. There's no real correlation between adoption rates and price, people jumped on board in big numbers because there was a mania in effect, and that hype is over. The price isn't going up another 10x, the demand for bitcoin in particular as a currency is rather in the toilet right now.

Yes. Merchants will disclose their sales figures for both USD and BTC. It's very simply for an IRS agent to look at those records, see the big spenders, and then check if those big spenders have been declaring their taxes. If you spend $1000 at TD you probably don't have much to worry about. If you spent $50,000 on Overstock last year and didn't file a penny in Bitcoin income, you're fucked. 


Basically this. The IRS created those guidelines obviously as a way of crippling Bitcoin commerce. The onerous requirements are 100% intentional. You'd better believe there's IRS agents reading reddit, seeing all the people talking about evading taxes or playing stupid, and salivating all over their keyboard

Lol. The counter-argument is "intrinsic value isn't real" and "Bitcoin is backed by the network". Those are both terrible arguments that hand-waive away the true criticisms.

@_date: 2014-02-16 19:59:04
You have no idea what you're talking about. You need regulations to make sure money exchangers have an obligation to secure your funds, have capital to provide insurance for losses, all kinds of other things. Since these regulations don't exist, there's no law requiring Mt.Gox to secure funds or provide insurance for losses caused by negligence. 
You can claim Gox stole your Bitcoins, but so what? Where did they agree they would securely store them? Where did they agree they are liable for losses?
You have no idea how little protection the law affords to this type of thing. Again, it was mentioned at the NYS DoF hearings, there's no consumer protection for bitcoins. You buy internet funbucks, leave them at the internet funbank, and hope for the best. If things go south, there's no recourse, no compensation.

Funny enough, I'm about as anti-police as they come.

I already admitted that police occasionally lie, to act like it's something that happens a majority of the time or that it happened in this case is pretty stupid, but if you have evidence that they made it up I'd love to hear it. 
Ironically, you're calling me a sheep while defending a guy who mindlessly assumes (like yourself) that police testimony is falsified because he isn't happy about the story. I expect when more details are released and it wasn't, in fact, a lie that I'm owed an apology, but I doubt you or coqui33 will provide one

Like Beanie Babies and Pogs, right? You're completely wrong here, the general public doesn't care about the "scarcity" of computer data and never will. If Bitcoins/Altcoins can save merchants money, *that's* the function and the value right there. People aren't flocking to buy Bitcoins as some magical way to make money. The only way your bitcoins increase in value is when you convince someone else to pay more for them, not because of an increase in utility or function, they work the same. 


Have you never heard of a savings account or making an investment?
I'm not going to reply to each of your earlier posts, but you seem to think that the arbitrary scarcity is somehow a necessity to the function when it isn't. Dogecoins have no limit and yet they could potentially work the same, all that's missing is a merchant and DogePay. 
It's ludicrous to propose that people will somehow, magically significantly increase their wealth simply by hoarding and holding on to arbitrarily and artificially scarce computer data. You're kidding yourself if you think that's something the general public will ever buy into. If people are going to use BTC or alts it will be on the merits of their function, not as some ridiculous scheme to make money year-over-year by simply holding on to it, that's not conducive to a successful economy *at all*

No, it went to $1000 based on news from China. If it were because people were buying it more, the price would still be high. Supply is limited after all, right? 
I'm not going any further here, it's glaringly evident you have an elementary understanding of how supply and demand works. Items worth $1000 each don't drop to half that value three months later. If they did, there was never any real demand, and the limited supply obviously doesn't matter to anybody if it hasn't maintained a high ask price.

The economy and current banking infrastructure already helps people preserve (via insured savings), create (via insured bonds and other savings vehicles, loans) and "free up" (whatever that means) their wealth. 
I agree, the blockchain is the invention.

So why buy bitcoins? This isn't a get-rich-quick scheme. You missed a "lower low" last week at $375 and I predict we'll be that low (or even lower) again in a little while. I could be wrong, bitcoin could rebound a little bit, but don't expect to get back to $1000 and double your cash. It's unlikely. The speculative hype of bitcoins is dead.
Ask yourself: Why would anybody buy my bitcoins for more money tomorrow than I spent on them today? There's 3600 new ones being made every day and nowhere near that kind of demand. 
Keep in mind several weeks ago LOTS of people here thought $700 was a great price...and then $600 was a great price. Anybody who bought bitcoins this year has lost money, don't expect anything different from your "investment" and don't be surprised when, in a few weeks, $300 is a "great price"

Also, Amazon recently had a high-paid job posting for a cryptocurrency-type job that openly mocked Bitcoin in the ad. They're creating their own payment transfer service, not using one other people already own and created.

Sure. If you "stored your value" last year I can see why. If you "stored your value" this year you've lost money. It's not a reasonable store of value right now, though when volatility decreases that could change. 
Using bitcoin as a store of value is fine, if you can stand the risk. That doesn't necessitate a $100,000 BTC. You can store your value in BTC just fine at $100/BTC or even $10/BTC. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 18:51:41
No, because coinbase isn't an alternative to **credit**, not to mention the cashback/travel points that a lot of CC providers afford. 
Also Bitcoin isn't in any way comparable to Paypal. It may be "cheaper", but if you get ripped off with BTC your money is GONE, whereas Paypal can refund your money quite easily.

You're got a deep, ignorant bias. You don't think Myspace was saying "Maybe in 100 years we'll have a competitor!".

Here's a no-bullshit answer for you: Yes, absolutely. There's absolutely no reason why bitcoin mining needs to be so impactful in terms of energy costs. Other alt coins are produced with less hashing power or premined.

@_date: 2014-03-03 22:41:08


I'm fearful you're just going to scoff at any "reasons", however valid, but here goes:
Arbitrarily low supply - Satoshi owns a million, and 10% are owned by thieves/stolen. Another large unknown percentage is owned by early adopters. When the day comes (if ever) that Bitcoins run scarce, and I'm now supposed to pay a premium because there's a low supply (for aforementioned reasons), myself and everybody else (general public) is going to say "fuck that" and use a more "available" alt. You don't understand how little respect the general public has for an artificial supply in combination with massive holdings by early adopters
Bad reputation - The masses haven't used Bitcoin, but they've sure heard bad news about it. If a coin can gain publicity (let's use Litecoin), offering merchants the same benefits but without the terrible reputation (robberies, scams, etc), that's a massive reason for the general public to use one over the other. 
Any combination of transaction time improvements, safety features, environmental impact, social benefit - We've both read countless stories of people waiting for transaction to confirm, losing money where traditional banking could have saved them, wasting hundreds on electricity to print a dollar worth of BTC, and the complaints of hashing having no social value. Any coin that can better protect its users, prevent theft, discourage hoarding, encourage spending, confirm faster, have a more efficient blockchain or otherwise benefit humanity (think Folding @ home vs. "network security")
There, you have probably about a dozen obvious and valid reasons why people would switch to another alt. You're so narrow-minded and biased that I bet you have some ridiculous illogical but but but argument for each

While you're having epiphanies...


You've got to consider that, alternatively, there's no benefit gained from bitcoin that you can't easily benefit from using Dogecoin. Though a ridiculous parody, their donation efforts and continued presence should serve as a reminder that Bitcoin is one of many. The network effect Bitcoin enjoys is no guarantee of success, and the roads Bitcoin has paved into retail via companies like BitPay, CoinKite or the ATMs can easily be adapted to serve other coins if necessary. 
As a result, there's no appreciable difference to the two. Bitcoin owners believe scarcity in some computer data has value but if unlimited Dogecoins can function the same there's no real value there, and no loyalty for coins among the 99.999% of the world who hasn't even considered using a crypto.
The value of cryptocurrencies is in their function, not some artificial scarcity-derived value. Either Dogecoins and Litecoins are seriously undervalued or Bitcoins are seriously overvalued

That's irrelevant to the discussion at hand. *potential fraud* is unacceptable to everybody that doesn't own bitcoins and think they are the best thing since the Internet was invented. Doublespending and chargebacks aren't the same thing, I don't know why you're using them as an example. Chargebacks are there for legitimate customer issues that can't be resolved with the merchant, doublespending is a problem inherent to bitcoin and to hand-waive away the issue with "it's barely worth it to steal money this way" is incredibly naive.

For the record, I own a Nexus 4 and prefer Android to iOS. I'm seeing a lot of people here talking about a "tarnished image" and an issue that Apple has to rectify. Does everybody here know why Blockchain was removed?
They applied to have an app in the App Store. This was a view-only wallet service. Apple agreed. Blockchain modified it to allow transactions after it was in the store, and Apple removed it based on that change. I've never used the app before but you can easily find before-and-after photos. 
Obviously if you have an interest in bitcoin then you're going to be upset about it but people like to think it was for no reason. I saw a video with the CEO of Blockchain talking about how it was for no reason. I just don't see a reason to lie or be disingenuous about it.

No kidding "mass adoption" would lead to increased utility...but neither of those things necessitates a high per-BTC price either. Adoption of cryptocurrencies could increase 1000x among the world population and they could either a) use a non-deflationary coin or b) pay more and more for Bitcoins due to artificial scarcity. 
I know which one I think is likely, and you could only possibly think b) is likely if you own Bitcoins already. There's no loyalty among the general population for Bitcoin like there is here.

@_date: 2014-05-22 18:44:09


Not really. If you "own" something but don't control or have any avenues for reimbursement when lost do you really own it?


Except Gox controlled the Bitcoins and has no legal obligation to reimburse customers for losses (except a few months worth of service fees). I'd say they had possession and ownership, but I do understand what you're saying. 
If you give me the keys to your car, and agree that if I destroy your car I owe you the cost of gas I used, I pretty much own your car. It's semantics at this point, but if they have possession and no liability to reimburse that's essentially ownership to me. 


This is true, but there's no reason to relieve consumers of Gox of the conditions they agreed to. They weren't agreed to under duress or anything.

I understand what?
The banks can already print money,we know that. If they wanted to release their own crypto without inflating the US money supply, they just sell a premined USD coin to whomever needs one and "delete" a USD from the books. No change to the money supply, and they've got a crypto on the market that could do the exact same things as Bitcoin. Mining is not necessary. Vendors could accept USD coin, use it to pay their taxes or for supplies, and everybody could accept it as a USD equivalent. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 20:35:58


You're dreaming, friend. What could possibly make bitcoins worth ~8x as much as they are today? That thief that owns 6% of the world's supply also enjoys massive profits?
I think it's infinitely more likely that, in the wake of all this tremendously bad news, other alts with a much better reputation come along and scoop up the momentum. Bitcoin may be the first, and your local Chinese restaurant might accept Bitcoins only, but it's VERY easy for them to accept any other alt that gains traction. I think it's unrealistic that Bitcoin will continue to appreciate. 10% of them are owned by criminals who stole them, that's honestly reason enough to abandon ship. Bitcoins function the same at $1 as they do at $1000, so the only argument you could make for increased "value" would be scarcity, which I hope we can both agree is arbitrary and artificial and thus should not represent any value. 


Read the italics, and perhaps you should consider why you have such an unshakeable optimism for Bitcoin. Trade volume has never been lower, and people celebrate unsustainable price increases as a result of market manipulation. Conversely, I challenge you to find any concrete, logical reasons why Bitcoins should continue to appreciate in value by their own merits. 
@_date: 2014-02-09 01:02:40
So take literally any reason that bitcoin could fail, choose an altcoin that doesn't have that problem and BOOM, you have a coin with a better chance of long-term success than Bitcoin. Chargebacks alone are an absolute killer. There's 0 consumer safety in bitcoin, therefore 0 chance of mass adoption. Talking about it like it could replace Visa or an entire economy is just a joke. 
@_date: 2014-02-19 05:59:20
The "scalability" in the form of divisibility is utterly stupid when you consider what you're proposing. Bitcoins should continue to appreciate in value until a single bitcoin mined for fractions of a penny worth of electricity are worth billions of dollars? All because there's an arbitrary limit of them and artificial scarcity? I've got bad news for you - if other cryptos can do the same thing as bitcoin with no artificial scarcity, there's no real reason for bitcoins to appreciate that much. Major retailers already accept bitcoins, and they essentially work as well now as they ever will. Any price increases that bitcoin saw weren't a result of increased functionality, and the kind of growth experienced thus far certainly isn't sustainable. 
Similarly to what you said, it doesn't matter if bitcoins cost $1 or $100. You can't argue that paying more for a bitcoin makes it any more valuable as a crypto. I think it's funny that you insinuate I'm jealous just got pointing out a bunch of greedy assholes who think $100 should grow to $1 million because ~bitcoin~ even though bitcoin has no proprietary features
@_date: 2014-03-06 03:46:56


You have a valid point, if only not for the 21M arbitrary cap. You're saying $100,000,000 BTC are necessary to meet the potential when the more realistic answer is to just use a crypto with more coins available (at $1 each, even) rather than pretend Bitcoin is the only one available and continue to appreciate something 10% owned by thieves and ~40-50% owned by a few early adopters

@_date: 2014-02-13 19:12:34
There's no real way to determine the real "value". Bitcoins work the same whether you pay $1 for them or $100, or $1000, so the value isn't a result of the capabilities. Similarly, people expect the value to sharply rise despite the fact the utility doesn't change, based on scarcity. This is again illogical, because that scarcity is a result of an arbitrary limit. 
To put it concisely, bitcoin is valued based on whatever people are willing to pay for them. People invested in bitcoin will try to convince you they are undervalued and that the price will rise, but I don't think this is realistic. 
Very complex question, really.
Oh, and consider that miners are paying huge hardware and electricity costs to mine them, so it's in THEIR best interest that people keep paying high prices for bitcoins. As the price drops, more and more miners will go offline.

In both regards, as a store of value and as a means of equal wealth distribution, bitcoin is currently pretty shitty.

It's quite simple: If you want to "make" (mine) something that you claim to be worth money, you pay taxes on that creation (or receipt of mined coins). You'll pay additional taxes if your property appreciates between when you received it and when you sold it. 


I'm seeing **a lot** of people hoping to "play stupid" with the IRS. If you want to claim your coins are "worthless" when mined and sudddenly worth $500 when you sell, you'll just pay appreciation capital gains on the whole $500


This I'm not sure of. There's nowhere on personal income forms to file for capital losses, plus I simply doubt the US is willing to subsidize thousands in electricity costs for people who claims to have made a profit of a few dollars. Paying your electricity bills would just increase your profit and tax liabilities.

1. Wouldn't they be eliminating one "old" USD from the money supply for every "crypto" USD that someone buys into? The supply cap for the coin, from the point of coinception, would be the same as the supply cap of the USD. 
2. I'm not big on the mining technology and terminology, I'll admit. If they're premined, why does the government need to do any mining, or basically why wouldn't they control 100% of the network all of the time? I assume this would be done more efficiently than bitcoin mining/hashing on AMD video cards
3. If it's so revolutionary, it's inevitable that the government will regulate the process or create their own altogether. The element of trust is so essential in the banking industry, and in world economics and trade in general, that I wonder how anybody can assume it isn't.

What kind of statement is that? "As long as things are growing exponentially, volatility is A-OK!". We're talking about a reliable store-of-value here, not pie in the sky dreams of another exponential rise. 
Saying volatility has been "blown out of proportion" is ridiculous too. Since October, it's been $200 &gt; $1200 &gt; $575, volatility is a perfectly valid criticism and a major issue for a currency AND for a store of value

Nobody can tell you whether or not you bought at a "good time". Bitcoin exchanges are in the midst of being attacked and the price has been crashing over the past couple of day. It might recover, it might not. 
This is exactly why people say not to buy more Bitcoins than you're comfortable with losing entirely. Your AU $50 might be back to AU $50 in a couple days or weeks, it might never recover. You really shouldn't invest any money that you aren't okay with losing, especially as a student with not much money

I'm not so sure about this and challenge you to find a case where a dealer was arrested for embezzling funds or fraud, or even not returning customer money. They'll arrest him for selling drugs (which is illegal) but not for taking someone's money and refusing to deliver product. 
Again, I'm happy to admit that I'm wrong when I see some solid evidence to back that up, but I believe Gox would only be liable for what conditions they have set out that customers agreed to, anything else is just "too bad".

edit: eh, I guess I'll add that these kinds of investments make sense. BitPay is a genius company, they don't even have to like bitcoins to make money off them. You sell other people's BTC to yet another person and pay merchants with the fiat, earning a small profit. They can make money off any crytpocurrency, and aren't necessarily invested in Bitcoin's success in particular. Kind of amazed a CryptoPay competitor hasn't emerged.

How incredibly wrong you are. Additional security features and "theft-checking" will only increase transaction fees and confirmation times, further decreasing the use-cases for bitcoin.

How could I not? if they're involved in a transaction in any capacity, and making a cut of the transaction, they are by definition a middle man. 


You're right, but I'm skeptical about that "lowest possible price". It also has fairly low limits on transaction amounts. 


Chargebacks, if the business refuses to accept a return for valid reasons. 


Again, for very obvious reasons. You pay for something and you didn't get what you asked for and the merchant isn't cooperative in finding a resolution. 


I'm absolutely not, and I'd like to make that clear. I just don't like people disingenuously stating that bitcoin has no fees, or that it's a service with no middlemen. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 15:46:17


You are responsible for 100% of your transactions with BTC. It doesn't matter if you sent to the wrong address or sent the wrong amount, the whole idea behind bitcoin is that you are in control of your own money, solely responsible for your own mistakes. 
If I send USD via my bank to the wrong person, they take it back for me. You can just consider this an expensive lesson about how careful you need to be when acting as your own bank. You have literally 0 right to complain about any mistakes using your own money when you use Bitcoin. *That's the whole point*

Allow me to clarify something people (including the OP) seem confused about
Gox isn't coming back. Rehabilitation isn't even an option. This news article says that a class-action group has agreed to drop their suit and partner with Sunlot, however Sunlot has 0 chance of saving Gox. 
See page 5
The Japanese courts have already decided that "liquidation" is route Gox is going to take. The courts rejected Mark's (and indeed any chance of any) rehabilitation plan and decided specifically that "liquidation" is the path forward.
The trustee makes a commission on the liquidation, so it's in his best interest to find the highest bidder for the 200k Bitcoins. *However* the trustee is simply not allowed to accept rehabilitation plans. The courts have decided that creditor claims are going to be investigated and assets will be sold to cover those claims, NOT that rehab is an option and perhaps some company can turn Gox around and return more money. 
Save this post if you think I'm wrong. It'll be more than a year before the liquidation is complete but you'll be able to tell within a few weeks that Sunlot and OKCoin's plans are for nothing. The courts have decided it is time to shut down and attempt to repay creditors, not keep the business alive in hopes of repaying more (and at risk of losing all assets completely)
@_date: 2014-03-30 21:01:05
Not everybody fits into your generalizations. I don't own Bitcoins, never have, never cared to. I'm wealthy, I haven't "missed the boat" or "sold early". I don't work for the government for a bank and I don't hate cryptocurrencies. 
I also don't need to own a Bitcoin to understand how they work, or why they will fail. Conversely, simply owning Bitcoins gives you a vested interest in their success, and tends to blind people towards real issues. 
I've said for a long time now there's nothing propping the price up, and that Bitcoin is essentially a complex Ponzi scheme on the back of a normal cryptocurrency. A higher price isn't essential to the functionality of a crypto, so everybody pumping $800 BTC as "cheap" is a snake-oil salesman, and it's fun to laugh at their idiocy. 
Not everybody who disagrees with you guys is "jealous" or "trolling", you just can't acknowledge dissenting opinions maturely. Simple as that. I have dozens and dozens of downvotes on posts telling people to "stop shilling" when they suggest $700 is some kind of "sale". It's ridiculous. 
Here's an example rebuttal I got today, just to illustrate how childish some users are. 


I'm in my late 20's, independently wealthy, and have so far been right about the direction Bitcoin is taking, yet this retard shits out a bunch of generalizations to justify his limited education of economics, finances, you name it. I/we don't agree, so of course I *must* be trolling, or a teenager. 
There are some very serious problems with Bitcoin. Few people are capable of intelligently discussing them, the rest of you (including you, OP) have to justify our disagreements in your mind as some sort of jealousy. It's really pathetic.

Bear with me a minute here, okay?
That's wonderful. Couldn't twitch accept Litecoin tomorrow? and AnyOtherCoin when it gets popular? Bitcoin may have limited increased functionality, but none of that is proprietary in any way. What's good for Bitcoin is good for all bitcoins, but what's bad for Bitcoin stays with Bitcoin and doesn't count for Litecoin or Dogecoin. 
Getting back to your post, again, wonderful. A new use for bitcoin doesn't mean new functionality or enhanced safety, it's essentially just another merchant. Overstock and Tigetdirect couldn't skyrocket the price, I don't think any minor-to-medium merchants are going to either. 


Stagnation? Downward trends? The uptick today was manipulated, not natural. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 04:57:36
It's easy. You bought something with a merchant, that merchant provides your information. 
here's a quick example:
You gave BitPay a bunch of BTC and they gave you a Lamborghini. The IRS heard about this, and they want their money. They subpoena BitPay for the records, find out which Bitcoins you sent to them, trace those bitcoins back via the blockchain to when you received them and they have all the information they need. If you mined 200 BTC back when they were basically $0 and then sold them for 1000 each to buy your Lamborghini, you're going to be liable for capital gains taxes on $200,000. 
If people have shipped items to their houses paid with BTC or made obvious purchases with BTC (houses, cars) and want to play stupid about owning any, the bank can just assume a cost basis of 0 and issue massive fines/back taxes. 
Realistically, you'd be asked to perform a transaction from your wallet to theirs, maybe for a satoshi, to show control. If they suspect you own said wallet which has been used to pay for items sent to you and you claim you don't own it, they'll just assume you're lying and charge you as much as possible.

There may be companies that will instantly convert any Bitcoin donations into USD for you, at which point I don't think your accounting practices need to change. They charge a small fee for this service. 
Alternatively, if you were directly accepting bitcoins, you could provide any auditor a link to your wallet so they could view your balance and any donations. I suppose they could look up the historical price of bitcoin to see what kind of gains or losses, if any, were made between the time you accepted them and the time you "cashed out" to USD.

The only thing that's absolutely certain is that all of the remaining assets will be liquidated, so those 200k BTC aren't going to be evenly distributed, they're going to be sold in bulk and the proceeds of that sale will be used to cover court costs, lawyer fees, and lastly creditors

If Gox had operated under the same regulations you wish Lawsky had imposed upon a US exchange, they wouldn't have been able to lose so much money. Because Bitcoin was created to operate **outside of the financial industry** Lawsky was unable to protect consumers. 
It's not the US regulators fault, **in any way** that US consumers lost money on Bitcoin, conversely if Bitcoin wasn't Bitcoin and was just modern banking, US regulators and regulations likely COULD HAVE SAVED ALL OF THE MONEY
Pretty please stop calling your idiotic alternative histories "facts", we'll never know what could have been because *Bitcoin didn't want those regulations*

No, it's over. Look at the price increase from, say, March of last year to November. You're never going to see anything like that again. I've already made a thread requesting as much, but I doubt you can come up with a single factor that would reasonably lead to another 10x increase
@_date: 2014-05-12 23:04:40


This isn't accurate. There's more bitcoins in circulation now than there was four months ago and yet the price is down ~50%. 3600 new BTC being made each day doesn't increase the price unless there's demand for more than 3600 new coins each day (hint: there isn't) There's no correlation between supply and price, bitcoins are just priced according to whatever you can get people to pay for them.
@_date: 2014-05-01 04:06:13


Err, no. You can't do shit with somebody's credit card numbers, you still have to get a transaction authorized somewhere and if you manage to do that any fraudulent use is covered and reimbursed by the card. Can a Bitcoin private key get your money back? Can they decline your money being used in the first place?

1. Bitcoin is only worth what people are willing to pay, and people will try to convince others to keep paying more and more as "bitcoins" run out. Unfortunately for bitcoin, there are other cryptocurrencies that accomplish the same thing and aren't primarily owned by early adopters of thieves. 
2. It wasn't a get-rich-quick scheme, but bitcoin was originally just a concept and was never meant to be commandeered by libertarians and forced upon the world. People are trying to shoehorn trust-based banking into an inherently trust-based system.
3. No fucking way. Only an idiot would encourage somebody to "invest" right now. If you want to buy and use bitcoins, by all means go ahead, but the speculative game is over and they won't appreciate in value based on pure mania again. The cons have all come to light and for the everyday consumer they far outweigh any pros

Not quite, but I love that you used this (and every time that spambot posts it)
This is the quote:


It looks stupid, I admit, but it's out of context.
  &gt;  You mean $13 to $1200?
I posted that sentence in response to this:
 &gt;   Last year the price went from $13 to over $700 for a 56x increase. Not 1000....
I had said, simply, 1000x increases in a "couple months" aren't sustainable. bitcoin went from $1 to $1000 in several months. I shouldn't have said "couple" that's my true crime here. You can say "tulpfutures accidentally said couple when he meant several one time" but that doesn't have as much punch.
I was correcting the guy, the price topped out over $1000, not $700. That's exactly why I said


in response to


this is, again, simply me correcting this guy.
Now, ready for this? A whole new sentence! Get ready for context!
 &gt;   It's very close to 1000x, stop being pedantic.
I was talking about the increase from $1 to $1000 in a ~~couple~~several months. I wasn't multiplying $13 and 1000.
as for the watt=joule thing, I can freely admit I know fuck all about electricity and watts and joules. I copied that thread's contents verbatim from a friend of mine to get responses. Sounds like a cop out, sure, but that's the truth.

1. Money went digital a long time ago. My online bank account is proof of that. 
2. Put them in a savings account. Keeping your savings in bitcoin is actually a great way to make it lose value. 
3. It's cheap to transfer funds using banks, too. And with banks you can get your money back if you were scammed or made a typo in the send address
4. It's more fun to throw cash at strippers, or just tap my credit card on a terminal at the corner store or gas station. QR codes are kind of a pain in the ass.
5. Look at this cool $20 bill I'm holding! Are you even thinking about what you're typing?

Microtransactions are indeed one of the more reasonable use-cases for bitcoin technology, but assuming microtransactions really took off, wouldn't all of those transactions clog the network? 
In my experience, businesses would rather spend the time convincing a customer to buy a monthly subscription for $4 than trying to play nickel-and-dime.

That's wonderful. It doesn't mean the price needs to ever be $10,000 per coin. Maybe somehow miraculously Bitcoin will turn its image around and convince people to buy in at ever-increasing amounts...do you realize this increases the relative wealth of the scammers who own 10% of BTC?

In the case you're talking about they asked ghash.io nicely to lower their rate, and essentially bitcoin is lucky that ghash.io DOES have an interest in bitcoin retaining value. 
Once one person or pool controls the blockchain, as far as I know they can deem which transactions are valid and which aren't, or otherwise fork the chain if they don't like something. Now you're asking bitcoiners to trust that the 51% power will "do the right thing" and not simply manipulate the market grossly in their favor.

You're right, I don't. Consult an Introductory to Economics textbook. I don't have evidence because it's such a terrible system that it isn't used anywhere in the world. Isn't that proof enough?

" no one wants to store their money in a system that they can't see the way it works and can't be audited, hence the demand for bitcoin in the first place"
Millions of people hand their cash to the bank and don't know exactly how they store it or how they transfer the data when I pay a bill from my bank account. The demand for bitcoin is miniscule. It's a relative novelty to the modern banking industry. 
"bitcoin does for free" - this is patently untrue. there are fees involved in bitcoin, whether it's buying bitcoin at an exchange or the fee a retailer pays to bitpay, at the very least the miner fees if you ever want your transaction validated. 
The CEO of O.co announced he was holding millions in bitcoin, didn't he?
The number of people looking to change from easy-as-hell paying my utility bills from my online bank account to using Bitstock is tiny. That market was covered decades ago with the "innovation" of online banking. 
Western Union may charge 7%, but Google is allowing Gmail money transfers for free. What if they implement this worldwide for a .5% fee? Where does Bitcoin stand then? 
@_date: 2014-02-17 00:35:06
I understand all that, but the relative number of people that have "accepted it for value" is actually quite low. I suspect others will eventually learn that most of the perceived "value" in the coin is arbitrary and artificial, based on an imposed "scarcity" that's supposed to mirror gold but attempts to do so with an inherently creatable object. 
To simplify a great deal, bitcoin works just as well whether you paid $1 for it or $1,000,000 for it, there's no reason that Bitcoin should be accepted by the general public of having this artificial value. 
I didn't even downvote you though, I appreciate a polite argument 
@_date: 2014-03-25 00:13:21


In an attempt to keep this a little more civil, I politely disagree. Better contenders may already have "entered the fray" .Litecoin, Dogecoin both of these have significantly less of a negative reputation and could (potentially, however unlikely to you) accomplish the exact same features as bitcoin. If more than 99% of America hadn't bought BTC yet, there's still an enormously significant number of potential users out there who have no inclination towards or loyalty for Bitcoin. It's outlandish to say that this 0.0001% of the population has a network that won't likely ever be surpassed. If Western Union made their own coin the network of people supporting that could conceivably be bigger (not necessarily hashrate, but adoption) than BTC overnight.

Even if reversibility isn't likely for microtransactions or insurance may not be needed for a spare change wallet, there's no reason not to use a coin that had those inherent feautes anyway. They may not be applicable for a small percentage of transactions, but if the majority of them do it's better to cover everything with one coin, no? You're not "forcing people to bundle", you're offering a currency with features they may or may not need. I don't need purchase protection when I buy a chocolate bar using my debit card but it's nice to have anyway
Yes, they are gatekeepers who make enormous profits. If any of that revenue is threatened away from them, they would just as likely lose some of those profits rather than risk customers using a different payment method system, though I can't imagine anybody choosing to use a non-insured crypto if the option is available.

Google Wallet requires no trust, too? You get the email of the recipient, send your money, and voila. 


Again, where is "full control" lacking? The US Government can and has seized bitcoins, there's no "full control" here.

No shit. And one USB miner could protect the whole network if that was the only miner. Mining investment means absolutely nothing, the millions of dollars people have wasted on CPU mining, GPU mining, or soon-to-be-outdated ASICS is a sunk cost and totally irrelevant to Bitcoin's success. If the US government made a cryptocoin it would instantly be adopted faster than bitcoins and they have enough computing power to secure the network. Your arguments are totally invalid and irrelevant. 


If I could sell sea shells back to other idiots, take a cut, and pay that vendor in USD they have a reason to. Hint: This is exactly why they accept BTC


And the "legacy banking system" network effect is insurmountable for bitcoin. 


Search "UK merchant". Click the survey. 50% of merchants that accept bitcoins either already accept altcoins too or plan to in the future. 99.99% of US/EU merchants don't accept bitcoins and have no loyalty towards any specific "coin". Among r/bitcoin users this absolutely is a cult. Among the general public, there's no loyalty.

If you're so certain of your delusions, make a bet with me. $50 USD for each of these three conditions:
1. Amazon accepts bitcoin
2. (Paypal) integrates bitcoin into paypal
3. overstock sees a 10X increase in bitcoin business
If you aren't willing to bet on any/all of these things happening within 1 year then I think you ought to concede defeat on your idiotic "claims". 
Oh, as a bit of a parting shot


Ask the Amazon CEO if he gives a single fuck about what Patrick Byrne thinks. Amazon is doing great, overstock is a sinking ship looking for a novelty or gimmick to save them. Bitcoin hasn't turned things around, it isn't some amazing success story that's going to convince other retailers to switch.

No, it doesn't. This is no different than a CC that lets you spend Farmville points or ISK, it doesn't offer any "benefits" of the bitcoin network. This literally solves nothing, it's just a company accepting fees for being the middle-man in a network that's supposed to have none. It works exactly like a regular CC except you have to pay fees to pay off your balance/reload the card. It's a traditional debit card that costs the user more money than a traditional debit card...where exactly is the advantage there? 


I don't think this is ever going to happen. No company wants to accept the volatility risk, and so long as options like BitPay and Xapo exist they never will. Supporting these kinds of companies is antithetical to Bitcoin.

Yes, they own the rights to the word "Bitcoin". It really depends on who owns up with the intellectual assets of the company. Theoretically, the owner of the property (the trademark) could start suing people for infringing upon it, but more likely would just request money for liscencing or something. 
The strange part about this is that if you don't legally protect your intellectual properties you risk losing them, so the new owner would be somewhat obligated to make sure people aren't using the trademark, or otherwise consider the trademark valueless (which I don't believe it is) and disregard any infringements.

I'll admit it, you got a laugh out of me here. Yes, perhaps people should be angrier, but they aren't. Why? because there's an enormous amount of trust in the system, and also their personal bank account balances weren't affected by any "bailout fee". 


What financial products? Bitcoin isn't feasible for loans, mortgage, anything like that. It's a trustless network and you're talking about trust-based financial products. 
Yes, a 3% fee is quite high. Did you know the average CC fee is 1.5%? Are you being intentionally disingenuous? Data certainly doesn't get stolen "pretty often", and even when it does losses are insured. Alternatively, using bitcoin, the merchant pays AT LEAST a 1% fee, plus the buyer now has to pay a trans fee, plus both buyer and merchant risk losing all profits altogether from the volatility alone
The very minor "pros" of bitcoins don't outweigh the gigantic "cons" compared to simply using credit cards like people have been doing for decades. 
@_date: 2014-02-11 01:42:15
There frankly isn't one. To put it very concisely, bitcoins function the same whether they are $1 or $1000, so the value is completely arbitrary and based on another arbitrary 21M total bitcoins. 
What you're left with is people who have invested money in bitcoins who are now trying to convince others that this is the best thing since slices bread and bitcoins are totally worth $1000 each. 95% of the people who own bitcoin are doing it to get rich, not because they care about free worldwide transfers for people from africa to alaska. 
Your "clear and concise rebuttal" would probably look like:
Bitcoins are not a ponzi scheme, they are a revolutionary system of money transfer that will change the way the world banks.

Person A sells Bitcoins for cash
Person C buys bitcoins and sells them to yet another person, Person D
Person C gives person B **cash**
Person B gives Person A their car
You can't just ignore the intermediary steps because you don't feel it's particularly important. Without the intermediary Tesla wouldn't have sold a single car for BTC so it's obviously enormously relevant. 


No, they effectively exchanged bitcoins for cash, which was then used to buy the car. At no point during the transaction does the seller accept BTC for a product, BTC is *only* traded for cash. It's relevant to Person A because without Person C there wouldn't be a transaction. 


I'd be inclined to agree with you except that you are having tremendous trouble grasping this simple concept that bitcoins sold for cash doesn't equal bitcoins traded directly for goods. If I trade my way up from a paperclip to a house I wouldn't say someone accepted a paperclip for their house, the transaction simply doesn't exist without intermediaries so you're being intentionally naive/ignorant when you claim otherwise

Haha, no. Merchants will report people paying in Bitcoin and employers will report people paid in BTC. If you dumped $10-50,000 cash in your bank account from bitcoins, expect to get audited for those gains
If you've never bought something with BTC shipped to your house, cashed out at an exchange or used an ATM, you are on the radar. If you mine and hoard forever, they'll probably never be able to track you down, but everybody hoarding won't grow the economy

Just because you type something doesn't make it true. Contracts to not be held liable or agree to internal arbitration are completely commonplace and legal pal. 


They weren't hundreds of millions of dollars worth of assets, though. Some of those Bitcoins were only "worth" a couple of cents, or a fraction of a sense. I don't believe anybody who deposited a $1 bitcoin is a creditor for anything more than $1, and I'm pretty sure the bankruptcy judge will see it the same way.

Wonderful, but that's not what we're talking about. 
Total transaction cost = 
Miner fees (x%) 
+ Exchange fees (y%)
+ Volatility cost (z%)
The total of this is 100%, the cost of the transaction. 
I'm not asking what percentage the volatility cost is, I'm asking for the percentage of the whole deal. It's not a simple matter of ($x per BTC * number of BTC), that's only part of the question you dumb, smug fuck. Yes, it's $5 per BTC, $10 per 2 BTC, $15 per 3 BTC, but that $5, 10 or $15 will be a different percentage of the entire equation. I can't believe you made two posts trying to be smug to me about math when you don't even understand the equation. 
x + y = z. You sound so fucking smart saying you know the answer to Z only knowing what X is. How about you comprehend what you read before you shit out such stupid responses? 
Another example, you probably need it:
I lose $5 on 1 BTC, I pay 10 cents in miner fees and $1 on exchange fees. That's $6.10 and a volatility cost of ~$81% of the total. If I sent 3 BTC for the same transaction, I paid $15 in BTC, 10 cents in miner fees and $1 in exchange fees. Volatility cost of the transaction becomes ~93%. It's the same percentage loss per BTC you've been shouting about, but that's **not what I'm talking about at all**
Do you understand this simple concept? Do you "get it", idiot?

No, because it doesn't matter how you denominate the bitcoins when thieves own a solid 10%
Bear with me for a moment and consider this point alone. Thieves own 10% of the economy. If all the remaining coins were mined tomorrow, they'd own roughly 5%. The expectation is that because of limited supply we're supposed to keep paying more and more for these bitcoins to the benefit of anybody who's hoarding. That's not a logical monetary system, it's extremely irrational. It's much more likely (and moral, in fact) to not support this "limited-supply" system by overvaluing each coin but rather to continue to use fiat or use an alt, as OP suggests, for your commerce. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 15:36:06
Nope. I think you're overestimating.

Frankly I don't think Dogecoiners or Litecoiners are as funny. 


I doubt I've ever said this either. bitcoin has very obviously already "succeeded" in a sense. You can use it to buy things or send money to Africa for essentially free. I simply have an issue with the ponzi-esque expectation of an ever-increasing bitcoin price when cryptocurrencies all function the same, it's illogical to an outsider.

I'm not going to say anymore than I'm sure MySpace thought Facebook would never "completely catch up". You're being ignorant of very real potential competition. Nothing about bitcoin guarantees its success. 
Literally everything about your last paragraph was more hand-waiving and defense of bitcoins *arbitrary* supply-derived price, so I think I'll just call it quits here. 
edit: Dude, you're addicted to RC Cola, the only popular cola on the market today. Vending machines only serve RC, and RC is the only thing accepted at the stores you like (for some reason you are trading cola for products instead of using money). 
Coke and Pepsi are around the corner whether you want to acknowledge that or not. You'll never believe that they could taste better, or give you the same 591ml for 1/100 the price and STILL work the exact same way. If it costs $700 in BTC to buy a $700 USD product, there's no reason you shouldn't get 10 BTC for your $700, or even 1000 BTC. The number is *arbitrary*, and arbitrary in your favor as an owner. Continue being ignorant, I'm certain Myspace will rule the market forever and RC Cola could continue to charge $700/bottle for their LIMITED EDITION formula

Were they really bought and sold for $1200, or were they bought with Goxbux and given out as (now worth less) GoxBTC? It's interesting to consider the other factors. I appreciate the reply, but obviously not the unnecessary insult. 
Just to add a bit, it was common to see people scold others for using Gox's price as "real figures", and frequent jokes were made about how difficult it is to cash out of. Make no mistake, whether people paid it or not. Gox's prices were *artificially high* in order to boost or prop up the market's perceived value

Nearly 10% for sending $50 is pretty terrible, but ~1-2% for sending up to $900 isn't bad at all. That's better than Western Union, and you don't have to (pay a fee to) buy bitcoins, transfer or sell them. 
Like it or not, this is pretty serious competition. It requires absolutely 0 effort and is accessible to everybody, whether they have a cell phone or the internet or not. Between this and Google Wallets totally free transfers, a big chunk of Bitcoin's lunch just got eaten 
edit: This is pretty indicative of larger players realizing there's a demand for money transfers and that there's money to be made doing so. Amazon, Google, Apple, Facebook and Walmart will never accept Bitcoins, you can see how easy it is for any of those giants to make their own service. There's no reason for any of them to buy into bitcoin's infrastructure when they can simply make their own.

No. People will downvote me and argue this and link me to the wiki "Scalability" page without comment, but the bitcoin network can't handle even a small fraction of the world's commerce. If even just microtransactions became popular, enough of them and the network is totally clogged with these tiny transactions.

Hell, if that "Enjoy Sochi" spam increased 3x the network would already be at it's capacity, and those tx's don't even cost the attacker a penny.

Between buying, transferring, and selling $50 worth of BTC you could easily pay $4.50 in fees/above market rates. ~1% to send up to $900 isn't bad at all, and considering how fewer steps it involves vs sending BTC it's a clear winner.

Right, and its news that drives the price. There's no real demand, its hysteria. If there was any appreciable real demand for the product then the price wouldn't sink 50% in a few months. You neglected to answer the question in my last post, as well. Customers didn't demand Bitcoins until they were worth $1000 based on supply, they were told Bitcoins were $800 today and going to be $1000 tomorrow and hysteria kicked in. Not to be snarky or anything but I don't see how you went to business school and can attribute the price in any way to some short-lived demand. By the way, I have at least the same credentials as you, I've had my MBA for a while now.

I think false. One day the block reward is x and Average Joe doesn't care and isn't willing to pay $y for Bitcoins, the next day when the block reward is half of X Average Joe isn't going to suddenly be willing to pay double for a commodity he didn't originally value anyway. 
If we're struggling to find bids above $400 I don't know why people think the price is entitled to double, there simply isn't a demand for Bitcoins in that price ranger regardless of the supply 
edit - the price of bitcoins will never change to suit the mining industry, it is the mining industry that will always be adapting to the price.

I partially agree with you, there should be some compensation for investment or innovation, but people here literally love the idea that people who mined for a couple hours in 2009 deserve to be billionaires for their great innovation and risk and contribution to society. That's ridiculous. Bitcoin is essentially a less regulated and more technological Western Union, it isn't nearly an important an innovation as the Internet and basically far greater men have contributed much more to society and asked much less in return. 
Bitcoins are here, they work. They don't need to cost $600 each, they don't need to cost $10,000,000 each. If people are going to be deserving of big returns based on investments it should be companies like Bitpay and not just miners who have arguably contributed nothing at all besides some time and electricity. 
Again, the idea that people who mined bitcoins deserve to be billionaires for that alone if ridiculous, and I can't believe I hear that from the same people who complain about wealth disparity

This is an awfully stupid sentiment. China was the reason we had an ATH in the first place. The price dropped several hundred dollars amid the first bad news from China, more recently dropped another $50 after the PBOC made an announcement they were going to be taking action, and the price is down another $20 today after *one of the smallest* Chinese exchanges announced closure. 
Are you really deluded enough to believe that the closure of larger Chinese exchanges won't have an effect? You think Bitcoin can lose another 7-10% of its prospective customer base and the main reason the price rose in the first place and still flourish? I feel kind of sorry for you, that kind of naivete must be painful

A drop in one year doesn't indicate volatility, rather small-but-sustainable yearly increases indicate stability. Gold's not going to jump up 40% and then back down another 50% within one week like bitcoin does. Yes, Gold is in fact stable. Stability isn't a guarantee against drops. 
Conversely, Bitcoin grows 1000% in a year and people think that's somehow sustainable or realistic growth

"It's a screenshot from the App Store as it was presented. The logic being that the screenshots blockchain.info provided would have been intended to fool the reviewers.

This is actually the second time the app has been banned from the store for the same reason."

There's a good reason you don't run a company, and I think it's incredibly likely you haven't taken a solitary business class in your life. Let's examine the "benefits" of mastercard randomly adopting bitcoin


Chargebacks are what protect consumers against fraud. Insurance is what protects consumers against fraud. Did Bitcoin stop Danny Brewster of Neo&amp;Bee from committing fraud? What about Mark and Gox? Bitcoin doesn't do anything to prevent fraud, because there is no customer service backend. Fraud happens and you live with it, that's Bitcoin. Don't be naive. 


I have a Mastercard. I can literally tap it on to a terminal to pay for gas or groceries and walk away. It literally cannot get simpler than 1-tap NFC payments. Conversely with Bitcoin I have to wait 10 minutes for a confirmation. Bitcoin doesn't simplify anything for the consumers, there's no incentive for people to switch to something more cumbersome. 


You know bitcoin transactions cost more than $25 each to process when you include miner's rewards, right? Bitcoin is much less efficient than MC's current system, what you want is for them to lower customer fees. 


You think Mastercard is paying ~$25 per transaction in internal processing costs? Please join us in reality Sarah_R
Before MC ever entertained accepting Bitcoin they would create and mine their own coin. At the absolute very least there's no reason for them to pay the 6c transaction fee when their own network could process 0 fee transactions internally. 


There isn't, but you're naive and delusional and mindlessly optimistic so forgive me for raining on your parade with some reality.

ATMs are nodes in the network? Coinkite's terminals are nodes in the network? 
Dogecoin users already keep their dogecoins in their own wallets, same for Litecoin users. I don't know why you're assuming that just because a tiny amount of money and people supporting bitcoin can't be totally surpassed by the government, a coin which they could literally force acceptance upon to the merchants. 
I seriously don't understand what you're even trying to get at. You don't think the bitcoin network could never be imitated, or replaced? That the entirety of the US government couldn't possibly produce the necessary mining power, or hire the same amount of programmers to produce the infrastructure?
Or are you trying to say that Bitcoin wallets are the only wallets that could ever be used with ATMs or by merchants? That some relatively minor amount of labor will prevent any other coin from ever replacing bitcoin in the market?
Like, I don't understand how a person could be so naive, or just willfully ignorant of the potential of competition and so ignorantly confident in the unlimited surety of bitcoins success

I really don't think it's this way. There's a (imo) good chance that bitcoin, as a result of its failings, will fall to the sidelines as just another crypto in use. The pie-in-the-sky $100,000 "grandchildren's future" valuation necessitates serious worldwide adoption and a continual decision to overvalue Bitcoins relative to their equally-functional altcoin counterparts. I simply don't think that's realistic. 


I agree. And the intermediary for that conversion from USD to merchant's goods is cryptocoins. Whether BTC or Doge is the intermediary here, facilitating the trade between a consumer and a merchant, the function of the cryptocurrency remains the same, the value of the units used utterly irrelevant to the trade. Again, it doesn't matter if it's 1 Unit used while trading or 10 Units used, thus it doesn't matter if trading $100 means buying 1 bitcoin or buying 10 bitcoins or buying .1 bitcoins. How can it be reasonably expected that people pay ever-increasing amounts for this money transfer units when other money-transfer-units (altcoins) can do the same job without the premium? 
@_date: 2014-03-23 01:48:59


Hold a dollar bill in your hand. You have more control of that money than you do your bitcoin wealth. If you bought bitcoins early this year, you've lost roughly 20% of your money, no control over that loss. The price is down roughly 10% this week.

If bitcoin sales took a big enough bite out of Visa's pocket they might, but Overstock said bitcoin sales are only 1-2% of their business so I don't think they'd make much of a dent, especially with some of the poor customer service people have received during bitcoin transactions

That's a fine example, and really where bitcoin has any use at all. I'm guessing you can see now why people won't ever use bitcoin for business transactions, security is essential. 
Also, as an aside, there's no money transmitter in the world that would charge 2.5% on a $100M transaction. The fees get much smaller when you're sending such large amounts, no bank in the world is going to charge a fee anywhere near $1M.

Any bitcoins you mine are taxed immediately, and then again if you spend them somewhere. You pay capital gains tax on the "free money" you just mined, and then capital gains/losses when you spend depending on if the value of BTC changed between when you mined it and when you spent it.

You must not have Googled very hard to find the first two answers, and the third question is impossible to answer objectively (and by that I mean every answer you get will be an opinion)
1. No. 
2. Yes they are "real" in the sense they are a cryptocurrency you can buy and sell like bitcoins, but there are no physical dogecoins either. They are different from bitcoin is many other ways too, just like all of the other alternative cryptocurrencies (Litecoin, etc)
3. My opinion is no, but if you think Bitcoin could rise back up to its all-time high now would be a decent time to buy in. Don't ever buy more than you're comfortable completely losing, it's that risky. Your money could double or be completely gone in two weeks

"Did they just not notice the blockchain app until now? Did they update their policy so it could be specially banned?"
Just so you know, it was banned because it was submitted to Apple as a view-only app, and then changed to allow transactions. Literally all that Blockchain needs to do to regain their spot in the App Store is go back to what they submitted to Apple. 
Downvote if you must, but that's the truth, plain and simple. Buy an android if you want to send and receive bitcoins on your phone, Blockchain's updated app was against the TOS they agreed to before they modified their app.

I'm sorry to break it to you, but the "scarcity" of Bitcoins is totally artificial and specific to Bitcoin in particular. Other altcoins aren't scarce, and thus there's no value behind an artificial scarcity. 
Gold is real-world scarce, not artificially so. Bitcoin ironically aims to imitate this scarcity, despite being nothing but data on a computer that is in no way inherently limited. 


So, what else is the electricity used for? Please don't say "waste heat"

@_date: 2014-02-20 23:02:58
You're ignoring my question, whether intentionally or not I'm not sure. I didn't specify where I bought the bitcoins, because it doesn't matter. My point (again, please pay attention this time) is that a bitcoin you mined in 2009 or paid $5 a year or so ago functions the exact same as ones you can buy at BTC-E today. There's no rational reason for the price increase, no increase in utility or value. A bitcoin is a bitcoin. A $1 bitcoin works the same as a $100 bitcoin and any difference in price between is totally speculative and artificial. 
If people realize this en masse, that a bunch of jokers are trying to convince people to pay $1000 for something that works the same if they pay $10, that's huge. It's fine as a pseudo-anonymous monetary system, but it didn't need all this speculative value as now it just looks like a ponzi to outsiders. 
Realistically, if someone asked me today why bitcoins are $100 at one exchange and $500 at another, I couldn't say it's because one of them is 5x more useful. It's because people at the $500 shop expect people to pay that much, and when they stop the price will keep lowering, and lowering, and lowering. 
The speculative value of bitcoin is gone, and speculative holders were the ones propping this whole thing up.

laws for what, exactly? Anybody buying bitcoins may as well have bought WoW Gold. What guarantee is there of any retention of value? Your example is non-comparable and very convoluted. 
If you sold someone books, physical property, and they didn't provide payment, you're due the value of that property. Bitcoin has no physical property. No verifiable and agreeable current value (after all, someone JUST sold for $102 and some people mined Bitcoins essentially for free) and more importantly no laws regarding its use and care. 
If you randomly sent somebody books, what obligation do they have to protect them for you, or even not to resell them? Was there some sort of Terms and Conditions? Otherwise, you just sent your property across the Ocean with no guarantee you'll ever see it again. Keep this in mind. 
If it was your friend, and he WAS supposed to take care of your stuff (and you had proof of this) and he sold them, you MIGHT be able to win in court. Bitcoin is a whole different beast. Go ahead, read the T.O.S you agreed to when using Gox. I'm actually not sure what they were, but I can promise you they have no obligation to return your bitcoins to you in the event they are "lost". 
There's simply no law someone can point to and claim that it applies to bitcoins and therefore victim 1 should be repaid 100%, or 50%, or anything. It's unregulated, and they mentioned specifically in the NYS DoF meetings that bitcoin losses would not be covered by traditional investment insurance funds

Clearly you do not understand the total lack of value to an arbitrary supply. There's demand for millions of bitcoins? Great! Well I'm going to use a million cheap Whatevercoins rather than pay $1000/BTC simply because there's a limit of 21 Million and 10% have already been stolen.
Seriously, what part of that don't you understand? You're acting like Bitcoins appreciation in value is inevitable fact, but it's based on an artificial, arbitrary supply that you are *counting* on people paying a premium for. 


There's literally no way you can argue that the 21M bitcoins wasn't an arbitrary number. It was, that's a fact, and now all bitcoin owners are hoping that "just works" for commerce and once the supply runs low the value skyrockets rather than switching to something of more available supply. 
I dunno, man. Read this over and over until you "get it" because it's honestly incredible that you can claim anybody not "understand" something about honoring the incredible value of your super-duper limited Bitcoins when alternatives already exist.

Here's the thing: It *is* exciting technology, however that goes for ALL of cryptocurrencies. bitcoin is the only one standing on its own homemade pedestal shouting down the others about how they have no chance whilst also making grandiose claim about a hysterical demand (that doesn't exist) skyrocketing the price rather than the much more likely scenario of people adopting *other, more reasonable* coins.

If it's a prepaid card, is it bitcoins or fiat? If it's bitcoins I presume it still has the same 10-min confirmation time issues, or you risk doublespending. Alternatively, if it's fiat, then they aren't accepting bitcoins at all. You can convert your BTC to fiat and then buy a preloaded Tim's Card...that's a more realistic "solution" than TH directly accepting BTC or accepting via CK and hurting their service times 
TH already has their own "debit card" system, I'm not sure how Bitcoin could possibly improve upon that. If you could buy these cards with Bitcoin you would avoid the issues Bitcoin brings to the table...but then you also aren't using Bitcoin at all, you're using Fiat.

Exchanges are *already* doing this, essentially. Haven't we seen dozens of stories of people not able to cash out during crashes, or having buy orders delayed when things are climbing? Didn't an exchange recently apologize for catching traders in a short, something that would kill them overnight in the real stock market?
Furthermore, merchants aren't going to want to take the risk of floating your money for a miniscule increased profit while they run the risk of actually losing any profit at all due to the volatility.

You're making the very incorrect assumption that Bitcoins are as useful as The Internet or Email. I'll politely ask that you not be "such a blockhead" TODAY as to conflate the usefulness of these two things. 
I remember people naysaying The Internet too. There was never a time where 62+% of the population thought The Internet was "a scam" like people think of BTC. I'm sorry, but the comparison just isn't valid. If Bitcoin were nearly as ubiquitously useful as The Internet or Telephones, adoption wouldn't be less than 0.001% after five years. 


I'm still not sure why you make these ridiculous assumptions about me. Tell me again how old I am, or what kind of electronics I own or don't own. I adore that you have to portray me as some tech-hating 80 year old because I couldn't possibly be a tech-savvy 25 year old who just doesn't think of bitcoins as highly as you and the rest of your 0.001% do.

Are you serious? The whole idea of bitcoin is that you aren't supposed to be able to do fractional reserve banking or print more money. 
Let's say a house costs $100,000 and each BTC is worth $500 today. OP takes a 200 BTC loan and is supposed to pay back 225 BTC in 20 years for the house. 
in 25 years, each BTC because of deflation is now worth $1500 USD. By the time the loan was due, the customer would owe the equivalent of $300,000 for the loan. That's why loans in a deflationary economy just don't work. There's no incentive to risk and lend money when you can just hoard and get "guaranteed" returns *without* stimulating the economy

Lawyers don't matter when they're no law for them to argue. Again, DEREGULATED, no rules. Wild west.

I guess you could say gold had no *intrinsic* value until it was used as a conductor, but I'm not even sure if that's true so I guess you could look it up. In any event, Gold has a value **both** intrinsically and as an exchange of value, so please stifle your "laughter", pal.

Traditionally, yes, businesses acting as financial exchanges are subject to strict regulations including consumer protection regulations. 
I don't believe Mt.Gox or any BTC exchange have the same responsibilities when holding on to consumer Fiat. You paid Fiat, they gave you Bitcoins, there's no guarantee the value of that bitcoin will remain anything above $0 and no obligation for Mt.Gox to refund or reimburse you in the event that BTC on their exchange devalue to $0. They also have no obligation to allow you to move your BTC from their exchange to another.

I see Bitcoin surviving, and cryptos being used in the future for their niche, but it won't replace or takeover the existing financial infrastructure in any way.

I'll agree with this, however that's a two way street. As "underappreciated" Bitcoin is as a payment protocol, *bitcoin* is over-appreciated as the world's one true and only valuable cryptocurrency. I agree that the technology is somewhat useful, but that same usefulness lives on whether bitcoins are being used or Dogecoins or whatevercoins, and the same functionality exists whether BTC are $10 each or $10,000 each. 


I don't think that's likely, but kudos to you. If using bitcoin saves you on CC fees, well that's the whole point. I have no issues whatsoever with that. It's when people evangelize about how your units of transfer are infinitely valuable that it gets annoying

Having to pay somebody once a month for something you agreed to doesn't feel like being "held captive" to anybody in normal society, I assure you. That's a very fringe group. 
How is the blockchain public? How do I determine who owns which bitcoins? If I give you a bank account number, you can find the owner. if I give you a bitcoin address, what information can you gleam from that? 
Are you saying being able to cheat your taxes is just a perk of this new technology? Some charities have high overheads, that sucks. Sending money them via bitcoin doesn't obligate them to spend that money any differently than if you sent it to them in USD. Maybe I missed your point there. 
I don't see the value in "proving a transaction happened". That's what paper receipts are for, and that's what for customer information databases owned by banks and credit card companies are for. 
I laugh every time people talk about attaching a title or a deed to the blockchain. That's already handled in a very legal, binding and professional manner with lawyers. That's a non-problem that doesn't need Bitcoin to solve.

Do you "get" it yet? I don't see what you're having so much trouble with here. As cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin *functions* the same as most others. If I wanted to accept LTC for my house, I could. 
That *is* just popularity

Ask Myspace how totally impervious the network effect is. 
I'll concede that you have a point with the market cap being necessarily high for worldwide economic use, but that just brings me back to 2 of my other problems with bitcoin, scalability and an arbitrary, artificial supply (limited further by thieves, holders, and the creator who inexplicably escapes the normal "premine!" hate)
Bitcoin literally couldn't handle the world's business if it wanted to, confirmations would take years and people would have a multi-petabyte blockchain in a matter of days. Don't even get me started on how stupid mining is and how little regard I have for the people who think running their computer entitles them to internet-futuremillions

@_date: 2014-03-15 19:51:21


What part do you think I don't understand?


Part of BTC's value is derived from an artificial scarcity. *Only* 21 M coins. Since 10% of these have been stolen (and presumably hoarded) and another 1M are owned by the creator/early adopters, the arbitrary 21M limit is negatively affected. Now, we're supposed to command a premium because of "scarcity" and "demand" but realistically demand is in the toilet and the scarcity isn't real...so why should any value be derived from this artificial limit?
Conversely, something like Dogecoin (I'm not an altcoin owner, let me be clear) can function the exact same way as BTC but without some arbitrary limit contributing to "scarcity".
Is that clear enough for you? Again, what part of this don't I understand?

No, I don't, and it's because the problems plaguing **bitcoin** aren't inherent to bitcoin.

Can you be a little more specific about what you're referring to? Again, **several** Chinese exchanges have confirmed the PBOC won't allow them to use bank accounts for bitcoin funds specifically after April 15th. What specifically are you referring to? And was the guideline you're referring to ever acknowledged by exchanges, or was it published on a reputable Chinese news site like Caixin? I'd be a lot more likely to consider something FUD if it was literally just something you heard with no sources, but the ban I'm talking about has been cited by several affected businesses and also published in a reputable site, so please back up your claims that this is similar in any way with some sources, thanks.

If the current banking system takes 3 days for a transfer and IRS coin could do it in six minutes, that's an advantage. If the receiver doesn't need a bank account but just an address, that's an advantage.

Although they are technically "Bitcoins", you don't call Dogecoins "a Bitcoin" or Litecoins "A bitcoin". There's some pretty solid ground to enforce the trademark.

You can't ban bitcoins, they don't really exist. How can you make it illegal to hold this nonoffensive financial data? It's so difficult as to be impossible, so the route they chose was to cut off the supply of money. Saying they won't ban it isn't the same thing as "we're embracing bitcoin", so again the conclusions to draw were obvious to everybody except those who choose to deny and *to this very day* are ignorant enough to use terms like "regulatory uncertainty" after several notices were posted with very clear narratives.

We're both just speculating here, but if Apple does launch some sort of payment system, I don't think it will involve mining or look anything like bitcoin. Google has already allowed sending money via Gmail (in the US) for free, I presume Apple would create something similar, and eventually one or both would expand worldwide. 
Where does Bitcoin fit into this? If Apple/Google are accomplishing the same thing, using a trusted name, people will use those systems. Bitcoin will always have appeal as an "anonymous" currency, but that doesn't equate to mainstream success and I don't think bitcoin will ever have an effect on Apple's business (sounds kind of harsh but that's the most succinct way to put it)

This is just so convoluted and stupid. Again, there's no instances in which a bank says "no sorry sir Mr.A got ripped off last week so we can't lend out money". Mr.A pays for protection, they don't start charging Mr.B higher account fees.

You don't have to convince anybody to switch. People mining BTC aren't the only miners in the world. The government could just hire people to mine. You're not thinking very hard about this dude. 
I don't know why you're making me repeat this constantly. Using Alts has nothing to do with Bitcoin. You don't have to convince 51% of the network to change ATMs, you don't need to convince 51% of the Bitcoin network to mine Govcoins, you just do it alongside Bitcoin and as a result, bitcoin fails.

You're misunderstanding. Bitcoins have a "limited supply" whereas other Cryptos don't. Most of the predictions for Bitcoin's price are based on the (faulty) assumption that no other cryptos exist nor will they ever gain ground (see Bitcoin as Myspace counting on the impervious "network effect")
The entire world can use Dogecoins for all of their crypto needs (bear with me). There's no artificial "limited supply" of Dogecoins so demand isn't a factor, nor should it be considering BTC are just 1's and 0's like every other crypto. 
Assuring people that BTC is the only viable Coin and that the price will inexplicably jump 10x *does* make it sound like a ponzi, I'm sorry if that upsets your delicate sensibilities but that's just the facts. 
To put it concisely, there is no value to the "liimited supply" of Bitcoins. It's essentially a gimmick that the rest of the world is going to largely ignore when other cryptos exist that suit their needs perfectly without having to pay a "premium" for using BTC vs Doge or whatever.

"“The first ruling states that, to the extent a user creates or “mines” a convertible virtual currency solely for a user’s own purposes, the user is not a money transmitter under the BSA."
The FinCEN ruling talks about mining, not purchasing bitcoins to resell at a profit. I'd ask a lawyer for their interpretation. 
edit: Just to speculate a little further, if you use medical marijuana as an example some patients can grow their own dope for personal use, but selling it to a friend is still illegal.

1% isn't realistic. .25% or something like that is a lot more realistic, and in line with the fact that Bitcoins sales have dropped considerably (and perhaps rose from &lt;.1% to .125%. 
In any event, Bitcoin isn't the retail success story for Overstock that everybody hoped it would be. Amazon does Overstock's entire year in Bitcoin in just a few minutes every. single. day.

Because they are "not very good" at using the bitcoin system? You shouldn't have to be "good" or even smart to use a bank. The only way I could be robbed of my savings is if I carried it on me, in cash. Equally stupid would be keeping literally any amount of money in a bitcoin account. Cold storage is a laughable term when the alternative is just to keep using the same system we've been using for hundreds of years
Paper receipts for anything bought in cash, sure. There's still a record in the merchant's computer anyway. 
@_date: 2014-02-12 01:14:49
A word of caution - If you can save yourself money by converting to USD "cheaper" than BitPay or another merchant service provider, that's great. There's a good reason that Overstock and Tigerdirect convert to USD though, and it's not just the volatility. You'd be wise not to keep your public wallet holding too much bitcoins lest they get irreversibly stolen somehow. Cash out every so often and keep the money in a federally insured bank, only keep as much BTC on hand as you're comfortable losing or having completely devalue overnight
@_date: 2014-03-24 23:50:44


This barely makes sense, and with your "you're" fudge it isn't even English 10**1**. If profits rise, it could mean one of a million different things. If your profits rise because a bunch of people convinced you to learn this new system and accept these "coins", you want to keep as much of that savings as you are legally allowed to. Do me a favor and don't ever try to "educate" someone about your idea of "Economics 100". 
@_date: 2014-02-21 03:53:43
haha, I understand how it could sound like that, but I assure you I don't own any bitcoin or altcoins. I think you've got to agree that while cryptocurrencies certainly have a place in the "financial services" (?) market, bitcoin isn't guaranteed to be the only player simply because it's the first brand name or one in the news, and as a result a price-premium for scarcity is totally illogical when that scarcity isn't representative of the loss of anything significant or, more importantly, irreplaceable. 


Nobody here wants to acknowledge the possibility, but it could be that Bitcoin is RC Cola, the only sodas in the world are RC Cola, Faygo, and Shasta, and RC Cola is just hearing all this news about "Coca Cola" and "Pepsi" and totally ignoring the potential that they aren't perfect or even close to what people want to use all the time. 
Also RC Cola is charging $500 a bottle because they are "limited edition" but when Coke and Pepsi come out they will sell you as many as you want for $2, and if you don't like it you can get a refund
Sorry my analogy got a little out of hand. I'm thirsty. 
@_date: 2014-03-22 16:22:22


Cash has no intrinsic value, its still backed by the government. 


A bunch of early investors were able to sell their bitcoins for $1200. Everybody hopes new adopters will drive up the price, therefore willing to pay more for Bitcoins than even earlier adopters paid. That's why people see it as a ponzi


I won't argue this, but it's also a necessary evil to maintain the economy we have now. A deflationary economy would mean people (mostly) only buy stuff they need, as their money would be worth more the next day. As frivolous consumerism stops, so do A LOT of jobs supporting that consumerism. 
@_date: 2014-12-28 20:47:43


There's no such thing dude. 


I don't think there's much evidence that holding = stability, but I'd like to see your proof. The price of bitcoin reacts to news and the latest exchange crash, it's far too immature to be reliant on some holders for stability. I sincerely doubt you can draw any correlations but be my guest. 


And as I said that's a terrible indicator of the health of an economy. 


Whoa I thought there was too much adoption? 


There's not a single person in the world not buyng Bitcoins today because they aren't scarce enough. This is absolutely foolish. People buy and use bitcoins because of their utility not because of their scarcity. There are people buying Bitcoins in part for their scarcity but not a single one of those purchases would be made if it weren't for the potential of eventually spending that Bitcoin at a merchant. Nobody is buying bitcoins purely for their scarcity and not at least in part for their utility. 




You just typed an entire irrelevant paragraph about the purchasing power of bitcoin when I was talking clearly about divisibility. Merchants don't care what the dollar-to-bitcoin ratio is because right now they're only getting dollars anyway. 
I'm not trying to be rude but you've got some very strange ideas about what is good and healthy for an economy.

Wow that's some serious backing that Bitcoin has. The network is so supportive in its backing that you get no compensation and nobody cares if you lose money. What a valuable network and backing entity! Clearly lessons have been learned and no other exchange will lose money or be trusted with money...oh, wait, it already happened again.

This whole thing is just shit_r/bitcoiners_say.txt. You need people spending and using the money to show the potential of the functional economy.

If people build infrastructure for BTC and BTC is dead on arrival, they'll happily switch to an alt.

I agree with you, but an arbitrary number simply doesn't work my friend.

The price is going down because bitcoins aren't worth $1000. They aren't worth $600. It's frankly a miracle that so many greedy people could be convinced they were undervalued at $900. The volume isn't there, the demand isn't there. Other cryptos are going to be more and more competitive.

I've discussed this here before. Adding the lines of code for a Bitcoin ATM to sell Dogecoins is **trivial**. Coinkite terminals accepting Litecoins is **trivial**.

@_date: 2014-03-15 18:28:54


I'm really not. I just don't see the reason to pay $10,000 for a bitcoin (essentially a gigantic premium paid to early adopters) when other coins can do the same thing (but don't yet have an equivalent to BitPay)


I think people are more likely to use an alt than ever use Bitcoin so much that demand is actually a factor. If we finally hit that point, why should people start paying more for Bitcoins? Roughly 10% are owned by thieves, people can just as easily use an alt rather than pay a premium for low-supply Bitcoins (especially when Supply is limited artificially and by thieves)


No, but it certainly wouldn't hover at $1000 inexplicably whilst other alts that work the exact same (and aren't owned by thieves/plagued by reputation) can do the same thing. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 00:58:30

Not quite donnie. They sent it for approval as a read-only wallet, and then changed it to allow transactions. I'll be happy to link you to proof if you can't be bothered to find it yourself. They didn't "pick out Bitcoin", they removed an app that modified itself to violate the TOS. The Dogecoin app is view-only and that's allowed.

What in the world do you interpret as "unclear" about repeated notices saying to knock off any business related to Bitcoin? That seems pretty clear to me!


What world do you live on? Basically every Chinese exchange is on its last legs using loophole "recharge" codes that are already getting knocked down. If we assume the worst Huobi, OKCoin and several other exchanges outright close overnight, or have their business closed for violating PBOC guidelines repeatedly. 


That "trouble" is no trouble at all. More people would use Amazoncoin overnight than Bitcoin, and allowing people to mine is totally unnecessary. Amazon employees can premine.

Bitcoins aren't scarce, only "bitcoins" are, so there's no value derived from an artificial scarcity. You may "respect" that scarcity, but 99.999% of the world doesn't. It's artificial. 
And, again, other cryptos can offer the same utility. You can't say Bitcoin's price comes from either it's utility or scarcity, since neither of those things are proprietary or trademarked in any way.

There's millions of dollars of venture capital money being invested in cryptocoin infrastructure.

If that's the case they weren't lost. Lost bitcoins are lost forever, you lost or forgot the private key or deleted your wallet.dat. Compared to a bank, I could never lose my money. I can lose my bank card, but I just show up with ID and I'm set. You compared bitcoins to cash, not to an insured and secure bank. 


Oh look, more disingenuous bullshit. Who's giving cash to someone they don't trust? Are you saying people don't trust their banks? It doesn't cost "a massive fortune" to send money, though it does cost a modest fee depending on what service you're using. This is the cost of security, compliance with AML/KYC regulations, and insurance. 


Great, and then they have Bitcoins, not money. 99.999% of the world would have to cash out their bitcoins to do anything with it, which will probably take as long as a bank transfer. You don't send someone $10,000 so they can spend it at Overstock, you send money to pay for rent and emergencies. 


Why not "Bury it in the ground?" Oh, because that doesn't match your dumb narrative? 


Again, you didn't compare bitcoin in the same way. If bitcoin collapses due to bad investments/whatever (Gox, NeoBee) there is no FDIC, there's nothing at all. Nice valid comparison idiot.


They'll have bitcoins, not cash. This isn't usable for everyday commerce, you aren't making a valid comparison between a usable currency and another usable currency. I can send someone an email today instantly, if they can't pay their rent with it immediately then how useful is it?


Why did you even type this if you intended to compare it to a bank? Oh, again, to create this idiotic bitcoin circlejerk narrative you want to maintain. Normal people keep money in a bank.


Why would anyone buying a house not already have money in a bank? No shit a bank is going to ask where $250,000 cash comes from. You're just complaining about money-laundering compliance at this point


Again, backups. Where do the Gox people get their backup from? Do you know what a "loss" or "lost" actually fucking means you disingenuous shill?


Ahahahahahahahahahaha so easy the future of money just find someone else to give you cash. **Banks deal with functional currencies, not internet play money you have to convert to use**

Well it certainly is in terms of supporting the coin and showing support. Any merchant would accept anything as payment if a company is willing to take that anything from anybody, sell it back to someone for USD, take a cut and pay that merchant. It says nothing for the value of Bitcoin. 


It has brought in new customers, but not in any significant volume. BTC sales are less than 1% of Overstock sales totals. Yes, they spend more per user, but I'd be spending a lot too if I just gained $800 per BTC and suddenly had somewhere to spend it. 


You can invest in Bitcoin (cryptocurrency) succeeding without personally buying bitcoins or even thinking bitcoins will ever grow in value. A guy as smart as him must understand points both you and I understand about the rather arbitrary value of a bit coin.

It's nit-picky, but Bitpay doesn't really solve that problem, they just absorb any losses and reap any gains from the change in currency. I'm still not sure whether they immediately sell the coins on the market or are holding every coin used in hopes it rises. 
Some of the (minor) cons include:
Customers paying a transaction fee
"Long" confirmation times (credit are debit are practically instant, bitcoin can take 10-60 minutes to confirm if I understand correctly), cash if obviously as instant as can be
Infrastructure requirements - bitcoin requires an internet connection and some hardware (POS terminal, cell phone), though again these are a relatively small cost

Most people don't carry a wallet overstuffed with cash, they have two mm-thin plastic cards (debit and credit) that both **protect** their money, and perhaps a smartphone app. 
Calling Bitcoin "a better choice" is idiotic. It's only "better" if you're totally okay with being 100% wiped out in the event of any kind of problem, with absolutely no recourse. 
basically, only bitcoin owners are delusional enough to think that the Average Joe would consider using bitcoins "better" than the plastic cards we already have

Not really, but it really depends. Companies like BitPay are offering commendable services. "Captains of Industry" who mine in their basement and consider that worthy of a multi-million USD reward is laughable. The people that delude themselves into thinking 1.5 BTC will buy them a Ferrari one day are sad. 


I agree, but the attached ponzi-esque "get-rich-quick" factor of bitcoin is totally unnecessary. 


I don't think this is likely. I don't think each nation will have their own coins, nor do I think more than 2-4 coins will "survive" long term


You have to stretch your imagination all the way into another universe for a Bitcoin to be worth $100,000 considering how many are owned by thieves. That 10% of BTC alone at $100,000 each is just ridiculous, and you expect people to fund that kind of economy rather than use some alternate coin with less issues, both technical and reputation?

Bitcoin claims to be anonymous with no chargebacks. If I lend you 100 BTC, how do I prove you even own the address I sent the BTC to? With traditional finance I can make a claim to get my money returned if you choose not to repay the loan. With Bitcoin I have NO legal recourse to recover my funds.

You can't just link people to the page on scalability and claim the problem is solved or solvable. It's disingenuous, lazy, and quite frankly a cop-out of any kind of debate to simply say something was previously discussed and therefore merits no further discussion. This happens All. The.

I can answer a few of these, despite not being a fancy lawyer.
2) Customers agreed to a ToS that essentially released Gox from liability in every event. Customers are expressly responsible if Gox themselves opened their accounts and transferred money out, *it literally says this in the ToS*
10) 0%
11) Absolutely it is
12) No court of law is going to pore over the Blockchain. Bitcoin is an unregulated market, it's buyer beware. 
I strongly suggest you track down and read the ToS for the site you/others were using. It was posted here yesterday, and makes it pretty clear that anybody who lost BTC is totally fucked, anybody who lost USD also likely totally fucked.

@_date: 2014-03-25 01:16:28


I can understand this point, but those solutions still aren't scarce, right? You can start another blockchain whenever you like, and in fact many people already have 


Cool. No problems here. No reason to pay more for the use of cryptos in the future than you do today, though. For the aforementioned reasons, people can adopt until Bitcoins are used by 1000x more people than they are today, that doesn't necessitate people paying more for bitcoins for the simple privilege of using Bitcoins
Cryptocurrencies are absolutely useful. Equally so, as long as there is infrastructure (users, ATMs, merchants) to accept them. I believe you have a bit of faulty logic in that so long as a coin increases in value people will actually be inclined to hold it, not use it. This is why deflation directly influences the decision to not spend. I suspect the bitcoin economy would have in fact grown much quicker had people not had expectations of $10,000 coin and rather there was a functional, high-volume, healthy economy rather than a majority of people hoarding.

About what? The only claim I've really made is that Bitcoins are artificially hyperinflated. The praise over today's market manipulation and short-lived rise to $700 are PROOF that I'm right. There's no reasons for bitcoins to even cost $10. Literally any other alt can accomplish the same tasks and no other alt has such a terrible reputation as Bitcoin
@_date: 2014-02-21 03:23:16


Survival is not success. Overstock and Tigerdirect's acceptance of bitcoin barely affected the price, and those gains have since been lost. The speculative value is decreasing and lots of competitive alt-coins have arised, there's no reason why anybody should pay more for a bitcoin than they did the day before other than novelty or stupidity. Altcoins can essentially do the exact same job as bitcoin, cheaper, and potentially even better if an alt comes along with highly-desirable consumer protection features. Once somebody accepts bitcoin they know how to accept alts, and if you don't think there's an Altpay around the corner to compete with BitPay you're kidding yourself. 
Anything below $600 is a bargain? That's a laugh. Consider that dogecoins and bitcoins function the same for their purpose: monetary trade, buying anything but the cheapest altcoin is a waste of money. bitcoin's days of an overvaluation based on mania, hysteria and artificial, arbitrary limits are over.

Even the tea leaf readers over in bitcoinmarkets gave up on this trend months and months ago. Bitcoins popping up to $1000+ wasn't a trend, it was market manipulation with the help of a bot that bought BTC with USD that didn't actually exist. You won't see that kind of price this year, I don't think it's likely you'll see that price ever again and you're going to be *severely* disappointed if you think anybody is buying a bitcoin from you for $10,000 in 2017

The popularity isn't a result of it being a particularly polished or advanced cryptocurrency but rather the very first. I'll politely disagree with you and think everybody is greatly overvaluing the "first mover" advantage. While that's traditionally a spot where businesses can gain early ground on their competition and refine themselves, bitcoin has stubbornly stumbled into popularity and is reluctant to change. Chargeback functionality alone is *desperately* needed for mainstream success and consumer adoption, but that's totally against the Bitcoin creed. If not sheer luck I see no reason for bitcoin to be the "main" or even primary cryptocurrency for consumer use if it doesn't adapt to meet the market it wants that certainly won't adapt to use *it*


It already is, my friend. I don't believe in all the "to the moon" nonsense nor a lot of common libertarian ideals, but cryptocurrencies may indeed have a niche use for, at the very least, micropayments and though I don't think the high "premium" of Bitcoin will last long, some people have already got ridiculously rich off of what will amount in history to a speculative mania equal to the tulip bulb mania. It's fascinating stuff. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 21:50:46
If you're actually interested in my opinion:
It makes sense to me that some kind of study is done to determine roughly how many BTC need to be in circulation. 21M is a totally arbitrary number, and the value of this currency can't just be based on a random number chosen by the creator. Bitcoins work the same at $1 or $100, so scarcity shouldn't be a concern. Gold is limited by nature, bitcoin aims to simulate gold in a way, but it's a digital commodity, the rarity isn't real.
Any coin offering chargebacks, and any other consumer protection features would have an advantage
Any coin that makes regulation and tax remittance easier has an advantage (yes, I'm aware this is exactly the opposite of the reason BTC was created)
A coin with a value pegged to the USD, issued by the government, has the most "chance of success" if you ask me. I'm happy to go on if you're willing to have a mature debate, or you can PM me if you like. It's a really fascinating topic to me and though I may be perceived as "anti-bitcoin" I'm certainly not "anti-crypto" and just feel like Bitcoin has too many issues to "take over the world"

Mining investment means absolutely nothing. Every merchant talked into accepting BTC can just as easily accept another alt.

Oh, another thing I just thought of: At what time period does the exchange value "close"?

I'm "actually interested in and enjoy" discussing Bitcoins. Is that like, too hard for you to understand?


No, it isn't. I didn't say "Bitcoins aren't spent", I said "they aren't spent *like a currency*". The number of bitcoins in use compared to the number simply being hoarded **and not used at all for anything productive towards society** is crazy compared to the amount of fiat out there and the ratio of available fiat:fiat being used in the economy. There's a big difference between hoarding Bitcoins and saving cash in a bank that in turn invests your money. 
I trust this is the last time you'll make retarded assumptions about me being jealous or standing to gain from bitcoins loss. Guess what idiot? I have plenty of real money and don't care to risk any of it in bitcoins, but I still enjoy discussing the topic.

The "gold standard" of cryptocurrencies is only Bitcoin if you already own some.

It is a simple idea, it might work, that still doesn't explain to me why you thought this would prove bitcoin's superiority as a payment system.

A bitcoin company could create their own worldwide payment infrastructure if it wants to offer consumers that convenience. If Bitcoin is supposed to be a competitor to Mastercard there's no reason to let a Bitcoin-based service piggyback on their networks. 
Even more troubling is that even if the Xapo card was real it was to cost merchants the same CC fees they pay when customers use Visa or MC. The idea behind bitcoin is that transactions are cheaper, so eventually the merchant can pass on the savings, however if everyone used the Xapo card they would never see a savings, customers would actually just be paying more in exchange fees/above market rates. The Xapo card isn't (and probably never will be) real, and doesn't extoll the benefits of Bitcoin at all. It may as well be a debit card you reload with Microsoft Points or WoW Gold. 
OP, kudos to you for being realistic rather than mindless like so many other people around here. It's worth noting as well that less than a week after Xapo mentioned Mastercard they listed Bitcoins as a lobbying interest. Mentioning their company without their permission probably pissed them off enough to start taking steps towards crushing Bitcoin

...it says in plain english that it's a taxable gain. You spend bitcoins, you owe taxes on any gains you enjoyed with those bitcoins. Feel free to verify this with your own accountant. I don't know what to tell you. Read it again. Why would you be reporting something if it wasn't taxable? 
All gains are taxable. Any expenditures of more than $600 to any one vendor per year (landlord, gas station, etc) *also* have to be reported on a 1099.

Author makes some very salient points. I've voiced it a few times already and people are quick to dismiss it as "trolling" but I don't believe Bitcoin will be the most popular cryptocurrency in the future. It paved a lot of ground in the way for cryptos to succeed, but for many reasons the author mentions the hurdles between here and where many investors anticipated it being ($10,000, the moon) are just too great 
Further to this point, and another reason for a bitcoin enthusiast to scoff at my post and claim "trolling", is that once another coin is discovered to be more suitable for daily consumer use (if ever), Bitcoins value won't even have the "backing" of being the most popular and there's no way any coin like that could sustain prices even in the three-figure range.

I'll politely disagree, That was because of first-mover advantage and growing momentum. It was only after Bitcoin become "profitable" that the crop of alts popped up. I maintain there is nothing inherently valuable about the BTC protocol. 
You're hand-waiving "bitcoin will in a later update" doesn't do anything to address the 10% owned by thieves, or all the bad news behind Bitcoin. You can't update away it's reputation


Yes, Bitcoin has a loooong way to go in terms of user adoption. That doesn't mean anything for the price. bitcoins could service the entire world at $100,000,000 per coin, but I think that's one of the least likely outcomes. I think an alt with less supply issues (thefts, limit) and a less-damaged "reputation" is more likely to take over. I'm not biased towards any of them, but I think Litecoin has a better chance of worldwide success once bitcoin loses more and more momentum. It's a pretty easy opinion to have when you aren't vested in bitcoin being the only crypto. 


No, it's part of damaging the reputation of bitcoin (but not necessarily Bitcoin)

Of course, with BTC, *you* think they're worth $500 today, hopefully $10,000 tomorrow. Maybe 500,000 people worldwide think BTC are worth anything at all. The rest of the population (the majority) essentially considers them worthless.

Yeah, this isn't true. You're due tax anytime you spend your BTC, it doesn't matter if you convert to fiat or not.

Trading BTC for goods or services is a taxable event.

Most customers aren't concerned about information being stored, in fact it makes future transactions more convenient.

The problem with your thinking is that cryptocurrencies aren't inherently limited. If *every* Bitcoin owner thought they were undervalued and didn't want to sell for less than $1,000,000 each, there's nothing stopping people sending remittances in other cryptocurrencies. 
You can't just manipulate the market, people would have done that already. You can refuse to sell for less than $10,000, but someone out there will undercut you at $9,995 and then someone will undercut them. It just doesn't work like you want it to unfortunately.

There are no people at the top of bitcoin? What about the creator, who owns what would become 1/21 of the total world's bitcoin wealth? Bitcoin has wealth disparity problems, just like USD.  We honestly don't know if Satoshi is a Japanese teen or a member of a Mexican drug cartel. It makes infinitely more sense to adjust the amount to match necessary supply than simply sticking with 21M for literally no good reason and forcing divisibility. 
You need to learn what a "troll" is. I'm voicing an opinion and having a discussion. Just because you don't like what you hear or it conflicts with what you believe doesn't mean it's trolling you cad.

Okay, so where are Overstock's competitors offering BTC discounts? There's no incentive to pass on savings. I understand business far, far better than you do, I assure you. The amount of BTC customers for most large retailers is tiny compared to USD customers (less than 1% on O.co). You don't offer a discount to 1% of your customers, and I'm fairly sure any merchant doing so would get an angry letter from Visa and Mastercard pretty quickly.

Maybe you, but the majority of people here don't want to acknowledge that, because that's a gigantic factor in bitcoins "rise to the moon". You don't sound as particularly greedy as the people around here, though. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 15:39:43
Very simple answer: Nobody wants to acknowledge bad news because it hurts the potentially prosperity of the "ponzi" side of bitcoin. People see flaws in bitcoin and consider not investing, or perhaps investing in a different crypto with less issues. Most of the people holding bitcoin aren't people who believe in a reasonable future for bitcoin with niche uses, they're speculators hoping to "get rich quick" and don't want people seeing or hearing about problems. 
If you truly believed in/cared about bitcoins, the price would be totally irrelevant. They function exactly the same at $1 or $1000 so the only reason they would appreciate in value is so a bunch of early-adopter assholes can get rich. A $1 bitcoin will function exactly the same as a $5000 bitcoin so there's no real logic to an increase besides "but they're scarce!", which they aren't, really. Other cryptos aren't scarce, and an artificial scarcity isn't valuable.

Your anecdotal evidence doesn't mean anything. overstock sees less than 1% of their total sales in cryptos. I said "majority" for a reason. You may spend, and your BTC-holding friends may spend, but the majority of people are simply holding. 






Overstock less than 1%. $130k on opening day for the first giant retailer to accept BTCs (this is peanuts) and this has since dwindled to ~$15,000 per day. The evidence is there, pal, BTC is not being spent nearly as much as its being hoarded. 


Haha what the fuck ever. I haven't misrepresented anything, the people saying BTC's are "cheap" or "on sale" for $800 are the people you should be mad about. It's interesting how you have nothing to add but an personal anecdote and think that proves something.

Don't do this if you aren't positive about how to secure your wallet, bitcoin isn't a "safe" network yet and if you lose your money one way or another there's no way to recover it.

You can say "tulpfutures accidentally said couple when he meant several one time" but that doesn't have as much punch. 
I was correcting the guy, the price topped out over $1000, not $700. That's exactly why I said  


in response to

And? How profitable do you think BitPay is? The money is trivial. Trivial. TRIVIAL.


No? who gives a shit if Bitcoin owners or Dogecoin owners bought an unregulated coin that doesn't "convert"? That's not anybodies problem except them, and they knew that risk when they bought an unregulated, unbacked currency. Perhaps they can still trade within their own economy but the FedCoin in this example would obviously surpass bitcoin in use and value

bitcoin is RC Cola selling limited edition bottles for $600 each, assuring users there isn't enough soda to go around and soon bottles will be $10,000 each and everybody will have to drink each other's backwash. They also print their recipe on their website
Meanwhile, Coke and Pepsi are around the corner and they're capable of selling unlimited bottles for $2 each. There's no limit, and no price premium for said artificial limit.

It isn't a possibility. There's no service terms on Gox that guarantees your investment doesn't devalue or completely disappear. One could argue people paid $1000 for coins that were purchased under $1 each, and thus the real value of each bitcoin purchased was $1

And so will the size of the blockchain. Plus transaction confirmation times will suffer. Plus, it has to scale several-thousand times just to match ONE credit card provider. And bitcoin aims to service the whole world. I'm skeptical about how well it can scale and contend that you shouldn't be so certain it'll be a painless, flawless or even successful process.


It was one "if" and then three "ands", and you just used another big "if"


Boy does this sound reasonable and logical. Numbers don't lie! That doesn't mean a damn thing about bitcoin's viability in the market. 


A bunch of bullshit, and you know it. The price of bitcoin is based on wild speculation and I dare you to try to show a correlation between adoption and price. It's totally hysterically valued. 


dafuq? No, I'm saying any crypto has an equal chance at succeeding to bitcoin. This won't affect the value of the USD either way, as Bitcoin will never replace the USD


Wrong again. Any crypto could potentially disrupt the USD, but it would have to be a hell of a lot more fully-featured than Bitcoin. I hope you won't make me outlay the obvious reasons bitcoin won't see mainstream adoption for everyday use among consumers who give a shit about the safety of their money (99.9999999999%)


Can you please spare me this nonsense next time? thanks


Who says there's any trouble? The coins all work the same. Chargeback functionality is an obvious benefit. Honestly I could probably list ten and the fact that you say you can't think of any leads me to believe you're either totally unwilling to consider competition or you're just being disingenuous. Bitcoin is faaaaaar from perfect, the dozens of posts you see each day about people being ripped off and wallet balances vanishing is testament to that. 
Your argument amounts to "Bitcoins will be valuable because they'll save retailers money and because they were first" but neither of those things have proprietary or inherent value. Other coins/companies can come along and do the same thing, perhaps even better or cheaper.

Did you mean to post that comment somewhere else or something? You didn't explain to me how brain-dead simple it is to keep my BTC 100% safe after I buy some at an ATM. 
Listen, OP, exchanges *want* people to have lots of money available, both because they have more money on hand to spend (and gain tx fees from) but also because, as operators in an unregulated market, there's no safeguards for protecting user funds, and thus there's no liability for these exchanges when money is inevitably stolen. Charging "storage" fees might imply some sort of security is in place, or that users are paying for their balances to be protected.

What? No. Wrong. The lender obviously cares. You don't simply forgive 80% of the loan because of deflation, that deflationary growth is a HUGE part of their incentive to lend. 


Why did you bring this up? I know how the current system works. I'm talking about $100K loan where the equivalent to 300% of that is due at term SIMPLY BECAUSE OF DEFLATION, plus the interest. 
Your solution to my 25 BTC loan was "uhh maybe it could only be a 5 BTC loan". Seriously? That's not any kind of answer. Loans simply don't work. It's unrealistic that anybody could absorb the deflationary costs, so it's unrealistic that anybody would loan out BTC on any kind of large scale.

I'm not "overcomplicating" anything. You neglected to mention an entire party necessary to facilitate the transaction. 


These are your words. Completely wrong. Person B (Bitpay in this case) had to offload the coins to another intermediary first, FOR CASH, which was then used to purchase a Tesla. You're "undercomplicating" or otherwise completely ignoring a party necessary for the transaction to take place. 


No, a person with bitcoin sold bitcoins for cash and bought a tesla with that cash. Tesla hasn't ever accepted a bitcoin.

Perhaps this part is the reason I was a little vitriolic with you. Compare the price of bitcoins on any exchange to the classic bubble chart, and then tell me the world will be convinced to keep overpaying for tulips once they realize the scarcity isn't artificial. It's the exact same thing, and pointing this out is considered "fear, uncertainty and doubt". This is the only community I've ever seen use that term endlessly to describe simple logic that doesn't agree with people's analysis of bitcoins potential. There's nothing proprietary, it's just the first popular crypto, and Bitcoin already has a terrible name (not literally, I mean in the public eye)
I never said bitcoin didn't have utility, or that it will fail. I said the price won't recover even to all-time highs, and I think we're very likely going to continue dropping until the price returns to the mean from last year. Bitcoins will face competition and it's a tough sell to ask people to pay more for something that can essentially do the same thing, basically to keep overpaying for tulips.

No, you can't? Water is guaranteed to increase in value as the world runs out. Precious metals will increase in value as the world's supply depletes. Bitcoin is supposed to *increase* in value because of an artificial scarcity (literally contributed to by thieves). The gigantic, glaring problem there is that Bitcoins *aren't* rare, and never will be. Other altcoins can do the exact same job without the Bitcoin "brand name" premium that offers no significant advantage. 


I doubt this matters much. Bitcoin is absolutely plagued with issues and bad news stories, whereas other altcoins aren't so scarred.

Your section "How does this affect me" mostly discusses how it affects merchants, insinuating you'll receive discounts that most retailers don't currently offer. You also provide a solid 2.5% credit card fee despite many retailers paying as little as 1%. Interac debit purchases in Canada cost a fraction of a cent.

There's been too much bad news about bitcoin lately for it to take off like it did ever again. It's a much, much safer assumption that the average price of Bitcoin will settle back to lower, more realistic and reasonable values.

Bitcoins aren't limited, though. only "bitcoins" are. 


When you talk about people "stealing all your savings", you're talking about Gox or something, right? My bank has been safely holding money in an account for me, and in fact paying me to do so, for the better part of two decades. My job also pays pretty well. You sound pretty crazy.

Not sure what you mean here, there was a new update emailed to creditors about Gox's bankruptcy just today


You are a creditor. You need to register your claim. See the thread below for relevant links:


I take it you aren't familiar with typical bankruptcy proceedings. As per their Terms of Service, you literally gave ownership of your BTC to Gox when you deposited them. They have no legal obligation to reimburse you for assets they own. They weren't safely storing your money, they were giving worthless IOUs with no legal obligation to back them. Seriously, read the Terms of Service for the site you apparently had a bunch of money in. 
You aren't going to get back 30%. You probably won't get back 10%. The assets simply aren't there to reimburse people that much, and you can't get blood from a stone. Consider yourself lucky to get roughly 2.5% of your money back in probably the summer of 2015 or later.

To put it concisely (and blatantly steal from Mu's response in a recent thread) Log scales are useful when portraying something that grows in orders of magnitude. Not typically just 2-3 orders like bitcoin. Look at typical uses for log scales, stock prices isn't really one of them. 
If the price continues to stagnate (or decreases further) use of a log scale will make even less sense than it does now. It's really just the only way bitcoin can show a consistent growth and somewhat hide the fact that it's down more than 50%

I'm probably the most serious, objective input you're going to find around here. I don't own any crypto at all, but the recent news has fascinated me and I also spend a couple hours per day reading about it, though I'm not a "true believer" like you. I'm glad you posed the question, and though I anticipate downvotes I hope a civil, intelligent discussion can be had. 
I won't talk about DOGE specifically, but about my opinions on alternative cryptos and their place vs. Bitcoin. Bitcoin has the most momentum, the investors, and the status as "the original" crypto, but I don't think any of those things promise success in the long term. Doge and any other crypto has just as much, if not greater chance of succeeding as the mainstream cryptocurrency providing they bring more to the table for both consumers and vendors. A lot of people heavily invested hate to admit it but bitcoin has some inherent, serious flaws that other altcoins are easily able to fix and capitalize on. 
I don't think you or your boss should be counting too heavily on bitcoin or dogcoin reaching "the moon". It doesn't matter to a merchant whether they are accepting 10 internetdollars for a toaster or 100 internetdollars for a toaster, and therefore the price of a bitcoin is rather arbitrary (assuming, as I do, that it will never replace the USD and we'll never have to price things in BTC). If bitcoiners want to claim that the price should rise as a result of scarcity and their bitcoins should become more valuable, there's no reason, in my opinion as an average consumer, that we should not just use some other alt currency that doesn't have such a "low" arbitrary limit (like Litecoin)
I'll cut this fairly short since I'm pretty sure I'll be downvoted into oblivion anyway. It's my first day actually posting here and so far it's exactly what I thought it would be like. Please, redditors, don't be offended or mad at me, I'm honestly just trying to provide an outsider's perspective, you should want and appreciate objective opinions.

There's no reason for you to "invest" in bitcoin, dude. You're unlikely to see a return, and your money is a lot safer in a traditional bank. This isn't a "get rich quick" deal, that stage is over. Buy Bitcoins only if you plan on using them immediately

So they're going to hodl until the value gets back to $1,000 each right? lol. This isn't capital equipment or a trademark being sold to the highest bidder, these are digital tokens that are *absolutely* going to be dumped. They'll sell for enough to cover lawyers fees and court costs and not much more. If you honestly believe they'll delay the sale to maximize return you're worse than "a shitty troll", you're just plain stupid. 
You can call me a "shitty troll" all you want, I get that dozens of times per day here. It doesn't make what I say any less true or what you say any less false.

Err, no. Whether it's a "true distributed crypto" or not is irrelevant. If any AltCoin can provide merchants lower processing fees than Visa/MC, *that's* the appeal. it doesn't matter if Bitcoin has ENDTHEFED ideals behind it, the function is the value and the function is what people that matter (merchants) care about. 


Please be very aware that it's only the only conceivable option because you are obviously irreversible biased towards bitcoin. The true market, 99.9% of which currently don't care to touch a cryptocoin, haven't "chosen" Bitcoin and have no loyalty towards it. 


Perhaps you're the one unable to see some serious flaws here. I certainly don't require an education from a bitcoiner about how no other coin has a chance, it's a tired and biased argument. 
@_date: 2014-03-25 15:33:19
Right, because as a bitcoiner you have a misinformed notion of what "inflation" is and think it's somewhere around 10%, don't you? Lol. 
I think you'll be more lucky if your BTC is worth 50% as much as it is today by years end, but we'll see. I predict my 1 USD will still be worth $1 USD at years end, because that's what government backing and a stable economy means. In fact, I've got my 1 USD safe and secure in a US bank where it's earning more interest than I'm losing to miniscule inflation. I hope you've got your BTC in a trustworthy exchange or in cold storage where it's a hassle to use, otherwise you might not even have 1% of the value by years end. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 19:25:25


This is totally preposterous, though. You don't set 20-year loans with conditions that if value doesn't change you pay 20 BTC, but if the value increases its only 5 BTC. What if the value sinks? You skate away with a house you paid for with worthless BTC? 


I'm still listening for an explanation that is in any way reasonable. You said


and then claimed I was "glossing over your point" when I explained how things would realistically work, so maybe try re-explaining how loans are in any way feasible for a deflationary currency with no sort of backing

I didn't ask for a link to Google buddy, I asked for proof of a 50% total sales bump, and also a comparison to give you an idea of how small a 50% bump (even if it were that high) compares to Amazon's daily sales revenues. 
Comparing the dollar to the euro has no relevance to the fact that a Bitcoin works whether it's a dollar or a hundred dollars. One USD doesn't have the same purchasing power as 100 USD. I don't know why this is so hard for you to grasp.

I agree, and I'm curious to see the result. You can't deny that other cryptos can do the same thing cheaper, and I suspect the free market will realize fairly quickly there's no intrinsic value of proprietary property to bitcoin, preventing any substantial growth. Scarcity, even artificial scarcity, isn't relevant when equivalent options exist.

I see this brought up a lot. This has never happened to me or anybody I know, and if it did the losses would be insured and reimbursed. Bitcoin has no such security. 


Kind of nit-picky, but your phrasing here is strange. Maybe potential exists for this kind of fraud, but it isn't "allowed". It's insured money in case of loss but also illegal to commit this kind of fraud. Again, I've never heard of this happening to anybody. You pay for something, you get your item, end of transaction. If the merchant decides to charge me for something else I didn't ask for I can dispute the charge, my money is reimbursed. It's a non-issue.

You're wrong about that, though. What assumptions are you making about the banks not being able to offer something comparable? We both know how easy it is to clone bitcoin, and you're straight-up deluded if you think the banks would just "give up" and erode market share to BTC. 
In fact, banks in Canada are already offering pretty much anything Bitcoin does, and cheaper, so long as you aren't trying to do something criminal. Same for much of Europe. The US banking system is outdated, but it's upgradeable. 
Again, Google allows me now to transfer money FOR FREE from just my cell phone to anyone else in the US. They've **already** got Bitcoin beat in one area, they just have to expand. 
Not trying to be rude, but you're not thinking about this very hard if you don't think the banks can compete with Bitcoin. It's a bug they can squash the minute they want to, either by offering cheaper comparable services or by lobbying regulators.

You realize that whiny "but but but the USD is used for drugs too" argument doesn't get you anywhere, right?

It doesn't and won't work like that I'm afraid. People buying bitcoins, and people storing bitcoins with Gox were aware or ought to have been aware of the potential for total loss. Gox is no more liable for reimbursing the value of bitcoins they possess whether they are hacked or simply stolen by the owners of Gox. A judge would laugh this case out of court once confirming that the owner was aware that bitcoins are backed by nothing and inherently unregulated and uninsured. 
"MtGox had no right to accept the deposit" = they shouldn't have let me be a fool with my money. What a laughable legal defense. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 19:42:48


Perhaps we should both stop speculating until someone with a law degree can chime in. 
The way I see it, Mt.Gox may as well be selling drugs (another unregulated market). If I give my drug dealer $1000 in advance, he wouldn't be embezzling it if he took it and ran, and it wouldn't be fraud either. It's, similar, an unregulated space where traditional laws may or may not apply. 
Mt.Gox has no ToS with its customers guaranteeing a fair market rate, guaranteeing security of "invested" funds, they have no ToS guaranteeing anything. I'd be hard-pressed to think of which specific law they are breaking by claiming the Bitcoins they have (or you have as an account holder) are worthless, or that your money was taken by a hacker. There's no financial oversight or regulation to safeguard the funds, so they aren't breaking any regulations by having extremely unsafe storage practices
When you handed money/BTC to Gox, there's no promise made that they would secure your money, and no promise made that your BTC will retain any value whatsoever. Considering both of those factors, I don't see how they could be held liable. 
Interesting discussion, anyway

I never said they would, I suggested it's more likely they would do this than adopt anybody else's coin 


Bitcoiners drone on every day about how antiquated their payment systems are. If Bitcoin can do things more efficiently, perhaps there is something to be gained with a little capital investment. Again, this isn't something I'm suggesting they'll over do, it's far simpler to just lower the rates they charge merchants. Many use cases of Bitcoin would be DOA immediately if everybody paid what Amazon pays (sub-1%)


Bitcoin does have a single point of value, don't be dishonest. What does it cost, $1B to 51% Bitcoin? Mastercard probably has that in their corporate couch. 


No, mining is rather stupid and wasteful, it would be premined or basically only mined as necessary, assuming they bothered to use a cryptocoin at all which I think is unlikely anyway


In a dream world, perhaps. Instead, Bitcoin has become a bastardization of itself where most transactions take place off the chain and intermediaries make cuts in a protocol that was supposed to cut out the middleman. Is there a consensual agreement that the Gox coins are lost? lol


You don't say!

No, they're costly to use because there's a price to be paid for insurance, safety and security. Bitcoin advertising "no fees" is the wild west for consumers and their cash (in BTC) for precisely that reason. A tiny fraction of the world's population feels they can manage things better than industry professionals, a much larger majority of the world trusts a central authority controlling the currency to protect and insure savings and reduce the potential for losses. With bitcoin, losses are "caveat emptor, haha stupid you should have been better with computers"

Are you under the impression that lenders don't really care if they ever get repaid? You completely glossed over where I mentioned that there is NO LEGAL RECOURSE. I can claim you owe me 100 BTC but there's literally no way I can force you to give those back to me. That legal backing is 100% essential for lending. Bitcoin just doesn't work. 
No reason the mortgage process would have to change? How about lending to an anonymous figure with no chargebacks and no oversight of that spending? I don't think you quite understand how ill-fitting Bitcoin is to the lending world. 
I lend you 100BTC and two years later the loan is due and you are gone, vanished, in the wind. How do I get my payment back? I can't even sue you or have your wages garnished. 
If you really believe these issues are so easily resolved, please reply with an actual solution to the above-mentioned issues
@_date: 2014-02-11 04:25:59
In regards to your three "points"
1. The BTC sent to an "actual person" isn't being invested in BTC either. Money isn't kept, it's given to new investors to ensure the whole thing doesn't fall apart. I don't think you even quite understand how ponzis work. 
2. You can't prove anything in regards to that. Mt.Gox could easily have been doing just that, the blockchain means nothing in that regard. 
3. You can sell your bitcoins at any time? Tell that to people with BTC stuck in Gox or arrested for selling them on localbitcoins. You can't even get money out without an exchange, so much for "whenever you want". 
Oh, and every "investor" that bitcoiners talk into the ponzi is apparently supposed to expect the price to rise "to the moon" once the world magically realizes the true wealth of Bitcoin, in effect making the heads of the ponzi (satoshi, who owns 1/21 of the WORLD SUPPLY) rich

Why can't Circle just let you buy anything you want?

Customers never have to buy Bitcoins and merchant never have to accept them.

Despite the wonderful decentralized public ledger known as the blockchain, tons of people have lost bitcoin in off-chain transactions and have no idea where their stolen/lost money is. People actually encourage off-chain transactions as a way to lessen strain on the network in the future too. 
The OP basically gets it. Bitcoin is a niche product that is moderately useful, but some people fool themselves into believing it's some worldwide financial revolution, the future of money, or that the general public is interested in being their own bank. 
Or, dkmdb, perhaps you were going to start on about how the glorious blockchain can revolutionize property transfers and legal contracts.

This shouldn't be a surprise. You have something you paid $1 suddenly worth $1000, and finally a retailer who sells something you're interested in. It's no wonder bitcoin expenditures are larger than fiat ones, people were very eager to spend their BTC and especially so when you're getting essentially $900 worth of product for $1 BTC. 
Of course, since the O.co floodgates opened, sales (in BTC) have dropped roughly 90%. Elsewhere, merchants struggle to see any sales at all in Bitcoin. Bitcoin Boulevard, an entire street dedicated to BTC, saw less than 3 BTC worth of commerce total in the week they were running the trial.

A better question is why the price was so high in the first place. 1000x increases in a couple months aren't sustainable 
@_date: 2014-02-11 19:32:20
I'll politely disagree. Major retailers already began accepting bitcoin and it didn't budge the price. Most of the people willing to buy bitcoins have already done so, everybody else is waiting to see how things shake out. I don't personally see a reason why Bitcoin's price would significantly raise and would caution anybody against investing with the hopes of a profit.
I am being realistic here, I don't think other people are. Claiming that all of these issues will simply be forgotten and the price will inexplicably rise 10x or 100x isn't realistic. Every proponent of bitcoin can happily claim that a BTC will be worth $2000 by the summer, THAT"S unrealistic. Conservative estimates are realistic, praying that bitcoin will take off like a rocket amid all the bad press and insecurity is far from realistic
I'll actually ask you to back your claim. If there's a "guarantee" that the price will rise with user adoption, please find me a correlation between the price of bitcoin and the amount of people using it. If you can't find statistics or just can't be bothered to, you might as well admit there's 0 guarantee that the price will rise for any circumstances, it's all speculation and wishful thinking.

And we'll be replacing that with exchanges and merchant payment services like Bitpay, still skimming off the top. Banks provide security and insurance, bitcoin provides none of that, so I'd argue that bitcoin vendor services deserve the cut even less than Visa does. At least Visa provides some security for the money you pay them, Bitcoin gives you nothing.

Oh good god man. it's an analogy for the network effect.

Myspace thought the exact same thing about their network, and then Facebook came along and it didn't mean shit. Myspace didn't just "sell ad revenue" (what the fuck does that even mean?).

The gov. backing the USD is the one proffering these deals, why make a deal with a BTC thief? Why even bring the case to court when the person who lost BTC was aware they had no agreed-upon value by the general public, *most of which have not determined a price*

Read my post history, I've been posting the same opinions and strong arguments for over a year now. With solid and correct predictions on the direction Bitcoin has taken over the past year. It's not trolling you moron, it's just called having an interest in something without necessarily thinking it will ever be worth $10,000 or usurp the USD. I have actual realistic opinions regarding the future of bitcoin and that makes me a troll. Even sadder is that I need to explain this. 
If you don't agree that Bitcoins will be worth a billion dollars in the future and don't agree that Paypal is the literal devil then you are a "troll". The word has lost all meaning. 


You are stupid for even suggesting this. Again, it's pathetic that somebody who doesn't think bitcoin will skyrocket to the moon must be some paid dissenter. A lack of enthusiasm is seen as an affront to the church of bitcoin and everybody's bank account. Again, it's pathetic.

I think the point a lot of people are trying to raise is that by taking this road "things" may never happen. If Newegg and Dell can pay 1% processing fees via BitPay, then why would they ever directly accept? They're going to pay an employee to set up and monitor a bitcoin wallet and accept the volatility risk themselves just to save 1%? That doesn't make a lot of sense. 
Overstock has been "accepting" BTC for about a year now. They even *actually* see 10% of their BTC sales in BTC. How long do you think until they stop using Coinbase and start directly accepting? This year? Next year? For the record, if they directly accepted and held BTC received as payments this year it likely would have eliminated their profit margins on those sales due to the decline in price. So when do they start accepting this risk? Not overnight, surely, but when? 


You're naive. The argument has always been "nobody will accept it". And then a company found a way to middle-man amongst a crowd of people shouting to eliminate middle-men and now companies can "accept" BTC literally without every possessing any and that's apparently a big "win" but in the long run it's just dependence on a third-party Bitcoin was eliminated to avoid.

In your example, why doesn't Circle just never buy Bitcoins and use your own money to buy the item from the merchant and take a small cut? What's the benefit of using bitcoins if they have direct access to your chequing account anyway? Are you hoping they save the merchant 1-2% on fees? 
If you want Circle to be Paypal, why do they need to involve Bitcoins at all? Why wouldn't they use an internal CircleCoin, or better yet an Excel spreadsheet? edit - Bankerfrombtc just added another caveat - if stupid people like you think chargebacks and fraud protection are unimportant then why can't Circle just copy Paypal's business model *without the safety features* and offer the merchant a discount? Again there's no point involving a cryptocurrency. You could use Paypal if you want to be protected and Circle if you don't and either way you don't have to use Bitcoins. 
You're unironically hoping Circle copies Paypal's business model for the convenience of shopping without realizing this is exactly why most of the public will never bother with Bitcoins.

What the fuck are you talking about? The **subject of this thread** is about how Bitcoin is "backed by something". Apparently that something is the network. What good is that backing if losses aren't insured or reimbursed? How is that backing equivalent or better than fucking US GOVERNMENT BACKING in which people don't randomly lose millions of dollars without compensation. 
If the "backing" means nothing when something bad happens, it isn't really "backed" at all. The bitcoin network is self-serving, it's not a "backing" by any means and you're SOL if something bad happens, despite the totally-useful "backing" by miners.

Right, but what I'm getting at is you don't even have to hide your tracks. They can't make you give BTC back, or force you to send it anywhere. Aside from any future legal consequences of stealing BTC, essentially people are getting away scot-free, or at least able to retain any proceeds of crime. 
You can stare at your lost BTC and watch them tumble away, but you can't actually do anything to get them back once lost.

Exactly. Consumers aren't as worried about fraud because financial losses are insured. With Bitcoin, not only are there no regulations protecting your data (see: Gox) but there's no compensation for thefts. 
@_date: 2014-03-25 14:54:57
Sorry, no. You made a specific claim about how many P2P exchanges are going on, and then couldn't back up your claims. 
Keep backpedalling, you're getting better at it. 
Bitcoin is a public ledger. Why can't you tell me exactly how many p2p trades are going on? Isn't transparency the whole point of the blockchain? I'm not making any specific claims, but it's obvious to me there's a gap between the actual economic activity I see posted here and the perceived economic activity conducted by trading bots.

I'm a bitcoin "hater", so you know my answer is honest:
Microtransactions - it is apparently not feasible within the current system to send pennies. Apparently there's a market for this, and bitcoin aims to fill that gap. Too many microtransactions would overwhelm bitcoin though, the current limit is 7 transactions per second
Peer-to-peer "value" transfer - with bitcoin, you can send "value" from one cell phone to another. So people in africa can send money without needing a bank or computer. You still have to cash out to use the bitcoin though, or spend it at a bitcoin-accepting website
Currency replacement - some particularly zealous evangelists think bitcoin can replace an entire countries finances, such as in countries like Argentina with financial instability. 
"Saving on credit card fees" - merchants who accept bitcoin can theoretically pay less transaction fees than if they use a credit card. Merchants still face fees to third-party companies that convert Bitcoin to USD, lest they face the risk of bitcoin itself devaluing. 
There may be a few niche uses I'm missing but I think those are the major ones

You haven't substantiated your claim though. The best I've found is that they plan on holding 10%, I'm not seeing anything official about them actually doing so, and if they are it isn't going to be pretty when they report losses on their balance sheet. 
@_date: 2014-03-22 00:53:08


What's wrong with asking for a source? Do you have a source for your assumption? I really don't understand your hostility. The website says 5% fee, I think BTC-E is collecting that entire fee. Visa typically charges interest on cash disbursements, not a flat fee (at least not on my card)
So, **again**, source?

Pardon me, but I don't think you have any knowledge of my personal finances of any valid reason to believe I would be jealous. Also, you can see people's accounts on bitcoins and that they haven't been spent. I'd like you to provide me something since you just "guaranteed" some bullshit. The Winklevii, satoshi, and a handful of other early adopters/big investors have and are holding on to a gigantic amount of bitcoins. 
You're not just being silly, you're being stupid. Resorting to calling someone "jealous" is absolutely pathetic when you're supposed to be debating a topic.

Just as a curiosity, can you outline for me your predictions on this growth? 
We're at $315 today, you're talking about the price doubling due to the block reward in 2016. What is your prediction for the price before and after the BRH? Will we be at $1000 by mid-2016 and then $2000 following the halving? At what specific interval would you worry the market isn't having a favorable reaction to the halving? If we're at $500 at the beginning of 2016 and $525 the month before the halving would you still think the price is going to double the next month? 
You and Throwahoymatie are talking about "the price" as if its some sentient being aware of the date of the halving. The price is a function of the demand for bitcoin, and if there's a continuing lack of demand to buy bitcoins at these prices I'm failing to see why "the price" should inexplicably rise because of some arbitrarily scheduled date and not as a direct result of an increased demand to, you know, actually buy Bitcoins. 
Basic economics tell you a limited supply, when it is desired, can be valuable. Further limiting that desired supply would increase the value, but I don't really see much demand for Bitcoins at these prices let alone enough to indicate that halving the supply would directly lead to a doubling of the value. 
If the halving were to occur tomorrow I don't think you'd suddenly find people willing to pay $600-$700 per bitcoin overnight and in my humble opinion I don't think that much will occur between now and the halving that the outcome will be very different. 
I've got fifty apples to sell every day at the market and I get rid of six or seven every day for $4 each. Next week I'm only going to bring 25 apples and I've notified everybody they are going to be probably going up to $8 each. The people who didn't buy my apples before continue to not purchase my apples and the people who did buy my apples before are wondering why I'm expecting more money for a low-demand item. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 22:08:51


In what universe is that likely? In what universe are people going to lose 6% of an entire financial supply and then keep using and appreciating that system? I can appreciate that neither of us know for sure what the future holds, but I contend that it's infinitely more likely that Bitcoins will fail to appreciate in any significant manner and rather the price drops to match both the non-proprietary function of Bitcoin and it's terrible reputation. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 04:55:51


What? Why do you people always have to come up with the absolute stupidest comparisons. The USD is backed by the most powerful government in the world. Bitcoins are "just a digital piece of code".

I don't know how you could even write out the first paragraph and feel like you're arguing genuinely. Your argument amounts to "nope doesn't matter", as if it's just *okay* that thieves own a large fraction of a currency


Waiting on transactions to confirm are few and far between when a sufficient fee is attached
Hoarding isn't an issue
You literally can't make an honest argument, it's really sad. 
You honestly think


and not "why do bitcoins cost 1000x more? Oh, because it's hoarded by early adopters and 10% owned by thieves"
I'm not going to continue here, I don't know how old you are but it is downright embarrassing how bad you are at debate. You can't make an intelligent argument, your logic amounts to "nope just cause k"
@_date: 2014-02-21 18:07:39


You forgot to put the word "losing" after comfortable.
Nobody can logically articulate *why* bitcoin will rise in value, but the people who own bitcoin already and have an interest in adopting more cult members will always assure you the price is going to rise. Look at a chart of the price of bitcoins and tell me you think it's going to turn around suddenly.
The potential to lose all of this money is a lot greater than the chance for him to make a profit larger than anything a guaranteed investment could provide him today. 


and there's a far greater amount of people who will assure you bitcoin's rise to the moon is inevitable. These people are notably silent during crashes, and then act like they were cautious in the first place. 
OP, invest if you want. If you make a profit, good for you. If you lose money, you'll be here complaining about all the people who told you it was a great time to buy, and those same people (ceasefire included) will be here talking about how you were warned it was risky, or that you should have been smarter with your wallet if you get hacked. These people don't care about calculated risk or logic, they just want you to buy internet funbucks so their own internet funbucks are presumably worth more (even though major retailer acceptance didn't budge the price)

Answered your own question Jack, it's uncertain whether prices will ever rise at Gox, so you'd be taking a massive risk. Others have beat you to the punch, trading "trapped" GoxBTC for "free" BTC at a premium

good god man what are you rattling on about here. Why are you even talking about "geolocation" in regards to tax remittance? You can't have anonymous transactions with the government. 
I doubt you need to tell your relative anything. People will be taxed at the point they convert their cryptocurrency into goods or services, and if you don't have a basis for your cost you'll probably be taxed on the entire price of your bitcoin, i.e: if you sell 2 BTC for $1200 and don't have a record of what you paid for it you'll be taxed on a gain of $1200 and not $600 or whatever your actual cost was.

I never suggested that, but I find it bizarre that people are calling for regulation and culpability in what everybody should have understood is a grand experiment with no protections, insurance, or guarantees. 
Mark's official story is that the bitcoins were stolen essentially by providing thousands of individual users twice the bitcoin they requested. Whether those thousands of accounts belong to one user is unknown, but either way (according to his story) Mark isn't liable for any of the losses because a) he never promised substantial or otherwise effective security and b) he wasn't responsible for the fault in bitcoins code (whether the base or his implementation of it) that allowed this to happen.
