Many employers aren’t clear enough on your expected duties when starting a low wage job. For example I was able to finish my shifts work load in 3 hours during an 8 hour shift. When caught doing nothing I was reprimanded. For $9 an hour I was not going to help someone else with their job duties just because I finished mine efficiently. If I spoke up and said this they’d simply fire me. I did feel guilty sometimes for pretending to work for 5 of the 8 hours but I didn’t see another way.

Yeah I did, just takes them like 24 hours to respond to an email. Doubt it’d be the craziest mistake ever made with btc but I can’t really afford to have $500 disappear. Making me anxious.

True, thank you.

I emailed them before posting here and they responded with something about high volume on the btc network at the moment. I feel like that’s just a default response to my type of question though. I replied asking for the transaction ID. Waiting on that response.

I’m in no rush, I don’t need the money asap or anything. It’s just they said it was processed and I still didn’t receive them so I’m wondering if I did something wrong. Although there’s not much room for error you just copy and paste the address. 
Gambling codes? Like the algorithms that set the lines? No it’s not fair, not for them when you know how to beat them.

If they had sent the money would there at least be an unconfirmed transaction listed in my wallet? Does the lack of anything mean they haven’t really sent it yet or I did something wrong?
@_date: 2019-02-13 13:21:11
They didn’t. I’ll request it from them, thank you. Is it a bad sign that there’s no unconfirmed transaction though? Does that mean it was never sent or I did something wrong? 
Also, the address changes, but does a certain address always work for whatever wallet it was for...to clarify I copy and pasted my address (call it address A) into their website and it said “please provide a valid btc address.” I refreshed the address and used the new one (address B) which worked. If I went and used address A for a separate and new transaction would it still be a valid address? Sorry if that was confusing but I was just curious about this too.

Thanks mate!  I called and got it all sorted out.

Ok, thanks for replying. Definitely not a scam site as I’ve used them for years and have been paid out before. Just started using btc on it though.

It’s not even showing up in my wallet at pending/unconfirmed though
@_date: 2019-12-19 22:07:56
I know
@_date: 2019-12-19 22:21:45
There’s nothing to search it just says in progress to my wallet address.

I’m on the east coast. Thank you though :)

I pasted my wallet address in it said not results found

What about withdrawing funds from a gambling site into your coin base wallet? I’ve withdrawn a little over 5K from bovada to coin base then cashed it out to my paypal account and have been fine so far. It’s only been a couple months though.

I’m not smart enough I guess because I can’t make sense of that chart
@_date: 2019-05-11 04:40:25
I rly do. The bitpay debit card isn’t working for ATM withdrawals at the moment which is crazy. It only works as credit.
@_date: 2019-05-11 06:32:24
Thank you.
@_date: 2019-05-11 06:36:20
Ok thanks
@_date: 2019-05-11 04:13:58
There’s one :)

Cool thank you.
