Yep that's the problem I'm trying to work out where I might have gone wrong, it could be that I capitalized a non-cap the good thing is I think it is just one letter that I accidentally capitalized. But then again with the one missing character plus having to noncap that letter would mean 3162 combinations again (I don't mind doing that again). Worst case scenario I could have messed up on 4 characters that could be either caps or noncaps that puts the combinations more than 100000. I don't mind the computation power and leaving it to run for time that's not a problem. knowing myself it's a very small mistake I have made, it's just I'm not sure 100% where I've made it. I was really hoping that extra character would have got me the right key.

Thanks for the heads up

Could you send me a full working script please.
@_date: 2017-12-30 11:55:12
Thank you for the help, so I ran the script and see it working but it doesn't print the key at the end. How would I get the correct key at the end?

Ok thanks for that, I'll check them manually will take me a while hopefully one of them is correct.

That's what I was thinking as I looked at other posts and someone used python to get a combination. If any one can create a skript for me and instructions on how to use python that would help and they will be rewarded.

Yea that would be great, I don't mind however long it takes. I am a character short, now the problem is whether I have put down the same character twice which I don't think I have done. (lets just say for instance 49 characters were correct and 2 of them were wrong would this still work?) I'm pretty sure 70% that I have just missed out one character (praying to God) so it's just a matter of time before I get the key.

Yep I'm stupid :(

Thanks alot appreciate your help I'll look into bitcoin core. I really hope I am right :)

I just know that one is missing and I'm so careful with these things but I guess mistakes happen. Basically my plan was to add a number, A-Z and a-z after every character and see if that works. But there is probably a quicker way to do that sorry but I'm a total noob with skripts and stuff. Yes please if you could do that for me that would be great and if the key works I'll reward you.

Thanks I'll check this out

bad news I tried all 3162 combinations none worked :( so I've missed a character plus I've either mixed up two other characters or I've misplaced one character with the wrong one. It's got really complicated now, no way can I manually enter 100000+ combinations into blockchain takes way too long I struggled putting 3162 in. Not sure what to do now any suggestions? btw is the private key calculated from the bitcoin address? as I have the correct bitcoin address and I partially have I would say 90% correct private key. So maybe there is a way of brute forcing this.

Thanks man you've been a great help.
