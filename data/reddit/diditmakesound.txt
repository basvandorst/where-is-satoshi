*Text for those that prefer it:*
It has been a year and a half since we enabled customers to buy with bitcoin on our website. I felt it would be useful to write an overview of how it compares to our other payment methods and our general experiences / insight. I first got into bitcoin at the end of 2012 and my previous startup was in the industry. As a retailer, we can see the direct impact price has over how likely someone will spend their bitcoins and its benefits in terms of payment processing fees charged by financial institutions.
 Bitcoin as a Payment Option - Is it worth it?
The short answer is yes! There are many reasons to accept bitcoin as a payment option. First off, additional revenue. **We have received $7,402 worth of bitcoin orders since launch**. A large majority of that is likely from purchases that we would not have received if we hadn't added it. From a financial perspective, it makes a lot of sense.
The bitcoin community is filled with very loyal and supportive people. They love seeing websites accept BTC on your store and their online communities (most notably allows open discussion about purchases made with bitcoin and the stores that accept them. That community is currently followed by over 175,000 subscribers and is a worthy marketing channel. The biggest factor to increasing bitcoin sales is interacting and catering to that community and making their experience amazing. I personally am a part of it so it was easy but in practice it should be simple for newcomers as well.
*Pro-tip: We don't recommend spamming your links on their boards. The best way to market to redditors is to 1. introduce the fact that you're accepting bitcoin, 2. give them a customer experience worth telling friends about. Email your bitcoin customers just to say hi and discuss it. We take a different approach in general with our customer/community relations and feel getting personal is the best method for success.*
*You can really standout and gain fans by making products specifically for the bitcoin community. We licensed and sell [a funny bitcoin shirt]( based on a popular ad campaign on reddit.*
We receive our largest amount of bitcoin sales during [Bitcoin Black Friday]( which is an event catered towards special bitcoin discounts. Signing up to BTC Black Friday is free and simple as well. Marketing-wise, it has been a common practice to announce you accept bitcoin as a standalone PR agenda as well. News websites are more likely to pick the story up (although we personally don't interact with the media ourselves, I know we could leverage it if we wanted to). Overstock has done a specifically remarkable job at this.
Lastly, the fees are at least half (or zero if you accept it directly without a third-party service) of standard payment processors. We have [Coinbase]( integrated into our website and **our fees are only ~1%**. It gets a little more complicated when tax season comes, so additional expenses may occur if you liquidate the bitcoin into fiat cash. In the US, selling your bitcoin sales under 1 year are taxed at your regular income bracket which can dramatically increase the cost. We personally HODL (common joke on the term "holding" your bitcoin) onto the bitcoin from sales, so we haven't incurred these tax implications.
 Processing Fees Compared to Paypal
I was shocked and rather pissed off earlier this year after completing a full financial analysis of our revenue and expenses. I learned that Paypal was charging us ~5%... 5% of all payments made through their damned service... in fees for the privilege to use them. I realized that having a merchant account didn't lower your fees compared to being a regular member. You have to dig into the settings and click one button to turn on the lowered fee prices. After doing so, we are now charged ~2.6% in sales fees.
This is pretty standard for regular payment processing but I felt the way they handle this is a scam. The fact that having a merchant account doesn't automatically give you merchant fees is ridiculous. If you use Paypal for sales, dig into the settings and make sure this is turned on.
 as a Percent of Sales
Bitcoin isn't going to make a huge impact on your business unless you leverage it to gain widespread media attention. For us, it has still been worth it for the marketing opportunities and ability to service a group of people we identify ourselves with and love.
Bitcoin only totals about half a percent of our total sales this year, but every sale counts. We also are in the low-margin high-volume industry of apparel so it makes sense that our total sales would be on the low end. Businesses that cater to a higher-end customer and commodities like rare metals will likely see a larger increase.
We have noticed a dramatic difference in the number of sales from bitcoin based on bitcoin's current price. When the price is "undervalued" or people are down on their initial investment, they spend less. When the price is up, especially during price surges, **we see bitcoin sales almost daily**.
Overall, bitcoin in 2015 is a great value proposition. **We saw bitcoin sales grow from 2014 to 2015 by 20.4%** and I anticipate that to only increase in the future as the payment method becomes more trusted and widespread. Personally, I am bullish on bitcoin's price going above $1,000 again, so the bitcoin we have received from orders hopefully will continue to increase in value as well. We are up on our position overall. Shirts sold during 2015 have sometimes doubled in their value as the price fluctuates.
We will continue to accept bitcoin as one of our three payment methods and can't wait to see what happens in the future.

Notice how no core devs are part of any of these discussions. Nothing has been learned. The only one I saw came in to squabble with idiots and announce he's quitting. I don't prefer that, but non-diplomacy isn't an option right now. We don't have a structure in place to make fair decisions on the future of development.
You can try and convince yourself that staying with them "for the sake of the kids" is a good idea, but so far it's the same ol' abusive relationship.

If/when the stock market crashes, I will be looking to invest in water related companies and gold/silver mining companies. Does anyone know which industries surged when 2008 crashed? I'd like to research.
If/when COMEX falls apart or something causes real gold value prices, I'll invest in those commodities (assuming I don't get in too late).
I have no real strategy for Chinese crashes but I'd be open to ideas to research. I see a very real likelihood of their currency losing value, their controlled stock market experiment straight up failing (they have a fairly large cash surplus but are burning through it like wtf fast right now), and/or their housing market and ghost cities finally crash and destroy their rising low/middle class.
They have entire cities built to fuel growth and are completely empty. If the Chinese gov needs to keep using their cash to boost their "*private*" sector, I think the housing investment pyramid/gamble they built could crash in a big way. Compound a few of these... and uh oh.
@_date: 2016-01-19 05:26:14
I hate to suggest someone not join the revolution, but this is either a great time to buy or a *really* bad time. The risk is even too disproportionate for me... and I buy on a lot of downtrends.
As a newcomer, the unresolved problems facing bitcoin right now will be extraordinarily hard for you to catch up on. I can barely even recommend trying, so I can't really recommend someone buying into such a complex uncertainty.
Bitcoin will be here a year from now - for that I am certain - but this next month or so is going to be walking the line of disaster.
@_date: 2016-01-05 22:57:21
I've been hearing about it for years. The main investments are in water-service companies, companies that own the pipes themselves, and bodies of water.
I am not invested in any of it. It would be a thing to look at since water is an obvious necessity of life. If the stock market collapsed, a long-term bet on water could be the time to buy. That's really all I'm saying... is that a collapse could be an opportunity for long-term investments like that.
@_date: 2016-01-05 21:58:27
I'll be watching and act accordingly. I am not investing what I can't afford to lose and have been through 3 bubbles at this point. Even without the implosion of the world economy, I would be bullish on 2016. 
I believe our governments are so tricky with finances, they'll likely be able to postpone the inevitable for a long time still. If or when it happens... it's going to be a major disaster. We didn't even fix the initial problems from 2008. Seriously, what the ever-living fuck.

Bitcoin is a deflationary asset. This means that we know how many there are and it's not tied to a single government. If USD crashed, bitcoin would likely increase in its buying power because of its independence and gold-like characteristics.
@_date: 2016-01-18 20:02:54
To be fair, we don't own the term blockchain. It'll likely have different "genres" per-say to cater to different needs. I don't actually mind the banks using blockchain - it was inevitable and is happening way sooner than I thought. If we can fix our issues at home, their use of the same technology regardless of their vocal attacks will bring more credibility to bitcoin.

Why's this? The grid going offline or something? If it's an independent store of wealth, I would think the opposite would happen. In this scenario of total disaster (which I don't think will happen), real gold and PE (precious metals) would probably be king.
@_date: 2016-01-08 22:55:53
All I'm saying is that there are a lot of impressionable first-time investors, young people, dim-wits, etc on these forums. It's not particularly responsible to claim the price is going to $4,500 without disclaiming how unlikely it is.
Someone motivated to buy from the illusion of a $4,500 coin this year is also likely the person that panic sells.
@_date: 2016-01-10 03:37:18
Liquidity is already there. Buying and selling bitcoin is really simple, especially compared to something like physical gold - it's closest asset relative.
It's finding valuable uses for it, successfully adapting the code to help scalability, educating the masses, and having longstanding trustworthiness.
@_date: 2016-01-10 03:39:28
I think you're right. I know some of the laws changed in regards to crowdfunding, but I doubt that effected direct sales of common stock. I believe common stock sales require permission from a company's board members too.
@_date: 2016-01-08 04:35:39
It's just a store of wealth right now. Just needs the market cap to make it viable for larger players. Try buying and selling physical gold... it's a pain in the ass. This is superior for the same type of buyers.

@_date: 2016-01-05 22:00:51
Just curious - are you bearish on the devs being able to solve these issues? What do you think would be the major trigger (so I can watch out for it and read more)?
I assume the biggest would be a bad implementation of some rule changes that break it. Even in that scenario, I think it'd rebound over time once brought back, but potential mainstream investment would almost entirely dissipate. If bitcoin can make the changes and be solid for 3 more years (a decade), I think we'll be in really good shape for the mainstream.
@_date: 2016-01-08 21:56:17
$4,500 is realistically too high. Even if it hit that, that'd be my personal prediction of about the maximum another bubble would go. So, even if it went that high I would have already likely sold out.
@_date: 2016-01-10 22:12:51
True, I have been spoiled with Coinbase.
@_date: 2016-01-07 10:38:49
These is a correlation but it's not direct. Look at gold in the past 5 years... particularly after QE ended. It's speculative by nature and smart people control what they can.

He really should heed your suggestion...
@_date: 2016-01-05 22:50:13
I agree with you but I feel like those are things that can be "not great and ignored" or added through sidechains. In terms of bitcoin's value in the face of financial crises, I think they're secondary and new adopters trying to find a place to store their wealth wouldn't be buying it as a currency.
The real issue is whether bitcoin can adapt to the scalability issues. I'm confident that the devs can do it but I will admit that I am vastly uninformed on the topic.
Bitcoin straight up failing will be human caused though. I am advising people I care about to be mindful of their money and get rid of debts and don't/can't recommend bitcoin as the option. It's just one of the tools I am personally hedging with.
I'm going to look for medium articles and writeups on these current issues though. The money I have in BTC depends on me doing my research.  I'd also like to just shoutout a thanks for the well-thought replies that don't contain FUD. I appreciate it and a community like this needs it.
@_date: 2016-01-07 10:34:50
You are much better off investing it in bitcoin right now. I was bullish about it in 2016 to begin with but with global economies imploding as well... it's going to be one hell of a year financially in general.
@_date: 2016-01-05 21:52:38
Education will be the most important factor there. That said, if currencies and markets are failing and bitcoin is rising... they'll find out sooner or later.

If Coinbase didn't exist, I likely wouldn't buy in the quantities I do. Especially with as much ease. Does everyone forget the old days where you had to send money orders and checks?
@_date: 2016-01-05 23:11:28
Yeah, I have been reading into it a lot. I am very motivated to buy PMs but I am also convinced that unless there was a complete disaster in that market... the powers-that-be will keep control over it.
On the flip side, if prices go down much further then I'll think the banks are shorting it and could let it rebound. The only reason I haven't taken a gamble on that scenario is that those same financial institutions have a lot of motivation to keep gold/silver/etc prices down so they look bad to investors. Helps keep the stock market soaring. Also, cash is basically free for them so there's no incentive unless the dollar itself become unstable.
I don't know enough about the gold/silver markets to really understand whether it's been overpriced since the "gold bug rush" and is leveling out or if it's just market manipulation bound to soar again. I do believe (especially gold) is going to obviously remain a savvy store of value. 
Most articles are written by gold bugs and they've been entirely disheartened in the last few years. I need to make up my own mind, I suppose, on real gold/PE holdings since they all think the price has gone back to pre-2006 levels entirely due to manipulation.
The question is whether the paper-gold notes will implode so the real market can take over. COMEX is backed by the government so I personally doubt it will. Investors will likely keep buying paper notes, even if the vaults run completely dry, because of the ensured bailout from the gov. I'd probably even be buying AU over BTC if COMEX didn't exist.
Another reason I haven't pulled the trigger is that international currencies may continue to become unstable and strengthen the USD. If the USD remains trusted/strong, and we don't have fed/debt issues, then gold likely will remain less appealing to investors. There are so many potential financial issues, it's hard to pick which thing to hedge with.
@_date: 2016-01-05 22:19:17
I love reading ZH but that site is wrong (on their predictions) and contradict their own articles VERY often. I'd read them still but research further to get full understanding.
@_date: 2016-01-11 20:04:52
True. Bad reference aside... I think it gets my intention across.
@_date: 2016-01-05 23:18:17
I'm looking at other options and I likely will put some wealth into a few different things. In a few other comments I've gone into why I am withhold on investing in PEs at the moment. I still might, at least a little. Diversification seems more important than ever right now since there are so many potential disasters that it's hard to predict what you're hedging against. All of them?
The thing most appealing to me about bitcoin right now is that the price is one of the most transparent forms of investment I've found. Advice is appreciated from others though.
@_date: 2016-01-08 18:34:58

I initially used GoCoin so I could accept doge and whatnot but that seems like vaporware at this point. BitPay is integrated with Shopfiy now. Coinpayments.net too, which is fairly new.
It's not so easy to directly accept bitcoin securely and there are strict limits on how payments operate on Shopify. In general the tech companies act as guardians more than ever which limits my choices.
Edit: I see your edits. I view Coinbase as a positive on-ramp for crypto. The nice thing about bitcoin is the human rights elements I care most about are baked into the software itself. It doesn't really matter what people do with it and I support an increase in market share for the space overall. 
They may eventually take it over similar to how the internet has so many monopolistic companies on top but TCP/IP remains neutral. I view Bitcoin similarly.
I'm always on the fringe of privacy rights and whatnot, so I hear you on the worries, but it's up to the user to decide how they implement the tech. In terms of online retail, a payment provider is necessary for all the moving pieces.
@_date: 2019-10-30 20:27:31

I suggest writing it like a good resume.
Keep it a concise and meaningful synopsis of who you are and what you've done. I use bulletpoints for the actual results. Some of my previous projects and current company is rather *impressive* (eh) as I've gotten older, so I can portray my ability to execute well with a fairly diverse skillset.
I wouldn't recommend fluffing it since anyone with some intelligence knows how to spot bullshit. My background on this stuff was interviewing people when I was in finance at a Fortune 500 company.
EDIT: Also, the more "fluff", pointless sentences, pompous descriptions of yourself... can easily counteract the benefits. For me and pretty much anyone in my circles, we can tell if a person is bullshit like a sore thumb.
Zero grammatical errors and confusing sentences too. I suggest re-reading it and making it more concise and better for a good while after first completing it.
Feel free to PM me to review if you'd like.

Give gold when there's bitcoin on the streets, even if the bitcoin is yours
@_date: 2018-11-27 04:31:31


My smartest friend was mining from his PC in the early days. He donated all of his coin away before they were really worth anything though. My brother started one of the first exchanges called Coinsetter which exited to Kraken. He's awesome. They both bot my into it and I started a Bitcoin company in 2013.
That company didn't amount to anything or raise money but in the darkest times when I was ready to give in, I saw a post on the front page of Reddit called ["4chan designs some shirts"]( (warning: very NSFW). I loved the idea... completely anonymous t-shirt design ideas... and started a company. I've been running it ever since. Last year I got back into crypto helping projects with their team leadership, community building, and strategy. Link to our crypto group [here](
Now I'm here today. You can learn about all of the crazy changes going on in my life [here]( which also would explain my positive attitude here too.


I saw it as a currency and investment. My friends already were starting that exchange I mentioned since 2013. It was such an awesome time! Everything was totally uncertain and speculative but everyone knew it was revolutionary. Keep in mind that our economy was shaky as fuh' back then. **People were drawn to Bitcoin in the poor economy. I may be wrong but it's about to happen again.**
I missed the time Satoshi was around though.


Never been more certain of it's future.

Bingo right here. They are showing you what they hold value towards and in this picture it's not their aesthetics.
That said, this is showing three men in casual wear and trying to make moral claims from it. I've seen Bill and Jack Ma in suits. It also doesn't mean successful rappers with crazy swagger are wrong either.
People should just wear what speaks to them. Clothes are an outward expression of how we feel inside for many of us. I wonder if Zuck is very in touch with his feelings?

If decentralization is part of our future, they will be major. I don't see politicians fixing our "trust" problem. Trust in people and established systems is decaying right now. Plenty to be bullish of if you can look far enough ahead. The alternative is authoritarianism and centralization. We're witnessing how well that plays out right now. We've seen it time and time again throughout history.

It's not even just competitors. It's obvious the landscape won't have one "winner". Many coins provide different utility. At minimum, there is no future that Bitcoin replaces ethereum for smart contracts and as the blockchain that companies can launch their own ICO to gain investment and liquidity.
So, what's your question even supposed to represent? Peer pressure?

You don't have to agree with everything a person says. Common sense would suggest anyone you may like, respect, or love will have qualities and ideas you both like and defy your logical reasoning.
Peterson is obviously doing his best to spread a positive message. He's obviously a good person, even if off-base on some things. Why not respect a man for being so brave and just provide your clarifications constructively?
Instead you just say "fk him" and then argue with people. Are you a professional troll?
