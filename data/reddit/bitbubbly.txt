The log chart is the only one which really matters, because it preserves percentage changes in value.
Example: 
1) You have $100 in BTC, when 1 BTC = $40. BTC drops to $30. You now have $75 in BTC.
2) You have $100 in BTC, when 1 BTC = $400. BTC drops to $300. You now have $75 in BTC.
Do you not understand this? Even though in the first example you had 2.5 BTC and the second you have 0.25 BTC, the percentage change of price is what is relevant. That is what log-charts help to show.

Nice asstimate.


Not really semantics when the whole argument you're pushing is "Merchant adoption drives price downwards" and the merchants adopting bitcoin doesn't affect the price of Bitcoin at all...
If you had instead made the claim "People cashing out their bitcoins are driving the price downwards" then I would have agreed. Not quite the same claim, though.

Even if you successfully "double-spend" the coins to an address of your own like you describe, you **gain nothing**. The only way to benefit from a double-spend is to trick someone else into thinking you have paid them, and then cause the "fork" upon which you paid them to be the shorter chain, by mining on the alternate fork. Thereby "un-paying" them.
If you do it with 2 addresses you own, you didn't double-spend against anyone. You just dicked around with some coins for a minute.

There are "pruning" options that are being looked into, to see about reducing the sizes of the block-content needing to be stored, but it is probable that even with incredibly-successful pruning methods in place, the blockchain continues to grow rapidly in size. The higher number of transactions that the network is expected to handle will make this growth inevitable.
The idea is that storage costs will continue to get cheaper and cheaper according to Moore's Law, so the hundreds of GB that the blockchain consists of will be dirt-cheap to store by the time it is that large.
As for the timeline of the pruning implementation... software development timetables (especially in decentralized software development) are hard to predict.

It's easier to identify humor they typically *don't* enjoy, e.g.:

Jokes where the punchline is a loud/obnoxious noise (like a shriek or scream)
Repetitive and unoriginal non-sequitirs (such as most of posts)
On the other side of the spectrum, there are plenty of types of humor that are typically appreciated by intelligent/intellectual persons, but the correlation is not 1:1 and it is certainly possible to be an intellectual and *not* like one or more of the following:
Wordplay (e.g. puns)

Your point is basically "dollars change in value too!" and completely inane or at the very least trivial. Also you're misusing the word "pegged" - it means "fix (a price, rate, or amount) at a particular level" which is not at all how you're trying to use it.
Yes, the dollar is inflationary. So what? 
I think you're under the impression that you've gleaned some revolutionary insight that the rest of us have yet to fathom. The problem is, we all already understand that the dollar is inflationary and it is not that difficult to run through the simple implications of that fact.

3) Only 20% of bitcoins exist
4) The War on Drugs is over
5) Bitcoin will either become a commodity and never transacted, which would destroy its utility entirely and thus render it worthless... or it will become a currency that "has to be worth basically nothing" in order to be successful as the "True Global Currency... The Most Pure, and Effective Currency The World Has Ever Seen" - never mind the inherent contradiction/paradox in the latter scenario.
6) Gold is "bad at being money" not because it is cumbersome to transport, but because it is valuable.

There is no advantage to blockchain technology *except* decentralization.
As a payment-processing-platform, it is much, much less efficient than a centralized system. The only reason to use a blockchain, *at all*, is to have things verifiable in a decentralized manner.

Second off, I notice you have yet to respond to [my earlier post]( which provides additional evidence of people calling the Internet a fad.
Seriously. You lost this one. It's best not to respond when things go this far south; you're embarassing yourself and the Buttcoin community at large.

"Run out of arguments"? 
1) I have never "run out of arguments" - I can't even remember the last time anyone has been able to keep up with me when an argument has begun. I dance in circles around morons who try to challenge my throne. Case in point: this thread.
2) I never resort to personal attacks. I keep it classy, above all else. Now, with that said, if a redditor is a moron, I will do my duty and make it abundantly clear that this is the case. For instance, in this very discussion, you've tried desperately to deflect the conversation down some weird path that only you're interested in... this is a weak tactic, and instead of following you down that path, I've kept things grounded and stayed on-topic.
When you try some lame-ass middle-school tactic like "If you don't respond that means you lose ok?" then you deserve to have that tactic turned around and used against you, you creepy feces-muncher. Don't hate the player, hate the game.

No, it **objectively** is not. Vendors don't have bitcoin to add selling pressure in the first place. If you're going to make the argument that bitcoins being used to buy goods are adding selling pressure to the markets, then you have to admit that it is **the people who are using those bitcoins who add that selling pressure**. 


I know that merchant adoption has not significantly hurt the price because there has not been any serious sales volume through these merchants who have "adopted" Bitcoin, so the dumps that we see on the exchanges can't be due to them. That's just **objective**.

I'm going to read a couple paragraphs of the whitepaper. Let's see how it fares.


LMFAO. "Peercoin improved upon Bitcoin" - already, off to a bad start. There are a lot of problems with Proof of Stake. Huge, fundamental problems. This is already a laughable whitepaper.


Have I ever seen an argument this terrible? Yes, a few times, actually. But usually in half-assed quickly-typed-up reddit comments by morons who aren't thinking too hard about what they write. Certainly not in a whitepaper.


And yet here you were, telling me how "there's NO pump and dump with NuBits" - it's almost as if you didn't realize that NuBits **are the pump for NuShares**. In other words, you're welcome for identifying the scam you fell for, dumbass. You owe me.

Mind elaborating what those benefits are? I disagree.
@_date: 2014-10-20 16:46:39
Ok, I give you points for trying. Solid effort.
Now, entertain the following line of thought to see why your "zero sum" argument is not necessarily true: [gains from trade]( yield benefits that would otherwise go unrealized. In other words, a world in which societies trade will have more prosperous inhabitants than one in which they do not. And a world in which the mechanisms/media through which this trade occurs is more efficient will yield more prosperity than one with less efficient means of trade. The technology of money itself improved the efficiency of trading vastly over that of a barter-only system, and the result was a society (or network of societies) which benefited from the realized efficiency improvements. The net effect of the invention of money was *not* zero sum.
Now, assuming Bitcoin *is* a more efficient money technology than that which preceded it, it is perfectly reasonable to conclude that it will further harness such benefits (and distribute them to network participants). **Of course, it's entirely possible that Bitcoin is not more efficient money, as its proponents argue, but this is besides the point I'm making, which is that the assumption that it is zero-sum is just that: an assumption.** 
If you want to prove Bitcoin is zero-sum, you have to first prove that it's inferior monetary technology. Even that is not truly rigorous and it does not necessarily follow that it is a zero-sum proposition, but it would be a good start.
In short, you did a good job making an argument, but it fails to take a great deal into account by making the very-flawed assumption that using Bitcoin is absolutely equivalent to using another currency or commodity or network when it comes to exchange of value.
Read some Nick Szabo.

Are you arguing with Bitcoin versus an altcoin, or Bitcoin versus fiat? You seem to be trying to have it both ways.
Couple the network effect with a financial stake and you have a fundamental discrepancy between Bitcoin:MySpace/xCoin:Facebook... the ["switching costs"]( of going from MySpace (one free service) to Facebook (another free service) are nil. The same cannot be said of going from Bitcoin to xCoin.
As for Bitcoin versus fiat, sure, fiat has a much bigger "network" and so benefits from the network effect vastly moreso than Bitcoin. In fact, that's arguably the single biggest advantage that fiat has over Bitcoin. But that market is saturated, and supply continues ballooning rampantly, whereas the same cannot be said for Bitcoin. Not to mention the other perks of BTC over fiat, which I'm not going to bother outlining because it's been done thousands of times in this sub and I don't particularly support Bitcoin anyway.

Well, if Bitcoin is potentially positive-sum, those benefits will be realized by individuals who use the system. The net value to society as a whole would still manifest on a microscopic/individual level.
Sure, plenty of individuals would lose money along the way, and people would find themselves on the shit-end of trades all the time, but in the end, *if* it's not zero-sum (and fortunately we both seem to realize and acknowledge that this is a big supposition and certainly no guarantee), then it's going to ultimately yield more profits than it does losses. It is, of course, up to the individuals trading it to maximize their particular profits as this occurs.

That's a different question, chump.
I'll bite, though: your argumentative style. Your inability to recognize when you are outmatched. Your inability to parse simple statements and understand them in context. Your constant misquotations. The fact that you frequent (which actually tells me more than the fact that you're a moron: it also tells me you're a misogynist and most likely a lonely one... people who have healthy sexual lives don't frequent desperate subreddits like that). The fact that you are "quite certain" about things that aren't actually true.
It's not that hard to recognize a moron. I've stared into the abyss that is for long enough to know the signs. 


You're the one calling me disingenuous. I'm bona-fide, mothafucka.

Not really, but it seems to do the job of making you feel worse about yourself pretty darn well, as evidenced by your adorable little treatise here.


It's really weird that you keep projecting like this. What, pray tell, am I weaseling out of? It's *you* who has repeatedly tried to deflect and change the subject. As you can see, I address each of your points thoroughly. Meanwhile, you try (desperately) to salvage your dignity by constantly trying to change the focus of the conversation. 
You're actually right smack dab in the middle of a technique that so many Buttcoiners have tried before you: "If I can change the subject or psychoanalyze this guy, maybe I'll distract him from the fact that I have made a fool of myself so many times during our exchange!"
It doesn't work. It never works. On the plus side, you're back to being entertaining, because your desperation is palpable at this point. You need this so bad. You just want me to make a mistake *so, so* bad, don't you? Don't hold your breath.

Yeah, distributed consensus is a tricky problem to solve, and there are huge costs to that. Proof-of-Work at least achieves meaningful distributed consensus. Proof-of-Stake, nehhh.
"Proof of Stake - the cheaper alternative, that doesn't actually address the issues that Bitcoin was invented to address!"




What does that have to do with how terrible of an argument that is? The argument is: "Let's assume volatility drops. Then volatility should rise because people won't make dividends!"
That is absolutely mind-bogglingly stupid. It's like a middle-schooler came up with the argument. Of course volatility sucks. That's not the point. The fact that you don't understand what the point *is* speaks volumes.


And I tried to show you that, once again, **NuBits are the pump for NuShares.** They're the mechanism through which NuShares are pumped. Even when you have someone holding your hand and clearly outlining why it is a pump-and-dump scam, you are unable to see this obvious fact. I can only show you why the thing is broken, I can't do your critical thinking for you, child.


This is getting rather pathetic, don't you think? I mean, you're not *actually* convinced by the "if they give money to the wrong people, they should in theory one day suffer for doing so" argument, are you? It's a fucking pump-n-dump, you chump. No one is worried about shooting themselves in the foot, they're concentrated on getting more money from victims like you.


You sound like the idiots who fell for the BitSharesX scam. Honestly, BitSharesX is better than NuBits/NuShares/NuScams in a lot of ways. It's still a cleverly-disguised pump-and-dump, but at least BitSharesX has a semi-tenable whitepaper that doesn't sound like it was written by a 13-year-old.

Con artists are often clever. In this case, he was clever enough to fool you. Definitely nowhere near clever enough to come up with an idea with actual utility, though. And nowhere near clever enough to write a credible whitepaper. 
I'm sorry you fell for it. Good luck in reaching the exit before the others.

He totally should have fixed the whole "user error" problem before releasing this beast. I mean, that's just shoddy worksmanship, if you ask me! The possibility of someone messing something up in some way should be entirely eliminated before anything is debuted. I just don't get how he didn't see that someone might be able to make a mistake later on down the line, take that into account, and put in safeguards that absolutely prevent it from happening. The guy was an idiot; that much is obvious. If he were here right now, I'd probably slit his throat for omitting to 100% idiot-proof the system. The nerve!

There is **no** advantage to a blockchain that is centralized. You clearly don't understand what a blockchain does or is designed for. 
It would just increase costs, and confer **absolutely no benefits whatsoever**. A blockchain doesn't magically reduce transaction costs. It simply achieves consensus in a distributed environment with actors who don't trust one another.
It is very clear you don't know of any actual "benefits" because if you did, you would provide an example. There aren't any. You lack fundamental understanding, and are doing an excellent job of displaying your naivety to the world.

No one asked you to "write a paper" - I'd be interested if you could produce a single piece of logic that would lead you to believe the (in my opinion utterly ridiculous) notion that Satoshi destroyed a million bitcoins for the lulz.
...but nah, best to just skirt away from the original silly premise. 
One last little snack-for-thought for you: ever consider that Satoshi may have been concurrently mining on another, less-obvious setup (much less hashpower with a standard "signature") and that he's cashed out a bunch of coins already? If I were the creator of Bitcoin and valued my anonymity, I'd certainly pull a stunt like that. I doubt this scheme occurred to me but not him.
@_date: 2014-09-14 12:25:54


Not necessarily, though. That would be assuming that every single mined coin is sold immediately on the open markets.

The null hypothesis is that gold continues to be coveted, as it has been for millennia. The onus is on you to provide sound logic for why this would suddenly stop being true. So far, you have not done so.
In any case, with minimal effort, I debunked your entire premise that "you cannot have a long-term increasing demand for gold" and in so doing, also refuted the "you should expect gold to have a negative real return on investment" assertion, so my work here is done.

It's not necessarily one individual, no one ever made that claim. The bearwhale is very conceivably multiple individuals acting in tandem. The theory (now proven true) was that they have been acting to deliberately drop the price. They have succeeded spectacularly in doing so.


I can think of 3 or 4 ways to make money that way, without much effort. But hey, if you can't, that must mean it's impossible, right? There's no way it could indicate that you're just not that bright, that's [inconceivable](

So, please, answer the question I asked, not something else:
**How does that affect anyone in the ecosystem differently, at all?**
If the "total purchasing power of all bitcoins that will ever exist decreases" by X instead of Y, how does that affect **anyone** in the ecosystem, at all?

No. So much no.
If you can't stomach loss-of-value, you will not enjoy Bitcoin. It is by no means a sure bet, and day-trading is the worst idea you have ever had.
But if you have $100 to spare and you really wouldn't lose any sleep if that dropped down to $5, sure, invest it into Bitcoin. Just don't try to time the markets. Don't think you know when to buy and sell. Just hold it and wait. If you want to spend a little of it, sure, do so. But holding and waiting (and waiting for *longer than a few weeks/months*) is really the only safe way to "invest" in it. You have to be patient. You cannot spook.

You may notice I never said "I don't understand your comment" - what I actually said was "Nothing you said was relevant to my comment."
Then you tried to mock me, with the suggestion to: "please read it again. I know it's speaking at a high level. wasn't trying to confuse you."
At this point, I decided to demonstrate, using **definitions**, that not only was your parent comment not relevant to the discussion, but **fundamentally made no sense**, which in turn makes you a moron for trying to be condescending while not even knowing the definitions of the words you're using.
And finally, to top it off, instead of doing the smart thing (not responding) you have tried to outline a fictional version of the above exchange, not realizing that we have documented textual evidence of exactly what happened, thwarting this misguided effort of yours. 
So, basically, **I have proven that merchant adoption does not and can not cause downward selling pressure, you have stumbled into the conversation throwing words like "liquidity" around without having the slightest clue of what those words mean, I pointed out that your contribution made no sense, you tried to spin it like I was too dumb to understand, I went on to prove that you're a moron.

Oh, I see. You don't *actually* have a definition of "MLM" you're using, you just shift the definition to fit the context, so that Bitcoin falls under the operating definition you're using. A moment ago MLM needed to have an asset that isn't "tangible" and now MLM just requires people to market it for self-gain. Consistency be damned, you have an idiot's vendetta to fulfill.
Each point on your list is *not* the definition of an MLM. Sorry to break it to you. I'll even go through the motions, just to rub in how embarrassed you should be.


Same can be said for literally any successful stock/IPO ever. 


Not true. Those who believe in Bitcoin invest in it and also evangelize it, sure, but that doesn't mean they benefit any more than anyone else who participates. Satoshi is the least vocal Bitcoin supporter in the world, and is by far the greatest beneficiary of Bitcoin. 


Not necessarily, no. Bitcoin functions as a transaction network whether or not more people continue adopting it. Supply is algorithmically defined, so *if* adoption does continue and demand rises accordingly, the price should rise as a result: this is the value proposition. It's not a "product", as you've *so astutely* observed. It's just a logical proposition.

@_date: 2014-09-14 14:08:36
The problem here is the implicit assumption that mining Bitcoin is a trivial undertaking with any semblance of transparency as to how profitable or successful it would be.
If it was as simple as "Go to Amazon, order Bitcoin miner that mines X bitcoin over Y timeframe for Z price, have it shipped the next day, begin mining, difficulty adjusts as expected" then the price of mining a bitcoin would sure enough wind up reaching an equilibrium of slightly-less-than-1-BTC. 
That is so far from reality, though, that it's fantasy.
If you're ordering a Bitcoin miner, you're probably dealing with some shady BFL-esque company that has a business model which roughly translates to "scam the customers, make a buck". You won't be getting the miner shipped promptly, and difficulty is less predictable than you'd like to think. In the end, however, if someone has bought the miner, the expenditure is a sunk cost. Most ASICs aren't cheap, so even if it's rocketing up your electricity bill, someone who has shelled out their money for a miner is probably going to run that sucker to get a few bits while they can, despite the unprofitability. Basically hoping that Bitcoin increases in value, which would hopefully recoup their expenditures somewhat.
And in the above scenario, guess what the miner is *not* doing? Selling their mined Bitcoin.
In short, the whole thing is one big complicated, complex, convoluted mess of incentives and expectations and economics. It's not as straightforward as "mining 1 bitcoin costs a little less than 1 bitcoin, so $x million must flow into Bitcoin per day in order to offset the miners dumping their mined coins on the markets" - however tempting of a conclusion that is to reach, it's superbly naive and ignores so many factors that it can be readily dismissed.

@_date: 2014-07-30 16:21:26
Haha, you are so very confused.
Log scale maintains proportions. Therefore the move from $1 to $10 (a 900% increase) looks the exact same as a move from $100 to $1000 (also a 900% increase). If you plotted the growth linearly, the move from $1 to $10 looks the exact same as the move from $100 to $110 even though the former is a 900% increase and the latter is a 10% increase.

Am I correct in my assessment that this is implying that Coinbase does not store users' unencrypted passwords in any way (just the encrypted versions of them)? In other words, Coinbase is completely incapable of signing with the SHARED KEY without having the password provided by you, because they flat-out do not have access to it?
If so, when the user resets their account password, is a new SHARED KEY generated?

There is no way to easily discern whether bitbubbly and b0tbubbly are the same person. More likely, one username will be "bitbubbly" and the other will be something like "gomboloid" - two entirely unlinkable usernames.

This has been the big crux of conversations for quite a while now. The existence of the "malicious" actors who are suppressing the price has been essentially proven beyond a reasonable doubt at this point. What is still very much in question is why they are doing it.
One tempting theory is "They're shorting Bitcoin simultaneously" but  has not shown a huge number of BTC shorts while this has been happening. 
My new pet theory is that [Huobi's new fixed-interest scheme]( is an elaborate shorting maneuver which has been basically-disguised. The only way that scheme is sustainable in the slightest is if the price of Bitcoin falls, so whoever has orchestrated that could very well be the bearwhale responsible for the drops we've been seeing, and they're profiting through the Hashing Power Mortgage thing/scam gaining investor interest.
Another possibility is some rich people just want to kill Bitcoin, whatever the cost.

I'm not ignoring the magnitude of the loss at all. You're just trying to salvage a moronic comment. 
If you buy 1 BTC @ $40 you have invested $40 into BTC. That is the same as buying 0.1 BTC @ 400 (investing $40 into BTC), *not* the same as buying 1 BTC at $400 (investing $400 into BTC). 
The increase of magnitude of loss in your example is only because you're pathetically trying to obscure the fact that in the latter scenario, you're investing **ten times as much money into Bitcoin**. It's not the $100 drop that makes you lose more money, it's the fact that you invested 10x more into the system before it dropped.
A drop from $40 to $30 is the same percentage change in value as a drop from $400 to $300. Period. 
I would advise you to not attempt any more argumentation on this front. You have lost.

No, this is patently untrue. Gox did not lead shit. Every single rally (every single night) was sparked and led by BTCChina. It wasn't them "spiking a little higher" - it was them initiating the actual buys. Every time.


No, you're right, you can't, because I'm right.

Everything we know about Satoshi indicates he believes in Bitcoin's long-term success, rarely if ever made mistakes, plotted things meticulously and carefully, understood how to secure his coins properly, behaved and reasoned with the utmost rationality, and wants his brainchild to thrive.
All of the above would indicate that he is still in control of the private keys which provide access to his stash. Toss in the fact that keeping money makes more sense than destroying it, no matter who you are, for good measure.
Also, what good would it do to destroy the private keys? Especially privately?
It looks like I have a lot of reasons why he **didn't** destroy the private keys. You have yet to furnish a single point in favor of the opposing argument. I'll be waiting to see what your non-professional psychoanalysis of Satoshi amounts to, but I'm not holding my breath on this one.

I've never used a DarkNet Market and never intend to. I have no ulterior motives, I just remember scoffing when SR2.0 claimed "transaction malleability" cleaned them out and then, when they were questioned on *how*, they never deigned to respond. It just reeked of "scam" to me.
Tons of people using the site without issues would make the most sense. Plenty of legitimate vendors on there.

That's not even *close* to what you said at first. It may have seemed obvious what you were trying to convey to you, but all you said was "That's called unemployment, I believe" - I, for one, had no idea you were talking about bankers losing jobs.
In any case, retaining obsolete jobs for employment's sake alone is silly. Just because a certain sector is disrupted by progress doesn't mean there's any rational reason to worry about preserving the jobs of those who work(ed) in that sector. It's not like places like Coinbase/Bitpay/Circle won't be hiring if Bitcoin starts to gain traction, either.

Blockchain technology does not magically confer "cheap transfer of wealth"... this demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding (on your part as well as the Central Bank of the Philippines) of *why* the "cheap transfer of wealth" is possible in Bitcoin.
I will try to help you here, in case you're interested in learning:
**The reason why Bitcoin enables a cheap transfer of wealth is because the process of inflation (mining) is subsidizing the agents who perform the transaction verification functionality of the network.**
Those who expend the effort to enable the cheap transfers are being rewarded by the inflation scheme of Bitcoin. They are directly competing over the spoils of inflation and performing the "transfer" processes as a side-effect or byproduct.
If you want to centralize the transaction-processing, the blockchain is **absolutely unnecessary** and actually introduces numerous **inefficiencies**. In other words, it would make things more expensive, not cheaper.
As soon as the decentralized distribution of inflation is scrapped, the blockchain becomes not only unnecessary, but actually expensive to maintain. 
Do yourself a favor and spend some time researching and thinking critically about the system before trying to declare what can and cannot be gleaned from different components of it.

Keep telling yourself that narrative all you want. It doesn't make it true. 
Merchant adoption hasn't hurt the price at all. Among the merchants who have "adopted" Bitcoin, there have been pretty-close-to-0 sales volume through those merchants since the initial announcement and tiny spurt of "let's show our support" on the first day the system was rolled out.
No sales, no dumps. Even companies like Overstock who are *specifically trying to brag about how many bitcoin sales they've achieved* admit that these orders make up less than 0.1% of their sales/revenues. The "merchant adoption is killing the Bitcoin price" is a fool's delusion.

Right now, as it's being adopted, spending it willy-nilly is not the most rational thing to do. Saving it makes more sense, because we're still "Innovaters" and "Early Adopters" in the technological diffusion curve.

Nope, doesn't make sense. How would an application layer make the protocol layer any easier to understand? Do you think that Outlook makes SMTP easier to understand? That doesn't make sense.

It's fun to watch goalposts move like that. First you were talking about "cheap transfer of wealth", which I've already shown that a blockchain doesn't automatically achieve. Now you've suddenly shifted to talking about a "push" payment system. 
Sure, they can build a centralized "push" payment system. It doesn't require a blockchain at all, though. So you think the only thing the Central Bank of the Philippines is after is implementation of "push" payments? That's all they want?
In other words, you're proposing that they roll out National Gift Cards.

But you and I both know you haven't actually read one; certainly not the whole way through and likely not even a substantial portion of it the whole way though.

Quite true, actually. You don't understand what a blockchain is, so you don't get this yet, but that's ok. That's what I'm here for, kid.


Yes, it costs more. You know why? You have to have a network. A network needs bandwidth. That costs money. A blockchain needs processor power. That costs money. Furthermore, a blockchain necessitates redundant disk storage for the data itself. That costs money.
A centralized solution does away with all of these costs. It's fundamentally cheaper.
Again, you don't seem to understand this yet, because you fundamentally do not know what a blockchain is. That's ok. That's what I'm here for, kid.


That's not a blockchain. That's a cryptographic signature. You seem confused what a blockchain is. That's ok, that's what I'm here for.


No, they didn't. You thought they did because you don't know what a blockchain is. That's ok, kid. I'm here.


Nope, it's not. :D


Nope, there aren't. A blockchain is a solution to the Byzantine General's problem on an untrusted network. If you're centralizing matters, the blockchain is going to cost capital to maintain that you would not need to expend. And it's not going to yield any benefits. Whatsoever.

There really isn't a "the goal" in decentralized networks. "The goal" varies depending on the individual participant you're looking at. Person A's "goal" might be to have bitcoin handle their remittance needs while Person B just wants to get some ROI. There's no "right" or "wrong" - it's just a technology, to be used (or not used) as you see fit.


All empirical data suggests users of Bitcoin spend more when the price is rising than when it is falling. It's called [the wealth effect]( and although you probably don't like how it completely contradicts what you learned in your entry-level macroeconomics class, with Bitcoin there is actual hard data that demonstrates that it plays a larger role in consumer expenditure than any deflationary-based urges to "hoard" (i.e. "save").


You keep fixating on the word "currency", very much to your own detriment, unfortunately. Here, do a Find+Replace "money" for the word "currency" and it should help you get out of that debilitating mindset. Consider whether Bitcoin is a good "money" and not whether it is a good "currency" - in other words, does it:
* serve as a medium of exchange?
* serve as a unit of account?
* serve as a store of value?
I'd say "yes" for the first question. The other two are debatable.

Uh, why would microtransactions be the only transactions to use LN? Lower fees and faster confirmations are only useful for tiny transactions and no one will use them for normal-sized transactions because _________...
Can you fill in the blank above? Apparently John Ratcliff cannot. That sure doesn't stop him from plunging forward into Stupidville, though:


Uh, what? Did you just use your own absurdly stupid argument from above as a premise for another argument? Wow. Just, wow.

Any impact Bitcoin has is under the "impact of the Internet" umbrella.
It simply can*not* have more of an impact. Cars can't have more impact than wheels. Literature cannot have more impact than language. Bitcoin cannot have more of an impact than the Internet.

No it's not. "Bitcoin" is the same protocol it's always been (albeit now with MULTISIG). 
Trusted third parties will of course arise in any thriving ecosystem. The point of Bitcoin was never to preclude the existence of such companies, it was to present the possibility of transacting *without* them.
Which is still, of course, entirely possible.

The internet is not a subset of electricity, but Bitcoin is obviously a subset of the Internet. It is a network and protocol.

This argument has **nothing** to do with bitcoins nor deflationary money. That's investment in general you're talking about. Hence the term "risk".


If you have a big pile of deflationary currency, and it's growing in value "far faster than you spend it" then the economy is roaring along beautifully. It's incredibly healthy, and everything is fine and dandy. Why should you be artificially incented to spend or invest, if you're content with your current stash and the economy is doing fine?
Your hypothetical presupposes an incredibly productive economy, and what you're arguing is that a deflationary currency would cause a relatively unproductive economy. You're contradicting yourself in your very assumption.
You're very welcome for identifying the flaw in your reasoning.

Ok, so someone provided a *very big* service for an economy relatively early on... and now they don't even use (spend) the lion's share of their hard-earned stash (thereby slightly increasing the holdings of every other fellow man) and you say this is a *problem*? 
That sounds like an altruist you're describing, not someone we should seek to punish!
The less you spend of your deflationary currency → the lower the velocity of money of that currency → the higher the value of each unit of that currency → the richer everyone else becomes.
What's the issue, exactly, with saving instead of spending? After all, to get any stake that benefits you, you'll have to do *something* to get the currency. The bigger the benefit to the economy you offer, if you're smart about it, the more stake you get. 
You're again very welcome for identifying the flaws in your continued reasoning.
@_date: 2015-02-09 22:15:56
The alternative to what? First off, do you know the source of the data that the Willy report analysis was based off? Look into it. How credible of a source is that?
Go ahead; do the research. I know you can do it. Let me know when you have an answer.
Secondly, let us completely disregard the source of the data, and make a *massive* and *stupid* assumption that it is legitimate data, and is fully verified, and every trade contained therein actually occurred on Mt.Gox. Now how much influence do you attribute to Gox with regards to market movement in the second Bitcoin bubble of 2013? Please show your work; I would like to see your analysis which demonstrates that Chinese exchanges (specifically BTCChina) were not leading most of the movements during that period (both down and up).

That's not true. You're pretending that the value of everyone's holdings (whether they exposed themselves to risk or not) would go up proportionally, when in reality those who took the profitable risks would benefit more than those who sat idly with their funds and waited for others to do so.
If you make a smart Bitcoin investment, you would make bitcoins in return, *and* marginally increase the value of your coins in doing so.
So, in short, your entire point is laughably off-base.

He has thus far not demonstrated *any* comprehension of the actual processes that underlie Bitcoin.

You seem to be missing one of the prime motivations behind creating Bitcoin (if I may be so bold as to interpret Satoshi's work): namely, redistribution of the wealth that is so fiendishly stockpiled by the 1%.
It's not that ridiculous to think that Bitcoin would create more billionaires than ever, because...
A) there is the potential for a lot more billionaires to exist than the quantity that currently does. 
B) Bitcoin is slowly but surely eliminating the friction of financial transactions (which is billions of dollars being *wasted* on a daily basis in the SNAFU we have right now)
C) On the way up, a lot of possessors of Bitcoin will be "cashing out" and will never be able to buy up those cheap coins again. Eventually these potential-billionaires are going to be succumbing to the temptations of **actually spending their money on things** and it should naturally equalize out to where the clever amass wealth and the not-so-clever slowly lose it. It's how things go.
TL;DR: people spend money over time so not everyone is going to achieve "billionaire-status" that they dream of. Money gets wasted these days because the financial industry is a giant bloated mess, and that wasted money could now theoretically start lining the crypto-nerds' pockets if they're indeed onto something. Money is really really concentrated into very few pockets right now, and if you spread it around a bit you might be surprised how much there is to go around.

@_date: 2013-11-13 21:13:33
1. I never claimed Bitcoin would amount to *completely fair redistribution of wealth amongst the entire world population*. I don't expect this to happen. I *do* expect (and hope for) a slight improvement in matters.
2. My point  was more meant to be about the removal of transactional friction. Of course things will continue forward and innovators will innovate, creators will create, value will change hands. That's not really what I was highlighting.
3. This is not equivalent to the "trickle down" idea, because in Bitcoin you are prohibited from "pumping new money into the economy" - in other words, in the only important aspect, the two ideas are basically opposites. In a trickle-down scenario, it's a "Hey, let's just create a whole bunch more money and then give that to the people at the top... eventually this will reach the lower tiers when they inevitably spend the money!" In Bitcoin, it's "Hey, no matter who you are in Bitcoin, your money is increasing in value! If you want to enjoy that value, spend it. Otherwise, save it!"
The key distinction is that you can't just print more Bitcoins later willy-nilly, as they've been doing with USD (and pretty much all currencies) for quite some time. You have to live with the fact that the block reward is what it is.
