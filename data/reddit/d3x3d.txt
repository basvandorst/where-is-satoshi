because they're smarter than men and let them worry about the money so they can focus on more important issues like hair and nails, which the men will pay for

"If". and that is highly improbable. but in that case, i will most definitely stick to my plan and dump immediately before it plummets.

it certainly went beyond my wildest estimations. that dip after the $1K earlier this year was spooky.

having lots of fun reading these threads today. LOL! :)

way cooler and smarter than Jamie Dimon.

it is in the interest of a Bitcoin owner to run a node since it contributes to the overall benefit of their asset, but there is still some altruism and sense of community involved because it is not a necessary measure in order to own Bitcoin. most of the typical users have wallets like Electrum and Bither. they won't bother taking the time and resources to download the core wallet. miners would need to run a node for the extra protection but it's not necessary for the typical user unless they have an interest to take the extra effort.

he updates the article realizing what has happened but states that he would still do it all over again. smh-facepalm

no need to FOMO - just buy while you can and sit on it. crypto is the future of money, i think. now as for BCH, i'm not a big fan of the forking drama, but i could be wrong and it may be the way to go in the future and replace BTC. maybe we'll end up with BTC --&gt; BTCC (bitcoin classic) and BCH --&gt; BTC. with regards to LTC, i think it's great and you should get 10 more. :)

the node is where the transactions and confirmations take place on the blockchain. the blockchain is the peer-to-peer distributed ledger technology that forms the foundation of Bitcoin. running the node will help other existing nodes in the effort of validating transactions and blocks. therefore you contribute to the security of the network by running a node. there are no monetary incentives in running nodes but you will feel good being part of a community project that is changing the world.

he looks pretty easy to beat up. my little brother would kick his ass for free.

i gave up on trying to time the bottom. but my wild guess would be maybe back to $4K by Jan 2018 before it bounces back up and gets back on track towards $10K after this BCH hype wears off. of course i could be wrong - never in my wildest estimation did i think we'd be seeing BCH @ over $2K in the  market cap slot.

“I’ve seen more people fail because of liquor and leverage – leverage being borrowed money. You really don’t need leverage in this world much. If you’re smart, you’re going to make a lot of money without borrowing.” - Warren Buffet (wrong about Bitcoin but he doesn't give a damn because he got the money and can't care less about your fancy computer shit)

and you sound like a very handsome person who has made a significant contribution to humanity with your face. ;)

once i receive mine from Coinbase, i plan on dumping them to buy more BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:10:58
and when everyone is scared and it drops, that's when you buy more.

according to my tea leaves, massive 35-40% correction by December, then $10K by 2nd qtr 2018.
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:44:09
on Bittrex, it's listed as BCC. no BitConnect on there. but it should be BCH.
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:06:47
i gotta say it is a bit troubling. BTC hitting the $8K and shooting for $10K is great but all of this forking drama is not good in the long run.
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:13:41
really that was only a year ago - wow! BTC moving forward so fast it's creating a dilation in the fabric of space-time.
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:20:58
just send me the 1099-B and i'll be more than happy to file it. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:41:58
LOL! there was a point in time around 2 yrs ago when $666 was truly horrific after $750. but now $6,666 wouldn't be so bad after $7,000. ;)

you're going to need to send the baby to college eventually so keep on investing in BTC and other crypto. the revolution has just begun. your boy will be growing up in a new world where he will be buying his school lunch thru the blockchain. congrats and all the blessings to you and your family! :)
