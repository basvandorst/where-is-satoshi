Make sure autocorrect isn't messing up your name. My autocorrect entered my name as "NONHISPANIC LATINO" which is not my name

We all gotta learn at some point. Were you a bitcoin pro at day 1?
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:27:19
I would say fuck the irs. Them taxing bitcoin would be like them taxing my runescape gold

Well your first mistake was assuming prices would be their lowest on Monday or Tuesday. Your second mistake was making a post that didn't make much sense. Just buy with your card now cause it's only going up from here

That's literally the fucking point of bitcoin though ya dumbass. Sure some dickheads see it as an investment opportunity, but many would like to free themselves from fiat currency.

The noobs don't know how to change their transaction fees yet. I just recently learned myself

Hell I bought some pot seeds just last week directly with bitcoin. Tell me it's useless, foh

Where's your serious answer mr internet policeman?
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:07:47

Bro keep it and buy a new bitch

Think he meant to an alt wallet that you yourself own. Also some wallet moves can be done with an email address. Imo you should read more about btc before you put money into it.

Um. Bro, if I buy a car for 2k there ain't no way in fuck I'm paying 5k/yr on insurance. Just like it don't make sense to spend $100 on a wallet that will hold $50. 
Op should buy $150 in btc since he apparently has 150 to spend, and keep it in a wallet like spectrum

They are running these reports because they are salty they weren't smart enough to cash out. Also they are run by the people up top which are likely telling them to say that. Imagine how the Rothschild family feels about bitcoins goal.

I mean, aol was pretty much useless for anything other than checking emails. Now look at the internet, I can watch porn in such high definition I can count the pores on the bitches skin.
You sound stupid my friend

Just tried to move some money and they want over 100k satoshi to move $20. Ok, let me pay $16 so I can trade $20. Why is THIS? Was only $3 the other day to move $60
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:59:36
To some people that could be 6 hours of hard work dickhead
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:51:10
So you're getting salty now that bitcoin is actually becoming a viable currency?
