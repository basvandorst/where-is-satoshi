I'm in China and I recieve BTCs. What do you want?

I'm using Bitcoin-qt and Armory. These two are all client-side software which I deem good and safe. By using Armory, I can realize offline mode / cold storage (which is safe against online hacking) and both paper &amp; digital backups (which is secure and convenient).

I'm a native Chinese in Shanghai. Till now there was only one article ever emerged on any Chinese MSM media in relation with Bitcoin, in 2011 that was. The media is a newspapaer called The Southen Weekend or 南方周末. In matter of fact, it is not exactly a MSM yet, but a quite famous tabloid.

Currently there are altogether ten BTC exchanges trading in CNY (not those very small and dead exchanges named like Gox something CNY), but only the BtcChina is shown on the western lists. I should like to remind you that the other nine exchanges I've mentioned are trading in considerably big volume.
