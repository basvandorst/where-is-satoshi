huge government dorms. gives them a sense of community and shit. giant communal garden in the middle. outdoor theater/projection in one corner, swimming pool in another. make it fucking summer camp 365 days/year for old people. giant room with VR/computers for lan parties/skyping with the grand kids.

Believe it or not, those elderly people were once adults fit for working for at least 30 years. $100/paycheck for 50 years turns into 1 million with a super conservative 3% annual interest.

Very few people are "just fortunate."
There is no duty higher than each individual's duty to themselves.

1. time horizon is too small. Even S&amp;P 500 is not green for all possible 5 year combinations in its history
2. Nothing is risk free, but with a sufficiently large time horizon (in this situation 50 years) and properly diversified portfolio you will be in the green
3. While all investments carry risk, paying into social security is a guaranteed loss, probably even more many people that take out more than they put in, because if the money they put in was invested over the years it would be more than their eventual SS payout
Risk free is for chumps. If something is risk free it's because they are profiting so much off of your money that they can actually guarantee you that money, in which case you are technically losing money.

with your mentality, you really do need social security

How come my fees in electrum are so high then? I think i recently paid like $10 on a transfer of 0.117 btc

says the guy who thinks 5 year bonds are risky, fuck off boomer

It's not my fellow man keeping a roof over my head or food on my table. No problem, the higher up the ladder the larger piece of the pie you get. Social security is chump change at the end of the day.

that kind of revolution has no chance to work in the USA today. Forgetting the local PDs with military surplus equipment, majority of private gun owners are not the types calling for socialism.

I'm also using electrum and get high fees

Not sure why getting old automatically elevates a person to a higher status. Were they not adults with responsibilities for 50 years? Why the fuck should society subsidize people who couldn't be assed to put away $100 per paycheck?
For reference, $100/pay check, 26 paychecks/year, 50 years, assuming 3% compound interest per year is $987,438.
They should just make huge government dormitories with community kitchens.

I used 0.25% interest per paycheck but that's admittedly a flawed approach. 3% annual  and $100/pay check is super conservative anyways.
$200/paycheck, $5200/year, 5% **annual** compound interest = $1,090,903.06

Yeah a poor person who couldn't be assed to develop themselves to make more than minimum wage is going to sieze the means of production

It would absolutely cost less

holy shit we actually got to the 140 bitcoin block you mentioned at 11,700....we might actually blow through this in another hour
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:39:23
why would the futures cause a sharp correction?
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:01:01
should i put a sell limit on at 11,800 or so? need to sleep but no idea where this is going...
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:41:11
what's the difference between that and me just buying a bitcoin outright? This way if it's less than $10k in 6 months I can hold until the price potentially goes up
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:31:06
i sold my ETH at $478 to buy BTC at $11,660. trying to get a feel for where the peak is but honestly no fucking clue... 99% of my other coin I got in at $11,100. I think I will jsut sell if it hits $11,700 again

He needs to live in Hong Kong to know what's going on? Everyone in Hong Kong knows by virtue of living in Hong Kong?

He's not making any claims about bitcoin though. He's just talking about HK. He's a financial professional that has covered China/HK in his past interviews and likely his professional work. He doesn't need to live in hk to have an informed perspective on the HK, and this is coming from a native HKer.
In this past interview he conducted, the interviewee predicts that the HKD will be eliminated because it is pegged to USD and can't be controlled like RMB. His comment in this context is certainly relevant.

The spirit of your commentary was correct, just directed at the wrong person I think. Peace ��

No not at 13.8k. When we were around 12.6k i saw resistance at 13.3k and 13.8k and wasn't sure which I wanted sell orders at. Ended up doing it at 13.3k.
Bought some back at 11.75k and the rest at 12-12.15k
@_date: 2019-06-27 03:59:53
Of course not, there's some experience and some luck involved

I successfully traded the dip and ended with an extra  0.4 btc

3-4k/Satoshi, I'm in
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:52:54


Your assumptions state 0.17 BTC on average for each wallet at 1 btc = $1m valuation, which implies an average wallet value of $170k.
Then you go ahead and use an average $1m wallet value anyways.
You can't even keep your variables straight so I see no reason giving the rest of your post any attention.

Looks like handle for cup and handle is forming? I'm honestly kind of retarded when it comes to TA but it would be neat if sometimes it do be like that
