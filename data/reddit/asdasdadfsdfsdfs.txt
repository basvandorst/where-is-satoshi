That was the worst debate I've ever seen. And I own gold and bitcoin.

I loved the chart saying up 25,000%, lol

There is another $1m bid on bitstamp which has been being placed and withdrawn all day.

Listen to yourself, the hypocrisy is astounding.

Wire transfers even including currency exchange are not this expensive, it is almost a 10% difference.

Oh no, that sucks.

Legal mafia

Fantastic news that Chinese regulators have essentially legitimized the exchanges.

I'm assuming most arbitrageurs will hold money on both exchanges in order to work around this - so possible fiat is running out on Bitstamp &amp; not being replaced fast enough from cash transferred back from BTCC?

We need to move the decimal point.

I think there is a larger probability than not that the price will increase over the next 3-6 months and I am invested in that outcome to the extent to which I am comfortable given the uncertainty you mention.

Get over yourself. There are a lot of Trump supporters who are awake to the manipulation of the central banks and searching for a way to fight back, there is a huge cross over with the bitcoin community already. I have been involved in bitcoin for years, and fully supported Trump's run.

They are no longer seeking refuge, they have already found refuge from the conflict, they are migrating in order to improve their circumstances - perfectly understandable, but not necessarily in the interests of the German people.

Except for the fact that the vast majority of migrants arriving into Europe are not from Syria. Also worth noting that they are passing through multiple safe countries, and therefore even the migrants from Syria are not refugees by the time they reach Germany.

How is that in any way a valid comparison to what she said?
@_date: 2017-05-01 21:03:50
How is it racist when she's not discussing a race? Also how are you such an expert on the issue? 
@_date: 2017-05-01 21:59:18
You're an idiot.
