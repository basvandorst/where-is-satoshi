Next time say you want to do a talk about blockchain technology. They'll be all over it.   ;-)

Yeah, that's not my birth date though. I existed before I created this reddit account!

This is a serious question... how could all the coins "go away"?
I suppose if every computer with a bitcoin client was destroyed that would be the case, but as long as me and one other person are running it they haven't gone away.

From the day I first actually figured out what Bitcoin is and how it functions, it seemed self-evident that all of my Mexican friends who send money back home will not be handing over $100+ of their hard-earned money to Western Union every month for much longer.

Most upvoted post is a rant about a "raging feminist SJW". Boy, I wonder why people don't take bitcoin seriously after reading this sub.

You honestly can't think of a reason that it makes sense for casinos to be regulated?
There's a difference between tyrannical government and reasonable regulation that makes sense for everyone involved. The "Reason" generation of libertarians are so quick to cry about non-issues that it tarnishes anyone who advocates for free markets or limited government.
For the slow kids, yes, we do want laws that make sure poker sites aren't stealing from us.

You don't really understand anarchism then. It does not mean the elimination of social welfare.
