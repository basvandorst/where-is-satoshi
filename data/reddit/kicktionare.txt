The 3k-5k is suppose to be visited.
Now it might never come... But that is the alternative to the moon.
Since the cost of producing a BTC is around that amount then based on FOMO
3k;5k then halving takes it to 10k since the cost is around 5k so 5k * 2 = 10k
Now we know FOMO increases value up to 40 to 50%... Bringing temporary value to 17k- 18k
Settling at 14k... Before moving up to 30k.
