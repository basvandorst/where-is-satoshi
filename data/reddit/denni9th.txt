Feels good to live in a third world country where taxes on bitcoin doesn't apply yet.
Yes as a citizen I should pay tax, but it'll just end up in a politicians back pocket, so I'm in no rush to start.

All my lecturers use this theme, it's reminding me of the test I should be studying for

This happened to me. Spent $500 on an cloud mining contact halfway through 2016. Bought my first car at the end of 2017 for $4500. A second hand Mercedes C Class. The cloud mining contract has basically dried up now, I don't mine enough to cover the "maintenance fees", but I'm happy with what I got out of it. I'm hodling the bitcoin I have left.

Still, I can get a bank account for r20 ($1.50) per month and have unlimited free card swipes, so that's like 20 bitcoin transactions. I could easily do 20 transactions in a week, since I don't carry cash. So as a daily use account, the bank still is better. 
To forget the bank while still keeping things reasonable, I'd need to use a credit card and then pay it off with bitcoin. But for big transactions, I'd use bitcoin straight.

So if I have bitcoin now, and assuming a split happens and I need to sweep both chains, do I then double my money in the sense that I'll have my bitcoins on both chains?
