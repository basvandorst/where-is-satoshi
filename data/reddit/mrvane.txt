Arnem is the so-called "bitcoin town" in the netherlands. Several businesses, a bitcoin bank and periodical meetings are there. I see it as a virtual gold miners town :)

Wow i really love this! I first saw bitcoin in and thought of it as a payment method, but this is way more!

I'd love to test it! My pros are that im young and i will easily be able to review if it handles easily. You might not know ir, but lots of young and old people are interested (younger than 16, older than 60)
EDIT: I can test on android (multiple devices) and windows for you

I want a service that allows me to pay with crypto's for EVERYTHING.
Well, many merchants accept paypal, maybe all of them. We need a service that automatically converts to doge. 
Here is my idea.
It's divided into parts.
1. The guy that wants to buy stuff with crypto
2. The converter who converts crypto to paypal and buys the product. (All in the code)
3. The people who want the crypto's used to buy the product.
It's easy. John wants to buy a book with doge. John has a link to the product, and his account on the converter already has his details (adress, email, etc.) John already has his crypto on the converter site, as a balance. John adds an order, link to the product, etc. Crypto will leave his account and go to the marketplace. This is were part 3 starts.
Part 3 is about people who want the doge which John used to buy his book. John's doge is already transferred to marketplace, and people will be able to buy it for a fair price, because the converter is a non-profit and exists trough donations and/or monthly deductions from account balance. 
1. John buys book with crypto = happy
2. Converter is code and does what he can. Earns money trough donations and/or monthly fees. Owner = happy
3. People get to buy crypto, without any fees = happy
My life isn't complete untill this exists.

Thus, this sub exists to allow bitcoiners to join this poll without telling them what to do.
@_date: 2015-07-31 13:51:18
Yes, i wondered if bitcoin owners would update or not

Bitcoin makes it able to easily recieve payments for freelance jobs. My brother does not agree.
@_date: 2015-03-01 20:31:17
No, if he makes 45$, and he wins, i have to pay him another 4.5$. Not much, but it's a fun bet :D
@_date: 2015-03-01 19:54:39
Seems legit.
