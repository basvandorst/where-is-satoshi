It was linden dollars not Bitcoin. People wanted her to do a performance on secondlife.
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:10:14
The fees tho
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:26:46
If you can use gdax you dodge the crazy coinbase fees.
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:45:34
It's trolling like this that makes everyone ignore negativity like OP says.
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:46:04
So many happy people will wake up to limit buy orders triggered.

Maybe Hillary diehards who didn't give a shit about 2008, but I'd be surprised to find any Bernie voters who oppose crypto currency.
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:49:42
In the past I tried timing it and gdax crashed before I could rebuy lower. Ended up having to buy back in after things had already rebounded. With an unreliable platform like that you shouldn't bother.
@_date: 2018-01-02 08:43:44
Yep an API exists
@_date: 2018-01-28 11:15:12
I think many privileged people don't see the advantages of crypto, because they already experience some of those advantages through other means. It's only when shit hits the fan that decentralization matters to some people. Many are still happy to use PayPal until their funds get locked.

In before it's OP's dad's dick pics from a sony camera.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:30:19
Explains why we were seeing continuous repetitive tiny sells at the same small increments the past few days on gdax, regardless of price movements.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:55:16
is leaking
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:17:04
I'm one of the lucky people who got to sell BCH on gdax before it crashed.

Software development takes more time than it takes to engage in marketing and manipulation.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:37:24
Entire exchanges have come and gone along with major scandals that caused long term fear. This pissed a lot of people off and likely scammed many, but it barely registers in the grand scheme.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:00:52
If there's a 4k sell wall it's a strong indication that nobody will ever buy it at that price any time soon.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:49:17
Can always tip in dogecoin
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:39:05
Yes check recent crypto 101 podcast, it was mentioned

Did you own the bitcoin prior to the fork?
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:22:48
Quick now you can trade him back for bitcoin at a large profit
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:41:38
Obviously have to keep in mind who the advertisers are on the network. Gold sellers and financial institutions.

If we can raise enough for real estate hodlings then a tax exemption might be in the cards. The real question is how do you decentralize a religion? Scripture via blockchain?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:31:25
You can sell for usd or trade directly
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:19:56
First thing would be to transfer it to gdax to avoid excess fees. This is a pretty significant drop from the ATH, likely one of the best times to buy for quite a while.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:33:44
Keep in mind the ltc is still doing well, just not as crazy as earlier in the day.
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:23:10
Any exchange's users will benefit from regulation of the exchange. If you don't like it then don't use an exchange.

Asking reddit is fine, it's just not smart to trust any one person.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:17:13
lol I'd be more worried if it went under 10k, this is peanuts
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:01:42
Buy some now, some later
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:39:29
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:59:50
If you stagger your buys then you can keep buying as it drops.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:27:44
I suggest doing your research, because the inaccurate headline you posted in here is doing you no favors in understanding what to do. In short, that was clickbait with many falsehoods.
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:52:31
All time high. Right now is a great price
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:19:27
I think that's not a very accurate way of stating it. The problem lies in people reading/hearing about bitcoin and its properties, wanting it, then being misled into buying something else.
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:45:24
You can buy Bitcoin in an IRA.
@_date: 2017-12-26 02:45:48
He thinks it's a joke, actually. Read his other Bitcoin tweets.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:54:59
Wonder how all the people who bought at the "highs" feel seeing the price they paid not even show up on the graph.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:58:32
Probably right after they sell theirs.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:55:21
There's a reason nobody else would use that price. Anyone who managed to sell above 3k should feel lucky.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:41:03
If your money is on coinbase already it's very easy and fast to move it to gdax. If you want to move some elsewhere to buy trash alts then you can, but for btc/eth/ltc you can use gdax.
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:54:58
It has strictly limited supply that can't increase. It is not bound by any single government or organization. It has the potential to have low fee and fast speed transactions worldwide. It gives full confidence and control to individuals.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:41:16
I'd likely sell if I were you, because the massive influx of supply that just happened should drive the price down. I'd expect under $2k soon.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:38:28
Yes, there are 2k bch that people want to sell at the current price and nobody is buying them.
edit: sell wall hit 3k bch
@_date: 2017-12-29 07:30:26
Only if they make it like CatMario. Now that I think of it I could probably program it if people came up with more ideas.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:36:55
That's why there's a 2k sell wall at the current price, nobody wants to buy at such an inflated price relative to everyone else.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:07:44
This is definitely true. The main issue is the perpetration of fraud involved with bcash, which has a lot of people on this subreddit upset.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:29:06
Can't wait to sell bcash at the ATH and buy Bitcoin at the current low.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:21:14
It's still down 13% today
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:39:47
Well, those are like he says a store of value, not an investment vehicle. His one good point is that gold has a proven record of holding value through a crisis, while bitcoin has yet to weather a wide-scale financial disaster. All that means is that it's risky as a store of wealth, in particular if confidence diminishes during hard times.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:49:32
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:37:01
It's still up, but you can't sell your bcash yet.
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:45:09
Of all the things millennials were blamed with killing I never thought I'd see USD.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:21:26
It's a meme
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:26:17
Buy now. Futures could influence a new ATH too.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:03:39
Bitcoin has the brightest future and for any short term benefits you can swap some to litecoin or use a segwit enabled wallet to keep fees/tx time low.
Most importantly, do your research and make an objective decision based on what you want.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:45:24
It was not a slight at Etherium.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:54:42
Nothing wrong with diversifying. If Bitcoin stumbles it's reasonable to expect an alt like litecoin to see solid growth.
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:32:31
They weren't earlier in the day afaik, but that may have been a bug.
@_date: 2018-08-05 04:37:55
I think both are reasonable. I don't really care if bitcoin is worth a lot of USD. I just want other people to use it commonly and get rid of Paypal.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:10:32
Careful, if you place a market order at $0 you'll end up confirmed for $6000 and selling will be disabled.
