I believe in the tech so I'm "donating my money".... I quietly whisper through my tears in the dead of night
@_date: 2018-06-15 01:41:58
I would say it's a mix of both.  We're all in it because we want money and it's natural to make pity jokes to make everyone feel better since we're all in it together, even though we all know we're gonna be okay in the long run.  I think everyone is taking this a little too seriously lol. Let's all bitch about it now to have fun, then lambos + awesome future Internet! WOOOOOO!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2018-06-10 22:44:15
The first Internet wasn't the best Internet.  It was just "the first Internet".  Bitcoin may or may not last, but this market is here to stay.  Too much potential and money invested (small and big players alike) to not be inevitable.  Just keep your eyes open for which coins are moving!  
@_date: 2018-06-14 06:05:01
I know it doesn't but that's the point, this changes that.  
Otherwise, if bitcoin isn't anonymous then what is it?  It's the whole point. 
@_date: 2018-06-17 22:59:15
Oh god dude lol I really hope it turns around for you.  HODL
@_date: 2018-06-14 23:25:48
That's true it is "another form of voting", but in my opinion that is downplaying the significance of it.  Sure, leaders at the top will have to make the big decisions because the "common man" doesn't have time to sift through foreign policy and all of the minutia of politics.  But think of all we have heard in the last 1-2 years, especially regarding "voter fraud" and "the polls are all lies" and "who really got the popular vote" etc,etc,etc.  This would help to quash that, and restore confidence in our democracy that it is functioning as it should be (in terms of election process at least)
@_date: 2018-06-14 23:27:55
Regarding your last sentence, those two go hand in hand.  
@_date: 2018-06-14 23:17:29
I didn't say it was simple, and you didn't say it was impossible.  But yes I'm dreaming
@_date: 2018-06-18 03:07:39
Oh damn yeah
@_date: 2018-06-13 02:14:57
Apparently so, enlighten me Moses
@_date: 2018-06-14 06:03:11
I agree the problems are intertwined, along with all other personal data management (SSN, credit scores, bank information, healthcare information, etc etc etc) .  But just like we all have SSNs, the innovation of blockchain could allow us to have a singular public address too, for record keeping.  I think some additional privacy innovations would need to be secured before it goes to that level but you know, the first internet wasn't the best internet.  
@_date: 2018-06-04 06:55:01
Sadly you're right...
@_date: 2018-06-14 09:26:42
Regardless of the exact system, every developed country has methods of keeping track of and identifying their citizens and non-citizens.  You are picking apart the unimportant parts of what I'm saying.  This is exactly for the people in the undeveloped nations because it makes corruption that much more difficult (skewed voter tallies in dictatorships, etc)
@_date: 2018-06-16 09:00:54
Y no lambo 
@_date: 2018-06-05 06:25:08
Kinda agree.  I can't until Tim Cook leaves and there's a change in leadership, hopefully for the better.  Everyone likes the good things about Apple, but they just need to quit frustrating everyone by making proprietary adapters, removing headphone jacks, require this or that to be different, etc.  If they want it to be SIMPLE, they don't always make it simple. 
@_date: 2018-06-17 06:23:48
You're welcome ;) 
@_date: 2018-06-17 22:59:54
Or possibly a full on trout leap. Haven't seen one of those since Obama though 
@_date: 2018-06-30 13:33:49
Lmao excellent point 
@_date: 2018-06-11 22:42:25
That's what I'm sensing too.  Seems like the major coins are recovering again so that's encouraging 
@_date: 2018-06-18 03:07:51
Lmao 
@_date: 2018-06-17 20:52:58
@_date: 2018-06-14 09:23:38
Verifiable voting. Meaning the entire country could verifiably vote on issues like "should we go to war" or "who should be president".  In terms of voting elections, it would remove the ability to corrupt and manipulate vote tallies.  This would return democracy to countries currently in sham democracies where one leader gets 98% of the vote every year (yeah right, nobody agrees that often), as well as outright dictatorships.  In addition, it would help the US too (election count disputes that occur every year)
@_date: 2018-06-14 23:19:05
The accounts are.  Again, that's the whole point.  Bitcoin is almost impossible to trace "digital cash", which is why it gained the reputation for being used on the dark web
@_date: 2018-06-16 09:02:08
Damn I love the comic lol 
@_date: 2018-06-11 03:13:29
Whooops  I didn't know I was lol.  How do I turn it off?  I'm new to Reddit (notice I have 17 karma) 
@_date: 2018-06-17 22:21:01
This took an annoyingly long time to make btw lol 
@_date: 2018-06-13 22:28:17
So... the more rare a Pokemon is, the more Pokepennies we get?  Save up 1000 Pokepennies and you can exchange that in for one standard Mudkip.  A Mew is worth 10 Mudkipz.  Do the math
@_date: 2018-06-15 20:11:47
I agree with that, but I think that because technology has never been able to offer this possibility ever before in history, some decisions currently held by legislators should be given back to the public.  Especially regarding civil rights.  Think if the whole country could vote on issues like LGBTQ issues, racial issues, immigration issues, marijuana legalization, etc.  The issues that define the way we live, not the way the country is run.  It would be an incredible shift of power back to the people.
@_date: 2018-06-14 23:29:46
Yeah I'm not saying we are there just yet, and still need to look more into the follymyvote thing that I found, but I do believe with development this would be possible 
@_date: 2018-06-11 22:03:03
Is "blood Sunday" over?  What do you guys think?

If Bitcoin and the rest of the cryptocurrency rally is on the rails of another few weeks of the bears because the recent rally didn't have enough volume behind, then why doesn't everyone on Reddit just agree to start trading?... Am I missing something? Will that not work/is it illegal?
Not a pump and dumper!  Just trying to understand market psychology, as well as what is and is not allowed (or considered ethical) in cryptocurrency trading.  I am new to all of this and am only trying to learn.  Any advice/input is greatly appreciated :)   
@_date: 2018-06-14 05:58:16
@_date: 2018-06-18 19:36:46
Haha that is actually pretty crazy though.  Has/can someone plot this with BTC price as well?  
\*nose goes\* 
@_date: 2018-06-10 22:50:26
LOL I wish :"(  crazy price drops in last 24 hours
@_date: 2018-06-14 23:20:20
Check out the edit, at least one other person had this idea as well and they're working on it and calling it followmyvote.  I'm going to look more into it but it sounds like exactly what I was thinking 
@_date: 2018-06-04 06:54:34
That's a very very good point haha.  BCC prime example 
@_date: 2018-06-12 19:50:09
Why would you want your fellow Reddit users to lose all of their money?..
@_date: 2018-06-17 17:40:29
@_date: 2018-06-17 06:23:37
That's right ;) release the bulls
@_date: 2018-06-11 03:28:06
Is that a suicide joke?.. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 09:29:03
Your comment alone made the hassle of making it worth it haha 
@_date: 2018-06-04 06:57:46
lmao Skycoin actually sounds like a terrible teenage sci-fi future currency
@_date: 2018-06-17 21:54:19
Hahahaha oh god. 
@_date: 2018-06-16 09:03:12
Smh.  Just goes to show how much misplaced faith there is in the current financial system only because trying something "new" is scary
@_date: 2018-06-14 23:21:50
But also yes agreed, but what I'm saying is there are so many governments which present themselves as democracies but in reality they are essentially dictatorships, where the elections are shams.  This technology could potentially make that impossible to do in those areas
@_date: 2018-06-12 19:49:27
Very true... all I can tell myself is, everyone does say "only put in what you can afford to lose" and "it's a risky, highly volatile market", and yet in reality everyone thinks we're gonna be buying lambos in 2 months so when it doesn't happen, even if it's just relatively "normal" market behavior, everyone freaks out and is disappointed.  
@_date: 2018-06-04 06:57:10
Yeah that's what I've been assuming but was wondering if there was any deeper reasoning behind it
@_date: 2018-06-17 19:20:46
@_date: 2018-07-05 18:44:27
Actually the article was more likely written by "an expert" who "did his research on Bloomberg and Business Insider".  Twitter and Reddit would've told a different story
@_date: 2018-07-04 08:58:21
Haha just acknowledging how crypto is addictive initially 
@_date: 2018-07-17 23:20:23
This will help:
"**Today saw the appointment of** [**David Solomon as the new chief executive of US investment bank Goldman Sachs**]( who's currently the firm's current chief operating officer.** **Last month Soloman said Goldman is looking in to adding further bitcoin and cryptocurrency services.**
He will take over from current Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein in October.
Many bitcoin faithful are hoping that as the mainstream financial services industry bets on bitcoin, the price will rise back to levels last seen in December last year — and possibly higher."
@_date: 2018-07-01 05:26:38
I’ll print it out to make you happy.
