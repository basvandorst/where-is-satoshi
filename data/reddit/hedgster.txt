Was when I originally did my calculations.. it might be around that point still with what is mined by my other units.. wife has keep me up to date lately on what’s been mined .. I have an l3+ and our desktops are mining zcash at night.

I have 3 and they are still very profitable, at least in canada.  
They make approximately 100/day .. energy consumption isn’t terrible and the extra heat means my furnace never turns on so my natural gas bill is next to nothing.
Once bitcoin bounces we’ll be making more daily as well.

Same.  People said don't buy S9's unless you get first batch it's not profitable.  It's super profitable still.  I don't heat my house so I save on my natural gas bill and I still make $100+ daily.  I also have a D3+ which doesn't net nearly as much and a couple 1080Ti and 1070GTX mining Zcash.

I couldn’t agree more, they profit from something they are invested in and are most knowledgeable about.. new tech scares them and doesn’t allow them to have a strangle hold on it.  
Happy Hodl’ing and a merry mining holidays!

I think the recent surge has been due to media coverage.  Coinbase kind of fucked up a lot of trust in the casual investor.  I'm sure there has been more than a few people liquidating because of their fuck up.  
That being said, when I originally invested they forecasted bitcoin to reach 10k by end of 2018... 3 weeks later it's at 10k.. then the newer forecast was 40k by end of 2018... I think it's just time to hodl and buy as it drops, there have been crashes before and it surges back once confidence rises again.

Urges caution to ensure Wall Street Nd hedge funds get their dirty mitts on as much as they can as it begins to soar again

I can relate.  I definitely don't need to heat my house at the moment, I open a window and it helps a little with the heat.. it's like a frikkin sauna bud!

Everything is mined in a pool.  Unless you have a large mining farm the likelihood of you mining and being profitable yourself is pretty slim.  Unless of course you’re mining altcoins and maybe you can mine it for yourself, but even then I mine in a pool for alt coins.

As long as it’s running you make money.. the way I see the GPU’s running was that I was going to leave my computer running all night anyways and I wanted to build a beastly machine to begin with.
So meh.. make some return on my investment at least when I’m not on it.
As for the ASIC miners I bought them with profits made in the fall so their cost wasn’t that bad to begin with.  So right now they earn profit for being on. The overall cost/power usage isn’t as lucrative.  That being said, the value of bitcoin goes up and so do all the alt coins... so mine now for the long term returns.  I want to HODL as much as I can, and only cash out if required.  (Which might be the case in the fall/winter because I’m getting work done on my house)

March 2019 they will complain it's down 60% ... when it's sitting at 25k

I have 3x S9 a L3+, a desktop with 2x 1070 gtx and a desktop with 2x 1080 Ti.
For the ASIC miners I check periodically through the AntPool app.  Just checking hash rates suffices.
My desktop with 2x 1070 gtx is a back up for my wife.. so it mines 24/7.  My desktop with 2x 1080 Ti cards I fire up when not in use.. just set a profile to run at 75% gpu power and high fan speed to keep temps down.
If you’re looking at an ASIC miner ensure you have the proper power run to keep the speeds where they should be... 220v outlets with a large breaker as they can draw upwards of 10A on startup.
I have a setup that allows 3 units per breaker with a double wide box offering 4 outlets per box.
You can run it off 110V but I believe the speeds are ramped down on the units.
Other than that if you intend to mine with your PC just watch GPU temps and ensure you have good airflow in the case and in the room where you intend to be running the unit.
I haven’t had to turn on my furnace all winter (in Canada) and have actually had to vent heat for the better part of the day. Our ground floor feels like it has radiant heating (some of the heat vents above the drop ceiling)

I'm thinking more so of investing in the hardware and mining whatever is profitable.  There are a multitude of crypto currency available to mine... but the biggest thing I'm thinking of doing is adding my hashing power to a pool for quicker returns.

Sitting here with my mouth open watching on Bittrex seeing the price bounce effin hard

It's all speculation.  I think it'll hit between 20-50k at some point this year if previous years are any indication.   We may see an upward trend closer to July/August with a peak around November-ish before the X-mas sell off to pay off the credit cards.

Going to 5 Paddles brewery today to get me some beers to sit back and watch the show!  
Get their Sour Golden Ale! Absolutely brilliant!

True.. but it has been sitting at the 7k point for a while now.. so it has perceived value..not to mention all the positive news coming out of Japan etc.
@_date: 2018-04-22 13:20:28
I think there'll be an upward trend.  It's been similar the past several years.  People get anxious and want to pay bills and don't want to hodl and wait it out.  I cash out every year as everything I mine is profit for me at this point and I'm doing extensive renos on my house.  So any and all unforeseen money is a bonus.

George Soros finally removing the sell wall and opening the flood gates?  
Good news from Japan embracing crypto?
USA activating the military in Syrian conflict?  Seems gold is on the rise too.
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:07:44
War time people tend to dump their assets back into something that retains its value (ie gold) but seems bitcoin may also be seen as a viable option as well apparently.
