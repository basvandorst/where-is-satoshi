don't do a physical treasure hunt. here in colorado, some dude left a box of gold somewhere, deep in the hills, and several people have lost their lives looking for it. do an online thing so that nobody dies looking in some crazy place.

I prefer fundamentals and patience to TA, but some aspects of TA are rooted in mathematical truths that markets tend to follow. for example, wedges do seem to precede breakouts (price stability indicates a new mean), and there are psychological number sequences that people tend to use when setting buy and sell walls and the like that a good TA trader can detect (fibonacci), and there's also the fact that markets tend to revert to or occilate around a mean (MACD), which you can use to identify sucker's rallies and triple triangles and such. note, however, that there are very, very few good TA traders, and most of it, as you said, is BS and most of them might as well be astrologers.

it's a total valuation of the public companies in a country vs. their real money output. theoretically,  it should never go above 1 in a rational market. 
and banking/lending is always the source of a crash, but not always the cause. as you said, it's calling in leveraged accounts that crashes the stock market. in 2008, it was financial stocks specifically due to misvalued mortgages.

the only time stock market cap to GDP ratio has ever been higher (more overvalued) was right before the 2008 market meltdown. the stock market is most certainly in a bubble.

I would also like a website or script that can track real time price and power oscillator in log-log space!
