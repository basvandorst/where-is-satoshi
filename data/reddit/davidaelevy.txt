The issues presented don't seem detailed enough, eg did the transfer include an expidited fee? Did the transfers to GDAX or coinbase come from a paperwallet? Are the accounts at GDAX or coinbase properly filled out in completion? Were accounts in good standing and approved for large deposits/exchange to fiat? Ton of questions need to be honestly answered to genuinely qualify these issues.

You're trying to illicite an emotional response, and your responses come from a place of ego, not genuine helpfulness or respect for others. The portion of my 1st reply which you choose to single out *obsessively* has already been acknowledged and was only an issue due a time lapse in information by a few weeks. One person realized this and replied appropriately and intelligently. This is not about stubbornness on my end as proven by my response to the intelligent reply made by another user. This discourse between you and me escalated because of your inability to act intelligent enough to respond appropriately. You lack a great deal of perception and I dare say overall decency. I'll expound on that with the following. I'm mensa qualified but struggled with emotional intelligence until I approached my mid 30s and had children. With many "smart" people, helping others from a genuine place of humility and not ego is *rare*. The issue stems from a lack in emotional intelligence, emotional insecurity, and some selfish core motivations. Assuming the person in question is not a sociopath. Accurate assessment and perception from written communication is also rare in general. You came in here displaying a white knight syndrome with poor formatting and an overall disdain for my initial response which was not directed toward you and half of which was still valid/correct. I would think people with an actual high enough level of intelligence could easily see how that particular statement was based on information from a mere 3 to 4 weeks ago and how one could easily be out of date on that information as a result. You've been unsuccessful here, stop wasting energy, move on and find a way to improve yourself.

Giving you more attention (than this reply) Furious_Hamster to educate you doesn't benefit or interest me so I'll make this as quick. If you had acted like an adult and asked questions instead of making ignorant accusations you would have been surprised. It's pretty obvious you haven't done the work or have been approaching this wrong and/or with unfavourable conditions. Google Dunning kruger effect Mr. Furious_Hamster. If you had done the work/trials/data evaluations you would have learned something very valuable that would make you wealthy enough to not have to work a regular job if you got funded.

Hedging reduces profit yields... quite a lot. You could maybe do a futures contract on the yield rate of your mining. But that means giving up quite a bit of profit that goes over your yield mark. Which doesn't make sense as held assets tend to appreciate massively. This is for a mining business.. Daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly liquidating of crypto assets is part of the business model. But my bplan has a very fast break even point and I want to keep it that way. The 2nd year is when the magic happens for fantastic profit. But yea... I don't see how doing futures would really help at all in this business model other than incuring an unnecessary cost. It's a perfect bplan to support a single family to grow past middle class and less risk than a typical mom and pop sales or service based business.

TBH, you'll probably eventually get rekt'd by the dean unless you have permission. If I needed to use one of the computers for a project final and you told me no, I'd be verbally whooping your ass and then I'd take one anyway. This is nothing to brag about. imo you're better off using a silent miner with an informative disclaimer on some viral video website or something. This is a misuse of educational purposed equipment.

@_date: 2018-01-03 08:28:58




That validates my opinion of how you started this conversation. I do appreciate the apology though, so I'm interested in reading about the following


Then you should know better and have spent some considerable time evaluating this opportunity before coming to your conclusions and assumptions. Unless you're a CPA... I haven't found one that's spent as much energy and time to fully research this type of business.
  
If you want to educate yourself instead of being a passive aggressive sour puss... here's some free info..
* finCEN no longer classifies miners as money exchangers and an exclusive mining business faces very little red tape and regulation in USA on federal and state level (in most states) according to my attorney
* my state also put into law that transactions in blockchain are not taxable
* financing a commercial solar solution greatly offsets monthly costs to operate and holdings appreciation (if your business model holds a portion every month) can provide the opportunity to pay off that part of the loan or investment very quickly, depending on volume of assets that appreciated.
* GPU mining is nowhere near as cost effective as large scale ASIC, miners who focus exclusively on GPU mining as a business are being incredibly wasteful and inefficient. There's a TON of them approaching the business this way and their profit per watt is substantially less most of the time.
* new nm/more efficient tech is very likely releasing this year
* get a buyout agreement if you go full or partial private investment. Banks are behind with this, so getting a loan won't be easy for most people. Best bet is with a private investor provided you have a buyout agreement, otherwise you'll be crippling your potential.
* get yourself a knowledgeable business attorney
* once you commit, you can not stop until you've at least reached ZERO liabilities, and you have to stay on top of everything religiously. There's no half assing this and expecting to succeed. Every second that any part is not contributing to your mining output lowers your efficiency/output and this negative effect adds up really quick.
* Every miner should be utilized, no spares should be left unused unless you are at capacity of your electrical system. If you are at capacity, whether or not you should have spare ASIC or GPU depends on your financial model.
* learn everything you can before trying to scale and get expert help where needed, otherwise you'll likely waste a ton of time and money
  
I absolutely LOVE this business with a **passion** more than any other venture I've attempted or have worked on to date. At my current scale I'm doing very well performance wise and I'm very excited to scale, I've done the work, I've a formal education that's very applicable to this kind of venture, and I've experience giving me an edge that many others I've talked with don't have. I am not scared or deterred by the dips in value I've experienced and it has not made, at any point, my cash flow negative. Not once. I also immediately adapt where possible.  
  
This beats the hell out paying a huge amount regularly to get more customers and keeping customers. This type of income generation and career, is a significant part of our future. Get with the program or be left behind in a boring 9 to 5 job that undervalues your time.
@_date: 2018-01-23 18:48:16
Sorry but, you're dumb. An exchange of value is not the end all for this technology. And just because you can't stick it in your mouth, doesn't make it less valuable. You value the intangible software in your phones and computers more than you value most of your "stuff" you can touch. People are stupid when it comes to thinking about this long term. Even in the limited scope as an exchange of value.
@_date: 2018-01-15 21:24:09
Yep...fiat exchange services directly and majorly affect/influence the price of all major cryptocurrencies. It's not until maybe long after you can buy literally anything with crypto that it might change where a bridge is no longer commonly used. But I think that will be a LONG time down the road from now.

You know what, let's talking about behavior since you brought it up.
I'll start with your seemingly Dunning-Kruger filled side remarks 


  
ad hominem, hasty conclusion and imo damn near libel. Then the rest of that sentence is strawman and mostly a hasty generalization  
  


  
genetic and anecdotal to giving others an opinion
  


  
circular to next quoted statement, neither proves your statement, and ad ignorantiam.   
  


  
circular to above quoted statement, neither proves your statement, and ad ignorantiam.   


  
appealing to majority and wisdom of the crowd   
  


  
blinder, and it is on you to disprove/confirm/or abstain from challenging the analogy at that point, not lazily ignore and dismiss the argument presented.   
  
And you're an attorney or a law school student?

You don't get it yet then, it's not about "permission". First, say thank you to this for causing the market bounce back.  Second, this reduces FUD.  Third this is more about the senate looking into regulating the exchange services and protections concerning ICOs which will help civilize the market in offering more protection for the average consumer/investor insteading of being the current wild west. For exchanges, seasoned crypto users understand about using paper wallets and only Tx in/out of exchanges what you will immediately liquidate or transfer to your paper wallet. Most consumers/investors do not understand and will default to easy to use online wallets and even using only exchange account wallets.     If you want broader adoption of BTC and crypto and market stability.. it has to be dummy proofed and regulated via the exchanges and online wallet services. BUT.. that doesn't take away from the decentralized principles of what makes crypto so fantastic. This will reduce abuse and theft risk for the average crypto user in USA that uses an USA based exchange or online wallet. Wether you like it or not.. it is happening.. and you should spend considerable time understanding what was discussed in the hearing.
