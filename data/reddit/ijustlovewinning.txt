It's just the people that "invested" in bitcoin when it was at $800+ that are a little butt hurt. 
I got mine at $700-something, but whatever. I made a mistake. Not bitcoin's fault... 
@_date: 2015-06-13 04:39:17
Yeah, it's terrible on mobile.. (I obviously went to the site for research on bitcoin *cough*) 
@_date: 2015-06-15 13:59:30
You held on to them, though? Or did you spend them at $2?
@_date: 2015-06-15 18:59:01
So, you're saying you're a rich man now?

I switched from an iPhone 5 to a Moto G, and believe it or not, aside from the quality of the camera, I'm not missing the iPhone at all. 
Not being able to have a bitcoin wallet was one of the reasons for my switch.

I set up bitpay in 5 minutes for my company. It even had a plugin for the shopping cart we use. Couldn't be easier. 
@_date: 2014-02-10 19:15:13
At bitpay, you can choose the percentage of fiat vs bitcoin you want to be paid in. We have it set for 90% CAD and 10% bitcoin, I believe.

Drinking game: take a shot every time this insecure guy says "secure" or "security".. 
Happy drinks..

It's actions like this that regain my respect for Microsoft.
@_date: 2014-09-01 17:36:37
Sooo, like bittorrent...? 
@_date: 2014-02-10 14:44:36
Don't know. Coinbase was not available to me at the time (I'm in Canada), so I didn't look into it. 
@_date: 2016-06-13 17:17:58
I agree. I'm not just going to randomly spend it just because. There are a few electronics on my list that I was saving up for.
It's just that I broke the universal rule of "buy low, sell high". I kind bought high and haven't sold yet.
@_date: 2016-06-13 17:24:09
When I bought, I was hoping it would become more mainstream with more payment options. After 2.5 years, it's still considered "virtual money" by most.
I didn't really buy it as an investment but more as spending money. I still have to search for (online) retailers that support Bitcoin, and they often don't have what I'm looking for, so it's money in a wallet that I can't use. I'd rather be able to spend it.
That sounds like I've lost hope but that's not it...
@_date: 2018-10-07 14:53:28
You're in the cart. Bitcoin might shown up in the actual checkout. These buttons are just a "quick checkout"...
@_date: 2016-06-13 17:06:59
Ok, but eventually I'll have to do something with them, either selling or spending. Which is preferable?
@_date: 2016-06-13 21:45:49
If we're going on what-ifs, I wouldn't have bought Bitcoin in the first place. What if it tanks?
@_date: 2016-06-13 21:45:16
I'm not in the US, so that won't go (unless that changed?)
@_date: 2016-06-13 21:46:17
I don't really need to spend. It would just be nice to finally do something with those coins after so long :)
@_date: 2016-06-13 16:56:37
Same here!
@_date: 2019-08-31 05:01:06
I've heard about them, but the last time I tried accessing the site, it wouldn't load due to a server error. Are they solid otherwise?
@_date: 2019-08-31 05:02:18
I'll have a look. Thanks.

I've used coinsquare. Their fees used to be terribly high. Has that changed at all?
@_date: 2019-08-31 15:22:17
Thank you! I just read some reviews and they all seem to be a pretty positive.
One mentioned they used to convert btc into prepaid cards. Were they called Coincards before? I've used them...
@_date: 2019-08-31 14:09:07
What would make you a shill? Do you work at Shakepay?
@_date: 2019-08-31 16:46:18
You weren't kidding. I just bought some on Shakepay. That was super easy!
Thanks for being that shill ☺️
@_date: 2019-08-31 14:10:50
Great list, but that doesn't tell me anything about if they're good, bad, shady or if they have high fees.
Personal recommendations is what I'm looking for.
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:47:05
So true. I have coworkers that are losing their minds over the price right now because they bought at $20k.
Here I am, sitting on my stash that I bought at $700.. Meh, indeed.
@_date: 2019-09-02 02:17:20
A nurse with $10m in "the bank". Right.
@_date: 2019-09-06 04:33:41
Thanks. I signed up with Shakepay over the weekend. You're right. Super quick and easy!

It's security. If a random guy with a camera walked up to me on the street, offering the chocolate bar or a piece of silver, I'd think twice too. Here's why:
* who tells me that piece of silver is real? 
* who says it's not stolen? 
* what do I do with it? Not like I can walk into a grocery store and pay with it. 
* wil my bank ask questions? Do I even bring it to my bank? 
The chocolate bar is instant gratification and no hassle. 
All the uncertainties I mention about silver apply to Bitcoin. However, if there was a thing about silver all over the news and social media, saying "silver is now worth a fortune, you can pay with it everywhere", I might rethink my decision to go with the chocolate bar. 
Same goes for people that don't own a credit card. Doesn't make them stupid. It just makes their priorities and the way they think different. 
@_date: 2016-05-09 17:01:43
Sure. We'll go with that. 
@_date: 2016-05-08 21:52:58
This is exactly the mentality that keeps people away from bitcoin. Keep calling people who are new to Bitcoin dumb. See where that gets us... 
@_date: 2016-05-09 14:42:56
You're correct, but if I take and trade a stolen piece of silver, I'd probably be in more trouble than eating a stolen, expired chocolate bar.. 
Are you this judgemental towards your clients as well? 
@_date: 2015-03-19 04:09:54
Same here.. Mine were $728 or something.. Wheeee indeed.. 
@_date: 2016-05-09 15:46:04
And average person doesn't even know what to do with a piece of silver, let alone Bitcoin.
Interesting to see your greedy nature. Most people would say "thank you" instead of "Do you have more where that came from?"
It's not about being dumb. It's about not knowing, but I guess you really know everything about everything, so to you, everybody would be dumb, right?
I don't even know why I keep replying to you. You won't be able to see anyone else's point of view anyway.

Found everything I needed! My company is now accepting Bitcoin :)
@_date: 2013-11-29 14:06:00
Yeah, exactly. And lower processing fees? I did some research but haven't found the fees yet. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 01:20:21
Could be 75 cents tomorrow.. or 30 the day after..

Is it my phone or do others have issues loading the page on mobile? It crashes both AlienBlue (iOS reddit client) and Safari.

When China adopts it, value will soar and iPhone accessories will get even cheaper. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 05:26:23
I've been following Bitcoin for 2 weeks intensively now, but the one thing I've learned up until now: Don't panic when the price drops..
@_date: 2013-11-29 14:08:53
Yes, I found that one. I think we'll install that today and start accepting it right away. Would it be cheesy to make the same kind of announcement as OP?
@_date: 2013-11-29 14:07:12
That's exactly what I was hoping for. Accept btc and hold it right now is not a bad idea, but in 2 weeks from now, that might be different. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 05:35:57
So, the "base price" is in usd, and bitpay converts that live to btc to whatever the price is at that time? I would seriously consider offering that method in my hosting company.

I'm a newbie. I downloaded QT at first. When I saw the sync would take days, I immediately looked for an alternative and found Multibit. It works, I guess, but I have a lot to learn.
