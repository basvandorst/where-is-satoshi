I'd be impressed if they could link those 6 deaths to SR, it's just a number they throw around for shock 'n awe.

Please, I'd be willing to bet there is someone in your circle of friends who knows a guy who can get you something if you went looking. Nearly nobody gets their drugs, the first time, from a dealer.

I've spend way more BTC then i'm holding. Anonymous digital money turns out to be pretty handy.

Ok, I got a change to read the part about Jordan M. It does seem pretty damning. On the other hand you could argue this was a first time heroine user who decided to mix two other hard drugs during his first time. I can see the appeal of pinning that on Ross but, I don't want to seem apologetic, I don't think you could argue that was directly Ross or SR's fault. 
I hate this part about SR. On the one hand people who are 'pro' argue that SR is probably saving lives because there is less contact with dealers and less risk for users. People who are against argue people are dying as a direct result of SR. None of those arguments can really be conclusively proven but they are important arguments in the discussion about hard drugs. Unfortunately for Ross that discussion does not take place in the courts, although both sides certainly tried to embelish the facts with their arguments.
Where did the 'six deaths' originated from? I can't find the original source. Thanks for the read btw

Fake news wasn't rhe correct term to use but his point is solid

Does the whole claim go to fiat? I would assume people would rather have their BTC made whole again.

Do not sell until you are well informed by your own research!

The only example they made out of that trail is how shitty the US legal system is

Any trader would have told you not to do that. As soon as it was below 7k the point of selling was over if you are risk adverse, which you should be. Especially all of it. Enter and exit the markets gradually is a core concept in trading.

The evidence for that are a couple of journal entries from someone who had already thought about having his story written in a book.
There is zero evidence that it actually happened and rest assured they tried to find out. They couldnt even find the btc payments while they had the adresses.
People give this guy way to much credit as some big kingpin when in reality his incompetence was baffling. Great initial idea though.
