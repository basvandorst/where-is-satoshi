Bitcoin fees are the price you pay for your transaction to get confirmed on the network. If your fee isn't high enough, it won't compete with other transactions that have higher fee offerings, and will take a LONG time to process, if ever (though unlikely it gets stuck forever). 
Right now, the bitcoin transaction backlog is HUGE, and as such, fees to get your tx processed in a short amount of time are proportionately huge. 
It's not your wallet's problem. The network is just congested.

I'm curious to know how you think this would work.
If you get 3,000 people to invest 5 dollars, you'll have nearly enough for one bitcoin @ 15k.
Then assume 5 years from now, that bitcoin is worth 1.5M (a 100x increase). Assuming you split everything up fairly, you pay out $1.5M / 3000 people = $500 per person. They would have gained this *even if they didn't join your group and just bought/held $5 of bitcoin on their own*.
You're sellin' a scam, not an investment strategy.

This is still no better than somebody taking out a $5 position of bitcoin on their own. If they gain 10,000% return with your fund that invests $5 directly into bitcoin, they will gain the same return just buying that bitcoin on their own. If anything, if that fund really does invest directly into bitcoin, then it is *less* efficient than buying your own bitcoin, because their product does not seem to allow buying fractional units.

Doubtful that it was institutional money, if you ask me. The entire point of futures is being able to bet on the performance of an investment without having to actually own that investment.

You either trust them or you don't, plain and simple. The source code for all of their apps is open source, the only closed source firmware they use is for their secure chip that stores and manages your private keys.
As for backups, those are a [BIP39 standard]( so even if you feel like you can't trust another hardware wallet to restore your backup, you'll still be able to do it via a software wallet if you ever wanted.
Edit: And if you're curious about improvements to their hard wallet, I recently found out they publish a [roadmap]( It might make you feel better to see all of the improvements they are working on, as well as everything they've finished. You can see the "Done" stuff at the very right.

Consider opportunity cost of investing. Sure, you may not double your money, but what's the other option anyways? Traditional investments consider a 7% return on average per year to be *reasonable*. Making 10% is supposed to be a *great* year. 
So, if a long time in the future, your options are to make 20% in bitcoin, or 10% in the BEST case scenario with traditional investments, which would you pick?

You could do that, but you also need to take into consideration:
1. Speed of transactions
2. Market volatility
3. Withdrawal limits
4. Capital gains taxes
5. Transaction fees
6. Available personal capital
It is very appealing, no doubt, but the combined factors above usually make it difficult to earn a good profit. You may be able to make a few percent of your available capital over time, but it's going to require you to always be watching and trading.

We need some kind of official response to give people with this question...it would be good to have something informative to assist people that are new to the community, to help them make a decision, instead of just forcing opinions down their throats. I'll take a stab at it, please spare me any harsh criticism. My goal is to be clear and avoid the politics, but I'm doing this off the top of my head, and by no means am I the next Andreas.
Bitcoin began as an experiment. Its goal, among other things, was to provide a secure, transparent, and decentralized currency. It was to be free from banks, giving users the freedom to safely manage, spend, and store their funds. In regards to the BTC vs BCH battle, our primary focus is the "decentralized" aspect. Note that there are other factors aside from decentralization that are discussed in this debate, but this is the biggest one.
What is decentralization with regards to Bitcoin? It's the ability for Bitcoin to be free from any central agency or small set of users for authority or governance. There should be no CEO deciding how the software evolves. There should be no President managing the rules of the ecosystem. All of the power should be in the hands of the community and its users, with each of them having an equal weight of opinion. In other words, every vote should be equal.
Part of what gives Bitcoin this decentralization is the ability for ANY user to join and support the infrastructure. The requirements to do this began as simple as having a run-of-the-mill computer, without any need for especially expensive equipment. A subset of those PC requirements is the need to have room for storing the blockchain (the system of record for Bitcoin) and the ability to send and receive blocks for adding to the chain. Initially, Bitcoin defined each block to have a size of 1 MB, that is one megabyte. This is the key difference between the BTC vision and the BCH vision, which I will get to shortly.
At first, this was plenty of space per block to ensure that each transaction sent by a user was processed in a timely manner. Over time, as Bitcoin became more popular (especially this past 6 months!) the 1 MB block size became too small to handle the huge number of transactions being transmitted. What used to take hours, now takes days. This is an issue of Bitcoin needing to *scale* to support a large number of transactions.
The BTC community quickly recognized that a scaling solution needed to be *agreed upon*. Remember when I said that everybody gets an "equal vote" in the evolution of Bitcoin? Well, there was disagreement among the Bitcoin community on how exactly scaling should be implemented. There are two schools of thought here:
1. Scale on chain: The idea that Bitcoin should handle the scaling issue by increasing the block size, in order to keep *all* of the transaction information, no matter how insignificant any piece of data may be, on the chain.
2. Scale off chain: The idea that Bitcoin should not need to put EVERY transaction on the chain, and that scaling can be handled off-chain (via other technologies), with only final settlement being recorded on-chain.
While it seems like an insignificant difference between the two, there is concern that the solutions above will have an impact on the *decentralization* of Bitcoin. Some of the most commonly discussed factors are (and I'm trying to be neutral here):
1. Big block sizes can lead to centralization, because as the Blockchain becomes larger to store, it becomes harder for users to join and support the community due to the need to buy more equipment.
2. Big block sizes can lead to centralization, because as blocks become larger, they also take longer to send and receive, which causes users that are geographically closer to each other to have an advantage, and also requires users to have a faster internet connection to remain relevant.
3. Small block sizes can lead to centralization, because scaling off-chain will require new technologies that are not necessarily designed to be easy for every user to implement. 
4. Small block sizes can lead to centralization, because scaling off-chain may end up relying upon a small set of users to manage the off-chain solutions. (similar to point 3 above, slightly different)
Bitcoin thinks Small Blocks are best, and the speed issue can be solved with an off-chain solution that is currently in the works.
Bitcoin Cash thinks Big Blocks are the best idea, and the speed issue can be resolved immediately by increasing the size of the blockchain.
Who is right? Nobody can tell you. You have to make your own decision. I won't offer my opinion because I think every user should decide for themselves. And on top of that, your decision should not be based on my short description here, it should involve more research, or at least asking the community more questions. It's a complex topic.

Disagree. Both. This is going to change wildly over the coming years, but I would follow this until you know any better:
"Self-employed individuals with Bitcoin gains or losses from sales transactions also must convert the virtual currency to dollars as of the day earned, and report the figures on their tax returns."
"If the Bitcoins are held as a capital asset, like stocks or bonds, any gain or loss from the sale or exchange of the asset is taxed as a capital gain or loss. Otherwise, the investor realizes ordinary gain or loss on an exchange."

My 2cents on the matter:
Banks are not in business because they give money to people. Quite the opposite, obviously. They will *definitely* take advantage of blockchain technology as a means of augmenting their systems, but I doubt their coins will be considered highly valuable. For this to be true, the coins would have to be redeemable for a combination of money, goods, or services. A bank would likely incentivize participating on their blockchain, but the rewards would be crummy in comparison to the rewards that our present crypto coins provide. 
Consider your credit card as an example. You are incentivized to use it, no doubt! But how much do you get? 1-3% of your purchase, if even that! A bank's "cryptocurrency" would be no different. You are not their customer, you are their product.

No matter what part of the world you're in, this advice is universal: Don't invest what you can't afford to lose. 
Other than that, invest whenever you want, nobody can tell you whether it should be now or later. A dip may come tomorrrow, it may come in a month, it may miraculously never go down. Consider your money effectively gone regardless of when you invest it, and you'll be less disappointed if the outcome isn't in your favor.

Maybe every 10m users then? :) I doubt any company would completely turn down a chance for some PR displaying their increasing adoption.

A holiday season where people notoriously gather and make small talk over the news, where Bitcoin is being discussed on every financial space, where financial gains are minting millionaires from previously broke ass people, where a new technology is disrupting a centuries-old business sector, does not constitute even a little bit of a reason for a recent spike? Really?

The price can adjust downwards too. Just sayin'.

Based on your post history, I get the feeling you're trying to inflate your number of posts to balance out the shilling you're doing for your blog.

Here ya go, friend:

Better off spending your time having fun and making friends! You only get to be that age once. If you really want to, work with your parents and see if they'll open an account for you to put in $20. Bitcoin has tax implications that are going to confuse the hell out of you at this stage of your life. I think most exchanges are going to require you to be 18 anyways, assuming you're in the U.S.

Lesson learned. If you made a profit, there's no shame in buying back, if you really wanted.
There's also no shame in dropping out of the race. Everybody has a different appetite for risk. What would you be saying tomorrow if BTC dropped to zero?

They'll probably still update it, just not on the increment they were previously. It would get old to update it even once a day. Might as well just update it on bigger milestones. Maybe every million users or so.

Good shitpost, I sincerely enjoyed it. I'll have to mull this one over next time I pack a bowl.
