why not call µBTC "bits"?

ebay would have no record of payment and if you don't ship they can't take the money back. It would get exploited a lot.

It should be noted that I did not win...

why use linux? you can create a paper wallet on windows offline too.

bitcoinwisdom gives a high of 395 and low of 290 for mtgox. that's a 26.6% drop. I will admit it wasn't at 290 for very long though.

@_date: 2013-11-24 20:51:42
can you explain why people keep giving you bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-11-10 08:05:45
It's more stable that way since we're still in the early stages.
@_date: 2013-10-24 18:48:55
that's why I bought some (watch it crash to like 80 tomorrow)

big question, can you afford to lose 1 million dollars? If yes, do it.
@_date: 2013-10-23 03:54:05
y'all are going to hate me for this, but i think it's time to sell.
@_date: 2013-10-21 14:04:04
high odds it will crash, but it'll recover to about 150.
@_date: 2013-11-06 19:01:02
they wouldn't need to use silkroad for cannabis then, but there's other stuff that's still illegal.
@_date: 2013-11-10 00:32:17
except that you can't withdraw usd from mtgox to your bank.
@_date: 2013-11-04 00:57:45
they very well could have
@_date: 2013-11-24 20:53:31
that's the second rule, the first is "buy low sell high".

who named it that?
@_date: 2013-10-31 16:56:06
what are these dollars you speak of?
@_date: 2013-11-06 05:11:42
I'm still confused as to why you would want to spend bitcoin instead of dollars at this time. The price is going up, so saving bitcoins for the furture and spending dollars now seems more cost effective. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:52:21
you lost me

@_date: 2013-11-12 00:47:15
I don't now half the words you said, nor (i guess) what op is trying to do. I just downloaded the thing from bitaddress.org
@_date: 2013-11-10 06:13:19
at the max decline, on the graph, the dollar lost 44% of its value in 3 years. Over all 46 years it lost 33% of its value (less than 1% inflation rate). Bitcoin lost 25% of its value in an hour. Over the last year bitcoin's value gained 2600%. Conclusion, bitcoin good for speculation and dollar good for buying things.
@_date: 2013-11-10 00:51:06
lol, i don't know where to exchange yuan for usd, but airport currency exchanges usually have a fee. there's a reason for price differences between markets, you probably won't be able arbitrage or everyone would be doing it.
@_date: 2013-10-24 19:56:11
because you can't get your money out of mtgox
@_date: 2013-11-08 02:18:46
wait what? what do you mean on the bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-12-25 04:29:56
I wish there was a way to make these where you could spend it by scanning the code, but that's just not secure. 
@_date: 2013-10-23 06:08:45
I think you have to add "verify" to that
Edit: my bad
@_date: 2013-12-15 02:43:33
It means he's kidding
@_date: 2013-11-08 21:15:19
don't you pay by sending money to the wallet that he made. If i paid with bitcoin, i wouldn't go through the trouble of printing out a paper wallet.

The thing is, if people downvoted memes here to shit, no one would post them. I assume that because they get upvoted, people here in general like them.
@_date: 2013-11-10 04:39:35
well why don't you visit the site for yourself? 
@_date: 2013-10-03 02:26:59
saw it was 103 on coinbase (didn't know what happened yet), bought a little, then it went to 92 and decided to buy more if it fell another time (it didn't) then it quickly went up to 115 and back to 105. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 01:53:28
you seem very confident in that.
@_date: 2013-11-10 06:05:05

@_date: 2013-10-23 20:24:23
it seems like, by the rate it's going up, it will also make a sharp decline in price, at which point you should buy. I retract my statement before to sell though, just sit on any bitcoin you have.
(I bought about .5 btc at ~130 and sold it at 162, probably shouldn't have sold it)
@_date: 2013-11-08 02:24:45
you mean on the Casascius physical bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-11-15 15:42:50
Basically the password is used to decrypt the private key, so someone would need the encrypted key and the password. Also, the bip0038 algorithms take a relatively long time to operate, making it very hard to brute force the password. So yes a weak password is better than none.
@_date: 2013-11-05 05:13:29
interesting how the bitcoin was spread out and is now at these 4 addresses:
Edit: they are being split more.
@_date: 2013-10-24 18:52:10

It's a deleted comment
@_date: 2013-11-13 19:35:41
they don't
@_date: 2013-10-27 17:29:51
Just buy bitcoin with the money you'd pay for the miner.
@_date: 2013-10-23 17:59:33
and now they're worth $400!!
@_date: 2013-10-25 20:08:35
they're not trying to stop bitcoin or other virtual currencies, they're just stopping "silkroads" where they can. you shouldn't expect anything different. 
@_date: 2013-10-24 16:09:04
yoo 7 dollars is expensive man, i can only buy like a gazillion bitcoins at that rate.
@_date: 2013-10-22 19:39:49
because there's a fee to send it to another account
@_date: 2013-10-23 03:42:06
i feel like they should have the standard in units of bitcoin. 1 dollar in bitcoin today is a lot less than it was a week ago
edit: maybe a default of ฿0.005?
@_date: 2013-11-15 17:10:22
Nope, if someone does manage to get access to my bitcoin, they deserve them.
edit for the person who downvoted me: 
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:29:38
i believe it goes to seans' charity.

@_date: 2013-10-23 03:44:51
does bitcointip give the bitcoin to whoever you posted under? because no one ever specifies a username when they use it.

I hate to say this but it's not that useful. you can't spend your coins or check if you received them from someone else. 
It looks nice though...
Edit: thanks for the downvotes. It was a serious concern. I still like the idea.
@_date: 2013-10-24 16:10:27
just curious (if you don't mind sharing), but how much are these "small quantities"?

i wouldn't call germany 1929 a wealthy nation. 
Also something i learned recently that I thought was ridiculous was that Germany paid the last of its reparations from the treaty of Versailles (WWI) in 2010. 
@_date: 2013-12-25 07:06:16
that might work. I don't know how I feel about reusing it afterward though and making a new keychain each time is impractical.
@_date: 2013-10-23 06:06:39

well the site is up and running along with several alternatives if that's what you're asking. Also, you basically just download a file and run it to use tor.
@_date: 2013-12-11 16:46:42
I assume that only the public key is on the keychain. How did you give him the private key, just on paper?

@_date: 2013-09-30 21:28:10
you could have just bought bitcoins with that money...

@_date: 2013-10-24 21:00:00
dude I swear I just went through exactly what you did. I bought .5 btc after making a post here. I'm keeping that shit for the long run.

@_date: 2013-12-11 05:58:16
Dude, what the fuck is a cyber school?
@_date: 2013-12-07 16:26:24
Is that why you can buy less with bitcoin now but the same amount with dollars?
@_date: 2013-10-18 20:02:11
can someone explain how this could happen?
