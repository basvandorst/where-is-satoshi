Isn't this somewhat dealt with by prediction markets like Augur? You let people bet on the future in the blockchain, and now other contracts can do lookups. Yes, it can be faked, but those who accurately predict (even if they don't end up swaying the consensus) eventually get rich, and those gaming the system continue to bleed money as reality comes up differently.

Dude. They clearly have crazy amounts of technical debt in their product. They need to be usurped by someone who's had a fresh run at the problems and opportunities.
They're not cut out for the league they're in -- they don't have the business chops (support? community engagement? partnerships?), nor the technical chops. I love them as humans, but I can't love them as product owners.

I like you. Thank you for taking the time to explain. You're right, Coinbase's services should eventually be replaced with another model.
I would be a little surprised if Coinbase did not offer these escrow services at some point in the future. If they don't, I'd hope we would consider switching to the first stable service that does. Until a proper and user-friendly escrow service exists, Coinbase is solving a real need for Gittip to support Bitcoin :)

This has nothing to do with anything we're talking about here. We're talking about supporting development. If you think they're doing a good job on a good product, support them. It takes all of 30 seconds with the grep command to fix this perceived branding problem once the project development is near-complete, and the developers can't stop you from running that A/B test when the time comes :)

Coinbase will become an institution like a bank, who at it's foundations is selling "trust". I'd rather trust and vet the reputation of one institution rather than each vendor I patronize. The choice seems to be between:
1. Prepay with each vendor rather than use recurring payments, trusting *each vendor* to promptly refund prorated fees if I stop early.
2. Keep sufficient bitcoin for recurring payments in an institution like Coinbase, vetting only that one institution for trustworthiness (including on-demand access to my money, and presumably [future features that ensure non-fractional reserve service](
In regards to your last paragraph, I'm forming my opinion on Coinbase-like institutions based on the expected future circumstances -- that eventually they will be insured and every bit as secure as banks and PayPal today.
I'm just saying that they serve a specific purpose and it's not traitorous to Bitcoin to use them, even if you believe in certain "ideals" of Bitcoin :)

The reality is that our computers have not seen the requisite pressure to be secure up until recently, now that real monetary wealth and not just our privacy is at stake.
I personally feel that as bitcoin becomes mainstream, it will provide the much-needed pressure to make consumer computing as secure as it should be. The cost of hardware/software insecurity right now is a silent loss of power and privacy to unknown parties who "bank" it for later, but an attacker of bitcoin is encouraged to steal that monetary value ASAP in a way that is very visible to the victim. This will actually be a positive force in terms of driving security practices that will ultimately leave us all better off :)

heh I guess I wasn't putting in sufficient effort to reproduce the whole analogy, but just looking for someone for whom it rang a bell :)
The full thing was pretty articulate. The idea was that even the tiniest security hole has devastating, immediate and obvious consequences for system end-users, whereas previously a small hole could exist in every system on earth for years and different groups would silently discover and use these vulnerabilities sereptitiously. I think the general phrase was that bitcoin turns every computer holding bitcoin into a container full of high pressure money, and the smallest leaks in systems become evident (like a small leak in any high-pressure container under watch)

Bitcoin is very intentionally "push" (and doesn't support "pull") payments, which puts it at a huge disadvantage against the incumbents like credit cards and traditional digital fiat. Services like Coinbase are filling a need that the Bitcoin protocol currently can't (and maybe never can), which is recurring payments that are out of mind for both payers and merchants.
I can't speak for other marketplaces, but what Coinbase offers is absolutely critical for Bitcoin at Gittip, which is about recurring and sustainable crowdfunding, not one-time gifts.
If not for Coinbase and the way it handles payments, then that would mean Bitcoin cannot serve Gittip's model, which would be huge bummer in my books! (I am loopy for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies :)

Drupal, the CMS that powers maybe 2% of the internet, has an ecommerce add-on called Ubercart which [has bitcoin support](
Having said that, [Drupal Commerce]( is the new replacement for Ubercart, and it's much more pluggable.
I'd say the main thing to get a grip on is dynamic exchange rate conversion. People might be willing to accept bitcoin, but they'll want to price things in dollars that they understand. Bitcoin prices should be converted based on current rates, or average across x days, or whatever the standard is among currency conversion services.

Wat. This isn't true. A payment transfer system just needs consistently valued tokens, priced the same between when the spender converts into them, and when the receiver converts out. That's why Bitcoin's volatility doesn't matter to people using it for remittance. The blockchain tokens, like ether for instance, could be worth $0.001, but if it's consistent through the trade (sender USD -&gt; sender ether -&gt; receiver ether -&gt; receiver USD) now you can ignore the token value and just focus on what the blockchain system claims to offer (of which I'll allow you to do your own research on ethereum, and decide if it's value-add is interesting to you).

I like this idea, but i'm not sure it can spread sufficiently fast if it's spreading at the rate of flashing router firmware. For awhile, I've been meaning to start on an ethereum PoC for creating a registry of wifi credentiial and GPS coordinates in its blockchain. If you simply create a decentralized ledger of credentials, all the worries about regulations go away, for better or for worse. The down side is that anyone could put someone else's wifi into the ledger. So going forward, you'd better hope you trust everyone who has your wifi password, I guess.
Someone mentioned 3G rendering your idea moot, but I disagree: Cell band data will always have a higher cost than wifi, as the latter is just the last mile (or feet?) that are wireless, and the rest is wired. Costs are lower or neglible via wifi.
The MVP, at least for mobile, would be to create an android app that can manage wifi hotspot entries, performing lookups in the blockchain ledger (via cellular data), but then connecting to available wifi hotspots for the bulk of the data transfer. There would also be a UI for submission of sets of credentials when you connect manually to an unlisted SSID.
Yes, https is not everywhere yet, so it would be bad for insecure networks. Kinda not our problem that the internet is still broken though. Also, lots of routers are not nearly as secure as they should be. Call me an asshole, but also kinda not our problem.
Anyhow, harder to monetize, obviously. But your monetization scheme requires the routers to be in on it. That seems like a deal-breaker, in all honesty.
Anyhow, I'm really eager to talk about these idea if you want to meet up on skype or jitsi meet. (Don't worry, I'm happy to let you guys do the company thing without me :) Hit me up on Twitter at  if you're interested.
NINJA EDIT: I'm not committed to Ethereum btw. Just seems like wifi credentials are a silly thing to stick in the bitcoin blockchain...?

I left a comment elsewhere speaking against the idea of expecting a solution with custom firmware to work BUT if it did end up becoming a thing, I think there is some interesting emergent coolness that arrives when you have router firmware designed with bitcoin in mind, and random people routing through them. If you have a corroborated directory of router locations, perhaps via [Mozilla Location Services]( and if the firmware has a unique cryptographic ID, then you could use the quick pings/signatures between the routers and devices to prove location in an irrefutable way. The router can vouche that a device is actually right beside it, because the ping is near-intantaneous.
This might also help down the road with proving that a network is distributed geographically, which isn't provable with cryptography alone. This could perhaps (far far down the road), help reward nodes for being geographically separated...

If you're not a staunch libertarian, and appreciated up until now that taxes paid for important things, please consider just paying them. Otherwise, you're falling into the trap that we chronically blame "the 1%" for: tax evasion.
If you genuinely are a libertarian and feel that taxes have no place in your life, then go to town -- your position is morally consistent :)

But... this level we're at right now is all before people even have a real *chance* to engage with the economy. Doesn't it change dramatically as people have ways to spend bitcoin, and it gradually becomes something of value? A bicycle for 100 mBTC. A carton of milk for 1 mBTC. Blah blah blah
Right now, essentially none of that exists. How can this possibly be representative. Shouldn't we wait for all the VC's and angel investors to finish pouring their money in, and then decide. We haven't even waited for the last tech startup to crash and burn, so how is this not premature?
I just don't see this as over. I can't imagine how it could be over. The implications of the technology are just too huge to ignore. (I'm a tech guy, btw.)

What if the community of exchanges directly agreed to some sort of system where they all shut down when they detected DDoS's. Some might stick with the anarchist spirit and avoid the collaborative effort, but if the coordinating exchanges enjoyed more stability, people would bail on the ones vulnerable to massive manipulation
Could we create a decentralized means to allow any exchange to take part in this coordinated shutdown? Does that mitigate concerns -- ie. when any unaffiliated party can start an exchange and join the coordinated anti-manipulation effort? If this coordination system ever became anti-consumer, then a new exchange could swoop in and pick up the dissatisfied users.

But keep in mind that the $0.40 is the floating value. The pinned value is 0.0035 btc. So by the time we've saturated the network with the max 7 transactions/second, a btc will likely be worth way more -- ie. $10 transaction fees :/
Off-chain transactions are looking prettier all the time

No offense, but that's FUD. They're people. They think for themselves. 
The community will thrust others into the limelight if the core devs stop representing the will of the majority. But obviously, the will of the majority is changing as Bitcoin goes mainstream. We're currently discovering the equilibrium political milieu.
We need to accept that fact that rhe system might not even blink if all the non-statist bail (for whatever reason), if this happens late in the game. I'm personally hoping the inflationary experiment follows through to completion, and I'm hoping the mainstream majority agrees, but who knows.

If I understand correctly, the idea is that they *do* replace them for small transactions. You have centralized payment processors who deal in small transactions, and they have cryptographic auditing measures to account for the bitcoin they claim to act in lieu of, so that any user can audit them at any point and ensure that the amount they've entrusted to them is still in storage and not being used for fractional reserve-like activities. The idea is that these payment processor handle the huge load without a huge public ledger, and they're held cryptographically accountable for the small sections of the economy that they run.
I admit I'm somewhat fuzzy on the details, but it just sounded like you had a different understanding that I did of off-chain transactions.

If it had a pluggable part that was open source, then it could integrate with any site that allows oauth authentication (Facebook, Google, SoundCloud, StackOverflow). Oauth would be the way that a redeemer proved they're the person who got tipped on the other site.
*EDIT: [Like GitHub does with GitHub Services integration]( /EDIT.* 
And the tip service would only need to specifically monitor the feeds of the people on other connected sites who have signed up on the tip service. So if I connected my tipping service with Facebook and SoundCloud account, it would just need to use the API's of those sites to track what I was posting, and then act when it "hears" me using the keyphrase :)

Yep, the way he talks about spending being weak (ie hoarding instead of growing the economy and... y'know... *contributing*)...

He's laying the groundwork for a nouveau riche mentality, with all the same terrible sense of entitlement that we dislike in the established rich of today.

I guess that's where we differ. If taxation isn't "sharing" in letter, it's "sharing" in spirit, or at least the only systemic proxy for it that we can muster with our current institutions. I feel society would be deprived of many sources of public good if we abandoned our ways for libertarian ideals atm, without functional and distributed systems of accountability and reputation (akin to bitcoin, but for legislation, trust, etc.)
But I do respect your optimism. I want to believe libertarian ideals would work without accountability, but I just can't.
@_date: 2013-05-10 12:29:46
Great project guys. Maybe you'll disregard me, but I highly recommend you consider adopting the Travis CI business model: radically transparent in code, but supported through ferociously loyal customers who literally would rather throw money at you than rebuild what you've open sourced.
I personally think its only a matter of weeks before someone open sources a piece of base infrastructure like this. You want to build community support in good faith by open sourcing, or else that future team will reap the benefits and support from doing so.
Just my two cents. Again, awesome project and awesome work :)

My understanding is that the economics are really hard to predict. You're trying to predict lots of wildcard stuff, relating to output of current ASIC producers, chances of new ones entering the market, delays in product lines/shipping.
Keep in mind, the analysis above is largely my own. I'm sure many would disagree and say that the value of current ASIC miners if still recoupable and profitable. It's the wildcard stuff I mentioned above where our opinions would differ :)
I've never used this tool seriously, but there are a few like it floating around, although I think they still simplify things quite a bit.

No. Really. If you're dealing with significant amounts of money (maybe later on?), encrypt your keys and make sure multiple people are needed to decrypt. And make it public that you do that, so as to discourage extortionists. You never know what one of your employees might be compelled to do if they received an envelope full of pictures of your family and a death threat.

Bitcoin has no purpose. It's a technology. If someone has an interest in using it to drive down the costs of an established industry, they're free to try.

@_date: 2013-05-12 22:18:39
haha no, it's not like that. Basically, I'm investing time and effort in educating friends about bitcoin, then giving them some of my investment.   I'm settling IOUs with friends, not random transactional acquaintances, and giving it to them so that they have skin in the game. I'd much rather pay them in cash, all things equal, since that's "worth less" in my mind. I'm straddling the line between speculator and evangelist, and I'm irritated when a technically-minded friend who never gambles, acts like I just gave them something worthless, despite having spent an hour walking them through how bitcoin works on the backend. If you still think I'm being judgemental, then I suppose we just evangelize differently.
@_date: 2013-06-08 19:23:24
Either bitcoin is a low-volume but ubiquitous backbone, or its everyday transactions akin to Mastercard.
Mastercard peaks at 4M transactions/hour during Black Friday sales:
That's 1111 transactions/second
That's a 170x increase in capacity (above our 7/sec) that's needed to confirm transactions, and that's just to match mastercard. People talk about this being a replacement for cash. Mastercard, for all it is, is not expected to be a microtransaction payment system, but lots of people think bitcoin is going to be one.
Anyhow, I don't know how this will play out, I'm just not all aboard with the "let's just scale up the network" approach, as if it didn't have big consequences on how bitcoin develops :)

I'm more interested in the societal transformation.

Many of them have strong beliefs on how the world should work. Some of these may be bat-shit crazy, but at least they're not same-old, same-old. And these people will have a huge chunk of the money in the system. And really, how much worse is this than the current situation with 60% of the wealth being trapped in a tiny percentage, many of whom we recognize as corrupt and/or batshit crazy themselves?

Sorry, reading back on my other comment, it came across as know-it-all.
That's awesome that you're selling at list prices, but the psychology of this is that people are averse to "fees" and inclined to be attracted to "discounts". That's how most large companies structure their incentives. You could write "We sell at list price!" all over your site, so that no one could possibly miss that fact, but yet people will still be struck by a "fee" for bitcoin that they're not accustomed to seeing for credit card or paypal.
I'm only beating the dead horse with this because I want a bitcoin business such as yourself to succeed as maximally as possible! I really think you should reconsider.

That's odd. I specifically told them I was from Canada to make sure it was ok. They're new to the credit union thing though, so it's likely that they're learning new things all the time.
As far as I can tell, much of banking is about risk, which banks can choose or choose not to take. They may have realized that non-US customers exposed them to increased risk, so they've stopped accepting new ones. I imagine they're under a lot more pressure since they started backing bitcoin businesses, and I joined prior to that. Just fathoming a guess here :)

I'm suggesting this under the assumption that you've blockchain.info allows you to nickname wallets, and that this could be connected to a compromised password linked to a similar email. All very tenuous, but worth thinking about.
For example, if I scoured a compromised database of cracked passwords, I might find that a user signed up under the email kittykat32 used a weak password: "p4ssw0rd"
I might presume that this user frequently uses variations of this weak password, and try to access a blockchain.info wallet nicknamed kittykat32 using a few variations.
Even if this were the case, a strong AND UNIQUE password would thwart this effort, so I think you're fine if that's the case.
Anyhow, these are the sorts of things that might become more common. There wasn't much incentive to target you before, but if there's any suggestion that you're an early-adopter of bitcoin (like a wallet on blockchain.info or a post in then it might be worth the effort for an attacker to cross-check this info.

oh hey, I'm new too. I just make up words when I'm new :)
I just mean that there was this slow gradual decline in buys, up to 197, and then this huge wall of 150 BTC's selling for 200CDN/BTC, then another wall at price of 220CDN.
And honestly, cavirtex just doesn't look proffesional. It looks like it was hacked together over a weekend. The aesthetics don't particularly matter, but I'm cautious that they rushed other parts of their bootstrap too. When a business is operating so close to their limit that they can't put time into design and UX, then they might be doing the same with security and due diligence.
Disclosure: I'm not a designer, but I work with systems integration tools that configure and provision server infrastructure, so I have an admittedly vague but educated sense of how they might be operating in the background.

Thanks for helpfully pointing that out. My understanding was that they both hinged on similar tech principles related to tracking transaction flows, one to offer a higher value for certain units, and one to choose not to deal with unit of a certain lineage. If I'm totally off-base, my bad.
But to claim that taint is mind-meltingly stupid seems unfair. Say that I want to help bring to light those involved in one of the big hacks (say someone steals a bunch from seansoutput). Some could offer a voluntary service like a payment processor, that checks any money I receive for that history, and reports whatever I know about that person. There are many situations where this is bad, and many where it could be good.
Yes, there are ways around any of this, but it's about me as a merchant wanting to make the world a little more a minefield for those who act antisocially according to my particular set of beliefs on what antisocial is. That strikes me as an entirely free-market way of operating: I act as my own autonomous entity, according to the rules I feel are important to a functioning system.
And as for your final analogy, you assume that bitcoin has the exact same draw for everyone. It can be desirable for some reasons, without someone caring too much about the others. That doesn't make their use-cases silly. Someone who just wants a  car for scrap-metal would be bewildered if the seller started berating them. They're operating according to their own set of values, and those make sense in their system of thinking.

Imagining a once-a-term cryptographic voting system is a goal stemminf from your living in a constrained world. Imagine how an electoral system might evolve when there's negligible cost to running an infinite number dynamic and complex referenda. How might you structure a society to ensure maximum participation/engagement and still protect the people from their own wildly-swinging gut reactions, and protecting the minorities from the tyranny of the majority. That's where the thought experiment gets interesting :)
@_date: 2013-04-08 14:15:35
It's because otherwise there would have been no option to buy, as they were at their limit. They communicated poorly, but without it, you presumably would not have had the chance to buy any at all.

Yep, and if the wholesale supplier of BitcoinStore is in any way savvy (as I'm sure that they are), then they'll recognize that the partnership is worth it in the long run, and they'll enter into a new agreement regardless of whether bitcoinstore hits the actual quotas. They've already exercised discretion and optimism in extending it once (when quotas weren't hit), and it's doing much better this quarter.
So given:
- bitcoinstore is admittedly not a money-making endeavour, but a break-even proof-of-concept (as they've acknowledged).
- The wholesale partner is going to recognize the extenuating circumstances and renew the contract regardless.
Then the attacker is just bleeding themselves dry, at no real loss to bitcoinstore, and simply helping them to build up the infrastructure to fend off future attacks. The only one suffering is the wholesaler, who isn't making *as much* in sales this quarter as they otherwise would (ie. the party with no real skin in the game, who really doesn't particularly care one way or the other.)

Apparently there's been a relevant theory floating around for awhile (according to a friend who informed me of the gist when I told them about bitcoin). Basically, if a government makes a very important law, and is then revealed to be powerless to enact it, it will undermine them and they'll fare much worse for wear. I think legislators will be considering this, because there could be far-reaching consequences to bitcoin's attempted banning.
I don't think this has ever really be tested in practice in quite this way, so it's hard to say how it will pan out.

Stuff like this makes me think satoshi was an NSA group. And I guess I'm OK with that, in the big scheme of things. So what -- a big government saw the future and realized this was going to happen anyhow, so they seeded it with plans to keep first 1 million coins until it was established. They've seeded a more equitable system, which will hit equilibrium eventually. The nest egg will eventually be depleted, and we're all better off for it :)

Looks really cool, but I wouldn't recommend anyone donate unless you can prove you're legitimate. Usually people will feel pretty good with trusting you if you cab attach an established identity. There's a service called trust cloud which does a really great job of this -- you basically attach it to your social media sites, and it analyzes your history and gives you a much more general trust score that you can share widely without making your social network accounts open :)

It's funny that the article brings up antifragility as something that Bitcoin doesn't exhibit. Antifragile things benefit from disorder. And if you think about it, couldn't it be argued that Bitcoin, an economic system that breaks down in catastrophic situations, helps create an antifragile society?
To clarify, maybe it's a good thing that economic transactions are discouraged in times of crisis, in favour of more social transactions. If a hurricane rips through a state, might it be better if shopkeepers were implicitly discouraged from carrying on business as usual, and instead interacted on non-monetary terms?
Anyhow, just thinking out loud.

FYI a Keynesian can technically believe in monetary and fiscal management that is *decentralized*, and Bitcoin allows for that. Convince 51% of the nodes that your rule is for the good of the system (stimulus or what have you) , and there you go: monetary policy by consensus.

Imagining a once-a-term cryptographic voting system is a goal stemminf from your living in a constrained world. Imagine how an electoral system might evolve when there's negligible cost to running an infinite number dynamic and complex referenda. How might you structure a society to ensure maximum participation/engagement and still protect the people from their own wildly-swinging gut reactions, and protecting the minorities from the tyranny of the majority. That's where the thought experiment gets interesting :)
@_date: 2013-06-12 13:59:20
It could happen pretty quickly if a political party figured out a system that worked and people responded to that -- a single party could have this style of operation in their platform, and it doesn't break any electoral laws. Should this party win an election, then they have the mandate to implement it wholesale and scale up :)
I think the pirate party is already experimenting with it -- it's called "liquid democracy" or "delegative democracy"

Please ignore this one if you're anti-state and think that the sooner the state is gone, the better. Please don't downvote me if you disagree with the premise, as those who agree with it might want to have a discussion in the open. (Time will tell if the discussion was worth having.)
As someone who believes that some form of stripped down and responsive state can be an expression of the values of a community, I am excited for how Bitcoin might some day force states to be much more responsive and reflective. In a largely bitcoin economy, withholding taxes is easy if you disagree with policy, and there is no way to "shadow tax" citizens by printing more money (and devaluing that currently in circulation). This is well and good in some cases (less funding for war and IP law), but some would say bad when considering other "essential" services that they happen to appreciate (avoiding mentioning anything explicitly so as not to alienate readers).
What happens if the state loses its ability to fund "the good stuff" via shadow taxing before it has had time to adapt it's strategy to become an entity that people *voluntarily* fund?
@_date: 2013-07-03 18:56:55

The guy who runs it is a good guy, so I don't think he's trying to play you. I'm fairly certain it's that he only has a quota for a certain number of API calls because reddit throttles the number that anyone can use. He can't lower it to the point that everyone who *wants* to tip reddit-wide, because that would break the system. I believe he's set the cap so that it's only a feature for supporters of the bot (ie. it's literally a donation, not a fee).
Couple options I can imagine:
1. or someone else asks reddit for an exception for his API key so that he has a much higher quota.
2. If reddit admins can't easily do that, then perhaps can approach the admins and get their blessing to sign up for multiple API keys, and just rotate through them for each request. This would essentially spread the load across multiple API access accounts. I can't imagine this would be a problem if the admins were cool with it.
Anyhow, the bot maintainer seems like a spot-on guys, and I he'd be willing to work through a solution if there were an option.
@_date: 2013-04-18 06:30:15
Probably has something to do with blockchain.info's first DDoS that they've been suffering under for the past few hours:

I'll give you the point on definition of democracy, but that's really beside the point. Yes, compute power wins, and not people power.
And if &gt;51% (compute power) says that a given chain is valid, then it's *valid*, especially if you're working under the assumption that a good proportion more will be goaded into choosing the 51% side. Of course, a hair's-width 51% means less people will be goaded into switching, because it's not a sure thing that they'll "lose out", but if --say-- 70%+ choose the "new" rules, it's much more compelling for other miners to switch quickly. Because every second they mine the "losing" chain, they're losing wealth in lost bitcoin revenue (since the resulting transactions aren't recognized on the "winning" fork). Particularly those who don't have such strong political convictions will adopt the new rules pretty eagerly.


Yes, it will. If over 51% support a rule, they will confirm a higher proportion of the transactions and the blockchain length will be longer. It will fork the blockchain, and miners will need to choose.
(And I wouldn't use "broken" to describe a new set of rules, because it's the protocol that the majority accept. If the majority say "I prefer this", can it really be called broken?)
Would you mind sharing your credentials? If you're a core developer and we still disagree, I would like to understand why. To clarify, I'm an amateur programmer and I've read through about half the bitcoin wiki and understand most of the technical details.

Gyft is free for consumers. The stores pay them for the service of managing a giftcard infrastructure. They work directly and seamlessly with merchants, and so can drive prices lower than a service that manually buys and orders things for you.

I get what you're saying, but someone could still take advantage of our goodwill even if they don't explicitly ask. If someone claims to be working on something, and others get excited, they will send money which tacitly encourages others to.
I'm just suggesting we lay ground-rules for what's expected when you say you're working on something.
So hey, this is useful even if we leave up the "no panhandling" rule. It would still be helpful to officially endorse an expectation of how folks should present and verify anything that they say they're working on, software-wise.

I can try to answer that. Banks are extreme concentrations of power that work with government, and disrupt our political process by exerting undue influence on our elections and legislation. I support bitcoin in the hopes that it will neuter our banking industries.
I'm not anti-government (as I believe a government of the people in its purest form is an expression of our neighbourly love and compassion), but I would like to see it shrink provided that we have new tools to help smaller communities fund public goods and social safety nets. I feel the waste and corruption of government (which I assume is what leads many to lose faith in the merit of taxation) can be ameliorated through transparency and accountability to the citizenry, and cryptography has an important role in those areas as well :)

The customer needs to have a piece of technology to have the private key that authorizes the transaction. There's no sane transaction process without this. Either the customer has the phone with a camera, or they have a usb hardware wallet (these are in the works).

Not to be a downer, but isn't this the sort of partner Bitcoin *doesn't* want to rise with? I mean, morally, I'm with Mega, but it's just such great ammo to create anti-crypto currency legislation. I mean, drugs are also shitty ammo (silk road), but no one is losing money or profit from silk road's existence. But all stops are out if bitcoin is being used to finance something that (at least in their eyes), is costing them untold millions.
Anyhow, I'm not against it, but I'm just not sure I want to root for it, at least not before all these awesome ycombinator startups get off the ground :)

@_date: 2013-04-19 01:32:07
Awesome! But just a heads up -- after the debacle with Bitcoin24, an incorporated company isn't good enough. I'm unsure why you need lawyers to reveal who you are building the thing. People want to see the github accounts of the coders who built the site, and see what sort of chops they have. For instance, is building the [buttercoin trading engine]( and he's put it out there that he was employee  with dropbox, wrote LANSync (dropbox's p2p file sync engine), wrote a quantum cryptography engine, among many other things.
You don't need to all be highly acclaimed, but you need to demonstrate clear competency via public code, especially if your code is hidden and people are to take it on faith that you have the proper experience and/or guidance. And to be clear, what you're doing is not something I would personally feel comfortable/capable of doing, I'll be honest.
Anyhow, I say all this because I want you guys to be more successful that the other exchanges, which might mean being more candid up front, because the internet will find out either way. Toronto, repruhsent and all :)
@_date: 2013-05-16 12:53:57
I think this would only make sense if you have a machine at home that printed bitcoin bills. Which I'd never thought of before, but it's kind of an interesting idea.
But I don't get the impression that the change wallet printing part would ever be part of it... I imagine you'd just have to get fiat change for what you didn't use. Unless there are HUGE changes in how the consumer software/hardware world works. I would only ever recommend trusting a product that did this if everything (hardware/software) was open source. Any proprietary-ness borks the whole thing, and your money is vulnerable indefinitely, unlike traditional systems where a payment system only introduced vulnerability during the transaction. If you can't trust the machine absolutely, then it's a weak link. The money might disappear 2 months later, but after that time that its been in your hands, you'd have absolutely zero means to prove it was that this product was the weak link. It seems silly.
And I out of line on that? Do you still think that any paper wallet created on a third-party product could be trusted? (I'm genuinely inquiring.)
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:18:56

Did some creeping around, and seems there might already be a partial solution in OKPAY:
I signed up for their service, and it seems that when you have money in their system, you can convert between bitcoin and cash reserves. And since their Android wallet app allow the top-up of their debit card with cash, then you could technically hold you money in bitcoin, then transfer to the card for spending fairly easily. It would still require some high fees, but at least makes it possible.
Not option to buy bitcoins with credit card through them however...

Sorry, my point was probably unclear. Merchants are joining for their business reasons, and I'm wondering whether this is a false reason. These merchants are presumably going to be promoting it to other businesses, if they see benefit. And more consumer-minded folks (not saying this is OP) will promote based on their own interests. Should we discourage this?
I'm genuinely not sure what's "good for Bitcoin", so I'm not asking rhetorical questions that I presume to know the answers to. I want only "true believers" to be propping Bitcoin up right now, but I'm not sure whether discouraging other stakeholders is appropriate.

You'd need to convince everyone all over again that it has value, which is a herculean task that I don't think any one person/organization can do without a compelling argument, which I don't think you have yet. Bitcoin took 4 years to get where it is. It's only competitors have purpose, either facilitating mining on desktop workstations (litecoin) or allowing a new structure for domain name registration (namecoin). You need to solve a problem that geeks and those invested feel needs solving, and I don't think you're going to convince the geeks running the show (miners and developers) to reimplement to solve a perceived business problem that they feel will solve itself later (stability).
If we don't have the stability that all stakeholders want at maturity, then this conversation will likely happen again. It's going to be like moving from gold to paper post-great-depression all over again, if it happens. It needs to happen on its own based on consensus, and the bitcoin protocol will be changed or forked accordingly.

Was ready to upvote you until the condescending "Chill out" closer. I'd advise you don't mock your customers for taking security seriously. It's your negligence in not *clarifying* everything in these posts before they were brought up by concerned supporters. "Beta" doesn't mean wild west to everyone (remember gmail's first 5 years), nor does it excuse you from the responsibility to assuage all your customers concerns.
IMHO your role, as the folks dipping your toes into the waters, is to own up, set the record straight, and thank those who put their valuable time into researching the points you left dangling.
All things considered, the service looks interesting. All the best, and I mean that.

Nice! Best of luck in 2016 man :)
I think I have a different view. My assertion would be that change will never happen from the inside, at least not at any appreciable rate. Something needs to swoop in from outside and overtake. The loophole that would allow this is the electoral party system. Of course this would be much more effective with a proportional representation democracy (or something comparable), but most aren't fortunate enough to have that, and it could take forever to arrive in some systems.
Most electoral system changes involve policy and legislative changes. This slows it down and keeps it from being iterative and innovative. The nice trick about liquid democracy via party platform is that it involves a hack on what it traditionally the realm of the politicians sense of judgement. There have never been any rules dictating how this is exercised, so there's literally nothing bureaucratic stopping someone from working this way today.
I see this as literally one of the only way that someone can, within the current systems, iterate on democracy in an unencumbered fashion. You can literally create a sexy platform for democracy that can engage you like an effective web service. Using public key cryptography, you could let card-carrying party members watch CSPAN (or equivalent), and vote on issues on their mobile phones, and the representative would immediately see that reflected on their interface (an ipad they perhaps look at immediately prior to casting their vote).
This is essentially doable, testable, and demonstrable right now -- no changes in law or regulation required -- and I don't think any other potential electoral system improvement can say that :)

The libertarian are going to hate this response, but whatever:


You need to convince 51% of the processing power to play by new rules. The rest will follow as they realize they're on the losing side of popular will. Those who don't will be relegated to a fringe economy where an ever-increasing number of their coins are worthless to those in the majority economy.
If it's obvious that a change is what's required for a functional system, it will happen. It's monetary policy by consensus.

Not irrelevant. A novice coder (like myself) could put out a proof of concept in a few weekends, with no fees except Twilio. Any other system would have high transaction fees which are passed on to consumers.
A bitcoin-backed service would be significantly cheaper to run, the savings of which can be passed to users, and would therefore have a huge advantage

Don't do it. Stay in for the long haul. It might crash, but bitcoin won't go away. You will be soooo bitter.
There's this issue with patient care where people WANT choice in life-or-death situations, but when we study this choice, we see something interesting. Patients who make like-or-death decisions on their own which end poorly, live their lives with terrible regret, and are much worse off. However, people who defer decisions to an authority (the doctor), may be angry if things go poorly, but in the long-term their mental health fares much better.
I'm saying that if you lose all your bitcoin in a market crash that is out of your control, your mental health might be better than if you made the choice to enact a bot that gave away immense amounts of wealth.
Not sure how great the analogy is, but thought I'd share :)

Keep in mind, this is a loaded assumption. Larger block limit might mean perhaps large powerful data centers are required for bitcoin mining. And large data centers are hard to hide from authorities and governments. How does Bitcoin change when it's easy to detect where the work-horses of the system are located? That's the basis for the ability to centrally regulate and control.
Anyhow, food for thought. This is what the off-chain transaction debate revolves around -- whether bitcoin is the platform for microtransactions, or simply the backbone of an ecosystem of other currencies and systems that settle in btc at end-of-day or whatever.

For  What if the wallet, in a transparent way, allowed for a "training" period where it didn't actually get encrypted until the 10th time it had been entered. So tell them to pick a new and strong password, and let them know that they'll have a limited grace period where they can reset it, perhaps displayed with a little progress bar. After this, assuming the user now remembers their new strong password, they'll be prompted to encrypt for added security. Thoughts?

I don't know -- I know that lots of folks/industries need the stability of a slow legislative process to make decisions about the future, but Reddit has honestly given me lots of faith in the ability of communities with agile tools to self-correct and self-reflect. The community makes tons of POOR decisions related to vigilantism and such, but there is reliable backlash and institutional memory. So the mention of "no way to go back and ifx without another referendum" doesn't seem to bad. It's basically a societal "hey, I learned my lesson, let's repeal that bad call". We currently can't do that without laborious processes where politicians are reluctant to lose face, which distorts what we all know to be the sensible solution :)

I would move backwards through the explanation. Start with the usage, so people understand why they're supposed to get excited about what makes it work. Perhaps walk through a transaction, and show that it's verified by the halfway point, then maybe tell someone to set up a mobile wallet as you're talking, use satoshidice to gamble the amount, aand transfer it to them at the end. Also, you could do a shout-out to reddit users, and walk through how the tipbot works, sending them some money (and maybe embarrassing them by reading out a reddit post)
Don't worry so much about the tech (wow, I can't believe I said that). If you're at a tech company, people will dig into that on their own time if you convince them how world changing this will be.

And, just riffing here, but any clever future system will have a tough time replicating the ingeniously fair distribution model of Bitcoin, since obscurity is not an option for a sucessor. A future crypto-currency would do well to seed itself via "porting over" established wealth from Bitcoin prior to a certain point in the block chain, allowing you to claim the new currency based on previous Bitcoin balance -- it's a decent distribution model, and Bitcoin is the only wide-spread currency whose world-wide distribution is essentially open source.

As a reader who honestly doesn't hate americans, I was interpreting the downvotes as directed at your insistence that you and your government are, for the purposes the this e-conversation, the same thing. It's unfair to the dialogue if you insist that a slight against your government is also a slight against yourself. You might see them as inseparably entangled, but depending on the political spectrum that others lay on, they might not.
So your insulting them in return for what is, from their angle, a clarification that is a defence of you as a person -- this might strike them as a bit antisocial and worthy of downvoting. Just saying, there's a misunderstanding here that isn't rooted an anti-Americanism.

So as follows:
- 5 btc/block in transaction fees
- 7 transactions/second max on network (current limit with 1MB blocksize)
- 10 min/block
So for calculations
7\*60\*10 = 4200 transactions/block
15/4200 = 0.00357142857143 btc/transaction
Even at the current 109 USD/btc rate, that's:
$0.40 fee/transaction
So I guess those are the predictions of a fairly knowledgeable guy like friedcat. Of course, the max blocksize might get bumped, so that's a variable. But I assume he's doing that calculation using current assumptions

I'd like to reiterate that "control of bitcoin" happens at the miners and pools, not the exchanges. Miners power the transactions and generation of value in the network -- exchanges just ground that created value in something we can understand better: US dollars.
The exchanges are simply where bitcoins "become real", by turning them into cash. Amazon is just another place where they "become real" by turning them into goods :)

Here's what we need: A moderate security private ATM's for companies and organizations to install on their premises. For example, the Internet Archive has the right idea, but it needs to be smarter:
Essentially my argument is that bitcoin has tons of fans and therefore evangelists, but no simple way to help those evangelists lower the bar for their less evangelical coworkers/tenants/friends. If we can develop an opensource ATM, and someone people start building it on the cheap and selling it, then there will start to be tons of people with small amounts floating around in their mobile app wallets.
EDIT: When I say "moderate" security, I simply mean that it's not being installed in public. Obviously the software and connection to the internet must be secure, but the hardware security is the toughest part, and as long as it's being kept in a "safe" place like an office, that's less of an issue :)

I think you misunderstand how the tech works. It's not like every satellite has just what you need, and you just rent it and it starts working for you. You need your hardware up there. They stated that their network works on a very specific band to filter out. It's entirely reasonable that they need their own hardware to make this work. And launching a new satellite every time their iterate on their idea and specs would be prohibitively expensive for a full-fledged business-model, not to mention a tiny incubator program

FYI, I'm Canadian too, and recently held the same views. I'm starting to realize that certain technological systems might someday replace the system I currently know, with something a little more like libertarians imagine.
Just as a thought experiment, imagine a system along your town's roads, which anonymously tracks when vehicle A is running on the roads. Maybe it does this by having a voluntary emitter in the car of everyone is town, and having receivers on every few telephone poles. There's no identity attached to the emitter, but simply a random token (like a bitcoin address's address) that keeps tracks. As the driver, you can reset this token to a new value whenever you want, so you know that someone managing the road toll system couldn't never track your habits as easily. The city logs the distances travelled for each token, and publishes them every year, so it's simple to crosscheck your tokens and figure out how much you owe. In its simplest form, everyone operates on the honour system and simply pays once a year.
If you wanted to be more suspicious, you could create a system based on trust, where certain trusted community members can technically see when you haven't paid. If participation in this web-of-trust system was incentivized (tax breaks for connecting your identity to at least 10 fellow citizens), then you could easily make social pressure be the impetus for paying taxes. If I'm paying for my roads, but I can see that two of my friends are settling up, then I'm going to be on their case.
That all may sound totally out-there, but that system above could pretty easily exist today. The technology for it is already invented and fairly cheap. Larry Page, Google's cofounder, actually kinda touched on this in his recent conference speech. He lamented the fact that we need to carve out spaces where we can experiment with the laws and governance models that we currently surround ourselves with.
Oh my god. Such a rant. No worries if you don't read the whole thing. It was a fun exercise for me anyhow :)
@_date: 2013-04-08 21:39:24
Thoughts? 
@_date: 2013-05-28 17:40:00
I'm not disagreeing that it's odd how things are. You're saying "should", and I'm simply saying "is". There are some valid reasons for the backwardness you're pointing out.
For instance, the startups are flashy in places where there's money to be made -- the clients and the protocol itself are all volunteer efforts, so the model is a bit different. The startups might start funding more "core" development if they find their profits are being knee-capped by the slower pace of the volunteer communities :)


The core protocol of bitcoin isn't ready to scale. Maybe startups see this as the beta period where they iron out the kinks. Maybe they're ok with the ecosystem turning some people off this early. After all, the protocol literally cannot handle the scale of every moderately technical person on the planet leaping into bitcoin. It's not ready, so many working at startups and on core are likely glad to see that folks such as yourself (*not* deriding you there) are frustrated and leave for now. I'm not saying the clients are intentionally clunky, but it sure is helpful in creating a healthy growth strategy, considering the maturity of the ecosystem and protocol.

Not so, say those in support of local economies. It's not always a good thing that the whole world is tied up into one highly entangled ball of financial matters. I don't think it's a given that a fork will always be bad, but then again, I'm entirely open to being convinced otherwise
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:26:40
Bitcoin doesn't need investors in the currency. It's need investors in the technology, and that's what its getting. It needs people to say "Hey, I can start working on a weekend project that allows me to accept money for free."
I'm "investing" right now. I'm building an ATM that will allow people at my office to feed bills into a machine, hold their phone up, and have bitcoin transferred to their phone. And I'm giving the hardware and software specs away for free to anyone else who wants to build an ATM for their office. Investing is happening, and it has absolutely nothing to do with speculation on the currency price. If someone else is investing in a site that allows them to buy computer parts for bitcoin, then that's the other side of things.
Thanks for humouring me with the conversation btw :)

@_date: 2013-04-22 23:24:48
Not really. It would only be ironic if this wasn't the completely expected way it were going to evolve. The protocol is a simple tool -- a spec that value-added services were always intended to build on. Those value-added services can become decentralized as people figure out interesting ways to do so, but only if the weaknesses of centralization incentivize it.
Anyhow, not trying to be contrary, but I'm just saying that there's no irony in this, any more than there's irony in the decentralized BitTorrent protocol needing websites to catalogue torrents. :)
@_date: 2013-04-23 21:04:06
To clarify, blocks are the means by which all other transactions are verified, so they're critical to the network regardless.

I think it's worth thinking about the endpoint here. If lost opportunity in destroyed ecological services continues to be an externality in the energy business, then bitcoin will take full advantage of that and people will very truthfully be converting finite natural resources into money. But if we make efforts to factor in the value of clean energy and discourae dirty energy through appropriate channels, then we will have more responsible forms of energy and there's less need to feel guilty over it going toward bitcoin mining -- it will simply be competing with other uses of that energy on a even and fair playing field.

i think it's that every transaction needs to be sent to every node on the planet and stored somewhere, consuming bandwidth while getting there. A $0.50 transaction must be stored on every node in the network, in every blockchain. I think the fee is meant to discourage that, right?

Well, the community is diverse and largely non-technical, and I'm sure many don't realize that it can't scale as fast as their enthusiasm. The theoretical max for transactions right now is about 7/second, which is not that great. But boosting the limits mean that mining becomes a more fringe activity that requires greater infrastructure. And greater infrastructure essentially means less decentralization (since the little guys are pushed out), and perhaps even easier oversight. Because hey, what government wouldn't notice if a whole datacenter was required to run a bitcoin node :)
Anyhow, the community is still sorting this stuff out. Some people even suggest that they don't *want* bitcoin to scale, and would rather see an off-chain transaction system develop for the everyday transactions, with bitcoin forming the backbone of the larger system:
So yeah, lots of contention! Scaling is not just technological, but political
@_date: 2013-05-31 16:13:57
It is effectively a democracy. The longest chain eventually wins, and that is what 51% gives you -- the longest chain. Those in the minority would find themselves in the awkward position that they're building a shorter chain fork that will likely be worthless to the majority of the network (designated by computing power), becoming even more worthless as *others* jump ship to the new set of rules.
