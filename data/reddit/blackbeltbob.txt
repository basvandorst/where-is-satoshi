Miners can sign their block with a message. Some BIPs (bitcoin improvement proposals) require that a certain percentage of blocks are signed with that message. That message can mean anything, and in case of SegWit, it signalled the miner's readiness to adopt SegWit.

SegWit is a collection of fixes to the bitcoin protocol of which usage in transaction is promoted to encourage bitcoin scaling. It is not a fix to to overhead costs, and was never designed for it. The Lightning Network is.
I feel that this post heavily rests on confirmation bias. Bitcoin has massive hurdles to pass yet, most prominent of which are scaling (many orders of magnitudes) and government interference. As time progresses the latter will become less likely, and several solutions have been postulated for the former. This does not mean that those problems have been fixed, just that a general roadmap is in the works to overcome them.

You mean "validate transactions into blocks faster than bitcoin", because a bitcoin transaction is known to most/all nodes within 5 seconds of publication.
Validating that transaction, provided it has the correct fee, *in a system that is running as intended* should not be an issue.

SegWit was a collection of well-tested fixes for flaws in the bitcoin protocol. Nothing more. It's just a bit of code. The whole concept that somebody can be 'against' SegWit is just plain stupid, and the fact that they decided to fork off before SegWit was enabled showed their ulterior motive: to remain able to use ASICBoost.

**What are the benefits of SegWit?**
The most obvious benefit is a slight capacity increase. The elimination of unwanted transaction malleability is an important one. This was more of a nuisance bug as opposed to a critical bug. Other benefits include:
* Weighting data based on how it affects node performance
Signature covers value
* Linear scaling of sighash operations
* Increased security for multisig
* More efficient almost-full-node security
* Script versioning

@_date: 2017-02-01 16:14:38
That would set a bad precedent, which would lead to mistrust. Would you invest heavily in an emerging cryptocurrency if changes to the system could activate unintentionally? What if the change had been made elsewhere, in a part of the code that could be exploited? It is not a problem that the minority would be left behind, so long as the minority should actually be left behind. If things are committed without exhaustive testing, and are then released, things can get out of hand.
That said, this technical problem is not a problem specifically true for BU. BU is just one of the players on the field. What if a bug in the Core client has been released two years ago, and a malicious person finds out he can transfer bitcoin to his personal address? The chain would not object, he would be in the majority. Who knows if this is not already the case?
No team should consider themselves the know-all-end-all savants of the entire bitcoin community. That is unhealthy.

@_date: 2017-02-01 15:59:53
I think the main problem comes from a (perceived?) reduced technical know-how, calm, and belligerence compared to the Bitcoin Core team. Personally, I don't much mind BU being there, and wish them the best of luck. Even better, if a third party were to enter the market, and all three teams had a roughly even size of the market, that would be very good for the Bitcoin community and ecosystem.
Bitcoin United seems to be judged mostly by a number of controversial opinions, and the recent failed block (due to a technical issue that should have been caught before the software was released) feeds the critics. Bitcoin United has a number of very vocal, very opinionated supporters. This further increases (or: has led to) people mistrusting the Bitcoin United team.
Had Bitcoin United's market share been that of Bitcoin Core, then the recent technical issue might have been disastrous to the bitcoin community. It would have exposed a very real issue: that Bitcoin is being run by a relatively small group of people that could (inadvertently and without malicious intent) cause bitcoin investments to lose value. This could reduce bitcoin's value, which is in the end what everything is about.

Roger Ver is one of the early adopters, with an estimated wallet of 600.000 BTC. In his past, he was involved with dealing in explosives without a licence. He is currently one of the main driving forces behind Bitcoin Unlimited, which aims to give miners the ability to choose blocksize. This requires a hard fork, something perceived to be very dangerous by all involved. They are also actively resisting the adoption of SegWit. Bitcoin Unlimited has been involved in slandering, trolling, and name-calling in the bitcoin community, which has as a result *seemingly* split between Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Unlimited.

Thank you for this great translation. I feel it greatly shows us the mindset of Jihan Wu, and his reasoning behind attempting to block SegWit.
Unfortunately for him, the market will not be held back by individuals. He will find to his distress that other initiatives will be proposed to force SegWit through. Second layer networks will be deployed, even if he continues his holy war. 
In the end, it will only sow distrust and enmity between miners (even those taking no side, or SegWits) and users.

No, the arguments for and against increasing the block size, and Core's position on the matter (increase via SegWit, via SF) was not theirs. The entire discussion soon escalated into name-calling, finger-pointing, and much drama. That is why most of them are anti-Core.

The value of gold doesn't change because it is an established commodity with a clear, even supply and demand. Bitcoin is not established yet, and thus experiences a continually decreasing volatility.

Profit-drive people make all of their decisions based on the sole premise that every decision leads to an increase in return **for them**. In and of itself, that is not a problem. It becomes a problem when they only focus on short-term gain, and not long-term gain. That leads to decisions that are harmful to the ecosystem but profitable to them. Increasing fee cost is not a problem for miners, but are harmful to the adoption of bitcoin in the long run.
It is this short-term money-grabbing that has led to the current problems that the financial world is in. A "benevolent" party that delivers open-source software that is mathematically proven to be beneficial to the ecosystem is trustworthy enough to allow a consensus within the ecosystem to adopt their software. It is not the other way around: them forcing software down our throats.

No, you will never be able to find a hard drive with bitcoin on them, for the simple reason that a bitcoin is never stored on a hard drive. It exists in the blockchain.
That said, it *is* possible that you find a hard drive that contains a wallet file on it. Wallets contain the private keys used to manage bitcoin addresses. It is possible that those addresses still contain forgotten or abandoned bitcoins and if the wallet is unlocked, or can be unlocked by a password, then you can manage those bitcoins.

SegWit has been extensively tested and is mathematically proven to work. It can't *not-work*. SegWit is a combination of a number of hotfixes that provide malleability fixes, a variable blocksize increase with a cap, and provides a playing ground that allows more functionality to be built on top of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-15 08:53:51
It means that a couple of fixes and features are added to the protocol. Some of those fixes are required for LN to operate easily, which is the scaling solution of the longer term. 
SegWit has bifurcated our community due to politicking and name-calling. With the hard forked bitcoin cash (BCH) and adoption of SegWit hopefully comes a more unified community and a new impulse to innovation within bitcoin.

Hi Roger, thanks for replying to my comment. A lot of people made pretty toxic replies to your post, but I wanted to take the time to reply in a more moderate tone.
You say you wanted to test out the current level of censorship on but in doing so, your post leaves something to be desired. All your original post amounts to is a quote by Satoshi. No context. No personal insights. No contemporary topics which would require or even warrant such a post. Just the quote by Satoshi.
If I were to go to a christian sub and quote a random verse, such as 






which [ironically was the first hit on a quick google search I did just now]( would that post really have any substance? Would any of the people on that sub appreciate the post? Would it further discussion or lead to new insights?
I feel that most of the schism between and is due to the inability of a lot of people (not constrained to bitcoin) to differentiate between censorship and moderation. Compounding that fact is that moderation is done by actual human beings, who are possibly incorrect in their own assumptions.
Being moderated is not a bad thing, and the choice of where to draw the line is difficult, because options differ. 
I invite you to take a step back for a moment, and reconsider your opinion about censorship and moderation in *and for the allegations of undue bannings are made in both subs. Can you honestly tell me that you perceive censorship in only one of the subs, and not in another?
There has been a frenzy of name-calling, finger-pointing, and spit-balling in both subs. Trolls are going to troll, no matter what happens, but perhaps it is not too late to do the right thing and extend an olive branch to each other. Maybe if the perceived leaders of both subs can get along a bit better, the whole community will.

There was an agreement made by a number of large players in the bitcoin ecosystem. This agreement (NYA) meant activation of segwit, and adoption of a hard fork to a max blocksize of 2Mb, with the option to softfork later to 8Mb.
Those not present at the agreement (most of the bitcoin users and several other big fishes) feel that the Hard Fork, which is to be scheduled three months after SegWit activation, is both forced, unnecessary, and dangerously rushed. They fear that the hard fork will not be adequately protected from replay attacks and will lead to uncertainty.
BitPay was acquired by BitMain, one of the most vocal proponents of the 2x hardfork, and the main antagonist against SegWit. It appears that they are trying to push the hardfork code upon users *without their explicit knowledge*.

opt-in replay protection is a poor alternative to opt-out replay protection. Remember, most of the users don't know replay attacks are even possible, and that not protecting your transaction can lead to loss of funds on another chain. Using opt-out replay protection means even new users can use the system.
It took a long time for the developers of Bitcoin s2x to even add the replay protection, which was not planned from the start. They felt that Core should add the protection, since in their opinion s2x was the real bitcoin and core were laggards that didn't want to change. They skip over the fact that they are hard-forking away from the current consensus, and then claim that it is the original chain that has to implement the replay protection. That alone shows an attitude that his both harmful to the original chain (which a large portion of the ecosystem appears to adhere to), and which displays a lack of understanding of the technology behind bitcoin.

BCH can indeed have its own consensus rules. In fact, they are *required*, because if they had the same ones as Bitcoin, they would *be* bitcoin.
What OP is trying to say is that adding the emergency difficulty readjustment asymmetrically and using the same PoW algorithm causes miners to switch to BCH when the difficulty swings violently down. This is not competition; it is negatively disrupting (and not the management book disruption-in-established-markets style which is positive) both the original chain, and the hard-forked BCH chain.

The risk with the 2x part of Segwit2x is that it can possibly double the load of the blockchain on full nodes. This change will raise the requirements of a full node, which is dangerous, because we want as many people to run a full node as possible (except for Craig Wright, who is an loudmouthed asshat anyways) to keep the network decentralized.
I'm going to divinate that in three months, the 2x part of the NY agreement will not be pushed, because SegWit makes it economically unfeasible to attack the mem pool with large size, small cost transactions. The need to increase to 2mb will be gone.

Bitcoin is elegant. But it is also p2p, which is the most optimised structure in terms of privacy and shared trust, but the least in terms of efficiency. Without a second layer, and coupled with the exponential growth in use of Bitcoin, the operational cost of a full node will grow beyond what most users can afford. If so, there will be node centralisation, which is bad. 
By adding a second layer, you allow the existence of a system with reduced trust, but based on the full security of Bitcoin.

The big blockers didn't like the implementation Core chose, which led to increased dissatisfaction.

Block size limiting was not intended because of Moore's law in desktop computing. Unfortunately, new computers aren't fitted with double size hard drives and CPU speeds for quite a while (more than 2 years). Could it be possible that Satoshi wrote the white paper assuming trends from that time, and that changes in the past few years have made some parts of the white paper obsolete?
That said, I will also not follow a chain that invokes the original vision of Satoshi, or treats the white paper as a definitive tome of knowledge. I will follow the chain based on mathematical proof.

The main advantage of Lighting Network is the possibility of using the existing bitcoin protocol as a layer 1 foundation to formalize the *summary* of the transactions in the LN. If you go to a coffeeshop regularly, and spend 100 dollars on coffee each month spread out over multiple days, this could move ~those 30 transactions each month from the blockchain to a single summary of you paying 100 dollars worth in bitcoin to the blockchain. It would allow more throughput in the bitcoin ecosystem.
Possible disadvantages could be that multiple Lighting Networks rise in popularity, and that two actors are on either of the networks, making LN impossible *between them*.

Bitcoin is, at the moment, by far the largest player on the cryptocurrency playing field. A large number of the other players are either scams, have obscure use cases, or have not added value other than sounding like bitcoin. Of the few viable alternatives, many are still in their infancy, promoting some cool new ideas, but encumbered by their early infancy.
Bitcoin's two unique selling points in terms of cryptocurrency which were established at its founding was a peer-to-peer trustless electronic cash protocol, combined with a pseudononymous transparent mutability-proof ledger. These innovations are both still relevant and solve problems we face today (fractional reserve banking combined with central banking, and quantative easing combined with fiat currency). 
The major hurdle Bitcoin will have to take is remaining a mutable-proof ledger, but with every passing day, and every increase in global hashing power, this problem becomes smaller. Miner centralization and scaling are short term problems that will need to be solved, but as BIP-148 taught us, the power is still with the users, not the miners, and so I feel that these hurdles can be overcome.
New cryptocurrencies might dethrone Bitcoin, but I don't envisage Bitcoin as the only global payment system. I expect three or four contenders for the throne, creating a healthy environment.

You are asking for a quantitative number, but that does not exist, in the same way that you can't state a qualitative number of the intrinsic value of a dollar, or a euro. We have conversion rates to and from other fiat or precious metals, and we can say: "I can buy two pieces of bread with a dollar", but all that is not quantitative enough, as the value of those items also varies.
The problem with Howard Marks's statement is that he does not look at bitcoin outside his own domain; he looks at bitcoin as an investor, and does not evaluate the currency beyond that.
If he were to look at bitcoin from the perspective of a webshop owner (who no longer has to worry about credit card payments being revoked by the customer after sending his or her product), a programmer in Burkina Faso (who takes up orders for work online and no longer has to worry about international bank transfers and money exchanges), or even Timmy across the street (who wants to be in control of his own money after his dad went bankrupt because his father's bank went bankrupt after a bank run), the intrinsic value of Bitcoin becomes clear. The book "Mastering Bitcoin" by Andreas Antonopoulos has a number of good use cases in its early chapters that show the benefits of Bitcoin over other, traditional currencies.
Also: MOON. ;)

You make an initial transaction with anyone you regularly have transactions with that you don't *need* published onto the blockchain. Say a coffeeshop. Once the transaction is in place, you can pay small amounts of Bitcoin for an agreed upon time and an agreed upon Bitcoin limit. 
Once either limit is reached, or either party feels compelled to, either party can publish the transaction and it will be mined. 
The interesting effect is that if your neighbor visits the same shop, you can pay him without needing a transaction with him. You pay the shop, then the shop pays him/her. 
You can also chain together more than just two lighting node users; and this could potentially reduce the amount of transactions that are published onto the blockchain immensely.

Ponzi schemes are different from Pyramid schemes in that investors know they are required to attract new investors to increase the value of their part in the scheme. Because of this, a pyramid scheme tends to exists far shorter than a Ponzi, because of the massive influx of new investors required to keep the pyramid viable. 
If bitcoin is a ponzi, then we are all unaware that our investment is the sole addition of value to the investment. This would mean that blockchain technology, the use of virtual money, and the ease of use of bitcoin for people in developing countries is not worth anything. 
The use of virtual money is definitely of value, if only because of its ease-of-use compared to banknotes and centrally-managed digital currency. Blockchain tech has proven itself versatile and robust. People in developing countries (and a number of countries that are in oppressive regimes) are using bitcoin as a medium of exchange with lower volatility or higher value than their own currency. 
I believe Bitcoin is neither a ponzi or a pyramid scheme, but then, why would I be here.

After the fork, I continue using breadwallet as always. It functions just the same way as it always did. I get a number of transactions done, and am still very happy.
Meanwhile, the Segwit2x branch starts gaining traction, and because of either a higher hash rate or cosmic chance, their chain becomes longer than the one I'm currently on. 
Breadwallet automatically switches. Those transactions I did a couple hours ago are suddenly gone. I'm left, scratching my head.

Consider this: a quick google search learns that Satoshi owns about 1.000.000 BTC. At 1000 $ per bitcoin, that amounts to 1B $. If he were to cash out all his bitcoin for dollars, his value would be greater than the GDP of St. Kitts and Nevis. If the price goes up further, to something like 10K per bitcoin, it would be the GDP of Namibia. At 100K per bitcoin, he would enter G20 easily. Note that I am speaking of *an individual human being* entering a list of the 20 most powerful *industries*.
The value of bitcoin is largely dependent on the value of other commodities and currencies. If the dollar weakens, then BTC rises in value expressed in dollars, but remains stable in regards to gold or Euros. Another very important note is that dollars, euros and other currencies are themselves ways of expressing value (Goods and Services). 
What is the roof? That depends on what currency you compare it to, and the general financial stability of the economic systems in the world. If another Lehmann Brothers fiasco hits the stock exchanges, one could easily see investors flock towards BTC and subsequently hiking its value in dollar up. Perhaps we hit peak oil, which will raise the value of goods and services, making Bitcoins more valuable. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 08:17:53
Agreed, my reply is not clear in this regard. LN allows you to make one initial transaction to "fund" your balance on the LN with the other party. Once it is in place, you can move that balance to and from the other user, until either party wants out. Then, a single transaction on the blockchain closes the transaction. Moving the balance is done by transactions on the LN which are secure, and not published onto the blockchain. This could scale bitcoin to billions of transactions.

No, it is a block size increase signed by *a number of the biggest players in the bitcoin ecosystem*. All in all, only 40'ish signatures are on it, several of which were companies in the same corporate structure. Several other players did not sign, or *weren't even invited*.
SegWit2x needs to be backed by an economic supermajority for it to function as the new valid chain with consensus. The question is: do the signatures of those 40'ish companies represent the economic supermajority? Most agree that they do not.

Imagine a hard fork occurring, and you have BTC and BTU. All transactions up to the forking block are present in both chains.
If you spend BTU-coins from a transaction in a pre-fork block, an attacker could post the transaction on the BTC-chain, where it is also valid. In this case, the funds would be wired on both chains, even though you transmitted a BTU-chain transaction.

A common argument against bitcoin is that a bitcoin "has no backing". There is no 'cost' to a bitcoin, in the sense that they are generated during mining and given by the protocol as a reward. The reasoning is that, because there is nothing backing a bitcoin, it has no value.
This line of thinking is strictly wrong, and it is almost trivial to point out why. Mining is not a free lunch. A miner spends large amounts of money on a mining rig if he or she wishes to be competitive. The cost of the rig and the electricity it consumes are what dictate the value backing a bitcoin (sans any other value attributed to the coin via other reasons).

Not necessarily true - if money flows from the altcoins to BTC because of the split and the free b2x tokens, the total market could grow beyond what it would have been without the split.

500tx/s would serve about 70 large cities. It would allow a whole country to use bitcoin as it is being used today. Bitcoin's goal is global adoption. If so, we need to be able to scale much further. 
Considering this, we can deduce that increasing the block size doesn't scale enough. We need to increase the number of transactions per block, and we need to reduce the total number of transactions on-chain. The lightning network allows us to remove all but two transactions between actors doing regular transactions. We sacrifice a modicum of trustlessness in order to post only a starting transaction and an ending transaction.

At every 2016th block, the protocol looks at the time it has taken to mine those 2016 blocks. If that time, divided by 2016 is smaller than 600 seconds, the difficulty is adjusted upwards proportionally to make finding blocks more difficult. If that time is lower than 600 seconds, it is relaxed.

That said, I see a common thread running through all the comments and replies in this topic. It appears (in my humble opinion) that you want a blocksize increase due to: 
* longer confirmation times.
* higher fees.
Increasing the blocksize would lead to an immediate reduction of both, and none of the people here are objecting to this. Looking past the immediate future, both of your objections would return. I feel that most of the friction in this thread is based on how long it would take, and at what cost. You feel the cost is low, and the fix will speed the network up for a while.
That also said, please note that increasing the fee of your transaction will speed the confirmation time significantly. Also: as long as miners are mining empty blocks "because the system allows it", congestion will be an issue.

Your post won't be censored, as I've seen numerous posts just like it. New users asking what the drama is all about. Old users giving their opinions. The perceived censorship on is really not as much an issue as some would have you believe. 
That said, I think makes an excellent post describing why a fork would be contentious, and it is worth replying to. 
The proposed 2mb blocksize increase is part of SegWit. It's not an immediate increase, and will likely only effectively increase the blocksize to 1.7mb, but it is a blocksize increase none the less. Politics, name-calling, and twitter fits have made it into a drama, and all of that is (presumably, there is no hard evidence for this) a smokescreen to prevent disabling of covert ASICboost in mining (which 'the largest miner' is naturally not happy with).

When you make a bitcoin transaction, it is added to a pool of unconfirmed transactions. Miners take these transactions and 'mine' them, which means adding them to the blockchain in a new, topmost block (of a maximum size of 1mb). Bitcoin's resistance against manipulation and double spends comes from this system called *proof of work*.
Some time ago, someone suddenly added vast amounts of transactions to the pool of unconfirmed transactions, each of them rewarding the miners with a hefty fee for including them in blocks. This means other transactions with regular fees are suddenly disincentivized because there are more profitable transactions to include in the blocks.
This all leads to an attack which has been more-or-less ongoing for the past year. Transactions are added, people don't see their own transaction included in blocks, people increase the fee on their transaction, people on forums bitch and moan about block sizes. 
Best to just hold any transactions you have for a while, if possible, and wait for the storm to die down.

I think Satoshi chose 10 minutes because it is a human-friendly figure, which also has a near-human-friendly figure for 2 week intervals (2016). He could have done 12 minutes (1680), or 8 minutes (2520). There are alt-coins that have smaller block-times, such as monero (i believe), so it is an implementation-detail.

Betamax was competed out during its adoption phase. I imagine Bitcoin becoming betamaxed if s2x turns out to become "the bitcoin". s2x would then be VHS. 
The point of my post was not to illustrate successful things and then comparing them to bitcoin, it was to illustrate things that were widely adopted and "the standard" in their heyday, and which were discarded when superior options were made available. I'm trying to point out that things generally don't fail because it is too big, too powerful (or something inherent to itself), but that it fails because it falls short compared to something else. 
VHS was cheaper, and that eventually competed out Betamax. Streaming media is easier and more usable than cumbersome disks. Feudalism only serves the top of the pyramid, not those below, who are in a majority.

In 2040, each block will be worth 0.20 btc in coinbase reward. By that time, fees should have taken over a major part of the mining industry's reward.
If miners decide to leave bitcoin for more fertile grounds, then the difficulty will scale back down and perhaps GPU mining will be effective again. Or we can change the PoW algorithm to something that can't easily be ASIC'ed.

If everyone stopped mining, no new blocks would be added to the blockchain. Assuming that usage remains unchanged for some reason, the mempool would overflow, because the miners are the ones validating our transactions onto the public ledger (the blockchain). Bitcoin would either:
1. Rapidly lose value as its main reason for existence no longer functions.
2. Experience a rise in people mining with GPU's and individual mining gear, as the difficulty would readjust after the 2016 block interval passes. If so, bitcoin would go on. 
Note: in situation 2, I'm assuming for a moment that all mining pools stop, meaning no more large-scale ASIC mining farms.

nothing. Your wallet is just a collection of private keys. These keys are required to generate public keys that will hold some balance of bitcoin, and to spend those bitcoins if you feel like it.
When the fork happens, if the developers were to take an exact copy of the current protocol and only increase the block size, a second chain will continue to exist that is only valid for those users. It will contain all transactions leading up to the split, and the transactions on their chain, after the split.
Sounds good, but problems will soon arise; what if you spend some of your pre-fork bitcoin in one fork, but not the other? Your transaction will reveal how to unlock your funds, and people on the other chain can create a transaction sending money to their own address without your consent. This is called a [replay attack]( Most of the criticism about the fork is due to the unwillingness of the s2x camp to add a replay attack protection (which is trivially easy to implement btw.)
There is also the case where the original fork grows faster than the new fork. If enough Proof-of-Work is delivered, the other chain could be wiped out (reorged). As such, the change to a larger block size is not as trivial as 'increasing a number here and there', but should be well thought out in advance. 
edit: You will be able to access the new coins if your wallet supports them. If it doesn't, then you can either move to another wallet that does support the both coins, or wait for support to be added, if ever.

S2X miners will mine a block with a block weight &gt;4000 at a specific height, marking the start of the S2X chain. 0.15.x nodes will not accept those blocks and are actively dropping connections with btc1 nodes. BTC1 nodes however want those connections to find 0.14.x nodes, which don't actively drop the connections. The connection is sought after because of the transactions they propagate. Completely disconnecting the btc1 nodes from the 0.x nodes would sever the btc1 nodes from the original chain, and would cost them all of the transactions of people that don't upgrade their software or aren't paying attention.

If 90% of the hash power leaves, the original chain will retain 10%, and blocks will be found once every 100 minutes. Full nodes don't mine, and even if they did, they are no match to the hashing power of the larger mining pools.
The real question will be: will 90% actually leave, or will it be more nuanced. The miners signalling NYA are signalling *intent* to mine Segwit2x, but are not bound by anything to do so. If they actually do mine SegWit2x, they can choose to do so with only a percentage of their total hashing power.
The BitcoinCash emergency difficulty adjustments taught us that miners will mine whatever is in their best interest. If users remain using the original chain, then the miners will return to mining there. We might be in for some oscillations in hash power, but in the end, the chain with the highest adoption in users will win out.

doesn't need to define valid. The presence of the economic majority defines valid in bitcoin. If everyone felt that a hardfork with a 2x block size increase in mid-november was a good idea, then valid would be Segwit2x, and the original chain would be abandoned. If everyone rejects Segwit2x, then the original chain would define valid as 1Mb blocks, and Segwit2x would not be valid.
In reality, some percentage of the users will join SegWit2x, and some percentage will remain with the original chain. If the percentage remaining at the original chain is relevant (ie. &gt;20%) then mining the original chain will have value, and both chains will be valid, with the note that SegWit2x will probably be *called* Bitcoin, and the original chain something like Bitcoin Classic.

Whenever the miners have mined a new block, it is relayed to the entire network. That network consists of all miners, full nodes, and other systems using Bitcoin.
A full node checks the validity of each block, making sure there are no double spends and the rules of Bitcoin are not violated. If that is the case, it rejects the block.
There has been some commotion about full nodes. A number of malicious actors in Bitcoin, like Craig Wright, are saying full nodes aren't important, and that miners are enough to validate blocks. This argument is false though, as miners could team up and do a 51% attack, where they agree to allow blocks that aren't compatible with the Bitcoin protocol, such as rewards of 100 Btc for each mined block. Full nodes protect us from that.
This is also one of the reasons why the block size debate has split out community so: larger blocks reduce fees and increase capacity, but also increase the requirements for full nodes. This could lead to reduced amounts of full nodes, which endangers the network's security.

One of the key differences between this and Ethereum's turing complete scripting is that bitcoin will support some form of smart contracts, they are not nearly as complicated as the smart contracts eth makes possible. This is an intended feature; bitcoin does not want to support full turing complete scripting, because that might allow for scripts to become so complex that unintended behaviour might occur in them. Keeping the scripting as simple as possible allows for bitcoin to function in a secure way. If one wants full turing-complete scripting in bitcoin smart contracts, one needs to check RSK (Rootstock).

* What happens when hashrate begins in favor of one, then moves back to the other?
* What happens if Xapo announces X wins, and Y overtakes after that announcement?
* What happens if another fork is announced where 90% of the hash rate decides to stop the halvening and extend bitcoin to 500.000.000 coins?
I'm not trying to be snarky, but these are all use cases that can happen. Xapo's decision to follow the chain with the most accumulated difficulty is vague and deserves further explanation.

Are you daft? I know everyone on this sub, and each member of the community as a whole is convinced of all the merits and benefits that Bitcoin offer. Many of us have studied the technological and social intricacies of Bitcoin, and have deep knowledge in those fields relating to Bitcoin.
But not owning bitcoins is *certainly* not a financial risk. Fiat money is still the most-traded, most-deeply embedded and widely-used financial system, and all the technological wonders that Bitcoin is cannot change the fact that anyone can at any time convert from fiat to Bitcoin and back. 
Bitcoin is currently booming, and yes, *investing* in Bitcoin now could yield high returns later on. This is speculating but it does not have any implication on financial risk. If I have a million dollars and trade them to bitcoin four years from now, it will still have the same value on that day, but in another currency. I will not be at risk. I will only risk possible future returns had I traded today and not spent the coins.

"Opening a channel through a third party" is what Lightning Networks will mean. You relinquish a bit of trustlessness to open a channel with someone else (Bob). That channel remains open, but can be used to make multiple payments. You can also pay others (like Dave), if a route can be found from you to Dave via other people connecting you and that other person (Bob and Charley). 
Of course, you can always just use the bitcoin layer for that payment, if you don't mind paying a fee for that single transaction and/or if need more trustlessness.

Well put! B2X is a fork, much like the (soft)fork to SegWit was a fork. That none of the miners decided to continue mining the original chain is irrelevant, as they could have. The only differences are that S2X will be backwards incompatible, and that it is not carried with equal consensus among users. 
If users keep using no2x coin, it *will* keep getting mined, and retains (some/most of) its value. Both chains will be valid bitcoin chains according to their own interpretations of the consensus rules.

Segwit does not remove power from the miners. I'm assuming you are rehashing the old "Lightning Network will move all transactions to a company-run sidechain" argument, but that is flawed, because the lightning network can only function with multisig transactions anchored to the blockchain. It also doesn't prevent you from setting up your own LN and trying to gain enough momentum to get it adopted by the users.

Technologically: no, I don't believe they are. BU really only wants a blocksize increase, and this is possible. It is a hard fork though, and many users are very wary of hard forks. Segwit is a soft fork, which also increases the maximum number of transactions.

No. Bitmain wants to increase the size of each block to 2mb. This is a single change that allows exactly 2x the current amount of transactions in a block.
Segwit does not increase the hard block size limit. It is a change that allows certain information about transactions to be moved out of the block into a SEGgregated WITness. This allows for more transactions to be put into the same 1mb block we have always been using. This is however only possible with addresses that have been created after segwit has gone live, which means that the blocksize increase will only take effect slowly, and will accumulate over time. I believe a 2.7Mb increase is possible, but everyone expects it to be somewhere around 2mb.
More notably, SegWit also disallows the use of covert ASICboost. This is a "trick" that allows miners to get ahead of others that don't use it, but which is harmful to the mining ecosystem. It is believed that blocking SegWit is mostly done due to this reason.

Publication of scientific discoveries is actually a pretty good way of ensuring trust among scholars. The findings can be checked by redoing the experiment (otherwise there is no science) and if the results cannot be duplicated, a new paper appears to disprove the former. Trust is built by systemically providing high quality publications. This is the foundation of the academic model that has worked so well over the past millennia.
Citing one or more publications about a topic is enough to consider the results in those publications about the topic as fact.

It is secure. Nobody said the transactions are not secure. But if a soft fork does happen, and your wallet is going to be spending coins on a fork that gets reorg'ed, your transactions after the fork will be undone.

Wasn't the whole point of doing SegWit as a soft fork that people don't need to update the software because doing it as a soft fork means being backwards compatible?

Refuting the case that Proof of Work is not the law in bitcoin by referencing the Bitcoin Paper is a logical fallacy. The appeal to authority, without furthering any explanation. 
That said, and without getting into any political finger-pointing; do you not agree that "the law of bitcoin", which I am interpreting as "the rules of bitcoin", is actually the protocol itself, and that miners are bound to that protocol? The change to activate SegWit or BigBlocks is really a rules change that would change the protocol, changing the laws of bitcoin. In that sense, proof of work is indeed only used for double spend protection. 
We are currently using proof of work for signalling, and that has become political because signalling readiness for SegWit or BigBlocks has been made into political choices. But ultimately, for Bitcoin's current implementation, Proof of Work is solely a double spend protection.

Leaving bitcoin on the exchange is a very poor idea, and you are rightly uncomfortable with that. 
Ledger Nano S and KeepKey are both relatively new products that appeared with high media profile. both products are currently in production, and will be available in june/july. Trezor is a similar product that has been around longest and is the trend-setter. 
I concur with that keeping a small amount of bitcoin in a wallet on your phone is handy. For android, you can use Breadwallet, Mycelium, or Samourai Wallet.

A UASF node rejects blocks that are not signalling SegWit (bit 1) when August 1st arrives. If a large enough group of nodes keeps rejecting non-segwit signalling blocks, and a significant portion of the miners are creating SegWit signalling blocks, then that chain will keep growing. If at any point, that chain becomes longer than the non-segwit signalling chain, then the non-segwit signalling chain is re-orged away, destroying their blocks and the profit of all miners that have mined in that chain.
UASF node count has gradually grown, and is a way for users of Bitcoin to force miners's hands *if user support is big enough*. If all miners signalling BIP-91 actually enforce it, then this problem is mitigated, because it will be economically unfeasible to produce non-segwit signalling blocks (because 80%+ of the miners are also rejecting those blocks).

The graph that was used amounts to a torus of perfectly interconnected nodes. Every node is connected to four other nodes, making routing much easier. 
If LN really opens up the market adoption for bitcoin, and companies like Netflix and Amazon allow users to connect to their service for pay-per-second viewing of content, I could however imagine the network to become much less perfectly connected. I could imagine the eventual network would contain far more cliques, and far less obvious routes from any node to any other node.
Assuming all users will want to pay any user in the network is also unrealistic. I could imagine that certain nodes will eventually become "spend" nodes, customers that use their LN contract to spend money on goods and services of "buy nodes", companies.

I'm pretty sure you are neither a troll or a shill. You are not getting paid for advocating an opinion you don't share, nor are you deliberately trying to be obnoxious. 
I do however take a bit of offence in how polarized the discussion has become due to finger-pointing people, and due to the unwillingness to discuss solutions in both this sub and It's easy to lose perspective and attack the person instead of the idea, and I've caught myself preaching instead of discussing quite a few times. 
In my opinion, if you look at SegWit without putting on coloured glasses and without possible hidden agenda's, you see a collection of small fixes and changes that each improve the bitcoin ecosystem. Looking at the hard facts without worrying about alterior motives makes it abundantly clear that SegWit is a good change.
As usual, it is politics that is keeping us from innovation.

correct. But if users remain on the bip148 chain, then a miner somewhere is going to see it as a business opportunity, and will mine that chain. If so, the network remains at risk of reorg. If the bip148 grows, more miners will be tempted, and the economic pressure increases.

Bitcoin is having trouble scaling well. A number of options are available to scale beyond the current capacity. Segregated Witness (SegWit) is one of those options, and most of the community agrees that it is both beneficial and preferable. Emergent Consensus is (EC) another option, but far more contested because it gives miners more control over blocksize, which could harm decentralization.
Miners signal readiness for future changes to the bitcoin protocol. 41.6% is signalling readiness for SegWit, 41.5% is signalling readiness for EC.  Note that miners can signal both at the same time, so theoretically, there could be 41.5% for both, with a single small mining pool signalling only SegWit.
Also note that these are only miners signalling. This excludes users running a full node. Support for SegWit is far greater among non-miners than among miners.

@_date: 2017-06-12 08:47:39
Increasing the blocksize to 2MB will:
1. Be a hard fork, which is dangerous.
2. Increase the requirements for running a full node.
Because Core wants to minimize risk and make running a full node available to anyone, they dislike these two points, and advocate running the soft fork SegWit, which is lower risk and does not increase hardware requirements for full nodes.
If SegWit does not mitigate problems with transaction backlog and high fees, and the lightning network does not solve them either, increasing the block size will still be possible. Core is not against HF to 2mb by default, they just feel that its cost is too high *at the moment*, while other options are also available which have lower cost.
That said, I think the decision to go for SegWit first, then HF is more a political agreement than a technical one.
edit: don't forget that most of the bitcoin ecosystem is ready for SegWit. It is not (yet) ready for a hardfork to 2mb.

To my knowledge, the dot com bubble mainly existed because companies were willing to spend vast amounts of money to update their software and hardware by overpriced and uninformed consultants. They would hire a firm for a five-digit number, that would write a five page rapport analyzing their IT infrastructure, giving some global advices like "moar interwebs" and "buy this router that I get 20% provision on which you don't actually need". The market became saturated with them, after which many companies decided they'd spent enough, and hired people with actual knowledge in the field to do it.
Crypto is in the early stage of adoption. I'm working at a tech company with 7 other programmers. Only one can explain how bitcoin works, and he happens to be an early adopter/hodler. The others, many of which are math alumni, don't. It goes to show how little known bitcoin currently is technically, and lots of the advice by knowledgeable people is actually not technically well founded.

the problem stems from "value" being defined in terms of other objects. You can only speak of value by comparing something to something else. And because everything is subject to supply and demand, "value" automatically fluctuates.

Yes, but because value doesn't magically appear, both chains will be worth considerably less. If we assume both chains have a 50/50 chance of survival, then expect the value of your coins on both chains to be worth half of what they were. If one chain becomes more relevant because mining remains centralized on one of them, then expect the value of the coins in the other chain to decrease. Eventually, one chain survives and most, if not all value ends up  there. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 11:51:02
The date was chosen because SegWit has a date of November 15th. UASF signalling from August 1st would give the community and miners the timeframe to make well founded decisions between Aug 1 and Nov 15.

You are comparing the increase of adoption to a system that has matured and is accepted by the general public for decades. You are misrepresenting the fact that Bitcoin is still in its infancy, that adoption *is* increasing. 
You also speak of the Bitcoin chain delay. I'm assuming you mean "time until a transaction can be assumed immutable". This is actually just a few seconds in most use cases. Visa has a 30-day option of reverting a transaction because of various reasons, and businesses have to deal with the fact that they might ship a product to a customer that might not have payed for it, even if Visa tells them they *currently* have. I would refer you to the bitcoin book, 2nd edition:


Waiting for an hour to get a couple of confirmations on a transaction of bigger value is not a problem.

Commonly, the argument is that we want to see what happens to the capacity once segwit is released and blocks steadily grow to include more transactions. If LN makes it to the scene rapidly, and gains wide adoption fast, a blocksize increase is not required, and should be avoided. 
Unfortunately, that scenario will probably not happen, as wide adoption of LN will probably not happen in a timeframe that prevents another backlog as we are currently experiencing.

Gold has an intrinsic value because it is a rare metal. I believe that all the gold in circulation in the world amounts to two Olympic size swimming pools. Scarcity of a product creates value, if demand for that product is high. This is basic economics.
You are comparing bitcoin to money (lets say: 10 dollar bills), and saying that bitcoin does not have the same backing to gold as a 10 dollar bill has. This comparison is flawed due to several reasons.
1. Bitcoin is not the 10 dollar bill, but the gold backing the 10 dollar bill. Because it is purely virtual money, it does not require a representative in the real world, even though this is theoretically possible (paper wallets). In fact, paper wallets are superior to bank notes, as they directly reference the digital gold backing it.
2. That 10 dollar bill is not backed by gold. This is known as fiat money. Currently, all countries in the world are working with fiat money, because it allows for much more spending of money. There are numerous documentaries on this subject. I recommend looking into it because it is a very interesting and scary world.
3. Bitcoin has a finite volume. Somewhere around 2100, the last bits of bitcoin will be mined, after which no further bitcoin will enter the bitcoin ecosystem. This has the benefit of allowing bitcoin to create value for itself by becoming more and more scarce as demand increases. 
Good question though, and one which is fundamental to the entire system of Bitcoin.

They say that for each big discovery. Remember, lots of people though SHA-1 was safe. Turns out that it isn't. SHA-256 is a lot safer (2^256 vs 2^61) but with good application of maths and further increases in parallel computing, we might be able to break it. 
Obviously, this would have far-reaching implications. Breaking SHA-256 would upend most of the security on the internet. It is probably easier to hack the blockchain.info database and try to log into listed accounts using a list of common passwords.

Developers indeed prefer SegWit, because SegWit is a combination of a number of improvements on the Bitcoin Protocol. Some of these improvements are Malleability Fixes, others solve Quadratic Signature hashing, and obviously there is a capacity increase. [Check this link.](
Miners are opposed because SegWit will disable covert ASICBoost (google it), and because some of them are trying to steer bitcoin into a direction where they have more control and more influence.


A decision will be made one way or another. If all non-miner full nodes decided to enforce that all blocks must signal SegWit readiness, then miners not signalling SegWit will risk mining blocks that will be rejected by an economic majority of the network. This in turn means their energy and hardware investments are at risk, effectively forcing their hand. This is known as a User Activated Soft Fork (UASF). BIP-148 is intended to do just this; enforce signalling readiness for SegWit from Aug 1st. If SegWit is signaled by +95% of the mined blocks for two weeks, SegWit activates. 
This is risky, which any fork always is.

There is Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. A good example of a hard fork that caused a chain split.


Proponents of a higher block size limit often cite Moore's Law. "Hard drives will continue to increase in size with the block chain". It is true that Satoshi mentions this in the bitcoin white paper, but one has to note that this was during a time when Moore's Law was still a truth. It is not any longer. We will arrive at a moment when further increases in capacity will not be able to keep up with the blockchain. Did you solely buy a 5K iMac because of the pixels? Or was your machine replaced because of other reasons, and the 7x increase in pixels was a benefit you got regardless? If your machine did not need to be replaced, there is no reason to do so just because of technological progress.


~~If~~When SegWit is adopted, and Lightning Network solutions are created, then there will be operators of those side-chains. They will indeed be big players in the field, but won't centralise Bitcoin. Consider them like exchanges; they provide a Quality-Of-Life service, and are rewarded slightly for it. But exchanges are not a requirement to get into bitcoin. You can always find someone in real life and offer them money for their bitcoins. It's just a lot easier to do so through an exchange, especially if you don't know the person you are buying from.
Also note that the Lightning Network solution currently under development by Core is open source. You can start one yourself if you feel entrepreneurial.


This is a common mistake. What is being flagged is not readiness for SegWit, but support for SegWit. Consider that the Bitcoin Core client is SegWit ready. If SegWit was adopted right now, then 83.92% of the nodes would be able to handle them just because Bitcoin Core does. Wallets, exchanges, etc: most nodes have implemented SegWit and can work with SegWit once it is implemented.
So what does flagging for SegWit mean? It means that that specific miner/mining pool wants segwit to activate. The reason it is only at 30% is because a number of large mining pools (bitmain for example) don't want SegWit to activate because it disables "Covert AsicBoost" which gives them an edge over other pools not using AsicBoost.
