Yeah we are only really exposed to the winners, kind of like how "oldies" music is all great because they're just playing the hits from the era. One thing that I think is interesting is when you watch old videos from like the 40s and 50s, some of the brands you see in those videos still exist today. It's actually quite impressive to see the longevity of some companies.

I doubt that they are owned by Vanguard, it's just that the Vanguard VTI total index fund has proven to be low risk and have reliable growth over the years, so it's very popular. It's an easy and safe investment. Bitcoin is neither easy nor safe (to the common person).

I'm generally pretty slow to invest into things I don't understand. Once I learned more about BTC and understood it better, I felt confident to invest into it, so I did. I am not foreign to the concept of hodling onto my investments, as, like stated, I've held onto certain parts of my investments for over a decade. I've seen what it's like to hold through stormy waters and times of no movement, and I've also seen what it's like to hold onto an investment for so long. At least in the world of the stock market, compounding interest is an amazing thing.
For sure, Bitcoin is still very speculative, but I am confident in the technology behind it. Will it work out nicely for me? I have no idea, but I'm not opposed to holding on for another 10 years to find out. At the end of the day, I have my other investments to fall back onto, but for now, even if BTC reaches 0, it's exciting to be taking part in a brand new way of how the economy works. And hey, if it hits 100k+, I won't be sad, that's for sure.

* There was a hard fork of Bitcoin, the fork is called Bitcoin Cash.
* There is a contingency headed by a guy named Roger Ver whose goal right now is to make Bitcoin Cash more popular than Bitcoin.
* To achieve their goal, the contingency is performing acts that confuse people such as buying bitcoin.com and taking control over the subreddit * People opposed to the Bitcoin Cash contingency started to call Bitcoin Cash Bcash.

I find for the most part there's no real benefit to telling people about your investments. If you advise someone to invest in something and it goes down, it's your fault, and if it goes up, they think they're a genius for investing in it. Basically a lose lose situation.

The reason why hates bcash so much doesn't really have too much to do with the altcoin itself. The hatred stems mainly from the fact that the leader of bcash, Roger Ver, is trying to commandeer the Bitcoin name. He owns bitcoin dot com, the bitcoin twitter handle, and is actively trying to confuse people into thinking that bcash "is the real bitcoin". If it wasn't such a blatant act of misdirection, Bitcoin and bcash would get along just fine.
@_date: 2019-03-16 06:45:06
That's one of the reasons why I find bcash a failed coin. All they talk about is how much Bitcoin sucks and how Lightning doesn't work. No real content surrounding bcash.

I was a TSLA bull for a while but that time has passed. Like xtal said, TSLA is now a train wreck. All the big manufacturers are bringing their electric cars online and TSLA won’t be able to compete. I have friends in the industry and internally TSLA is not having a good time. Their quality control is also terrible. My friend has a model X and it has panel gaps the width of your thumb on one side and the width of your pinky on the other side. Not acceptable for a $130,000 car.

I generally don't talk about money/finances with my friends because people are inherently jealous of others doing better than them. I only talk about cryptos with a small subset of my friends who are also into cryptos. Telling friends "I told you so", while it feels good in the moment, is a quick way to gain resentment and lose friends. That being said, must've felt real good, cuz fuck the haters.

Bitcoin's name is Bitcoin. Bitcoin's name is not Bitcoin Core. There is no distinction to be made. If you call Bitcoin "Bitcoin Core" it most likely means you've been bought out by the Bcash brigade.

It's annoying that the people running/supporting/promoting Bitcoin Cash have dubbed it Bitcoin Core in order to further fuzz the truth.

No, an ongoing problem with Bitcoin Cash supporters. Shapeshift is partnering with bitcoin.com which is owned by Roger Ver. It is clear that he influenced Shapeshift to start calling Bitcoin "Bitcoin Core". Basically at the end of the day, people are sick of Roger's shit.

But they're not banning buying Bitcoin, they're just banning buying Bitcoin with credit cards. I really don't see what's wrong with that. Credit is credit, it's money you don't have. You shouldn't be buying volatile, speculative, expensive things on credit.
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:58:36

One of the reasons why people think Bitcoin will reach over $100k per Bitcoin is because many think that Bitcoin is digital gold. If you look at gold's market cap, it is \~$7 trillion USD. If Bitcoin were to hit the $7 trillion USD market cap of gold, it would make each Bitcoin worth over $300,000 USD, and that is not accounting for lost coins.
