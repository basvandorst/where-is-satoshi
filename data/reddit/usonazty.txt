Do they have time in Florida to hunt bitcoin entrepreneurs in between shooting black people?
@_date: 2014-02-07 20:44:21
doesn't the item being sold have to legally be a currency, which, correct me if i'm wrong, bitcoin isn't?

obfuscation is just as much a tool as is the law itself.
@_date: 2014-04-30 15:31:01
at least you got it.
@_date: 2014-02-07 19:56:53
well, you've made quite a few assumptions there.  all of them wrong.  i don't have any libertarian ideal, nor am i a drug dealer.  also not sure what the libertarian philosophy as you call it has to do with anything.  all i asked was what would be suspicious about accepting cash and you said everything except what would be suspicious about accepting cash.  i would suggest you leave your straw man approach to discussion behind.  if you feel like answering, the question again was what would be suspicious about accepting cash?

I just jizzed.
@_date: 2014-05-19 02:52:20
for instance, lets say i had a balance of 55.55 in armory.  after closing and opening armory, i now have a balance of 55.055.

i agree that cash is risky, for the person buying.  as a person selling, why would you care?  check is certainly better if you feel you need added protection if you're going to be robbed, but it that isn't a concern, i don't see why if you had the cash on hand you would go through all the extra effort of getting a check.  in fact the arrest doesn't even mention that the cash was the problem.  it says that it was due it it being a "business in currency", which is odd since bitcoin isn't even legally a currency (correct me if i'm wrong).

Why are they supporting drug dealers and child pornographers?
@_date: 2014-02-07 19:58:01
and that's why it's ok in florida to shoot them.

i bought 100 coins for 350 per.  
maybe he wants to realize a profit rather than risk it.
gotta sell them eventually.

Just evidence they have no idea who their market is.  I really don't think Mrs. Jackson on 123 Suburban Street is going to be shopping on OpenBazaar anytime soon, even with the swanky new name change.

that's what i'm thinking.  but's it's really late, so maybe they're leaving it till the morning? 
@_date: 2014-05-19 02:38:11
i'll need something public for that...
and whoever left the other comment is shadowbanned :(

getting it back is the hard part.  being able to watch someone spend your coins as they please does little.
@_date: 2014-02-07 20:22:26
feel free to educate us.

In an America where marijuana is classified as as dangerous as heroin, i think appealing to the better judgement of elected officials is being more than just a little naive.

Surfs up, brah.
@_date: 2014-02-07 19:32:08
why would he suspect anything if people paid in cash?  is that not legal tender anymore?  do you ask for id when you sell something on kijiji?  i don't.  why would i?
@_date: 2014-02-07 21:03:38
every sting operation is by definition entrapment.  getting a court to go along with you is another ball game.

update:  rescan did the trick :)
@_date: 2014-04-29 03:46:01
Why would they believe me though?  I don't want to go there and have them call the cops on me.
@_date: 2014-05-07 04:51:10
Beta vs VHS.
@_date: 2014-05-19 02:59:38

i'll try a rescan and rebuild first.

sound like you have to have a master in electrical engineering just to get the thing running...

guess that means germany is on the nsa terror watch list.
