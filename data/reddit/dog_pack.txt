How about why 4 weeks after i logged a support case can i still not withdraw my cash?

The problem is i signed up to cash out, its getting my money out of them thats the problem..

I would stay away from then just for the fact that after a week they have still not managed to validate my account so i can withdraw cash...

I have done on twitter and on their suport desk. I opend my case on the 15th of october only time they have contacted me was when i emailed their redit person and they update my case with we are looking into it and will get back to you that was over a week ago. No one there will help or talk to you, the phone number does not work when calling from the uk. They now have not one but two lots of my cash as i sold bitcoin with them on the 10th then sent the 5 euros to setup my bank account for withdrals. But ever time i try it just tells me to vervie my bank account. They have my cash now they wont talk to me or give it to me. Feels like a scam to me.

That worked needs the 001 the 2nd number, and i avtually got threw to some one stright away.  Who said they would send me out a link to start a support case on a diff system that goes to the payment people. But lets see if i get any where.

Not happening no email an hour later andc2nd person i spoke to said they had no idea what i was on about, my case was with a specialist who i could not talk to and thst i was just going to have to wait, back to being a scheme..

Might be worth a shot.

They are holding on to my cash and wont give it to me why wont they give it to me? So they need it so they have it on papper but they dont actually have it? Are they having to wait for other people to buy bitcoins with them and send them cash so they can send it out? Approving my bank account should be an automated thing i sent them cash using the unique code they sent me. They now know its my account its up to me if i want to withdraw go it. But still weeks later they wont let me, why whats the hold up. If they need more staff higher them. But nothing i want to do should involve people and if they have time to update my help case with things like we are looking into it. Surely they have enought time to tick ghe box to let me make withdrawals. Yet still i can not make them, why does their phone number not work?
