Chloe Zeng, but probably part of same scam.

Similar. A domestic brokerage account can utilize Futures trading. No reason to use a foreign brokerage firm, unless you intend to lose your money. The scammer I chatted with was adamant about signing up with GoldenDay. Many other guys have fallen prey to this scam.

One guy lost $50K. Many scammers will not take money unless it is a large sum, knowing a small amount is a shit test. So, they pass the small amount shit test, and then they will show a profit, to let you feel comfortable with your investment, in hopes of a larger deposit, then it disappears.

Really need guys to contact HK police, I did not lose any money, so they did not investigate seriously. After a while I started asking what would a model with money want with a 60 year old man.  If you want me to send you photos, send me you email address

Actually, I arrived in the Philippines last week, met this nurse who I had been texting, and, so far, so good. She has not asked for one Peso, and is very attractive, feminine, and very kindhearted.  It is weird that I keep expecting her to go full biatch mode, ala the American feminazi, but, in the 5 days I have been with her, it seems the biatch setting is inactive. 
Wish I had checked this place out years ago. In some ways, it reminds me of how things used to be in America in 1950's and 1960's.  Smartphones are making their impact.
Been single for last 6 years, and at 60 years old, I wasn't getting interest from women less heavy than me.  Here in Philippines, I feel like a rock star.  There were a pile of scammers, yes, but also some nice girls. I think I found a good one.

She told me repeatedly that she made $300K on futures. I replied that I had a brokerage account that could trade in futures and derivatives. She said she got this inside advice with Goldenday and that I needed to open an account with GDKmp. I contacted Hong Kong Police about her activities, but because I didn't lose money, they didn't seem interested

Still have WeChat dialog and photos. Not sure how to copy and paste to Reddit.  The reason I bothered to post my encountered was because it wasn't immediately obvious she was trying to scam me. But, after a while, she seemed to bring up signing up an account and had the PDF file at the ready to get me to sign up. The form looked suspicious, wanting bank account numbers and Passport information..

She told me she made $300K USD. I told her she could make money, I was looking for a relationship.

I am not sending money. The website does look legit,  but there isn't an email link on the website.

Yes I am new to online dating on the foreign sites. I usually get asked what my occupation is, that sort of thing, but haven't had Bitcoin investing come up in that genre.

I haven't had a long game scam played on me. I am new to online dating, so was blown away at all of the scams going on.
