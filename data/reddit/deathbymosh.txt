Outputs per day is a better indicator of overall economic activity on the Bitcoin blockchain than transactions per day. Since one transaction can include multiple outputs, the number of total outputs is more important than the number of transactions themselves. Large players in the Bitcoin space use batching--the process of including multiple outputs in a given transaction--to reduce their overall transaction fees. Therefore, looking at only transactions misses an important part of the picture. So, we've created outputs.today to track Bitcoin outputs.

The premium that Chinese investors pay is a direct result of the limited OTC coin supply caused by government regulations. For more sophisticated traders, there’s an arbitrage opportunity: Traders will buy cryptocurrencies cheaply on foreign exchanges and immediately sell on domestic OTC platforms at a higher price. But there are risks, including price volatility, slow transaction times and China’s strict control on capital outflows.

As the Bitcoin price dips below $10k there is an obvious tension and nervousness in the air. However, it’s at times like these that it might be better to look away from the charts and focus on all the amazingly positive news that has been announced over the first month of 2018.
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:35:29
Yes, I can agree.  The utility of something (early FB for example) explodes in growth first and then the stock price follows it up.  Do you think 2018 can be a tipping point year regarding MASS adoption as opposed to say just...huge adoption steps for the next few years?

The first sentence in response was by far the most important.  Blockchain technology will change the world.  EVERY major corporation, bank and government will use blockchain technology to improve their business models over the next decade, and they will have Bitcoin to thank for its innovation and it open-source code.  Bitcoin is the not only the future of money, but its blockchain tech is the future of technology.﻿

The platform Coinfinity is already known to be the first company in Austria that operates with cryptocurrency platforms. On 1 February 2018, they have brought to the digital system a new technology that is supposed to change the way Bitcoins are traded.

I'm not opposed to crypto. I just asked the question, not saying solutions aren't being developed. But I don't think total energy (wattage) is correct unless also account for relative demand in overall tracking of transactions.

What are your thoughts on regulation? won't cryptos essentially become like stocks and have to submit quarterly reports etc? I'm not so sure regulation will be a good thing

Cryptocurrencies plunged on Friday, with several of the largest falling by more than 20 percent and bitcoin sliding below $8,000 and headed for its worst week since 2013, as worries about a regulatory clampdown globally sent investors scrambling to sell.

Dozens of entrepreneurs, made newly wealthy by blockchain and cryptocurrencies, are heading en masse to Puerto Rico this winter. They are selling their homes and cars in California and establishing residency on the Caribbean island in hopes of avoiding what they see as onerous state and federal taxes on their growing fortunes, some of which now reach into the billions of dollars.
