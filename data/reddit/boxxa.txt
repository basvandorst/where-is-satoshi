First public post but curious on the thoughts and reality of such a thing in this recent Bitfinex hack event.
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:50:12
Difficulty isn't an on and off thing where not mining the last day would adjust the difficulty that much. It is based on the time it took to create the last 2016 blocks and the deviation from block target. This is mostly just multipools switching around for profitability that we now see as a higher factor for SHA256 miners since when the difficulty goes up, they would go to another coin and when the difficulty resets, they find it more profitable since the reward is much less.

They have been insolvent for a while. The rumor is they traded with BTC and lost a bunch in the recent moves and now can not pay out. Your best bet is to buy DOGE or other coins that are on there and transfer those out as others have been doing and resulted in the recent price increases for other coins.

How does a change to the rules in the protocol that causes a fork not be an alternative coin/chain? What do you draw the line at for an "altcoin" if we were to break this into block changes such as rewards instead of sizes? Anything that is not implemented into the core is an altcoin. 
@_date: 2015-12-31 01:08:59
Not sure. It all depends what people can sell into. I know doge and Uno were the two that a lot of people were trying to traffic BTC through to get it out of Cryptsy. 
@_date: 2015-12-31 14:45:50
Yikes. I know a lot of people have multipools linked there that got screwed as well with coins they can't move out. 
@_date: 2015-06-16 23:41:49
I've actually tweeted this idea a while back. MagicTux was on point with dynamic block size. Using the same time frame as difficulty recalculation would make perfect sense and prevent any manipulation just as difficulty and would allow the growth with the network and as the demand needed reducing the need for multiple forks which will be damaging as the adoption increases. 
@_date: 2015-12-07 17:28:16
Yes. I think it was the fact it turned into a troll ground of promoting BitcoinXT which once it was launched as a fork of Bitcoin it is essentially an altcoin and no longer part of the BIP100/101 discussion.

@_date: 2014-05-12 19:37:31
Part of this I agree with and part I think you are missing.
Agree: There is a huge base in the digital gaming to expand Bitcoin but this is only just changing the usability of digital coins and moving away from the centralized platforms such as Facebook credits and allowing a currency to be used everywhere. Valid and helpful but doesn't address a large scale currency revolution.
Disagree: Business adoption is key. Yes, I am sick of seeing posts of the local small hipster shops taking BTC but the large businesses that take it is key to its survival. Right now, paying with BTC involves converting fiat to BTC to buy something and then the business converting it back. As more businesses accept BTC and increase the longevity of holding BTC through the supply chain, the better the coin can make its way into niche markets such as games and used.

Taxes are easier than you think. You are still moving a good so if you sell a 12 dollar meal, the price will be adjusted in the current price of BTC when paid. You still note the 12 dollar sale on sales tax and on your books. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 02:48:31
If they do regulate Bitcoin, it will be treated like other assets. Holding it and using it would probably not be taxed until you go to fiat. For example, if you are selling similar to Overstock and converting BTC payments to cash, that is going to be taxed. Mining and transacting in pure BTC is currently planned to be left alone for the time being if you are not converting it to cash which is perfectly fine. People freak out for no reason.  
@_date: 2014-02-06 03:11:55
Try anything you can do to cash out.
@_date: 2014-07-07 14:53:39
Basically sign up for Bitpay or Coinbase. I have traveled a lot to see both in action and the ability to convert to fiat quickly helps the adoption and you not having to charge a fee or extra if you convert it. You get sent bitcoin based on the current price so you can structure your model after this. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 20:58:01
I would think the 25k in money transfers flagged you. Banks report any transactions in the US over 10k so if you were moving serious money around in a short period of time even if it wasn't more than 10k, that 3 month window is a serious flag.

@_date: 2014-01-13 03:47:02
Coinbase support sucks. I have spent a lot of money with them over the year and their support model is horrible. Once you get setup, the buying is easy and never had a problem but for a company that has such a footprint, you would think they would be able to help users with their fees they charge. They are turning into the Paypal of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-02 19:16:54
I mine and buy bitcoin to hold anticipating it will be worth more in the future. I prefer not to spend it on anything until it at least breaks the $1000 mark as that would be the next milestone to hold above now that we have seen the $400-600 area now. I don't really care what the price is and don't buy it to spend it.

How does this case matter for the Bitcoin/crypto as a whole? He allegedly operated a highly illegal market place and has had multiple conversations leaked of potential hit contracts he bought.

We will see the same impact we saw in the NY market in general. Companies left this state due to the regulations and the government.

If you are looking for short term gains, yes, you lost the quick surge and might want to wait. If you believe in the function of Bitcoin and its use in the future, stockpiling it a small amount at a time regardless of price is always good. I have a scheduled buy every week of .5 BTC no matter what the price. I was scooping it up at 400 and was also at 800. I don't look to sell it tho unless some emergency that requires me to. I look to hold it and use it in the future for everything.
@_date: 2014-02-21 17:31:37
I like this. Thank you for the info. So the worry is that the payouts are the problem when sending money that can get robbed from a website?
I think we are OK then and just need to modify our payout system in the future to use batch transactions. We don't send that many payments so this was not too big of concern for us. 
We see an incoming transaction to our site and mark the transaction id we see in the network pending. When we see the same transaction in a block, we mark it as confirmed as this is a low volume site so orphaned blocks won't kill us. As long as we expand the check to include the next 5 blocks to verify the transaction is still in the block and wasn't orphaned, we are safe to credit the user?
@_date: 2014-09-08 18:56:56
You are looking at a too narrow timeline. Remember when smartphones were just used by geeks? Who needed the Internet on their phone!? Now everyone has more technology in their pocket. As generations phase out and young generations move up, there will be a change over the next 5 years. I stopped investing as hard and just accumulating via day trading but there will be a future of using crypto. There will also be lot of windows to buy in. We aren't going to bed one night and waking up to $10,000 bitcoins
There is a lot of hurdles to still leap. We do not have a consumer friendly system yet but we are making progress. I still think bitcoin is the long term hold for wealth vs the US dollar. No sign the government is slowing down spending and with the eastern world moving away from the dollar, every day your bank account is worth less and less. 
@_date: 2014-04-01 20:34:23
Wouldn't the person who ordered the item see it was paid by someone's PayPal and be able to discover their personal information? This sounds risky with the chance of identifying the middle man and also being able to get the BTC and contacting the company to change the order since technically, you can prove you paid for it and didn't get it. 
@_date: 2014-12-12 16:26:31
Still a sad part is that people are hearing all these news stories and gaining interest but most of the world has no idea how to buy Bitcoin which makes the barrier high to get new money into Bitcoin. This is one of the biggest steps to go ahead. Coinbase does make it semi easy in the US but it is expensive and a little ahead of the basic newcomer.

The plan is the block reward will decrease as transaction fees increase as the currency matures. Also, as the block reward goes down, the cost to enter mining will also decrease so there will be a number of factors that will keep mining alive.

Ya it isn't horrible with the info but still, not the best for a company that is pioneering the ease of use of Bitcoin and trying to be security focused.

Agreed. Everyone posts lines that they think mean something. Bitcoin and cryptos in general have multiple factors that no one has a way to measure. There is trends and everyone thinks they are an expert. Your best bet is to watch MACD indicators. They tell when trade book is trending one way or another. Outside of that, you are playing a guessing game. This isn't the stock market or country currencies. This is social trading essentially.

While I agree with 99% of what you said, I think there will always be the monopolistic view of mine farms and hardware. ASICs entered the BTC field when the investment and profitability was there. As algos change and new ones appear, there will be the investment in technology to own those markets as well. SCRYPT was off the map and while it was possible to mine with ASIC chips, there was no investment until recently when we see the spawn of new currencies. If BTC and other markets shift to SCRYPT-N, then we will see the similar trend when the profitability is there for companies to invest in large rigs and hardware that is dedicated to perform the algos needed and rule out the general consumer grade hardware such as GPUs. 
A true battle would be a random switching algo that would reduce profitability in one large rig. A coin that can switch per block would be the only real way to combat this growth and hopefully push the investment/profit margin so high it wouldn't be useful until again, the reward was there to do so.

It isn't the worst idea but another issue is mempools are not flushing out when blocks are found. Some pools mine small transactions and could really prevent this and still generate a demand to be included and build up unconfirmed transactions.

I am assuming you mean the discussions around the Ethereum BTC Relay so that is below. If not, then I just wasted a few minutes. 
Basically, the inherent problem with things like ETH is that to use it, you need to obtain Eth, typically by buying BTC, going to an exchange, buying Eth, transferring that out, and then going into a contract. A relay is one of the ways that is attempted to be solved. When you send BTC to a relay address, someone can earn fees by relaying ETH to the attached contract removing the need to go to an exchange and buy coins and making it easier to bridge a smart contract with Bitcoin.

It’s not bringing any good attention. Stop saying this crap. It’s not a decentralized currency and is run by a company looking to circumvent banks and learn peoples spending. It will cause a negative look on crypto as a whole if Facebook keeps being shady and ruins this as most general people will associate it all as the same and not know the functional differences why this is not crypto.

Pay for anonymity. Also fees was why these originally closed down and became less popular so maybe we will see that again.
@_date: 2019-12-19 15:11:28
The idea is the network is busy enough that miner rewards will be replaced by transaction fees. With the low volume, fees are only about 3% of the reward but as the network grows, it should have a flip.

How can a user verify a file is legit? Opening attached files is a quick way to get a local wallet attacked since most people check email from the same computer where they keep their bitcoins and would be a ripe vector to start to send malware to take coins. It is a cool idea but any way to implement a file signature that it is a valid file from your site versus malware to help protect users? You would just need to hash of the generated file for the user to exist centrally and then can help provide that second layer.

Banks are allowed to choose who they do business with. They can block any crypto transaction they want. 
@_date: 2019-04-25 18:21:57
I guess skewed would be more of a word. It’s not a like for like comparison as the network has changed, fees are lower, etc. If the network was the same then this would be more accurate representation of growth but all we are really seeing is the network being used more which could be related to outside factors than price.
You also need to take in account that when price is surging and setting new highs, people go more into hold and won’t spend their coins as they will be worth more the next day. We have hit a sideways trend so now people can use the network and obtain coins later without worrying about them being drastically different in value.

@_date: 2019-04-25 16:56:41
This maybe a bit padded. It’s cheaper to move bitcoin now than at $20k and with the advances of lightning, the network is more able to handle smaller transactions than it was back then resulting in more use.

With limited supply the price to buy up every bitcoin as you mentioned gets exponentially high. One person or organization deciding to invest a large amount will slowly trail their orders in such as iceberg orders over time and the price will slowly increase.
The only centralization issues are online wallets (Coinbase/Circle), Exchanges, and mining pools. As the use grows, more bitcoin will get spread out between various companies but mining pools will still reign king at directing bitcoin.

This. Most people have no idea what ETFs are. 
@_date: 2016-02-17 15:36:43
Blocks are not only mined but accepted through the network. If you have a limit of 10 minutes and an easy algo, it is very likely that you will get a lot of orphans since the work is small and it then comes down to building the smallest blocks to get them through the network as fast as possible.

KYC is so broad in the US. Government letting it go would mean a huge loss in “tax revenue” due to lack of monitoring and less government control of money flow. Won’t ever happen.

Yep. People have been in it a while, you need to think of the market gains from it. It was rare someone held from the early CPU mining days to $20k. The jumps to $1 and then $10 was a massive surge from the $0.03 and $0.10 entries. Need to think of it in the massive jumps as you said.

Wall Street booming leaves little worry about peoples financial well being. When the market starts to tank, the US people will look into other sources but everything in the US is against Bitcoin right now with the USD being strong, oil being cheap, and the stock markets providing good returns. We are still in an oversold downtrend on the daily and will continue until some upward pressure to combat the selling pressure from new merchants.
@_date: 2015-04-27 17:37:15
This is strange. Their volume is very high today (almost 4x) compared to what they normally are at and their price is usually $5 less than others. Look at BTC traded in 24 hours. Above BitFinex. Very fishy. 
Their Russian market is going crazy too with volume so wonder if there is some larger rumor to this. 
@_date: 2015-04-21 12:39:10
Over all the markets, the upwards buy pressure is still lacking so any boost is a temporary gain. We have more downward pressure from new merchants and most people here hold more than that daily volume. I guess any news is good news tho.
@_date: 2015-09-22 15:46:20
Any mining pool esp the larger ones have a head start (even tho currently small) when they find a block and start work on the next one while other miners are flushing their work queues. The issue is gonna get bigger when blocks break the 1MB size and could take longer to propagate through the network.

It isn't hard to bury inputs into other transactions and hide it. The block chain is visible but you can generate new wallets and mix coins pretty easily. Without the direct help of a entity like an exchange or someone in the middle that can track an address, it actually is really hard to find the person who controls the stolen coins.
As it was mentioned, most people who have that much of an high value item (art, drugs, cash, etc) have a buyer setup that can easily move the item. These things are planned. Very rare would someone realize they can steal millions and then have to figure out what to do with it and despite what people say with the public ledger, it isn't that hard to wash inputs and hide coins in the chain. 
@_date: 2015-03-20 14:59:47
How they have spent that much money and not done anything yet is amazing. They have so much hype that has just died out with the 18 million dollars. I think the only code that was done was the Etherum/Counterparty name that tune battle where they did each other in X lines of code.

The orphaning of non-segwit blocks begins block. Wouldn't there be a chain split as people who don't orphan them will keep the chain going or do we assume there will be full miner support and everyone will reject the non-segwit blocks keeping a single chain due to mining difficulty power?

Well you need to remember that some people perceive investing strategies different. I always assume most people are dumb with their money and most are. If they ask about bitcoin, I make sure they are clear knowing they may be holding for a while and OK with 20% swings up and down in a day. Most people watch stocks that move 0.1% a week and freak out, a lot can't handle Bitcoin so you need to tread lightly.

The original post was about a long term investment. The currency can exist but as for the dollar value of conversion and investment, it is a risky choice because for it to it $200+ requires a demand of people putting USD in exchange for Bitcoin. That ability goes away and suddenly BTC is back around $5. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 14:21:24
While it could evolve to people bartering other items for bitcoin, a big blow would be preventing any bank from dealing with virtual currencies and crippling the money flow in and out.

Bitcoin is one legal matter away from being destroyed. Will it happen? No one knows. It will have its countries that are ok with it but if there will be big governments trying to shut it down, people may be in trouble and fear it. 
Think online poker back in the early 2000's in the US. They couldn't stop companies offshore so they just made it illegal for banks to process transactions and for people to pull money in and out. If big governments make these transactions illegal, then suddenly you have a system that no one can get money out of and put into and down it goes.

Explain how a currency will exist if a country makes it impossible to buy it? Bitcoin had value because of its use and it being accepted so people are willing to pay fiat currencies for it. This allows people who accept bitcoin to convert to currencies and store it whatever way they choose. Explain how a store or bar for example will continue to use bitcoin if they are unable to convert it into USD or other fiat currencies to buy more goods.

How would such a limited way of buying BTC have a large enough effect to propel the value to $200+ levels? This isn't a diacussion of ways around the banks and laws but a question of if long term investing in bitcoin is a safe bet which it isn't yet. There is no real solid way that the currency will attain $250 levels again yet and it is a risky investment that could be profitable or could fall flat.
