Why would you need multiple blocks? Or coordination for that matter? BitFinex put up a bribe offer for anyone who mines on a reorged chain, weighting the earlier blocks more heavily. We know they're good for it, we don't even need any time-locking clevers. But if we did, decentralized low-trust coordination problems are exactly what smart contracts are useful for.
@_date: 2016-08-03 08:49:41
I doubt they'd do it with transaction fees, this is actual money not nerd pr0n.
Of course just because they're bitcoin miners doesn't mean they can't use a smart contract on Ethereum - you could do it trustlessly through BTC Relay -  but this is even less likely, for the same reason.
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:27:33


You could have put this point more strongly: Given rational self-interested miners, decentralization makes it more likely that miners will take the bribe. Participating in the attack rewards individual miner mining the block at the expense of the whole ecosystem, which has less valuable coins. This is less attractive to the extent that you represent a larger part of the ecosystem.
This is a classic Tragedy of the Commons situation, which in the case of the actual commons was resolved by a small number of rich and well-connected gentry fencing off the grazing land and keeping the small farmers out.

I support segwit on its overall merits but the cons as a scaling strategy are that it's complicated, which in turn makes deployment slow and uncertain, and requires a rewrite to pretty much all the wallets and other software that use bitcoin. It also only increases capacity in normal use a little bit (1.7x or less on current usage patterns, on the over-optimistic assumption that everybody upgrades their wallets), but increases the space available to someone trying to cause trouble a lot (4x).
The main con as an overall proposal (ie not a way to scale) is that it encourages miners not to download and verify signatures, which may work out badly. These miner-incentive-related considerations are complicated, however. 
@_date: 2015-12-20 01:35:10
Without getting into whether something bad happens above 2MB, the other benefit to capping the witness section below 4x the transaction section is that (as I think was saying) the upper part of the x4 wouldn't really get used in normal operations anyway, so it's only really of benefit for attackers.
I guess the people behind the proposal are thinking ahead to confidential transactions that have great big monster signatures, but if this thing is only a short-term can-kick in any case then maybe that's not worth optimising for yet.

Maybe worth adding that if you're going to do this you want a block that will propagate very fast when you actually do broadcast it. That way if you see somebody else announce a rival block before you announce yours, you can fire it out quick and still have a reasonable chance of winning.

If this was true gambling sites couldn't do zeroconf, but they can and do.
What is true is that zeroconf in untrusted situations requires ongoing vigilance to catch new kinds of transactions that may be intended to be double-spendable, which will sometimes show false positives, and although it works now a miner policy change could break it any day.

Funds are slightly more secure if you've never spent from the address before, for two reasons:
1) The public key isn't known until you use it to spend from the address, so even if an attacker had some currently unknown technique to guess the private key based on the public key, they still wouldn't be able to steal your money because they wouldn't know the public key.
2) If there was a weakness in the way your software is signing a transaction, each signature can make the private key easier to guess. People have actually lost money this way.
Both these things are true with multi-sig P2SH addresses as well as normal pay-to-address transactions.

I don't have a strong opinion on this overall but I don't think there's much evidence Satoshi knew a lot about cryptography. One of the interesting things about bitcoin is that while all these mathematics wizzes had been trying to do p2p currency with all kinds of cryptographic clevers, bitcoin solved the problem they couldn't with fairly simple stuff: Hashes, merkel trees, regular signatures made with openssl.

What he was actually doing (allegedly) was trading while insolvent. This is illegal in most places.
The idea of fractional reserve is that you're owed money to the value of the money you owe, but you just can't get the money you're owed paid back immediately, so if your creditors all demand their money back at the same time you won't be able to pay them. If that was the situation here the trustee would be able to sell off the loan book and the depositors would get most or all of their money back.

Yup, if you listen to the podcast he's talking about voting by miners, not nodes. 
It's not really practical for nodes to vote, thanks to sybil attacking etc. But I doubt miners will want to upgrade without seeing a reasonable amount of buy-in by the people they ultimately sell their coins to, so if the rest of the community were to respond with a resounding "meh" it's unlikely there would be a mining super-majority.

I'd be a bit surprised if Tor was over-run with people trying to run full bitcoin nodes on it; The obvious thing to do is to if you want to use bitcoin without leaking information to SPV nodes or whatever would be to download blocks over a normal connection and just use Tor to send transactions, which are tiny.
If you want to hide the fact that you're using bitcoin from the authorities but still need a full node then you're probably better renting a VPS in a free country and connecting to that over Tor. Like I say absent a bunch of extra clevers that you have to get right the predictability of the traffic footprint probably makes things pretty obvious otherwise, even with teensy blocks.
But yeah, micro-payments for exit nodes sound like a great thing in general.
@_date: 2015-06-25 10:54:07
I agree, what Satoshi said shouldn't be treated as gospel. However, what he did have was a keen understanding how to make something simple enough for people to use in the right places, of which places had to be simple, of what downsides you could live with and still have a useful system, and of what behaviour you could expect from participants in the system and what you didn't have to worry about, etc. This looks easy in hindsight, but it's a rare gift - Steve Jobs also had it, hence things like a phone without a keyboard when competitors thought consumers wouldn't accept such a thing.
I think this is the key difference between Satoshi and some of the guys on the current core dev team, who want to optimize in favour of things that Satoshi didn't think was important, like running a full node at home, and can't seem to get their heads around the reasons why their (very technically clever) proposed solutions, like lots of semi-trusted parties that are supposed to cooperate in a payment network or different kinds of bitcoins with different block sizes, won't necessarily set the world on fire in the same way that just scaling up along the lines of Satoshi's plan will. 
@_date: 2015-06-26 01:01:20


Sure they are. Pushing transactions off the chain by limiting the number the system will handle is the *exactly* what creating "fee pressure" entails. 
People who want to do this are hoping that the the users whose transactions are pushed off the chain would migrate to the kind of systems you describe, which would (they hope) still use bitcoin underneath, so some of the fees that would have been paid by the end users are instead paid by these services, after the various semi-trusted third-parties take their cut. But they'd have different properties to bitcoin, so you can't expect that everyone you price off the chain will use them. When you turn a customer away, you don't get to choose where they go instead.

Sorry, you're talking about local LAN speeds? I'm talking about connections to the internet, which are what matters for this purpose.
There generally hasn't been much point in upgrading internal networks since more and more of what you want to access is on the internet, and you were still ahead of what your connection to that could do; My client that now has 1 gbps to the internet still has some old switches that only do 10% of that, but they'll be trivial to upgrade. I don't think I've encountered any new SMB-level networking equipment that doesn't do gigabit for quite a few years.
@_date: 2015-06-19 08:07:12


Yup, I should have said Nielsen's law, which gives a 50% increase every year. The sums in I did in my head (which I think match yours) were based on doubling every 2 years, which is slightly slower than that, and significantly slower than Moore's Law. Obviously we can't be sure this will happen and it could go slower or faster, so I'm not saying we can necessarily hard-code these numbers in the software right now, but the point I'm making is that even with no other improvements long-term on-chain bitcoin-everywhere does actually sound doable, if it were to come to that. But frankly scalability is the least of our problems getting from here to there - I agree with you that even moderate short-term growth isn't nailed on.
Anyhow what we need to be doing short-term to preserve and grow the network effects is optimizing for the needs of customers, including transacting when they want and at low cost. We're not going to win by being the restaurant that closes for lunch.

The idea that BIP 101 is going to stop people who want to validate transactions themselves from doing so is not sensible. 
BIP 101 maxes out at 8GB per block, which can be comfortably accommodated by a gigabit line; In well-governed locations like Tokyo you can get these at reasonable prices *now*. That's best-effort not guaranteed, but in practice you're getting 0.5 gbps both down and up. But BIP 101 doesn't allow blocks that big until 2036! 
I know some enthusiastic bitcoiners live in very poorly served bits of the US and still rely on technology from the 1880s. (This isn't sarcasm, they've got the same cables that were designed to handle Morse telephony.) But does anyone seriously think they won't be able to get where Tokyo is today in *20 years*?

I'm speculating here but I'm guessing he's still pushing this proposal because:
1) It's simpler and therefore easier to explain and harder to FUD, and thus has a better chance of getting deployed by the hard fork missile crisis route.
2) It leaves BIP 100 available as a compromise option if the small-blockistas decide they're willing to compromise. If Gavin advocated BIP 100 now they'd start thinking up reasons why BIP 100 was going to kill all the kittens, which would be hard to row back from later.
@_date: 2015-06-16 22:55:09
IIUC the thought is that the software already has a de-facto cap because that's the maximum size the code can handle, so regardless of what you do with the formal limit the max is still going to be 32MB until the next hard fork that fixes the code.
Arguably there's a difference of intent that will affect the ease of getting the next hard fork done, but seeing how the intent of the current limit was just temporary DoS prevention it probably wouldn't make much difference.

Is this to solve the problem that 51% can orphan the blocks of 49% and change the 75% threshold into a 51% threshold?

In reality I don't think the economic majority is going with him on this one unless there's miner buy-in, but it's an interesting hypothetical in some other cases. For example, if Goldman Sachs did a 51% attack and started reverting all our transactions, I don't think we'd just say, "Too bad. the mining majority says no more transactions, so that's the end of bitcoin". We'd fall back on IRC chatroom consensus and start doing checkpointing.
There's an argument that in that situation bitcoin is irreparably broken and we may as well give up, but if the economic majority does prove it can checkpoint its way through the attack then it still has a censorship-resistant currency on the other side. Arguably it's even stronger, because you've made 51% attacks pointless.

Reposting from the other thread where the OP posted the same thing.
To get you an idea how conservative Gavin's plan is, look at the peak bandwidth requirements for 8GB blocks in 20 years. 109Mb/s. You can rent a box with a connection fast enough to keep up with that NOW for a reasonable price. You wouldn't be limited to banks, governments and ISPs even if Nielsen's Law stopped today and there was ZERO bandwidth growth between now and then.
Admittedly the UTXO size would be the more pressing problem

So if I've got this right:
* The wallet provider sets everyone up with a default payment provider they trust or have a commercial relationship with.
* The merchant wants a payment provider they trust.
* Although you can separate the payer and payee across multiple hops, it's cheaper, faster and more reliable if you all use the same payment provider.
* A successful payment provider could decline to connect to other payment providers they don't like.
Can someone explain why anyone expects this arrangement to be decentralized in practice? 
@_date: 2015-06-22 21:56:41
The problem with the plan stopping at 8GB is that this community will form a primitive religion around the 8GB, and people will say it's essential to bitcoin for it to be 8GB. It will be OK is Gavin's still alive to say no, we just weren't sure what the tech would be like at that time, but if he's dead we'll have to have a really stupid argument again.
I propose adding a line to the BIP saying either that any further increases will be done by a new hard fork, or that Gavin isn't allowed to die.

The thing you quote doesn't say it works as long as they're all [small-game, short-term] rational, it says the majority has to be *honest*. "Honest" doesn't have to mean that they're friendly and altruistic - they could follow the rules for self-interested large-game, long-term reasons - but bitcoin doesn't work if the majority will do anything to make a short-term buck.
For instance, usually miners build on the longest chain, but they could collude not to. You could pay them to do this, just as you could pay them to put transactions they didn't see first in the memory pool. Hell, with game theory clevers like the Eccentric Billionaire's Attack it might not even cost you any money.
What x confirmations give you that zeroconf doesn't is safety as long as the majority is honest. Obviously that's a much higher bar, and only one dishonest miner is enough to potentially cost zeroconf vendors money so they have to manage their risk, but if all the miners are dishonest, bitcoin doesn't work.
It may ultimately turn out that there is indeed this tragedy of the commons and bitcoin doesn't work, but we'll see. The world is full of commons, and not all of them end in tragedy.

Well, one way for it to happen is if everyone's accepting and mining 5MB and some of the miners decide they'll only accept 4MB, but you have the same problem if everyone's accepting 4MB and one day a bunch of the other nodes decide they'll accept and mine 5MB.
In practice in a limit-free world I suppose they'd generally implicitly or explicitly coordinate since nobody wants their block orphaned, but it seems sensible to have an open process to do the coordination for them.
These problems could theoretically happen even apply *without* a block size increase or any other change: Imagine the Chinese government cranks up the internet censorship and Chinese miners find they can't keep up with 1MB, they could theoretically start trying to unilaterally lower the limit. Ultimately I suppose the network would sort itself out, but you might get high orphan rates in the meantime.

I know it's taking a while to get more efficient block propagation done (since validation has tended to be the bottleneck the most extreme bitcoin developer technical badassery has been deployed there) but I think it's reasonable to assume that by 2036 you'll only generally have to download each transaction when it's made, rather than having to get them all in one go all over again when they're organised into a block. So no, you won't need to be able to get new blocks in a tiny fraction of the block interval to validate reasonably promptly.

The cost of the network is mainly proof-of-work, so pushing customers off and hoping the alternatives they use instead rely on bitcoin underneath doesn't help.

You have a fixed cost for proof-of-work that ultimately has to be paid for by transactions, so trying to stop customers from using it is completely fecking mental.

* By getting the community riled up for and against the change then counting nodes as evidence for support for one side or the other, they get people setting up XT or Core and supplying blocks to the network at their own expense, which helps make sure there's enough bandwidth out there for the next wave of SPV wallet users.

This is very complacent. Bitcoin isn't their only option. Most use cash or German banks. In any case Satoshi's system is now available to anyone, so if the people running bitcoin decide they don't want to scale it like Satoshi intended, somebody else will and their system will win the payments business over bitcoin. Alternatively some unrelated system will win - there's a lot of innovation in the fintech space nowadays.
It's possible that at this point bitcoin will still be valued as "digital gold" even if it's not useful for paying people any more, but it's certainly not inevitable. I don't think it's even likely: The world wants one money, and if you have the choice between savings you can spend and savings you can only sell, there's no particular reason to prefer the crippled version.
The weird thing right now is that while the outside world sees bitcoin as a disruptive technology that might succeed in future, much of the community is behaving like it's already won. Bitcoin is already turning itself into a slow, lumbering incumbent that takes its customers for granted. The danger here is always thay by the time the incumbent sees somebody else out-competing it, the game is already over.

Well, even if the other miners have a mechanism to punish them the alternative to uploading slowly was just to sit on the block for a bit before publishing it so you get a head-start working on the next one. I think you still have a little bit of plausible deniability there. Either way if you do this to a significant degree, whether you're holding off publishing or deliberately uploading blocks for your multi-million-dollar 30% pool through a very slow connection like 1870s Morse telegraphy or American consumer DSL [1], the network is going to catch on pretty soon. The difficult part isn't how you find out so much as what you do about it once you do.
[1] The first of these is faster.
@_date: 2015-06-16 03:56:40
It's not hurting. There's no problem for SPV wallets to download blocks, and there's no risk that miners will mine invalid transactions without anybody noticing. It's fine.
Centralization of *mining* is a problem, but adding a bunch of non-mining nodes wouldn't make any difference to that either way.
@_date: 2015-06-21 10:41:10
What you say is true, but there's another point apart from that: Any rule over and above the rules set in the client can be implemented by 51% of miners as a soft fork. For example, if miners were very superstitious they ban the use of addresses starting with the number 13 by refusing to mine on top of any block that contained one.
So if miners thought block sizes allowed by the protocol were too big and they didn't want anyone else to create them, they could agree among themselves that anything bigger than x MB would be orphaned. If 51% of miners went along with this the rule would be enforced, and presumably the other 49% would stop creating those blocks too rather than see their blocks keep getting orphaned.
Jeff Garzik's proposal formalizes this by giving miners a way to vote, and creating a set of rules for how the soft-fork limit is to be set, but if they chose miners could adopt similar rules without anyone else agreeing to them. In the event that Gavin's current proposal ends up getting adopted but turns out to be too optimistic about bandwidth growth etc, it's not hard to imagine miners getting together and enforcing a rule like this themselves.

That's the threshold for the decision, not the amount of mining power that will be on the new chain 2 weeks after the decision. I'm not sure XT will make 75%, but if it does nobody will want to be left mining the dead chain two weeks later.

Also if what Adam is saying is correct and there's a process underway to settle on something like BIP 100 that will result in action within a reasonable timeframe, he has nothing to fear from Gavin's fork. Not only will Gavin presumably not release it if this thing gets done, even if he did no miner would run it over the "official" version.
What he's saying doesn't remotely correspond to the conversations on the mailing list to date, but hopefully there's some progress being made elsewhere. I guess in a month or so we'll be able to see whether he's right or whether he's just stalling.
@_date: 2015-06-13 09:59:59
That sounds fine to me, except that I guess the extension blocks are just a particular kind of side-chain, and we all love side-chains and want to see them implemented (except maybe so there's no particular need to couple it with the block size. If the changes it needs to bitcoin are ready to go, great.
PS while we're declaring peace in our time it might be good to take another look at suggestion of targetting utxo size instead of block size - that's one of those good ideas that can only be done by consensus and isn't really open to people who feel they have to resort to a hard fork missile crisis, because it makes the change harder for semi-technical people to understand and therefore easier for opponents to tie up in FUD.

That won't happen over this. The change doesn't go live until it gets 75%, and it won't get 75% unless it's clearly acceptible to the people miners sell their bitcoins to, particularly payment processors and exchanges. This is quite a high hurdle, but if it's cleared then it's game over: The remaining 25% will nearly all move over in the 2 week grace period rather than be left mining dead coins, and with hardly anybody mining it the old chain will slow right down and become unusable until at least the next difficulty adjustment, if it ever makes it there. Even if it survived it would be easy for miners on the main chain to attack, and just the threat of that will tank the price, making it even less likely that anyone will mine it.

If they have a hard time getting transactions out because of censorship then I and many people who currently have their nodes behind firewalls or only turned on some of the time would open them up. If that didn't work people would start to pay small fees to broadcast their transactions, which loads of people would compete for.
Relaying isn't like mining where if you can control a majority you can mess with the network.  Bitcoin doesn't make strong assumptions about the honesty of the majority of relaying nodes, because it's easy to mount a sybil attack. If the miners are prepared to mine your transaction, you should always be able to find *some* way to get it out to them.
@_date: 2015-06-20 22:56:55

The correlation between more tps and centralization in any given range is just speculation - it may turn out to be the opposite. For example, people have been looking at the drop in the number of nodes and blaming it on the number of transactions, but it may be that more transactions means higher usage, and higher usage means more nodes. It's hard to be sure except at the extremes.
Presumably if the number of nodes starts going up, the people who have been opposing raising the block size based on the node count data will start arguing for a faster increase instead.
@_date: 2015-06-12 14:01:39

In the event that there was still 25% on the old version at switch-over time there might just be a few people who needed to tweak their confirmation settings to require more confirmations in expectation of a temporarily higher orphan rate.
But this is unbelievably unlikely. To think this is going to happen you have to believe that there are 75% who are strongly enough in favour of bigger blocks to upgrade to a much-FUDded alternative bitcoin without needing to, 25% who are so passionately small-blockist that they wouldn't upgrade even at the risk of mining worthless coins, and nobody in between.
@_date: 2015-06-25 00:24:19
This is where the grace period comes in. It's a bit pointless trying to simulate this on testnet though, because there's no financial reward to mining blocks and thus not much incentive to make sure you're on the main chain.

No, overriding a centralised veto isn't intrinsically centralising; If there was only one shop in a town and they therefore had a veto what everyone could wear, and somebody else opened up another shop that sold people other clothes, they wouldn't be making things more centralised by overriding the veto.
If Gavin was doing what Mike Hearn suggested and just revoking other people's access and taking over Core then that would be more centralised, but that's not what's happening. 
That said, unlike the OP I don't have a strong opinion on whether centralisation or decentralisation is better here; Governance is full of little paradoxes, and if it turns out a centralised structure is the best way to make sure I can send money freely and cheaply without someone getting in my way that's fine by me.

Running a node doesn't allow you to enforce miners building on the longest chain. Other miners do that by making it more likely a block that doesn't will be orphaned, but you can't stop a majority of miners from applying some other rule like "pay us to orphan a branch".
Ultimately bitcoin's security is based on miners following Satoshi's rules, and they follow Satoshi's rules to protect the usefulness of bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-06-10 04:55:03
Very much disagree with this. The bandwidth of Chinese miners is pretty much the only thing that matters in the block size debate.
What doesn't matter are full nodes. Bitcoin doesn't rely on having a majority of honest nodes (it can't since it's trivial to make one node look like many) and downloading blocks is working fine. If it stopped working fine, plenty of people would be incentivized to step up and providing block downloads, and if that failed it wouldn't be rocket science to work out a way to pay for what you download. The number of nodes are dropping because people have client software more appropriate to their needs, working exactly the way Satoshi always said it would.
Perverse mining incentives in China, however, really have the potential to mess shit up. The most productive discussion on this whole issue so far was the conversation with a Chinese mining pool operator on bitcoin-devel on what his problems might be and what technical measures he or developers could take to improve them as the system scales.

This is true. If you were trying to make a governance team for bitcoin, you'd reflect that by bringing in people from a wide variety of different companies, and avoid having multiple people from the same company. If someone on the board joined a company that was already represented, one of them would step down and give someone else a chance to be represented.
We don't have this kind of thing for bitcoin because it was - or so we thought - just a free software project that anyone could fork. In a free software project, the people who do the work get the say. Blockstream is paying a bunch of great developers, they're doing excellent and tireless work on their software implementation, they get to decide how it works. If you don't like how they do it, you can fork the project and maintain it yourself.
But since Gavin announced his fork, has started trying to tell us that the core dev team isn't just a group of software maintainers, it's also the governing body for the protocol, and it's illegitimate to try to release software that changes the protocol against their veto. It's not obvious to me that he's right, but if he is then it urgently needs to reform itself to reflect the interests of the community properly and fix this enormous bias towards his company.
@_date: 2015-06-22 23:18:15
That depends what you're running the node for. 
If the aim is to provide blocks to other people, say SPV wallets, then upload bandwidth is going to be a problem, so you shouldn't try to do that on a shitty home connection that doesn't have any spare bandwidth to share.
But if the aim is to be able to validate transactions yourself so you don't have to trust someone to do it for you, just downloading is fine.

Disagree, it'll be settled by mining power. If XT gets 75% the vast majority of the remaining hashpower will upgrade before big blocks go live  rather than be left mining coins that can only be used for buying things from Mircia Popescu. And if it doesn't get 75% then nothing happens.

The headline isn't ideal but I think the article does a good job of summarizing the different factions in the block-size psycho-drama.
The Mircea Popescu faction has an economic theory where it's good for transactions to be scarce, not just money. This is a different kind of objection to the other small-blockistas listed, so it's worth mentioning.

I don't think Jeff's proposal is dead and buried yet - the problem right now is simply that none of the veto players ~~(basically the Blockstream team)~~ have suggested that they'd accept it, or anything specific based on it.
If they're deploying by hard fork missile crisis rather than finding something they can agree on with the core committers then Mike and Gavin will probably need to go with the simplest, easiest-to-understand change they can come up with, because anything else is going to get FUDded to death.

@_date: 2015-06-08 11:19:37
Possibly - that's how a free software project would normally work. But bitcoin's a bit particular in that:
1) The world wants one money not lots, so while we're busy forking different versions and seeing which one wins the market may just get sick of dealing with our shit and use different money.
2) Hash power for winning bitcoin versions can attack losing bitcoin versions, which is a whole new dynamic that we're not really used to dealing with.

OK, slightly long post with links, because people keep trying to explain the situation to you but you don't seem to believe them.
I don't think anyone's specifically said they support 1MB forever, but IIUC the following people have expressed concerns about increasing the block size soon, and either outright opposition or silence when it comes to any specific, actionable plans for when and how:
* Greg Maxwell
* Pieter Wuille
* Wladimir van der Laan
* Adam Back 
See this thread and the ones leading up to it to see Gavin trying to find a concrete plan to increase the block size that would get their agreement:
Gavin's said he'd be happy to support BIP 100 if they're happy with it:


I'm not sure what Mike Hearn's take is on BIP 100 but without Gavin there's no way the fork would fly, so if the people above agree to BIP 100 or some other reasonable block-size-increasing plan and it gets accepted into Core then there will be no fork.
Maybe they will agree to something and there won't be a fork, but right now the options that don't have someone with an effective veto blocking them are:
a) Status quo with no fork.
b) Gavin's proposal with the XT fork.
PS. I wouldn't be surprised if we ended up with
 
c) BIP 100 with the XT fork.

Never needed to happen before, wouldn't need to happen unless the (deeply bonkers) hypothetical suggested by the 1984 guy happened, but even if it did it would happen gradually (Moore's Law stops, blocks gradually grow) so you're not going to have everybody suddenly unable to mine out of nowhere.

@_date: 2015-06-02 10:18:51
BTW where it goes from a reasonable point to crazy-pants is at the next step (around minute 56 on the LTB discussion  ) . 
Gavin says (paraphrasing), "OK, say we can improve the software to make these big blocks propagate as fast as the current small ones, would you support this then?". Peter says, "It's not in the interests of miners to use software with faster propagation, because you only need 30% of hashing power to have your block to make it most likely you'll get the next one". 
This is true, but it's also true now, without block size going up. It's rational (on the definition of "rational" he's using here) for 30% of hashing power to only share blocks with each other and withhold them from the rest of the network until the last minute ("selfish mining"). If they wanted to do this, there would be no need for them to wait for a bigger block size to do it.
There's a similar conversation on zero-conf security where Peter Todd has a theory that we should embrace replacing transactions in the mempool with new transactions with higher fees because miners will do that anyway. Mike Hearn points out that if the assumptions behind this were right, they'd also apply to confirmed transactions in blocks. 
The root of this is that he's making a bunch of assumptions about miner rationality and short-term profit-seeking behaviour that are a lot stricter than Satoshi's assumptions. They may actually ultimately turn out to be right, but if they're right then bitcoin doesn't work in the first place.
@_date: 2015-06-21 22:18:01
To get you an idea how conservative Gavin's plan is, look at the peak bandwidth requirements for 8GB blocks in 20 years. 109Mb/s. You can rent a box with a connection fast enough to keep up with that NOW for a reasonable price.  You wouldn't be limited to banks, governments and ISPs even if Nielsen's Law stopped today and there was ZERO bandwidth growth between now and then.
Admittedly the UTXO size would be the more pressing problem... 
@_date: 2015-06-07 02:39:31

Let's hope it doesn't, but I'd say the hypothetical where the Chinese government tries to make 51% of miners apply blacklists could easily come about. I'm not sure what we'd do in that situation, but check-pointing might well be an option.
@_date: 2015-06-09 12:37:01
That's dubious. Node operators do something helpful to ourselves (full validation without relying on someone to do it for us) but the lifting we're doing for the network is pretty weak - potentially providing some bandwidth to some SPV wallets, but they never seemed to be short of it in the first place.
If I compare what I do by running a node to what someone like Roger Ver does by always being ready to help out new people at the meet-ups and explaining bitcoin to everyone he meets, it's pretty clear that it isn't me who's doing the most for the network.
@_date: 2015-06-21 13:42:00

People are aware of the risks, making appropriate trade-offs, doing business and making money. Some people running zeroconf gambling sites are making a *lot* of money. Can you explain what you think they're doing wrong?
@_date: 2015-06-21 09:32:56
This is a bit mad.
They couldn't *quietly* do anything - as soon as they orphaned a couple of blocks everyone would notice and respond, their upside would be minimal, and other miners would potentially orphan their blocks to punish them, in which case they'd have a huge downside, in addition to the damage they're doing to the value of bitcoin, and hence the value of their own coins. It would be an idiotic move even if it worked.
But even if it wasn't, look at the logistics of actually pulling it off. They'd need to control 25% to avoid putting themselves on the minority side, which is already a lot, *even if no other miner switched during the grace period*. In reality as we've discussed nearly everybody will switch during the grace period, so they'd really need more like 50%. And if you've got 50% you can come up with plenty of much more profitable ways to abuse your power than this.
@_date: 2015-06-01 05:32:00

Interesting question, which made me wonder. (Purely academic, since like I said I think it's RAM that gets you anyhow, aside from the fact that on Gavin's plan we don't have to deal with this for at least 20 years.) I'm probably doing this wrong but I thought I'd have a go. Hopefully someone will tell me if I'm bollocksing it up.
Here's the CPU on my laptop, which is the cheapest model Mouse Computer sell:




 
So I run


Then get a bunch of per-txin verification numbers with:


This looks to be typically a little under 0.020ms/txin, with around 2 txins per tx, so 0.04ms/tx, or 25000 Tx/s.
Someone was posting that the 8GB blocks are 27300 Tx/s, so if they're full all the time my little Mouse Computer is going to fall behind. But if I got one a couple of models up...

Obviously this is only useful if the fees you need to pay to make this transaction are lower than the value of the transaction. The logic behind limiting blocks to create "fee pressure" to fund miners is that it often won't be, because in the small-block world the fee per-transaction has to be many times greater than the fees we'd have otherwise just to make up for the lower volume, and that's before you start trying to get the extra fees you were trying to squeeze out of users.
PS I'm not sure if this is an argument against something advocates or not - on the merits he seems to be agreeing with about everything except process and disagreeing with the core devs who were holding this thing up in the first place, but it's unclear because he doesn't seem to think this disagreement even exists.
@_date: 2015-06-15 01:15:40
Dunno, maybe we end up with something like Jeff's proposal via the XT fork route. Just thinking about the politics of it, the practical problem in getting this thing adopted without ending up with blood in the streets is going to be getting a super-majority of miners on board, and the obvious way to allay any concerns they might have (justified or not) is to give them a veto on future increases.
@_date: 2015-06-12 13:44:49
Yup, fortune favours the inert. In Japan this is kind-of institutionalized: You pass a bit of paper around and everyone has to stamp it to show they've seen it. If they don't like the idea, they just stick it in a drawer and leave it there for a few months...
The other classic blocking move we're seeing is to pick up some detail of the process and talk like if only you'd followed that process you wouldn't have all this messy disagreement. So people are saying we could have got consensus *if only Gavin had made a BIP*. Then he'll make a BIP, and they'll come up with something else.

Since the restrictions to the block size in BIP 100 are applied by soft fork, 51% of miners could, if they chose, introduce them themselves at a later date.
I doubt this will be necessary as Gavin's rate of increase is fairly conservative, but the possibility of doing it does provide a fall-back in the event that:
1) Network speed or some other resource doesn't grow as expected.
2) Some miner continues to create large blocks that other miners consider too big to handle.

Presumably the Tx is mostly your node generously sending stuff to other people, so if you didn't have the bandwidth to send that much you could still keep receiving.
Anyone got any ideas what the rest of the 50kbit/s coming down would be? It seems like a lot even with full blocks, lots of transactions that never get into blocks and our primitive pre-IBLT thing where we download everything twice.
@_date: 2015-12-06 01:24:31
Well, there's no *automated* way to do that. What actually happens is that everybody freaks out and posts to social media. On one of the threads someone will post a proof that there's something invalid in a block, like an invalid transaction that people can individually check. Or if the problem is spending a non-existent output, you'd have a challenge-response protocol, eg:
Transaction x has a bogus input!
No it doesn't!
OK. which block is it in?
Block y!
No it isn't!
This process is squishy and human and non-rigorous, but you're relying it already in practice, because nobody can guarantee that the software you're using to validate is bug-free.
@_date: 2015-06-09 04:25:30
Fairy nuff. But I think you'll agree neither of those things is likely to happen quickly. 
So if people out there are thinking, "If full blocks cause a lot of people to give up on bitcoin there will be a consensus and we'll deal with it then" they're clearly mistaken, because key small-blockistas wouldn't join the consensus under those circumstances.
@_date: 2015-06-23 20:36:05
Well, it's kind-of meta-decentralized, because the participants get to choose which expert to defer to. It's like Pirate Party-style Liquid Democracy instead of Direct Democracy.

I'm saying a process consisting of "anyone can make a version of bitcoin and try to persuade the network to run it" is a decentralised model, whereas "small group of guys mostly working at Blockstream have a veto" is a centralised model.
I don't have a strong opinion about whether centralisation is better or worse in this context, but I think nearly everyone would like to see Core agree to a realistic actionable plan, and if they do that the fork issue will be moot.

I bet it's the network that's the bottleneck, unless your bitcoind is very old. Validation is crazy fast nowadays. You can sync up in a reasonable timeframe on way crappier hardware than that.
But in practice even a minute to sync would be too long for convenient payments, so if you don't want to leave the computer running an SPV wallet is going to be what nearly everyone will choose. The attacks that are possible on SPV but not a full node are a little bit exotic (leaving block rewards on the floor to instead mine a chain of blocks with invalid transactions in it, for example) which is why, as Satoshi anticipated, most people aren't going to run full nodes, big blocks or not.
It seems a bit eccentric to optimize for the tiny number of users with lousy connectivity who do want to do this, especially since they have other reasonably low-cost options like renting a cheap box somewhere with a better network. Or, in your case, just leaving the sodding computer turned on.

We won't know until such time as such things actually exist in the real world, but it's quite possible they'd have a lot of the same pathologies. Lightening would be at its most reliable and efficient with fewer hops, so you potentially end up with large, regulated institutions playing this role. They might even *be* traditional banks. And it's not obvious that we'd end up with an open network, as opposed to the institution that had signed up the merchant refusing to peer with unapproved transaction providers.

This is actually an unproven speculative claim that may be wrong - or rather, anyone would be able to host lightening hubs, but there's no guarantee that they'll be able to join the network that includes the merchants people want to pay. Depending on their eventual regulatory status, it may actually be illegal for people running hubs connected to merchants in the legal economy to peer with just anybody who shows up.
Even if it's legal, successful hubs will have a strong incentive not to let competitors into their network. See what just happened with Fidor in the UK: The regulators said, "Sure, your groovy internet bank can operate here", but the existing payment hubs said, "Coming over to disrupt our business, are you? Actually we'd rather you didn't."

Yeah, the fee pressure argument always seemed a bit bonkers. I mean, imagine you were creating a payments startup with a huge network effect, and you were getting a bit of traction but still very much a minor player, would you really want to raise prices and turn away most of your potential customers? It just seems like you'd do what you think miners will do and try to scale up so you could multiply a small number by a big number rather than trying to do it the other way around.
I think I agree with you, though: It seems nice to be able to run a full node at home, although I think any realistic censorship-related benefit is exhausted by being able to run on a high-end PC on a good connection, which was what Gavin was shooting for, rather than optimising for an old Raspberry pi and shitty American DSL. Obviously the downside is that trying to control the optimal limit this way means ongoing governance issues and this argument going on forever.
@_date: 2015-06-24 13:16:08


Which would be a serious risk, so merchants wouldn't touch it, so it wouldn't be valuable, so the hashing power would take a dive. The best the continuity small-blockists could do would be to take the value of people's bitcoins and use it to start a new coin with a different proof-of-work.
Remember miners need to be able to sell their coins to somebody, so they won't jump in the first place unless they see they'd have acceptance from payment processors and people who buy the coins they mine. It'll be hard for XT to get to 75%, but if it does, it's over.

I had this conversation with a while back but I think this just moves the problem, because now you have a grey area about whether something's unclear or not.

We did the social contract thing a bit on Twitter - I think this is obviously different to red-lists or black-lists, not least because raising the block size was always what Satoshi said would happen. Obviously just because Satoshi intended to do it way back when doesn't automatically mean that it's a good idea, but as far as the social contract goes, do you see the difference?
Anyhow, where I came in was wondering what the process would be that you think *would* be an acceptable way to do this. You've described what you think it *shouldn't* be, although I don't think it matches what happened - for instance, the threat to fork didn't come until after a long discussion on the mailing list (mostly rehashing conversations that have been going on for literally years) with none of the veto players suggesting anything concrete that they actually would support, and it's hard to believe it would have been any different if the same proposal had had a BIP number. But that aside, what do you think should be the hurdle here? How much opposition does it take to make something unacceptably controversial?
@_date: 2015-06-27 03:04:48


No. No no no no no no. This is not an engineering problem. 
This a regulatory and legal liability problem. The costs of international regulatory compliance and dispute resolution far outweigh the cost of recording the transaction. That's the reason nobody has nailed micropayments, not because nobody has got around to doing it cheaply yet.
Satoshi understood this - it's right there in the introduction to the white paper - and it's getting quite painful watching experts in engineering and cryptography who don't understand the regulatory context trying to redesign the whole thing to optimise for engineering problems at the cost of the actual problems the world has with payment systems. (Anyone know what the regulatory exposure of Lightening network payment hubs would look like?)

Aside from theoretical game theorists it would be interesting to get some input from political theorists who study what actually happens in the real world. I'm having a hard time thinking of real-world examples of decision-making thresholds in the 66.7% to 99.9% range; I suspect this is because by the time you have more than 2/3 you've probably got firm enough support from 51% to push through whatever procedural shenanigans you need to get what you want.
@_date: 2015-06-22 05:11:47
This is true, but IIUC it potentially gets pretty big, unlike network bandwidth which isn't a serious practical problem under this proposal.
I think the reason the small-blockists are focussing on bandwidth is because limitations feel like something that's foisted on you by your home ISP. (It's not really, because you don't have to keep the box at home.) If they started talking about the difficulty of putting x much RAM in a box at low cost, bitcoin people would consider it a challenge.

That wouldn't be the goal, I think the two widely-deployed versions only last until either big blocks get 75%, or something happens that makes it moot and nobody wants to run the patched version any more.
The ideal way to handle the period where users work out which version the network should run would be to incorporate Gavin's patch in Core but turn it off by default, but it's understandable the core devs who strongly oppose the patch wouldn't want to make it any easier for people to deploy it.

Anyone can be a bank, but it's no good setting up your own bank if the other banks won't let you into their network. What you're describing sounds like it would have the same problems: The network centralizes around a few providers for cost/efficiency/reliability. There may even only be one. We hope they form an open system and peer with any other provider, but they'd be heavily incentivised to form a closed system, as banks have tended to it the past.
There is nothing like this at all in bitcoin. The level playing field is a fundamental feature of the design, because the whole network is the payment processor.
@_date: 2015-06-20 23:43:40
Bitcoin doesn't do coercion protection at the level of contributing developers. If it did it would be a concern that too many of the core team are in the US and too many work for same company, but it doesn't so that's OK. Bitcoin is designed so you don't have to trust or obey the core developers. This is a great example: If the users think they're wrong about the block size, they'll run code that the developers disapprove of. And if Mike Hearn put in the kind of changes you mention, users wouldn't run his code.
On the BIP, IIUC there's one on the way, but it's often considered good manners to write the code that implements the BIP first.

An attack won't *necessarily* happen, but there would be a substantial risk of it happening, which is a serious knock to the value of the fork that's already lost users.

@_date: 2015-06-21 01:18:41
S/he's right in that it's possible that the miners could try to do something that wasn't in the interests of the economic majority, and the economic majority would then have the ability to ignore the miners' longest chain and rely instead on a shorter chain that implemented their preferred rules. Presumably this is what would happen if miners tried to change to a version of bitcoin that increased the block reward.
But in practice this is moot, because miners aren't going to want to risk mining coins that nobody wants to use, so if there was serious opposition among people who actually use bitcoins (or the people they delegate their bitcoin choices to, like wallet developers and payment processors) you wouldn't get anything like 75% miner support in the first place.
@_date: 2015-06-02 07:41:05
Trying to fill this out a bit to give the argument a fair shot. 
Miners make blocks and send them out across the network. In normal conditions, if your block is slow to propagate to the rest of the network, you have a higher orphan rate, so you make less money than people with fast propagation. This means that you'll be more profitable if you:
 * a) Have a fast internet connection to the rest of the miners.
 * b) Share a data-center with a lot of other miners.
 * c) Have a really big mining operation.
Note that this is worse than just needing a fast connection to mine. You want a fast connection *to other miners*. For example, if most of the hash-power is behind the Great Firewall of China, and the said firewall was very slow to let traffic in or out, you'd be at a competitive disadvantage unless you located your node inside the firewall.

I agree with the fee market stuff is bullshit. The fee market is working fine without full blocks, and in any case it doesn't matter until the subsidy drops, which is too far off to be worth worrying about.
However, one reason why this proposal seems to be getting traction is that both sides think it would give them what they want. The small-blockistas think they'd maximise fee income by creating artificial scarcity and price pressure. The big-blockistas think they'd maximise fee income (not to mention block subsidy value) by making bitcoin cheap, popular and useful. The people who should know best are the miners themselves, so create a cryptographically unbreakable milk production quota cartel and let them decide what maximises their revenue.

I think in practice with these systems people are going to do the economically efficient thing and outsource their decision-making to dedicated data feeds or pools, in the same way that bitcoin miners outsource their transaction validation and timestamping responsibilities to mining pools.
This will:
1) Completely subvert the intentions of the designers of these systems.
2) Probably work pretty well...
@_date: 2015-06-20 07:28:55
Note that the cartel also works with highly distributed mining. It may actually be the only way to prevent the market doing a lot of M&amp;A consolidation if fees become a non-trivial part of mining revenue. Without the cartel the best way to maximize fee income, regardless of block size, is to roll up a lot of mining power into one corporation then say, "if you want fast confirmation you have to pay for it". Block size production quotas are an inefficient way to capture this consumer surplus, because they price a lot of traffic off the system altogether at peak times then charge less than they could get away with during the troughs.
I think I've convinced myself: The Decentralized Autonomous Cartel isn't just inevitable, it's a good thing: It's the only to avoid mining centralizing into one or two dominant companies.

Nielsen pegs internet speed growth at more like 50% per year.
I guess the difference is that while Nielsen is looking at a high-end user's connection, the Akamai numbers give you an average across all connections being used at the time, including mobile. Every time an existing PC user buys a smartphone as well, they pull down the average.
The same method would get you a rather uninspiring version of Moore's Law, because as CPUs get cheaper we're buying more, smaller, cheaper devices. You may even find a point on the smartphone adoption curve where CPU technology appears to go backwards.
@_date: 2015-06-16 22:04:03
It wouldn't be profitable in practice. These "strategic" clevers tend not to happen much in real life, not least because the theories tend to fixate on small games while ignoring the large ones, and assume dumb passivity on the part of competitors. If you did this you wouldn't get many extra blocks until the rest of the network either reverted or recruited more miners to their own side, and everyone would have it in for Mr Tricksy 25% and potentially start orphaning their blocks. No business is going to start trying to pick up pennies in front of a steamroller in this way.
PS If you look at how actual businesses operate it's obvious that the thing we need to worry about isn't chaotic free-market tricksiness, it's a cartel. Bitcoin's consensus system is essentially a tool for cartel maintenance and enforcement, complete with the ability to exclude people who disobey the cartel's rules. The great thing about Jeff's proposal is that it guides the participants as they do what they could do anyway, specify the parameters of the network they want and enforce it by excluding non-conforming blocks. In future they'll probably do the same thing with fee price-fixing as well.

This is what I mean about complacency. I'm a bitcoin proponent not a critic, and of course I'm aware of the network effects, but there's a limit to how much of our shit the market will put up with.


You're specifically trying to push people's transactions off bitcoin and onto something else. Coinbase needs a load of personal information and is a PITA, and neither lightening network nor sidechains even exist yet, and if they did we don't know if they'd work as hoped in the real world. The market will find a something else that people can actually USE to transact with, and that something, by definition, will be more USEFUL. If you force your users to go away, they will, and you don't get to decide where they go instead.
So where you end up is that one day more people take X than bitcoin, X has more liquidity and better network effects, people buy it to use, speculators notice and the price starts to ramp up while bitcoin does the opposite, and miners find it more profitable to mine X than bitcoin (if X uses mining). All this could happen very, very quickly. At this point it's not obvious that the rapidly plummeting bitcoin would be the go-to choice as a store of value.
BTW your numbers assume no improvements in anything except Moore's Law, which is probably overly pessimistic, and keep bitcoin usable on a high-end PC/network, which is much more conservative than Satoshi's suggestion that nodes could take whole data-centers. But just doing that you're at something like 1 transaction per day for everyone in the entire world in 20 years, then 32 transactions each in 30 years. It's more likely Lightening Network or something else takes some of the load off that in the meantime, but you don't need to cripple the network in the meantime for this to happen, because they have plenty of other advantages, not least being a lot faster. In practice it's not worth trying to optimize for what's going to happen years down the line - the immediate problem is just to keep bitcoin growing for the next 1 to 3 years.

Just to add, just because scaling via sidechains doesn't seem to make sense (it exposes the blockchain to the same "danger" that people think big blocks cause) doesn't mean it won't happen. 
The whole point of sidechains is that you can make your own rules without needing core dev permission, so if rightly or wrongly they won't give people permission to make cheap, simple on-chain transactions it seems inevitable that people will do it on a sidechain (or failing that, a different coin.)

If the recalcitrant miners just refused to upgrade then it would work as you describe. But they'd have some other options:
1) Accept big blocks up to the checkpoint, but orphan any big blocks after that.
2) Just do a regular 51% attack on the big-blockist chain and undo transactions or let people double-spend.
People do run alt-coins under these conditions, but it's obviously a much more dangerous place to be than having 51% of mining power agreeing with your rules and invested in enforcing them.
PS. I think this is all exceedingly unlikely to happen over the block size, but we get a similar dynamic with some more plausible scenarios that put the interests of miners up against the interests of users, like the Chinese government telling Chinese miners that they have to orphan blocks with payments from addresses known to belong to Tibetan or Uighur separatists.

No, it'll be almost impossible to lose money accidentally. SPV wallets will just follow the longest chain which will be the winning fork, people who run full nodes will almost certainly have heard about the change, if they haven't their software will be warning them that the network seems to have upgraded without them, and even if they hadn't seen that they should notice the fact that the network seems to have ground to a halt as all nearly the mining power moves to the other chain. (Once you hit 75% nearly all the remaining 25% will upgrade rather than be left mining a dead chain, and there are at least two weeks for them to do that before the chains diverge.)
Either way, you'd get the same dynamic whether the fork was distibuted as XT or turned on via an extra config setting in Core.

We can't expect more consensus than that because inevitably some people are just not going to be reconciled to a block size increase.

No, this doesn't eliminate deposit insurance.
Basically the idea is that instead of all the money a bank owes being to people who expect that they'll always get it back, like regular depositors, some of the bank's liabilities are going to have to be loans from people who make the loan knowing that they'll lose the money if the bank fails. These lenders will be able to get more interest than regular depositors if the bank is OK, but they explicitly don't get any protection if the bank goes to shit.
The result is that regular depositors below the maximum deposit insurance limit still won't really need to make informed decisions about where to bank, but it's less likely that taxpayers will end up picking up the bill.

This theoretical benefit is helpful even if they never tell anyone except their payer about the invalid block. If they also tell their friends, that multiplies the benefit.
@_date: 2015-06-26 22:52:09
The main security argument for small blocks is supposed to be that large blocks encourage miners to form larger companies or pools, which are then easier to censor. (I think the arguments for this in the range Gavin is talking about are a bit weak, but let's assume they're right for the sake of argument.)
 
Side-chains don't help with this because instead of needing to be big to keep up with the main chain, you now need to be big to keep up with the sidechain. You could just not mine the sidechain but presumably you'd be less profitable and get out-competed, assuming the sidechain is worth mining in the first place (and if it's not it's horribly insecure).

Nobody's rushing anything. Gavin's proposal wouldn't allow an increase until next year at the earliest, and it still doesn't change anything until two weeks after it gets 75% of hash power. It's a plan for a careful, controlled change done in a way that makes sure everyone has time to update and nobody accidentally loses coins.
The alternative proposed on the mailing list by some of the people who oppose implementing a plan now was to wait and see how things go, then try to push out an emergency patch in a matter of weeks if there's a capacity crunch. That's what rushing things would look like.

Can you talk us through the specific problem?
@_date: 2015-06-28 11:04:10
If someone's got 75% then bitcoin is already broken. But I guess my point was unclear. Miners need to mine coins that are acceptable to the people who would buy them. So the changes they can make to the protocol without seriously putting their investment at risk are limited by the acceptance of exchanges and merchants, who in turn need their bitcoins to be acceptable to users at large.
This is a good thing, because there are all kind of changes they could make as a soft fork with only 51% of mining power, without needing any action from bitcoin developers or users running full nodes.
@_date: 2015-06-25 11:30:46
Actually the other reason why bitcoin is a hard sell in Japan is that Japan is very cashful, and traditional cash works really, really well. There's very little street crime, you get the right amount of change, people accept high-denomination notes without scowling or bitching, and the authorities don't see anything weird about cash payments well over $10,000.
I think the niches for Japan are:
1) Payments to/from overseas.
2) Grey/embarassing online purchases.
3) Secret savings hidden from the taxman or your spouse.
4) Money you can send by fax. (This last one needs some infrastructure, but they're going to love it.)

Nothing happens until 75% have upgraded plus two weeks. At that point any remaining miners will upgrade rather than risk being left mining coins that are only useful for buying things from Mercia Pompescu, so basically everyone will be running the new version. Once somebody mines a big block the network will split but the old fork will have little to none hashing power on it.
At this point I assume the big block version will no longer be considered contentious and Core or bitcoin.org will update, but if people do download the old version it'll warn them that the network appears to have upgraded on them, and full node operators who ignore that will presumably think something's amiss from the fact that the network hardly ever finds a block any more.
Alternatively the big-blockistas never get 75%, and nothing happens.
@_date: 2015-06-24 05:12:28
Settling on a ledger seems pretty straightforward, if big blocks get 75% then there's a change and if they don't there isn't. Although it's only the miners who do the voting, they're not going to jump if there's a serious risk that they'll end up mining monopoly money, so they'll be looking at the attitude of the people who buy their bitcoins and you won't get 75% unless most people are broadly in favour.
Although there's a lot of drama and strong opinion around this, there aren't a lot of people out there on either side who care about it so much that they won't count the money backed by majority hashpower as money. Maybe Mircea Popescu, who has a whole *economic* theory of transaction scarcity and sees this like the rest of us would see raising the 21 million cap, but that's about it.
That said, if core can get together and get behind a reasonable, actionable block-size-raising plan, whether it's based on Jeff Garzik's plan or anything else, that will make the whole issue moot, which I'm sure everyone would appreciate.

More like 99%. Nobody will want to mine on the dead fork, so at this point you're really only looking at people who have forgotten about their mining stuff, and that won't account for any significant hashpower.

Maybe, but you don't need the exit nodes to be bitcoin relay nodes particularly, do you? Don't you just need them to pass your packets in and out?
That said, payment channels sound like a great way of incentivizing Tor exit nodes, or anything else where you want to download data from people who don't particularly care whether you have it or not.
As far as anonymity goes, if the aim is to avoid people noticing you're running bitcoin then I'd have thought the ship had already sailed - at the very least you'd need to come up with some tricks to stop immediately downloading blocks once they're broadcast, which must be a dead giveaway.

I'm not knocking Blockstream - Lightening and sidechains are cool and they're paying a bunch of smart people who are doing good work on bitcoin - but where we came in was talking about centralisation, and if you have a small group of people with a veto and most of them work for the same company, it doesn't make sense to say the veto must be upheld in the name of *decentralisation* of all things.
@_date: 2015-06-20 10:09:10
It's not Jeff's proposal that brings this state of affairs about though - miners can already do this. 51% can orphan the blocks of 49%, so they can make whatever additional rules they like on top of Satoshi's. What I like about his idea is that it formalizes something they can already do and that's in their interests, rather than designing some other behaviour and hoping they'll be gentle with us.
My point is just that I don't see why they'd be content just fixing a block size production quota, when they could make much more money fixing prices and potentially a bunch of other things.
@_date: 2015-12-24 03:20:56
What I mean by a transaction being double-spendable is that there's something about it that will cause some miners to reject it, like a too-small fee or an address on the Eligius blacklist. Absent that miners do generally follow the first-seen rule, and also do tend to propagate the transactions they've already seen rather than keeping them secret so you can't detect conflicting versions they may have received. 
This isn't guaranteed - for example if a miner has just restarted and the double-spender sends them the second spend at just the right time then they may mine it - but people are running profitable businesses relying on this behaviour. It's not 100% safe, but it's far from pure reliance on customer reputation or on the honours system.

I suppose people who oppose that will try to counter-act this by setting up full nodes running ~~bitcore~~ Bitcoin Core.

Thinking about idea of a cartel to raise fees some more, it occurs to me that it's only status-quo bias that's making us talk about trying to raise prices indirectly by limiting production, when the cartel could just us easily fix prices directly. They could do this via a soft fork in much the same way Jeff is proposing they limit block sizes, and there's nothing non-miners could do about it. This would allow for much more efficient pricing strategies than simple production quotas.
It's often hard to make cartels like this stick because small players have an incentive to break ranks, but mining is a weird kind of market where you need the cooperation of 51% of the competition to stay in business, so a cartel should be very easy to enforce.
Edit: Hang on, no, you could probably break the cartel by refunding the fees out-of-band.
Edit again: But why would anyone even want to break the price cartel?

When a debate is polarized, like block size debate is, you need to look at what both sides have in common and challenge that.
The assumption I don't buy in this whole conversation is that mining is going to be a competitive free market. Big blocks or little, Satoshi's consensus mechanism is pretty much perfect for enforcing a cartel. The majority can choose some pricing parameters that maximise revenue and orphan the blocks of anyone who tries to undercut them.
Maximising revenue will be the traditional trade-off between more customers and more money per customer. They'll set service tiers for how fast your transaction confirms, which will be a far more effective way of capturing their share of the consumer surplus than block size production quotas.
You could think of the mining cartel as a single payment-processing DAC: They'll vote on their rules and pricing strategies in the blocks they mine as Jeff Garzik suggested they could do with the block size, producing a set of consensus rules, over and above Satoshi's rules, that aim to maximise the usefulness of bitcoin, and with it their own revenue. They'll probably make more aggressive assumptions about things like mempools than Satoshi did, so they'll be able to provide features like zeroconf security (for a price) that bitcoin can't currently ensure.
I don't think I want this to happen, but it obviously seems to be in the miners' interests to do it. Can anyone think of a good reason why it won't?

The other problem for bitcoin in Japan is that *banking* has also looked more like bitcoin: Direct bank transfers are cheap and easy, you can do them online or from an ATM, and within the same bank it's free so a lot of merchants just set up an account with each of the main banks and it costs nothing to pay them. It's also traditionally been very easy and low-hassle to open a bank account, although this is finally changing as the banks come under pressure to deal with scams.

This is the bit where these guys are getting slippery:


No. Gavin's plan is for Bitcoin to scale up in exactly the way Satoshi said it would, and it's what people are reasonably expecting will happen.
Some people think that Satoshi was wrong, that bitcoin can't safely scale, that 1MB is already too much, that it's more important for end users to run full nodes than Satoshi thought, that it would be better used as a low-traffic settlement backbone for some other system, etc etc. There are some technical arguments and some game theory arguments for this - I'm not convinced but we should give them a fair hearing. Maybe they're right and this is what we should do. But if anyone's trying to make us switch to a new currency, it's them.

Not saying you're wrong, but what would be an example of the kind of attack scenario you're thinking of?

If that's how it appears to a lot of people then it does indeed sound like he bollocksed up the optics, but apart from this conversation having gone around and around since forever, this last round had a good three weeks of discussion on the mailing list before Gavin said he'd fork if the core developers couldn't reach consensus on a block size increase plan.

Now, you mean? Like everyone else making money from actual bitcoin activity (as opposed to consulting or whatever), Chinese miners want the block size to go up, not down. That way bitcoin will have more, cheaper transactions and be more useful to more people and the coins they mine will be worth more. The idea that 1MB blocks would be good for miner revenue is entirely bonkers, and none of the people it's supposed to benefit subscribe to it.


You're right that doing things that are clearly damaging to the network reduces utility and endangers their profits. This is one of the reasons a lot of the short-term-rational-seeming things miners are supposed to do aren't done much in practice. 
But cartels tend not to be framed as purely profit-seeking endeavors. In the real world they're often linked to self-regulatory bodies that do actually genuinely try to improve the service their members provide and stop consumers getting ripped off. So you start with miner-led regulation of the block size ("to protect the ability of people to run full nodes"), then you start orphaning the blocks of somebody enabling double-spending, then at some point when the hash rate is low you set minimum prices "to protect the security of the network" etc. Each turn of the ratchet has a good justification at the time, but the end result optimizes for the interests of the cartel members, not their customers.
But in this case, like I say, the cartel may actually end up being less bad for end users than the alternatives.
@_date: 2015-06-30 04:50:03
Maybe can comment I think this comes down to a disagreement over how we can reasonably expect miners to behave. If I'm reading his worldview correctly you should assume they'll do anything they can to make an extra dollar immediately, without considering large-game effects like responses by other miners and the effect on their bitcoin investments.
I wouldn't be surprised if this worldview ultimately turns out to be right, especially as control of mining gradually transitions from tech-savvy gentleman anarchists to psychopaths with MBAs and weird performance bonuses. But I don't think bitcoin works at all under those conditions, so it doesn't seem like a sensible thing to optimise for.

OK thanks, but how could an oligopoly running lots of relaying nodes control the protocol or censor transactions? Even if zero of the hundreds of nodes I can connect to will pass my transaction on to a miner I can send it to the miners directly myself.

We just provide public keys when you register a fact, then the appropriate private key when the date comes around. That's it. We don't interact with the contract at all; The parties have to do that themselves. We don't necessarily even know that there is a contract, and there could be many contracts using the same reality keys.
For bitcoin purposes you can think of us as performing the same role as a magical extension to the bitcoin that allowed miners to check actual things about the world, instead of just hashes and digital signatures. The effect is that as well as being able to script things like "these coins can be spent by a transaction signed with the private key to the public key xyz", you can script "these coins can be spent by a transaction signed with the private key to the public key xyz, but only if Hillary Clinton is President".

If I understand the BitPay process right when I pay for a Namecheap domain with them all that's happening is that Namecheap is sending them the amount of the purchase, they're sending me a payment address, I'm sending the bitcoin network a transaction and they're sending the merchant a message to show the payment was received. At some point BitPay will then remit the merchant dollars for my bitcoins. There should be no need for Namecheap to send BitPay any information about who I am, or even what I bought.

I think this depends a lot on location and situation. Here in Japan physical cash works really well - low street crime, nobody getting arsey about high-denomination notes etc - and the electronic cash systems are well developed too, so I've never really found a situation where I've felt it would be more convenient to use bitcoin at point-of-sale (although I do it to encourage merchants...)
Where I'd really like to be able to use bitcoin for retail is when travelling - you don't want to carry a lot of cash, credit cards suddenly get randomly cancelled on you and you already have a currency conversion issue. This is the kind of situation where you could have great network effects if you could bump up the proportion of bitcoin-using merchants and customers at - say - airports.

One goal was explicitly to facilitate "small, casual transactions" that financial institutions can't handle because they can't avoid getting drawn into mediating disputes, which makes small transactions too expensive. This is right in the introduction to the white paper.

The nasty thing about the GHash problem is that it's actually two different problems, and solving either one of them makes the other one worse. There's concentrated ownership of hardware and there's the use of big pools by distrubuted miners. If you try to break the pools, which are currently making distributed hashing more efficient, you increase the competitive advantage of someone who owns a lot of hardware.
The immediate problem is the pools, but hardware concentration is worse, because at least part of the pool would probably respond to shenanigans.

I don't think that particular commit alters the size limits that you're running into, but I think there's another change planned to relax the size limits so you can do 15/15. The commit you linked creates a formal limit of 15 signature checks while relaxing some other rules, which doesn't change the situation for normal P2SH transactions because the size limits are already stopping you doing more than 15. But either way that commit is still in the development code which hasn't yet been released, so hardly anyone is actually running it.

The normal story is that you'd rather own everything yourself, but if you can't do that then you'd rather nobody owned it than one of your competitors. 
What I'd imagine happening here is that they work on their own platforms for a while, then one of the four starts to look like it's going to win, and rather than let that happen the losers give up on their own platforms and put their efforts behind an open system like a crypto-currency.

That's pretty much exactly what's been in the press. There wasn't much about this part of it in English.
Basically there's a reported theft (reported by Gox, and also by some Japan-based individual Gox depositors) and the police are looking into it. We don't know how hard they're trying or what they think about it, but there was a report quoting an investigation source saying he was skeptical about whether the theft really happened as described by Gox.

This is the kind of thing I'm thinking about when I say other people involved may hold keys. They don't have to have them until the time-locked transaction is broadcast and spent, just until it's been created and given to the OP. But we can't really suggest a specific solution until the OP tells us more about the situation, for example who A and B are in this situation and what their incentives are.
@_date: 2014-04-18 09:40:22


This hasn't been very widely reported in the English-language press, but there is an ongoing police investigation into the alleged theft, and the police have been briefing journalists that they're not convinced by the hacking story.

If these things are problems, replacing that currency with bitcoin (*) makes them even worse. The countries that use bitcoin don't have single fiscal policy, and they can't set interest rates or print money.
(*) In practice people don't really use bitcoin in the same way as a normal currency, because they price things in some other currency then adjust in real time. But a lot of people do think it should be used like this, and these people should really prefer the Euro to what came before it.

Not just the fees, because they took my zero-fee tx.
I remember this because I was moving some money between wallets and I thought, "Bah, no hurry, I won't need it for half an hour" and zeroed out the fee. Then from the moment I pressed send the bitcoin network proceeded to process zero blocks for the next hour, and I thought, "Shit, treat the miners badly and they go on strike". (I grew up in Thatcher's Britain.)
Then Discus showed up and did the entire hour worth of txes in one block, like a bunch of scabs bused in from Nottinghamshire.

I guess IBLT changes the situation here - if I understood his previous argument it was that the orphan cost would put a natural limit on the block size miners will accept, so it's OK to leave it to them. If you no longer have to broadcast the whole block because people already have the transactions it contains, that takes away the disincentive for miners to put a lid on it somewhere.

Yeah, it was a teensy transaction and the coins hadn't moved in a while, so I guess it was relatively high priority among the zero-fee pool.

Obviously as a way of sending bitcoins to someone in an arbitrary country it's not very efficient to convert them into yen, then send them through the banking system. That said, there are some potential benefits to creditors:
1) It makes for a very transparent valuation method, which reduces the risk of litigation tying up everyone's money for decades while cash-heavy creditors argue with bitcoin-heavy creditors about how the bitcoins should be valued relative to the cash.
2) It offloads some of the identity verification work onto the banks, which makes it harder for thieves to cash out if they still have positive balances in the system, and increases the size of the remaining pool for non-sketchy creditors.
@_date: 2014-01-01 01:00:12
Technically maybe, but politically no. Remember the protocol change to introduce P2SH? It got held up while a couple of developers argued over some incredibily obtuse technical detail.

You can use it to make transactions for testnet, but because it relies on blockchain.info (which doesn't do testnet) it can't do things where you need to look at the actual blockchain, like getting unspent transactions with unspent(addr) or pushing transactions to the network with pushtx. In theory it should be possible to substitute a connection to a site running Abe or something similar, and fix or replace the blockchain.info-connecting code in bci.py. For my purposes I've been able to work around it by feeding in transaction output information manually, and outputting serialized transactions when I need to broadcast them so I can send them to the network manually with ./bitcoind sendrawtransaction.
 
You also need to feed in the Testnet "magic byte" when you create addresses, so instead of doing:
addr = pubtoaddr(pub)
...you'd do:
addr = pubtoaddr(pub,111)

I guess the upside would be that as well as the brand name (which you may not actually want) you'd get the existing registered users, including the ones with completed ID verification / AML compliance. Obviously this isn't going to be worth as much as the debt, but if you were able to get depositors to accept a haircut, you could start with no debt, and a bunch of deposits, which would be a very easy way to get a new exchange up to critical mass. In which case you come right out of the gate with a functioning, very liquid exchange with a bunch of customers who enjoy paying high fees.
Of course actually opening the exchange requires that you've resolved outstanding lawsuits, got the appropriate licenses for the jurisdiction you're in, made agreements banking partners (which Mt Gox couldn't do _before_ the collapse, good luck getting Japanese banks to work with you after it, especially after some twonk in Canada decided to sue Mizuho), and the small matter of actually building the exchange, since you presumably couldn't just fire up Mark's PHP code, home-made SSH server and all, and expect people to trust it with their money.
It feels like to make the thing work you really have to get everything ready to go before you start giving people their money back, because otherwise all the customers have all sodded off to other exchanges by the time you open. Since getting the new exchange running requires them to accomplish at least three impossible tasks before breakfast, you then have to wonder whether they're really going to be providing refunds at a faster speed than you'd get them for a liquidation, especially since the number they quote about liquidations in Japan taking 10 years is unsourced, and probably made up.

Unfortunately this is a limit in the protocol, so you won't be able to improve on it with a better wallet. The tricky thing about this is the network will let you create and fund transactions that you will never actually be able to spend. Hopefully the wallet will check this for you but you never know, and there are some slightless obscure factors affecting how many keys you can use like compressed vs uncompressed keys, so make sure you test what you intend to do with trivial sums first.
@_date: 2014-04-25 01:17:46
On the other hand the official government position seems to be that bitcoins aren't currency and Gox isn't a financial institution, so silly comparisons like "Market went bust in possession of local farmers' turnips" may actually be applicable here.

It says "supported" in the article but it seems like a bit of a stretch. Basically what seems to have happened is that the relevant LDP committee said to the local bitcoin entrepreneurs, "We don't want to deal with this, you guys go make a self-regulatory association or something", so they did.

The Japanese authorities are still being vague about how this is going to work, and the idea that sales _of_ bitcoins (as opposed to sales using bitcoins) will incur consumption tax is just speculation based on the fact that they're not a currency.
But even if you do have to pay tax on bitcoins, at a Gox-style exchange you're trading with another user not with Gox, so as long as that user isn't registered for consumption tax (which you don't have to do until two years after you do 10 million yen in domestic sales) there shouldn't be a liability, except on the Gox trading fee.
@_date: 2014-04-23 13:55:36
Their court filing had them spending Gox assets to build the exchange, which is rather mysterious considering they've been publicly telling the bitcoin community that the customer funds belong to the customers, which would imply that Gox doesn't have any assets to spend.
@_date: 2014-06-13 14:35:19
Not an expert in this and just thinking out loud, but maybe the other solution to this is if the capital cost of the equipment drops, and the main cost becomes the electricity rather than the hardware? If buying a standard electric heater is only a little bit cheaper than buying an electric heater that can mine bitcoins, your point about the ability to effectively use small amounts of heat kicks in and the distribution of hardware solves itself.
Obviously that's only half the problem because you still need to incentivize bitcoin-mining heater owners not to use big, centralized pools, but that seems a bit less intractable than the raw economies of scale involved financing, installing and operating expensive capital equipment.
@_date: 2014-01-13 04:21:56
We know how to do decentralized markets, but the interesting problem here is how to resolve the facts about what actually happened in a decentralized way so you can settle the bets. 
In theory it should be possible to use a proof-of-work chain to make the network reach a consensus about what happened and have the network settle the bets. Nodes would have an incentive to tell the truth because otherwise other nodes would reject their blocks. But this puts a lot more burden on the system of incentives for the miners to behave than bitcoin, where all the nodes have to do is timestamp things that anyone can trivially verify. It'll be interesting to see how the Princeton team do it.
The compromise solution is to have an authority (or a bunch of authorities, which you can combine for redundancy) publish keys saying which outcomes do and don't happen, but do all the contract trading peer-to-peer. The authorities don't need to know about the contracts, so they don't have the same kind of regulatory exposure as Intrade. They're basically the New York Times with electronic signatures under their articles. 
I've built one of these which I should be releasing this week; Hopefully people will then use those keys to build platforms where you can trade contracts that use them. The platforms could be full-blown dedicated p2p networks or something as simple as a system of hashtags on Twitter that allow you to offer bets, find bets other people are offering and create a multi-sig bitcoin transaction.

We've been a bit hesitant about this one at [Reality Keys]( as issuing keys for people's death enables some use-cases that we don't want to encourage like crowd-funded assassinations, but in theory if we can get good data sources for people's deaths we would like to start publishing keys for them.
If we do add deaths as a data source you would be able to:
1) Write a message (wills, letters etc) and encrypt it with our public key representing "You are dead", so that nobody will be able to read it until you die. (You may also want to timestamp this document by embedding the hash in the blockchain using a notarization service.)
2) Give bitcoins or other crypto-currency assets to somebody in a transaction that they can only spend if you're dead. (*)
If anyone's interested in this subject we discussed it at Epicenter Bitcoin last week: 
(*) If you're prepared to use "unable to use a computer" as a rough proxy for "dead", it's also possible to do something like this with a "dead man's handle" type of arrangement using time-locked transactions.
@_date: 2014-04-25 10:28:49
Bruce, since you've talked to these guys can you shed any light on the meaning of the plan the save gox guys filed with the court? 
What seems a bit mysterious is that although in public they seem to be adamant that the bitcoins are customer property and need to be returned to the customers in full, they apparently considered the *fiat* deposits to be Gox assets that they can spend building a shiny new exchange.
Aside from the issue of whether the fiat depositors are going to sue rather than let that happen and leave the bitcoins and everything else tied up in litigation for the next 20 years, have they advanced any legal justification for saying that while bitcoins are customer assets, customers' fiat deposits are Gox assets that Gox are at liberty to gamble with?
@_date: 2014-06-19 15:18:57
I don't know how far into the future you need but people have occasionally created Reality Keys facts asking whether 1 bitcoin will be worth at least 1 bitcoin at some future date. (Not sure if they were using us as a timelock or if they just screwed up...) So you could register one of those, we'd give you public keys for "yes" and "no", ignore the "no", and make a 2/2 multisig script with your public key plus the "yes". Once the date comes around, we'll release the private key for "yes" and you can unlock the money by combining that with your private key.
This isn't trustless because you have to trust us to release the key at the right time, but in theory you could combine it with other people doing the same thing. For example, provide 3 of your keys, get keys from 3 authorities and do 4/6 or 5/6. 
@_date: 2014-11-21 15:42:56
The most common multisig scripts (using P2SH) are made like this:
1) Get some public keys and combine them to make some specially-encoded conditions for spending the money (the "redeem script".) 
2) Hash the redeem script to make an address.
We're imagining that at least one of these public keys is yours, and you have the private key to it.
If you don't have the address from (2), and you don't have the public keys from (1), you won't even be able to find out that you have money in it to spend.
Even if you have the address from (2), if you don't have a record of the redeem script from (1) or a record of the public keys that you could use to recreate it, you won't be able to spend the money, despite having enough private keys for it.
Whatever process is used to gather some public keys and make an address needs to provide a way for the people who are going to spend the funds to keep a record of that redeem script, or else provide them with the public keys that were used to make it so they can recreate it.
@_date: 2014-09-12 05:35:23
It would be useful to have an extra feature for this, which is already in Viacoin (?) to allow you to do it without the oracle.
The issue is that nLockTime locks whether a transaction is allowed to get into a block, but until that time comes since it doesn't get into a block, the transaction can be double-spent by the person who created it. 
The alternative would be something like Peter Todd's 
[OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY]( which allows you to make a transaction, which gets into the blockchain immediately, but prevents its outputs from being spent until the specified time.

It would presumably cost more, but assuming you start by needing heat, and you're in an environment where it's not cost-effective to install something more efficient (for example heat pumps can heat quite efficiently, but they need piping, so I have a standalone electric heater too) the question is then whether cost of the ASIC heater compared to the traditional heater is more or less than the revenue you get from mining. There's some theoretical point where it is - no idea how far off that is...
@_date: 2014-06-13 10:35:11
Note that this envisages a single software implementation when the traditional proposal would be to have a bunch of fully independent oracles running separate systems, so it actually promotes a single point of failure where most people looking at this problem were working towards not having one.
The good thing about it is that in theory it allows us to get a decent number of oracles functioning quickly, which otherwise was going to take a while. Reality Keys was designed to be easily combined with other authorities, controlled at the user end with nobody needing to coordinate it, but at this point in time nobody else is actually running an easily compatible service.

If you pay taxes in USD and you lock in USD, there's no gain or loss because you still have the same amount of USD.
Basically what Eric is doing here is banking USD for you, except that:
1) You transfer money in and out in bitcoins.
2) He pretends he's running a bitcoin wallet not a traditional unregulated bank, which depending on the details of Panamanian law is either an incredibly clever regulatory arbitrage or a ridiculous scheme that will end up with everybody losing their money.
@_date: 2014-04-25 13:57:00
And like I say up-thread the savegox plan, as submitted to the court, requires even more legal cunning, because they need the bitcoins to be customer assets, but fiat deposits to be Gox assets. This is quite a tricky act to pull off, because normally whatever reasoning applies to the one would also apply to the other.
They need the former so that they can get the approval of a majority of creditors, who presumably mostly hold bitcoins and won't mind screwing people who hold fiat, and the latter so they've got somebody else's money to play with to pay themselves consulting fees and build a new exchange.

This may actually not be too bad, assuming the community cares enough to take countermeasures. GHash now has all kinds of expensive compliance costs, which means that were it not for their ability to prevent other miners from getting in, they would now be unable to compete in the marketplace.
The community now needs to escape their 51% tyranny for long enough to force them to have to compete, at which point they'll be dragged down by the need to carry a huge box-ticking regulatory apparatus. This may be doable just with independent miners switching over, but failing that developers can force the issue by switching the proof-of-work, which effectively sets everybody's existing ASIC gear on fire. From then on the danger of death by regulation will be clear, and nobody will want to go over 51% so we shouldn't need to repeat the process.
Obviously the danger here is if the community actually doesn't care enough about being censorship-free to go along with the proof-of-work switch, and just says, "benevolent mining monopoly, safe zero-confirmation transactions, cool!"...

Not really. Of the people who might know something:
  * Karpeles won't want to say anything that could potentially be used against him in legal proceedings.
  * The trustee will want to complete an investigation then make the whole thing available in one go, rather than trickling out unconfirmed stuff then putting out another statement contradicting it.
  * Ditto the police, in addition to which they won't want to publicize what they've found so far until they've finished questioning suspects, because they may be able to use the information asymmetry to get people to confess to things they wouldn't otherwise have confessed to.

Interesting angle coming out of this piece [Japanese], matching a suggestion yesterday by  on Twitter: Calling bitcoin a non-currency is a way of putting the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry in charge of it, instead of the Finance Ministry.

The protocol limits how much data (in bytes) you can put in a signature script, and a P2SH redeem script (which is part of the signature script) respectively. These limits are there to stop people attacking the network by making transactions that nodes have to exend too much effort validating. More detail here:

Bitcoin is a special case because needs a consensus, so arguably if it's going to have a bug, it's better that everybody has the same bug. 
Oracles are the opposite. The basic risk management principle here is that wherever there's a risk of failure, you want to avoid the failure being triggered by a common external stimulus. 
Unfortunately it's very common for people to overlook correlated risks like this. The example I brought up on the bitcointalk thread was the power for the cooling systems at Fukushima. They had three power lines and two generators, looked at the probability of each failing, and calculated that they'd get a melt-down every 21 million years. Unfortunately the tsunami that comes every 900 years did for all five redundant systems simultaneously...
I could also have mentioned the Lehman Shock, much of which also came from people failing to grasp the probability of many things failing at the same time for the same reason.
PS. I'm making this point now not because what you guys are doing is a bad thing - it's great to see an implementation, especially when there are so few - but just because if all your nodes do fail at the same time in the same way, I don't want people thinking that core model that the rest of us have been working towards, of a bunch of independent oracles being usable in combination to provide a very high degree of certainty - is broken.
@_date: 2014-01-13 04:01:50
The stock market is regulated. It's legal to gamble on stocks, but there are laws about how you have to do it.
The regulatory action against Intrade was for selling commodities futures. Again, it's legal to do this, but there are all kinds of laws regulating it the regulators thought Intrade were breaking.
Things like political bets are a bit of a grey area depending on the jurisdiction, but doing the thing in a decentralized way potentially makes a lot of problems go away.

I haven't looked at how they've implemented it but if done in a non-bonkers way then yes, you'd be able to check this.
A bigger problem is that the client you'll be using is running JavaScript that your browser fetches from their server every time you access their site. If they (or someone hacking their site) were to switch that for code that steals your private key or fails to generate it properly, that gives them just as much control over your funds as they'd have if you just gave them your funds. In theory you could check the code yourself every time your page refreshes, and presumably somebody would catch it if they started serving dodgy JavaScript on a massive scale, but it's hard to do in practice.

Credit cards aren't big in Japan, but I'd see this as a feature not a bug since they're expensive and often insecure.
Instead we have:
* Cheap, reasonably fast domestic bank transfer usable from ATMs or your computer.
* Very good e-cash systems.
* An excellent, reliable cash system: Not much street crime, so you can carry a lot around, and no bitching at you when you try to use a high-denomination note or whatever.
I'd say that the fact that the domestic payment systems are so good is one reason why bitcoin has had a hard time getting traction in Japan, even pre-Gox.

That's a great piece of work. It might be interesting to look at what legal issues might be involved, if any, with running an exchange in Japan on the bitcoins.de model. Japanese people will need to get their bitcoins from somewhere, and I doubt that the regulators will show the next MtGox the same attitude of benign indifference that they showed MtGox...

They don't have to do any of that. The hypothetical attacker (government or other) just needs to bribe or coerce 50%+1 of existing mining power. GHash have quite a chunk, so that would be a good start. Other miners (including botnets etc) are motivated by profit, and some of them would be prepared to apply the attacker's rules in exchange for a fee.

Even in an alternate universe where we trusted these people, it's not entirely up to them, is it?
The plan as you're describing it is to give the coins back in full but shaft the fiat holders by spending the fiat deposits on administration, litigation and building a new exchange. Being able to do this is based on a novel legal theory that you haven't been able to explain, whereby the fiat belongs to the corporation not the customers, but the coins belong to the customers not the corporation.
There's no way the fiat holders are just going to stand by and let this happen. They'll go straight to court and get an injunction preventing Sunlot from giving out the coins, on the basis that they have a claim on some of them, and the court needs to decide how many. This then gets followed by a long legal battle pending the outcome of which nobody can get anything out of Gox. 
This leaves you just as dependent on the Japanese legal system to get your money out as you would be with liquidation, but with more expense and complexity because instead of doing a normal bankruptcy based on established principles, you've thrown in a fascinating "what are bitcoins really" angle to keep Japanese legal scholars entertained arguing about 18th Century asset fungibility precedents for the next decade or two.

It's not obvious what Japanese law would prevent them from distributing the bitcoins to the bitcoin owners. It's quite common for liquidators to return people's property to them. For example, if a dry cleaner's goes bust, they open for a few days to let people collect their clothes. They don't sell all the clothes, then distribute the resulting money.

This could just be a question of applying existing laws about the responsibilities of payment processors to exclude known-criminal transactions to encourage miners to apply a blacklist. To date governments haven't tried to make the argument that miners are payment processors and need to be regulated like payment processors, but it's not obvious that courts would throw that argument out if they decided to make it.
There wouldn't be any particular egg on anyone's face if the attempt failed; They'd have done their job, which is to apply the law to try to make life harder for criminals...

I suppose it'll only be a little bit of help to them since they must already be using the randomness they can get to the browser (browser RNG + server RNG + keyboard/mouse interaction) to generate their private keys in the first place. If that's broken then I guess what happens when they sign is the least of their worries?
But as far as I can gather there doesn't seem to be any _downside_ to using a deterministic k value, except possibly that they might somehow screw up the implementation while fixing something that wasn't broken.
PS. The other benefit of a deterministic value here is that it's easier to test...

nTimeLock applies to the whole transaction, so you can't only timelock one of the outputs. But what you can do is make a transaction sending the funds to a 2/2 address, and have the other key holder sign a separate, time-locked transaction spending the output of the first transaction to the address you want and give it to you to keep. If you don't trust the other party you can insist on receiving the time-locked transaction before broadcasting the refund transaction.
There are a lot of protocols based on this kind of thing, although txid malleability potentially messes with some of them.

If I've got this right a compressed private key is the same as an uncompressed private key would be, except that before encoding it had a little flag tacked on to express the fact that when you use it, you want to use it to create a compressed public key. Hence the "compressed" private key actually being marginally longer than the "uncompressed" version.
The compressed public key is just a more efficient way of expressing the same information as the original uncompressed public key. However, when you make a bitcoin address, you do it by hashing your public key, so you end up with a different address depending on whether you use a compressed public key or not. Hence the need to keep track of which one you're using with the flag in the private key.

I didn't understand that -  consumption tax is a kind of sales tax. But there's a specific exemption for prepaid cards etc, which makes sense since you pay the tax on the thing you actually buy when you use them for payment, so if you taxed the prepaid cards as well you'd end up paying it twice.
If they can't think of an exemption applicable to bitcoin then I suppose they'll have to put a tax on the bitcoins as well as on the things you buy with bitcoins, but there are all kinds of ways to structure the transaction so you don't have to pay it so they won't end up collecting much.

Yup. We (Reality Keys) haven't set up a good data source for weather yet, but it's on the todo list.
BTW we play the most limited role we can and still let you get the job done, which is to produce a pair of public keys when you ask us (one yes and one no), then a private key when the result comes in (yes if the thing happened, no if it doesn't). That means you can put all your logic in your bitcoin transaction, and we don't need to know who A and B are or how much money they're staking.
PS. What would really help in the bitcoin context, without needing all kinds of amazing new features, would be simply broadening the range of standard transactions a bit, if only for P2SH. One thing people often want to do with our keys is something like "A + Yes-key OR B + No-key". The bitcoin scripting language handles that simply and elegantly, but then you have to kludge around sending it direct to Eligius to redeem it because the transaction is non-standard, or else force all kinds of unspeakable mathematical indignities on ECC keys to squeeze the thing into one of the standard patterns.

I don't see why it should be a multi-million dollar operation unless they get caught up in litigation. (See below.). And they'd probably have some other assets, like the customer lists, so they may end up paying out more than you'd get based on current stated assets and liabilities.
Sunlot like to quote numbers about Japanese bankruptcies only recovering 5% on average, but those will mostly be small businesses with hardly any assets.
The real issue here is whether they get tied up in litigation for decades amd the courts issue injunctions preventing a payout while everybody argues about it, but this is the same for both routes. If anything it's worse for the various rehabilitation wheezes.

I was thinking the other day that for small tips ChangeTip would work much better with probabilistic micro-payments.
So you'd send someone a 1 cent tip, and instead of getting 1 cent, which is going to cost more than 1 cent of their time to collect not to mention the transaction fee, they'd get a 1/1000 chance of getting $10, or a 1/10000 chance of getting $100.
You'd get part of the benefit from that by hacking this on top, so if you've got 1 cent in your ChangeTip account, you can send it on to the lottery address and it would send you back either nothing or a useful amount that was actually worth cashing out.

The trustee hasn't deemed anything anything yet, except for apparently deeming the various obviously-doomed proposals from Karpeles and "savegox" as obviously doomed.

I can't be sure without seeing the transaction but reading the thread it's not clear that blockchain.info is wrong.
I hope this doesn't mean blockchain.info stops relaying non-standard transactions for us and reporting on when it sees them, which would just kick the problem down the road to the next time the network starts to change its opinion of what a standard transaction looks like, which it will be doing very soon.

That's still what they're saying, although it's a bit vague. What's still unclear is whether you'll have to pay Consumption Tax on sales of actual bitcoins (as opposed to things bought with bitcoins) if you're a running Consumption-Tax-registered business. The logic of bitcoins being a thing not a currency would be that you would, but there are exceptions on things like prepaid cards explicitly designed to prevent double-taxation, so the Tax Office may decide to apply one of those. I doubt they actually want to tax bitcoin sales if they can find a legal justification not to - it would create work for them, and raise only a little more than zero, as everyone would just buy from (perfectly legally) unregistered sellers.

To be clear, Reality Keys isn't a prediction market. Reality Keys is a service that provides information about what happened in the world, in a way that makes it usable in bitcoin contracts. Think Bloomberg with cryptographic keys.
If you want to make a bet on an outcome like you would in a traditional prediction market, you'll need to find somebody who wants to be on the other side of the bet. Maybe you already know that person, because you ran into them on Reddit. I'm not sure what the legal situation is in the US - I suspect it varies from state to state, and depending on the subject matter, but it doesn't sound like the kind of thing individuals often get prosecuted for.
If you don't already have a counter-party you want to enter into the transaction with, you're going to have to find one somehow. There are all kinds of ways this might be done; Somebody might make a hashtag on Twitter and post their offer. Alternatively somebody could make a piece of software that created an order book with a p2p network. Or somebody could make a centralized site like Intrade to handle the order book. 
IANAL but it's possible that the regulatory exposure of someone running an Intrade equivalent but with user-to-user bitcoin contracts backed by Reality Keys would be similar to that of Intrade itself. (I guess it's also possible that they'd be a different kind of thing to Intrade in the eyes of the US regulators if they don't hold their users' money - not sure...) As I understand it they got into trouble for running an unlicensed futures exchange with respect to some small minority of their contracts (allegedly, it never went to court), and I wouldn't be surprised if you'd still be considered to be running an unlicensed futures exchange by the same logic even if you were only keeping an order book and matching up buyers and sellers, and buyers and sellers were concluding the contracts themselves, backed by reality keys. You'd have to be a bit braver than me (as predictious are) to run that kind of service for US customers, but at least with that arrangement if the exchange got shut down, its customers would still be able to conclude any outstanding bets and nobody would lose any money.

Trying to read something sensible into it, it could mean that if you're able to mine very efficiently you'll just keep growing your business until you have 51% of the network or close to it, which breaks the decentralization that's supposed to be the whole point of the system.
But judging by previous articles, it's more likely to be some kind of heroic misunderstanding about how mining rewards work, based on a sentence taken out of context from somewhere.

Yup. The sheer quantities of cash that move around are pretty mind-boggling. I had to handle the money at a funeral recently and was walking around with the equivalent of something like $20,000 in used bills.
On the other hand cash does actually work very well in Japan, and the domestic electronic payment systems are very good (cheap bank transfers, excellent digital cash systems). But like mobile phones there's a Galapagos effect where they have great Japan-only systems but they're not inter-operable with overseas stuff. That makes the Olympics an interesting hook.
@_date: 2014-04-26 01:55:24
IANAL but apparently some people are reading the Gox TOS as saying that they're customer property. I'm not sure whether or not putting that in the TOS would make it so, assuming the TOS really means that.
But again, if correct, this applies to both bitcoins and cash, in which case the recovery plan as put to the court is theft.

Actually there might be.
If you're a regular node in a p2p network you have no control over the transactions it carries, so you don't have to worry about AML and all those other regulatory headaches.
But what if you control over 50% of the network? Maybe you're a payment processor like PayPal. Are you in full regulatory compliance in all the jurisdictions whose transactions you process? If someone steals my bitcoins, can I go to court and get you to reverse the transaction? I'm not sure, but finding out could get expensive...

"I began investigation of the existing assets of the bankrupt entity, background behind the disappearance of BTC, etc. by delegating such work to Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu LLC and ReEx Accounting Firm. Such investigation still continues now and the completion date is undetermined as of today. In addition, when I am requested by a public institution to cooperate with the investigation, I am conducting possible cooperation."

Right, unless they find a couple of billion dollars down the back of the sofa it's hard to see how any plan like this could work. Until the recovery plan leaked and they declared bankruptcy they might still have been in with a hope of pulling it off, but now it seems a bit mysterious how they expect the court to buy it. Maybe the Sunlot people are getting strung along by their own lawyers...
If someone wants to wait until they liquidate the company and buy the exchange (customer lists, domains, PHP SSH server and all) to restart operations without inheriting the existing balances and the debt that would be a different thing, though. On balance it feels like the customer lists would create more value sold to a different exchange, but I suppose if you wanted to start a new exchange from scratch at this point it might be worth a shot. You'd certainly get plenty of publicity...

The more I think about this the more I think the main consideration has to be reducing the risk of more litigation. Whatever they do is going to upset somebody, so just do the most standard thing you possibly can, with as much Japanese legal precedent as you can, so that if anybody goes to court to get an injunction to stall the payout pending further arguments the court won't need to hesitate to tell them to piss off.
No funny rehabilitation plans, no Wall Street clevers, ignore the fact that you're at the centre of a global payments revolution and just make it all as traditional as possible. If necessary, just sell everything for yen and send everybody their money back through the legacy banking system.

It'll be interesting to see how the liquidators handle this, assuming they turn down the generous offer from the "savegox" people to spend everybody's deposits building a new exchange from scratch with non-existent banking partners while fighting off injunctions and lawsuits from all comers.
IIUC the standard pattern is to take a few months asking creditors to come forwards and state their claims to the money, then close the window and do the payout. Arguably they already know who the creditors are because their balances are in the database so they just need to enable withdrawals, minus a haircut. But you could also argue that the database may have been interfered with by either insiders or hackers, in which case it may not be reliable, and you'd have a case for requiring ID. If that happens, the actual claims could be quite a lot less than what they look like on paper.

For normal domestic commerce Japan has:
* Easy and safe option to carry and use cash.
* Good cash-on-delivery systems.
* Efficient, cheap online bank transfers. Within the same bank these are often free, and businesses will set up accounts with all the biggest banks.
* Cheap, efficient, simple electronic payment systems in shops.
I think the openings are:
* Online purchases directly from overseas sellers, or Japanese businesses selling directly to overseas customers.
* Embarassing / sketchy online purchases.
* Secret savings hidden from the tax man or your spouse.
These last two require easy, anonymous cash purchase of bitcoins. I think we could see shops that currently buy and sell gift vouchers and tickets doing this.

I think any of the following could out-compete bitcoin:
1) Anonymity (zerocoin?). It would start out being used for illegal/embarassing uses, then once established it would out-compete bitcoin for the rest.
2) Scalability. If you can make an alt-coin scale cheaper, possibly with a good sharding solution, you could start with micropayment uses that are too small to do in bitcoin, then get established and move up.
3) Exchange rate stability. Our Austrian friends aren't going to like this, but if you could peg to USD or some other asset, the market would prefer that for nearly all practical uses.

I don't really see why people think this. The Sunlot people were throwing some numbers around to this effect, but they seem to have been made up.
The previous thought was that if they end up selling all the bitcoins for yen that would tank the price, but seeing what happened with the Silk Road auction that doesn't seem to be a sure thing - it may actually raise more than the current market price...

The tradition I'm thinking of is "hesokuri", where a proportion of the money that the men hand over goes into the wife's secret stash.


If my mental arithmetic is right the total hidden in Japanese wives' hesokuri on those numbers looks about the same as the current total bitcoin valuation.
Likewise, husbands will want some unreported money that they don't have to hand over to their wives. A bonus paid in cash or bitcoins will be more motivating to a married male employee than a bonus paid into the bank account where it can be snaffled by the wife.

The Japanese says 換価, which can also mean things like "valued" or "appraised". This whole thing reads like a very generic description of the bankruptcy process, where the steps are basically, count up the assets, ask creditors to come forward, divide assets among creditors.

As you say if we published the wrong key for whatever reason we couldn't take it back, and the wrong person could get paid. It's possible we may screw up and do this, as our humans are only human and our bots are only bots. To mitigate this risk:
1) We provide a preview of the result we intend to publish before publishing the key, and give you some time (we default to a week but you can set it yourself) to object by paying a fee. This should make the final result fairly robust for any key that anybody cares enough about to pay the fee.
2) If you're using our keys for a bitcoin contract, you can require different combinations of keys. (This is a bitcoin feature, not a Reality Keys feature. We aren't involved in bitcoin contracts beyond publishing keys.) The obvious setup I'd envisage for a bet would be that you'd need two of three keys to spend, one for you, one for your counterparty and one for us. That would mean that you and your counterparty could settle without the reality key, and if we published the wrong key you could appeal to your counterparty's reputation.
But you may also want to add more layers. One might be competing service like ours, with its own keys for the same fact, another might be a more traditional general-purpose escrow / arbitration service, etc etc. You can combine as many keys as you like in whatever combinations you can get into transaction script. To extent that each layer is better than useless, this can allow you to reduce the risk as much as you like.

This is what we do at Reality Keys:
We like to talk about our service as a certificate authority for facts: We just produce keys about what happens, and we don't have to see or know about your contract at all.

I'm not sure that what they've announced will do that. 
They'll stop banks and registered securities firms from selling to consumers, but those guys probably weren't going to do that anyway. Meanwhile they've left the door open for securities firms to sell bitcoin-based funds, I guess like the Winkelvoss ETF.
They've said bitcoins don't have magical tax-eliminating powers and you still have to pay capital gains tax on your capital gains and sales tax on your sales, but we knew that already, and it's the same everywhere else.
They've said bitcoin is going to be regulated like a regular non-financial thing and that it doesn't fit any of the regulatory boxes they could have put it in, so you should be able to sell it person-to-person or in a shop without being licensed as a financial institution. And this puts it under the authority of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, who are lobbied by businesses and want to grow the economy, instead of the Finance Ministry, who are lobbied by incumbent banks and want to stop bad things happening.
There's a possibility that we'll end up with Consumption Tax (basically like EU VAT) being applied to sales _of_ bitcoins, which would be a PITA, but they haven't said that at this stage. The tax authority may be able to find a reason not to do that; Currently things like prepaid cards don't attract Consumption Tax to avoid double-taxation when you spend them, so maybe they can treat them like that. Even if they can't, there are workarounds; For example, if you buy on an exchange, you'd be buying from an individual, non-Consumption-Tax-paying seller, so the exchange would only have to collect the tax on the trading fee.

Right, if the creditors are funding the new exchange venture to the tune of 10 million dollars, why on earth would they only accept 16.5%?
The only reason this isn't being rejected out of hand by creditors is that some of them believe the claims Sunlot are making about a Japanese liquidation costing hundreds of millions of dollars to administer, which is thoroughly ridiculous.
The hitch in this otherwise brilliant plan is that they can't do anything without the permission of the liquidator, who will know how ridiculous their claims are and probably not particularly appreciate the way they're lying to the creditors about what he'd do.
@_date: 2014-06-15 02:04:10
Actually there are two things going on here. 
There's 2/3 multi-sig, which as you say would mean you'd only need 2 keys out of the 3. If this was a simple, old-fashioned multi-sig script you'd only need 2 private keys.
But nowadays most 2/3 multi-sig scripts are done using P2SH. An unspent P2SH transaction on the blockchain doesn't contain the script that's required to spend it (the "redeem script"), only the hash of the redeem script. You can't spend it without recreating the script that matches that hash, and recreating that script requires you know all the public keys that were used to create it, so the OP is safe, IIUC.
Obviously this assumes that the attacker really can't find out that third public key. If it's ever been used to spend a different transaction, it will be visible on the blockchain and the attacker may be able to get it.

Sure, but it's only the merchant whose details BitPay get, not the customer. 
It's a completely different setup to PayPal etc, which relies on the vendor and the customer both having accounts with the same intermediary. Because the customer doesn't need a relationship with BitPay, the vendor can switch to their competitor any time they like, or decide to handle the payments themselves. The customer doesn't even need to know about it.
The upshot is that even if BitPay and Coinbase are pressured to shut down a client, all the client loses is efficiency. This is totally different to the world where you can't get money without the intermediary.

Changing things and seeing what happens is pretty much the essence of the scientific method. Obviously it's not ideal to be experimenting on a multi-billion dollar economy, but there isn't really an alternative.
Also note that going ahead and hitting a hard limit is every bit as much of an experiment as raising the limit. This is clear from a lot of the arguments in favour of it, eg: "We need to develop a working fee market, and we think an over-capacity network will help" or "We think there may be some really great ways to do settlements without hitting the chain, and we need to enforce a capacity limit to get people to try them out".

I don't think the thing about 65% rep is right - it also depends on your assumptions about other people's assumptions.
In reality I think this thing potentially crumbles from the edge cases first. Start with an ambiguous case where the voters aren't sure which way to go. Put up a bribe, the undecideds take the bribe and the honest people get spanked. Now they're narked off and determined not to let that happen again, and you put up a bribe in a slightly less ambiguous case...
What they really want to do at this point is coordinate to make sure nobody cheats, but the system has a mechanism specifically designed to make to make it hard for them to coordinate...
It might be useful to build in a couple of other settlement mechanisms like m-of-n user-selected oracles and plain proof-of-stake voting (without the schelling clevers) and see which works better in practice...

But how do I know the record I found in the namecoin blockchain is really owned by foo.com?

Without getting into the overall merits of this, I wonder if the scorched-earth defence is generally practical for real-world vendors. I can see how it would help if you're trying to do zero-conf gambling or something, but if I was a vendor considering adopting this I'd be worried that:
1) I might burn payments due to double-spends that weren't intended maliciously. Say the customer makes a payment, then thinks maybe something somehow went wrong with the payment and they should do it again. Or maybe they decide they want to return the item, get their money back and cancel the deal. They bit-undo it - in the replace-by-fee world this is now a normal feature of bitcoin, not a sneaky hack - but my scorched-earth-enforcement computer doesn't yet know what they're doing. It doesn't have much time to find out because it has to scorch the earth before the bit-undo double-spending transaction gets into a block, so by the time the customer gets to the front of the queue holding the object they just bought, still unopened in the box, we've taken their money and destroyed it.
2) The resulting contractual situation might not work out in my favour. I've given them the goods and taken their money. If their double-spend had succeeded I'd have a claim against them for either the payment that they double-spent or the return of the goods, but when I scorched the earth, I made their original payment go through, then immediately blew the money on mining fees. It's now not obvious that they owe me anything; They've got their stuff, they've paid me the money, our transaction is completed and it sucks to be me.
Edit to add: Worse, for some goods in a lot of jurisdictions the failed double-spender has a legal right to return the goods and get a refund, and I have to repay them the money I've already burned...

(Before purse.io they apparently would buy gift certificates then send them overseas by snail mail...) This sounds plausible to me for small discounts, but 20%-30%???
Then today a Japanese user who'd been talking about getting 30% discounts said that they'd been scammed by seeing the thing disappear from their wish-list (and maybe getting a shipping confirmation?), then unlocking the bitcoins, only to see the order get cancelled before it was delivered.
I think you can avoid that scam just by waiting for delivery before unlocking the bitcoins, but maybe that's where these big discounts are coming from.

But some would collaborate, which reduces the proportion of mining power the attacker would need to coerce.

Potentially yes, some of the things you might do for more privacy would potentially cost you a bit more. But the status quo is the same things cost people running validating nodes a bit more. Charging people for the resources they use seems fairer - you can still get just as much privacy if you're prepared to pay for it


Disagree, it helps keep their costs down (although only at the margins, like block size) and generally makes bitcoin healthier, which is good for them to. To date there's been no history of miners resisting changes put into core that are generally helpful for bitcoin - if anything we've had the opposite problem: They seem to be very reluctant to change the defaults, even when the developers want them to.


Agree, this one is nuts. I mean, what if you had to make a change to stop bitcoin from breaking but some people were still opposed? To the extent that there's a point here it's that there may be a basic social contract based on what Satoshi originally announced he was making and people have reason to expect they'll get. That's a reason to go ahead and lift the cap. But if we know a load of stuff now that Satoshi didn't, his opinions way back when shouldn't be definitive.

Neither of those were easy. Indeterminate wasn't obvious at all in Iowa - results were announced by the party secretary, and the media were all carrying a Romney win, which is why Intrade settled Romney.
Specifying an exchange doesn't give you a meaningful bitcoin price, because you don't know which exchanges will be trading normally or even in business when you settle. If you had specified MtGox you'd then be arguing about when it became indeterminate whether they still had a meaningful price.
Reality is highly ambiguous and full of judgement calls, however carefully you try to phrase things.

There are a bunch of situations where:
1) Docking reputation will result in perverse incentives
2) Frustrating coordination (with the thing where you pre-announce the hash of your vote, and people can ding your reputation if they know the contents in advance, if I've got this mechanism right) prevents people from fixing the system if it gets wedged in the wrong place.
Apart from the attack scenarios, one example here is is what Vitalik called something like the "Mt Gox Problem": Everybody's looking at a particular data source to decide their votes, and it starts to diverge from reality. If you just did plain old PoS-weighted voting everybody would just switch to a better data source (since they're honest, and have a stake in the system working well), but you've gone and set up incentives so that they can't do that unless everybody else does it, which is now a coordination problem where people have incentives to pretend they're going to switch then not actually do it.
Obviously this requires 50%+ of the voters to be honest / enlightened-rational, but it looks to me like you may ultimately end up with that requirement in any case. (I think psztorc disagrees, for reasons that are apparently in his unpublished whitepaper.)
Anyhow there's clearly all kinds of original and experimental work here, so it seems worthwhile to make it a broad experiment...

It's called "extra_seed", which sounds like the developer probably intended that it would be xored it with the android-generated one, but then ~~it looks like they just over-write the original seed instead~~ who knows what happens - see end of post.
Set the extra seed here:
Then use it here:
If you look at the Java docs it has a bunch of big warnings about how dangerous it is to specify your own seed, so this probably isn't the first developer who's made this mistake.
Edit to add: Looking at the Java docs again it says it "*may* completely replace the cryptographically strong default seed", not "*will* completely replace" So maybe this behaviour depends on your Android version or something?
Edit again: Yup, here it is, changed in Android 4.2.

This isn't right, they can set obviously their own size limit for incoming blocks. You can't force somebody to mine on top of your block.
To the extent that I can make sense of the argument it's that a fast-connected majority would use big blocks on purpose to do the equivalent of selfish mining, at the expense of slow-connected miners.

Those aren't practical in all situations. For example, I have a gas stove in my living room plumbed into the gas system, and heat pumps in a couple of the rooms with piping to units outside. But when I want some extra heat wherever I am, I use a standalone electric stove. This is cheaper than fitting extra heat pumps or a load of extra piping to shift the heat around the house.
In this situation, if the electric stove could also mine bitcoins, those bitcoins would effectively be mined for free. 
@_date: 2014-06-14 00:25:50
Short-term maybe, but in terms of the core economics of this thing, running your ASIC is just another way of turning electricity into heat, so if you already need that heat - and as says the need for heat is well distributed - the electricity for mining your bitcoins is effectively free, since you'd have needed to burn it even if you hadn't been mining bitcoins. No matter how good a deal they may have cut with their utility, a dedicated operator won't be getting their electricity for free.
The problem with this stuff right now is that because the capital equipment is very expensive relative to the electricity, you have an advantage if you're able to finance, install and run it very efficiently, and it's more efficient to do that stuff at scale. In theory you'd expect the cost of this equipment to gradually decline over time, until at some point the capital equipment becomes so cheap relative to the electricity cost that the economies of scale don't make a difference any more.
I think the upshot of this is that ultimately we may be better with something that's very simple and cheap to build and letting technological progress work in our favour, rather than trying to build ever more ASIC-resistant proof-of-work schemes and always running from better technology, with very serious consequences if technology catches up.

You'd probably also put a sensible default in the software and allow miners to over-ride it. That way the network would only accept the monster block if 51% of miners deliberately decided they wanted to break things, and the network is doomed under those conditions anyhow.

Right, that was in Mike Hearn's video. I don't think you'd need a service like ours; The property ownership would be somehow encoded in the blockchain, and the car would check the blockchain itself directly. I guess you could handle the ownership with [Colored Coins]( or similar, so if you're a loan shark who lends money with cars as collateral you could do it, but you'd need to make some kind of modification to the car.
I think the practicalities of this kind of arrangement are going to be tricky, and it won't be very useful in practice while the bitcoin exchange rate is so volatile. Maybe you can do something clever to fix the latter using currency futures...
BTW I think the obvious place to do this stuff would be with _digital_ assets, where you really could write a license for software or copyrighted material with the effect that if you didn't have the right record on the blockchain, you didn't own the asset. If it was software on a computer it could then disable itself, and if it was a graphic on a website somebody would run a bot that spidered your website discovered you were using it without a license then sent you a nastygram.

Again, even in a censorship situation it's not clear that relaying nodes matter. Even if someone managed to censor all the relaying nodes you'd just send your tx directly to any remaining non-censored miners, and if 51% of miners are enforcing blacklists then it won't help you even if you've connected all the ants in the world to the internet and genetically modified them to relay blocks.

Note that this is nearly all paying for proof of work not actual transaction handling. The necessary proof of work is in turn proportional to the value of the assets it's protecting, not the number of times they're moved around. So if you increased the number of transactions 100x, the cost per transaction would drop to (nearly) 1% of what it is now (except to the extent that doing this made bitcoins more valuable, which would feed back into total mining cost).
Put another way, bitcoin is a ludicrously expensive may to move money *unless you scale it up really big*.

I'm pretty sure they'll end up not imposing VAT. 
Firstly, it's the logical upshot of the recent proposal to change the law to admit that bitcoins are money, not turnips.
Secondly, imposing VAT on bitcoin sales will cause a lot of admin work for businesses and the tax authorities, but won't raise much money. It may actually end up _reducing_ the total tax take. 
The idea of VAT is that you pay it every time you add some value. So if a farmer buys some fertilizer and seeds, then grows some turnips which he sells, he pays tax on the price of the turnips minus the amount he spent on the fertilizer and the seeds. Then when the shop buys the turnips and sells them to a housewife, they pay tax on the difference between the price they sold them to the housewife for and the price they paid for the farmer. But because bitcoins are money not turnips, there's no value added. I sell you a bitcoin and hold onto it for a while, then sell it to someone else, but in the meantime I haven't polished it or done anything to make it more valuable. So if everyone is a VAT taxpayer, the seller gives the government VAT, but then the buyers deduct it from their VAT bill.
@_date: 2015-05-31 12:38:29
I may be wrong, butI'm not sure that Satoshi thought we'd need lots of full nodes out there just relaying things. 
I mean, where you actually need to trust the data you have miners who have to do proof-of-work so you're protected against people sybil-attacking you, and obviously the servers you're getting SPV transactions from need to be running full nodes, and if you want ultimate protection without having to trust anyone you'll want to run a full node yourself. Then obviously you need to get your blocks from somewhere, but that seems OK right now, and if it becomes hard then people would pay for what they needed. So what's the problem bitcoin should have solved by incentivizing nodes?

Can someone post the hex of the TX so we can see what you're talking about? Is it actually invalid, or is it just a non-standard transaction that may or may not be mined?

Hate to be picky but this would be better phrased as "trading while insolvent".
The point of a fractional reserve is that the your depositors' money is loaned out to somebody else, so you've got a valuable asset (the right to the money you're owed) but you just can't get hold of it right now because it's going to take some time to get back the value of the loan. This doesn't apply to Gox because they weren't in the business of making loans. They had a bunch of customer USD and a bunch of customer bitcoins and they were supposed to all be there.
If it had just been a fractional reserve then although he wouldn't have been able to pay out if everybody asked for their money simultaneously, the bankruptcy trustee would ultimately be able to sell off assets (loans or whatever) and give everybody their money back.
@_date: 2015-01-14 23:18:12
Tee hee. Sadly they've lost both a proportion of their bitcoins and (rather mysteriously, in a way that still hasn't been adequately explained) also cash from their bank account, so unless the trustee has already sold off bitcoins they won't be solvent at any price.
A while back when Sunlot were trying to push their recovery plan a bunch of the depositors were upset that the trustee wanted to convert the remaining bitcoins to yen then sit on them for a while before paying them out, which they thought would cost them the gains they were expecting from their bitcoins appreciating in the mean time...

I'm still tinkering around with the UI on this so it's not quite ready for prime time but people might be interested in this app I've been working on to do smart contracts with your future self:
Basically the idea is that you set a goal for yourself (say run 10km by Friday) that can be verified by some public API - we're set up to use RunKeeper - and choose a charity. If you complete the goal, your money goes back to you, but if you don't it goes to charity. This uses [Reality Keys] ( (which I run) to check the API and provide a key that allows you to release the money.
You can also have other people chip in to sponsor you, instead of funding it all yourself. It would also be fairly easy to switch the other way around and turn it into a sponsored walk or whatever, where somebody else funds the transaction, and if you complete the challenge the money goes to charity but if you don't it goes back to the funder.
I think there are quite a lot of interesting variations on this theme - feel free to fork the code. Also if anyone needs another API added so they can do something other than RunKeeper then let me know. I'm not sure if anyone currently provides a public "Did I stick an ice cube in my ass" API - maybe try talking to [Withings](

That's exactly what they're changing. They're going to change the law so that bitcoin is considered a currency not a commodity.
 


AFAIK they haven't yet specifically said this will change, but it's the logical upshot of it being a currency not a commodity, and I'm pretty sure they will change it. They're probably not getting much money by levying the consumption tax, since a tax on added value and there's no value added from moving bitcoins around, and it's easy to avoid by "importing" your bitcoins.

The way I'm imagining the OP's use-case they wany to time-lock some funds and have people be able to verify that they can't be spent until Date X. If that's the goal it's not enough to make a time-locked transaction, you also have to prove that you can't use the keys you used to make the time-locked transaction to make another, non-timelocked transaction. If there are other people involved then maybe they can hold some of the keys used to create the timelocked transaction so the OP never has them, but we'd need to know a bit more about the situation to tell if that's feasible.

That's the part that decides whether it's valid. You absolutely care about that, and your software needs to be able to check whether it's valid.


This is my point, every node has to upgrade or they can't verify the transactions they receive. 
This is not, by any stretch of the imagination, opt-in. It's a forced upgrade. You have to do it or you can't verify.
If you had a new address format it would sort-of be opt-in because you could publish a segwit-payable address to signal that you knew how to verify segwit, and people who didn't would continue only receiving payments that they knew how to verify. But that also has downsides, which are discussed upthread.
@_date: 2016-01-18 22:39:39
If the address I give to the payer doesn't indicate whether I'm willing to accept Segwit transactions then all the stuff about this upgrade being "opt-in" rather than forced on you with a hard fork is a bit ridiculous, isn't it? 
If you're going to get paid in bitcoin people are sometimes going to make their payments using SegWit, and any code that checks whether a transaction is valid is going to have to be updated.

That would be the right question if all miners only ran the software you gave them and validated where and when you think they should validate, but in practice it's not in their interests to do this, and won't be unless block propagation time is near-as-dammit to zero, which isn't a realistic goal.
Since they don't and won't do what you want them to do, the question is whether to make a proper implementation with a reasonable validation timeout or let the miners do this themselves and bollocks it up.

So the solution is to bribe a (weighted) majority, so you're in line with the consensus. At that point the system helps you by dinging the reputations of anyone who continues to tell the truth.
Then once you've proved you can move the consensus the next trick is to say that the bribe only gets paid if less than (say) 80% vote your way. People still have to vote the way you want to avoid losing reputation, but it doesn't cost you anything...

The problem there was that they weren't validating with a timeout. If they'd been following Gavin's approach here and giving up on blocks if they hadn't validated them in 30 seconds then the invalid fork would have been orphaned almost immediately. (Come to think of it, IIRC in that case even validating the headers properly would have stopped it.)
BTW, I remember way back when on the dev list someone - I think it was Sergio Lerner - was advocating that Core should implement this, because if they didn't the miners would do it themselves, and bollocks it up. Core blew him off, and the miners did it themselves and bollocksed it up.

I don't think it's safe to assume that miners' opinions on this are different from the opinions of users in general. You get that impression reading r/bitcoin, but for various reasons a significant cross-section of users don't post here much or at all. My non-scientific impression from bitcoin meetups is that the opinion there is quite different from opinion in this reddit (although may be some local exceptions - for example SF seems very small-blockist.)
That said, we should certainly be prepared to hard-fork if the miners misbehave. This actually helps protect the miners, too. For example, if the Chinese government start leaning on them to censor utxos belonging to Uighur separatists, it would be useful if they could say, "there's no point, the network will work around us", and if necessary, actually prove it.

This soft fork would be controversial so it's hard to see it activating on the post-Gavin controversy rules.
However the other thing we can do here if people want to use it is bond or insure a trusted party in a token on the sidechain. For example, we (Reality Keys) could give you keys or nonces of hashes revealed based on the data in Ethereum contracts. An insurance contract on Ethereum would allow you to trustlessly insure against us releasing the wrong keys or failing to release either. Your insurance would be in Ether or Digix Gold or whatever so you'd have the risk of that dropping compared to the bitcoins it was insuring, but if it did you could always top up, and even if the insuring token completely failed you'd still have the trusted service we offer now.
If anyone is interested in using this let us know; It would be easy for us to add and I'm quite keen to try out "sell insurance against your own failure" as a business model. But TBH I'm a little bit skeptical that people really want to use bitcoin as currency so much that they'll to to the trouble of handling these pegs, rather than just selling their bitcoins and buying the native token of the chain that has the features they want.

Sure there is, the community hard-forks to a new chain with the malicious stakers' stakes deleted. This is a much better response than the PoW version of changing hash algorithms, because it's definitely hugely expensive to the stakers, whereas it's quite plausible that making everybody change their mining hardware could actually be *profitable* to the attacker in some cases, such as the case where the largest miner also happen to be the leading mining hardware manufacturer...
@_date: 2018-06-26 14:00:52


Modern PoS designs generally lock up the stake for a while, so it can't circulate before you have time to respond. There's no economic damage if the malicious nature of the action is clear; You're taking coins out of circulation, increasing the value of the remaining ones.


A market leader might win in two ways: First, they're more advanced and faster to market, so unlike SHA256, which is simple and now has a lot of competition, they may well have a period when they were the only vendor in town. Secondly, all their existing customers would need to buy new hardware. Lots of vendors use planned obsolescence to make more money, and if consumers didn't know it was coming that's even better.
Also in this scenario they're the attacker, so they get to pick the timing; They could run down their inventory in advance and build up their product development team ready for the new algorithm, while their competitors were building up inventory, putting all their resources into the 
next generation of SHA256, etc etc.
Whether this *would* happen I don't know. Nobody knows, it depends on all kinds of factors. And Jihan seems like a nice guy who means well, I doubt that he'd do it. But what we do know is that the mechanism for punishing bad PoW miners is quite indirect and may well be counter-productive, whereas the mechanism for punishing bad PoS stakers is dead simple and very direct.

I think it will happen. Bitcoin is pretty much perfectly designed for a cartel. 51% of the incumbents can set a bunch of rules and freeze out anyone who doesn't abide by them. They have strong economic incentives to do this, but they will also have no problem coming up with a justification about how this will be better for bitcoin. It will also allow them to use much more efficient pricing strategies than a dumb block size production quota, which turns away a lot of business while leaving a lot of the consumer surplus with the consumer.
I think this will get me down-voted but a not-entirely-sarcastic thought experiment: Maybe we should apply the logic that's used to justify full-replace-by-fee and say that since it's in miners' economic interests to do this, we should assume they're going to do it and embrace a bitcoin controlled by a cartel. The community could do a lot to shape what *kind* of cartel - for example, it could be an open organization setting rules by blockchain voting - you could think of it as a bitcoin-mining DAC and excommunicating people who censor transactions.

Kind-of, but it seems reasonable to think that someone would have mentioned it if there had been an invalid transaction a few months back and everyone had just kept building on it.

There's a proof-of-stake voting system where you get rewarded for voting in line with the consensus. (Rather confusingly their coin is called "reputation", but it walks and talks like a coin.) The idea is that like with bitcoin mining, you have a general enlightened-rational incentive not to break the system and destroy the value of your coins, combined with a narrowly-self-interested incentive to vote the way everyone else, votes, which is hopefully the truth.


I think you're right that the ambiguous cases are where it starts to break down. They have a thing called "indeterminate" if an outcome is ambiguous, so the way to break it will be to come up with a reason for ambiguity, then put up a bribe for an indeterminate vote. Once you've shown you can move a borderline case, rational voters will start to take the bribes into account when guessing what everyone else will do, so the bribe will work to oveturn progressively more clear-cut cases...
That said, I suspect good, old-fashioned honesty by a certain proportion of voters will be enough to keep this thing on the rails.

Good question, this says if everyone had used Schnorr to date it would have been a 25% reduction in storage and bandwidth. It may then be bigger in future because people are doing more multisig than they used to, and Schnorr is great for multisig.
However, IIUC this is a reduction in the witness part not the main transaction part, and that's already discounted 4x in Segwit, so you don't get much increase in total capacity by shrinking the signatures. In turn, since the performance gain per transaction is small, that will also make the incentive for adoption small (although there are also some other benefits). 
So there's very little capacity increase as far as I can tell, but hopefully someone will correct me.
@_date: 2015-08-03 01:56:47
Well sure, it probably won't happen. And if it did happen, it's not yet game over: It may be possible to deploy more hashpower elsewhere, maybe subsidized by donations from people who care about the system or companies that want to preserve it. Also once the Chinese government is doing geopolitics by controlling hashpower, maybe other countries step in to try to redress the balance and free the Tibetan bitcoins...
Failing that, bitcoin would probably fall back on IRC chatroom consensus and start checkpointing, which would be ugly, but if you successfully checkpoint your way through the attack you remove the incentive to do it again.
But it's a very serious risk.
@_date: 2015-08-13 01:59:07
Yes, it's possible. The public keys should already be in the transaction, and you should be able to either recover them directly from the signatures or (if your library doesn't have a handy way to do that) test-validate each of the signatures against each of the public keys until you find one that matches.
You might like to look at pybitcointools, and particularly the content of ecdsa_tx_recover:

In fairness when it was implemented there were quite a few regular users running full nodes purely because they wanted to use bitcoin for buying things, and these people weren't interested in being auditors for the network. These people were also hard to reach to get them to upgrade. Since SPV wallets the situation has reversed, and the people running full nodes explicitly care about auditing, and these are the people most able to find out about and respond to a change.
I think there's a kind of folk memory about the difficulty of hard forks from that time, and people who don't want the block size to go up are using it as a peg to hang FUD on.

@_date: 2015-08-02 22:38:47
I'm not sure what f2pool have said about doubling, and BIP101 doubles every two years not every year. Either way, hash rate share is very dynamic. It wasn't long ago that everyone was worried about GHash getting 51%, and now they hardly even feature. So the current opinions of current miners aren't as big a deal as they might sound.
That said, 75% for a non-core fork is a very heavy lift. A lot of them probably just won't want to get involved, and the default "not involved" position is to keep running core unless the rest of the network votes for XT.
I suspect the difficult bit here will actually be getting 51%. Once that happens (if that happens) there's a bit of social pressure to go along with the majority, and minority miners may start to worry that the majority will gang up on them and start orphaning unupgraded blocks...

Nobody's come up with any additional incentives to cartel/co-locate/centralize. The network will be able to share transactions fine, and to the extent that the code to do this isn't done yet SPV mining works fine as well, at least unless you do something radical to jack the fees up compared to the block reward so that mining an empty block for a few seconds costs you serious money.
What's being suggested is some mechanisms by which that cartel could be implemented in the presence of bigger blocks, but those mechanisms are less effective than other mechanisms that are already available.
@_date: 2015-08-06 00:20:55
They can do this and it will probably work fine. However, there are objections from two directions:
1) The policy about what should be ignored isn't coordinated, so people apply different policies about what to reject and as described you risk getting very long forks, which means you need to wait for more confirmations to know your payment isn't going to get reversed.
2) The coordination works too well, and miners start setting other policies in a way that we'd prefer them not to. (They can do this anyway, but I guess the argument would be that once they're incentivized to set up a mechanism for this, they'll go on to use it for other things.)

Are we allowed to answer this here? Let me talk about the pre-big-blocks version of XT, before it became what the mods consider taboo.
XT was good because it helps people to run useful code that isn't in Core as part of a stable, maintained piece of software, rather than having to apply the patches themselves and keep them in sync on upgrades.
Having in charge of it has the added benefit that since a non-trivial number of people are trying to prove that the maintainer is working for the CIA, it gets carefully scrutinized for code that doesn't do what the maintainer says it does.

The current status is:
* Core have made it pretty clear they're not going to merge a block size increase any time soon, if ever. I say "if ever" because even if some of the individuals currently opposed flip to support an actual proposal on the merits, they've dug in against any "controversial" change, and there's no conceivable change to this that wouldn't be controversial.
* The current production version of XT doesn't support bigger blocks.
* There's a development version of XT available which does support bigger blocks, two weeks after 75% of miners upgrade to it, next year at the earliest. Some individuals have been installing this to show support, but this doesn't make any practical difference in the absence of miners hitting the threshold.
* Some miners have started putting messages in their blocks to the effect that they advocate 8MB blocks. However, it's not clear whether this means that they'd run XT, or just that they think Core should move on this. Previously some of them seemed to be saying they wouldn't run XT and would stick with Core, but that was when some people were still talking like Core would move and just needed more time to work on proposals and build consensus, which now seems to have been effectively ruled out unless someone comes up with a special new definition of "uncontroversial".

In the real world people have sufficient trust in their datacenter operators. Especially for a case like this where everything that happens is public and the network is already designed to support a certain proportion of abusive mining nodes, so if a datacenter operator misbehaves you can move somewhere else.

IANAL and I haven't seen the judgement but I'm going to explain what I think this case was about, because it's a complex combination of law and metaphysics written up by a Japanese journalist who probably didn't understand it, then paraphrased by an English-language site and then summarized by a different English-language site, so your chances of figuring it out from the CoinDesk piece are not good.
Gox has some bitcoins and some cash, and owes some bitcoins and some cash. A while ago there was a discussion here about what whether that should all go in a single pool and everyone get paid in proportion to what they lost, or whether the bitcoins should be split among bitcoin creditors and the cash among cash creditors, or the bitcoins traced back based on who paid them in and some lucky people get all their bitcoins and some get none, or what.
If you imagine a dry cleaner's had gone bankrupt with a bunch of people's clothes, those clothes still belong to the original owners. So the bankruptcy trustee tasked with dealing with the mess would probably ask people with clothes there for cleaning to come and collect their own clothes, then sell any remaining assets and divide them up against the normal creditors. What they wouldn't do would be to sell all the clothes, assign the cash value of their clothes to the owners and pay the owners in proportion to the remaining assets.
On the other hand, if a bank goes bankrupt, money is completely liquid and fungible, so even if you could prove that they still had _your_ $10 note, and they'd lost somebody else's, you wouldn't get any special treatment; If the bank only had 20% of the assets they owed, you'd only get $2 back.
So this unlucky Japanese court has been lumbered with deciding whether the bitcoins at Gox are like dry cleaning or like cash in a bank. Until now the Japanese government had been saying (based on their interpretation of the law) that bitcoins were "things" rather than money, which made it sound it like the dry cleaning interpretation may apply. But this court seems to have said that no, you don't have particular ownership over particular bitcoins held at Gox, so the bankruptcy trustee can carry on doing what he seems to be doing and give all the bitcoins a cash value (I'm not sure if this will involve selling them or not) then paying all the creditors out pro rata.
I don't know what the legal reasoning is but this seems like the fairest way to do it.

I don't think I agree with this. Large mining share is fine as long as it isn't abused, and abuse would be obvious. The problem is what you would do if they did abuse it, for example by trying to censor transactions. If they own their own hardware then we're a bit screwed, but if their hashpower comes from people all over the world then it can be revoked as easily as it was granted.
If anything I think it's better for alert solo miners to carry on using these pools, because it increases the amount they have to lose if they try to censor transactions or play other kinds of silly-buggers.
Unfortunately IIUC the pools that bollocksed up a mining optimization and caused the BIP66 fork were mostly using their own hardware. (Which partly explains it: I guess their expertise is hardware, not software...)

That's relevant if we're talking about whether it's in miners' interests to make their blocks propagate slowly on purpose, which is a claim some people have made, but apart from that miners are going to make sure their mempools are close to entirely synchronised, no? The miner who makes the block wants everybody to have their transactions already to reduce the risk of getting orphaned, and the miner that gets it wants to have their transactions already so that they can mine blocks with fees on top of it asap. 
This may mean some changes to the way their nodes work, because if you see a transaction you'd reject but other people often wouldn't you want to keep it in around case somebody mines it instead of just throwing it away, but miners are incentivised to do that if they usually throw away a lot of transactions that other people usually mine. (I doubt they do, with a couple of funny exceptions the policies seem pretty standard.)

Yup, that's what would happen assuming the various methods of getting transactions before they're included in a block don't work, either for technical reasons or because the miners producing the blocks decide that it's in their interests to sabotage them. And that's not particularly bad, as long as it's done with a reasonable timeout, which is the most profitable way to do it.
One of the many weird things about this debate is that when you take into account what's actually happening in the real world, like headers-first mining, a lot of people's positions are the reverse of what they should be. The only thing you lose during the period when you're mining on headers compared to having the full block is fee income, but keeping blocks small is supposed to substantially *increase* fees. If you increase the proportion of miners' revenue that comes from fees, you increase the competitive advantage that's supposed to come from getting the full block quickly, which is the exact opposite of the stated goal.

Purely speculating here but if there are really legal issues about paying bitcoins, the obvious thing to do since they're working with Kraken would be to sell the bitcoins to/via Kraken then credit people with a yen balance at Kraken, which people who wanted bitcoins could then use to buy bitcoins back. Since Kraken are already administering the bitcoins this would be the same in practice as just giving the bitcoins back.

The winner will be the one with the longest chain. SPV wallets use this automatically Since the big block rules don't kick off until it has 75%, that will be the big block fork, if there's a fork.
At that point it's likely that mining of the small-block fork will grind to a halt. If some people still want to run it and it makes it to the next difficulty adjustment, small-block SPV clients will need a checkpoint embedded to prevent them from using the big-block chain. But the small-block chain will probably want to change the proof-of-work function as well, to avoid being attacked by miners from the big-block chain.

Yes, it's profitable because as you have to burn money to create an invalid block you hardly ever see one. Even if it only takes you 0.6 seconds to download and validate a block, that's 0.6/(60*10) = 0.1% of your time wasted mining a block that will probably be orphaned. The number of invalid blocks out there is well below 0.1%, so assuming it's valid until you have a chance to determine it's invalid is always going to be a more profitable strategy (at least until you count the dev time to get it set up).
PS. Apparently these guys were taking an even bigger short-cut than normal SPV mining because they weren't even checking the header, but the incentives for doing it right are the same.

Assuming for the sake of argument that this is correct, if they wanted to do this isn't it easier to just collude? I mean, the three biggest pools are already colluding to make a shared policy document, they could just agree to prioritize each others' blocks. If you've got three guys in a cartel that helps all three of you nobody's going to break it. So why bother with all this palava with big blocks that temporarily depresses their own profitability?

A more promising approach is to target something naturally emerging like the orphan rate. I think there was some talk of doing that with Ethereum (although I guess it's easier for them to track the orphan rate for them than it is for bitcoin, since losing blocks play a role in their system rather than getting thrown away and forgotten about like in Bitcoin.)

~~You can get it going faster by downloading the bootstrap.dat. That way you don't have to validate years' worth of the entire world's transactions, and you can just start validating from a recent date.
Edit: Don't listen to me, see post below.
That said, and without wanting to discourage you from running your own node and validating yourself, SPV wallets are fine for most practical purposes. Given how many ways there are for you to lose your bitcoins, the chances of losing them to an invalid block or something else that Core would help you with must be pretty slim.

PS What you'd probably do in practice is a bit more subtle - for example, if you've got a block that probably hasn't propagated to a large part of the network, then you see another block at the same height, you use that in preference. All the honest majority needs to do here to prevent abuse is nudge the scales a bit, since the advantage the attacker is trying to get only exists at the margins, if it even exists at all.
@_date: 2015-08-04 07:24:20
How does this stand up to:
* IBLTs or similar meaning the other miners already have the transactions in the block, so it propagates fast even if it's big
* Everybody doing the profitable thing and mining empty blocks top of the previous block until they've had time to download and validate it (or up to a timeout, hopefully) so the fact that a block hasn't propagated doesn't prevent other miners from mining on it
@_date: 2015-08-03 00:10:56
Disagree: The block size connection is all bullshit, but this is a very serious risk to bitcoin. A single, authoritarian government has the ability to control 51% of hash power. This is very, very bad.
For example, say Tibetan or Uighur activists have a bunch of bitcoins in a known address. China tells the biggest pools that anyone who mines on top of a block spending those coins is in trouble, and the pools stop including transactions that spend those coins, and orphan any block that does. A bitcoin where this happens is very badly broken, and it may take as little as 3 phone calls...
@_date: 2015-08-05 23:44:06
Sorry, I see what you're getting at. It's true that you could reduce costs by idling, but like you say a lot of miners' costs are fixed (hardware capital cost, datacenter space etc) so it wouldn't normally be enough of a saving to make up for the loss of revenue. 
Mining on the header brings in nearly as much revenue as mining on a validated block: All you lose is the occasional orphan from an invalid block, and fees for the transactions you'd like to have included. But there usually won't be many of those, because the most attractive transactions of all but the last few seconds will already be in the block you're validating.

BIP 66 was a rare example of a non-controversial fork. (Arguably a bit of controversy would have been helpful, since it turned out a bunch of miners hadn't heard about it, which made the roll-out less smooth than it could have been.)

There are people out there who have put a lot more thought into this than I have but this is a really interesting piece:
What I understand from it (may be wrong) is that you can make proof-of-stake work, but you don't have the benefit of being able to use an automated, trust-free way to work out the right chain at any time. You have to get a checkpoint from somebody. However, it may be that all the mechanisms for doing this are too easily subverted for the (very strong) censorship resistance that you're aiming for, whereas it's more practical for a community trading on Tor to ask the people you're trading with and work out what checkpoint you should be using.
Does that make sense? Like I say I'm not at all confident that I understand this stuff properly...

No, if this thing works as described it'll be great for small transactions and fast transactions, and "small, international and fast" isn't really addressed by any existing solution so this would be a huge win. Once the infrastructure is working, if it's as good as claimed it will be able to take over some of the existing on-chain use-cases as well.
As far as the relationship with bitcoin 2.0 goes, what would be really helpful for 2.0 would be if bitcoin were to price out its current digital cash users and send them off to Ethereum or some other system with better smart contract functionality. Bitcoin is currently protected by a network effect, but if you price people out of your network you don't get to choose where they go instead. And the bitcoin processors aren't just going to give up if bitcoin becomes expensive or unreliable. Bitpay could make all their customers' "Pay with bitcoin" pages into "Pay with bitcoin or ethereum" in a matter of weeks.

Then there are two weeks during which a non-zero proportion of the remaining 25% - probably the vast majority - switch over, so the attacker just triggered the fork.

This is moot here since I was wrong about how bootstrap.dat works but the practical security downside of an SPV wallet compared to a full node is that if someone publishes an invalid block, it may be a while until you know it's invalid, especially if other miners decide to build on it.
@_date: 2015-08-04 21:49:43
That's always going to be the most profitable strategy as long as validation time is greater than zero and invalid blocks are rare. Done right it's also good for the network, because it reduces the orphan rate of the honest chain and increases the cost of 51%-attacking it. But this doesn't tell you that it's a good idea to make your own blocks propagate slowly, or that the best way to make them propagate slowly is to make them big.
That said, I wish people doing simulations would simulate what the network is actually incentivised to do and much of it has long since been doing, rather than what bitcoind does by default.

Kind-of pulling this out of my arse here so don't treat this as gospel but I think what happened was that the big strength of CEX/GHash was that they were very efficient at *financing* buying mining gear and getting it online quickly, so they grew insanely fast during the bitcoin price run-up. There may also have been some irrational exuberance on the part of people buying their mining shares, resulting in more investment than would have been sensible. Then the exchange rate dropped back and they were left with a not-particularly-efficient ASIC operating business.
@_date: 2015-08-05 09:54:39
No, the BIP 66 incident was miners with broken or incomplete software not validating at all (or rather, having an incredibly inefficient validation process consisting of some unlucky engineer getting out of bed and sorting things out manually...) 
Done properly, you only mine on the header during the time it takes invalidate a block, or up to a timeout if the block can't be validated in a reasonable time-frame. If the block turns out to be invalid, you stop mining on it. This gives you all the advantages of avoiding getting blocks orphaned during the time it takes to verify, but avoids losing lots of block rewards in the occasional case where a block turns out to be invalid. 
Since invalid blocks are rare and validation takes longer than zero seconds at any non-zero block size, this is always more profitable than the default bitcoind behaviour of continuing to try to mine a block that will almost certainly be orphaned, so we should probably assume that miners are going to do this.
Luckily done this way you don't end up with 6-block-long reorgs. Even in an extreme case where validation takes 1 minute, you only have a 1/10 chance of mining an additional block on top of an invalid one, so invalid blocks will disappear very quickly. What's more, since it decreases the orphan rate, it increases the cost of a 51% attack. See Tier Nolan's post here:
If you're interested it's also worth reading Tier Nolan's other posts on this from around the same time.

I suspect this is related to point, and people lumbered with pre-internet cabling to the last mile are seeing basically no improvement, to the point where even your mobile signal is better.

Cloud hashing is sort-of a financial service, especially when you can trade hashing shares. Sometimes it's purely a financial service, in that there's no actual hashing going on, just paying old investors with the money from new ones.

The unfortunate thing about deployment by hard fork missile crisis is that the change has to be very simple, to avoid FUD. There are some better ideas put there, like suggestions about targeting UTXO and varying block difficulty and Jeff Garzik's miner voting. 
The best outcome here is if Core get behind a plausible proposal and actually roll it out (supporters aren't going to buy anything that looks like infinite delay at this point), which would kill XT stone dead whether Gavin and Mike agreed to it or not. Failing that, maybe these ideas can be soft-forked in later.

The invalid blocks ultimately got invalidated, albeit by the stupid method of somebody getting out of bed and fixing their shit, rather than the sensible method they could have been using of automatically stopping mining on blocks if you can't validate them by a timeout. And once they fix their systems to do the most profitable thing there, that problem is solved, at least until you change the incentives again by increasing fees...

Bitpay can't use payment channels because they don't exist yet. Once they do exist, they also won't be able to use them if the ecosystem doesn't develop as hoped, or the user experience isn't good enough, or the hubs have too much regulatory exposure, or any of the other things between a clever technical idea and an actual, consumer-deployable system.
The reason none of the alternatives to bitcoin have got traction is because they offer nothing useful that bitcoin doesn't. But you're advocating deliberately turning away users, to send them to something that doesn't exist yet. At that point someone who doesn't turn away customers will get their business, and they'll get the network effect. It isn't complicated.
Now, it's possible that bitcoin will still be useful as a store of value even after the practical transactional use has gone elsewhere, but that doesn't seem like a sensible thing to gamble on.

The mempool fills up when you get a lot of traffic or by chance you get a while without blocks. This makes transactions needlessly slow and cheap for attackers to disrupt.
Also there are a bunch of people busting their arses trying to get more people to use bitcoin. When something goes well you get a large of influx of use in a short time. It's better if we get ahead of this and bitcoin can immediately offer them a reliable, low-cost service rather than scheduling a fork at that point and telling them to go away and come back in months or years.

Sure there is. They're people who think that smaller blocks are better for bitcoin. has been making this case tirelessly since forever, and is of a similar persuasion. On the other side there are big-blockists who think bigger blocks are better for bitcoin. Of course everybody is working on incomplete information here so people may change their minds on this, but right now that's where we are.
Side-chains as normally proposed would be merge-mined by the same people who mine bitcoin, so transactions on a side-chain end up having similar theoretical effects on miner centralization as transactions on the main chain. Since they'd use the same miners and we ultimately want one money (or you'd be advocating alt-coins not side-chains) these decisions are inevitably going to involve a global consensus one way or the other.

Nah, people used to use pools even when block sizes were fairly teensy, not least because they wanted to reduce variance. If you look at the history of this there's no way you can seriously conclude that it's about network latency.
Even if you think the cost of running a node is important, a lot of that will be the cost of keeping an eye on the box and making sure you get it back up quick if it falls over, because downtime is very expensive. If you compare the cost of 24-7 server admin time to the cost of putting a node somewhere with enough bandwidth to send blocks out fast, the second is very cheap compared to the first.
If latency was as big a deal as you seem to think mining would never have migrated to China in the first place, and some of the miners who are in China would have invested in much better setups than they actually have.

Why not leave the mining gear where it is and just put your full node near the backbone?
@_date: 2015-08-27 04:05:49
Yup. Miners receiving blocks are motivated not to accept blocks that are too big, and at some point technically unable to accept them, so they'll get orphaned. Miners producing blocks are motivated not to make them so big that other miners won't receive them, and even if they ultimately do they want it to happen quickly (except possibly in weird cases with network partitions), and bigger blocks are slower to propagate.
However, it's nice for ordinary users to be able to run nodes, and there's no guarantee the equilibrium the miners would find would allow that. And there are some levels that are obviously ridiculous, so you may as well ban them just in case, as Satoshi did back when 1MB used to be ridiculously large.

Tor doesn't help here, the weak point is mining which is most efficiently done using mass-produced parts, at scale, where you can buy cheap electricity. And you only need to hit 51%, which is a far lower bar than crushing an entire technology.
Also they can just ban possession of bitcoins; without exchanges, and with the risk of going to prison just for having them, bitcoin would still exist but it wouldn't be very useful.
The real defence here is to scale up so that every business that owns a congressman uses bitcoin and has a stake in it remaining unmolested.

What's weird about this is transferring all these core bitcoin issues onto the block size. Bitcoin mining provides the perfect conditions for cartel formation. There are incentives to lock out a minority of miners, and there's a perfect way to do it, which is to only share blocks among 51%. You can do this with a big block, but you could equally well do it without a big block.
Likewise selfish mining: Given sufficient share you could gain an advantage by propagating your block slowly, and you could do that by making the block big and hiding the transactions in it until you broadcast it, but you could just as well do it by... just propagating your block slowly. In fact the latter is better, because you can keep more control of when you propagate it.

Sure, they don't want that, but that doesn't mean it isn't what would happen if they got what they want.
What's happening here is that a few (very talented) engineers and cryptographers are trying to redesign the way bitcoin is used based on assumptions about areas that they're wildly unqualified for. The way Satoshi's system succeeded has made it look easy, but he had a rare gift for making the right trade-offs, making things simple in the right places, and understanding how a system can be useful in the actual, existing regulatory landscape. These guys don't seem to get that stuff at all - because they only see the engineering angle, they think bitcoin is wildly inefficient for payments and can't understand how a distributed system like this could be cheaper than the competition. If it was purely an engineering problem, they'd be right. But as Satoshi understood, it isn't.
This would all be fine if all they were doing was engineering and cryptography, but through no fault of their own the core committers have ended up in the position of effectively being the de-facto governing body for the bitcoin protocol, and they're out of their depth. If it isn't fixed, this will end up costing bitcoin holders a lot of money.

You've come up with exactly zero scenarios where small blocks are better. 
Short-term everyone mines on headers and the block reward completely dwarfs fees so there's no centralization effect.
Long-term you already have the transactions unless the miner wants to withhold part of their block on purpose, and if the miner wants to withhold part of their block on purpose they can do so regardless of block size.

@_date: 2015-08-18 03:38:04
Mining unvalidated for longer still isn't a big deal as long as it's a reasonably small proportion of the block interval, so invalid blocks quickly get eliminated and never get very deep in the chain. Short-term (next few years) it actually alleviates most of the problems people are worrying about where slow propagtion is thought to incentivize centralization, whereas using small blocks to jack up fees makes them worse. It also reduces the network's total orphan rate, which increases the cost of a 51% attack, so it's good for network security.
The problem with the fork was that as says, these pools weren't validating at all. Or rather, they had a properly functioning bitcoind that knew the blocks were invalid, but the code to act on this information didn't work (or didn't exist). Apparently their own bitcoind was actually rejecting their own blocks... Obviously this is sub-optimal, and they have a financial incentive to fix it.
@_date: 2015-08-02 13:31:21


What we've been doing to date is gradually scaling up. We have a very good idea what this looks like.
Look at mining. Bitcoin to date has always worked with a big block reward and low fees. We don't know what miners' incentives look like with high fees; For example, a lot of people are worrying about the idea that longer validation times cause mining to centralize, because pools that didn't mine the last block and have to download ithave a disadvantage over pools that did. But if you work through this, it turns out that as far as the block reward goes you can neutralize any effect by doing SPV mining. But what you lose by mining in this way is fee revenue, so higher fees cause mining to centralize.
Now look at users and vendors. Nobody has the faintest idea whether the off-chain systems that are supposed to be decentralized will really be adopted, and if they are whether it will be in a decentralized way, or with just a couple of easily-regulated hubs. We also don't know whether pricing people off-chain will just drive them off to some other coin. There are a bunch of theories about all this stuff, but nobody really knows. In the case of the adoption ecosystem and regulatory exposure of Lightning Network, there's hardly even any theory; Everybody's just talking about the tech.
It may turn out that transitioning to the small-block model is the right thing to do. But what it definitely isn't is the *risk-averse* thing to do.
@_date: 2015-08-04 10:47:50
I think I agree with that. IBLT or similar and SPV mining done properly undermine a lot of the claims made about the block size on both sides.
Small-blockistas often say that big blocks would increase the orphan cost and thus increase mining centralization, but that's not true because you can already have seen the transactions you put in a block, and if you hadn't you could work around it with SPV mining.
Big-blockistas often say (as the OP does) that miners working competitively without coordination have a natural incentive to cap the block size so we don't need to worry that it will become troublesome to nodes. But this is wrong for the same reasons: There's no disadvantage to sending someone a block containing a transaction that they've already got, and if they didn't have the transaction the receiver could mine on headers until they got it, so they don't need to orphan your block.
@_date: 2015-07-11 03:39:46
SPV wallets (ie basically everyone) will follow the longest chain, and a minority fork would always be at risk of attack by people on the majority fork, which puts a &lt;25% minority fork at huge disadvantage. It's possible that some people will try to run this fork - for example, the MPEX guys have this whole economic theory of transaction scarcity that makes bigger blocks sound to them like increasing the block reward sounds to us - but it's a tiny minority. 
It's inconceivable that if 75% are strongly enough in favour to proactively upgrade, everybody else is so strongly opposed that they'd pick the side that didn't have the longest chain, and there are zero pragmatic people in the middle. If there was that much opposition out there, you'd never get the 75%.

had done some analysis that suggested network growth around that rate, but we dug up some more data that suggests it's quite a bit faster, so maybe Pieter wil update his proposal.
That said, the killer here that you have to wait for a "consensus" of everybody else, and read in conjunction with Pieter's earlier statement on the mailing list about what "consensus" means to him - no good if there is still "controversy" even outside the core dev group - it's pretty hard to imagine there ever being one. However, we don't get to find that out for sure until 2017... 
Regardless of the numbers the killer is the proposed process, which seems to be designed never to reach a conclusion. I think the only rational response to this for people who want to use electronic cash rather than a settlement layer is to either try to go around these guys with a fork or just switch to another coin.
@_date: 2015-08-16 22:41:33


Since invalid blocks are rare this is going to be more profitable at any block size substantially greater than zero. If bitcoin can't survive people doing this then it doesn't work. 
Luckily the rational strategy (mine on headers but validate in parallel, and stop mining if the block is invalid or validation times out) suppresses invalid blocks reasonably quicky. Tier Nolan argues that it's better, because the lower orphan rate reduces the cost of 51% attacking it.

* Losing a bunch of mining rewards trying to do an optimization and bollocksing it up, because although they had a correctly validating bitcoind sitting there correctly telling them the block they were mining on top of was invalid, they had no automated method to stop mining on it, resulting in a situation where their own bitcoind was rejecting their own blocks, and creating a huge clusterfuck that some unlucky engineer presumably had to get out of bed and resolve manually.

I think the VPN still does the trick if there's any free country on the internet; What a miner's node does is very clearly visible, and bitcoin is designed to work with a certain proportion of rogue miners, so even if you're right that it's easier to interfere with a node if it's in a datacenter, I don't think that's relevant to the attack you're describing.
Where the VPN doesn't work you is if every jurisdiction on the internet has restricted miners' nodes, but that seems like an incredibly difficult thing for the governments of the world to pull off when there are vastly easier ways to interfere with mining, not least targeting people who can buy and run ASICs cheaply. Right now due to the economics of running mining gear resulting in most of it being in one of a few places, a (Chinese) government attack on bitcoin basically consists of three phone calls, and a bunch of guys running behind Tor can't do anything about that, because they don't have the hardware.
I'm also having a really hard time imagining the world where you can't use a VPN freely for your mining node in any country in the world, but you can still send encrypted traffic via Tor. If the internet is that regulated, backdoor-less encrypted traffic is going to be the first thing to go.

P2SH was 55% and no grace period, BIP 66 was 95% and no grace period. These were both soft forks where a surviving minority can cause a lot of trouble - hard forks are safer in this respect, because the unupgraded minority ignores the longest chain so the rest of the network ignores the unupgraded minority.
Very high thresholds are problematic for controversial issues like the block size because a stubborn minority would risk having their blocks orphaned by the majority. In theory this could happen with BIP 101 at some point between 51% and 75%, but the way opinion tends to be distributed it's likely that in a world where only 51% have said yes, less that 51% will go as far as "Hell yes, orphan anyone who disagrees." Whereas by the time you get near 95%, it's quite plausible you'll have over 51% extremists.

If you're going to artificially fix something to maximize producer revenue, I don't see why you have to use a production quota. If the aim is to create higher prices, why not just go right ahead and fix the prices? That's much more efficient - you can have more imaginative strategies to capture the consumer surplus, and you avoid leaving money on the ground by turning away business once the quota is full.
Bitcoin mining is pretty much the perfect design for forming and enforcing a cartel, so the default assumption should be that this is what miners will do, regardless of what we do with the block size.

Is it practical to circulate fraud proofs so that SPV miners can find out if a block is invalid? If you can do that then you could have miners doing normal mining on a single shard and SPV mining on all the other shards. The validity of transactions in any given block is secured by the ability of the network to invalidate the block via the fraud proof, and the ordering of the blocks is secure against attackers rewriting history because the whole network is working on it.

It would certainly better if mining pools were small and politically separated, but the fact that they're not isn't down to latency issues or the cost of running full nodes. People host in China because it's a good place to buy electricity and mining hardware, and they use larger pools because people like lower variance and better-known brands, or because they're run by the operators of the hardware, who have economies of scale from buying and running their ASICs in bulk.
The decline in the number of relaying nodes may well be related to the cost of running one, and particularly the availability of bandwidth (although this is minor compared to the obvious vast improvements in other wallets, which means you no longer need to run a full node to use bitcoin) but that isn't an existential security risk in the same way that mining centralization is.

The weird thing is everybody's arguing about the block size, when what we should be restricting is balance of UTXOs.
Ways to do it (largely following suggestions by 1) Fixed protocol-enforced limits on the net number of utxos that can be created per block.
2) The same but voted on by miners, along the lines of Jeff Garzik's block size proposal.
3) Use net UTXOs to vary the difficulty target for the block, so if you have good economic reasons for including a lot of them in a block you pay for it in greater cost to create the block, and if you clean a bunch of them up it gets cheaper.
PS We need to roll this out quick, because once people read this post they're going to start creating UTXOs to hoard in case it get implemented...

    Registrant Email: brokerage
    Admin Email: brokerage
    Tech Email: brokerage
However, normally when you transfer a domain you don't just switch the contact info over to the buyer yourself; The domain is managed for you by some registrar, and that registrar has it attached to an account in their systems. I guess if I'm selling to you and I change that information to your email, that would give you the ability to initiate and complete a domain transfer to your registrar, after which you'd have actual control of the domain? But it feels like this may be open to timing shenanigans.
Alternatively if what we're really trying to find out is what account at what registrar is now controlling the domain, is there a way to tell that from the whois? For example there's a field:
    Registry Domain ID: 862917_DOMAIN_COM-VRSN

No, SPV mining is rational even at low orphan rates. Mining is a competitive business with low margins where competition naturally drives the average participant down to barely-attractive profits, so even a 1% difference in orphan rate (eg SPV mine or not to avoid 6 seconds of validation) can make quite a substantial difference to profitability.
Where miners screw themselves (and the network) is if they don't validate at all, but it's perfectly possible to validate in parallel with a timeout, and arguably this is better for the network than just continuing to mine a block that will almost definitely get orphaned.

I just re-read the Lightening paper, and it contains no economic parameters at all. That's to be expected - it's describing the technical mechanics of the proposed system, not what it would take to get it adopted, and whether it would likely be centralized or decentralized in practice, whether customers would adopt one hub or many, whether it would be cheap or expensive to fall back on-chain, whether consumers would require a high level of trust from hubs, whether the resulting ecosystem would be censorship-resistent or censorship-friendly. These are the kind of questions you need to answer to know how far current bitcoin usage could be moved to systems like this without losing the properties that we like about bitcoin.
What's revealing is that you thought this was an answer to my question. The more I read this discussion the more I think the disagreement comes from the fact that you and some of the core devs are looking at this purely as a technical problem, while other people are thinking about the adoption ecosystem and the participants' regulatory exposure. I had the same impression reading Greg Maxwell saying that bitcoin couldn't compete as a payment system because it's so inefficient compared to a centralized database, which in a more sensibly-regulated world would be true, but in the world we actually live in isn't, because the inefficiency in real-world payment systems is not primarily an engineering problem.

Yup, that would be the obvious thing to do. Tier Nolan fleshes that out a bit here:
You don't quite eliminate the risk of building on an invalid block because you may find one before you finish validating, but apparently their current behaviour only saves them 4% in orphans, so even if everyone does this forks built on top of invalid blocks shouldn't last very long.

Cheers. Banks creating money is sort-of true, but this is a bit mad. 
They look at what happens when a particular loan is made and find that the money for it isn't deducted from anywhere at that point, and conclude that it's made up. But that doesn't follow - this stuff only has to work in the aggregate. 
You could make the same argument for any service industry; Say people are working in a hotel, when they deliver the actual service by helping a customer, the help they provide isn't specifically logged against the money the customer paid the hotel. But that doesn't mean the hotel service isn't paid for by the customers; As with the bank, if the customers weren't paying, it would show up in the accounts at the end of the month.

As you say they'd be mining on headers for longer but invalid blocks would disappear almost immediately provided the validation period (and timeout, if you want to protect against bugs and malice) was a reasonably small proportion of the block interval. This is a much more realistic goal than expecting it to be as near as dammit to zero, and bitcoin is specifically designed the way it is because that's an implausible thing to expect.


It's true that the issue re-emerges once the block reward disappears and fees become a serious factor, but we'll have IBLTs or whatever by then so by the time you get the block you'll already have checked its transactions.

I don't know how you can say that - it depends on how much usage there is, how much value people put on it and how much of an increase there is, none of which are known.
Bear in mind that the idea behind deliberately limiting capacity is that it's going to create a fee market which will be better at funding mining than abundant capacity, so for example if the limited-capacity world has 1% of the number of transactions as the abundant world, you need at least 100x the fee just to break even, then you need to jack it up even further to get the extra mining revenue that this system is supposed to provide.
The problem with this is that the high fees then break the assumption that you wouldn't need to trust the hubs because you always ultimately have a transaction that you can use on the blockchain, since there's no value to being able to use a transaction on the blockchain if the fees cost more than the transaction is worth. In turn this breaks the assumption that the network is going to be open and decentralized, because you're going to need trust and reputation to be in the hub business, and that's going to reduce the number of players and paint a target on their backs for regulation.

Well sure, but when Satoshi asked people to try bitcoin he wasn't suggesting that it was OK to throttle some other, proven system because bitcoin would inevitably triumph.
If you look at the current objections to scaling bitcoin, people get very deeply into whether there might be some perverse incentive to miners that might make the system a little bit less centralized. If you're proposing to avoid this hypothetical centralization on the grounds that we can instead use some other system, you need to work through whether that other system is or isn't going to end up being more centralized than the problem you're asking us to avoid.
This isn't meant as a criticism of the white paper, or of people developing Lightening - it's perfectly sensible to build it and see how it turns out. And there's no need for people building technology like this to get involved in speculation about adoption ecosystems and consumer monopolies and regulation - there's nothing wrong with engineers concentrating on engineering and letting other people get on with the other stuff, then waiting and seeing what happens when the system meets the real world.
The problem is that some of the engineers working on these systems are now also making all kinds of assumptions about what will happen when they do meet the real world, and these are mostly assumptions about non-engineering problems. Satoshi made it look easy - he had a rare gift for working out how technology fitted in with the real world and the regulatory environment, and for what needed to be simple and what could be complex. That has been proven in action. I'm not convinced the people now trying to redesign the way we use bitcoin have the same gift, and I'd at least like to see some evidence that their systems work the way we hope before we give up on Satoshi's plan to just scale bitcoin up.

Right, the main non-bonkers argument for restricting block size was that if the time taken to transfer and verify a block was significantly greater than zero, it would put small or badly-connected miners at a disadvantage. ("Badly-connected" here could conceivably mean "on the free-world side of the Great Firewall of China".)
In practice that ship's long since sailed and they're doing SPV mining already. So the obvious solution is to make the code for doing what miners are actually doing more intelligent: Only mine on the unverified header until you've checked the block and then throw it away if it's invalid or times out. Then you can optimize the block size make sure you still have an acceptably small orphan rate in the event people end up building on an invalid block for a while before they realize it's invalid.

There's very little benefit to them for doing this - they'd get the same benefit to the network using a small pool, with the added benefit that someone else is keeping an eye on things if the network forks or whatever.

I suspect you get this as well, which is why you're now trying to slip in "and other expenses"...

Money is pure network effect, and coins that are just bitcoin without the network effect can't compete in markets where bitcoin is competing. But the fee market is specifically intended to price low-value use-cases off the chain. Bitcoin would intentionally stop competing for those markets. If you push someone off the chain, and their use-case works better on a chain, they'll use a different chain. This much is obvious and inevitable.
What's then unclear is whether having gained a network effect with the use-cases that bitcoin gave up on, the low-cost alternative will then be able to move up to use-cases that bitcoin does want. I don't think anyone really knows, but the problem is that if this does happen it'll be too late for bitcoin to respond. This is how slow-moving, conservative incumbents with a lot of advantages get disrupted by nimbler, hungrier competitors, and it happens all the time.

It was what, two pools? Were there even three? They may well have been running the same code, or it may just have been both being in the same situation: Bitcoind doesn't handle mining on headers up to a validation timeout, and the "up to a timeout" bit is more complicated to code. The situation the code needed to address - invalid blocks - hadn't happened recently, because there's a strong incentive not to produce invalid blocks in the first place. BTW people had previously speculated that miners would try to so something like this and bollocks it up and advocated making a proper implementation to do what they were trying to do, so it isn't a complete mystery that this happened.
@_date: 2015-07-30 06:37:05
People have been making all kinds of arguments, and full node count is one of them. 
I think it's actually the best one, in that the premise (bigger blocks make it harder to run a full node) is true, although as says it may be that extra adoption more than makes up for it, and there's a legitimate argument about how much it matters even if it's right.
The mining centralization argument would be persuasive if true, since as you say mining centralization is a very serious threat. But the connection of big blocks to big pools is quite tendentious. 
A move I've seen a lot in this discussion is to try to combine both arguments as part of a vague "decentralization" where people use the node argument (convincing but not important) to persuade people that there's an effect, then switch to the mining argument (important but not convincing) to persuade people that it's a serious security problem.
@_date: 2015-07-17 09:58:40
This goes back to how far you can scale up, at which point we may be talking in circles, but the obvious way to get lots of fee revenue to sustain a high hashrate is to do a lot of volume.
Putting the thing the other way around, bitcoin has a seriously high fixed cost required to run securely, and that can't plausibly be funded by tiny transaction volumes. It would help to do simulations with actual numbers here, but note that even the decentralized off-chain systems people are suggesting only work as intended if you can settle on the blockchain at a reasonable cost if your hub fails, so in the small-block world there's a limit to how far you can hike the fees to make up for the lack of volume without pricing yourself out of the market.

They must have a full node because under normal circumstances they have transactions in their blocks, except for blocks that they find right after the previous one.
It sounds like they just hadn't considered the possibility that a block would be invalid, or else the code that was supposed to check for it failed, so from their mining software's point of view their bitcoind just hadn't caught up yet, and it just kept mining empty blocks on top of empty blocks.

That's not necessarily true, at least on the normal fractional-reserve definition of "sound". If you've been entrusted with some money and lent it out to good businesses or home buyers who will ultimately be able to repay it as planned, but borrowers get scared and try to withdraw their money, an otherwise sound bank could normally borrow the money from their lender-of-last resort. That lender, in this case the ECB, would ultimately be able to get their money back when the business loans and mortgages were repaid.
However, the problem here, as I say upthread, is that as well as homeowners and businesses the banks have lent money to the government of Greece [1], and if the government of Greece can't repay that money then the banks are no longer sound - ie they'd never have enough money to pay back the ECB, even if their business loans and home loans were repaid. In that situation it wouldn't really be responsible for the ECB to keep lending money to these obviously-doomed banks.

This turns out to be a bug not a feature.
The problem with soft forks is that miners that don't upgrade are still obliviously building on the main chain, so even after the initial fork, they still keep producing little zombie branches that will inevitably get orphaned, but temporarily create the longest chain which looks legit to SPV wallets. Hard forks are safer in this respect because once the initial split has happened, unupgraded miners are left mining their own little branch that everyone except unupgraded full nodes will ignore because it never catches up with the main one.
As well as being safer for SPV clients, a hard fork would have been safer for miners that were failing to validate, because they'd also be following the longest chain and ignoring the unupgraded orphan branch. (Hopefully this will be moot next time, because miners have a strong incentive to fix their software - it may be in their interests to work on an unvalidated empty block for the few seconds it takes to validate it, but it's certainly not in their best interests to keep building on invalid blocks after they've discovered they're invalid.)
And as for being hotly debated - isn't that better? The consensus process only works if people know about the change as they apparently didn't here, so absent a regular, scheduled flag day, we should follow responsible, best-practice procedure of bitter factional drama...

No, a hard fork is much better. Soft forks are a nasty hack that leaves unupgraded miners that mistakenly think they're validating blocks properly still adding them to the main chain. This doesn't happen with a hard fork, because after the initial fork miners that didn't get the memo are left harmlessly mining a shorter branch which SPV clients will ignore.

Three ways to mine:
* 1) Validate then start mining.
* 2) Start mining then invalidate (on invalidity or after a timeout)
* 3) Don't validate
2 is the most profitable in all situations.
If there are no invalid blocks, 3 is more profitable than 1 if the validation time is greater than zero, and the difference grows with the validation time. If there are more invalid blocks there's a cut-off somewhere, but it's quite hard to tell where, because relevant factors include how long it takes you to get out of bed to deal with the resulting clusterfvck.
Since invalid blocks are rare and a validation time of near zero isn't a realistic goal, the obvious way forward is to prod and/or help these guys to switch to 2.
Edit: Rereading this I realize there is actually no option 3. All miners currently ultimately stop mining on invalid blocks and orphan them. The question is whether this is done by a human or an automated process. The latter is more efficient, more profitable and avoids dragging someone out of bed at 3am.

These two are another way of saying the cap should never be lifted.
You can't have total confidence that anything in bitcoin is safe. It's an experimental system doing all kinds of things that have never been done before. If you're waiting for total confidence that x is safe you'll never do x. A more sensible consideration is whether doing x is probably safer than not doing x, which is certainly true of a block size increase, since the story where not doing x works out well in the short term involves all kinds of untested assumptions about fee markets and the adoption patterns of alternative systems that haven't been built yet, but all paths have risks.
And you'll never have near 100% consent of the network. This community had a huge soft-fork-voting psycho-drama over the exact syntax for P2SH, FFS.

Hard forks are much safer in this respect than soft forks, because unupgraded miners just think the main chain is invalid and keep mining on the old one. This is a much better situation than what you have with soft forks, which are a nasty hack where nodes that obliviously think they're still validating correctly keep adding doomed little zombie branches to the main chain, and SPV wallets have no way to know they're not real.

The more I look at this debate the more I think it's a discussion between people who only understand the engineering problem and people who understand the regulatory context and the competitive landscape. Viewed purely as an engineering problem, as you and some of the core devs do, you're right: Bitcoin is an insanely inefficient way to process transactions.
But the world's problems with payments are not engineering problems, and compared to the real-word alternatives it's cheap - or at least, it could be cheap if we scaled it up.
Edit to add: Satoshi understood the real-world problems bitcoin solves, and discusses them in the introduction the white paper.

The problem with solutions using actual block or transaction data is that they can be gamed by participants, especially miners. If you think the miners will make good decisions you're probably better just letting them vote like BIP 100, and if you think they can't be trusted you'll probably prefer fixed limits (like BIP 101, but maybe with different parameters) or periodic developer-led forks (which seems to be what we fall back on by default).
@_date: 2019-02-23 07:20:01
Right, so the 3.7 MB number will be for the theoretical gain if transactions were deliberately crafted to make the biggest block you possibly could, ie if not only were all the transactions SegWit, but those transactions were designed to use lots and lots of witness data (which the post-SegWit counting allows lots of) and hardly any non-witness data (which the post-SegWit counting doesn't affect). In practice you'd only actually make blocks this big if you were attacking the network or trying to prove a point.
Currently blocks are nearly full, but most transactions are still not using SegWit. If more transactions start using SegWit, you'll end up with a bigger witness section, which is counted less towards the definition of "full", and allows for more transactions. If *everybody* used SegWit, I think you can squeeze out another 40% or so, but maybe somebody has the exact numbers.

As things stand (no IBLT etc) higher fees risk incentivising miner centralization, because they increase the amount of income you lose relative to competitors when mining empty blocks on headers waiting to download and validate their transactions, which puts smaller and/or badly-connected miners at a competitive disadvantage.
I'm not sure if these miner centralization considerations are really big enough effects to be worth serious concern right now, but if they are then it's important to keep fees low for a while.

This would be correct if there was no grace period, but they have two weeks to switch if Bitcoin-XT gets 75%, so there's no need to go to XT before that to stay in line with the consensus.

It's not a newly discovered problem or anything - this commit is from a while back. If you've got to do a hard fork anyway it makes sense to use that as a chance to deal with longstanding issues like this.
The obvious alternative would be to freeze the transaction size at the status quo and just not grow it as you grow the block size (so the potential for mischief remains and grows, but only linearly) but even with Lighthouse etc 100KB sounds big enough for reasonable purposes.

The discussion of miners' validation incentives isn't right. Rational miners mine on an empty block without validating, but *only until they've had the chance to validate it*. They have an incentive to validate because if the network ultimately decides their block is invalid it'll be orphaned and they'll lose money, as they did in the BIP66 fork. Mining on headers for a small proportion of the interval isn't a problem - it actually makes the network slightly more secure against 51% attacks than letting more of your blocks get orphaned.
The problem with the BIP66 fork was that because their systems were buggy or incomplete, some miners weren't correctly invalidating blocks even after they'd had time to find them invalid. This behaviour cost them money, and they're properly incentivized to fix it.
So it's OK for validation to take a small but not insignificant proportion of the block interval, which was Satoshi's assumption, rather than needing to be effectively zero, which is the logic behind what Eric is saying. This is a good thing, because zero seconds to download and validate a block isn't a realistic goal.

For any given level of legitimate traffic there's a bigger effect than that - you need to compare the additional capacity to the *spare* capacity not the total capacity.

Right, that's the kind of thing I'm thinking of. So all you're potentially missing is transactions that showed up on the network right before the block was made, and even if the miner with the block was the first to see them, they'll have a head start on the block getting from them to you.
So if I'm right you end up with a diff containing little or nothing, except for occasional network weirdness.

In theory since the hubs can't steal your money, it'll be practical to use hubs acting anonymously, which would make them pretty much unregulatable and you wouldn't have to follow any customer-unfriendly rules, because if the hub tried to make you do this you'd just take your business elsewhere.
The problem is that it may turn out that regulations and/or government pressure prevent the vendor you want to pay from peering with these anonymous unregulated hubs, in which case you may end up having to do AML/KYC with a hub before you can transact in the legal economy.
In theory this would still leave you with an open system for the black economy, but a system that's only used illegally is politically much easier to attack at other weak points, for example just pass a law saying anyone who uses it goes to jail.

My take on this is that they mainly interested in stopping big communications providers from turning on end-to-end encryption by default. So they'll make a law that says the Home Secretary can issue an order to a specific company banning them from using end-to-end encryption for a specific service. They won't make these orders targeting financial services companies, and they won't stop geeks from sending GPG-encrypted messages to each other, but they will prevent the non-technical riff-raff from communicating securely unless they work really hard at it.
I don't like this but it's all technically feasible and not particularly damaging to commerce, and probably does actually provide useful information about terrorism, since terrorists tend not to be the sharpest knives in the drawer. (Not to mention information about all kinds of other non-terrorist activity, which is what they're really after.) But they can't put it like this because it doesn't fit with the official terrorism narrative, which involves menacingly cunning, well-organised plots by criminal masterminds, rather than a bunch of dimwits discussing their plans on Facebook then setting themselves on fire trying to blow something up.

Sure, it's possible, but it remains to be seen whether when implented in the real-world this would be an open and decentralized system, or a closed and/or centralized system.

We've been thinking about adding domain monitoring to Reality Keys so you can do simple bitcoin escrow contracts based on domains.
Can anyone who knows the domain registration process well comment on the practicalities of this? I'm wondering if there are potential holes like:
* 1) Pay money into escrow
* 2) Ask counterparty to transfer domain
* 3) Quickly transfer domain to a sock puppet
* 4) Claim you never got it, which Reality Keys (or whoever is powering the escrow) will confirm so you can get your money back
Obviously even if this was possible you could work around it if the history of the domain can be proved, but I couldn't find anywhere to get an authoritative history of a domain: There are people who seem to be polling them regularly to give you histories, but maybe there's still potentially a gap between polls you could squeeze some mischief into?

This wouldn't be a fractional reserve, this would be trading while insolvent.
The point of fractional reserve is that you've lent most of the money out, but you'll ultimately get it back. Since you only have a fraction in reserve you wouldn't be able to pay the deposits back if everyone asked for them at the same time, but hypothetically if you had a bankruptcy process, you could sell off the loan book and everyone would get their money back.

You don't need anything fixed in the protocol - all you need is the agreement of 50%+ of miners (they can vote on rules in the block chain if they like, or come to an agreement out-of-band if that's easier) who can then enforce whatever rules they like. So there would be no problem for them to agree to minimum fees in USD or whatever, although they'd probably also want to agree on a price feed. 
The only way I can think of to try to profitably undercut the cartel without getting your blocks orphaned for breaking the rules would be to promise to refund the fee out-of-band in exchange for sending the transaction only to you (so you get the fee), but that slows down confirmation in itself, and in any case if there was too much defection the cartel could enforce a fee pool.

I wouldn't like to draw too many conclusions from the way miners chose to fight the fire once they realised their software was wrong: Basically their bitcoinds thought that their own blocks were invalid, but the code to turn this into action and actually stop mining on them was missing or broken.
Anyhow the point I was trying to make is that miners have a strong incentive to mine valid blocks not invalid ones, which the way this incident played out once people got their shit together would support.
The other thing this incident shows is the inherent danger of *soft* forks, which are a nasty hack where the unupgraded miners that mistakenly think they're validating correctly are still adding blocks to the main chain, then wondering why they keep getting orphaned. Hard forks are a lot cleaner, because the unupgraded miners quickly relegate themselves to a shorter chain that everybody else ignores, including SPV wallets.
This is quite a nice, clean way to upgrade (or not upgrade as the case may be, since 75% of mining power for XT is a very heavy lift), and the idea of trying to avoid it by pushing all the complexity and uncertainty down to merchants and wallets sounds quite heroically bonkers.

BTW scaling via side-chains has a lot of the same properties that small-blockistas are worried about with big blocks, and worse. Specifically, miners get fees for mining the sidechains, and they can potentially get more fees by mining more transactions, and in theory may be able to get an advantage over smaller competitors by propagating them slowly.
This is actually quite a lot worse from this point of view than just scaling bitcoin up, because you greatly increase the complexity of running a mining node profitably: You not only need to run bitcoin, you need to run all the various side-chains and keep up to date with them.

Ripple was never decentralized in the first place. 


I hate to be the one to break this to you but large mining farms are already in known locations, mostly in China. Even if they weren't the ASIC manufacturers are known, and it would be easy to prevent them from shipping at a competitive cost to unregistered miners.
The weird thing about this whole discussion is how people are transferring all these basic problems bitcoin has onto the block size. Mining has centralized because buying and running mining equipment has economies of scale. This is a very serious problem, and it may end up killing bitcoin. But the block size has nothing to do with it.

OK, this sounds doable. What fields in the whois would the oracle need to check to confirm practical control of the domain?
@_date: 2015-07-16 11:31:58
Also most miners already mine on headers until they've received and validated a block, up to (if they were rational and their software worked properly) a timeout. There's a slight advantage to keeping them waiting up to the timeout, because they can't get fees on transactions mined in the meantime, and you might get those if you get the next block. In the small-blockista narrative they do this by packing the block with phoney transactions, but there's no need to do this: if they prefer they can just hold on to part of the block until later instead.
The upshot is that high fees encourage miner centralization.
This is where the block size argument gets weird, because the small-blockistas think smaller blocks will result in higher total fees, which if true would mean small blocks result in the opposite of what they say they want, but in the long run they're probably not right about this.

I'd be interested to hear from people working on this kind of use-case but I'd have thought once the payments are no longer based on ownership of a private key all you need is a database with a publicly visible revision history, which you could do with the bitcoin blockchain, but it doesn't sound like the easiest way to do it.

Clearly it's not a good thing having blocks that take 20 minutes to verify, whether they're valid or not. But on proposal presumably the majority only hashes on it for the 20 minutes it takes them to verify it? That's not good, but it seems less bad than doing what they're doing now and just skipping validation altogether, even in the 20 minute case, and much less bad in the normal situation where the time taken to verify is a small fraction of the average block interval.
@_date: 2015-08-06 10:57:45


Yup. It might actually be worth incorporating this information in wallet UIs, if they feel like presenting the user something more sophisticated and user-friendly than "number of confirmations".
Also since invalid blocks are very easy for anyone with a full node to detect, wallets might want to start getting information about invalid blocks out-of-band. In an idea world we'd have cryptographic fraud proofs, but wallets already mostly rely on a couple of semi-trusted parties for exchange rate information and things, so it might be a reasonable trade-off to have services in a similar role that are able to trigger the wallet saying, "Hold on, we're not sure about this, give it a bit more time".

This is only actually true if fees go up. In practice people just mine an empty block on a header until they have a chance to validate the block, so the size of the block makes no difference to the orphan rate. The only thing you lose if you're slow is the fees for transactions you could have mined during the few seconds when you were mining an empty block.
Eventually the block reward goes away and this becomes a consideration, but right now if scarcity produces higher fees (which is apparently the idea, although I'm not convinced) that's what creates the centralization pressure.
@_date: 2015-07-07 00:54:39


If this is right then it means that the time it takes to transfer and validate a block basically needs to be zero or the network will stop validating, which isn't a realistic goal. Luckily it isn't right: Presumably what these miners were trying to do was to only mine on unvalidated blocks *for the few seconds it takes to validate*, which would have been OK if they hadn't bollocksed the implementation up. This would be a good strategy at any block size, so we probably need to accept that they're going to do it and get a properly-written implementation out there to do it for them.
Good stuff by Tier Nolan on how to do this right:

I don't think so, Pieter's process is still an undefined "consensus" that depends on the thing not being "controversial", where "controversy" is undefined but apparently goes beyond the core developers, so basically nothing moves unless world+dog agrees, which they're not going to.
However, the idea is that you don't get to find this out for sure for a year and a half.
@_date: 2015-07-07 01:06:35
In practice you'll have much more than 75% because miners who have heard about the change will upgrade during the grace period. 
But you wouldn't have this problem in any case because it's a hard fork, which despite having "hard" in the name is safer in many respects than a soft fork, which is a bit of a hack. With a hard fork you'd have an initial divergence at the first upgraded block, but after that the unupgraded clients just keep mining away on their little orphan branch, which SPV clients will then ignore. This is better than a soft fork, where they just keep merrily mining away on the main chain producing blocks that look fine to themselves and SPV clients, and wondering why the network keeps orphaning them after a block or two.
Likewise, with miners, if anyone out there is still not verifying at that time they'll go with the upgraded fork, so even if they were advertising that they were with the &lt;25% they'll really be with the &gt;75%.
@_date: 2015-07-11 02:46:36
This is all a bit mad. 
Note that unlike a soft fork, a failure to validate means you accept the change (since you're allowing anything) so it's quite hard to get here by being lazy. 
So then the thought is apparently that somebody's going to do this on purpose. That somebody needs a minimum of 25%, and all they'd accomplish would be a brief fork until some miners realised what was happening and switched back. But in reality nearly all the remaining 25% will have switched over during the grace period rather than be left mining dead coins, so unless you have more like something in the high 40s all you'll accomplish will be orphaning your own blocks. And if you've got something in the high 40s you can create a reasonably long-lived fork any time you like.
@_date: 2015-07-05 01:05:31
They could do that but they'd be idling their fast-depreciating hardware for no reason. You hardly ever find an invalid block, since someone has to waste money to create one in the first place, so it doesn't make sense to leave that money on the floor.
@_date: 2015-07-24 00:10:44
I don't think that's obvious at all. As Tier Nolan points out it (slightly) increases the cost of a 51% attack compared to letting more blocks get orphaned, which is a good thing. And even if it was a bad thing, it's going to be at least somewhat more profitable unless the time to download and validate a block is zero, which isn't a realistic goal, so the effort put into striving to prevent it could probably be better spent elsewhere.

@_date: 2015-07-06 00:14:06
Not particularly - it slightly increases the average time between confirmations, but done correctly it also makes it less likely that blocks will be orphaned, which means that once your transaction does get confirmed, you can be more confident that it will stay that way.

I'm not disputing that there would be a continuity coin - there probably will - it just won't be worth much or used much if it doesn't have majority hashing power, and that in turn further reduces the attractiveness of mining it. The obvious thing to do would be to switch it to a different kind of proof-of-work, like Litecoin did. This avoids the risk of getting attacked by people mining the majority fork.

Dunno, building on a block before you have a chance to validate it may be rational in some circumstances, but continuing to do so even after you could have done the validation sounds seriously sub-optimal, doesn't it? 
It may still be a good business decision for them if they can't spare the dev time to optimise, but it doesn't sound like they've hit on the dominant strategy that everyone will ultimately end up following.
Edit to add: Come to think of it a half-arsed implementation that breaks bitcoin too little to damage the value of your coins but enough to motivate someone to write the code you need to do this sensibly at no charge sounds like an excellent strategy...

On a bit of a tangent, I think Vitalik was talking about the idea that you scale by only validating a subset of transactions by default, but being able to escalate to a larger group of validators if something funny happens. Augur does something like this - their validation is supposed to consist of people independently checking the outcomes of real-world events (*), which is obviously very expensive if you have lots of things to validate and everyone has to do it. But they have this thing where you only vote on a few randomly-selected outcomes, but (IIUC) decisions can get appealed to a wider pool.
(*) In practice I reckon they're probably all going to just pull from a data feed, which is cheap and scalable but harder to sell as decentralized...

I think the ideal outcome here would be for GavinCoin to keep the bitcoin brand and GregCoin to be called something new, since the existing user and wallet ecosystem is based around the properties that GavinCoin would have and GregCoin would lose, and Greg has a lot of ideas (aside from small blocks) that would be easier implemented from a clean slate.

I think there's a kind-of lingering folk memory about this from the days before SPV wallets, when ordinary users needed to run full nodes to buy their drugs and alpaca socks with, and it was assumed to be very difficult to make those people upgrade. Nowadays if you're running a full node it's most likely because you're either a technical enthusiast, running some kind of service with it or have very particular security requirements, and those are the kind of people most likely to be keeping an eye on things.
At this point I think there's a strong argument to be made that we should stop doing soft forks and just do hard ones.

Just reading up on this, the UTXO commitments stuff seems to do the trick, doesn't it?




I'm not saying this is wrong but I'm not really following it. The current situation is that rational miners start off mining an empty block on the headers of each block they receive, and meanwhile they try to download the transactions and validate the block, and if they fail to validate the block they (hopefully) treat it as invalid and throw away it and anything that may have been mined on top of it. Why would the incentives be different if, instead of validating the block themselves and finding that it was bad, somebody else had sent them a fraud proof that showed them it was bad?
Also, why would you need this extra consensus step? Surely the consensus is that once people realize a block is invalid, they stop mining on top of it, just as now?

Actually since miners are initially mining on headers already, you shouldn't need big blocks if you want to keep them mining on headers for longer - you can already send the header then hold on to part of the block for as long as you like, up to whatever timeout the receiving miner is implementing. So this makes no difference in the "miners are going to mine on headers" world.
If you're suggesting we're going to try to stop miners mining on headers in the first place by trying to shrink the incentive down fairly small (with teensy blocks) then it's *you* who's assuming cooperation, since it's always more profitable to mine on headers at any block size - the only question is how much profit they're willing to give up to mine the way you think they should be mining.
@_date: 2015-07-07 02:20:54
If the optimization is not to verify at all then the effect is the same regardless of block size, but the incentive to make it would be greater at higher block sizes.
Lucikly for bitcoin this optimization is by no means the optimal strategy for miners, and was almost certainly done because the miners' software was broken. The sensible strategy here is to only mine on an unvalidated block for the few seconds it takes to validate it, and to stop mining on it if it's invalid or times out. 
If miners are doing this it also addresses the main mining centralization concern with bigger blocks, since the only downside to receiving blocks slowly (which it was thought might put smaller pools at a disadvantage) becomes those few seconds of fees, and that only for blocks found within those few seconds.

What's striking about this for a system that's being presented as a solution that relieves the need to scale bitcoin is that nobody seems to have even *theorized* about the incentives of people to use the system in different ways, or the regulatory exposure of nodes, or the user experience in different configurations, or any of the stuff that controls whether it would actually be used in the real world, or whether it would really be decentralized and/or censorship-free. This thing's being pushed by engineers and cryptographers who seem to be completely oblivious of all of the issues beyond engineering and cryptography.
Which would all be well and good if the conversation was, "We've thought of this cool thing, let's build it and see what it's useful for!", but these people seem to have jumped straight to "It works in my imagination, so this is how bitcoin is going to scale!"

Maybe you could fill out the argument for why you're so worried about hard forks?
In some ways they're a lot cleaner and safer than soft forks, which leave the unupgraded minority that obliviously think they're mining valid blocks still adding them to the longest chain. This results in lots of little doomed zombie branches, and SPV clients can't tell that they're invalid until they inevitably get orphaned.
With a hard fork you get the initial divergence then you're done: Since they think the longest chain is invalid, all the unupgraded miners just mine away harmessly on an orphaned chain that never catches up.

They did it because their systems were broken. It's very, very bad if a large proportion of mining power has broken systems. However:
1) They then got spanked by the consensus process for having broken systems. This is Satoshi's system of incentives working correctly.
2) In the event that some miners don't fix their systems, perhaps because invalid blocks are unusual and it's not worth the development cost, the community could help them by providing some properly reviewed code for mining on empty blocks until a validation timeout. The way stock bitcoind currently works is less profitable if block propagation and validation takes more than zero seconds, which isn't a realistic goal at any block size, and as discussed above the network would actually be better secured if miners did what they're trying to do instead of what stock bitcoind currently does.






That's not the only signal, because their nodes should be printing warnings, but yes, the fact that the network seems to have more-or-less stopped mining blocks should help tip people off that something is wrong.






People running unupgraded full nodes will become very confused, but nowadays running a full node is only something you do if you're either very technically interested or running a service behind it, and these are the people most able to find out about and handle an upgrade. Realistically nobody economically important is going to be on the old fork because they haven't heard about the new one, and nearly everybody needs to do nothing, because they're using SPV. Also the other great thing about this upgrade is that unlike BIP66, it's highly *controversial*, so it's much harder to fail to hear about it.

Where this ends up is the people who can't get their transactions on the main chain make a merge-mined alternative chain (side-chained or otherwise). They'll have enough fees that not only will it be attractive enough to miners to get nearly as much security as bitcoin, you won't be able to compete as a miner without mining the second chain.

I see your point - this one's a bit hard to call. Miners have the ability and incentive for cartel-like behaviour. Do we:
a) Tell them not to, and hope to make it socially unacceptable to go down that road
b) Accept they're going to do it and try to set up some sensible default behaviour that minimizes the harm and keeps the cartel open
There's a parallel here with SPV mining, which is also in miners' interests at any block size. Core won't do this by default, but it's more profitable than what Core does do by default. Done properly (with a validation timeout) this isn't particularly harmful to the network, and may be beneficial. Some people suggested making a good, well-tested implementation in Core, since miners were going to do it anyway. This didn't happen, and the miners went ahead with their own proprietary ways of doing the same thing, and we ended up with a big old fork because they forgot to build in a way to stop their systems building on an invalid block.

That's sort-of what merge-mining is. Basically as well timestamping bitcoin transactions when they find a block, miners also timestamp transactions for the other chain, which can have its own rules. The cost of the proof-of-work is the same as if they were only mining bitcoin, and they get to collect fees from both chains.
Obviously you didn't need trustless timestamping of transactions in the first place this may be overkill, but if that was their situation you'd think would have suggested it to them...

If Fidelity transactions provide enough fee income to justify miners bothering to set up merge-mining, the Fidelity chain will become as secure as bitcoin.
To the extent that FidelityChain's larger blocks made bitcoin less secure by promoting miner centralization, the hypothetical loss of security would also apply to bitcoin, because it would share the same miners.
PS Interesting corollary: When the block reward goes away, bitcoin may not actually need fees to secure its mining. It can parasite off other merge-mined chains...

That would depend how much bigger. Datacenter scale would likely mean fewer relaying nodes, as not many people have datacenters. But BIP 101 isn't a proposal for datacenter scale. It's a compromise that accomodates people who think it's important to be able to run a full node at home, by targeting a good consumer-level PC and internet connection.
To give you an idea just how conservative it is, you could run comfortably a full validating node that would keep up with the network several times over at 8GB blocks on a gigabit line. These are available to consumers here in Japan right now, and people are getting around 0.6 gbps to 0.7 gbps up and and down on these lines as we speak. But BIP 101 doesn't allow blocks this big until 2036!

More to the point, there's something to be said for the things that the Bitcoin Foundation used to do being split among different organisations so it looks less like there's one group of people in charge of everything. So we're getting core development funded through MIT, US lobbying by CoinCenter, etc.
I guess then the Bitcoin Foundation then does PR / media management, since they're the people journalists think are in charge? Maybe if that's all they're doing they won't need as much money and can be reformed to be less dependent on people who raise and bring in a lot of money, as this often seems to require some hustling skills/personalities that can bring along some unhelpful baggage.

Miners can do all this stuff already just by 51% setting their own rules and orphaning any block that breaks them. They can also screw whatever minority of miners they want to, without needing to tinker around with block size voting.
What I like about Jeff's proposal is that it goes with the grain of what people can already do and already have incentives to do. What I don't like is where it departs from that with an excessively large supermajority, which incentivizes the 80% to orphan the blocks of the 20% and invalidate their votes. Some kind of supermajority would probably be OK, but going too far from a bare majority is asking for trouble. More common numbers in successful voting systems are 60% and 2/3.

Reasons for having conferences instead of normal online discussions:
1) Impression of academic rigour, since academia has traditionally used conferences instead of the internet, due to the internet not having been invented yet
2) Ability to make bold, clever-sounding claims later about things people said without your opponent being able to conclusively refute them, because you can't actually look it up - at best you have to wade through a video, and it may not be verifiable at all.

I've run into the same problem doing smart contract stuff: You put the whole thing in a fully client-side app that will run forever and doesn't rely on any central server once it's downloaded, but you end up depending on blockchain.info or blockr.io, and once they fall over the app will break. Sampling some full nodes would be sybil-attackable (although I think Lighthouse has some mitigations) but the protection from losing money that way is already in the smart contract mechanisms, as it has to be since if you take action based on UTXOs they may be gone by the time you've finished whatever you're doing.

The problem with sidechaining alt-chains in the way described in paper is that the properties the sidechain needs to have to work are quite horrible for most alt-chains. Namely:
* Same PoW as bitcoin or something similar that's simple enough for bitcoin nodes to verify its SPV proof. This is nasty because your small chain can be attacked by bitcoin miners. If you haven't got majority hashing power you're better with a different PoW, or PoS.
* Absolute reliance on the longest chain. If you don't have majority hashpower you're at serious risk of a 51% attack. The solution is "weak subjectivity": The users will ignore the attacking chain even if it's the longest. But bitcoin nodes don't know which is the attacking chain. They have to follow the longest. So the defence doesn't work if you're side-chained.
* No ability to print money to pay for mining. (Speaks for itself.)
On top of those problems with your own chain, you also import the risk of bitcoin breaking, plus the risk of something going wrong with the sidechains mechanism (eg bitcoin devs or miners decide it's a bad thing and kill it.)
What you get in return is a potentially more stable currency than your alt-coin, but if you really need stability then bitcoin probably isn't a great fit either.

If the goal is to validate then there's nothing wrong with leeching, but you're contributing bandwidth if you're uploading more than you download.

There are all kinds of unjustified assumptions in there. You may have justifications for them, but you need to explain them to have any chance of persuading anyone.
For instance, fees have never been zero without an effective limit, and with smaller blocks you have less transactions to pay them, so it's not at all obvious that you get less money for network security from the smaller blocks.
The orphan rate depends on bandwidth and technology, but in your previous comment you said that's irrelevant, which makes no sense. Mining centralization depends on the orphan rate and its relationship to other costs. So doesn't seem to make sense to just assume this stuff away and argue from first principles. 
It's not enough to just assert all this stuff, you need to actually justify it.
@_date: 2015-11-13 12:42:31
I don't think anyone disagrees that bitcoin needs to be decentralized with the goal of censorship-resistence. The disagreement is:
* Some people think the block size seriously impacts mining centralization, other people think it's minor or irrelevant and the real drivers are things like economies of scale buying and operating mining hardware.
* Some people think more traffic means fewer nodes, other people think more traffic means more adoption and more nodes.
* Some people think lots of relaying nodes are important, other people think you just need enough to blow the whistle on invalid blocks, which is quite a low bar.
* Some people think censorship is mainly resisted by technical means, like keeping traffic small so that it's easy to hide, whereas other people prefer the internet model where lots of adoption makes the system politically difficult to attack and dissident transactions are protected because they use the same infrastructure as popular or economically important transactions.
* Some people think it matter whether the actual payment infrastructure people interact with is centralized (eg if customers and merchants all use Coinbase the actual transactions are easy to censor in practice), other people think that doesn't matter as long as the underlying layers are still safe.

Nodes or miners? Taking nodes first, new connections here in Tokyo are often gigabit - that's best effort, but you typically get 0.5 gbps up and down in practice. That's comfortably enough to run a validating node with 8GB blocks without leeching, but BIP101 is so conservative that it doesn't schedule blocks that big until *2036*.

Peter R is making an argument about what happens to fees if there's no block size limit, but BIP 101 doesn't abolish the block size. So if you're making an argument about what BIP 101 does and you want to say the effect you're hypothesizing is (5) *"significant"*, it's not enough to do it from first principles; You need to make a simulation with actual numbers about how when block size hits A while bandwidth is B, the orphan rate is C, and therefore given X% mining share you'll find Y% more blocks and make Z% more money from not needing to propagate to yourself.
@_date: 2015-11-30 14:43:07
Here in the developed world (Japan) we can already get home connections fast enough to handle 8GB blocks with plenty to spare. Maybe Japan is ahead of its time but the idea that the rest of the world isn't going to catch up with what we have here now by 2036 is ludicrous.

The protect each other, because restrictions on BigCoin would serve to drive people to the more nefarious SmallCoin while BigCoin users will want to lobby against regulation of SmallCoin that may ultimately affect them too.
The remaining question is which one gets the Bitcoin brand. Arguably BigCoin can make better use of it as it already has some merchant adoption that SmallCoin doesn't want, because SmallCoin is optimised for hodling / settlements and can't accomodate the merchants in any case. OTOH the bitcoin brand is already quite tainted for legal use, so maybe BigCoin is better starting over fresh.
Either way we should stop faffing around and get the schism over and done with so everybody can move on.

We're talking about validating nodes, not mining nodes. Theymos was fretting that only large companies will be running them, when in reality BIP 101 is designed specifically to accommodate people who think it's important for  home users to be able to run nodes.
Miners would presumably want something faster come 2032 than a good home connection from 17 years ago, since the ability to propagate blocks quickly is part of their competitive advantage and as you say a small difference in the time it takes to get your block to the network can make a big difference to your profitability. That said, more efficient block propagation (relay network, IBLTs, Core's efforts to make mempools closely synced etc) will reduce some of this difference. 
@_date: 2015-11-07 11:47:45

Your peers. If your connection is 8x to 10x actual traffic you'll be contributing bandwidth as long as you upload more than you're downloading. I mentioned this in a previous comment but some people have the misconception that because you're connected to a lot of nodes, you need to upload a big multiplier of the amount you download to contribute bandwidth to the network. But this isn't true because your peers are also connected to other peers and able to get data from them.


I know pruning is taking a while and getting rolled out in stages but it should be done by 2032.
@_date: 2015-11-07 13:14:37






I mean it's not relevant to the ability of people on consumer internet connections to run a validating node. So for the sake of argument, if the residential Tokyo gigabit connections we were talking about had gigabit download but really sucky upload, you'd have to download from servers in datacenters but we'd still have lots of independent people validating on normal residential lines.
As it happens they also have enough upload bandwidth that they wouldn't have to leech, but that isn't necessary to perform the security role that theymos is saying he's worried about.
@_date: 2015-09-21 21:36:14
Just to put the current proposals in perpective, BIP 101 maxes out at 8GB in 2035, which could be comfortably accomodated on a gigabit line. Connections like this are available at a resonable price here in Japan right now, so plenty of home users could run nodes even if there was zero bandwidth growth between now and then.
@_date: 2015-11-07 10:01:49
A bit more context on this: The UK government just announced plans to make availability of at least 10 Mbps a legal requirement by 2020, even if you're way out in the boonies. 
 
Obviously it's a politician's promise so YMMV, but at that point the BIP 101 max is at 8 MB * 2 * 2, which would take 22 seconds to download at that speed, so there's really no problem running a validating node.
As far as preserving the ability of lots of people to run validating nodes goes, BIP 101 is just extremely conservative.

It's relevant to getting the data you need to start validating, which is what you were worrying about.

I don't think anyone's saying we shouldn't have upgrades, just that at this point hard forks are cleaner and safer.
This wasn't necessarily always true, since there was a time before SPV wallets when ordinary users with no interest in auditing the network used to run full nodes, and getting them to upgrade would have been difficult in practice. But this is no longer true: If you run a full node it's because you want to audit the network or because you have high security requirements, neither of which are served by obliviously trying to validate thinking the new transactions saying things like "This can only be spent after 2017" are valid now.

Yup, that's the right security assumption: You need enough people running nodes that somebody is ready, willing and able to blow the whistle on an invalid block.
Obviously this precludes infinitely huge blocks. I'm not sure if that's what is advocating - generally people want to just remove the cap don't think miners would make unmanageably huge blocks in the first place. BIP 101 is so conservative that you can buy ordinary consumer lines here in Japan right now that will be fast enough to accommodate the block sizes scheduled for 2036.
PS. As it turned out during the BIP 66 fork you could indeed have just carried on running an upgraded full node and ignored the whole thing, but that wouldn't have been a sensible thing to do if you'd had high security requirements. The Berkeley DB Bug fork went the other way and the consensus orphaned a fairly long chain and went back to the buggy-software fork.

How you approach this depends what problem you're trying to solve.
If the problem is that you can't get bandwidth for your SPV wallet, you can solve it by paying people you download from.
If the problem is that you're worried that a miner will publish an invalid block and nobody will notice, you can pay somebody to keep an eye on things and alert you if there's an invalid block.
The reason why neither of these solutions have been implemented is that neither of these problems actually exist right now. There's loads of bandwidth to spare, and the chances of a miner publishing an invalid block and nobody blowing the whistle on it are zero.

Un-upgraded miners ignore the main chain and mine on their own shorter, irrelevant chain. This is far better than mining lots of little chains that will ultimately get orphaned, but SPV clients have no way to know that that.

The idea that nobody ever should be trusting a third-party is astonishingly mad. I don't know where people are getting it from. You haven't read and understood all the bitcoin code, and all the libraries it uses, and everything on your OS that it depends on. That's not what the "trustless" in bitcoin means.
In bitcoin it's good to give people the option of running everything yourself, and plenty of people do (including me) but there's nothing wrong with making sensible security trade-offs to outsource responsibilities to other people.
@_date: 2015-10-08 01:33:11
That depends on what you're securing, how quickly you need to resolve it and on what kind of invalid the block is. Invalid blocks are quite unusual, so in a lot of cases you'd probably just stop trusting payments until the problem sorts itself out, or people start saying a chain longer than x is trustworthy. This is exactly what you'd have done during the BIP 66 fork, even if you'd had a full node. 
That said one thing you could do here is to effectively run the human-mediated version of an automated fraud proof. For example, if the issue is that there's a transaction in a block with an invalid signature, somebody can show you that transaction and prove it's part of the block. 
It may sound unrigorous to use these social heuristics like "everybody says this is OK even though lots of people have a chance to check and say it isn't", but this is how we know to trust the software in the first place.
@_date: 2015-10-03 13:37:10
Just go ahead and apply a connection limit so your traffic is at a level you're comfortable with.
There are all kind of things that could be done to incentivize full nodes, but nobody does them because as things stand it wouldn't solve a practical problem anybody actually has. There are enough full nodes with enough connections and enough bandwidth to supply the network. If it gets short, people will work out a way to pay for more.
I know some people worried about the network being insufficiently audited, but if that's the problem you're trying to help with by running a full node then you'll still be helping if you drop your connection limit down.
@_date: 2015-11-30 14:52:34
Miners build their own binaries in any case, which they'll do from XT's BIP-101-Only branch or apply the patch themselves.
If it looks like miners are upgrading, someone will make bitcoin binaries with BIP 101 for everybody else. They'll have the choice between XT, which somebody will certainly be maintaining under these circumstances, and BIP 101 Only, which somebody else will be maintaining if only to prevent too many people switching to XT.

TBF if you're accepting unconfirmed transactions in situations where fraud matters you already need to be ready to adapt quickly to people coming up with new ways to double-spend. Handling doublespends is a bit like handling spam: You can do effectively enough for a lot of situations, but you need to be on the ball, and even then you'll occsionally mis-classify something. I don't think it's unreasonable to expect people doing this to change their code to start checking a flag.
@_date: 2015-10-03 21:51:35


That depends what you want the full nodes for.
If the goal is to have lots of people auditing the network then it's a hard problem, because a few people can run lots of nodes (or appear to) and take lots of rewards without really increasing the number of auditors. But if that's the goal, it isn't harmed by the OP running with a low maxconnections or even listen=0.
But if the goal is to make sure you can download blocks reasonably fast and there's enough bandwidth out to support SPV clients, the solution is for people to charge for providing the data. This isn't particularly hard, but currently nobody would bother paying right now because there isn't a problem to solve: You can get blocks fine. Nobody's going to pay to solve a problem that doesn't actually exist.
@_date: 2015-10-15 11:18:33
It's not about node storage requirements for nodes, it's about validation and propagation delay for miners. I don't think this proposal addresses the ease of running a non-mining node one way or the other.
@_date: 2015-10-19 02:13:32
Yup, something like that. 
I think you'd need a trusted third-party like Reality Keys or a federation thereof to do it that particular way, as bitcoin doesn't give scripts direct access to the block hash. (Ethereum does, so you could pay with ether...) But there might be something clever you could do involving orphans or whatever.

They wouldn't be risking a giant schism. They run BIP 101 code and it has exactly no effect until such time as 75% of miners do the same. This probably won't happen because it's a very high hurdle and if it looks like it might be cleared then Core can head it off by agreeing a smaller increase. But if it does happen then the rest of the miners and the overwhelming majority of bitcoin users will upgrade.

This is a nice place to do probabilistic micropayments. Tip an amount and a win probability, say 10 cents and 0.1%. Your website records the fact that you tipped, and communicates it to the tipee in whatever way seems appropriate. If they're lucky, you send them $100. If they're unlucky they can still find out that they were sent the tip, but they don't have to waste their time signing up for something to collect 10 cents.

Theymos is talking about nodes validating for themselves, so relaying to somebody else isn't relevant. 
But in any case except in weird, theoretical attack-by-the-miner scenarios you'd already have most of the transactions in the block by the time it was mined, and you'd relay them as they came in, so there would be nothing uncomfortable about running on a connection that could handle 8x to 10x actual traffic.

Am I right in reading your blog post as saying bitcoin exchanges in Germany have to pay VAT on the bitcoins they sell?

Maybe we don't disagree, but the common thread I'm getting at is what happens after the banknote has passed through multiple owners. If we say that a banknote is only yours if it legitimately belonged to everyone along the chain to you, that will make civil forfeiture much easier to do in practice. Compare worlds with and without the assumption that blacklisted coins could have been received in good faith, and belong to the final owner:
With: Find the first person to receive coins from the criminal/dissident, and demonstrate that they knew they were related to criminal/dissident activity.  
Without: List these coins as seized and wait for them to belong to somebody you can identify, then force them to hand them over. Even if this person never shows up in your jurisdiction, the value of the coins is lower, which is better than nothing for law enforcement.

There might be some jurisdictions out there somewhere where you can get away with selling financial services into the US without the US being able to enforce their legal action against you, but Ireland isn't one of them.

If it is, it would be reassuring if they'd tell us.

Right, so now we've established a way for government to enforce title of bitcoins after they get passed along along through multiple owners, we can start to expand the scope of its control. 
The DEA thinks these coins have been used in drug trafficking? It can legally "seize" them, and make them officially its property. They can't collect from the drug dealer, because they don't have the private keys and they don't know who the drug dealer is, but once they come into the hands of a normal private citizen who they can identify, they can reclaim them from them.
What the DEA can do for drug dealers, so can the Chinese government do for donations to Tibetan activists, etc etc.
We end up with a bunch of blacklists, bitcoins of various different values, and shopkeepers in California enforcing Chinese government crackdowns on dissidents for fear of ending up with less valuable coins...

ZeroHedge has got this whole thing backwards. 
In normal times governments want to put a limit on the amount of money they guarantee, to prevent moral hazard. But when lots of banks are in trouble at the same time, they get scared of bank runs, so they raise the guarantees, either by explicitly changing the rules or by reassuring depositors that they won't let their savings be lost.
What's now happening is that the worst of the crisis seems to have passed, so governments are going back to the normal guarantees. They're also putting in some new rules to make sure banks have a slice of assets that get wiped out first before regular depositors do, to give them a cushion before they need another government bail-out.
The inter-government version of that was Cyprus, where during the worst of the crisis Germany was bailing out other countries' banks, for fear that one going down would endanger the others. But when it came to Cyprus's turn, the country was small enough and the other European banks healthy enough that they knew they could let them go without setting off the bank runs all over Europe that ZeroHedge was predicting.

I'll post a proper announcement about this when I launch, but I'm building an "oracle" service that will allow you to settle bets directly on the blockchain. Basically for a given fact at a given future date we give you a public key, and we only release the private key of the outcome that actually happens.
We can handle data from any publicly-available API with reasonable Terms of Service, so for example if you can formulate a proposition in Freebase, which covers pretty much everything in the known universe, you'll be able to bet on it, if you can find someone to bet with.
I'm then hoping that somebody will build a service that matches people who want to bet with each other and helps them set up their bets as multi-sig contracts on the blockchain, and we'll have proper p2p prediction markets with nobody holding our funds for us.

At the consumer level the Japanese alternatives to bitcoin for domestic payments are quite good. 
Bank transfers via online banking are quick and cheap - often free if you're moving money within the same bank, and most people use one of a small number of banks, so a merchant can have an account at each the main ones. For face-to-face transactions there are some quite nice electronic money systems, especially the pasmo / suica smart cards that people were already using for the trains.
I reckon the places where Bitcoin should be useful for Japanese people are things like:
* Overseas remittances, or payments to overseas sites, although most people don't do those very often.
* Online porn / gambling that you don't want showing up on your bank statement. The hitch is that this that requires you to be able to easily buy the bitcoins in the first place, preferably without verification.
* Supporting the ancient Japanese tradition of having secret savings that you hide from your spouse.

I agree with most of this (apart from the Dogecoin point, which is a bit mad), and I think a lot of my friends in the bitcoin community are being too complacent about the difficulty of the hurdles we have to cross to get to mass adoption.
Having said that, the difference between being a single company's product and an open protocol is very important here. Having also been involved in trying to build stuff on Second Life, we were seriously hampered by Linden Lab's failures, particularly their pricing, which has heroically resisted any concession to Moore's Law for nearly a decade, and their epically appalling customer service.
Bitcoin use has been also seriously affected by unreliable vendors and exchanges, but the crap ones are gradually being out-competed by more competent ones. That means there's a lot more hope that the friction points will be fixed.

I understood the point but I don't think it's right. Liberty Reserve moved to Costa Rica but the US still caught up with them. If we were talking about small miners then the combination of whack-a-mole and regulatory arbitrage would make government action irrelevant, but for larger players it's a much more expensive and difficult proposition. A much cheaper and simpler proposition would be just to sell half your business to somebody else, and act go back to being a p2p node instead of a payment processor.
@_date: 2013-12-27 04:38:43
We're not just talking about little mining operations, we're talking about quite sizable businesses. If they grow big enough to turn themselves into the regulatory equivalent of Liberty Reserve, they're going to have the same problems running that Liberty Reserve did. Maybe they can get away with it or maybe they can't. But the difference is that unlike Liberty Reserve, they have the option of shrinking or selling off part of their business to make the regulatory problem go away. 
Put differently, if big miners turn out have a bunch of potentially expensive regulatory headaches that small miners don't, smaller miners should be about to out-compete them.

IIUC Intrade shut down their US markets after getting sued for selling unlicensed futures contracts on commodities. The regulatory problem was that rather than sticking to politics and sports, they offered contracts on the price of gold and oil. Commodities futures are a traditional, regulated activity, and they weren't following the regulations. 
It's good to see Bitcoin businesses doing this, but to reduce the risk to their customers it might be better if they were a bit more specialized. Predictious have markets on politics, sports, showbiz, bitcoin companies and the value of bitcoin. The latter sounds like it might be a commodity, in which case they've got the same problem with the US regulators that Intrade did. These potentially all have different regulatory issues, and it would be a shame if they had to shut down the whole thing because of one not particularly important market. The community would be better having one exchange for politics, another one for sports, another one for Bitcoin values, etc etc.

That would be the sensible way to handle it, but it's not clear that this is what's meant. 
The issue seems to be that there are VAT exemptions in German law that mean you don't have to charge VAT if you sell someone another currency, so if you go to a bureau de change and buy 100 Euros worth of dollars, you get that many dollars, rather than having 19 Euros worth deducted. That's obviously the sensible way to deal with currency. But the problem is that Bitcoin doesn't fit the official definition of currency in that exemption, so if the bureau de change sold you bitcoins they may have to charge VAT on them.
There's some speculation here that although Bitcoins may not be VAT-exempt by virtue of being currency (which is apparently what this story is saying), they may be VAT-exempt for another reason:
It also seems like it should be possible to buy your Bitcoins in a way that doesn't put a VAT-eligible person on the other side of it. The thought is that you can buy from somebody who isn't selling Bitcoins professionally so they won't have to charge you VAT on the actual Bitcoins, and you'll only have to pay VAT on your exchange fee. That's what Karl-Friedrich_Lenz suggests here:
There are also some interesting problems if a VAT-registered business gets paid in Bitcoins then wants to sell them for Euros. Again, it sounds like there may be some workarounds, like "exporting" your bitcoins to a buyer outside the EU.
@_date: 2013-12-30 13:09:29

@_date: 2013-12-30 04:12:24
Right, that's what I'm aiming for. The nice thing about this is that you can add as many redundant layers of trust as you like. For example, you might routinely require two out of buyer + seller + me, so the buyer and seller could settle without me. But you could also add my competitor (I don't think I have one yet, but if it's popular I will) and/or some traditional, expensive human dispute-resolution-type key escrow that you would only have to call on if everything else went wrong.
Edit to add: I heard that somebody - was it at MIT? - was trying to build a prediction market where arbitration was also p2p. In theory it should be possible to replace anything with "trusted arbitor" with "p2p network of consensus witnesses". But in practice it sounds hard.

@_date: 2013-12-30 06:03:33


Possibly. But it maybe that a cheap micro-transaction solution will involve trade-offs with other bitcoin features, like network distribution or mining power (and hence security), in which case they could both co-exist.
The way this could end up killing Bitcoin is if an alt-coin comes up with a good solution for cheaper transactions, the bitcoin community (and miners in particular) don't accept that trade-off and refuse to adopt it, but it turns out that users value low transaction cost more than they value the things Bitcoin is optimized for. Then by the time the Bitcoin community has figured this out and decided respond, the world has already moved on.

The site is really nicely done, very clear and easy to use. But the choice of markets is very odd. They do all these commodities-like things that are exactly the kind of thing that screwed Intrade, even though hardly anyone seems to actually use them. Meanwhile there are hardly any political markets on anything happening soon; There was nothing on the Australian general election, for example.

That said:

OK, here's a thought experiment. Say the banknote had a little box on it that, when held up to the light, magically changed colour if the banknote had been stolen. Wouldn't the person from whom it had been stolen then have a claim that you had been reckless in accepting the banknote, because had you taken the simple precaution of holding it up to the light, you would have known it was stolen?
Now for "magical little box", substitute "real-time online blacklist". It feels like once someone has made it possible to trivially check for theft, we may all be obligated to use their system, for fear that a court will order us to hand over our money to some previous owner.
This would obviously be disastrous for bitcoin, but it's not obvious that the court that brought about this disaster would be doing its job incorrectly.
The practical solution is for the community to do whatever it can to sabotage these blacklists and get them showing as many false positives as possible. If non-stolen banknotes light up as well as stolen ones, it ceases to be reckless to ignore it when they light up.

Not my thing but that looks nice. Are you able to buy codes and sell Bitcoins as well as selling codes and buying bitcoins? That would effectively allow people to buy bitcoins anonymously in convenience stores...

I think the press coverage said they're in Ireland, so if they've got US customers that puts them in the same situation as Intrade, except that they take bitcoins instead of dollars.

Article by John Lyons, chief executive of something called the International Cyber Security Protection Alliance.
Clearly what they're proposing wouldn't be effective against criminal activity, as it's not technically possible to stop criminals using Bitcoin. What they could do is affect legitimate use of Bitcoin, reducing the threat of price competition to the current incumbent, VISA.
VISA is one of their member companies. 
So it strikes me that some questions worth asking here would be:
1) How much money has VISA given the ICSPA?
2) What conversations, if any, have VISA representatives had with John Lyons about Bitcoin?
Apparently ICSPA is hoping to be funded by the EU, so if ICSPA so any more lobbying like this it might be worth contacting EU Parliament members and domestic legislators involved in scrutiny of EU issues to see how they feel about funding a lobbying organization which is representing the interests of an American financial services corporation, against the interests of EU businesses and consumers.

Put another way, the risk is that there will be scalability problems that are technically solvable, but for community political reasons bitcoin is unable to adopt them. The blocksize limit is a case where the solution is obvious but it's still hard to get the necessary consensus. In future there may be other solutions like sharding that could help bitcoin grow, but people won't be able to agree on them.
If the political process fails badly enough, the world will switch to an alt-chain or an alternative currency that takes the decisions the bitcoin community couldn't.
