Help me understand why.


So this technology exists in a future where everyone is driving new cars, in country's whose governments have accepted such back-door access to vehicles as being ok? What are the infrastructure costs of adding such a system?


I heard that when LegalZoom went online, but it only applied to low-hanging legal fruit.


I wish their website better explained how it handles this. I've used AirBnb quite a bit and sometimes there are problems. Generally, it comes to what amenities were offered as part of the deal, and whether their absence constitutes a breach of contract. Or what if I use AirBnb consecutively for X amount of days which, in the jurisdiction the property is located in, I now have tenancy in the room. Under the AirBnb contract, upon its expiration, I have no right to be there -- but under the law, I would need to be evicted.
I know I'm being nitpicky -- but law is nitpicky.


So... lawyers? But blockchain specific, developer lawyers?

Two things...
First: I'm saying the purpose of a contract is to provide a record of what parties agree to so that, if necessary, a court can step in and resolve problems. Contracts basically exist for when shit doesn't go as planned... because if no one has a problem at the end of a relationship, then it generally doesn't matter whether or not a contract was in play. Contract lawyers essentially exist to guard against realities that everyone hopes won't happen, or even just to provide guidelines to reference so that future-parties know how to act. This can get complicated... so I'm not sure how it can be done in a way that side-steps the utility/value of an attorney without risking parties being left with a contract that is worthless and unenforceable by courts.
Second: I'm not so much focused on the "legality" of the blockchain records as much as I am talking about the legality of the agreements themselves. There are plenty of contracts that have no legal enforceability and, when brought to court, are thrown out. We can write up a contract right now that clearly states, in exchange for 100 bitcoins, you will give me the right to your first born child. I can transfer those coins to you. You can take possession of them. When you have your child, though, my contract doesn't circumvent the reality that I can't enforce such an agreement.
Contracts are hopeful agreements between parties that, when they end up going against the law or public policy, can get invalidated... in whole or in part. So I'm curious how smart contracts deal with the real-world, non-binary, subjective reality that law and contracts deal with every day in court or arbitration.

Ironically, figuring out all these parameters is basically the job of an attorney.

While there are undoubtedly parts of law that are capable of being translated to algorithms and code -- the big, meaty stuff that matters and makes the world go-round is based on relationships and engagement of minds.
I spent about 15 hours this week dealing with opposing counsel over the difference between "and" vs. "or" in a contract worth about $5 MM. If there is a future where a programmer can come up with a way to save me those hours, I'm all for it... but it's just not realistic.
What i'm learning from these comments and feedback is that while smart contracts will be able to do a lot of cool things, it isn't as revolutionary as the Internet itself (a claim i've run into from a couple supporters lately).

Any recommendations on what's worth a read? I like technical documents, and I have more and more entrepreneurs hitting me up about this and I'd like to do more than frustrate them with "it doesn't work that way."
Also... how does this deal with the fact that the computers/servers running this code, those decentralized, may end up largely under the power of a single sovereign? Like if we did put our nuclear codes up in the blockchain, isn't it susceptible to government interference or forking?
@_date: 2017-07-27 00:04:18


How would that be authenticated without a centralized authority?
@_date: 2017-07-26 23:39:07
Thanks! I'll post this there tomorrow.

I haven't read that specifically -- but it appears to be in the same universe of other examples/write-ups I have read... which leaves me with the same questions of "How?" Like, it feels like the examples I come across drop the reader into some theoretically midway point where infrastructure and laws already exist to accommodate the use of such a system, but that doesn't help me understand how we get to that point.
I can't watch the video yet, but I'll give it a look.

This is **highly** inefficient. In normal contracts, a 3rd party is only necessary when someone has a problem with an outcome... but now we have to find a third party to verify every transaction which is not a negligible cost. Sounds like these transactions will necessitate a type of arbitrator for each contract (which will require licensign and what not from an authority). It's just... more complications that in no way sounds superior to how these transactions work now.
Like under what circumstances does what you're describing sound ideal? Perhaps in an area where the government is so crooked that you want to avoid courts entirely but for some reason can trust some impartial third party?

I tried that first, but their automoderator deleted my post (which is basically copy/pasta of this) because it "discussed pricing". I found that sub to be a silly place, so I figured I'd see what you fine folks have to say.
It appears I may never understand smart contracts lol
@_date: 2017-07-26 23:38:08


From a practical sense, though, that's not how it works. Property rights are an extension of a higher-authority's recognition of those rights. If the blockchain says you own a widget, but a court finds that the widget belongs to me -- your blockchain has no ability to prevent me from seizing your property which becomes my property.
Failure to hand over whatever keys are necessary to give me access to it (assuming it has some sort of smart lock on it) just means I go after whatever other assets you have to cover the cost of reverse-engineering that lock or removing that system, etc. etc.
That's where my mind keeps going. I hear the example you gave often, but when I play that out in my head, I don't see how it avoids the day-to-day issues where people have contracts that say "This is how it will be," yet a court finds the opposite.

That's fair and I appreciate the push back. I'll give his stuff a read. I hope to be super impressed with this and be able to understand the hype better because I fee like I'm dangerously close to being one of those people in the 90's who didn't see the potential of the Internet. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 00:13:54
I appreciate the link -- I'll add it to my list to watch.
On a side note -- I hate how all the videos on this are over an hour long... though, I guess if it were simpler to explain perhaps I wouldn't be so confused =P

I'll check it out!


I wish it explained that. Honestly, I'm totally okay with attorney's being replaced with A.I. and know that we are 1 algorithm away from unemployment... but I have yet to see an explanation of how that is feasible.
That article was one of the first I came across, and it is ridiculous. Take the first part:


That's not how it works. Are there some attorneys who work like vending machines? Sure -- but they are already losing business to things like LegalZoom and represent only a portion of the jobs attorneys do. That example makes me question the author's competency on the subject.
Maybe I'm expecting too much, or maybe the purpose of that article is just to skim the surface, but nothing about it makes me feel like the author knows what they are talking about vs. just vaguely describing how stuff might work on a very wishy-washy theoretical level.
I would be super skeptical of anything that says "you no longer need an attorney" when it comes to business dealings. Even if blockchain records become the de facto best way to track legal dealings, someone needs to craft agreements to be within the ever-changing bounds of the law.
Or maybe the purpose of smart contracts is to just be like the example says... vending-machine style deals? But if that's all, then I don't get the hype about how they'll change everything.

I work at a venture capital development firm. We handle a lot of projects, and are pitched even more. Moreover, I've been in the startup world for more than a decade.
With that said, I have never come across any development project which would be similar to what you're describing. I agree that what you're describing would be the ideal type of development project for these types of contracts... but I am not sure where such a project would exist other than theoretical


I'm still not getting that impression based off what I'm reading in this thread.


Can you elaborate?
@_date: 2017-07-26 23:33:00


Their auto-mod deleted my post. Maybe they'll undelete it at some point, but there doesn't seem to be much activity going on in there, so I hedged and posted here too.


That's kinda what my gut is telling me thus far. I **love** contracts. Contract law is my favorite flavor of law. I find it fascinating how well the world has evolved around it and vice versa.
From what I've seen so far, "Smart Contracts" are simply "automated escrow." But I don't want to be unfair to the tech if I am just not getting it... I just struggle to find someone to help me understand what's so apparently amazing about it (the blockchain folks in my area gush about it quite a bit as the second-coming of the Internet itself).
This is a good write-up, I only glanced through it but I'll give it more attention tomorrow. It doesn't seem to dive into the objective issues on how to verify contracts though. I see it talk about releasing tokens to folks when a task is completed... but I'm interested in the complexity of defining a task and authentication of how it is completed.
For example, if I hire a developer to code me something, I would never agree to some automated escrow system to decide whether or not the developer's final product is within the bounds of what we had agreed to. Even if I pay someone to "go to the grocery store and buy me an apple," at what point does the blockchain know that I received the apple, or how do I compensate the purchaser if apples are twice as expensive as they usually are, etc. etc.
Contracts are beautiful things that generally never get attention because most deals work out fine... but when they don't, they matter a lot.
@_date: 2017-07-27 02:07:36


All the more reason for me to figure this out ;)
@_date: 2017-07-27 02:09:25
It's not the math that confuses me -- it's the logic and understanding of how law functions in society. I get that the creator of smart contracts has a legal background, but I'm not impressed by his writings yet, or convinced he knows what he's talking about re: practical applications of the tech he created.
