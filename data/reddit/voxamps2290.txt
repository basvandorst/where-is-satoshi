Yes, lol. For sure gave me a good laugh.

Fees aren't this high so not even sure what you are talking about.
If you are going through Coinbase, your fee should be $1.

You are arguing semantics here. He sold bitcoin and gifted you cash. He owes capital gains.

Each transaction triggers a calculation of gain/loss. So as an example on your Schedule D (not using actual prices, just easy amounts for simplicity):
You bought 1 BTC on January 1, 2016 for $100.
You exchanged 1 BTC (current value $500) on January 2, 2017 for 1 ETH currently valued at $500. You have a long-term capital gain to report on your 2017 tax return of $400 ($500 ETH - $100 purchase price of BTC).
On March 31, 2017, you exchange 1 ETH (valued you at $10,000) for 1 BTC (also valued at $10,000). You have a short-term capital gain of $9,500 to report on your 2017 tax return.
If the exchanges occur over the course of more than 1 year (1 sale in 2017, 1 sale in 2018), the date sold is the tax year you report the capital gain/loss.

Cloud mining is fuzzy. I am also not as familiar with it. 
You essentially front money to someone which goes into a pool of fronted money, and whatever they mine is then split based on your contribution %?
That sounds more like you would have basis of $300 and pay gains on whatever you sell at.

This $10,000 is also FDIC insured...
Is your bitcoin insured?

I am confused by what you are asking. Could you please rephrase or elaborate?
If you are referring to day traders that aren't in the business of buying/selling you are no different than an investor like me.
If you are referring to day traders that are in the business of buying/selling you open up a new can of worms in terms of taxability in the USA.

It's actually one of the most likely scenarios of people shorting.
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:26:27
No. I see it more as a legitimizing event.

On Bittrex, did you exchange bitcoin for altcoin or did you simply purchase more coins on bittrex?
Things to track would be purchase date, purchase amount in $, purchase amount # of coins (even fractional), sell date, proceeds from sales.
Track all of the above even if you are doing high volume trading.

Having cash is important (liquidity/everyday expenses/emergency fund). Your point implies that you would personally never carry any cash in a bank account because it loses money, which is just reckless.

I don't think so as I don't think they are registered with the SEC, so the SEC doesn't regulate them.

Mining has completely different tax consequences than just buying bitcoin.
Miners have to pick up self-employment income as you receive the bitcoin you mined. As an example, let's say that $300 ends up giving you 1 bitcoin. When you receive that bitcoin, you have to pay self-employment taxes on whatever the FMV (fair market value) is at the time of receiving, on top of picking the FMV up in income. This establishes your basis in the bitcoin.
On the flip side, you can just purchase bitcoin with after tax dollars and your basis is whatever you paid. If you are in it to earn a nice ROI, honestly just buy it. You aren't investing in bitcoin for 4%-10% gains. You want the 100%-1000% gains.

Stop with the click bait titles.

You already have to pay taxes when exchanging crypto for crypto.
The rules on like-kind exchange specifically say stocks and bonds are disallowed, which is the closest thing crypto resembles (stocks). Good luck arguing like-kind exchange to the IRS to defer gain.
"Finally, certain types of property are specifically excluded from Section 1031 treatment. Section 1031 does not apply to exchanges of:
Inventory or stock in trade
Stocks, bonds, or notes
Other securities or debt
Partnership interests
Certificates of trust"
Crypto is either inventory in the eyes of a miner or a stock/other security in the eyes of an investor.

I am sort of lost on your question. He "gifts" it to you, you give him possession of the gift to sell, then he gives you the cash. This looks completely fishy which is why my original comment of him selling the bitcoin and gifting you cash still applies.
A good example would be of appreciated stock. If I gift you appreciated stock, but you let me retain ownership to sell, the IRS sees that the stock was sold under my name using my SSN. I would pay tax and ultimately gift you the cash.
At the end of the day, you will either pay the tax or he will based on the IRS rules of appreciated asset gifting. If the gift is something that has appreciated in value, the person receiving the gift inherits the gift giver's basis.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:59:35
You certainly could make that argument. I think your point about the ambiguity, in my opinion, goes in your favor.
Ultimately, the IRS just wants to see bitcoin sales reported on tax returns and to receive the tax owed.

While I know little about tax code outside of the USA, it might help to tell people the exact country as tax code can vary greatly from country to country.

When you exchange crypto for crypto, that is a taxable event. So when keeping track of information, if you sold $10K of Bitcoin and bought $10K of ETH, you are paying taxes on the $10K sale of bitcoin (if you sold at a gain). With your reversal of altcoin to bitcoin, you would do the same thing with taxes.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:11:55
No problem. There is a lot of misinformation going around about the taxability of cryptocurrency, which could ultimately be a huge downfall for crypto in markets like the USA if people are evading taxes.

Any time you make a sale, you report that on Schedule D of your tax return, unless you are in the business of buying/selling. There are specific rules to qualify as a trader.
You only pay 41% on that if that is the tax bracket you are in (I assume the 41% you are referring to is the highest marginal bracket + ACA medicare tax which would actually be 43.4%). I can't attest to exactly what you would pay since I don't know your full situation.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:47:12
If you consider it a commodity (the IRS does not) it doesn't even qualify for like-kind in the first place.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:13:45
Please don't take this advice and evade taxes, it is a felony in the USA and comes with severe consequences. Please stay within the law and **AVOID** taxes by using loopholes within the law.

Not to mention an IRA (depending on what brokerage you use) has access to many low cost ETFs, whereas an employer sponsored plan might not have the best options.

Gambling is not pure luck. For example, blackjack/poker have specific odds of events occurring. That is not luck. Depending on house rules for blackjack, your odds of winning can near 50%.
Bitcoin is a whole different beast than traditional investing in companies, which is why people probably define it as gambling. When you invest in company stock, there are certain measurable factors that go into predicting the future. There definitely is some luck in investing, but the point is you do your due diligence before investing in a company, hoping your measurable are an indication of future performance.
Bitcoin is investing, albeit at the most extreme end. Bitcoin is nothing like a company. Bitcoin doesn't pay dividends, bitcoin doesn't issues quarterly earnings reports, bitcoin doesn't have a balance sheet. You are investing in the technology and the idea.
For you to think there is 0% luck involved in investing might be an indication of your delusion.

You are investing wrong if you are worried about "monthly fees" and "initial paying fees" and "other bullshit" for stocks.
What I mean is, you should be investing in ETFs and mutual funds. Or use Robinhood for commission free trading.
Robinhood is nearly as simple as Coinbase, except you have to know which stock you want to buy and search for it.
