Please stop torturing me!
@_date: 2016-04-26 18:14:27
Yes, just payed, so cool :)
@_date: 2016-04-26 04:15:38
I am located in Austria, still nothing :(
@_date: 2016-04-25 22:57:56
Just restarted Steam after reading your comment. It's not here for me :/
Oh well, I'm gonna check again tomorrow.
@_date: 2016-04-25 22:52:47
Any news on when it's gonna be live in Europe?

Of yourse that's huge news and all, but to be fair, it's not like you can't buy steam games with Bitcoin already. I know you can pay in Bitcoin on g2a and I'm sure there is other options too (also saw the first Steam codes on Open Bazaar).
@_date: 2017-03-20 17:58:39
So how did it play out?
@_date: 2017-03-20 21:06:43
I see, bummer.

It's hard if the_Donald voting army are sending all of their shitposts through the roof.
@_date: 2016-06-13 13:16:21
they might also win, just less
@_date: 2016-06-24 19:28:22
Time to buy pounds, tomorrow they realise it's not that big of a deal after all.
@_date: 2016-06-14 15:05:23
same here, plus wants to buy herself.
@_date: 2016-06-25 12:53:07
NEVER buy more than you can afford to ~~loose.~~ lose.
If you believe the rather optimistic interpretation of what is happening, which is that we are in the [bear trap stage of a bubble]( then yes. 
There are also very reasonable voices that say we already hit the bubble peak and all the foreseeable positive events (in terms of price) that lie ahead of us are already calculated into the price right now. If you believe the latter, then no.
@_date: 2016-06-13 13:22:21
It's a bit like asking "Is the temperature only changing once an hour or does it fluctuate 24/7?"
The answer is: The price fluctuates and is updated however often the different sites decide to update it. To answer your last question: I would recommend a site that takes many different exchanges into account, like [bitcoinaverage]( for example.

As a fellow European I am glad I only have a reasonable amount of my capital stored Euros.

I hate what censorship does to reddit, it used to be one of those places where you were told to fuck off when you couldn't handle free speech. 
Now freedom of speech turned into freedom *from* speech.
@_date: 2018-10-05 10:27:22
Is there a chart of Bitcoins fluctiuation across multiple normalised FIAT currencies? Does my question make sense?
@_date: 2016-06-25 16:00:01
Yeah, that's what my English teacher used to tell us every lesson, also the difference between differ and distinguish, still get those wrong aswell :P
@_date: 2016-12-23 07:31:20
Sorry, you have nothing to be sorry aboot.
@_date: 2016-12-23 20:58:18
1. I know
2. Austrian (Europe, no kangoroos)
3. Just making a joke
4. Sorry
@_date: 2016-12-04 13:13:50
I'd do it too but shipping to Europe probs not worth it.
@_date: 2016-11-17 17:30:19
Obviously. I just told you.
@_date: 2015-07-11 15:23:46
If they asked you for a private key, you probably haven't been on the right site! Keep in mind that some sites look exactly the same and some even manage to display the same url!
If they didn't ask, then ... yeah ... why?
@_date: 2015-07-26 16:12:05
It isn't but there is no real insurance at any other "digital" place to keep all kinds of money either, I suppose.
@_date: 2015-07-11 14:58:30
I wonder if that actually spreads the word about Bitcoin in Greece or if just people who are already well informed/already using Bitcoin will use that service.
Also, is it possible to buy everyday good with Bitcoin in Greece?
@_date: 2018-11-22 13:48:44
2019 coming up...
@_date: 2019-01-17 07:22:59
I first thought the gravestones were depicting logos of other cryptos, which would also be an accurate picture.
@_date: 2015-10-27 18:01:49
Yes, that is because I am absolutely convinced that r/Bitcoin is full of weightlifting, lactose-intolerant vegans.
@_date: 2015-10-28 09:22:11
I actually would be happy to, but to be honest, I lack ideas of what alternatives I could offer her. Let's take shopify for example, it'd cost 20€/per month, she is thinking about selling the book for 2-3€, so she would need to sell 10 just to be even, which might not be a problem in the first month, but definitely could be come month 2. :S
@_date: 2016-05-27 22:55:51
@_date: 2015-03-31 09:07:35
I don't think anyone would pay just for *learning* those things, but people will likely pay you for actually **doing** those things for them.
But hey, have a cookie @_date: 2015-03-22 12:07:46
What you can already do is buy local currency with bitcoin using something like localbitcoins.com and probably save yourself quite some exchange fees.
EDIT: Just saw that already brought that up.
@_date: 2015-10-27 17:45:35
I see your points, here my two cents: Maybe I should have pointed out that I never pushed her to solely accept Bitcoin, just to *also* accept it, the "solely" thing was her own idea, which - as I pointed out - I explained the downsides to this "strategy" to her.
Half of the payment providers you listed are US only, the other half can only be implemented (easily) in a website by using (somewhat) costly "store-page-providers" like e-junkie.
Also, rest assured, that her expectations are quite realistic and she is actually quite convinced she will have a hard time selling a single copy even with PayPal or such, so there are no dreams being built on that book that could be shattered, it's more just a hobby-experiment-thing.
@_date: 2015-10-27 18:12:33
By the time this is out, you and everyone else here will long have forgotten about it ;)
THEN I POST IT AGAIN!!!
@_date: 2015-10-28 05:34:41
Haha, will do. As easy as the concept of exchange rates is, I find it funny to see how a lot of people are struggling to believe how much BTC they would have to spend for - let's say - a 100 € shopping spree.
@_date: 2015-10-27 18:48:36
I made it a spoiler instead of link, that why it isn't working.
She isn't vegan, on the contrary, she is a powerlifter and therefore values her protein, but it's a dessert cookbook for people with all kinds of problems, so some are vegan, some are gluten-free, some only use air and almond flour or whatever ;-P
the adress is theironangel.co
@_date: 2015-10-28 12:29:51
Well PayPal is dead to her because she refuses to come back to them begging, I will definitely take a look at "pay-per-download" services today though, allthough I hear they can be quite scammy.
@_date: 2016-05-27 20:52:27


Can someone please explain what this is?
@_date: 2015-03-22 14:47:10
Yeah, the world is full of Bitcoin-murderers, hardly a day goes by where we don't hear about another case of cold-blooded murder over some Satoshi.
I think taking a taxi (also a stranger) is more dangerous than buying Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-17 17:22:39
xD Thanks!
@_date: 2018-12-18 06:55:45
I'm actually a righty. and thanks :)
@_date: 2018-12-17 17:22:25
Cheers mate!
@_date: 2018-12-17 19:22:57
Eat more - as in "almost exclusively" - vegetables.
@_date: 2018-12-17 19:23:15
Thanks :)
@_date: 2018-12-18 06:56:10
@_date: 2018-12-18 06:53:49
Thanks mate, appreciate it! :)
@_date: 2018-12-17 16:03:43
I got it from [here]( probably like 4 years ago.
@_date: 2018-12-17 19:35:57
@_date: 2018-12-17 13:54:46
Absolutely, please buy BTC so I can eat!
@_date: 2018-12-17 19:24:57
Thanks, yeah, people say holding (pun not intended) is even harder than losing. I hope I have my habits changed for good though.
