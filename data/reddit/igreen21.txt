From the capitulation we return to the mean and then keep a slow growth... not directly ATH, despite AstroDoge saying so

would be nice to have something to control the node remotely

Does this app and the lnd node have to be installed on the same machine?
@_date: 2018-05-31 08:02:34
I didn't assume it, I was sating the oposite.

Wow just commented something in r/btc , not even too hard on BCH and got a lot of downvotes...

Thats a true trader :)

Those fibonacci levels are not very well positioned. Also de MACD and EMA should have a longer period. 
The time-frame should be longer with 4h candle sticks which represents the market sentiment more.
The ABC waves are well positioned but they could not be accurate if we take into account the latest retracement levels given.
Despite that, my TA also conclude that BTC is a fucking dinosaur!!!

has this been verified?
@_date: 2018-02-22 10:57:28
This one, but it seems a bit deprecated (or so they say)

Its stopping at same block height all the time when synchronising the bitcoin node :S did you manage to set it up?
