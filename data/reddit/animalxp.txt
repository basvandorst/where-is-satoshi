These are only cards issued by WaveCrest because WaveCrest is a shit company that didn't comply with VISA rules.  VISA is not blocking bitcoin debit cards, they're blocking WaveCrest issued cards (bitcoin or otherwise).  That's what happens when you (WaveCrest) can't get your shit together.

Personally... I have background in auditing PCI (payment card industry) compliance and if VISA had a problem, it is likely that MasterCard will also have a problem with them.  It will come down to if MasterCard wants to enforce their own rules.  They're sort of a small fish in the game and often not willing to throw out any revenue streams if they can help it... so, I would say that there's only a 60% chance that MasterCard will also be dumping them.
The bigger issue is that if you have a WaveCrest issued card, you should look for a different service provider.  There is clearly something to worry about if VISA dumped a revenue stream over it.  That "something" is very likely related to the security of either your funds or your identifying information.

Coinbase multisig has three keys.  One that coinbase still holds.  One that was encrypted with a password that YOU chose.  And one that you downloaded.  The encrypted key is still w/Coinbase and you had the option to download it locally if you wanted to.  As a minimum, you have to provide the password to decrypt that key.  Also, Coinbase did not provide you a copy of THEIR key.  So, you have two keys (at least one is encrypted) and something else?  The something else maybe be the public address of the vault so that you can send additional funds to it?

EVERYTHING will think they have the next big thing.  99.9% of them are pure shit.  Most are people tweaking the existing code of some other coin for the purpose of a pump and dump.   ALSO, they will all have the bestest programmers backed by billionaires who will guarantee to get the coin off the launch pad.  That is also pure shit.  Again, MOST of them are going to be idiots hoping to run a pump and dump.

If you know the password for the shared key, just go onto Coinbase's website and retrieve you stuff from the vault.  It takes a couple days (and you need access to the two email addresses used)... but that will get the value back into a hot wallet for you.
Reading again... your "4. Shared seed" is prob the encrypted private key that you and Coinbase share.  Your "5. User seed" is probably the private key that only you have (no idea of if you chose to encrypt or not).  The password is likely the encryption password.  Look at using some local wallet (maybe electrum offline?) to see if instructions are available for sweeping a multi-sig address into the local wallet.

Confirmation bias makes us ignore stuff that conflicts with our current belief and put HUGE value in stuff that supports our current belief.  When you reject his "evidence" for his beliefs you are rejected him in a sense.  (So, a bit like calling him AND his dad assholes not worthy of the tribe).  
When people get dug in, the best thing to do (if you value the friendship) is to say "Thanks for that info, I'll think about it" and let it die.  If you want to break a bad belief system, you will need to let them discover for themselves that it is bad.  Pushing against it will only strengthen it.

From my read, there is concern over the heated run up going on.  One "ministry" wants to ban it, but another one (or maybe two) ministry says that is not possible because it's too restrictive (like maybe against their 'constitution') and if they ban it, money will leave S.Korea to buy it on foreign exchanges in the US and Japan.
The largest shopping mall in S.Korea just recently bitcoin enabled all their shops.  The largest bank in S.Korea recently started offering bitcoin vault services.  The largest ATM manufacturer has enabled ATMs to sell bitcoin using only a software upgrade.  That same mfg is responsible for a lot of the ATMs in US gas stations and the like.  That software upgrade will soon be available to US ATMs as well.
S.Korea has a multi-year history of being pro-blockchain and pro-crypto currencies. Their concern right now is if it is in a bubble and that bubble breaks how to deal with the sudden loss of wealth to so many people.

if you buy $600 worth of bitcoin... say that gave you .05 BTC.  You now hold .05 BTC.  The price of bitcoin goes up so that that .05 BTC is now worth $1000.  You now have $1000 worth of BTC without doing anything.  If you were to sell $500 WORTH of BTC, you would be left with .025 BTC (one half of what you had before)...

First, you can always just leave it on the exchange.  I personally have a Coinbase account and am totally fine with leaving BTC on that exchange. That will save you the transfer fees and the risk of something going wrong with your paper wallet.
As you said, you're not savvy.  If you leave it on the exchange, you can try out the paper wallet concept with $20 worth of BTC instead of risking all of it.  Again, I personally would recommend you pick a reputable company as an exchange and not go the paper wallet route.

I would say avoid Antonio Smith The Sellionaire Coach Tony at all costs.  This is exactly how scams are laid out.
- Bitcoin is not a "business" Mr Antonio Smith The Sellionaire Coach Tony
- Bitcoin is a new technology, so does not have any prior "proven models" (OH, and that's a quick way to piss away money into a business anyway.  If you're just paying for a franchise type thing... you'll quickly be bleeding money in all directions.  Just ask the MILLIONS of Amway tycoons out there... oh, that's right there aren't that many out there are there Mr Antonio Smith The Sellionaire Coach Tony?
- Why would someone risk even $1 with Mr Antonio Smith The Sellionaire Coach Tony who talks out of his ass like this?  If he is willing to talk out of his ass on bitcoin (and he clearly doesn't even know what it is)... then you can bet he's talking out of his ass over what ever else he's trying to sell you under his Antonio Smith The Sellionaire Coach Tony name.

Plus they pre-mine the crap out of them, so it makes it a bit of a pitch game in order for them to get their pay off.  Bitcoin was sort of "pre-mined" by the Satoshi 1 million coins, but they've been dead and no one know who "Satoshi" is and there is been no influence by Statoshi (under that name) in a very, very long time.
I think ETH pre-mined 12 million coins for the devs and additional coins for other purposes (maybe 60 million?).  By comparison, LiteCoin (first alt-coin) pre-mined 150 coins.

Then the news hounds all decided to go batshit crazy about it for some reason and Coinbase got flooded with new accounts/new buyers that drove it into a spike.  If you look back at Nov 1 moon math tables, you should be back in black by end of Jan (IF the growth slows back down to that level).  Right now, without the spike, but at the current growth rate, you should be back in black by end of month, if not end of next week.

A Nov 19 survey of 10k Japanese people found 88% have heard of bitcoin, but only 4% had purchased it.  Bitcoin exchanges are advertised on their normal TV stations.  15 Exchanges have been approved to operate with at least 4 more requesting licenses to operate.  Japan is the leading country driving current demand.
Coinbase has moved to top downloaded iOS app with 1 in 5 millennials familiar with bitcoin.  In the US, there is Coinbase and Gemini and the Japanese company BitFlyer has recently opened up US operations.

If you don't need to send bitcoin while away from your computer, don't put any apps on your phone that are linked to any accounts holding your bitcoin.  I personally have a PNG file on my phone with a receive address QR code that I can display through the gallery (android).  That's it.  Someone wants to send me bitcoin, I let them scan that.
Then I have Samourai's Sentinel to watch prices.  (There is a "Bitcoin Sentinel" that comes up first w/blue motif... that's not what I use.  I use the organge motif looking "Sentinel" by "Samourai")
There is no reason to hold private keys on any computer system if you're not sending bitcoin anywhere. I looked at hardware wallets and they don't thrill me in the least. So, I have my seed and keys stored in a different way.  You can use electrum to bring up a "watch wallet" that contains no private keys and that will monitor when you're receiving transactions.
I use Coinbase and think that they are perfectly fine compared to what's out there.  I've been with them since 2014 and have never had a problem. I also do not use gambling site or dark web sites and I have no problem with verifying my identity.  Bitcoin provides for autonomy and that is what I support.  The blockchain is not anonymous and, knowing that the authorities have automated tools to piece together addresses associated with different organizations, I don't expect it to be.
My virus software is always updated and I never click shorted links or links to "one off" type blogs especially if they're advertising as bitcoin related.  If I were running an injection exploit, that is exactly how I'd run it... drawing in naive people who click on anything.

The "bitcoin" that is sold for $x is a token of value stored on the bitcoin blockchain (Bitcoin network) at a known address.  An address can hold any amount of bitcoin from 0.00000001 BTC to 20,999,999 BTC.  
If you're familiar with TCP/IP (the Internet's fundamental transport protocol), then the address is the same as an IP address and the bitcoin would be like the services available at that address (like a web server or a ftp server), only a bitcoin is a single value representing a set amount of bitcoin.  When you send bitcoin to that address, the value is increased.  When you send bitcoin from that address, the value is decreased. The current value is found by traversing the blockchain and accumulating all the transactions.  You can see representation of this by entering an address into the blockchain explorer at blockchain.info.
Here is an example of an address with transactions on it:

The $25 I gave a friend two weeks ago is now $35. Are you going to be a millionaire?  No, not in the near future.

I would cause a change in societal attitudes.  Now, people use currency as a measure of their worthiness... if currency were in a 100 year period of deflation, there will come a generation that has never known it to be inflationary.  At that point, that generation will value their worth in other things.  Like perhaps the creation of solutions to problems that plague people, flora, or fauna.  Or they may measure their value in services provided or in artistic endevors or in entertainment.
Right now, no one on earth has ever lived in a deflationary currency based society.  They can only envision a world based on what they are accustomed to.  That world measures their worth in terms of the amount of currency they control.

And, it's worth noting that they are not banned, but the manufacture of light bulbs must meet a certain efficiency that few incandescent lights now meet and those standards are ONLY for a specific set of light bulbs (like used in lamps) and not for any others (like stove lights or lights below or above a set wattage).

If you're paid in bitcoin, you do pay taxes on the income.  You just claim the dollar value of the income at the time of the transaction.  So, if someone paid 1.5BTC in Jan 2017 for a $1500 bill... that's $1500 in business income that needs to be claimed and taxes paid on it the year it happens.  If you eventually sell the bitcoin, that becomes capital gains income (the orig $1500 basis is subtracted from your capital gains)

I think there needs to be a distinction between autonomy and anonymity.  
The blockchain is insanely easy to crawl and there are already tools and service to identify connections.  Major addresses are always being documented (e.g. how do you think Coinbase knows when you send bitcoin to a gambling site?) and even sending to a different address is not very useful since tracking out two hops is only slightly more processing power than one hop.

1 - Easier to use.  The manufacturer of the second most frequent ATM in the US has had a software upgrade operating in their ATMs in South Korea for a while now.  The upgrade enables purchase of BTC without hardware changes.  They've recently said they're making that upgrade available to their non South Korean customers (their US Headquarters is in Texas).  If they can manage to print a receiving QR code on a receipt paper, they could potentially make selling BTC a software upgrade as well. (  )
2 - Retailers - I'm not as anxious for retailers like Walmart to adopt bitcoin at this point.  They will put a huge sell pressure on bitcoin because they'll be auto-converting to fiat.  I don't see Walmart doing it anytime soon just because of their culture and business ethics.  Walmart could easily provide check cashing services that included loading your money to a bitcoin address, except that would cut into their in-house sales of pre-paid debit cards.  I think Amazon will move long before they do.
4 "For example, in New York, all businesses that want to take bitcoin payments need to obtain a BitLicense, which costs $5,000 to apply for and comes with 500 pages of paperwork."  This is not correct.  If you want to sell muffins or socks for bitcoin, you can have at it.  The BitLicense is only for people operating like an exchange or custodian of bitcoin for others.
The top problems IMHO are user interface and speed of transactions.  I think if Lightning Network comes out of the gate with a VERY GOOD user interface and strong backend services that enable businesses to operate their own services that will be the biggest factor.  If the Lightning Network provided solid third party backend servers, then LN could easily eat into the pre-paid debit card industry.

They're under the exact same regulations as any other bank in the US. They've been around since 2013?  Maybe 2012?  And are now moving into fiduciary services for hedge funds (as in they'll hold the BTC for hedge funds).  They're the back end processor for Overstock and a bunch of other companies. They're not going to piss away a reputation half a decade in the making to run scams.  
Their customer service sucks.. but they're also growing at an insane rate.  I've been with them since 2014 and never had any problems with them.

Most **watch-only** wallets don't have the private keys in them.  That's why they're **watch-only**.  They know the public address and that's it.  Your actual bitcoin are at those public addresses embedded in the blockchain. So, deleting a **watch-only** wallet will not delete your bitcoin.
**NOTE:  FOR BEGINNERS** - Normal wallets contain your private keys.  If you lose the ability to restore your normal wallet (so lose your private keys) you lose the ability to send those bitcoin anywhere.  The above information is for WATCH ONLY wallets.  If you're not sure what type of wallet you have, do not delete it until you've made sure that you can restore it again later.

Of you could put your coin in their vault.  It's off line storage and takes something like 4 days and two email addresses to pull it back into the live wallet.  Now, their cold wallet could still be compromised by an insider, but it's not at risk to hacking of the live site.

Your source is from Apr 25, 2013 at 16:29 UTC.  That's four years ago when there were not very many properly managed exchanges and most were idiot kids who had modified templates.  That was in response to MtGox that was an exchange run by an idiot with access to enough money to get it off the ground.  None of his "technical staff" had any clue what they were doing.  It was a herd of idiots who were unregulated in any way duping people into using their service because they faked high volume on their exchange.  Then, surprise, surprise... they were "hacked" ... OMG... your shit show is falling apart and wouldn't you know.. "someone" stole all the bitcoin.

Electrum has a portable version of their wallet that doesn't interact with the operating system.  Why don't you download that... put it into a subdirectory (not where your current wallet is)... get your private seed address from the wallet you want to delete... now, "restore" it into the portable version of electrum.  That way, you know you have your private seed (12 words) correct and can restore it if you need to.
I am not telling you to go ahead and delete it because I can't see your screen or your system.  It's far better for you to be certain you can restore what ever your wallet is so that you can delete it without losing anything.

When you pick "Sell", then you pick the destination for the funds. If it is your USD wallet on their service, you'll have to move it from there to use it.  If you pick your connected bank, it will go to your bank account (about 5 business days -- that usually works out to 7 calendar days due to weekends).  
If you get a Shift debit card ($10) then you can pay directly from a BTC account up to $1000/day or get cash from an ATM up to $200/day and don't have to use the Sell feature.

Um Revenue was was not a requirement (e.g. Yahoo).
You can only use the term "products" in the loosest sense for many of those companies.  I'd reviewed a lot of them and that era is where the term "vaporware" came from.  Vaporware was what many of those companies sold to VC funders.  Vaporware continues to be sold to this day.  I've recently seen a $2 million dollar funding round to a company that intends to create a product that would defy the laws of physics (so, the service really is not possible under any circumstances because PHISICS won't work the way they imagine).

There is an underlying technology adoption curve going on that is different from "stocks".  Japan has 15 exchanges approved and 4 more under review for approval. Those exchanges are running ads on their TV and radio.  19 exchanges in a country with 120million people and the third largest economy on the globe.  The Asian markets as a whole are driving 60% of the markets right now.  That's a lot of on ramps into bitcoin and with 256k+ retailers accepting, a lot of off ramps.
Compare that to the US with a larger economy, twice the population, but only around 5 exchanges and accounting for 25% of the market right now.
This last week has seen bitcoin continuously in the news about the price rise.  Every one of those articles were like an ad screaming "hey look, people are making money over there!"  And, that's causes a lot of people in the US to wade through what ever they needed to to find the on-ramps to BTC.  With luck, more retailers will add more off ramps.  But, in the end... it means those people have found their way into bitcoin, and even if they sell, they've still gotten over the biggest hurdle making it easier to buy again in the future.
Those are all technology adoption (network) effects that are going to push the system to limits for a while.

Bail ins are the governments way of avoiding bail outs.  So, if an institution fails and you have money in it, they get to give you a share of stock in their bank instead of your money.  Then, hopefully, one day it the more distant future, you'll be able to sell that share back to them and get your money out.

The miner fee is the same without regard for the cash value of what's being transferred. So, sending 300BTC or .00003 BTC is going to cost you the same amount.  The fee is set hight to make it a higher priority in the mempools to be picked up by miners sooner rather than later.

Your friend is mis-informed.  Bitcoin couldn't even hope to match the electricity used by the US steel industry, let alone the entire country.  A single steel mill uses so much power, that when one is shut down, typically a near by electric generation plant is also shut down since the power company loses their demand, so it's no longer cost effective to keep the generation plant open.

How many of those trades were MtGox making with themselves?  They artificially generated their volume to entice others and to "drive up" prices.  MtGox was a shit hole run by a shit head in a country with no regulations.  There's a reason Paycoin (Garzia's scam coin) wanted to set up in Japan at that time!).
You seriously think holding $50k on a wallet on the same phone you take out drinking with you every weekend is safer than on a US regulated exchange (that exchanges USD, not these alt coin collector sites!).  Seriously?  You don't think people are going to whip out that phone to show off their bitcoin and end up with the phone either stolen or their ass beaten over it if they don't manage to drop it in a hole somewhere?
I'm fine if people want to be all black helocopters and chem trails about life... but the FUD over properly managed exchanges needs to stop.  Yes, there are bad exchanges.  Anything with USDT/Tether on it is a shit hole.  Anything w/no USD exchange is a shit hole.  Online wallet services that use real exchanges as a backend are shit holes (looking at blockchain.info).  This bullshit of painting every exchange with "But MtGox!" is going to cause a lot of novices to end up making their own investments inaccessible if not stolen if not worse. I just watched a case where a man was beaten to death over $30.  Do you think having $50k on your phone is going to be safe?  Not everyone has a computer these days.  Many are using their phones.

He had over $2.4 million in sales.  In the US, cash transfers of $10k or more must be reported as part of anti-money laundering laws.  Those who do routine cash exchanges have to register as money transmitters... again, part of making sure that terrorists aren't getting funding and stuff.  
It doesn't matter if he did it from his personal account or from a business.  It's the amounts that he's dealing in that trigger the requirements for Federal and state registration.  So far, he's only been prosecuted by the Federal government.
And, it isn't a problem because it was bitcoin, it's a problem because of the USD.  Had he been trading ETH for BTC, none of the regulations would have been applicable.

Saxo predicted a run up to $2100 in 2017.  They were off by a factor of six.  They predict a run up to $60k in 2018 before this crash.  If they're off by the same factor, that put is in the $360k/bitcoin range.  I'll take that.
China and Russia are certainly free to ban it.  There are plenty of other countries in the world perfectly happy to use bitcoin.

Japan is driving a lot of current demand.  They have a population (total, including infants!) of 120+ million people.  A Nov survey found 85% of people had heard of bitcoin, but less than 5% had purchased any.  This was after bitcoin was recognized as a currency earlier this year and bitcoin has been advertised on their television and other places.  Over 250k stores are able to accept bitcoin.  They have 15 exchanges formally approved with 4 more seeking approval.  I personally think that bitcoin is in an expansion/adoption phase and has quite a while to go.  Adoption is going in fits based on news reporting, but in the long run, I think more people will adopt it as they see their friends buy and use it without falling off the face of the earth or suddenly going homeless in the streets.

if you credit card still said "pending" it's possible they put a hold on it and then declined to transaction.  The holds self clear in 7 days or less.  This is common.  For example, when you pump gas w/a debit card, they put a hold on roughly $75, you pump, you pay and the transaction is closed out for the actual amount.  But, when the transaction doesn't complete and the seller doesn't send the cancellation through (because they're shit, so I'd avoid them), then the hold self expires after a set period.  Usually 7 days.
I would still file trouble ticket with Changly and move forward as if they'd taken the money.  But, if it says pending, it's likely that changly's IT department just sucks and can't write code for even basic transactions.

Their copy of your second signature key is encrypted with your password.  Without that password, they only have their signature key.  They need the password to decrypt the second signature key that is stored on their system.  Without the password, they can't decrypt the signature key. 
You should have two keys on your personal system if you downloaded the encrypted second key.  If you have one of the keys decrypted... perhaps they can let you upload that signature key for them to use to enable you to move the bitcoin stored at that address.

Easiest method of storage is paper wallet with both the public address and private key.  I've looked at videos of people using those HW wallets and they don't look any where near ready for prime time to me.
Easiest wallet is Electrum Portable version.  Can be stored/run on a USB and doesn't interact with the primary operating system at all.  You would only need bitcoin core if you wanted to run a full node for some reason.
I've been doing computer security for twice as long as you've been building PCs.  I do it for a living.  We're about at the 1996 level cell phone stage of technology adoption.  Lightning Network has just achieved a version 1.0 release.  The technology will improve and the on ramps and off ramps will get smoother over time.  In 1996, you had to go to a radio shack and pledge a testicle to get someone to explain how to use those "car phones" (that actually were installed in your car w/a corded hand set)... now, there are probably more cell phone stores than McDonalds in the US.  For any shopping strip with a McDonalds, you can probably find three different cell phone stores as well.
The best way to avoid losing your BTC (and everyone is going to down vote this to hell) is to keep it with a credible exchange.  In the US, Coinbase is probably the best exchange.  They've invested millions into security and are moving into providing fiduciary storage for hedge funds.  They do not tolerate people who are not willing to fully identify themselves for tax purposes and activity w/shady sites like gambling sites will get you bounced out fast.
And, for people who say "but my anonymity!"  -- The block chain is public.  There are services who identify known addresses (e.g. gambling sites, coinbase, different exchanges).  Companies like Coinbase use those services to identify when you've sent money to something that puts their business at risk.  Several branches of law enforcement have blockchain tools that automate connecting the dots.  You would have to work VERY HARD to be anonymous on the blockchain.  What bitcoin provides is autonomy.  Pull all your bitcoin to your own wallet and have at it.  Be your own banker.  But, then you also need to be your own security guard and IT continuity planner too.

Yes... they can be manipulated, but the technique he described assumes I can list an asset for $100 above market rate and it will sell above market rate.  There's a difference between the normal fluctuations and me being able to go onto GDAX and execute some agreement to sell to you at above market rates.  
Right now, on GDAX alone... it would take a market buy of 1600 bitcoins to push the price to $12000.  If I could do that once, cool!  How am I going to sustain that buy volume?  And, that's on a single exchange... there are 11+ exchanges in Japan, at least 4 or 5 that I can think of in the US.  To push the price up, you need to push it on a global scale.

Asian markets are 60% of the driving force recently.

Japan is the 3rd largest economy w/a population of 127 million people.  No matter what, they are and will likely continue to slam bitcoin hard.  These institutional investors will create very few transactions in comparison. It takes the same processing power to handle a $30 transaction as a $3 million dollar transaction.

Japan has the third largest economy, 11 exchanges so far (they're still approving more) and a total population of 123 million.  Asian markets are driving 60% of the current markets that were $1 trillion yesterday. Asian markets want to get out from under the PetroDollar (USD based oil buying).  Okinawa Japan has had it up to the gills with the US Bases there because of the crime and pollution associated with them.  
For a US company to attempt to manipulate the markets (if they could have effect) would be as a minimum an international scandal but could also galvanize a population to oust a key US foothold in the region and make the future of the pertrodollar that much dimmer.

I have no problem with their fees given that they're professionally run and Federally regulated.  
To use Shift off of a Coinbase account, you'll have to buy or put BTC into a Coinbase account.  Using ACH transfer from a bank, the fees are 1.49%  I'm not sure the Stripe fees because  Shift uses Coinbase as the backend, so it may be internal transfers to them (Internal off chain transfers are free).  I've never noticed a conversion fee tacked onto my Shift purchases, but I also haven't specifically looked for them.  If I buy $60.15 at a store, I get noticed that my account had $60.15 BTC "sent to Shift"
I paid $10 for the card.
EDIT!  This originally made reference to "Stripe" card... it is a SHIFT card.

Okay.  See if you can get Electrum loaded on either of them.  Once you load it on one, we'll "recover" your wallet to the other.  Electrum can be found at their website

i'm sure I'm paying a percentage over the spot price of bitcoin since the bitcoin is sold at the point of purchase.  It's never been so noticeable that I went back and checked it out exactly how much it is.  From the vendor's perspective it works exactly like a any other debit card. Then I get notices of the spend and they're listed in my Coinbase wallet (value at time of point of sale).

I'm paying my tax accountant in BTC.  I also give my clients a 10% discount if they pay in BTC.  
I've done transcription and it does not pay anywhere near 1.5 BTC.  I've never seen any survey pay in the range of the value of 2 BTC.  I would never click on links making such offers.  They sound like the sort of links that would end up trying to infect your computer.
I would never go to a faucet site.  At best, even with a system, you'll make less than $1/hr and it's far more likely you'll end up with a computer virus or key logger that will be used to steal your wallet information.
Even $6/mo will add up over time, so no problems with only putting in small amounts.  If you make a habit of it, it builds up.  I gave $10 to a friend Dec of last year, it's now worth over $190.  (It was 0.0119 BTC, so you can check the value if you like.  It was right at $10 when given).

1 BTC will always be 1 BTC... just like .05 BTC will always be .05 BTC.  The amount you own does not change over time unless you buy or sell it.
The value of 1 BTC is constantly decided by the market place.  Last year, people would pay $1000 for it... now, people will pay $10,000 for it.  If next year, people will only pay $10 for it, that will be the value.
You have no cash (e.g. USD) unless you sell some of your BTC to get it.  Just like at one point you had no BTC and sold your cash to get some.
You confusing the value of the BTC you have with the amount of BTC you have.  If I buy a Ford truck, I can say "I have a $50k truck" or  "I have an 2018 F250".  In three years, I can say "I have a $20k truck" (it's older now) or I can say "I have an F250".  The amount of "F250" didn't change, but the value of it did.  If I want the cash from that truck, then I need to sell if for USD.  At that point, I'll have cash, but no truck.

Coinbase Vault:  Multi-million dollar company w/fully paid technical team whose job it is to make sure it stays put. You have to know the information required to pull it back out, including access to two different email addresses. 
Electrum Portable on USB stick:  Doesn't leave foot print on PC, lets you spin up wallet (that should have seed stored elsewhere), can be used on any system.  BAD: USB sticks die without warning.
Paper:  Simple.  Include both seed for wallet (along with what type of wallet it was) and can include both QR codes and character strings for public and private keys.  Paper can degrade.  Printer ink on acidic paper can fade (look for inks and paper designed for photographs instead of the cheap stuff).

Look at technology adoption curves.  Currently there are 15 exchanges in Japan, multiple exchanges in other countries, (I think) 5 exchanges in the US.  These are all providing on-ramps to people interested in buying bitcoin.
This last week has been wall to wall bitcoin in the US mainstream media.  Even though people have been saying "it's gone from $1k to $15k in less than a year, stay away!" a certain percentage hear "$1k to $15k" and also see others saying it could go to $50k or $60k next year and are motivated to find an on ramp.
Those new investors are outstripping the creation of new bitcoin + sellers willing to part with their bitcoin, so the price rises as a result of the limited supply.

I think we need Segwit adoption and the Lightning Network to be proven to work.  If those things happen, I think adoption will be easier for people to use as a spending account. 
But, right now, that 15 exchanges are operating and 4 more seeking licenses in Japan says that some businesses have decided that there is (or will be) enough demand to justify their investment.
Consider that the US (population 300+ million) only has maybe 4 or 5 credible exchanges supporting it?  Once Lightning Network gets established and we see how well it does or does not work, I could see a stronger adoption curve.

Reusing the same change address links all of the addresses that you've sent from into the same wallet.  If any address in that wallet can be linked to you (say you bought a product that was shipped to you at your address) then all of the linked addresses are also linked to you.
If you're not doing anything illegal and don't care if authorities can link addresses to you, then there's no problem.  If you're planning on evading taxes, funding terrorists, or trafficking drugs... that's when the problem with reused change addresses come in.

Yes, that is wrong.  For assets held over 1yr, the gains are added behind your income.  So, if you earned 20k in income, then you pay income tax on that.  If you earned 30k in LONG term capital gains, you pay 0% on 20,001-37,950.  You pay 15% on 37,951 - (some number that I forget, but in the 400k range?) ... then you pay a higher capital gains on the amount above that number I can't remember.

That 18k was definitely a market spike above how bitcoin has been performing since the beginning of the year. 
Uncertainty over the CBOE exchange starting tomorrow is likely causing a lot of people to step aside for at least a day or two.  Alt-coins that moved into BTC because of the news pump last week may be going back to their alt coins.  Bitcoin has been comfortably sliding around the 15k range (14k-16k) for a couple days now, it will have to gain more support to move upwards again.  Once the CBOE event is in the rear view mirror... the CME futures will be less scary because they'll have seen the effect of at least one futures exchange.
I personally prefer the current ease that it's waving around the 15k level because that means the new (nervous) buyers are getting shaken out of the system and the old holders have taken their profits so it's rebalancing back to basic expansion mode.

The CME is using a price that is across multiple exchanges (they have criteria for the exchanges to include) and has a moving average component (I think it was 20 day moving average?) and has a panic cut out of maybe 20% move?

Good advice?  That people spend through the nose to transfer bitcoin from a well designed service (not the two they provided) to devices or applications that they barely understand and can manage to absolutely permanently lose their investment through simple oversight or misunderstandings?  Or.. how about buy bitcoin, spend $20 to transfer it out only to spend $20 to transfer it back a few days (maybe weeks) later to cash out?
There are a lot of new people getting involved in this.  They are not all the most technically savvy folks.  This "if you leave your bitcoin on an exchange you'll lose it" FUD is stupid unless you're willing to show me the dollar bills you have piled up in your garage instead of storing them in a bank.  Not only is it costly and potentially dangerous to people who still have a lot more to learn before they may eventually transfer their stuff... it's putting extra load on the network and on all the support systems who have to keep explaining that $2 is not enough for a transaction and now you have to wait for the network to reject it.

What are you talking about?  That article made no sense.  People are going to sell off recenlty purchased bitcoin to have it taxed as short term capital gains?  WTF?  
At $36k income (everything, your work + your short term capital gains) you are at 25% tax rate.  At $89k, 28% tax rate, At $186k, 33% tax rate, at $405k 35% tax rate.  
Compare that to long term capital gains that is 0% up to $37k, then 15% up to $400k, then 20% over that.
FIFO is not new and he didn't provide a source for his 'per account' claim.  And, if it is "per account" then why doesn't the move to a new address resets that "account" base date and base price (triggering a capital gain event)?  
The like-kind exchanges also has always had restrictions that would make them hard to pull off in an arms length exchange so probably were not used often, if at all.

There are betting sites that bet on future events (this sort of looks like that with the one line statements).  Those sites promote that they have value based on input from large numbers of people willing to put money on their predictions.  There is validity to the fact that when you get large numbers of people to guess about something, they will tend toward the correct answer.  
Your site doesn't have the gambling draw.  So, not sure how you will attract users.  Perhaps if you develop a system to track what users guess correctly over time, so some users can be weighted higher than others.  BUT, you need to first attract a large number of participants for that to be a value. 
Visually, you're using a lot of real estate.  Might consider putting the up/down votes and percentage on a single line (w/percentage in the center).  Also, might add an ability to link a source for people to read what generated the idea for adding the topic into the voting system.

I have invested in the future of our planet and a hope to free people from oppressive corporations (specifically banks) who get all the rules made in their favor.  10 years is nothing compared to the idea that in the future, people can conduct business w/out the blessings of financial monopolies.


And, there is the rub.  I am investing in the hope that no one will be able to ban bitcoin any more than they could ban the Internet.  There are already programs to enable bitcoin transactions over satellite and other 'out of band' communications mechanisms. Bitcoin is critical to our ability to maintain our freedom of expression (citation: wikileaks).  Bitcoin enables the "everyman" to have a form of "off shore account" like the rich have enjoyed for decades (centuries?).  Why do they get to secret their money to untraced account, while we are expected to play by the rules that don't apply to them?

Our current monetary system (The Bretton Woods System) was set up in 1944.  They were 13yo and 20yo at the time.  That system pegged the US Dollar to gold.
We left the gold backed dollar in 1971.  They were 40yo and 47yo at the time. That put us onto the current fiat system that has allowed the continual erosion of the value of a dollar.
Now we have the Bitcoin Network and cryptocurrencies.  
They have both lived in three different eras of financial systems when most have only ever known the current fiat USD based system. People are only beginning to even know that bitcoin exists.

The rest is what I originally typed because I failed to read my original post.... leaving it for the heck of it.
When the global economy went tits up, people quit buying shit because they were scrambling while watching their investments to go to shit.  Since they quit buying shit, nothing had to be shipped (e.g. stuff wasn't shipped between countries, stuff wasn't shipped to store shelves, stuff sat in warehouses)... global demand for crude oil plummeted and left huge caches of oil that should have sold in the futures markets stranded as people were forced to try to take delivery and store it until the price went back up enough that they didn't lose their shirts.  They literally got to a point of filling tanker ships to sit them on the ocean to wait until the cargo could be sold and literally unloaded again.  Since many futures were no longer a good hedge, money moved into gold as a storage medium.

You can buy as little as you like, it isn't like stocks that require you to buy a whole share.  Bitcoin can still (technically) be purchased for less than a dollar. The $10 I gave as Christmas presents in Dec 2016 are now worth over $100.  The bitcoin I bought in Jan are now worth less than what I paid for it.  
But, over the long run, it will have to rise to accommodate growing adoption.  Korea is on a program to go cashless by 2020 and cryptocurrencies (including bitcoin) are part of that.  Japan has moved forward with bitcoin in their everyday economy and will be hosting the Olympics in 2020.  Imagine travelers cheques replaced by bitcoin? The Asian markets are looking for a replacement of the USD based petrodollar and a bitcoin based crude oil market was opened for trading last fall.
TCP/IP at one point was a greater fool type thing, but it was a simple technology easily implemented and beat out the competition.  Bitcoin's strength will be if they keep with the KISS theory and focus on providing the foundation for second tier services like the Lightning Network transactions.

We've only talked about 1 analogy and it isn't a good one in my opinion.  The difference between BTC and BitcoinCash is not "microscopic" unless you have no experience in cryptocurrencies.  That is why experienced people need to keep talking about the difference between them.  Unless you think the difference between that car (Porsche) and lawnmower (Honda) are microscopic as well and would be perfectly happy to have a lawnmower instead of a Porsche if it saved you a few bucks.  The lawnmower is never going to be able to be licensed to operate on highways or road systems... but the difference is just miniscule, so you'll be perfectly happy with that lawnmower.  Right?

I personally do not use bitcoin at the pump or when I'm out and about town.  So, I have a cold wallet printed and use that to accumulate bitcoin to for long term storage.  I have a coinbase account and that is where my "active" bitcoin sits (e.g. If I want it available for use through my debit card or to trade with it).  I also do not have any bitcoin related stuff on my phone.  I buy/sell from my home computer and have a QR Code for a wallet address stored as a PNG file on my phone so that if I need to receive bitcoin to an address, I can display the QR Code for the address.
Once we reach a point where you can buy directly with bitcoin, I might reconsider, but until then... I only rarely receive bitcoin when I'm away from my desk and I never buy with it except from my desk.  So, I don't really need to carry anything around with me.

you're not 'investing' in bitcoin, you're buying bitcoin.  
When you buy it, someone has sold it for that price and that someone is pocketing your fiat in exchange for the bitcoin.  When you go to sell it, you offer it at a price (or at market) and someone says.. "yes, I'll take that deal" and hands you fiat in exchange for your bitcoin.
The money is coming from and going to the person on the other side of the transaction. If you buy a car for $30k, then sell it later for $20k the $10k difference doesn't go anywhere.. the value of the car simply is lower when you were selling.  If the car were suddenly in really high demand for some reason and you could sell it for $40k because everyone wants it... the extra $10k profit is coming from the buyer.

The biggest issue is that it's going to take a few states setting up to test the waters to see how large of an exchange would be needed to backend something at the Federal level.

Coinbase has done a massive upgrade and it was publicly announced once completed. 
Large institutional buys would not be announced as that would work against them.  As it is, they have to buy slowly in order to not jack the price through the roof.  Why make any announcement that would also only serve to run the prices up?

It's possible that some services go offline for updates so queue query data and then come back online at 4am and are picking up queued queries from the prior 30min in a "blip" that's being counted when the queue is processed.

In the US, banks are required to have a "cash reserve" and they can lend money based on it.  You put $100 in your account, they can lend out $900 for interest (that's called fractional banking) and get 10% interest on all of it as it's paid back.  They're not paying for the discount, they're simply shaving a small percentage off their profit from holding your money.

NO.  You cannot mine blocks again.  You can only tamper with the **current** block being found.  Once a block is accepted as valid in the block chain, that's it.  So, you can only tamper with a future block (the one that is being sought right now or going forward).

No scam.  Just not for the general public.  They've basically created transactions that are electronically signed and enable the digital processing because they cannot be altered after the fact (like can happen in traditional databases) and can be made publicly auditable by people with access.

right, any block already in the blockchain is mathematically imbedded into the blockchain... you can only alter new blocks, then run a race condition to make that part of the chain the longest.  So, in the example, blocks 1, 2, and 3 cannot be changed.
When you send a transaction, 1st confirmation = is included in current block being sought.  2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th confirmations are subsequent blocks that have been found/included... so, by 6th block (6th confirmation) it is too late for a 51% attacker to outrace the global blockchain and make an alternate version of the chain that will be accepted.

NIST typically waits for there to be multiple candidates (ideally like 10 or more), then submits them to testing and evaluation before they bless any of them.  Until NIST blesses a solution, bitcoin can do nothing in any practical way.  Using any solution that is not part of the mainstream leaves them open to vulnerabilities that would be discovered in more heavily used protocols.
Once anything is blessed, there will be a period of years to migrate. Plenty of time for a notification process and for bitcoin holders to move to upgraded wallet software.

Without information about the absorbency of the Bolivar, I cannot even begin to estimate if 3.7 million would last 2 years or longer. But, that would be over 5k bolivar/day.

The gold price spike in 2011/2012 was at a time when there was a global slow down so bad that oil prices dropped (as in, people were not even shipping stuff level slow down)... so gold would have been a store of value at that point.  There is no similar underlying reason for the bitcoin spike in 2016/2017 even gold was not spiking in that period.  The 2016/2017 movement was result of adoption/publicity combined with decrease in production.  We're now in a healthy accumulation phase w/slower (healthier) adoption curve.

Um... the driver would be adoption.  As in, Japan, South Korea, other markets all spinning up on a single global currency.  Japan is 40% of the market and they have the 2020 Olympics coming up.  S.Korea is 5% of the market and they're working on being entirely digital currencies by 2020 with bitcoin among their plans. The concerning thing is USDT (tether) is 23% of the market (would be nice to see that gotten rid of entirely)... but USDT is not entirely US based.  And, the US is less than 25% of the market.
And, secondly... bitcoin is not a company, so there are no projections, etc... that would require market manipulation. The closest to projections you can get are mining operations and that's been set out clearly (the number of bitcoins mined) for 9 years now.

You want a tampered block into the block chain.  You mine it and submit it.  You now have to out race all the rest of the global system to pound added blocks behind that one so that the chain containing the tampered block is the longest (most work) chain being accepted.  That means, in theory, if you have 51% of mining power and have them all accept the tampered block as valid, your blockchain will become the accepted chain.
You cannot go back and change something from a week ago or months ago, you have to change it at the current time, then force the blockchain to accept it as valid.

Meet in VERY VERY public places.  Some people do craigslist transactions in the parking lot of their local police.  This is a good idea.  Remember that the person is going to know that you're carrying cash.
In the US, do not carry large sums of cash unless you're familiar with Civil Forfeiture laws... basically, the police can say "Hmmm, you look like you're gonna buy some drugs with that money" and take it.  They don't have to arrest you or even charge you with anything.  They can just take it and then you have to get an attorney to prove that you didn't just sell drugs and didn't intend to buy drugs with it.  It's a BULL SHIT law, but it is used frequently by some police jurisdictions.  (  )  
Cash transactions over $10k are supposed to be reported.  Including repeated transactions that total up to $10k.  That's part of anti-money laundering laws. So, don't go crazy in the amounts you buy/sell through localbitcoin.

I've been in tech since before the dot com bubble.  This guy is an idiot who is simply spouting "wives tales".  I had to review tech for my clients in that time frame... many companies were headed by barely functional programmers who'd managed to get shit to work in html and had the gift of gab (they could sell ice in Alaska).  Their products were shit, their investors were wowed with anything that could work on the World Wide Web.  These companies has shit financials and were destined to fall as soon as the investors got sick of paying for their pet projects.  
Add to the "idiots with more money than sense" mix the fact that suddenly the average joe could get an ETrade account and be his own stock broker who were seeing all the news about how the tech companies were gonna be yhuge!  So, buying pressure was expanded until the first dip turned them all on their tails trying to "not lose everything" around Spring 2001.
Not long after that we had a little 9/11 problem that sunk EVERYTHING everywhere... including all those idiot companies that might have gotten their shit straight suddenly were in one of the worst economies you could imagine.  Suddenly no one wanted to throw cash at crazy schemes that might end up working... everyone pulled back to see if we were going to end up in World War III.
Second - The Tulip Bubble is highly disputed.  Read the Wikipedia page.  Scientific research found maybe six individuals who were financially ruined in that time frame and none could be linked to tulip bulb investment.  Some claim that it was just a market fluctuation that went a bit higher than normal.  Tulip bulbs have recently sold for over $100k (more than the price of a house)... so flowers can be expensive.

The problem is that people talk about sending bitcoin for free or nearly free and the transaction fees are treated like donations.  Well... if you don't want to donate to pay for the network that's handling the transaction, it makes sense that your transaction doesn't get picked up by the network.
This is a pure marketing problem in the way people talk about transaction fees.  The network is working as intended. And, yes... the people who want to send their btc for nothing (or next to nothing) will get what they paid for.  That isn't lame, that's life.

If you listen to the interview video... he also said silver is going to become so valuable that there will be people going house to house looking to buy anything plated in silver and even old photographs that are made with a silver based solution.  I believe he had silver around the $1000 mark.
The justification for the extreme rise in silver was new technologies that will demand a lot of silver. I think the gold rise was a result of exhaustion of market manipulation combined with turmoil making people move to value stores viewed safer than national currencies.
Do I think he's right?  He's interesting to watch and listen to. But, I also like watching those old ladies that predict the future on talk shows (I think Jean Dixon was one of them).  It gives you a sense of "insider knowledge" combined with hope that you're in the right investments.  But, I think if he ever came close, it would be a fluke and not the results of his bot that he has never allowed anyone to review.

The use of fractal geometry to predict stock market moves was new back at that time and found to be more accurate than other methods. Fractal geometry is especially good for identifying a peak in a bull run, expected low points in bear markets, and a useful tool for plotting a likely future trajectory based on data history.  So, this isn't entirely out in left field. BUT, it would be better to have a more recent version of this calculated than to depend on one that was created back in 2014.

There is also a major, government sponsored project in South Korea to integrate bitcoin into their national payment system. That kicked off this year.

There is some reporting specific to cash purchases over $10k.  I'm not sure if it's anti-laundering laws or IRS laws that require it. But, there is a form to fill out and submit to the government and you get the form from the IRS website if I remember correctly.

I'm missing something?  Possession of something of value isn't taxable.  I could have bought a BTC at $400, it runs up to a present day value of $750... but then crashes to $200... until I sell the bitcoin, there is no taxable element.  Possession is not taxable. If I sell at the $750, then I have capital gains.  If I sell at $200 then I have a capital loss.  If I hold the BTC until the year 2020, then there is no taxable action in the years in between.
Now, if I'm paid in bitcoin, then that's as taxable as standard bartering.  Your income is the fair market value at the time of receipt.  So, if I work for a farmer and get 10 round bales valued at $50 each, I have earned $500.  If I make a video for someone for 10 BTC, then I've earned what ever the value is at the time of payment.  The IRS doesn't demand to see my round bales, all I have to do is declare them.  What right does the government have to demand to see my BTC if I declare them?

In the US, it doesn't take 10 years that I know of... but the solution to the too big to fail crap was something called "bail ins" to replace bail outs.  With the new bail ins, you can have a percentage of your account balance replaced with something akin to stock options in the bank that has busted it's cash reserve.  Now, if it takes 10yrs or not to get the right to exchange the options for cash and for the options to be valued at the original cash value that you lost... who knows.  I think Greece is the only place bail ins have been tried so far and they didn't seem happy about them.

For US people.  Read their website closely.  They're providing pre-paid cards without identifying information and provide them to citizens of countries that are on US blocked lists (e.g. for support of terrorism, etc).  I'm not saying that this business (registered in Scotland) does this in any way.  I'm pointing this out because attempting to make transfers from a US bank to this organization could cause your US account to become locked and investigated.  Some US banks are complete jackasses and this issuer is clearly providing cards that barely (perhaps do not) meet US regulatory requirements. As an example.  Each US State has regulatory requirements for the sort of card they are claiming to provide.  There is no mention of what states' residents these cards can be issued to.
If you are going to make transactions to this business, I would suggest that you do not use any stateside bank account that you cannot afford to have temporarily suspended (or even terminated) without notice.

Well, over 500k unique addresses were involved in just one day's trading on each of several days this last week.  Hard to think that all those addresses were doing nothing but churning coins through the system for giggles.  If the average / day unique addresses are running at 500k, then that's at least 1500k unique addresses (giving up 1000k addresses as having been re-used over several days)... that seems to point to more than 500k total addresses in use.  I looked again and still can't find anything on blockchain.info that says there are only 500k addresses in use.  I was just asking where you got that number from.

Overstock's BTC processing is done by Coinbase, so coinbase handles the transaction (like how paypal would handle it for that service) and gives a "paid" back to the retailer. So, coinbase works it out behind the scenes... like when you use a debit card, there is a $0.03 fee + % fee that's worked out behind the scenes and part of the retailer's service fee.

I buy through coinbase using EFT from my bank.  It takes 5 business days to post to my account.  The amount of BTC posted to my account is the amount shown when I created the transaction.  So, if I buy 1 BTC @ $800 on Wed through the coinbase interface, it will post 1 BTC to my account roughly the following Wed and my bank will be debited the $800.  This is true even if the price of BTC on the following Wed is $600 or $1000.  
After the fact, looking back at transactions in my account.  The purchases and sales continue to reflect the price at the time of the transaction and are not updated to the current prices. So, to this day, I can still see how I sold 3 BTC for $600 at the time.  This information is needed to complete your tax records.

Not the deliveries side, but there is an intermediary service that lets you buy from Amazon w/bitcoin.

(a) Coinbase can roll out the BCH accounts on an incremental basis to avoid price spikes.
(b) the 300k accounts over Thanksgiving may well be funded if they were at Coinbase and not GDAX.  Coinbase sells BTC at a set price, then waits for the ACH transfer to complete before making the bitcoin available to you, but at the point of purchasing the BTC, the bitcoin has been sold and Coinbase will replenish their retail stock from GDAX.

Nov 1 it was around the $6k mark.  Oct 1st it was around the $4k mark.  I've bought since both those time frames and if it drops I'm not worried at all.  Losing two months worth of gains in a long run view isn't really anything beyond entertainment.  Some watch horror movies, I watch BTC charts.  :-)  
Prob the first year is the hardest with BTC because everything is so "intense" small corrections feel like the world is going to end.  After a year of it, you'll get more detached and have more BTC in the black so it won't freak you out as much.  That's part of why you see so many people seeing dips as "buying opportunities".

Wait a year, then consider it.  Selling to meet pressing and unavoidable real life needs is VERY REASONABLE. Sell because of a dip is an emotional move that probably won't end well.  I had a friend double their investment earlier this year and they cashed out.  All year I've been posting prices to them and a month ago finally asked how much they had kept.  Zero.  They'd cashed out once they'd doubled their money because the prices slid down a bit and made them nervous.  That was probably around $2k.  Now, they've bought back in at over $7k last month.  I just keep thinking... wow, if they would have only held, their initial investment would have been 10x.  Instead, they're starting back at that slow cog of a start again... now the price is sliding and friend realizes... that's bitcoin, you just roll with it.

Coinbase is regulated. Each human can only sign up for one account.  They provide services inside of the account to keep different sub-accounts (e.g. gambling money vs long term storage)... but in the US humans are identified by SSNs.  Each SSN is only going to get one account.  The alternate (that they prob do support) are companies that would each have to have a Federally assigned EIN.

Your comparing a global asset against a national currency. By your logic, if BTC goes to $100 each, then I should be able to buy an average car for roughly $600 because the US Dollar has gotten that much stronger.

It's not "manipulation" so much as human nature.  You're talking probably hundreds of thousands of people making individual decisions.  Many are piling into BTC as a get rich quick scheme, so when it rises by $400 over night...that's a good increase and more mature traders will take the profit and be happy with it.

I've been thinking about this... BTC doubled in price for two years running (2015/2016) and people were amazed that anything could do that and it was a bubble... now, since this time last year, BTC is 10x the price.  This year, we've seen a lot of new demand and a lot of formalization of country level regulations/support.  We've seen forks that put huge uncertainty into the market.  And of course, China has been in, then out, then in, then??? (not sure where they are right now).  Japan, S.Korea, Australia, India are all becoming bigger players.  
It would be very interesting if the price could 10x by this time next year.  It seems impossible, but on the other hand... it's a limited supply asset and the number of individuals involved is growing very rapidly.

All companies have to do systems maintenance, sometimes that requires disabling services for upgrades.  I have no prob with that, especially considering that they're trying to upscale for an unprecedented surge in user accounts.
The "locked out" accounts seem to be 2FA slip ups (lost phone, etc) or people unwilling to comply with regulatory requirements for ID.   Coinbase does screw up sometimes and their customer service does suck.  But, I'm still more comfortable with a company of their size and backing.
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:14:28
Just remember to count any BTC as "gone money" so that you don't panic sell if it drops in price.  Lots of people panic sold way back and are regretting it now.  Only sell BTC if you need it to keep yourself afloat IRL or you've reached your goals.

if you're in the US, Coinbase has the ability to have a Shift card attached to your account and bitcoin is only sold at the point of sale.  Not the same as paying in bitcoin, but certainly enables you to be 100% bitcoin until you absolutely need to go to fiat.
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:48:29
If you're buying BTC through regulated sources... they already have automated tracking tools.  The addresses used by major organizations are already known.  So, lying to the government about your income or gains can (and likely will) be found by automated systems that can parse data much faster than any forensic accountant.
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:08:08
my guess about what will happen... 
You currently have different "accounts/wallets" on Coinbase... you have BTC, USD, ETH, and I think an LTC "account/wallet".  If the fork happens, you'll see a new "account/wallet" show up for the denomination of B2X and it should contain the same number of B2X as your total BTC "accounts/wallets" 
When I started with Coinbase, it was just BTC or USD... but as they added new coins, they just put new wallets for the new coin in my account with a zero balance.  That's why I'm just expecting another wallet to show up for the B2X coin.
* the scare quotes are because technically you have only 1 account and the assets are held in different ways, like the USD is just USD... the others are denomination based wallets.

EMP is a sudden large blast of energy.  Longer items act like antenna (think cross country power lines), absorb the power and transfer it to connected devices (think how you should unplug sensitive electronics in a lightening storm).  Cross country power lines blow out connected transformers due to the massive scale of the "antenna".   When you get down to automobile sizes... far fewer conductive surfaces are exposed, so any EMP energy would need to traverse an (often) rubberized outer shell to reach the conductive wires.  I don't think you need a Faraday cage (and a poorly constructed one could turn out to be a bake oven)... just get a nice rugedized (rubber type) case for it.

I'm guessing they'll establish their own b2x nodes to ensure that ServerB2X is pointed only at a node on the B2X chain and then the BTC accounts will be on servers that use the BTC nodes like usual.
Also... when Joe, Sally, Rajah, etc, etc... each have accounts credited with a certain amount of BTC... all of that BTC could be held on a single address (or a limited number of addresses)...so, it isn't like they have to do it for a few million addresses... probably only a couple hundred, or a couple thousand addresses at most for the actual, physical blockchain addresses.

No idea of current number of users... but...
Japan has a population of 125 million and there are actually BTC commercials on their television programming.  If it sees 10% adoption rate, that's 12.5 million added users.  
S.Korea is a population of 50 million... a 1% adoption rate would be 0.5 million... 
So, that's 13 million potential users in two countries (admitted countries making very public, formal adoption policies).
BTC is an asset that's limited to 21 million BTC once ALL of them are mined.
 
Edited:  Meant 10% vs 1% adoption rate in Japan because of their shit yen situation.

I gave a friend $10 worth last December for them to understand what it is and setup a Coinbase account.  That was 0.0119 BTC at the time.  You can look up the value of that now.  So, while is sounds small ($10) it does have potential.  And, if you can blow $20 on eating out twice and not miss that... even if BTC goes in the dumper, will you really be out much more than excess calories?
Edit: for those who don't want to click around... at this writing, 0.0119 BTC = $118.56 USD

You should look at being a "Bitcoin Evangelist" and the "job" would be the wrap around services that the bitcoin community needs.  If you're in the US, that would be:
- Legislative actions (like how HI has made it impossible for crypto currency based service providers to operate there), the prevention of treating bitcoin as an automatic "you're a drug lord" thing (look at how cops confescate cash now, and they're getting the right to force you to provide passwords to phones, next will be phone apps and any BTC holdings will be considered "probably used in drug trafficing") 
- Promoting the study of the impact of bitcoin on specific populations.  BTC has the ability to enable the unbanked to participate in society.  (People who the banks have actively refused accounts to!). It also enables transactions that would be too costly/inefficient via traditional banking.  Other aspects of societal impact.  These studies are important in the reframing of Bitcoin from the silk road days and would be needed to counter legislators who will want laws that permit confiscation of BTC because it's "bad stuff" they used on silk road.
- BTC based charity or foundation to demonstrate the benefit of a deflationary currency.  Basically, you set up a seed, and each xx period draw off the growth to use for specific activities and if the seed falls below a set level, go on fund raising campaigns.  
So, there is plenty that you could do without being a programmer.  The BTC community has many needs and credible evangelicals working to provide tangible evidence of the benefits of BTC is one of them.  I worked for years as an Information Security Evangelist and, if BTC is something you believe in, then share it.  Eventually, you'll be able to earn money sharing your beliefs. if you need help, pm me.

I'm on coinbase... but, if you have your BTC in your own wallet, you're going to have to wait for a wallet that will import your keys into a B2X wallet and you need to make sure that wallet has replay protection.  So, you should look for people who've found such a wallet and follow their instructions.

The TL/DW: if it's worth $1million it means US currency has gone bust.
Totally ignores the expansion in user base that's going on.  As an example, Coinbase is adding as many as 1 million new users (people,not wallets) per month.  Even at 1/2 million / month, that's 6 million / year.  That's just one company.  How many exchanges are out there adding how many users that never open a Coinbase account?
At this point, there are fewer than 17 million BTC total.  Some of that is known to be locked up or lost.  Another portion is in the hands of people who are HODL.  So, the user base is expanding while the number of available coins are not expanding nearly as fast.
Can it hit $1 million? That would put it around 60% the size of all physical money available and around 1/4 the size of the stock market.  So, it would be a significant challenge to see that level of demand, but I hardly think it's impossible.
Some other examples to consider:
- At $25k / BTC it would roughly equal the value of Amazon (the company) 
- At $44k / BTC it would roughly equal the value of Apple 
- At $115k / BTC it would roughly equal the GDP of the state of California 
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:25:36
Even if you were already set up with an account with an appropriate weekly limit (most are $5k or even less if your account is still new)... the bank transfer time is 5 business days and they're stopping transactions 24hrs prior...so, you're looking at trying to get the funds into the account so bitcoin is credited BEFORE Nov 15th.  So, looks like coinbase is out for you.  Sorry.
(Coinbase has specifically said they are only doubling coins that have been credited to accounts... so, the purchases in progress will not get doubled and will be considered after the fork.)

This is not a "search and seizure" issue.  At best, it's a right to privacy issue.  Banks already report on cash transactions over $10k as part of anti-money laundering.  These transactions are double that amount.
@_date: 2017-11-01 19:29:10
So... this is clearly attempting to circumvent US Federal regulations and what ever regulations exist in the origin country.  In particular, money laundering regulations (as in, you need to account for any cash transactions over $10k, including series of transactions that exceed $10k).  If you're going to do this, you may as well ask them to ship you a big bale of cocaine and a crate of automatic weapons.
I'm guessing that if you respond, there will be an oopsie and they will either attempt to get your bank account number (that they'll be able to draw out of without notice) or your full identification (because they're too cheap to buy it from the Equifax data breach).

- Promise of BTC availability 7 days after purchase (7th by midnight)
- Actual availability 6 days after purchase (6th notified mid afternoon)
So, 5 days is good, but my average has been 6 calendar days w/out any holidays.  That makes tomorrow (Tues) the latest day that I can do a purchase and expect it to be available for the fork.

@_date: 2017-11-02 09:56:58
BTC on Coinbase at the point of the fork will be matched with B2X that will be available for sell/trade/moves approx 48hrs after the fork (this is to allow the networks to stabilize and establish themselves).  You do not have to do anything to gain access to your B2X.  If you had BTC on there prior to Aug, then you also have BCH that is supposed to be made available by the first of the year.
If you're worried about having private address, the Coinbase Multi-Signature Vault service creates 3 private addresses where you need 2 of 3 to create transactions.  You will get one address automatically.  The second will be encrypted and stored on Coinbase, but also available for you to download locally.  And the third will be held by Coinbase.  If you download the second address, then you can sign and create transactions without Coinbase involved.  If you loose everything on your local machine... Coinbase will still have their address + the second address to unlock the vault BTC for transactions.
I'm not going to suggest what you should do.  Keep your BTC where you are most comfortable.  I'm just telling you the services that Coinbase does offer and they've been reliable for me for several years now.  But, if you have a problem needing customer service, they are definitely not the most responsive company around.

PGP has 20 years on any cryptocurrency.  Enables crime.  They talked about banning it and got no where (with the exception of France?).

Yup... he's not gonna like bitcoin. Quick, someone send him some to his email from a Coinbase account. :-)




And... he can eat a bag of dicks! It's time we get past the "winners and losers" shit. I'm happy for everyone in any of the bitcoin markets to be able to do well w/out the intervention of "economists" who seem all too happy to flush the middle class and lower class people. Fuck. Him.
Also, irresponsible to call out the Tulip shit since actual research only found six individuals with significant financial collapse (six individual people) and those could not be linked to tulip investments of any kind (lack of paper trail).  IF the fabled tulip bubble were real, it would be more akin to the Beanie Babies or Pet Rock trends.  Consumer items.
Bitcoin has genuine societal functionality (much closer to TCP/IP protocol invention) that lubricate and enable society.  (Cite:  256k+ retailers in Japan, largest shopping center in Seoul S.Korea, large dollar items like homes and cars sold for bitcoin, remittance by foreign workers, etc) Bitcoin enables the unbanked to participate in commerce (as in, they can make and sell goods w/out a bank account).  Bitcoin enables commerce in spite of geographically disparity, grandma can ship her one-of-a-kind knitted booties to Kenya if there is a customer.  The shipping has been there for a long time, but the payment mechanism made it cost prohibited prior to bitcoin.
Sitglitz is viewing life through a lens of someone with access to money and resources who will never have to decide between groceries or fuel to get to work.

The reason people are giving you a calculator is because if you own 0.001 BTC now, in the future you will still own 0.001 BTC.  The value is determined by the price for 1 BTC.  So, if it is $10/BTC or $100,000/BTC you take that number and multiply it by the amount of BTC you hold (0.001 in this scenario).
NOW, the price of BTC is rising and if you search in r/bitcoin for "Moon Math" you will get a couple spreadsheets that have worked out PAST PERFORMANCE "velocity" and projects forward to dates when bitcoin might hit key values ($10k, $100k, $1,000k).  Those are only simple calculations projecting past performance forward.  They are not likely to happen as shown!  It is a simple math exercise.  
The actual price of bitcoin relies on the complexities of market demand, technology stability, and government regulations.  If anyone here could accurately project such things, they would not need bitcoin to become rich.

BItcion transactions are totally in your control.  So, go look at a car being sold for bitcoins... you can transfer them while you're standing there.  The exchange of bitcoin to/from fiat is another story and highly regulated...that's why you end up using exchanges to acquire the bitcoin itself.  In the future, more people will be able to just earn their bitcoin directly (I give 10% discount to clients who pay in bitcoin).  Until then, if you're being paid in USD, then you'll need an exchange to acquire BTC.

If you want to have your private keys, you have to put your BTC into their multi-sig vault, so the BTC will be in a state where it's offline and it will take them a week to put it back online if you want to buy something or sell it OR you'd have to import your keys into a private wallet.  If you're just holding, then the multi-sig vault gives you keys and them keys so that you can access your coins w/out anything being done on Coinbase.
Coinbase will auto create a new wallet with the split B2X coins for you if your coins are on there at the time of the split.  Only coins already in your account will be doubled (so the buy cut off is about Nov 9th so that the coins are credited to your account in time).  They've said they'll unlock the accounts for trade/sell/moves 24-48hrs after the split happens.
They're a regulated US company and, as a result, follow the rules about identifying their customers and participate in Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering regulations (mandatory for all regulated banks).
They charge fees because they're a for profit organization.  Their fees are not the cheapest on the block.  But, they are well established, backed by both banks and professional organizations (as in investors to Coinbase), and they're insured against certain things, like if their systems were hacked.
They provide a debit card ($10 fee) that allows you to spend directly from a BTC funded account. (The Shift Card)

You won't get it on a $100 basis... if your wallet holds .75 BTC, then you'll get a B2X wallet with .75 B2X in your account.  B2X is currently valued at around USD$1100.  When the open trading again, you can sell/trade/move it as you like.

When I was looking for people to spread Christmas cheer to this year and asked "Do you have any bitcoin yet?" the responses have all been "No, not yet."  Last year, it was "What is bitcoin?" ... so, that's an improvement.  (Each year, I've been giving $10 to people through my Coinbase account by sending it to their email address).
One person from last year bought in for $500 and sold out when they'd doubled their investment.  They just bought back in a couple weeks ago and also bought $100 worth for each of their kids for Christmas.  Email from that person said "I thought I'd get them $100 each for Christmas, but at this rate, it's going to be $150 each before I can give it to them."

For that to be the case, you'd need all of Asia to walk away from it.

if they make a coin smaller than the USD penny... that doesn't make any more USD available, it just makes each one more divisible.  If they start selling gold by the mg ... it doesn't make an ounce of gold any more or any less than an ounce. (well, unless it was certified by the Canadian Mint...then you might be fucked).
Inflation is when added USD are authorized and then put into circulation so that there are actually MORE USD available to be used.  
An example of "inflation" is when a company with 1 million shares (stocks) decides to issue another million shares.  That makes a total of 2 million shares available and the holders of the original million shares are now holding something only half as valuable because there are more total shares and they (the original holders) now only hold half of the company.  In stocks, this is called dilution of value instead of inflation.  It's like if you had 100% wiskey and poured an equal amount of water into it.
If that same company had their 1 million shares run up to $10k each and decided no one was buying at that price (because you have to buy whole shares), so did a stock split ("break each satoshi into 100 parts") so that each holder of 1 orig share now holds 2 share worth the same amount, that is not inflation, not dilution... that is a stock split and I can now find two buyers for $5k each instead of having to find one buyer willing to pay $10k

Bitcoin is entering into the "early adoption" phase  (  ).  It is going to have short term volatility due to low volume of buyers and sellers.  You've just been through a price run up (from new people coming in and buying = buy pressure) and now the correction (the flush of new buyers is past and it gets back to routine buy/sell only a bit fatter).  
In a way, think of it like you went to a holiday meal, everyone over ate and felt fat and bloated (the $11k) and so the next 12 hours they are less active than normal (the dip to $9k = lack of buy pressure at same time people are taking profits for hitting the $10k mark) until they come back into balance. 
Few people over eat at a meal and drop dead, so people don't fear that, they understand they're going to be sluggish for a while.  Eventually, you'll get to that same comfort with bitcoin volatility.  Look back at when we hit $8k.. same burping going on.

you fund a bitcoin wallet on their site and the BTC is converted at point of purchase.  I have one and have never had trouble with it.

Look at it this way.  No matter what price you bought in at, you haven't lost a single cent so long as you haven't sold it.  So, take a deep breath, maybe walk away for a month, then check back and see where stuff is.  It's fun to watch it do a run up like that, but BTC doesn't do a straight line rise.  Keep in mind that both South Korea and Japan are coming online this summer.  As an example, Japan has maybe a couple hundred businesses accepting bitcoin now, but will have over 300k accepting it by end of summer.  
ALSO, remember that as bad as the prices are falling... India and Australia are experiencing shortages because the demand is so high.   This shortage may have given them the break they need, but it is still a strong demand if you can outstrip the supply.

That's part of how they make money.  Every money exchanger (USD/BTC) will have a spread.  Look at buy/sell on localbitcoin or at any bitcoin ATM that provides both buy/sell services.  Are you trying to say a $25 spread is too much?

NO it isn't money laundering at all (as long as you do all the paper work), but the transaction pattern can set off automated systems designed to pick up on money laundering.
The automated systems would be embeded in regulated banks.  So, if you're not using a bank in any of your transactions (e.g. coinbase is regulated, so even coinbase is obligated to have anti-money laundering systems in place), then it wouldn't be an issue that I can tell.

So far, South Korea, Japan, and Australia have made significant and public news towards legitimizing bitcoin this year.  China has had a 'tiff' with it that was resolved without banning bitcoin (but China still has to ban it at least five more times this year to keep up appearances).  
The EU/Euro has been on shaky ground, the USD's exuberance over the Trump election is waning, Venezuela is still a shit hole, Mexico is still having significant trouble that might be exacerbated by the US actions.  The TPP got yanked, NAFTA may be yanked.
So, there is enough positive on the one side to give a better comfort level to those who might think it's just an "internet fad," enough churning in traditional economic markets to make it an interesting alternative to traditional stuff like gold/silver, and enough history behind bitcoin to show it is technically on fairly sound footing... that new people taking interest is justifiable.  Those new people would represent new demand.  That new demand is coming after the half-ing that actually lowered the supply. So, even if demand had stayed flat since last year, the half-ing alone would have increased the price.
Is it running up too quick?  Meh... it is worth what people are willing to pay for it.  If fewer people want it or are less willing to pay the higher price or large numbers decide to take profits at the same time, then the price will eventually fall.
Anyone that says they can point to "x" as the reason for the upswing in a multibillion dollar "economy" is full of shit.  There are millions (even billions) of individual decisions causing the price to be what it is.

Yeah... I never go back and look at the current value of what I paid last month... if I did, I'd get sick.  BUT, part of driving BTC is to make it something that vendors accept so it has more utility than just being that strange internet money.  So, I'm happy to take the hits for the team. :D

No idea. Never asked for it and it has a "increase your limit" option to the side, so apparently it can also be made higher.
All I know is that I've been using bitcoin for 5+ years and I do consulting work paid in bitcoin, so get paid in fairly substantial amounts.  I also do not have anything to do with gambling, porn, or drugs.

You've triggered a "potential theft" signal. (I've had my card suspended for going to a different country as a possible theft situation, so there are all sorts of low level controls in place)  
Call the bank, talk to them about what you're doing and see if they'll release it. Odds are they're going to say no.  But, you can at least try.
Why is this a theft signal?  Because frequent low value charges could go unnoticed by the valid owner or a business might be running charges (esp if the same amount each time) because their having an IT problem or because they're shady.  The valid owner might not notice it for a period of weeks and that would end up with a shit ton of charge back expenses.

Their interface is not the best, both the buy and sell tabs look very similar and you have to be careful that you're actually selling (the default is buying)... sounds like he attempted to buy instead of sell.

Well, I was speaking in general.  But, LocalBTC is a money exchange enabling service. So, if someone uses it once.  Probably no problem.  But, you make 4 sales a month... I'm going to guess that's a business that (as a money exchange) is heavily regulated.  Part of the reason for the regulation is to prevent money laundering.

It's part of their KYC/AML program + security.  As you show they type of customer you are, your limits will be adjusted.  E.g. link a commercial bank account, provide complete identification... your limits will likely be higher.  Send/receive coins from shady services like gambling or porn and you account might be suspended.  I've been on coinbase for several years (maybe 5?) and my weekly limit is USD $50k and I've never once asked for it to be increased, they just increased it over time.

actually, BTC went 1400 to 1500 in maybe two days, 1500 - 1600 in about a day.  And in the 2.5 hours since it topped 1600, it's over 1633... so if the rate stays steady, will top 1700 tonight.
I think a more realistic expectation is for a spike followed by profit taking, followed by a long trough to gather steam again.
@_date: 2017-05-22 10:28:30
I can only say what I do.  I've been around bitcoin for about 5 years now.  
I work for bitcoin when ever I can move a client over to it (I typically give a discount to get them there).  I buy bitcoin on a routine basis DCA style.  
Based on my "research" (basically following the forums) I have in my mind a set dollar amount where I will stop buying and ride out what I think will be a bubble.  I fully intend to take profits at as close to the top of the bubble as possible (I have an idea of where I feel "the top" will be), then wait for it to fall back again, expecting another long (multi-year) low trough to follow the way it did last time. I also have a set dollar amount where I will start buying again on the other side of the bubble that I expect to happen.  
I'm specifically not providing numbers because I am not a professional, this is a hobby for me, and I do not want a bunch of people to go off the word of a stranger on the Internet in making their own financial decisions.  SOme time back, I did lay out my expectations and the basis to a friend of mine who did invest with the intent of doubling her money.  She's done that and moved most of it back to USD now to terminate her exposure, (just keeping a small amount in the account to justify keeping it open). 
This (with the dollar set amounts, etc) is how I feel comfortable making my investment decisions. I understand why I've chosen the amounts I have and what my expectations are based on.  Of course, it could all go kaflewie and I will have to live with that.  But, I'm also comfortable with my odds there too.

In purchases that I make now, the "product" is valued in USD and they just generate the BTC equiv for me to accept.  Some vendors I deal with are also with Coinbase, so their transactions are pretty fast and (likely) sort of cheap judging by when I send BTC to other Coinbase customers on my own.  
You need a phone to make the transaction, most phones support a QR code reader, so... as long as you trust the app that is telling you how much the value of that amount of BTC is in your chosen currency, it isn't likely that you'd type anything at all.

Have you looked at Coinbase's multisig vault?  Move it there and download the normal local private key + your encrypted private key.  That way, you can spend from your "paper wallet" (you might want to store it in a couple NFC tags and place them around the house instead) and if need be you can still spend them from your Coinbase account.

If you can prove the cost of electric and devices you could have deducted those in the year that you mined them as business expenses... otherwise, your cost basis is $0.  BUT, if you're over $10k, you REALLY need to keep evidence of your mining because for all anyone knows, they were payment for drugs or part of a money laundering scheme.

From same FAQ:


- 60 million ether created to contributors of the presale 
- 12 Million (20% of the above) were created to the development fund, most of it going to early contributors and developers and the remaining to the Ethereum Foundation 
- 5 ethers are created every block (roughly 15-17 seconds) to the miner of the block 
- 2-3 ethers are sometimes sent to another miner if they were also able to find a solution but his block wasn't included (called uncle/aunt reward)
So, of the 92.4 million in the remark below, 60 million were "pre-mined" for the presale and another 12 million are controlled by the select central group doing development.  So, that's 72 million of the 92.4 million number being used to calculate the "market cap" right now.

In the US, long term capital gains (assets held longer than a year) are not taxed until around $30k (maybe $35k?).  Look up long term capital gains tax on the IRS website for more information.

The overhead for implementation, the fact that the number of people who even know what a bitcoin is is extremely low, fewer still have any idea of how to buy it and you're going to force people with perfectly fine banking accounts to go buy an intermediate product to pay for services?

Addiction is a result of dopamine rushes.  They found that with gamblers, it isn't the win/lose that they're addicted to.  That doesn't create much if any dopamine release. It's the expectation that gets them addicted, the expectant state creates a large rush of dopamine.  AND, it can actually be addicting (e.g. cocaine, lottery tickets, you name it) because your body up-regulates the dopamine receptors, so requires more.
IF you are getting beyond just fascination with it, try putting a timer on your device (phone, pc, ???) and only check when the timer goes off to space out the dopamine effect.  OR just do what I do. I'm on a PC, I have a browser tab on bitcoinwisdom so that tab displays the price at a glance.  No rush needed because it's like a clock sitting on my pc.  it's always there so no state of "expectation" when I go to check.

Coinbase is a US based company that is regulated because of the USD exchange portion of their business. Federal regulations require them to verify your identity just like any bank is required to verify your identity before they open an account for you.

Last week you buy 2 bitcoin for $4000 (all fees, etc included) and that's the first BTC that you've ever bought, so cost is $2k/btc.  
Today BTC is valued at $2.5k 
You spend .5 BTC on ETH. 
So, you've spent $2500 x .5 = $1250 worth of BTC 
that had a cost basis of $2000 x .5 = $1000. 
Your taxable gain is $1250 - $1000 = $250.
Your cost basis for the ETH is $1250, so when you sell that, your gain/loss will be the difference between the $1250 and the value at the time of sale.
You use the OLDEST bitcoin first when figuring out your cost basis for taxable gains.
And, yes it's a pain, so the best bet would be to keep a spreadsheet of your buys and sells in order to keep it straight.
