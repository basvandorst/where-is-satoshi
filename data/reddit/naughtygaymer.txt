I built my PC in 2012 when we had parity for a short time. Got some kickass deals from buying in the States.
Wish it would happen again :/

TBH, I love our monopoly money. It's robust, easy to identify, and it has a FUCKING HOLOGRAM ON IT WHEN YOU SHINE A LASER THROUGH IT.

*Or do you oppose freedom?*
My mistake, I meant strawman.
However, there is no rational thought process behind thinking the government only exists to war monger and promote violence, hence the use of non-rational thought inducing substances. Unless you are talking about very specific countries other than what I assumed we were talking about, your views are extremely radical. 
The notion that you think governments *sole* purpose is to gain power through violence is outlandish and frankly scary to think you believe it.

I beg to differ.

One of the main points of anarchism is the presence of stateless societies. So when you want governments to fail, you want a stateless society.
If you believe that, "Governments are just monopolies on the use of force and violence against others" you might need to lay off the hallucinogens. 
I also like your use of an attempted Ad hominem, very intelligent.

Says the guy who wants governments to go bankrupt and fail.
