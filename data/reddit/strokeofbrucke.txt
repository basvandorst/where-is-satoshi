Inflation is not necessarily an increase in the supply of money. It's a decrease in the purchasing power of goods, or an increase in the price value of goods. An increased supply of money can be a cause for inflation, but is not the same thing.

Corporations are people, after all. According to the Supreme Court.

This is correct. Bitcoin is currently considered an asset, and is only taxable when sold (in the US).

"...so we cash them out upon receipt." Every company which accepts BTC likely does this, and it effectively drives down the value of BTC.

I think what you did is exactly right. It should be treated as an asset with capital gains and losses until a law is passed stating it is to be treated as a currency (the tax rates are better with capital gains anyway). Just remember, for anyone who's not familiar with income taxation rules, you only report the gains (or losses) when you've sold the asset.

It depends on when you bought them. Generally, you would want to report the older investments first, because the tax rate is lower on long-term investments than short-term ones. But long-term is considered an asset held for at least one year, so that may or may not apply here. Also, depending on your income level, you may not even have to pay a capital gains tax on bitcoins you've had for over 1 year.
