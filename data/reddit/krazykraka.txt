Lol the majority of buyers of USD are not war-stricken countries

How can you identify this issue and not think it can become a real problem? There are plenty of reasons why a tech-savy investor would decide to develop this for another altcoin, the major one being to make money.

Yeah I'm sure you prefer Bitcoin because it is more accessible than banks. You're a fucking moron, your stupidity is destroying any semblance of credibility this argument could have. God this subreddit has gone to shit.

So not always? How is that safe...?

This is complete garbage

Please enlighten me as to how that does not affect Bitcoin. You make absolutely no sense

This hits the issue right on the spot. It's alarming that these blind bitcoin followers deny this...

This guy gets it. Now can you explain to me what exactly is the blockchain? and how are electronic coins created?
@_date: 2014-03-17 23:02:41
What a stupid analogy, your clearly no nothing about the Dogecoin community.
@_date: 2014-02-04 17:53:02
Yes I also think ease of use will play a major part in this. Until it gets more accessible or at least benefits from a clear structure, bitcoin is no better than other alts

Yeah was not expecting that...
