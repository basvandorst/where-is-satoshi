Just now seeing your comment... Yes, I canceled twice and on my third try I let it sit and it finally went through after a few hours. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:38:13
Wierd... I sent a transaction with 413 sat/byte and mine is doing the same... Unable to broadcast. I wasn't being cheap and still got this. Anyone know why? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:24:14
Well shit. It's doing it again. Something has to be wrong with the network. I paid $20 in mining fees to broadcast that transaction and now it still says unable to broadcast. WTF? Anyone? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:03:09
I canceled then resent. Had to wait about 2-3 mins for the cancelation to refund in my account. Actually thought it would take longer. I upped it to 576 sat/byte so hopefully that will get it done! 
@_date: 2018-09-07 22:05:26
Lol... It's definitely true...and hopefully I'll be able to prove it. I'm going to start data mining the drive  ASAP. Obviously if I find anything y'all will know because I'll post it here. And if I don't... I'll post that too. 
@_date: 2018-09-07 23:30:01
How so exactly? Did you serve? Explain your statement and we'll see who's the douchbag. I can already tell you're a jealous cunt who doesn't want prosperity for anyone else so there's that. Anything else?

I don't remember. I know it was a BTC wallet used on my Blackberry pearl and initially I thought it was mycelium but that didn't exist until 2013. I bought these coins around May-July 2010 time frame and with predeployment training I got distracted from BTC and completely forgot about it. Anyways. Just my luck in a series of unfortunate events in my life. I've had 36 surgeries since I was 16. I'm 35. But I do have a wife and 3 beautiful boys all healthy. So I guess I have that going for me. Even though my wife wanted to divorce me when I eluded to my epiphany of remembering about the BTC I bought all those years ago and have no way of finding it. I'm on here as a last resort for ideas.

Well I began military service when I was 21 and had only an ACL Reconstruction when I was 16 before that... So I can see how this statement may have been personal to me. So I've had 35 surgeries since I was 30 and I'm 35. How's that? 
@_date: 2018-09-07 23:21:30
Exactly, look at my post history. Do I post very often? I'm not an attention whore so I really don't care if you believe me or not. 
I was just trying to get other ideas because short of data mining I have no other options that I knew of. 
@_date: 2018-09-07 21:52:57
I knew that, but wasn't sure if there was another way back then besides the seed words. I remember writing them down just not on what. I also stored them on my laptop. But that got hit with ransomware back in 2013. I still have the HDD but I doubt I can pull anything from it. Ugh. This is just my luck. I scored on something amazing and I screwed it up. 
@_date: 2018-09-07 23:27:36
I am bothering...now. I just remembered a couple weeks ago and I've been through all my deployment boxes to look at my notebooks to see if I wrote anything down in there... No luck but I'll push on with data mining my HDDs.
I rarely post on reddit. So I'm not an attention whore and I just needed some ideas thrown out there to see if there were chances of recovering any other way than seed words. I "know" there isn't but just was seeing because of when I made the wallet... It was the early days so I just didn't know. And by the way I have memory problems from service connected injuries so I have a hard time remembering things.
I appreciate everyone's thoughts but I can do without the BS and name calling. I'm sure there are hundreds or even thousands of people saying this same stuffish to get attention but I'm not them. Just FYI. 
@_date: 2018-09-07 23:19:14
I don't remember when I made my first full node. Can't remember if I started back then. I started one last year but it's irrelevant. If I data mine my old HDDs from my rig can you tell me what to look for? I'm going to Google it if you don't feel like explaining on here but it's going to be later this weekend. 
@_date: 2018-09-07 22:03:28
I actually am an IT professional and knew this was a dead end but I just thought I'd ask for ideas anyways. I got back into crypto about a year ago. And just remembered this a couple of weeks ago. But I haven't data mined the HDD yet. I think I'm afraid that I won't find anything. But if I don't try I'll never know I guess. Yes I know it's life changing money... But my luck sucks so bad if I didn't have bad luck I wouldn't have any luck at all. Guess we'll see. 
@_date: 2018-09-07 21:51:00
It wasn't Mycelium...honestly now I can't remember what wallet it was. I was using a Blackberry Pearl (IKR)... But I do remember buying about 2,000 coin for $20. But like I said I was on a deployment and got side tracked and forgot all about the BTC. Plus my shitty carrier sacked my phone before I got back anyways. I was with Cellular South which is now CSpire. Who told me I'd have 15mo to collect my phone before it was recycled. I got back 11 mo later and they recycled my phone AND my number that I had since I was 15. I was so pissed. 
@_date: 2018-09-07 22:10:00
Yeah I didn't think about it that way. You're probably right. I'm already a paranoid vet so I don't need that addition stress to think about. Good advice. Thanks. 
@_date: 2018-08-28 21:42:10
No one thought it was going to spike like it did last year. What happens when more investment money rolls into BTC? Price goes up. So we'll just have to wait and see. 
@_date: 2018-10-01 21:57:46
I dumped 20 bucks in chief not $40k... Dunno where the hell you came up with that. 
@_date: 2018-10-01 21:43:11
Hahahaha... Thanks, I see if I can give that a shot. So far I haven't came across anything yet. But once I give the drives a go and if I don't find anything I'll send them to a data recovery service to see if they can find anything. But I have 13TB of drives to go through and I work, have kids, baseball, soccer, archery, and doing this on my own time is taking quite a while.

I don't have any "stories" to keep straight. It's easy when a person isn't lying. Your half-assed attempt to call me out as being a lier is ridiculous and makes no sense in itself. As I said previously stated I just remembered all of this about a month ago or so now. So last year when I got back into crypto I didn't remember that I made this purchase. So your whole premise of my lying has zero merit.
My posts from 10mo ago were probably referring to the new, at the time, Bitcoin IRA, which I swapped my cash in the IRA and invested with Bitcoin IRA with a rollover.
My OP for this whole thread was about ideas to recover a wallet. I only knew of seed words but considering my transaction was back in the summer of 2010 I didn't know if the wallets back then were different, maybe less secure and easier to recover. That's the main focus of my endeavor.
I don't need your attention or comments. I'm not on here touting that I'm a millionaire or "Oh man I would be a millionaire if I hadn't lost those coins, doh!". That's so stupid and ridiculous I just couldn't understand why anyone would do that for attention. I have a wife, 3 boys and a job. Between all of them I don't have time nor the care to get online and post some shit like this just to get some attention and I pity the person that does that because they need some friends or a life. I, sir, have a life and only wanted to garner ideas on recovering a wallet from a long ass time ago.

Nice, take a cheap shot at a person with trauma-related memory problems. 
You think you're funny? You're not. 
@_date: 2018-10-04 04:03:42
It's called math you fucking brain dead asshole...they were a penny each when I bought $20 worth. Take your no-math skills having ass to another thread to bother others, the adults are talking in here.

Nah, I just use bitcoin to buy my drugs... I mean after all that is all the news said is the reason for its existence...EVIL. Cryptocurrency is only for drug deals, money laundering, sex slaves, murder for hire, identity theft, elaborate (or not so elaborate) scams, etc etc.
The biggest problem I've seen on the news outlet reporting this garbage goes without saying that fiat is used for the very same things every single day. And heaven forbid they list one of the vast positive things about cryptocurrency.
Banks in general are in for trillions of losses per year if crypto becomes main stream but only if they don't adopt. They're going to lose money anyways so why not try to cut the losses and get in the game? But it's not just the banks. Governments don't want to lose control of regulatory oversight in the name of protection for the consumer. 
@_date: 2018-06-27 01:57:40
To my knowledge the US treasury wants people to report it as capital gains on any crypto sold and exchanged for fiat. No matter if you lost money while it was in crypto. Which I think is complete bullshit. Are they going to give me a capital loss % back on deposited fiat that lost value? Fuck NO.
And as I understand it as long as you're not withdrawing for fiat then no taxes are owed. So I never withdraw mine. I will either use it, hold it, or try to make short term gains by trading. BUT to CYA keep up with deposits, current rates of the crypto when depositing and the same when withdrawing. That way if the IRS does come knocking you might could prove a loss. Of course, to me, I'd only do that if I were running a business. 
This really is a multi-faceted issue. Which is why the SEC is trying to get cryptocurrency classified as a security so they can regulate it. However, not all cryptos are created equal where one looks like a security and another like a currency. So it's probably going to be on a case by case basis of each coin of whether or not it is a security or currency. 
We could go on and on... But I digress. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:25:04
Also, it doesn't seem you can hold your own private keys using these IRA custodians.  I'd really like to know if anyone else is doing this or just buy them on our own.  With that being said do we just pay taxes on a coin cashout? Ex. I have 3 BTC and I cash out 1 for $xxxx. Am I supposed to report that on a 1099?  REALLY CURIOUS HERE lol

Update on going with BitCoinIRA... I opened account with them on November 2nd. They were prompt, very courtesy, and was willing to go into great detail for any explanation they had to offer upon questioning. I was pleased with the customer service. We communicated through emails and direct calls. They were very helpful throughout the entire process.
One caveat that I either overlooked or was not listed. They have a minimum of $20,000 investment to open an account AND only allow you to buy into BITCOIN until you have I believe it was $25,000 in contributions THEN you can diversify your funds with altcoin. This absolutely was not on their sign up information. Even during the very first page of What kind of account do you want to open? How do you want to fund the account? (Ex. Wire Transfer, IRA rollover, etc.) you selected different generic options of how you wanted to diversify your portfolio. I think there were 3 or 4 different choices, with pie chart graphs to visually show the percentages,  was 100% bitcoin,  was say 75% bitcoin 25% Ethereum,  was 50% BTC, 25% ETH, and like 5x5% of other altcoin. They were in my mind just an overview of the options and not actual options that you were choosing at the time for initial investment. 
Now the initial investment dollar amount could be just a number made up on the fly depending on how the market is doing to encapsulate the most capital transfers as possible or its just their minimum investment to open the account. Either way I was okay with that I just would have liked to known that up front BEFORE I filled out the entire application and spoke with my representative a few different times through email exchanges.
I really didn't want to start out with $20k opening up the account so I tried to haggle on the opening account initial investment. I got them down to 14,000 ($10k IRA rollover and $4k cash wire transfer; of which I decided to make it an even $15,000) for my initial investment. There was a couple of times my representative had to step away from the phone or simply turn as ask his boss "Could accept this initial investment amount".
Still waiting to hear back about the clearance of the first IRA Rollover wire transfer (from another investment firm). I haven't initiated the cash wire yet since one they haven't asked for it and two I'd like to see the account opened up with my $11,000 from my other IRA rolled over to this account.
I was trying to make the fork and was told that it would likely make it in time as wires can take as little as 24hrs but up to 7-10 business days. Obviously I wouldn't have made the fork, if it had happened. So once I get everything initialized with my new investment account I'll come back on here with another update on the process, pitfalls, fees and anything else you guys would like to know.

GDAX is a more advanced platform of coinbase. You can actually use your coinbase login info to log into GDAX.

Can we open up an etrade account and buy cryptocurrency now? I really didn't think about that option before going the BitCoinIRA route. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:17:29
Errmygaaawwd...this could get complicated.  I can't imagine the IRS will be able to keep up with all of our private transactions.  Of course if you don't cash out then I guess you're not subject to gains seeing as how you could potentially lose them at any time with this volatile market.
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:48:20
No, not borrow from 401k...this IRA method allows us to either buy stock in coins or buy them outright. All without messing up your savings. If you have a 401k you'll have to roll it into an IRA then you can use a company like bitcoinira to create the necessary avenues (an LLC) for you to trade. They handle all the legal hurdles that it would be a huge pain in the ass to do yourself and not screw it up. Plus you have them to fall back on if something is wrong with paperwork and legal issues. They're also insured like another posters said by Lloyds of London. A very high dollar insurance company. So you can believe they're legit. I've got a much better understanding of all this... Thanks for all the input peeps. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:13:48
So maybe the best option to being able to tap into your already invested 401k or IRAs and get them into coins. I would think that I could use that money to buy bitcoins (altcoins) and then send them to my private wallet in my own personal storage. However, would that mean those coins held in my private storage are subject to capital gains? Seems like it could be a way around keeping most of my coins in their wallet, which we do not control (fully).
