Have you tried it with chrome? Sometimes it doesn't load or synch with other browsers
@_date: 2018-01-14 21:17:33
Glad to hear that! May you have a long and crypto-filled life buddy :D

I would make sure my mother, father and sister are financially safe for the moment (even if this means only buying them a car)

The only thing i would import from Lebanon is Mia Khalifa. 
Edit: Hmm would she take cryptopayments....?
@_date: 2018-01-14 12:39:45
Try it again with another browser or on another wifi, very strange but my mistake was doing it on a pc in a at work, i got home and everything was working

I really was waiting for his face to show up

Ok buddy :D Love you too mighty keyboard warrior &lt;3

Do you get forked coins if you leave your coins on a ledger?
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:09:11
FFS it's not good for my mental health :p I can't see why i would lose any money because it was allready on my ledgerwallet and the last transaction was already completed on the blockchain info when i checked it
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:43:07
Mine does the same when i'm on my work network, when I use wifi, it's fixed. Maybe this will help?
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:24:30
I've recovered the old one with my Original 24 words. When I start him up now, it only shows "settings"?
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:41:39
Ok, thanks guys, i just gonna wait it out and hope the api gateway will be fixed asap
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:19:25
Please look for a nano S of a trezor hardware wallet, you're in control of your own money, so sorry for your loss
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:33:55
But i've already recovered my Original account, so i downloaded the bitcoin app again but when i open it, it doesn't do anything (where normally you have to choose between bitcoin and bitcoin cash)
@_date: 2017-12-05 09:15:08
I think that it's really a good invest too, because I don't trust platforms like poloniex of coinbase to hold my money, even though they are insured. Thanks for the info! 
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:17:03
FFS man, i've been stressing although i'm certain that i didn't loose any money, but still...
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:18:02
0,25 is 3500dollar? If this isn't worth their time fuck them....Do like me, ledger nano S all the way 
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:21:35
Yes indeed, but I don't mind spending 50-70 for a safe way to store my coins. Paid 68dollar ( +-45Eur) 
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:21:46
At the moment, it is still only the settings menu when i plug it in and enter my password so i guess that the server problems are not over, getting pretty scared over here :p
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:00:51
The moment you reach a number that's high for you personally, I would recommend a hardware wallet. I've recently bought a ledger nano S, just to be safe. It's not that I don't trust coinbase or their insurance policy, but it just feels more safer when you alone have the keys. So my man, buy yourself a ledger nano s.
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:17:43
i only did the reset application data. How can I reset the entire device? I saw on twitter that there are problems with te servers. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:25:31
So worst case scenario i've to put in the seed words on a site and i can control and see the transactions and amounts? Thanks for the help guys! 
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:32:00
Too bad you won't come to Europe, I would love to be a part of it! And to get myself some Btc ofcourse ! :D All the best with you plan sir! 
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:51:09
But i already did? i've entered a new password and the 24 words? I will do this again now just to be sure
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:15:10
I will give it a go and enter 3wrong passwords and my 24 words again in the way you said it, hopefully this helps.
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:31:33
The one adresse already had btc on, from my previous transactions and the other one is completed in the blockchain, so i guess it hangs around in the gateway between blockchain and ledger wallet, i didn't use any wrong addresses 
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:38:03
I look at it like the way you said, people are starting to realize that there are more and better crypto's for daily buys and groceries than btc. But is this a bad thing? I think not, gold has it's place in the world, same as its value. Just like btc. I will never look at btc as a everyday currency, more like virtual gold.
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:21:01
I've resetted the whole ledger but instead of recovering the old one i've made a new 24 word seed, now i recovered succesfully the old one but there is only a menu settings on the screen? Does this mean the new wallet with the new 24 seed is active on my ledger and i have to buy a new ledger and direcly recover it again?
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:32:00
Ledger Nano S, simple and safe!
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:02:00
When i checked my nano S, I saw the previous bitcoin transactions but not the last one, so i looked it up on the blockchain and it said completed, I didn't notice it on my ledger so i went in my tools menu and resetted the app (as shown on the official site) and now i don't see anything, no transactions and 0 balances. When i refresh i get a api error that says that my synchronisation isn't completed
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:32:56
You've been a great help but there's nothing I can do, i've made a ticket with the support group, hopefully they can help me. Pretty fucked up situation because it started with one transaction that got stuck between the blockchain and the api-gateway, should have never reset my account but i'm still sure i didn't lose money because it's already on my wallet, thank you very much fine sir!
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:34:31
i've reset my ledger and accidentally made a new one with another 24 words. I've recovered the old one with my seed words but I only get "settings" when I open it, does that mean i need to buy a new ledger now because the "new" wallets with the new 24words is active?
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:53:28
Sometimes when you are on a server or network (work or school) it doesn't sync correctly. No worries, you're money is safe as long as the confirmations are complete and ofcourse the adresse is correct
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:22:14
Everything is fixed, included the last transaction, ffs nearly shat my pants in 7 colours today, thanks for the help Honeybadger!
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:02:09
What do you think of ledger nano S? I recently bought one, just to be safe and responsible for my own keys/money.
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:24:48
After the refresh it says: Your wallet may not be up-to-date because the last sync did not complete succesfully. Then you click on more info and it says the API gateway is having server issues. I hope it's fixed quickly, thanks for the help guys.
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:28:10
I've noticed that there are 2different adresses but that's completely normal isn't it? Thanks for the help guys, I wasn't worried about any loss but it still crosses your mind sometimes.
@_date: 2017-12-05 09:06:47
It's just because I know what i'm doing that I don't really trust any platforms or other cryptosites to hold my share of the cryptocake. Thanks for the info!
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:02:23
Yes, i've checked the legacy and segwit possibilities

The fact that me and others feel bad for you, isn't gonna help you but I really hope you get your money back. Broke or millionair, 17K is a LOT of money. Try keeping yourself calm, ( I know it's easier said than done) You'll get throught this! Goodluck! 
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:57:34
i did it again and my device is ready now, it only says settings, sorry for all my questions
