On meth it is...

What happened to cocaine though? Will he send it?

*It's all your fault!* ^tm

Don't worry, BitCoin bubble already happened.

Just as you go to a mechanic with your car he goes to you with his DVD. Does that make him dumb? He created multi-million company, you connected two cables.

What did suggest year ago that MtGOX is to be trusted? Each and every exchange can pull the same trick.

I hate those pesky numbers on my dirty fiat currency. I confuse them all the time.
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:13:54
That was probably shittiest day of your life. Literally every day will be happier. Enjoy your life, bro. 
@_date: 2014-12-08 04:32:46
Yeah obviously they will out so themselves covering some random sticker. 
@_date: 2014-10-22 08:17:13
It was me. I paid him.
@_date: 2014-07-27 20:11:23
I applaud your comment, sir. So... thoughtful. 
@_date: 2014-10-20 14:10:41
Let's not forget MC and Visa - they also didn't succeed in creating their own currency... Wait... 
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:22:10
I was with you until I red this comment. Pray that your wife didn't read it, because for me it would be insta-divorce. It's one thing to lose money, but to be proud of it? Are you fucking Al Bundy?

Not using bitcoin. Put ten bucks in her hand. Wait for a day. Nothing happens. 
@_date: 2014-07-30 08:51:10
So poorest people can buy bitcoin to do what? What exactly can they do that they can't with dollars (either US or Zimbawe ones)?

WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE

Yeah, like he just given savings of his life to some stranger from the Internet... No, wait...

Your son has a strong father that had bad luck in some point in life. Stay strong, the tide will turn.

He was trying to unlock your anus. 
@_date: 2014-10-20 09:42:35
It won't fit your brain, but you seem to have free space in your skull.

All tenants couldn't possibly be thieves.

[Here]( that might be helpful in solving your dispute.

25 percent down in one day = "small price drop"
Oh my god... it's full of popcorn

Let's hope it won't end with hangover (poor pun intended)

In a world where it's bar owner leasing place for ATM, not the other way around. 
@_date: 2015-04-05 07:11:14
So that's why I had to wait for my groceries on a parking lot for 2 days before it finally cleared from my bank account? /s

Bartender jumping trough hoops to get his ass-pennies... That's almost too good to be true. 
@_date: 2015-04-05 07:05:27
Hoping that *the last one* would have candy in it? 
@_date: 2015-04-05 07:08:20
Could you explain why? I don't understand how posting account info could be damaging but I hear it on Reddit all the time. 
@_date: 2015-04-05 06:37:16
I think you offended many people. Free Software actually works. Bitcoin - not so much.
