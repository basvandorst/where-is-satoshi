I know that the BTC was desposited to shapeshift, I think the problem was when it came to turning it into tether

Don’t get me wrong I’m all for crypto adoption but things like Venmo and cash app are instant

Not the point. I hate banks just as much as the next guy but us early adopters have to understand that crypto in its current state will not appeal to the mainstream until its scalability issues are fixed. Most people would rather have the instant transfer on something such as Venmo than to wait 30+ minutes for confirmation

Unless I misunderstood, you said that many investors are pouring money into ETH without understanding what the platform is, and that they believe it to be just the "new bitcoin".  What I'm saying is that I believe people *do understand* that it is something different and that is why its market cap is so much higher than other cryptos

I have to disagree. I believe ETH is  because it is something different, not the "new bitcoin".  It is more than just a digital currency.  There are other cryptos whose goal is to be a digital currency (DASH, LTC, XMR, and others) but because ETH is something entirely different, that is why its market cap is where it is
