there can be 2 problems. i can target kraken (which i have) as well as dumb investors. if there are so many people spewing that same advice, how did it somehow miss you?
i seriously don't care about your money. or kraken. 
but i know how idiotic people can be with money, and how many opinions there are online. that's why i specifically piggy backed off someone's post, so it was clear to people that it's not one stray ultra-conservative investor who has that opinion, but that's the opinion of anyone who is experienced in investing. 
have fun though.

i hate kraken
i'm leaving kraken due to the past week of no service and shit customer service
but if "all your money" is 45k btc is may be the retardedest place to dump it all. 
it's your money though idc
the advice was more for anyone else reading who might have thought what you did was a good idea and are open to intelligent advice

i repeat, this should just be for play money. stuff you can lose and it'll bug you for a day. a week, max. 
don't put "all your money" in any investment, even a savings account has risks but this is on the opposite spectrum of huge potential win, huge potential loss.

when it comes to investing, the stuff you read other places is often the most wise, as long as you choose the right places. that's because smart investing is pretty counterintuitive to human nature. it's gambling. the house always wins, yet casinos are full. is that cliche? fuck yes. 
is it a real fact that we constantly have to remind ourselves if we don't want to be in your position, shitting bricks over the fate of all our money in an unproven model of investment that has already had people lose millions due to exchanges folding? also fuck yes. but i guess you're a leader. again, have fun.
