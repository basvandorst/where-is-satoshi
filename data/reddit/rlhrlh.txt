To further clarify, Worldcoins are often confirmed in under a minute.  Also, Scharmbeck is a company like Coinbase, but for Worldcoins.  Where Sharmbeck shines is in it's speed.  Once your account is setup and verified, you can buy and sell WDC with lightening speed (especially when compared to bitcoins.)
I get it, everyone has heard about bitcoins, but who's heard of [fill-in-the-blank-of-any-altcoin].  However, if you prefer crypto transactions that are fast enough for everyday business, all of us need to consider a better, faster alternative to bitcoin.
*personal disclaimer*:  I've been using bitcoins for nearly 3 years now and since my, literal, first day I was impressed with the concept but I knew that something faster than "one hour confirmation times" was going to be necessary for crypto-currency to be a success.  
I recommend finding a way to support BTC as a payment AND also try to find a good, innovative alt-coin that is trying improve the whole crypto-currency process.  I, of course, recommend WDC but do your research and pick the alt that works best of your personal business model.

Basically, this is a public folder on the SEC.gov site where the SEC is publishing docs regarding the Bats BZX ETF fund.
A doc was posted yesterday.  I know this isn't the acceptance/denial notice but can someone cut through the legalese and give a TL;DR on what it's about and if it's of any significance?
@_date: 2017-03-10 02:38:54
I get that.  But, you are asking my question when I posted the link.  What did the document even mean.
To be fair, someone sent me a link to the web directory and I am completely clueless.  I'm just watching the folder, waiting for a new file to appear tomorrow... though I sure that when it does, I'll have no clue what I'm looking at unless there is a big red stamp on the first page saying ACCEPTED/REJECTED!

Well played, sir.  Well played.

I don't think it means anything.  I just think he's enjoying the moment knowing that this is a rare moment when so many people are waiting on their every word.
The smirk is a small power-trip.

That's it.  Thank you.

More than anything it's psychological.
If the SEC accepts this ETF, it sends a message that the SEC is legitimizing bitcoin and, more broadly, cryptocurrencies.
Furthermore, other countries pay attention to America and it's financial policies.  This will pave the way for cryptos to behave and be treated as legitimate assets in larger financial institutions.
This also means that there will be little future-chance that the US government will shift gears and treat crypto as some form of "dirty" commodity that should be treated as an illegal tool.

Yes, I just mentioned that on another comment.  I'm actually refreshing both directories because I just don't know which might have a posting first.
@_date: 2017-03-10 19:26:18
Here-say.  I could be wrong.  That's what I get for trusting what I'm hearing from multiple others. :eye-roll:

It's been my experience that you can't use coin base unless you're willing to use their support system.
I've had more issues with them I can count. They've always resolved their issues, usually within a week, and they also at least respond within 24 hours.  Regardless, if you want to use there system, at some point something will break on your account and they will have to fix it.
@_date: 2017-03-10 16:09:14
Possibly here.  I have a browser refresher on this web directory for every 10 seconds.
@_date: 2017-03-09 21:59:25
Ah, thanks for that.   That helps a little.
@_date: 2017-03-10 15:43:00
I didn't find this to be funny until I saw the lowe-right image.
Lolz.  Good stuff.
@_date: 2017-03-09 21:55:32
Likely, yes.  It's where they would dump the document and the public would know to look to acquire info on the state of the filing.
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:07:57
Unless this is what you mean by constant refreshing, just open up the directory in your browser and install an extension that allows you to auto refresh every 10-30 seconds.
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:55:20
Well, to be clear, I'm not saying I think this could happen.  What I am saying is that if the filing is made later-than-work-hours tonight, or even tomorrow AM, it would provide significant evidence that they must still be debating this, even now.  What's more important than the debate is that they are thinking that the debate is worth that much effort and going against long-standing, existing precedent.
In other words, if they work on this at night, they know this a big deal.  A BIG deal.

Well, there are a few that have been oversold recently.  A spike in BTC means that many HODLers of these alts will want to cash out on the spike in value of BTC.  Or, that's the scuttle in the alt markets.
Anyway, if a coin crashes 10% (which can even happen under many normal circumstances) you can make a ton of money shorting.  IMHO, all alts are doomed to fail.  I use to be a fan of alts (going back to 2010) but only one cryptocurrency has remained viable.  Take a guess which one that is.

Something inside told me this was exactly what was going to happen.  If there was ever a moment for this, it is now.
Lighten up guys.  Today is going to a rollercoaster, regardless.  Have fun with it.

I really am like everyone else and I've been an armchair observer of this whole thing.  I know there deadline is, technically tomorrow, so IMHO the longer it takes them to announce, the longer it proves that this was no small debate within the SEC.
We all know that by approving this, this is significant governmental support for BTC.  In fact, many countries  look to the US so this sets precedent to some extent even beyond the US.
With that said, if a ruling isn't given until after their end-of-work day, it is my hunch that this filing will have been debated until the very in and if there is dissension within the SEC, I don't believe there's anything saying that the law makers couldn't continue arguing into the evening until they come to hard, drop-dead time.
Aside, assuming this is debated until, say 11:50PM EST.  I could see this being "approved" and all of the paperwork rubber stamped, but not published until tomorrow.  I'm not sure if publication to the public is a required aspect of a filing being approved or denied, but if the decision simply needs to be made and signed by ??? executives in the SEC, the ruling could come after the end-of-day.
This is 100% conjecture on my end but it also seems plausible IF this still being debated to the last minute.

Lol, ok.  I didn't get to see the clip (other than short gifs.)  I like this better.
Who doesn't know about bit coins?  I mean, my wife's grand parents know about bitcoins and they are in their mid-80's.
@_date: 2017-03-10 19:22:07
4:00 PM, EST.  But, work is work.  You work until the job is done.
But with that said, they are still a government organization.  They don't work over time unless they absolutely must.
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:21:07
Subscribed but I'll keep refreshing.  You never can be 100% sure which channel will be updated first.

Just be sure to make this guy the face of your product:

Seems reasonable.  However, I was willing to gamble a little on this that the filing would go through.
@_date: 2017-03-10 13:56:52
What site is that?  I use to use it in my Nxt days (years ago) but I can't recall where that chart comes from.

...or "Three more minutes and I'll be done."

Yeah, I had to post this gif because I am at work, but I'm auto-refreshing three locations-- two web directories on SEC.gov and r\Bitcoin.

This is starting to sound like the late-90s, early 2000s when razor blade manufactures were in a race to cram the most blades into a single face shaver.
Today we must worry about 3 generals but TOMORROW it will be 4!
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:18:07
Yes.  These links are to files.  The HTML files are just comments, formatted like pages which is obvious.  However, they also post documents, of which the acceptance/rejection letter should be one of them.
Don't take my words as 100% truth, though.  This is just one of two web folders that some of us have been told to follow for up-to-the-second details on the state of the ETF.
@_date: 2017-03-10 02:35:27
Thank you.  This is helpful too.
@_date: 2017-03-10 16:20:27


And this is the web directory for those files:
There's a good chance any referenced docs on that page will first be posted to this file server.
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:48:02
Someone showed up earlier over here and mentioned that there already is one in Sweden.
I only report what I hear.  You'll have to google to verify.
@_date: 2017-03-09 22:01:44
@_date: 2017-03-10 17:36:46
This just what it is- comments.  These are not SEC comments.  Just comments by outsiders encouraging/discouraging the approval.
The only news from this is that stuff is happening on the backend.  Maybe these files were posted so that the final doc has docs available for reference.
@_date: 2017-03-10 16:51:19
The funny thing is, it's my understanding that this summit has nothing to do with the BTC ETF.  You're watching some SEC event in vain.
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:24:09
Also, as evidence that this is true, when BTC spiked earlier, people dumped DASH hard.  Dash is the current alt-coin starlet.  Having one whale pump the market for 10 seconds caused a significant dump.  Not to my hopeful profitability points but still, quite a fall.
@_date: 2013-10-16 17:13:06
If you have an issue with the owner being anonymous, that's one thing.  I don't mind that you pointing that out.  However, it's also not fair to issue a "scam warning" and calling a site "shady" just because the owner is anonymous.
Lot's of businesses within the crypto world operate with anonymity.  There is a difference between telling people to be cautious and calling a service a scam.
IMHO, if you use crypto, you should be a little sceptical of everyone and every service.  MCXNow is certainly no exception.  However, at some point you need to evaluate the history of the service and it's operators and make your own judgement calls based on experience.
@_date: 2013-10-16 15:25:12
Yes, I think I also would consider the idea that people would want use a service that gives back a portion of generated profits to users who care balances of coins.
I mean, there is no way that this is a good business model!
Oh, no!  I just realized that my bank pays me interest on deposits, that come from their profits!  I guess I should withdraw my funds from them and keep my money in my mattress.
I... I just can't trust an organization that actually tries to help me be profitable!
