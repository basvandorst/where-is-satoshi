How much do you estimate it uses?i didn't realise connections could be limited to reduce bandwidth. I'm on a 80gb cap....

But it is just the same though isn't it, Bitcoin Cash HATE being referred to as Bcash and actively try to combat it, however they also do the same thing to Bitcoin by trying to drop the Cash from Bitcoin Cash and calling it Bitcoin, which spreads confusion and is pain wrong, they are different.

I don't have a big enough data plan (80gb) to run one at home, is it helpful/worth while running one in azure?

Well, that was a poor 'debate', a debate requires a moderator, this just made Jimmy look stupid. Jimmy should have spent more time talking about what Bitcoin IS and what bitcoin cash is not, not what Bitcoin cash is. Disappointing debate i feel.

'Actually' the Bitcoin devs proposed and implemented OPTIMISATIONS first and second layer in tandom, with increasing block size still left as an option, but only after the optimisations were done.

Isn't a hosted node in a datacentre by you or I, better than not having a node running at all?

What about replace by fee? Isn't that a risk for the merchant also?

Oh come on, it's not hypocrisy, it's irony. The bank is against bitcoin and mafia. There were two rogue employees, the banks' policies are 'no' for both...
