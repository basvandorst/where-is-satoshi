I was checking out stacks of Venezuelan Bolivars on ebay the other day. I was wondering if and when Venezuela is back to normal, would they keep the same bank notes? Is it worth buying a few stacks to hold on to? Or would the case of a new government after some kind of overthrow involve new bank notes. Really curious if anyone has some insight.

I'm curious op, is there ways bitcoin can help with your current fiat situation? My girlfriend still has family down there and I thought about telling them to buy bitcoin with your almost worthless currency. What do you say about that?

Lol this is how I got into bitcoin too. A few days before it went from 1800 up to 3k or whatever I spent all my bitcoin on an order of goodies. Needles to say I learned my lesson to hodl

Hey friend, my girlfriends parents are still in Venezuela suffering like shit. I knew bitcoin should be able to help them but I NEVER thought of telling them to mine! Do you have additional info on how it would go down there? Is it too risky to advise them to do? What would be a simple way for them to mine and earn some side change

My thoughts exactly. I thought I was somewhat in the loop, but this... all of this went right over my head
@_date: 2017-09-25 04:02:22
