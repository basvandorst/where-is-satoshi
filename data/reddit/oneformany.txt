Any story that begins with getting into btc way back then makes me green with envy. Simply because in an alternate universe I'd prolly be rich. This applies to anyone that has ever come into contact with bitcoin back then as well.

Woah where did you get that bitcoin logo? I need that for a 'project'

So you do store your coins on cb/gdax? I've always heard that was fine way back then but now? People keep saying if you dont have access to your own private keys then you dont really 'own' them. However i do know its ok to keep a small amount on cb like a couple hundred.
Thanks for the response btw. Makes me feel a little more at ease.

Haven't you heard all the horror stories tho? I was set finally investing a decent amount these past 3 days, about the pull the trigger any moment but i just keep reading about all that bullshit with people losing actual money. People waiting stuck in limbo for a confirmation. The amount of time to transfer from cb to gdax can cost so much money if it takes days to complete! Then moving it from gdax to a storage of your choice could also take time? I really want to invest already but im so confused on what to do. I just dl'd binance but they have problems with registering and their app apparently sucks..
Just thinking here and lmk if it is a good idea. The process of buying crypto on cb with usd is flawless since the company wants real 'physical' money. So that isnt the issue. In my case i should do it through cb since i don't plan on day trading. So the amount of time (6days) to process is fine with me. Then moving it to gdax might take few days, then i can finally move that to a storage right? But all that inbetween is what I'm scared of. All those horror stories.. have you ever encountered this? What was the longest time you waited for a confirmation?

What should i use that is easy for beginners?

How expensive is it to keep a node running? I mean we talking couple hundred or thousands for a month or year? What will be the incentive for the person spending the money to want to do this besides helping in technological growth?
@_date: 2018-01-01 18:46:50
So it increases speed of the data flow if we have more nodes? Similar to when you torrent something and a specific file has more seeds so its faster? If this is the case why doesn't everyone do this? Is there a downside to running a node?
@_date: 2018-01-03 07:33:28
Im so confused, i hear it both ways.. people buy from cb then transfer to gdax. Then i had someone say the opposite which was weird. Now you are stating to just buy straight on gdax? How low are the fees compared to their 1.49% bank fee?
@_date: 2018-01-27 07:53:13
It ends with the boy buying bitcoins and the neighbors came to say
 'such bad luck' and the farmer replies with...
'TO THE MOON!'
@_date: 2018-01-08 22:11:28
Nvm i realized why i got charged more for a btc. When you buy a decent amount they jack up the prices..
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:17:39
They don't have an instant buy feature. Its going to take maybe 5 days for it to go through. 
I dont get what you mean by 'using the exchange itself' I believe I did? Unless you talking about gdax. I won't set up and verify atm
@_date: 2018-01-06 04:01:44
I thought you only need to pay tax if you profit or invest a certain amount someone recently said its like 20k 
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:27:35
All the problems lie within its growth. Too much traffic for them to handle. The ONLY thing cb is doing right is taking fiat and giving you crypto for it in a timely manner in which they disclose to you.
Besides that.. their withdraw is the part that people keep getting fucked on. Another one is wire transfers which make no sense.. you have the ability to just link your bank and buy it through that. No point in wasting time with a wire transfer then after that processes you then use your usd wallet from cb to purchase cryptos which take even longer when in the end its practically the same as linking your bank and using that to buy
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:01:34
If only i shared your sentiment. I got spooked these past few days and kept reading horror stories for btc. Made me miss out buying more when the prices literally hit ~13k range..
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:45:55
How much of an investment or profit is needed in order for someone to 'have' to file in tax reports?
@_date: 2018-01-10 08:27:19
Not bad. It went through within the same day. I call that a win!
@_date: 2018-01-03 07:29:03
Can someone give me a rundown on how to read candle? I dont really get it
@_date: 2018-01-05 08:40:23
I dont quite get  Why do i do nothing for 30 days? Where are you even pulling this number from?
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:47:59
What do you suggest I use? 
@_date: 2018-01-05 08:25:25
I did give you a suggestion on a gambling addiction cause(the one i suggested actually help people get through it with a program and spreads awareness). This was through a pm tho. Also it fits very well with what everyone here is doing since were all pretty much gambling. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:41:10
But still who goes into the effort back in 2014 to send that small of a btc. He would literally have the enter more numbers to send that amount rather then just a simple 1 btc.
@_date: 2018-01-05 08:31:31
Dw once you cash out just use a little bit of the profits it and reinvest in a small up and coming coin and hold again!
@_date: 2018-01-01 18:15:50
Can someone please give me a quick run down on what a node is and what the purpose of us running one will do? 
@_date: 2018-01-09 18:37:16
Where you reading this info from. I like the format
@_date: 2018-01-06 04:00:27
Can you elaborate. I don't get this sentiment. Why not cash out and re buy in when you feel like it insteas of just trading frol btc to eth when one dips
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:35:50
I mean i get that, but there has to be a number right? Maybe once your investments into crypto exceed 10k? Less or more? 
@_date: 2018-01-06 03:57:59
My check didnt process start of this year prolly because of holiday purposes. I coulda bought at high 12 low 13k.. now i missed my chance because i thought 14.5k was too high then 15k.. now its just going higher. Need to wait for the drop. I'm crossing my fingers for whales to get greedy and sell and 'try' to buy back in.
@_date: 2018-01-07 07:09:28
Lmao!! I did this the whole day durinf this convention I'm at because im cosplaying as a 'bitcoin' people keept asking me for advice. Little did they know I'm just a noob who doesn't know what he is talking about and i just throw out fancy words
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:09:37
No i didn't buy a full btc. Cb to my knowledge doesn't have a sell/buy price? If they do then its private until you buy. I didn't 'lose' $200-300 i just got charged that much more on the price of a btc.
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:52:17
That makes more sense. It shouldn't say do 'NOTHING' should be create a plan and let the fact that you have a huge amount of money settle in.
@_date: 2018-01-05 08:40:06
Not only that. The coin itself can go to '0'. So you can count on it being an actual fiat
@_date: 2018-01-05 20:04:45
What do you do to take it off cb? I hear people doing it multiple ways
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:28:08
Why do you store on cb rather than gdax? I thought its the other way around where you trade buy sell using cb and move it to gdax?  
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:27:58
I'm finally able to pull the trigger on investing.. i was going to do it 1 month ago when it was around 10-11k. Regardless, i am finally able to invest after  wanting to for so long. I'm investing 3k atm. I'm not sure which place i should go to do the transaction. At first I was going to do Coinbase because apparently it is easy but now people are telling me to use gdax. Then when i opened this thread some guy said he is transferring from gdax to gatehub. I never even heard of that. So now I'm just asking for advice.is it fine to use CB if I'm not really all in on btc? Its not like I'm day trading and constantly switching my coins to alts and trying to make a profit everyday.

This is a good thing. All the scared new young investors will sell so it'll keep 'plumpeting'.

It was an inside job.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:51:54
That was a while ago im surprised you didnt have a few btc left over. Its almost like change at that point, you dont really buy the specific exact amount of btc you need to buy your 'medicine'. Unless you are the type that pays to the exact amount.
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:54:26
I hope they kept atleast some money right?
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:56:00
Woah a bit optimistic there for a 2-3k. This past 3 weeks i would be happy if it went back down to 10k under.
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:26:12
So buying from cb has the initial fee % of which ever option you choose to buy. After that move it into gdax(which is free). Then if you prefer to do so you can move that into a cold storage which is also free? Is it also free to move coins from gdax back to cb to trade? Also does converting to other alt coins have a fee?
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:10:21
Dont forget rock pet. Its a rock.. shit won't leave you, full proof

After you mine a bitcoin you have to input a command to? I'm still new to this so forgive me for my stupidity. How come after you mine it you don't just receive it? Also why does he now have to pay to have access to something he mined
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:27:39
So whats with the ridiculous price to pull the coins back out into their wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:38:07
Ok, initially why does it cost that much to even inquire?
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:53:35
I mean at that point people should be dumping a good % of their coins just as an insurance policy instead of being stupud thinking its just a bad crash that'll go back up later..
@_date: 2018-08-29 16:56:04
I was thinking about that, I'll have my standard logo in the front and a downward roller-coaster dude in the back

Same boat just the other way around I bought after the big rise. Fortunately I bought at 12-14k..sadly I didn't wait an extra few weeks and probably wouldn't of bought at all or if I did it would've been at 9-10k.
I always think about selling but it doesn't matter too much at this point. I didn't buy a lot but it wasn't nothing. Still under 1 btc. It's just crazy to think if I did wait I would have over 1 btc lol
@_date: 2018-12-14 19:42:13
I keep getting mixed messages about this. I see enthusiastic buyers still getting into it and hyping it up. Then I read articles about how it's dead and not going to last in the short run, let alone the long run. They say the technology of block chain is so advanced that we've yet to even really use it. To put it into an analogy, typing with one finger on each hand as apposed to all 5 fingers on each hand. That's how far off we are. And the reason why crypto was created is because there is a market for cash. Everyone wants money so that's how they lured people into it while incorporating Block chain tech.
To note, I want to sell but I'd be losing out on more than 50% of my initial investment.
