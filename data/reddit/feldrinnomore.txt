Hear hear. You make sense.
The whole point of Keynesian economics was to save in good times to prevent the economy from overheating, and to spend in bad times to reduce the severity of an economic slump, basically anti-cyclical policies. Governments mostly do the obverse, call for austerity in bad times and make them worse, and spend all the surplus and then some during good times. It's only to be expected though, nobody's going to be re-elected for calling for tax increases during an economic boom.
The whole Greece situation is a tragic fuckup. They've already put out more austerity measures than any other country, but there's no bloody point to it if you don't have an economy and thus no tax revenue. All the other countries calling on Greece to make ever more cuts is only going to lead to a longer, deeper economic disaster. It's like telling a starving man that he should try fasting and work harder.

And those deposits were safe. In the end they only closed down Laiki bank, deposits up to $100,000 were left intact and moved to Bank of Cyprus. Uninsured deposits above $100,000, mostly from Russians using Cyprus for tax evasion/avoidance took a hit or were frozen.

Even in Cyprus, the example continuously cited here, all insured deposits up to €100k were preserved. The brunt of the bail-in actually hit uninsured, foreign, Russian accounts using Cyprus as a tax haven.

The only thing I can imagine is that they're adding a Bitcoin derivative to their retail forex platforms. Like most commodity derivatives, it'll just track the underlying asset, BNP will make money on the sizable spread as well as commission, and the whole operation will feature a grand total of 0 Bitcoin. Like all retail trading, it's basically glorified gambling.

€100k to be precise, but yeah. They originally intended to levy a percentage on all deposits (6.7% for under, 9.9% for over €100k), but after protests the Cypriot parliament voted against the idea near unanimously (36 against, 19 abstentions, 0 votes in favor).

Nope, only speculatively. I'm in Europe and I'm generally happy with my bank account. There are no fees for domestic transfers or to use an ATM, transfers within Europe are free as well (through SEPA), and for everything else I don't mind using a credit card. 
Even if Bitcoin could save me some money on the occasional transfer outside of Europe, I don't feel like going through the hassle. Buying Bitcoin usually involves some cost as well, or requires that I open an account with an exchange (first time I bought them in 2013 was at around a 5% fee). Finally, securing Bitcoin and getting fully acquainted with the technical stuff involves way more work than any benefit I'd get out of it. Heck, I know a fair amount on Bitcoin and security, but I'm not going to bet money on it that nobody is ever going to hack my PC.

Lots of bullshit ITT.

Looks like you know how to take care of your money then. 
In terms of Bitcoin...I'd see it as a gamble, just like buying a penny stock, or some commodities. It might work, it might not. I used to have small change in about 30 cryptocurrencies, but I sold it all at around the time Bitcoin was above $1000. It was fun, but all I did was get lucky, luck is no place for any serious amounts of money.

Nowadays? I'd say as long as you're in a fairly developed country, say in Europe, the USA, parts of Asia, you should be safe under €100k.
But you shouldn't have €100k+ in a bank anyway, at least not for a long time, banks don't give enough interest to outpace inflation. It's incredibly easy to manage your own retirement stock portfolio by buying shares of a world index ETF (basically, a fund that invests in about 5000+ stocks). As long as the world economy grows, an index like that outpaces inflation and appreciates considerably in the 30-40 years until retirement.

Yeah that's a pretty huge problem. Usually, Greece (and Italy, Spain, Portugal) would've devalued their currency with slightly above average Euro-zone inflation, making it cheaper and thus more attractive for tourists. That aim runs completely counter to Germany's trade surplus of $250 billion, which benefits massively from a strong euro. 
Currently tourism is about 18% of Greece's GDP. The measures that the other Euro-countries want Greece to introduce (increased VAT) is just malicious. I'm not surprised negotiations ran aground on that point.

It works according to the 'too big to fail' mechanism. If you're doing anything with Bitcoin in a large enough quantity (and haven't yet stolen Bitcoins entrusted to you) then anything you do is justifiable and all of your crimes  and mistakes are blatant lies. Rather the heavens fall and the seas dry up than there be anything bad for Bitcoin.
Had Paoblo Escobar sold heroin for Bitcoins, he'd have been hailed as a non-violent Gandhi spreading the word of peace. Bitcoin o plomo.
