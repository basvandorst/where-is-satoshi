The answer you didn't want to hear but ultimately, the correct answer.
@_date: 2014-01-29 11:46:54
sure but this would require the seller to have access to the internet AND his wallet at the moment that I want to verify his public address. I was looking for an easy, offline way of verifying this - I should have maybe made this more clear :)
@_date: 2014-02-20 22:30:33
I had 2FA enabled. If anyone ran away with my coins it was their responsibility. That's no reason for me not to be able to withdray my coins for +12 hrs
@_date: 2014-02-20 19:11:32
I know and I know. Still, I don't like it. They can be as transparent as they want and I've been using them for months - I logged in to Bitstamp and I was told I could not withdraw my BTC, without a reason. I don't need this and I don't want this, especially in times as shaky as these. Like I said, the whole Mt. Gox thing probably made me a bit paranoid, but I don't care. This is still one big unregulated bunch of exchanges being run by inexperienced people. Some are just  being more professional about it than others.
@_date: 2014-02-20 18:51:20
I don't like this one bit. They can say whatever the fuck they want. Blocking some accounts from withdrawing BTC "to protect us"? I'm not buying it and I think they are lying. Maybe the whole gox thing made me a bit paranoid. I'm moving to Kraken.

well then it's true for some people you nitwit, it says it right here in the exact same, all caps green text.
edit: you can upvote this guy all you want, fact of the matter is that I am having this issue as well as other people and that there is no communication from bitstamp. Are you gonna come back and change your upvote to a downvote when YOU can't withdraw your BTC? 
@_date: 2014-10-29 15:10:40
have you considered that people might also use bitcoin.de? Pretty sure everyone who has a CC in Germany also has a bank account they can connect to bitoin.de

it was a seperate ticketing system,  I can show screenshots of it?

notice the total lack of timestamps etc. Also, the only thing I received to them when I noticed my miners stopped working was this vague email - 






This is where you normally assigned pools to your miners - now it turned into the abomination you see above

Hi there, my name's Jan and I'm working together with Joerg to find a streamlined and convenient way for people to sell their coins and pick up their fiat money. 
For cryptographic proof, we're thinking something along the lines of signing a message with the private key associated with the public address that sent the coins, and then showing us the result when picking up the coins. This would allow the seller to show up with just a string of numbers and letters, proving his ownership of the coins that were sent our way. (Thanks to reddit for this idea, by the way)
The Blockchain would provide us with the ideal ledger to check who deposited his coins when, and which coins get sold first. We could notify the seller that his fiat money is ready for collection by sending him a satoshi when all his coins are sold.
We are open for any ideas and recommendations that anyone might have, and very excited about the idea of running the first OABCHTP ;) cheers!

I guess so, I just bought a miner from them that they told me they would host for 12 months and then ship to me. No dividends or anything like that. Looking back it was very dumb thinking to even start mining but well

I keep hearing about multisig - what's a good online wallet that supports this and what's the idea behind it?
@_date: 2014-01-22 23:14:32
Well then we can assume the password was not very long, because otherwise I thought this was un-brute-forceable
 &lt;9 char = unsuitable for use
 09 char = insecure
 10 char = low security
 11 char = medium security
 12 char = good security (good enough for your wallet)
 13 char = very good, enough for anything.
@_date: 2014-11-24 17:01:52
I mean there are certain risks you have to expect when dealing with companies in an unregulated environment, but I'm not sure how regulated e.g. the shoelace industry is, but if I agree that someone is going to give me 20 shoelaces and ship the packaging to me, then changes it to 10 shoelaces and shuts up, that's shit you expect to be protected from some way or another? How can any company get away with flat-out 100% fraud? 
Since I paid with paypal, they will not hear the case since it's too long ago and "virtual goods"
@_date: 2014-02-05 21:07:35
Yeah I'm pretty confused by this. Your wallet seed is something you want to keep offline at all cost unless your device that is running electrum crashes and you have to retrieve your keys. For a watch-only wallet like this, wouldn't it make more sense to just input your addresses one by one? I mean it's more work but your electrum seed? Really?
@_date: 2014-02-05 20:22:18
With the current Lamassu machine this is not possible - It's more like a first come, first serve sort of exchange (see my comment below).
In the future it might be possible for people to include a message with their BTC transaction to the machine address stating their minimum price, and then there would be a cascading system in place that would first fill all the orders with the lowest sell price. When all these orders are filled, we could (in a perfect world) update the Lamassu's backend and adjust the price to the next lowest ask.
Like I said, this is all ideas we are having at the moment that are not _technically_ possible yet with the Lamassu, but in the future we would like to make the whole process from seller to buyer as painless and easy as possible :)
@_date: 2014-10-29 12:04:07
because the spot price is 10% above e.g. Krakens

It was on a seperate 'ticketing' system tey made at hash.gawminers.com where they ecplicitly stated to not use the classic ticket system. 
I don't care when their hashlets came out, i got an email from them the 1st of nov that they shut down my miners and that I had to choose between reimbursement or 'upgrading' after which I said reimburse me. No word from them since, also not on shipping. Just got the payout and they changed the numbers.

Oh wow. So an encrypted Qt waller on linux was hacked? I don't know that much about security, but how is this possible? Afaik the encryption of the wallet can't be brute forced right? So the only thing that I can think of is a keylogger then? But on Ubuntu?? This is a very scary thread, lol. I do find it a bit weird that you had coins on a machine that functions as a webserver to be honest.

A no brainer? You would have to buy AND spend BTC immediately to not be exposed to the volatility, and opening an exchange account (handing out pretty much all your personal information) + paying the transaction fees is not something that is worth a 2% discount to people.

I can't believe this sub is still spewing the same nonsense as it was years ago. Just because you were lucky enough to buy bitcoins before  the current levels, doesn't make you a 'strong hand'. 
How would you like to see an investment plummet 30 or 50 or 80%? I hang out on trading and forex subreddits too, and people who cut their losses aren't called weak hands. It's called risk management. 
You got lucky: you bought early, or you mined. If you are such a strong hand, what is your price average if I may ask?
Fuck your 'weak hand' talk. Bitcoin is amazing. It's wonderful. It's elegant. It's also a solution to a problem that doesn't exist, and no one gives a fuck about it. That's a very sad thing. 
@_date: 2015-04-15 01:03:12
The average person does not think these things in my opinion. They mostly don't see the need for a currency that changes value like the wind, is incredibly hard to store safely and it's uninsured. I can't blame them. I've accepted that people right now have no need for it and no interest in it. Personally, I like and sometimes still use bitcoin because it's really easy to pay for stuff online and I don't have to enter details or a password, I just need my phone. All the other libertarian, anti-government, be-the-master-of-your-money is nice and stuff, but I don't care about it. 
Imagine everyone used bitcoins with cybersecurity in its current state. It's unimaginable. Cold wallets for everyone? Wonderful! Make sure you roll some dice and have a raspberry pi or a linux image handy and don't forget to write down that Electrum seed. Mainstream adoption is not gonna happen anytime soon, if at all.
@_date: 2015-04-15 01:08:28
Ha - I'm not butthurt about the 'investment opportunity'. I'm butthurt about your attitude towards people that lost money. You're being arrogant because you got lucky. You found out about bitcoin early on, decided it was really interesting and bought/mined some and you turned a nice profit. That's great. 
It's easy to dismiss other people as weak hands. You think that looks good on you? It's arrogant. This is what is wrong with this community. The technology is great. The 'community' is toxic. Neckbeards tumbling over each other to say how nothing is wrong, the tech is still unchanged, and everyone selling is weak hands. 'Who else was there for the crash from $30 to $2 raise your hands!!!!'  
When will you sell your coins? Let me guess - "When you don't have to!"
What if bitcoin slowly declines to $100 and then to $50 and then to $10?  I'm not saying that will happen - but just imagine if it does. Will you be a strong-handed person then or will you just be a dumbass that missed out on having 2000% more money if he only sold a couple years before?

@_date: 2013-12-19 14:00:24
Can't belive you found this post on reddit! I have personally explained the concept op Bitcoin to all of my friends and most of my direct family. The direct consequence of a good explanation was, in most cases, that they were eager to buy at least _some_ BTC because it's such an exciting new technology. 
The idea of having a publicly maintained ledger containing every transaction in the world is a pretty exciting one, even for people that have a lot of difficulty understanding the technological aspects. I think that myself, and a lot of the other people that you contacted were pretty put off when you told them that "you were looking for someone to talk openly about the number of coins they have and when they bought them".
That's like looking for someone who invested in GOOG back in the day  and going to them for help, totally neglecting their expertise on the subject and flat out asking them how much money they OWN right now in the stock market. It just doesn't make any sense and sends out the wrong signal. 
Either way, it sounds like you are trying to make a decent documentary and I wish you the best. Digging around on this subreddit will give you a LOT of information on Bitcoin. Please don't try to stress the gains people made in the past. When you want to make a documentary on the implications that facebook has had on our daily lives, are you going to look for the angel investors who bought shares back in 2004? Or are you going to interview someone who is an expert on the subject?

He's doing an awful job. He's patronising them. Why the hell would you have to 'bait' someone in 'explaining' something 'on purpose'. You could also just inform yourself and then ask very basic, educated question that explain the concept of BTC perfectly. That's what a good reporter would do.

Are you being ridiculous? The market cap of Apple is 450 billion dollar, the market cap of bitcoin is only 6,5 billion dollars. If apple only had 1 share, the price of that 1 share would be 472,000,000,000 dollars. So the amount of shares matters.

I replied to his question with "Do you also go around asking people how much money they have in their bank account?" 
I was hoping I could be a nice asset to the documentary but since this is going to turn out into a big piece of sensationalism, "telefacts style", I'd rather not be.
Koppen kan ons misschien wat meer hulp bieden ;)

Haha, sorry about that - your enthusiasm was infectious and I had no idea that was you. Keep up the great work!
@_date: 2013-12-06 10:21:24
Definitely not normal, I've done this quite a few times during the last few months and it was always a painless transaction. I sure as hell hope nothing went wrong on their side because transactions with BTC are pretty un-fucking-reversible! 
edit: I created a topic to inform people about this issue - 
@_date: 2013-12-17 19:07:55
yeah, I think that's about the same number of people that I personally know that own BTC. Friends and family mostly whose interest was sparked because of my enthusiasm :)
@_date: 2013-12-06 12:18:47
I added the reply to my original post
@_date: 2013-12-06 13:12:49
great to hear :)
edit: Me too!

I made a topic warning people about this and suggesting they hold off on withdrawing BTC from Bitstamp. Please don't downvote for visibility:
@_date: 2013-11-12 14:12:48
Wow that interviewer just made me straight out angry. He's acting like a fucking twat that doesn't know anything and is proud about it because 'the bitcoins' are a fairy tale in his brain.
'WHO MAKES THE BITCOINS? THATS THE PART I REALLY DONT GET'. Are they supposed to not research _anything_ before doing an interview?

Also, this is the first night BTC actually kept me awake for so long. That climb from ¥6000 to ¥7000 was just mind boggling.

make sure you check your finances tab they don't convert to USD automatically

Ik ga proberen er bij te zijn, zal tussen 2 katers door zijn maar ken de persoon die het organiseert en denk dat het wel echt interessant kan zijn!
@_date: 2013-12-06 10:31:18
Yes I have the exact same issue. Tried withdrawing precisely one hour ago.
@_date: 2013-12-17 18:29:14
It seems that they asked pizza.be for a list of costumers that used Bitcoins as a payment. pizza.be contacted me to ask for my permission and I got a call from the documentary guy a few days later.

I can't even wire money to my friends in the same country in less than 24 hours unless they are with the same bank
@_date: 2013-12-03 10:32:54
cheers thanks. The reason I'm asking is because I deposited 5 BTC to Kraken and they usually fund after 6 confirmations. So far it's been 12 confirmations and nothing. Could the reason that we are finding almost double of the blocks/hour that the difficulty can't catch up fast enough with the increased hash rate?

You give gox your btcs/dollars. Then you play the exchange game and when you choose to cash out, they give you the right amount.

u mad
@_date: 2013-12-02 18:03:00
What _might_ happen? That's what bitpay is doing right now.
@_date: 2013-11-06 13:53:17
I love how 10k BTC used to buy you a pizza and now its .075. In my mind, BTC and pizza will forever be intertwined.
@_date: 2013-12-06 11:27:24
I'm sorry I don't quite understand what you are trying to say. I've done numerous withdrawals from Bitstamp without issues, and now my coins are somewhere in limbo between them and my address. 
I think it's only normal that I try to warn people, especially since I saw other threads popping up on reddit with the exact same issue.
