not everyone lives in countries where thats a option. and many places offer big discounts using BTC for purchases. pharmaceuticals in the grey market is a big one. i got some stuff to help a injury not long ago that i didnt want to goto a specialist and pay more than it would cost me to get it online myself. used btc for it, the fees were nothing compared to the 20% discount i got for paying in BTC. very common.

99.99% of people that spend bitcoin do so immediately after purchasing it.. thats how it is. they are not bitcoin people for the most part. 
to think bitcoin holders are retards for not using there btc when its at shitty prices... well. Go spend all your btc at starbucks or whatever. 
But those people buying btc and using it instantly can take my place and many others filling the void of btc being used for currency. It still very much is.

And im not even convinced it will crack 5500 yet.. The sell side is tiny.. All it will take is some relatively small buying to push back up to 7k. The whole thing looks like a mess to me since we went under 6500. Just manipulation pure and simple at this point. Anyone trying to do TA on BTC... i dont get how you think it can legitimately work in this situation
