I am brazilian. Is very hard for an average brazilian to invest outside the country. Almost impossible. The confidence in the government and politicians are in ATL right now.
I know many people going to Bitcoin as a mean to diversify and protect against real, the brazilian currency. 
There is a lot of getting rich quick scheme and thinking but I see this are going to altcoins. We know how it ends for most of them. 
The bitcoins hodlres are aiming more long term, and of course hoping to have their savings bigger in the long run. I would say most of bitcoin hodlres have the right mindset.

Bcash is crashing too. Nobody spends gold and it has value. This is result of this ridiculous civil war.

After a while you will start feeling that your bitcoin is the only real asset you have. Living in a country with a terrible currency like the brazilian real this is even more so.

No, they will never find my seed phrase. Your house , your fiat, all that can be taken away, your bitcoins only if you decide to.
