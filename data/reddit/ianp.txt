It's not taxable until it's realized.
If you buy BTC at $100 per BTC, then your basis is $100.
If you redeem that 1 BTC for $200 in something, then you have a taxable income of $100 (current value - basis.)

Thanks -- exactly what I was looking for.
So there's really no downside, right? I will essentially have two copies of the wallet in case of some sort of unplanned event.
Since I'm new to this -- how often do you export your wallet? After every transaction? Or does that not matter?

It won't be half. At the next retarget, difficulty is expected to rise ~22%. So, we could expect 700 mh/s to produce 0.1248 per week.

Are they 67117?

As it would happen, I'm a software engineer by trade (and at my day job.)
I'm sure I could implement most of what you've mentioned, but my concern is that something wouldn't go as planned and I'd have my employees calling non-stop if this were to gain traction.
A couple of my concerns:
  * "I have .21 BTC, and I want to pay the rest in cash."
  * "Can I pay you .5 BTC and get in cash back?"
Most of those are purely procedural/operational issues that can be taught to the employees, but I'm worried it will come up often.
As for taxes -- I'm with you. I don't even know how to track it. I'd probably have to have some sort of system that tracks the current exchange rate, and what percentage of the transaction represents tax.
And I don't even know the legalities or how to charge tax on a bitcoin transaction.
So many things to consider!
@_date: 2013-06-18 18:58:40
Yes. You can just run the math I posted at any time, and you should get a factor that can be multiplied against the current difficulty to get an estimate.

While difficulty and hashrate are two different things, there is a correlation in the product of the two.
Difficulty, along with hashrate, determine the amount of coins you will find.
The last increase was ~24%. Therefore, the hashrate prior to the increase would produce 24% more coins than the hashrate afterward. This still does not account for the drop in coins mined, though.
There has been a drastic drop over the past 48 hours:

Quick question (I'm still a bitcoin noob,) but what does "Confirmed" mean?
I bought some bitcoins from someone in-person today, and I got a notification on the app on my phone and assumed it was good. It took ~20 minutes to go from "Unconfirmed" to  "Confirmed".
Is it possible that you won't actually receive the bitcoins if they are still unconfirmed?

Found them on bitcoin local -- and then I did some internet detectiving, and found them to be trustworthy.
I was able to find out a good bit of information on the person prior to making the transaction (i.e., where he works, etc.) so I was okay with everything. 
Turns out he was a nice kid -- and we got along really well. I've sent him additional business since then.
Hope this helps! If you have other questions, feel free to ask.
@_date: 2013-10-20 03:10:50
No. Well, I suppose there could be an indirect relation, but I would argue that the price is more closely related to the supply (reserves) that remain to be mined. 
Reserves would be the same if we were at 3 ph/s or 50 gh/s.

Difficulty is what regulates how quickly miners can find new blocks.
The lower the difficulty, the less hashing power required to mine a block. Conversely, the greater the difficulty, the more mining power it will take to find a new block. The system is designed to self regulate at 1 block every 10 minutes. 
After 2016 blocks have been generated (this is called the target or target block,) the system automatically adjusts the difficulty (higher if the average time to mine a block is less than 10 minutes over the last 2016 blocks, lower if it's more than 10 minutes over the last 2016 blocks) to ensure that blocks are mined at the intended rate.
The meaning of difficulty is exactly what it sounds like, how difficult it is to find a new block. Specifically, it means how much hashing power is required for a supplied difficulty to find one new block every 10 minuets.
Each successive block mined has a block number associated it with, and that number is the number of the previously found block incremented by 1. The target block is the block number of the last difficulty change + 2016.
It is rather complex, and confusing, but reading [this]( will help with understanding.
Hope that sheds some light on the subject.
@_date: 2013-04-24 18:37:34
Can you do:
Thank you!
@_date: 2013-10-20 02:58:21
No. Why would it? Hashrate is affected by difficulty, so a block is still found every ~10 minutes.

I guess I wasn't clear in the OP -- I don't need the money. I considered it lost when I bought it.
I'm asking what others would do -- buy more or wait it out.
I'm familiar with markets and have been successful in the past. I have not done anything with bitcoins prior to this week -- so I was curious as to what others are doing, and am interested to see if they are following the same strategy as those of us who are heavily invested in the stock market follow.

Here's some info.. I'm a bit over your BTC cap, but I'll give you some info anyway.
I started with BTC several years ago by mining on my PC. Just casual stuff. I managed to get about 1 BTC or so doing that.
I bought a large amount at about $250 per BTC. I bought them hoping to help with the adoption of bitcoin by buying some stuff I wanted with bitcoin (gold/silver bullion.) I am also interested in figuring out a simple way to take them as payment at my sports bar.
I still have all of the bitcoin -- never spent them. I plan to hold on to them until I see something I can't live without.
I bought them in-person from someone local, with cash.

Looks like mining dividends are at 0.01814 currently. I expect that it will be 0.02 from mining. Add into that whatever sales they've had. I expect 0.025+ dividend, and would not be surprised if I saw another 0.35+ dividend tomorrow.
With that said -- I expect them to withhold dividends for future growth soon. I do not know when, but I expect it to happen in the near future.

Well, I wouldn't touch litecoins.
Bitcoins would be inherently safer than ASICM on Havelock. 
BTC is not directly related to the price of ASICM, and ASICM could be proven to be a great investment (or complete fraud,) and it would not affect BTC at all.
If you're looking to invest, go ASICM. If you just want BTC, but it and hold it.

A retarget happens every 2016 blocks.
The time between blocks is designed to be regulated (by difficulty) at one per 10 minutes. That means that 2016 blocks should take exactly 14 days to find.
To determine the estimated difficulty increase, you can infer the increase by determining if we're on track or not for a 2 week retarget.
For example, the last retarget was block 241919 (this happened Sunday,) and the next retarget is 243935.
Since Sunday (2013-06-16 21:33:27) we have generated 276 blocks (2013-06-18 18:23:15). This works out to 276 blocks over ~45 hours. 
Since difficulty is designed to regulate blocks at 1 every 10 minutes, we know that, at the current difficulty, there should have been 270 (45 hours since last retarget * 6 blocks per hour) blocks generated. 
Some simple math leads us to the conclusion that 1-(270/276) = 0.0217, or 2.17%.
The current assumption is the difficulty will be 19,758,920.17689747. (This is calculated by multiplying the current difficulty times the amount calculated above.)
Good luck.

@_date: 2013-06-14 19:10:23
Thanks for the reply!
My thoughts on the arguments against ASICMINER are that they (the arguments) are incredibly short sighted.
In November, the network will be at ~2.22 ph/s. ASICMINER is poised to maintain ~20-25% of the hashrate at that time, while continuing to generate ~$1.5m USD per month  (at today's BTC-&gt;USD rate) in revenue to cover operating costs and R&amp;D.
I feel confident that they will release the first Gen 2 chips for public consumption in October, and they will probably begin testing them in their devices early September. I do not have the same level of confidence in the other providers.
With that said, confidence is gained by producing, and the others have yet to produce *much*. I concede that they could, but I just do not have the confidence that they *will*.
As for hardware sales, the sales are currently producing over half of the dividends each week. That's a good amount. You &amp; I would both agree that selling pick axes during the gold rush was more profitable than mining the gold itself :)

An offline wallet is a bit much for me right now, but I'm sure in the future I'll probably try something like that.

Second havelock.
I've had good luck with them recently.

The key is going to see how the perform after the next retarget (which is in three or so hours.)
They were able to increase hashing power at the last retarget almost instantly. I'm curious to see if they can do it again.
I am unsure of what the blips over the past day have been, with regards to hashrate.  Current 2 hour hashrate is &lt; 20 th/s. They had a 4 hour period where they hit ~15 th/s sometime yesterday as well.

As a hobbyist miner (protect the network, etc.) this was my thought as well.
They do have twice the power consumption though.

I agree. I've seen similar articles posted lately, and the responses are "NO WAI U CANT TAX MY BITCOINS LOLLL" or something to that effect.
The reality is that tax is simple, and every form of income is taxable in the US.
If you bought 100 BTC for $10 USD/ea, and sold 100 BTC for $100 USD/ea, then you're required to report $10,000 (100 * $100) - $1,000 ($100 * 10), or $9,000 in income.

Now you know what a bitcoin panic *sounds* like as well.
@_date: 2013-06-14 19:06:00
I believe so, but I am uncertain (and don't have the time to research it at the moment.)
@_date: 2013-05-19 14:22:08
Can I have some bitcoins? Thanks.
@_date: 2013-05-21 15:35:37
I'm not entirely sure what the risk in going over 50% of the hashing power is.
Could they easily dupe transactions? Make up their own? 
If they've distributed their total hashing power throughout pools, would this eliminate their ability to screw with the chain?

I have no idea what you said, but upvote for passive aggressive entrepreneurship.

I'm aware of the quote as I worked with TAT, VJain and frank to put the questions together and submit them.
I have a strong hunch that the response contains a bit of posturing, however.

Google offers this exact thing when logging into their services. Works well for me.

Keep in mind that difficulty can go down.
That strategy may work for a week or two, but it will catch up with you eventually.

What is his budget?

Several of us over at have an interest in BTC.
I'll sub and post some pics.

If energy costs are a concern at $0.07/kWh, then I suspect building a solar array big enough to support the mining workstation would cost far more than it would generate.
Just my two cents.. er.. bitcoins..

They're not bad.
I'm an avid bullion buyer, and their prices seem reasonable at this time.
@_date: 2013-05-21 13:20:36
I don't follow your logic.
Even at a 20% yield -- it is a great deal. They can yield 20% on dividends alone at the current price. I see no reason why they cannot continue to produce these kind of returns going forward, especially since nobody has decided to challenge them.
@_date: 2013-04-07 22:48:05
Is it just a matter of preference between the two? In other words -- do they both have mostly positive reviews and a strong user base?
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:37:59
That's awesome, good for him. Looks like taking a risk in the early days has paid off, and he's paying it forward.
I'm kicking myself for not dropping a $2,000 into the system years ago. 
Ah well, such is life.

(Possibly stupid) Question -- What is stopping ASICMiner from taking 20% of the network hashrate through BTC Guild, 20% through BitMiner and another 20% from solo mining?
@_date: 2013-11-05 13:34:25
Interesting, thanks.
@_date: 2013-06-17 12:16:59
My point was that if everyone stopped mining to buy BTC, difficulty may go down. That's all I was saying. I'm not saying it will go down.
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:52:33
I'm assuming that everyone is in agreement that a small group of individuals (or investors) are attempting to manipulate the market.
Is this correct, or am I missing something?
@_date: 2013-05-01 13:47:50
That's my site used to attempt to figure out the various apis out there. Not much luck so far. I really just use it to check the current price.

Like what?
Blockchain is very easy to use, and if you're doing basic stuff... Why not?

A friend of mine is always asking for some "tylenol" when he comes over. I think he's taken some of my tramadol (I don't take it very often, maybe 1 pill a month for back problems.)
I wonder if he's been stealing it and selling it on the black market? How much do they go for? 
@_date: 2013-06-18 19:40:06
The likelihood of getting everyone to do this is as close to 0 as you're going to get :)
@_date: 2013-04-22 14:27:41
Am I doing anything stupid?
*  I use a bitcoin wallet on my Android phone for general spending/selling/buying bitcoins.
*  I transfer the bitcoins to my house once they're received and confirmed.
*  I have encrypted the wallet (at home) with a complicated, random generated password that I do not use elsewhere.
Is this relatively safe?

So I'm not really sure if this will help -- but I'm a long time redditor and don't have any negative rep associated with me.
Any who -- I own a restaurant (sports bar) about 15 miles away.
We are taking physical and cash donations (as of 5 PM yesterday.) There were no real drop points setup at that time, so we set one up at the restaurant.
We will be making regular deliveries to the designated drop off locations.
So, if you're local, and have anything physical, then I will happily take it and make sure it gets to those who need it most.
As a side note, I'm particularly interested in finding people with specific needs (i.e., 6 year old boy needs clothes/food/toys/etc.)
I have two children, both of them have more than they'll ever need (I.e., 3 nintendo DS) and I want to get them to a little boy or girl who need it. If anyone knows of anything, please pass it along.
I also have a verified mtgox account. I'm not sure how to get the money converted into hard goods (i.e., diapers, food, water, etc.) or USD. If anyone has a method to do this easily, then I will gladly take the BTC and convert them into whatever you all deem necessary at the time, and make sure it gets to those who need it.
