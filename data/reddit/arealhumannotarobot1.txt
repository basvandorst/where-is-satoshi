If you've got a better idea on how we can celebrate marginal increases in our magic internet money, I'd like to hear it... because I'm pretty sure the only thing we can control is whether or not we're posting gifs of the same cartoon bitcoin going either up or down. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go furiously masturbate to some of that sweet, sweet bitcoin coaster rule 34 pornography.

This is really exciting. I can not wait to leave Bitmain behind. They are an awful company.

This is a AAA grade shitpost. Well done.

This is the internet, damn it. You speculate wildly and get angry when someone disagrees with you! Never admit that you don't know something!

 DISAGREE WITH YOUR ASSESSMENT AND THEREFORE YOU'RE SOME SORT OF ASSHOLE.
@_date: 2017-07-20 13:46:01
Yes. See "internet commenting".

You shut your whore mouth when you're talking to me.
