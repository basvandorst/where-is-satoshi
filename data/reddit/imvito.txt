@_date: 2018-09-19 19:36:23
Yes, that's why we are resorting to things like btc, gotta say, buying a little bitcoin years ago literally saved my life paid for my operation and stuff
@_date: 2018-09-21 04:40:13
Yeah! This is very cool! Bitcoin will be huge and surely it's helping venezuela. Localbitcoins here is huge!!!!

@_date: 2018-09-25 03:38:35
This is so cool. It's says "Do you have bread?" (which is a question more common than you think) as a Venezuelan this reaches in a deeper level. btw. That's less than 1c USD. those used to be the lowest bills here in Venezuela but they have been change 2 times.
@_date: 2018-09-21 11:59:10

@_date: 2018-09-19 17:21:52

@_date: 2019-03-19 01:46:49
Localbitcoins! There are not that much people dealing with crypto but DASH has a growing number of merchants accepting it.
@_date: 2019-03-19 01:45:31
Most people used USD
@_date: 2019-03-19 01:45:55
Me referia a la red de bitcoin...
@_date: 2019-03-18 23:14:37
Most shops did operations mostly in USD, some didn't even wanted to accept VES
@_date: 2019-03-28 14:01:47
A friend of Mine is a Freelancer pixel art artiat and has been paid by PayPal I'm trying to convert him to use bitcoin for ease usability and a better exchange rate! The thing now is the power situation I just spent another day without power, I'm still looking for a job and willing to work for Crypto ;)

Some places had generators and phone lines were still up so WiFi  and internet where still up on some places, and there are project to have mesh to connect directly to Blockstream Satellite by twitter.com/BTCVen
@_date: 2018-10-25 16:22:14
How would that work? Seems interesting!
@_date: 2019-03-18 23:09:57
It really showed us how electricity dependent as a society we are, satellite internet and solar are too expensive for a day to day venezuelan, but more people are buying and taking care of Gas Generators!
@_date: 2019-03-19 00:55:15
well, Venezuela has a Level 4: Do not travel warning from the US...

In my City, (Valera, Trujillo) Communications were spotty af, most POS were down after day 2, I don't know what was the case in your city, I don't knew if Visa/Mastercard were up, I used BBVA and they weren't working. 
As you can see I didn't claim that people were using BTC to transact just that  the BTC network was UP and running.

Didn't make a video because I was a in a rush, they are not paying a fixed rate, I talked with a cashier and she told me that it was a rate that the company decides, for example yesterday it was 210 VES, when the black market rate is 270VES

@_date: 2018-11-16 14:48:16
They aren't using the government exchange rate, they use their own exchange rate very close to black market rate, for example I paid 1$ = 280 USD when Black market was 289usd so close enough,

@_date: 2017-09-28 16:12:47
Good ol venezuela, I conviced my dad to invest 60k VEF almost a year ago, now that it's worth 2KK aproximattely between the rise of bitcoin and the Bolivar being worth less than shit, that's pretty much our emergency funds. not much tbh a night on a hospital it's pretty much that

2. No
3. Gold Euro USD
4. To save or to use it to exchange for other currencies, example Ves to Btc to Eur, also ETH 
5. Not that I heard of
6. Local bitcoins let's you send for free between their wallets (2nd layer)
7. Don't. Unless you know someone to guide you

@_date: 2019-05-01 21:27:18
Yes it happened to me, I was bored with my dad the other day and we did some rough math on how much it would cost to buy the whole building with today's inflation... It came about less than $1
