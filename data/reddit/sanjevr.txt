maybe check it out. I edited OpenStreetMap many times and put venues there that never showed up on coinmap so it's possible that Satoshi Labs removed the fuctionality of coinmap taking data from OpenStreetMap, I haven't confirmed this though.

Very very very few pay in BTC. Only 4 customers at the deli paid in BTC.
At the time of this posting we haven’t had any patients at our office pay in BTC. Yet.

I used it in correct context. Of course I'm going to complain about directories being useless and shitty if their the ones showing up on Google search and on every bitcoin help website. If nobody uses or cares about them then why do they turn up the most when I look for anything bitcoin related?

Apparently they did because I tried that way but it never showed up on the map. I had to email the people behind CoinMap at Satoshi Labs because there was not even a trace of instruction on how to place a venue on Coinmap anywhere on the site.  Google and Reddit (up until my post) had outdated information.

I'm good but if anyone wants to use these ideas to make a good bitcoin directory go right ahead.

It should be decentralized and deregulated but that's not the issue. The issue is these directories suck, They are buggy and are poorly coded. They are difficult to navigate and they're run by mediocre service people.
On the Other hand I've never heard of OpenBazaar. What is that?
