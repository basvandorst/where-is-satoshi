No. I do not use my coinbase password for anywhere else. Maybe there is an Amazon database floating in the black market for when people need it? Or maybe my computer was compromised, and this coinbase stuff is a coincidence.
Hacker went through a VPN in Indiana.

I believe it:
Yesterday I posted this post:
I misplaced my password for that throwaway account, but I'm Bottom line is, hacker had my coinbase password and tried to log in as me. Got a message asking for Authy 2factor, along with the last 2 digits of my phone number.
Hacker goes to Amazon.com and logs in as me (WTF???) and asks customer support for the rest of my phone number.
I get an email from Amazon about the chat. Luckily, the hacker hung up on the chat support without saying goodbye, so they sent me an email to ask whether we had been prematurely disconnected.
I spoke with Amazon. They described the chat log. Attacker was asking for my phone number.
I checked my Coinbase logs. Yup, failed login happened less than an hour before the hacker contacted Amazon.
I ran malwarebytes on my computer. Nothing. Just re-installed Windows to be sure.
If Coinbase was hacked, that explains how they got that password.
The fact that they also were able to impersonate me on Amazon gives me chills.
Check your activity log on coinbase for failed login attempts. Change your password.
