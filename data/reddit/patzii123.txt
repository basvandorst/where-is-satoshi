...and my biggest mistake in life was to sell all of my bitcoins (xxx) at 400$ each. i'll regret it my whole life.
@_date: 2018-01-26 17:25:36
No, we don't need a individual coin for everything.

imagine moving 1 billion $... damn son. i would recheck the receiver address for like 2 hours again and again and again letter after letter
@_date: 2019-08-02 15:05:40
somebody got the screenshot of the prediction?
@_date: 2019-06-22 13:10:13
I absolutely love the thought that all newbies who bought in at the last bull run (who heard they can make a quick buck with this thing) and sold because of fear when it collapsed who probably afterwards said "fuck bitcoin fucking scam this thing is dead" now realize that they probably would'nt have made a big/any loss or even already made some gains now if they never sold back in 2017-2018. And now they realize that HODL would have been the key to success. Bitcoin isn't stupid, it was your failure of trying to make a quick $.
This thought is what really puts a smile in my face - they slowly realize they've made a big mistake by selling.
I hope this long-ass-sentence makes any sense, english is not my native language and also I absolutely suck at SPEAKING it.

mempool filling..
@_date: 2019-06-14 15:44:22
don't do it, too risky. what if the account is hacked?
@_date: 2019-06-22 17:59:23
Well, do some damn research on why bitcoin is not just a fad to make some quick bucks before you jump in with your money. That's why. You only panic sell if you have no idea what you are actually holding.  
Trust me, I've also made some HUGE mistakes before in the crypto-space - but I've learnt from it.
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:12:23
@_date: 2017-11-04 10:06:18
I always have one serious fear with those services.
What if the fiat buyer is buying the stuff with hacked funds or a hacked amazon account? Then I'll be most likely fucked without doing something wrong?
@_date: 2019-06-23 19:16:30
i see green, i get hard pp
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:58:44
lol, the last one got me
@_date: 2017-11-09 08:06:41
buy the next 2 dips 50/50
@_date: 2019-06-28 19:40:21
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:07:35
where can i see the number of stuck transactions?
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:59:32
can someone confirm its that simple?
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:34:04
yes, you most likely will still make some good profit.
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:34:11
i like your thinking !
@_date: 2019-06-25 07:30:22
what website is that?
@_date: 2019-04-24 19:14:35
@_date: 2019-04-02 21:17:55
Shit bull
@_date: 2019-04-03 21:14:27
so what IF... the one buyer who bought millions worth of bitcoin knows something that we dont know yet? hmm
...or he wanted to make some quick bucks. buy on low price - pump happens - sell high - profit

austrian here.
1 year+ of holding is necessary, right?

@_date: 2019-05-03 10:21:39
i dont think this will happen TODAY. and if so, just for a very short time.
@_date: 2019-05-15 18:59:02
i like green. especially green candles.
@_date: 2019-05-15 19:13:31
yes. im very worried about the mempool when shit really starts to blow up (again).
it was the same last bull run - the very slow transaction time was very very bad at this time and it was the  problem. but i think its a spam attack again. the last few days were no problem at all?
@_date: 2019-05-14 19:43:12
IT'S OVER (9000 soon)
@_date: 2019-05-27 16:32:38
