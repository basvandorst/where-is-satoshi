What in the fuck kind of shitty example is that? We are talking about someone putting their hands on someone else without a justifiable reason. That appears to be a public space, and even if it's not, those aren't uniformed officers. Put those hands on me and I would have put mine on him as well.

Not a scam at all. I have never experienced these problems and their customer support have been light years ahead quality wise compared to sites like coinbase.

The likelihood of there being any truth to you living in either North America or Europe with a family, a nice job, etc. and having zero transactions involving fiat in your life is laughable. Unless you only use bitcoins with business that only accept bitcoins and don't exchange bitcoins for fiat, then your words are worth less than nothing because the only difference between me using a xapo card and a business taking your bitcoins and converting them to fiat are basically nothing. 
In fact, I will go as far as saying that if you are purchasing anything in your life that has a price tag on it with a fiat currency displaying its value, then you're as much of an idiot as anyone else. The idea that the items you purchase online from amazon or where ever else that accepts bitcoins aren't converting your bitcoins into a fiat currency is hilarious. 
Once again, your comments are likely comprised of lies and are boring as fuck.

I've used the xapo card now for several online purchases from sites not accepting bitcoin as well as use it daily in stores for months. It's actually very convenient and i have been using bitcoin more then ever before because of the card.

I love this all or nothing mentality you have. These cards are allowing people to transition into using bitcoin for everyday purchases without limiting what they can buy. Not all of us live in their parents basement where we rarely venture outside. I would love to see what kind of life you have where you have eliminated the need for fiat. You must not drive a car, buy groceries, have utility bills, gonout for dinners, etc etc because unless you are blowing guys out back you are probably having to pay for those things with fiat. 
People like you are one of the things that hold bitcoin back from wide adoption by the general public. 
Reading your comments about "bitcoin or death" are boring and do nothing to help bitcoins adoption with new users who lead normal lives trying to transition out of fiat.

You're retarded. I literally have transitioned almost all of my transactions into using bitcoin with my xapo debit card. 
And I certainly hope there aren't more then you. You apparently can't comprehend English very well and avoid using logic or reason in your arguments. You ooze of btc elitism and it's boring and sad. Just follow the people like yourself and stop posting on here.

Out of curiosity, was there any reason why you were moving coins off your xapo account? I just started using their visa debit card.

How long does it take to transfer BTC back from your "offline" wallet to a wallet linked to a Xapo debit card? Would it be the same timeframe that you normally see from coinbase wallets to a xapo wallet? 
Sorry if it's a dumb question.

"He will not divide us!"
*crowd ignores the peaceful likeminded bystander being forced away*
Their words and message are meaningless when they won't even stop one of their own from being physically removed.

Thanks for your honesty man. Sorry to hear about you having these problems. Good luck!
