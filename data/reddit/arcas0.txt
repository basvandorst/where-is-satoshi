1) Lead time for silicon wafers
2) Shortage of RAM, GPUs use a lot of it
3) If crypto crashes, they will get double fucked: Overcapacity of production and high inventory along with used cards being dumped on the market, resulting in diminished retail sales.

You can flash the bios on cards.
Plus, purposefully nerfing your own products is a great way to get people to hate you. They'd be better off adding some special sauce to a mining series of cards (that they already have) and produce those.

Bitcoin isn't deflationary. The money supply has risen from zero to 14,000,000 in just a few years and isn't slowing down. Bitcoin is an example of a hyperinflating currency. This is the primary reason for the current price drop. The use base of Bitcoin stagnated, but buttons were still being mined.

I have done it before. It is pretty easy. 
You put your coins into the margin trading wallet, select the amount of bitcoins you want to short sell, and you can choose to close your position at any time. 
You can trade on margin if you are feeling a bit more risky, but high risk = high reward.

There are some programs such as GUIminer ( that are very simple to run if you already have bitcoin on your computer. Just run the program, tell it which cores and hardware to mine on, and sign up for a pool. A mining pool is a group of people that work together, and then when they get a payout, they split it between the members of the group based on how much they contributed.  and  are examples of popular pools that are trusted and known to pay on time with minimal fees, and they make it easy for beginners.
Last thing, don't expect to make much from mining unless you have some crazy expensive rig with triple 690's in it or something, I mined one time for a week with my old outdated graphics card, and I made something like .10 USD, not Bitcoins, but USD. I probably spent more on electricity than I made lol.

No, the reason the bubble started is that bitcoins rose from $30 to $60 because of speculation on the event in Cyprus. Mainstream media had a slow news day and reported that this small cryptocurrency doubled in a week, so everyone and their brother got greedy and wired their life savings to MtGox and waited for access to their funds. The price rose every day this week as the speculators gained access to their wired funds, so buying outpaced selling. After the small correction yesterday, prices leveled off around $160. When the speculators saw that the currency was leveling off, they decided they wanted their USD back and take their gains. This caused a small sell off, which grew larger as more and more people wanted to collect their winnings, or as it was before the market freeze, minimize their losses.

The price per coin is just what the last person was willing to pay. For some reason, someone in Canada didn't want to wait in line, so they offered more than the asking price and got their coins.
Bitcoins are worth whatever someone is willing to pay for them.
To answer your question, I don't think that it would be very easy to buy bitcoins in USD, transfer them to CAD, and sell them in a quick enough time to take advantage of the current prices. You can try, but that whole process, especially buying the coins, could take up to a week in the current coin shortage.

Friedcat distributed the shares a while back, and the only way to actually own shares is to buy from someone else who has direct shares and tell friedcat that you traded them.

The owner of the direct shares receives the dividends from friedcat and then distributes them to the owners of the Pass-through shares.

1) Price soaring has nothing to do with ASIC machines; The prices are being skyrocket by speculation.
2) It may still be profitable to GPU mine, as ASICs haven't been released fully; you can try to buy one, but they are in very short supply.
3) You can buy things like reddit gold, and companies are adding bitcoin support every day.
4) BTC and Slush's are well known pools, and the advantage of bigger is that you get more consistent payouts.
5) The hashes are used to verify each transaction to make sure that you can't duplicate coins and double spend them.
6) If you are looking for a good return on investment, you should do your research very carefully, as mining is becoming more and more of a business venture.
7) Depends who you ask. Some say very likely, some say not at all. This pattern is very suspicious and we should all watch what it does carefully, as the overeager could lose lots of money in a market correction.
8) The goal is to spread Bitcoins into mainstream usage where it can be used as an anonymous form of money transfer, as well as a storage medium of wealth.
9) The US Government has made signs that suggest it supports Bitcoin; although this may change in the future.
10) It is really that easy to trade Bitcoins. A wire transfer can take anywhere from a few hours to a few days, depending on how busy the company is.

@_date: 2013-11-19 03:22:36
Short answer: No
Long answer: Probably not; last time there was a large boom in speculation, there was no noticeable raise in price that could be traced to verification time.
Also, people please stop calling bitcoin an investment. It is awfully incorrect.

Yes, I understand. I guess you can never be completely sure that there isn't a keylogger on your computer right now waiting for you to create a key, but with that logic you might as well be afraid of a meteorite hitting your computer and breaking your hard drive. If you are absolutely afraid, reinstall windows and make the key.

If you have an IQ above 70, you should be able to understand it no problem.
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:23:39
It wouldn't really matter who you are selling the bitcoins too, but theoretically, someone with either lots of bitcoins, or lots of money, could use their funds to influence the market, such as dumping thousands upon thousands of coins, just to drop the floor under the market and buy back at the bottom price, but the funds required to do so would be in the 10's of thousands of coins, so not likely. Another fact, is that influencing a trade market with the intention of taking advantage of it is a very very severe crime, and you can go to prison for a very long time if you get caught.

Depends when you would get it. If you got it today, you would make around $600 per day just mining. If you received yours a year or two from now, I can't say. It might be worth it, but by then everyone else is going to have one, so I doubt it. 
Another thing to consider is that you would be letting BFL hold on to your money interest free for 2 years before you got your machine.

What if I told you that currently, bitcoin has no value and it is all speculation? Right now, there are only a few merchants that accept bitcoin, and they just convert to USD right after receiving them, so the only reason bitcoins have any value is people think they will be more valuable in the future. All the speculators that came in droves this past week have no interest in keeping their bitcoins to spend, and they all want their money back.

It will last until the media stops reporting on how it quintupled in 7 days and every speculator and their brother stops dumping tons and tons of money into the market trying to get their share of the gravy train. Once the speculators realize that, since they have no interest of buying normal products in bitcoin, they want their USD back, there will be a large selloff and the price will correct.

Many people are afraid of using paypal to trade bitcoins because the buyer has the ability to reverse the transaction, where bitcoins sent are permanent.

Step 1) Go to  and download their bitcoin client
Step 2) Run the program and wait for the block-chain to download. (May take a few hours). The block-chain is a recorded history of every transaction ever, and you need it to be able to use bitcoins.
Step 3) Your client will give you a public code and a private code. There is a difference between your public address code, and your private code.
Public Address Code (example: 17rgjPmpGzwSteGVatwv7eAMH7u6akzjsk) This is like a mailbox for your bitcoins. You can feel safe giving this code to anyone and everyone, because the most they could do with it is send you free money. You can never take coins from someone's account with just their public address code.
Private Code (example: 5J2ABMYjLCUrEmYDT98RPqbsQ72B4CtwnAU2FqqTBAdkcXE5Wr2) Never ever under any circumstances give this code to anyone ever. This is your bank pin, account number, and routing number all in one. No website will ever ask for this, and if they do, never give it to them because they will just take your money instantly.
Step 4) A smart thing to do would be to create a paper copy of your private code and store it somewhere safe such as a fireproof safe. 
Currently, there are more and more companies starting to accept bitcoin as payment, and it will only grow. You can get your hands on some bitcoins by buying them at a bitcoin exchange such as mtgox.com.

something might have been messed up in your wallet program's options. Most of them have an option to change it. I am assuming that you are transferring more that a few nano-bitcoins, because in which case, the transfer fee could very well be higher than your transaction.

If you want to be sure, you can open the task manager on your computer, assuming Windows, to check if it is downloading. The block-chain is around 6gb, so it might take a while. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 02:37:52
If you decide to buy bitcoins now, I would recommend a very trusted exchange like Mt.Gox for your first time. 
If you are looking to buy as a short-term investment, I would recommend waiting until this current price bubble has smoothed out. Buying as a long-term investment or for actually spending them, diversification is key. Some people on this subreddit are investing their life savings into bitcoin, but let me emphasize that this is extremely risky and is the equivalent of putting all your eggs in one basket.

Bitcoin is inherently flawed. 57% of all bitcoins that will ever exist are already in circulation, in the hands of a few lucky nerds (aka .0001% of the earth's population). This is why bitcoin will never become that valuable; because so much of the wealth has been unfairly hoarded by a few.
