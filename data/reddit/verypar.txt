It's not pretend money. It's magic internet money.

That's why Bitcoin is gold, not iron.

If this became a criminal investigation, would that make it a valid exception to the principle of privacy, by libertarian views?

I used to get them several times a month. Now, a couple times a year. How often do you get them?

I guess the banks don't like me very much right now.

Ideally, there would be no newbies, only people who already know everything. But there have to be newbies if you want more experienced people. I was just wanting to save a new person some confusion/hassle by explicitly pointing it out.

Sounds like what happened with gold commodities in the beginning of last year.

Would you consider it anti-libertarian to conduct an investigation, given the suspicious nature of it?

To people reading this thread who are thinking of switching from Coinbase to gdax: While gdax is cheaper and easier, gdax and Coinbase are run by the same company, so legal/ethical problems with one will likely apply to the other.
This sums it up: 
Edit: Ok, maybe gdax isn't easier for just starting, but tbh, it's not really any harder, and it's more complete

You could always compromise and get a safety deposit box. Banks aren't even supposed to know what you put in those.

Yeah, I guess my comment implied it is simple. When I first heard of bitcoin, the explanation I was given made it sound like it was exclusively hashing, and I couldn't figure out how it could work without asymmetric encryption, or how mining could make your stored currency more secure if it did have private keys. I've been a bit frustrated by the fact that 99.9% of the explanations either require a deep understanding of cryptography, or are super basic and just about how USING IT works. I've been trying to find explanations that describe it in terms that normal IT people or app developers can understand, because I understand or can learn the different TYPES of cryptography just fine; it's how they are combined to solve the problems blockchains address that I find interesting.

Thanks for clarifying. So then the cryptography is much simpler than I thought; I'm taking it that it's basically just public key cryptography that protects your coins from theft, and all the hashing is basically just to create and verify them to protect everyone else from fraud.

Great, just what I was looking for! Thanks!
