We just released a early cut of the Bitdango Client. This contains limited functionality, you can only get balances and transaction history on a small group of exchanges currently. We are looking for early adopters to help test the client and provide feedback, feature requests, etc.

The current price (at this time) is about $207, but it's higher on the more popular exchange, its like $214 on coinbase for example.

About an hour ago I used the "instant buy" for 4 coins, and it is now "Pending" saying "Your bitcoin will arrive by Monday Nov 18, 2013." - so instant is not really instant like they claim.

Ah, I didn't hear about Baidu. When they started accepting the coin it ran up the price a couple weeks ago, if I remember correctly. So I guess we are seeing the reverse here?

Yep that looks about right for Chinese Yuan:

The link above shows markets that trade BTC as the base currency, which results in 72 markets. You can also search for markets with BTC as the quote currency, which will add 32 more: 
Lots of BTC markets out there.

It's not very clear from the post, but there are actually two queries to run; one gets all markets that trade with BTC as the base currency and the second gets all markets that trade with BTC as the quote currency. Also, if you look close you'll notice they are not duplicates, if you agree that a "market" is the combination of an exchange and a currency pair (base / quote). Have a second look at the two queries and then add the results together, I think you'll find it's like 103.
This one yields 72 markets: 
This one yields 31 markets: 
Total = 103
Notice the subtle different is the "baseCurrencies" vs "quoteCurrencies" URL parameter, which changes the search.

Anyone think we are looking at a DDOS attack? Possibly hackers trying to stop buys, so price falls, they scoop up more at lower prices???
