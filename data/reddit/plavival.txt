Nay sir. But thank you for the valuable suggestion, I've turned it on it for future spends.

Thanks! Any way to do this in the Samurai wallet?
@_date: 2019-06-28 13:49:11
Yup figured as much. I'm syncing bitcoin core and I'll restore the samurai wallet into it. Somehow. Hopefully.

But really, who doesn't?
We're the ones who might turn out to be dicks though, but we'll be dicks in Lambos! Amirite?

$2-3 in raw material and metallic paint.
It's the first iteration, I feel the ₿ needs to be extruded a bit more, but I don't want to ruin the old-timey minted coin kind of look :)

It's actually not that complicated, and I would gladly opensource the code.
Thing is, it's tied to other services, rarely anybody blasts realtime updates without some sort of penalty (GDAX' API is no exception), I sort of bypass this by multicasting and keeping the strain on their system as low as possible, well below the imposed rate limitations.
I'll think about making a youtube "howto" when I have some time :)
I might even be persuaded into making/shipping a custom build, hehe.

~~That's all super cool and all, and Lightning is awesome, but all of this is tied to their API right? So if that URL goes poof one day all of these LApps break?~~
~~Sort of like JS CDNs. Super convenient until one goes down and takes half the web with it. It happened before.~~
EDIT: You do need run a [full node as well]( for these to work, my bad!

Let me know the color you want in a PM, I'll get back to you asking for more details (like the address you'd like encoded on the NFC chip).
Completely free, of course, shipping included. Quantity limited to what you see above :)

(Still needs power though :)
Price is BTC/EUR, it's connected to my GDAX trade bot and it occasionally displays what it's thinking, purchases and sales.
*^(edit: Sorry for the scare if you're trading in USD!)

It has my wallet address on it, for requesting payments. Same functionality as a QR code just more elegant and reliable!
@_date: 2018-03-02 11:29:03
Absolutely, the NFC chip used can hold enough data. This + a RFID blocking sleeve is a very reliable method of storing your wallet backups, much more so than paper.

Hey, that's clever, thanks! I'm actually printing in PLA so acetone smoothing is out of the question, it's smooth because of the multiple coats of (very expensive) paint, hehe.
@_date: 2018-03-02 10:35:22
Let me know if you want one made :)
Edit: I'll refine it a bit, print a couple of variations and then give them away with your address included on the chip. Stay tuned!
