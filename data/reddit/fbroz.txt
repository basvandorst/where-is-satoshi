One other thought on this, just to play devils advocate and because I think bitcoin is so interesting:
I realize that almost everyone has to pay a decent fee to buy their bitcoin in the first place, so that cost should be factored in to what retailers charge.
BUT for me, as a bitcoin spender, that initial fee doesn't really exist.  I will hopefully get bc as payment for products, and soon I will hopefully be able to pay my suppliers with it. I am the outlier now, but in the future this might be the norm, and the fee to buy bitcoin might be nonexistent.
Alternatively, if I immediately transfer the bitcoin that comes in to dollars, I do pay coinbase a fee, so it's not a huge win for me over credit cards or paypal. 
I hope you don't feel like I'm badgering you, these are interesting questions to me.

I completely understand, notebooks are so heavy that shipping costs can be really high for us.  Thanks for looking at my store though!

We don't have a Bitcoin discount at this point, I would potentially consider doing that.  
To be honest, I added bc as a option because I think it is a better method of transferring funds and I wanted to be a part of it.  I know there aren't that many people out there who are using bitcoin as their main currency, but for those who are, the lack of retailers who accept it might be pretty annoying.

Wow, thanks for the order!  I will look into what happened there with the error message.  Like I said, I haven't had any bc orders yet, so I'm not sure exactly what the flow looks like.
EDIT: Could you tell if the error page was on tokyopenshop.com or the coinbase page?

I see where you're coming from on this.  I haven't done much shopping as a bitcoin spender yet, so this is insightful. 
One possible answer: Suppose you are holding your currency in bitcoin and you decide you want to use that currency to buy a fancy pen.  Your option before might have been to transfer that bitcoin to dollars (paying a fee) then spend it on my website.  Now you can spend your bitcoin without incurring that fee.  
I realize this might not be common now, but what if you got your paycheck in bitcoin in the future?

Thanks, I really appreciate the community feedback on this.  My wife and I discussed this quite a bit before setting it up, and we are both interested to see how it plays out.

These are our first bitcoin sales, so we will have to decide that.  Coinbase does strongly suggest to us that we convert each order as it comes in as a retailer.  They are presenting this service as more of a transfer than a speculative thing.

I agree, some cost savings are more visible to the customer than others. I definitely don't want any customers feeling like their are getting an unfair deal on payment.
I think for me, I would rather wait and see if bitcoin actually does save my money before incentivizing it too drastically.

I still need to add a badge or some other artwork to the bitcoin option at checkout, it looks pretty plain compared to credit card and paypal at this point.

Thanks!
