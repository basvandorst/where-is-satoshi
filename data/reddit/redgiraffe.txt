I've got the deoderant.  One of the best hippy deoderant's I've found.  
It's made from natural oils, so it sticks to your body a lot better than some other doederants whose smell disappears within a few hours.  
The lemongrass smell is pretty hardcore.  Hardcore enough to fight off my underarm stink-ninjas.  I'll give it five stars.  It fought my stink from the valleys of Endor all the way to Katmandu.  No longer does the shadow stink remain.

What do you remember most from your experience of your first company failing?  Or what do you now find most intriguing in retrospect?

It'd be great if someone copied it all to the blockchain. 
Would that be bloat or free speech?

I am confused about privacy on the blockchain. I would love some help here. Please correct me where I am wrong. 
Lets say that I am own a firm selling only product for bitcoin. I want to create a new public address for each sale that I make. This is so that my competitors cannot buy one of my widgets (or just find the public address on my website) and then see exactly how many sales I have had, for how much, and when.  
Furthermore, if I paid my suppliers in BTC, my competitors might be able to see how much I pay my suppliers every month. 
If I use a new public address for each sale, I obfuscate my earnings from competitors,  but as soon as I spend those coins, can't everyone see that they're tied to the same wallet?   Do stealth addresses do anything to solve this problem or is this not a problem at all?  This seems especially problematic if I periodically sweep a bunch of coins to cold wallets for security or other reasons.

Yeah but then it's not actually in the blockchain, it's just there on blockchain.info's web site.. 
@_date: 2014-10-22 17:02:49
Whoa. Does anyone have an explain it like I am at work and don't have enough time to skim 25 pages?
@_date: 2014-09-15 15:01:47
Hmm. 
Read that. Interesting but still.. 
Sounds great but wouldn't it cost more in transaction fees? 
If it did not, then, correct me if I am wrong, one might be able to see all the mini transactions together on the blockchain under one transaction and at least infer their origin, right?
If not, wouldn't it make transactions smaller and smaller (to the lowest transaction denomination) because, I assume, everyone wants the best privacy they can afford?  Might that bloat, or even spam, the block chain if every transaction were like that?

Amazing service.

Just made the switch to android.  
Are there any bitcoin payment systems for android apps at all or does everyone just get them for free these days?

Im confused on random number generation (when creating private keys). Are all computers/iPhones/droids hooked up with internal hardware used to generate random numbers or do some rely solely on software?

Anyone have an audio only version mirror somewhere?  Phone bills and high data...

Any new news on tree chains?  Is anyone working on that direction?
Listened to LTB on it but it's still a bit confusing. A gentle breakdown would be helpful as well since I'm a moron on Mondays.

Did mine without a hitch. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 11:39:42
Super interesting. 
If you've got any more links or info on this area, I would love to see it. Seems to me that unless this problem can be solved, mixers would be am important part of any healthy ecosystem. Maybe off blockchain transactions would obfuscate a company's ttransactions enough. Imagine though, being able to see a company's transactions before their quarterly earnings came out. In that world, it wouldn't only be a competing firm that would want that knowledge.  People in the finance industry, irs, jealous lovers, and many more would be interested in it.

This can be solved with Ring Signatures.

Seems like the discount only works through reddit.  Good trick.

Any alternative audio source?  Doesn't work on my phone.

What amazes me is that the fines always seem to go to the wrong people. With billions of dollars of funds, why not feed the entire country of Sudan for a decade or train a fleet of doctors to help their wounded for a generation to come?

They don't. 
Coinbase is just trying to make buying, selling, and using bitcoin easy. 
@_date: 2015-01-01 08:12:39
As long as you don't have a lot of bitcoin, your security doesn't have to be through the roof.  If you want a wallet on your desktop, you can use the chrome-integrated kryptokit.  It is an add-on that finds qr codes on the web page you're on so that you can easily buy things with bitcoin.  
If you're looking for something more security-minded and you're going to hold onto the bitcoin for a long time without the intention of spending it, go with armory or paper wallet.

Not sure, really, but that's damned impressive, making it all the way across that road without fiat.  
@_date: 2015-03-17 18:33:33
How'd the bitcoin cross the road?

Are there ideas to peg side-chains to assets and what would it look like (ie a side-chain where 1 side-chain-coin = 1$)?

Hey maybe you all are at the Madison Grill?  
We're eloping to Portland next month and want to spend some bitcoins.  Any cool places you all know of that aren't on coinmap (or are amazing and need to be visited)?
@_date: 2013-10-28 00:39:45
I've been trying.  
It's hard to convince them because:
1)Most of them accept only cash payments or have the vast majority of their transactions using cash.  That's a biggie.  
2)They don't want to spend more time on the internet/with computers than they all ready do.  Farmers are very busy with... farming.  
3)They see it as a very risky investment.  Lots of risk and effort for no necessarily realizable gain.  
4)They need to be spoonfed.  BTC is hard to get one's head around at first.  
@_date: 2013-10-18 17:57:26
Thanks we'll check it out.  See you soon Portland.

btc-e supports metatrader.  Windows only but I got it working on Wine and also works on iphone.  
There are demo accounts too.  It's always fun to play with monopoly money.

I doubt that FB will do this, if only because their CEO paid out the Winklevoss twins millions of dollars for (not sure of the legal term..) "copying" the entire idea (and probably code) of FB from them.  Correct me if I'm wrong.
The Winklevoss twins have tons of money invested in bitcoin.  It would be a huge bone to throw the twins if FB did this.  With so much bad blood alone, it seems unlikely.

Love moronic Mondays. 
Anyone have a good explanation or link to somewhere that explains how transactions can occur off the chain?  I missed that lesson.
