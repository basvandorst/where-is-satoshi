In your Coinbase account go to "settings" on the bottom left side. Then across the top of the page toward the right should be "API." Click into that and if you haven't already generated an API key click the button on the top right that says "+ New API Key."
Once it's generated you a key, click it to edit the permissions, you'll have to enter your password or authenticate again, and set it up how you'd like, I think for Mint you only need to enable "Balance" and from there you should be able to see your API secret as well. Copy and paste those into Mint and you should be good to go.

Maybe this has been answered elsewhere and I just can't find it. Hope someone can shed some light.
I have been mining altcoins on Multipool for the last couple months with my video card whenever I happen to be at my computer with Cudaminer, just for grins. I have them payout directly to Cryptsy and traded for BTC automatically. Obviously this doesn't add up to much, like .01BTC a month but now and then I've left my miner running all day and I could have 5-6 miniscule trades happen. At this point I've probably got a hundred trades of 1000 TIPS here, 500 DOGE there in my trade history.
With this IRS stuff have I made a potential nightmare for myself of trying to add up what the exchange rate was for every trade I've made and how much every uBTC was worth when I traded for it? Or, as I suspect, would the amounts I'm dealing with be way too small to even worry about reporting?

If that's truly the case, I can deal with it. Just let the BTC pile up on the exchange and cash them out to my personal wallet every couple months or something.Keeping track of 6 BTC payouts or so a year is a piece of cake. Doing the math on 500 little transactions of 15 different altcoins at 1-1000 coins a trade is not nearly worth the trouble for the .05 BTC I might end up with at the end of the year.

While the options are not what they are on Android obviously as far as wallet apps and shit goes, the windows phone platform does not seem to be as adverse to the concept of crypto currency as Apple. All the folks smashing their iPhones might want to look at a Nokia Lumia if their not into Android.

So, the only thing you can think of in defense of the protocol or to explain what happened is "LOL, Magic the Gathering"?
I mean, Nokia stated out making rubber boots or something right? Were they destined to fail at doing anything else? The whole magic card thing is kind of funny, granted, but as a way of explaining the situation to an outsider...kind of weak.

I don't understand why the poor guy cant wait for the market to turn around too. Is it implied that he has invested money that he actually needs to pay his bills or something? 
This reads more like a warning about stupid investment strategies.

This was more or less me. Bought my first little bit in January 2014 at ~$850 and a little more once a week for the next 2 years as the price kept sliding and just sat on it. Not because I had any insight or wisdom, just crossed my fingers never bought more than I could afford to lose at any one time and hoped.
