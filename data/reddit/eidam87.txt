Hey man this is a quick paint job you can go to Traiding view and see it from the pros. We can come here in a couple of days and we can see - maybe you are correct. Im just trying to let people know that there IS a healthy pullback with a bounce back to the moon, just for them not to be panic selling. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:16:29
5500 here we come, called it.
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:57:50
At 7900 we were at 84 RSI , now at 6574 we are at 70 RSI , I love Bitcoin, but we need a heathly pulback down. I have my buy around 4800 - that mightbe the oversold panic dip. Dont get me wrong. We WILL be bac at 6000 soon and healthy 7000 on new years. But this now is just hype - I dont care about shitposting act but I dont want a lot of people loose a lot of money in panic selling.
@_date: 2017-11-14 12:19:27
Agree make it 4800 
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:10:51
Relative Strenght Index 80+ overbought and bounce 20 oversold bounce
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:14:35
Down to 5000 panic sell incoming

So let me get this, if anyone shouts hold and gg holders and hold meme - thus giving advice to people not to take profit and making a piramid style all hold system. That is ok. Are all the hold shouters going to ask for permition from the comunity to sell??? And when someone is giving a humble opinion on a wayyy overbought price retractment he is a retard?

Man can your read - I wrote - Healthy pullback to 5K. No dooms day.

@_date: 2017-11-13 17:56:38
We are on a all year rise. This 5k will be just a pull back, from there we will continue up... business as usual. Just sell now or wait untill the price comes back up.

@_date: 2017-11-30 17:01:14
Man first you are not adresing the holders issue here are you one? This is not for the ego reddit rant - I am a regular dude with a family and kids. Just posting my opinion on the internet. And the only reaction I can  get here I guess is bunch of militant holders being pissed just because the numbers sound too pesimistic?? I I didnt just suck out the numbers. Look at the chart and zoom out - we are around 65  on the daily rsi. And we fell just to 9200. + the last correction was at 3100. So the 5500 sounds a bit too optimistic. And if I am wrong, so what...
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:46:06
yeah sortof forget to crop that from the exiting news....yeah..blame me
