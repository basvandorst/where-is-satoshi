north korea is a prison state, as acknowledged by the whole planet. venesuala is a socialist shit hole where people dont have to starve, but they do regardless thanks to being largly unable to even go get food from neighboring countries. Iran is being ruled by a facist theological islamist regieme, or maybe you should tell the citizens who would like their freedom back that "u.s. brainwashed media" is wrong about their state of affairs and things for them arent really
that bad.
I dont like bankers or debt slavery either, but that doesnt change the fact that america was founded on the idea of individual liberty, the basis of which has allowed it to become the most free country on the face of the earth, despite the subjugation efforts of the (((globalists)))

this earns "delusional comment of the day".
have you heard of north korea? how about venesuala? iran? cambodia? how about any majority muslim rule, sharia law country where women are legit property of the men in their lives?
