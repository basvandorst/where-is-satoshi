it's bitcoin, it's bitcoin cash, so what is it now? if it's so much better than bitcoin, as claimed, does it matter what you call it? Idiot is only riding the bitcoin "brand" because he knows it's a useless fork any other crypto can overtake if it wasn't for the name.

This, but you also need to have a solid team. If you are going to fork a project, you have proven nothing other than that you can copy someone else's code. Maintaining and actually improving it is what's important.

That's just a very narrow viewpoint. Everyone thinks "their end" is the right one. So if you just believe enough in your end, you can justify anything.

(1) fees were introduced to deter spam transactions, they never had anything to do with compensating miners
(2) at that point the reward is sustaining the network they are highly invested in. But this won't happen until around 2140 iirc. I don't think it will matter by then as technology will keep growing exponentially. It won't be nearly comparable as the world we live in today, I highly doubt bitcoin will be around till then

sell it OTC. There is absolutely no reason to dump it on exchanges
@_date: 2018-03-02 16:42:35
'but they killed more people'. That's just a bad argument to justify killing innocent people. I'm not saying it's avoidable, I'm saying you shouldn't be ok with it
@_date: 2018-03-02 16:20:18


Until you are in that situation yourself. It's always easy to justify these things from the comfortable side. The problem is, are we taking enough measures? most likely not. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:38:08
And you think that is hard? U.S. Marshals auctioned $52 Million in Januari. If they don't care about the price and it's just about selling the btc to pay back people who lost it, you could easily sell it below market price aswell.
@_date: 2018-03-02 15:28:06
they are probably now, just that they end up killing more regular people, just like it has always been
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:48:22
US marshall auctioned 54million in januari. Ofcourse it's easy to sell btc OTC. Technically they could even discount it to market price if the sole goal is to pay back people who lost it as it .

until you would be in that position. I doubt you'll think it's fine then
@_date: 2018-03-08 15:39:07
people just think that if they see a price on an exchange that's the worth. but there has to be someone crazy enough to sell for single digits in the first place. If it's only one trader, it will just jump back up
@_date: 2018-03-02 17:37:12
Yes, but that doesn't justify people saying it's fine or they do not have any problem with it. It's a problem as long as it happens, justifying it because measures are taken is ridiculous. Like I said, as long as it doesn't happen to you it's easy to say you are ok with it. Nobody is going to be ok with it if it actually happened to them 
@_date: 2018-03-02 16:35:52
I'm not saying he would. It's easy to justify something when it doesn't truly affect you. But if you are able to look at it from another perspective, the answer will be a lot different.

I meant if they want OTC. But realistically, they sell already at a discount on an exchange because if there's not enough supply they lower the price. So they could have easily sold at a better price with OTC. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 10:49:10


the "whale" orders are just for controlling price movement. No whale is going to buy/sell big amounts on an exchange, that happens OTC else they would influence marketprices and end up buying too high or selling too low. The only reason for doing it on exchanges is to manipulate the price/supply.

For me, there is a difference with saying you are ok with it and accepting it is unavoidable. Semantics yes, but a distinction that should be made in my opinion. I accept it's unavoidable, doesn't mean I'm ok with it.
@_date: 2018-03-02 16:40:30
even if you think proper measures are taken, I still don't think you should be ok with it. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 16:24:05
You are talking about an encapsulating name for everything using a blockchain. Nobody is going to change bitcoin's name, unless you create a HF ofcourse.

Can someone TLDR these great and rational points? Because I'm not finding them
@_date: 2018-04-20 06:54:30
complacency until we hit 4.5k seems likely
@_date: 2018-04-20 10:30:30
based on?markets follow cycles.btc has so many things in common with other markets if you look at the graphs it wouldnt surprise me there will be a major and quick seloff to return to the mean.wich is around 4.5k. the big players will descide our fate yet again
@_date: 2018-04-23 08:24:48
everything would be defunct.no electricity,running water,oil.chaos everywhere.fiat,metals etc would barely have any use anyway.unless you have a bunker stocked with food, water,guns.good luck.
