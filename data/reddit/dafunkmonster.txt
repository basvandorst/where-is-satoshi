Investing is always gambling.  Always has been.  You're betting on how other people value things or will value things in the future.
Don't count on your retirement portfolio seeing constant growth over the next 20 years.
Don't count on your house being worth what you paid for it when you're ready to sell.
Don't count on the $100 bill in your pocket being worth the same in 10 years.
Everything has risk.

"What is the catalyst for this crash though?"
The bears overcame the bulls.
The real answer is that the hype bubble is deflating.  Bitcoin was overvalued, but nobody really knows where it should end up coming back down to.  So it ends up being a volatile ride to new price support levels until there are enough buyers to stop the fall.

It’s certainly primed. All the “printing” done by the Fed hasn’t really moved yet. Federal debt is large enough that even a modest increase in interest rates would make the debt service unaffordable, which could be the trigger that kicks things off.

@_date: 2018-08-15 15:13:26
The title of the post includes "you will see countries going into economic crisis and could see the organic adoption of cryptocurrencies".
If worldwide economic crisis occurs, it will likely be because of the United States monetizing debt.  Meaning, the Federal Reserve will be expanding the monetary base ("printing' money) to buy US treasuries to try and keep the federal debt service affordable (because eventually, nobody will want to keep buying treasuries, because they'll be deemed junk, and the interest rate will necessarily rise unless the Fed buys them up).  
The Fed has already dramatically expanded the monetary base over the last 10 years, but that glut of new dollars hasn't entered the economy yet.  It's mostly been held in reserve by banks.  If something were to trigger enough velocity of money to start bringing those reserves into circulation, then we would likely see the inflationary effects of doubling the monetary base in less than a decade.
Meanwhile, Federal debt continues to grow.  We're approaching $22 trillion in federal debt with $114 trillion in unfunded liabilities.  Total household, small business, and corporate assets total only $138 trillion.  Annual GDP is only $18 trillion, and this is in a period of strong growth.  But that growth won't last forever.
The United States is already insolvent.  And given that we're doing nothing to resolve that, it's only a matter of time before we see financial and monetary ruin.

Nobody was talking about the Great Depression.  Why the hell did you bring it up?  It has nothing to do with the topic at hand, which is the insolvency of numerous governments around the world (including that of the United States).


It's only accepted among Keynsians.  And not even Keynes was really a Keynsian by the end of his life.
The Great Depression was triggered by Smoot-Hawley.  The imposition of massive tariffs (60% in the case of 3,200 goods) and the ensuing trade war turned the recession into a depression.  Unemployment peaked and was subsiding in June of 1930 when Smoot-Hawley was signed into law.  It wasn't until after the tariffs went into effect that unemployment rose into double digits, where it stayed for the duration of the 1930s.

The crash in 2008 was caused by government forcing banks to give out bad loans and government holding interest rates artificially low, and then when a normal recession came along, banks started failing, because people couldn't afford to pay their mortgages anymore.
@_date: 2018-08-15 16:00:23
The federal government imposed low-income housing quotas on Fannie and Freddie.  This quota started out at 30% in the 90s, but increased to 55% by 2007 under the direction of HUD.  That is, 55% of all loans given out had to be given to people who were below the median income level in their communities.  When the recession of 2008 occurred, and those people (predictably) were no longer able to pay their mortgages, it nuked the housing market, and led to the financial collapse.
This was exacerbated by the fact that the Federal Reserve had been holding interest rates near zero, which created a mortgage bubble on top of the poisoned loans created by the HUD quotas.

That's only true for fixed bills.
And billers who are stuck with fixed bills will quickly lose their shirts.
Anybody who isn't stuck with a fixed bill is going to keep raising prices as fast as necessary to keep up with inflation.
So, your fixed-rate mortgage might get easier to pay down, but your house will be worthless, and your groceries and gasoline will cost more and more.  The utility companies, forced to contend with skyrocketing costs but fixed revenues, will be unable to keep the services on.  Eventually, their charters will have to be amended in order to allow pricing changes to reflect rapidly changing costs.

The problem with tulips was that anyone could go out and make more tulips.  So their scarcity (and high prices) was short-lived.
But there will only ever be a finite number of bitcoins (so long as the fundamental rules are not changed).
Is it possible that people will abandon bitcoin for some other means of storing or exchanging wealth, thereby causing the price of bitcoin to crash?  Sure.  But the foundations of the bitcoin market are not nearly as shaky as the foundations of the tulip market in 17th century Holland.  In fact, I'd argue they're quite strong.

Yeah, tulips rose dramatically in popularity, faster than the tulip supply could keep up.  The price skyrocketed.  Then the supply caught up to demand, and the price came back down.
Anyone trying to make money speculating on tulips was engaged in a foolish gamble.  Because the supply was always bound to catch up to demand at those prices.  It's not like there was a finite supply of tulips.  Once a growing season or two passed, there were going to be more than enough tulips to satisfy demand.  What happened was an abrupt shift in the popularity of tulips, and the market reacted and tried to find a new price.  But because new supply of tulips lagged behind demand, you saw a dramatic but short bubble.
If you look around today, though, tulips are still sold everywhere.  It's a multi-billion dollar industry, and one of the biggest in Holland.

It's not a security upgrade.  The keys are generated on an unsecured system (the "air-gapped" but not really air-gapped laptop), and then "backed up" somewhere "safe".


Great plan, Frogolocalypse.  So now the whole world knows that all they have to do to steal all your bitcoin is figure out where you put those volumes, and what your password is.  Since you mentioned that you don't store them in your house, we can pretty easily guess that they're stored in the cloud somewhere.  Because if you're too cheap to buy a hardware wallet, you're definitely too cheap to put anything in a safe deposit box.  And you're probably bad at picking and remembering passwords, so the password to those TrueCrypt volumes is probably the same or similar to a password that you use for one or several of your online accounts, one or two of which has probably been compromised at some point.  Not to mention that all I need in order to steal all your bitcoin is infect the machine that you use to decrypt your TrueCrypt volumes - which, even if you use the "air-gapped" PC to decrypt them, means you will have to move your volumes back to it on an infect-able medium.  Keyloggers are a thing.  Malware can easily hitch a ride on whatever you use to move those files around.
The whole reason for having a hardware wallet is to ensure that nobody can access your private keys, not even you - you can only make your hardware wallet sign transactions using your private keys.  Copying private keys around and posting them in encrypted files around the internet or copying them onto a USB drive that you store under your mattress violates that principle.

I always chuckle to myself when people talk about the dollar being stable.
You can't measure the yardstick using itself.  The dollar only appears stable because people don't bother checking it against an appropriate yardstick.
There is really nothing out there to measure the stability of the dollar in terms of price.  Because people decided that the dollar should be the yardstick.
If we decided that oil was the yardstick, then the dollar would be considered wildly unstable.  Likewise for gold, silver, avocados, bottle caps, etc.
You can't reason about the stability of a currency based on prices (this is where people generally go wrong).  You can only really reason about the "stability" of a currency by looking at the supply of that currency and the nature of how it grows or shrinks.  And for fiat currency, that supply is virtually unbounded.  For bitcoin, it is finite.

You're conflating two different types of catastrophe.
Yes, in a post-nuclear or post-solar-storm world, yes, bitcoin will be worthless.  
But HODLers aren't hedging against that scenario with bitcoin.  They're hedging against the collapse of the value of the world's reserve currency, which is a catastrophe that grows ever more likely with each passing year.  
US federal debt cannot continue to grow indefinitely relative to US GDP or even world GDP.  Eventually, the US federal debt service will be unaffordable, either due to too high a debt balance, or too high an interest rate.  In either case, the only way out will be to monetize debt to artificially pull interest rates down.  There will be no way to tax or confiscate our way out.  At that point, the value of the USD will go the way of the Papiermark, the Zimbabwean dollar, and the Bolivar.


What happens to the interest rate paid on federal debt when people stop believing that the USG can pay back federal bondholders?  Contemplate that and get back to me.


Look at Venezuela.  Cryptocurrencies are all the rage there.  People are clearly taking refuge from the collapse of the Bolivar in cryptocurrencies.  It's silly to believe that the same wouldn't happen with the collapse of the USD.
If the USD collapses, that will be precisely the time when people realize that the value of the world's reserve currency shouldn't be at the mercy of some government's whims.  And that is precisely the time when everyone will flee to other means of exchange.


Nonsense.  Monetary collapse doesn't result in instant destruction of all civilization and technology.  People will still go to work.  They'll still get paid.  It's just that they will have an incentive to spend their paychecks (made out in USD) as fast as possible.  And they'll have monthly or weekly salary changes instead of annual.  Yes, things will get bad.  But society won't grind to a halt the instant the dollar starts dramatically losing value.
A wise person would hedge against both scenarios by holding chicken, bullets, *and* bitcoin.

First, that's false.  Recorded history is a very large chunk of time.  Banks have only existed for a small portion of that.
Second, banks have historically operated at the mercy of governments.  There haven't really been many opportunities for banks to operate free from the influence or control of government.  If banks have failed to provide "financial inclusion" to anyone, it's arguably because they have been ham-stringed by governments.

You seem to be under the impression that banks are just places where people stick their money, and all the bank does is keep it for them.
Newsflash: Banks lend money.  They take the money that people deposit, and they lend most of it out.  If the people to which they lend money fail to repay it, then the bank can end up closing.  Depositors will only get pennies on the dollar, because the bank doesn't have 100% of their deposits on hand.
Bank runs, contrary to your third grade understanding of the banking industry, are not the only way that banks can fail.

I love when people operate on the assumption that FDIC-insured deposits will always be safe.
FDIC insurance is only good when a single bank goes under abruptly and unexpectedly.  But that doesn't really happen that often.  If a bank goes under, it's likely to be part of a flurry of closures, which means there will be a lot of other people demanding to get money that doesn't exist (because it was lent out to people who couldn't pay it back, for example).  With a large scale banking collapse, FDIC insurance won't mean jack shit.  It'll take you ages to get your money (because there won't be billions of taxpayer dollars sitting around waiting to be dispersed), and when you do, it'll probably be worthless by that point.

Because banks never lend money out to people who don't repay them. /s

We have many examples of what happens when currency is *manipulated by central banks.
@_date: 2018-07-27 15:44:09
You're right, the most logical theory is that people hold currency that's losing value and sell currency that's gaining.

You know you can buy fractions, right?
@_date: 2018-07-27 13:43:01
You need a citation for the idea that people spend currency that is losing value and hold currency that is gaining value? Lol
@_date: 2018-04-11 15:12:23
Bitcoin can become a mainstream way to pay for goods and services without being massively devalued, because it is so easily divisible.  The idea that mainstream adoption must necessarily come at the cost of value is fallacious.

Nobody can, practically speaking, purchase something for $0.000001.

When the dot-com bubble popped, the internet didn't disappear.

Except there is.  Pets.com is just another cookiecutter website relying on traffic to generate ad revenue.  Amazon is a revolutionary online marketplace.  Bitcoin is more like Amazon.com than like Pets.com.
Bitcoin doesn't have a static protocol.  It's malleable.  We know the technology is fundamentally sound.  It has first-mover advantage.  It has wide support on a number of trading platforms and devices.
We know cryptocurrency is never going away, and Bitcoin is the first and biggest of the cryptocurrencies.  It's a safe bet that Bitcoin isn't going away anytime soon.

Yeah, but if you asked a bunch of college students if they wanted a $1 bill or a pinball machine, they'd take the pinball machine.

It's foolish to believe that 5 year old price history has no bearing on trading within the last 90 days.

Wait until the government of your "developed nation" can't afford to service their debt, and see how long your statement holds true.
@_date: 2019-05-21 14:27:33


Do you mean 50% of people work for the government? Or 50% of people are receiving welfare benefits from the government?  Or both?

If your private key is on a PC hard drive or USB drive, then you don't have your bitcoins secured.  
You need a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2019-05-21 15:32:44
Nonsense.  It's the other way around.
@_date: 2018-12-11 17:17:40


In other words, you didn't mean "real dollar value" at all, and have no fucking clue what you're talking about.
@_date: 2018-12-11 17:26:06
The chart shows real dollar value.
Scaling the y-axis linearly is stupid for a value with a history of logarithmic growth.  You lose information, because the resolution is insufficient to see meaningful patterns on the low end of the scale.
Logarithmic scaling on the y-axis fixes this problem.
*You* are clearly the one whose understanding needs help, not mine.
@_date: 2019-05-21 14:21:21


This is the correct way to deal with massive inflation.
Better to convert your currency into property than to hold onto it while more is being printed.

An encrypted USB drive only keeps your key safe from someone who physically steals the USB drive.
As soon as you decrypt the key with a PC, it's vulnerable to being stolen.
The easiest way to steal someone's key is to infect their machine.  It doesn't matter if it's stored on an encrypted USB drive.  As soon as you decrypt the key, even if it's only stored in memory, it can be stolen.  
Also, you are probably decrypting the key stored on your USB drive using a password.  That password can be stolen using a physical keylogger or malware.
With a hardware wallet, the private key is never compromised.  It is never stored in a place where it can be stolen.  The transactions themselves are signed on the hardware wallet, which is not connected to the web.  The only thing transmitted between your PC and the hardware wallet is transaction information.  Even if you have physical access to the hardware wallet, it is difficult to steal the private key from it.

Now you're going to get spearphished.
If you really felt the need to share this with the world, you should have created a throwaway account.
Also, I hope you have your 10 BTC stored in a hardware wallet.  If you're using a software wallet or an exchange, your bitcoin aren't safe.

This is something I've been warning people about in the US.  Anything semi-liquid that isn't directly in your possession is ripe for the taking when government runs out of cash.  If we continue racking up debt, it's only a matter of time.

The central bankers are mostly just dealing with the sewage downstream of the politicians.

For now.
