Thank u all so much.  Great info and some good google fodder(side chain, hard fork, etc) for me.  Sincerely appreciated.  
@_date: 2014-12-27 14:45:51
Very cool!  Thx much.

Soooo, exciting.  As a sorta new hodler and bonafide tech-ignoramous, I can't believe the strangle hold this ecosystem has on me.  I have other modest investments(401k, IRAs, savings, blah, blah, blah) but the only area that receives my undivided attention is my precious btcs.  Shoot, I barely understand how this thing works and certainly can't explain it to someone else(not entirely true, but kinda.....) and I am fascinated.  Addicted.  Very fun to watch this latest run-up, I'll enjoy it while it lasts.  Best to you all!

Thx crazyy.  I think I've been down voted a couple times and actually agree and understand.  It's funny, been looking for reason to chime in but naïveté and shyness prevented me ti now.  My "wild encounter" was a pretty weak entry topic but I'm up here in the f'ing woods - what're u gonna do?!  :-D

disregard, i figured it out.  THANKS SO MUCH!!!!  First tip ever.  :-) 
@_date: 2014-11-14 20:17:03
My comfort level is progressing and it's been a blast.  Recently created a cs wallet.  Moved some bits to/from coinbase and mobile wallets.  Tracked moves on block chain.  Made a purchase.  Fun shiz!
@_date: 2014-11-13 16:48:53
Is this for me?  Not sure how to execute.....  If mine, this is my first tip ever!!  
@_date: 2014-11-14 22:37:56
Quite a boggle....  I tell u what - send me one of those bitcoins and I will absolutely have an answer for u.  
@_date: 2014-12-07 17:44:03
Ok.  Hmmmm.  As u all know, btc is learned in stages.  Confusion re the nature and utilization of wallet files and priv keys and importing to new wallets and safely taking coin out of encrypted cold storage and, and... is the stage I'm in now.  Some of my ?s revolve around how u would provide a spouse or loved one with enough usable info to recover ur btc in case u kick the bucket.  Yet still stay safe secure.  Yada yada.  Any sources out there for this info?  Thx all.

Ha!  I love this place!

While I can def. learn more and refine my knowledge, i'm being slightly disingenous re: my level of understanding.  My theory is - downplay my knowledge and nobody will ask me ?s, therefore, I can't steer ppl down the wrong path.  All jokes aside, I think i'm where a lot of folks are/have been in their progression of understanding BTC - I have just enough knowledge to allay my own fears/concerns and formulate my strategy but not enough confidence in my grasp of the info to assist others in their journey.  I'll get there(or I won't).....  Thanks for the advice tho, I will def. make time to continue the learning process.

Oh, whatdyouknow?!  Square.....😉
@_date: 2014-12-01 20:57:01
Roger that.  BTW, this ? is in re: to my offline cold storage wallet.  Does that change your opinion or should I, iyo, move away from BTC Core altogether?  Thanks for the responses.

All of these, except the palm reader was actually a thumb print and I entered my cell but that may have had something to do with a QR code/wallet scan, I'm not sure.  In hind site, I wish I would have gone with the printed paper wallet option.  Oh well.  Btw, it wasn't a flawless experience and I would change a few key things if I could.  All in all tho, josh was very cool and I'm glad I did it.

Great food for thought.  I've made the mistake of taking someone from "its a digital currency use on the internet" to topics such as difficulty, block halving, release curves, etc. in the span of a half hour.  Stupid.  You can see it on their faces - ok, i get it, can we watch the game now?!  Obviously all btc convos are unique but i'm gonna keep your theory in mind.  Thanks.

Happy new year from Chulitnariverville, AK.  Here's to a prosperous and fulfilling 2015!  Thanks to the crypto movers and shakers for all they do for our community.

I'm not associated with a charity, unfortunately.  Two kids and life have prevented it, so far.  I do want to give a shout out for hospice organizations and their worthiness of our support.  The second half of my life will include support for hospice orgs in some way.  The difference they have made to me and my siblings as we watched both of our parents pass was nothing short of amazing.  Maybe the reason we survived the whole deal.....  Thx for all u do. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 15:01:29
Awesome.  Funny, I never received a txt or tweet or anything.  Damn wifi.....  Ha!  Glad this is something you will/have considered.  Thanks Bruce and good luck with the meetup.  We are all counting on you.  Don't screw it up.  :-D.  Kidding, of course....

Would be neat and productive, for future SRs, to hold a couple spots for btc average joe.  The btc insight and experience of someone outside of the bubble could be really positive for the meetings and the community.  You could find these types here on reddit or Twitter or....?  i know a guy sitting in a log home in south central AK that could be persuaded to sit on the beach for a weekend talking about his favorite geek subject - ME.  Inquire within.....
