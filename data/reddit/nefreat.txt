I would expect bit coins to rise in price as these rich people move in to the market. I suppose my answer is why is it that these hypothetical rich people do not control all of the world's gold, platinum, silver, iron, whatever other scarce commodity? Price rises with increasing purchasing demand.

I'd like to see some evidence that humans have a general time preference for later.

Price of electronics keeps going down. There must be a massive deflation in the tech market but it seems like it's still doing just fine.

I am not really surprised bitcoin came up since they are talking about competing currencies.

You're absolutely correct however I want to emphasize your last point. SHA-512 with multiple iterations is not that much better than what mtgox has now with MD5. Bcrypt is the with a high work factor is the way to go.

I think a good modern example of deflation is the tech sector. Computers and everything related to them are going down in price and going up in quality. Buying a top of the line computer means you're buying something that's obsolete in a matter of weeks. This has been the trend of decades, yet tech sector is not suffering because of it, on the contrary I think it's thriving.

The cute version: 
The more serious version by nobel laureates: The Endogenous Determination of Time Preference by Becker and Mulligan, unfortunately there is no direct link to the paper.
