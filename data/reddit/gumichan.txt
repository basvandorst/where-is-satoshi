They said only cash. The woman at the counter said specifically that it's suspended so it may resume in the future. I also tried to go to a bar and the Bitcoin ATM wasn't connected. BTW I'm not fudding BTC here I'm just sad because I wanted to be able to buy things with BTC and I must have went to Japan at a bad time if there's some law or provision going around here. I saw a lot of articles from 2017 and Japan was doing so much and suddenly when I visit I can't find anything.

I used to live in Japan before BTC really took off and I'm back this year to visit a friend and travel. I went to Samurai exchange in Tsukiji and the Bitcoin sign was covered with tarp and the person at the desk said Bitcoin is heavily regulated and they can't sell or buy it. This was an exchange and not even a shop by the way.

Source on a shop in Tokyo that takes BTC because I would love to actually use it. I'm here for another week and I've been scouring around for places with Bitcoin signs.

I'm in Japan right now and WTF happened? Every place I've been to says they've suspended Bitcoin transactions or have taken away their Bitcoin ATMs due to "heavy regulation". I looked for articles and all are for 2017 and BTC was flourishing here so I came here expecting to pay for a lot with my BTC. I can't find a single place right now that will actually take it. I'm guessing they want only specific channels or institutions like banks to use it rather than the common people or shop owners. This is fucked.
