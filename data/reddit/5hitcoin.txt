I discovered crypto in oct of 2017. I bought the same week I found out lol
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:47:28
Well if you can always say it's from some point that means the coins alive and well 
@_date: 2018-01-01 06:43:31
You seem to already have one because you're feeding people prices.

@_date: 2018-01-31 07:47:15
People been holding since 19k lmao 
@_date: 2018-01-09 06:06:35
bailout 
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:48:32
That's BS. I have an account but haven't logged in for over 4 years. I bet you a lot of those are just dead accounts.
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:47:05
Bitcoin is an altcoin how?
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:56:35
Check your post history lol 
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:08:26
I think planning a terrorist attack and shoppin a pic are different skill levels.
@_date: 2018-01-06 02:07:20
So 3rd world countries lol 
@_date: 2018-01-21 15:01:48
I understood it as it's NOT those things and it still grew
@_date: 2018-01-24 06:56:42
He sold it for 2 mil lol
@_date: 2018-01-28 06:04:54
I check everyday and it's still up from 500 xD
@_date: 2018-01-03 20:52:54
If we knew we'd all be rich soon 
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:05:40
@_date: 2018-01-31 04:31:33
Cause it's hittin 1k 
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:20:01
He has done well. Or do you think he could do better?
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:01:38
Wake me when it hits 20k. I'm bored.
@_date: 2018-01-28 05:58:41


lmao tell that to the people who bought at 19K
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:57:11
Bitcoin is myspace though. Facebook will one day thank it for paving the way.
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:01:05
Waste of $ on drugs. Go get high on your own dime 
@_date: 2018-01-03 21:56:28

OP is 16 and an entrepreneur prodigy while is 35 and still learning how to spell pace properly. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 07:52:38
I bought in at 5k so I'm good 
@_date: 2018-01-20 15:25:34
Will have all my coins off them soon! Can't wait 
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:07:35
Pls edit your stupid mistake 
@_date: 2018-01-06 02:06:04
If you think 25K is a lot you're probably poor 
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:48:20
with dogecoin it would be half a cent and instant
@_date: 2018-01-01 06:44:45
I'm disgusted by that fiat 
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:31:05
Like anyone is going to click on link in this sub. I'll just assume it's something childish though. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:58:02
Goes from 1k to 20k in 11 months


dumbest question of the year 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:09:13
I'd stay here. You'll look poor if you're in the 1-10 category. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:53:18
Bcash is run by BCunt aka Roger Ver 
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:25:14
No then people will be saying I told you bitcoin would crash! Use to be $16k now it's only worry $16! Ha 
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:36:30
He's still an asshole even now 
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:35:08
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:59:19
Insider trading. They're scumbags and colluded with roger Ver to attack bitcoin. Just search the sub for details. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:22:24
So what's the big deal 
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:23:55
Just like how you're gloating about your 3 baby trades? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:26:32
I've only bought in in October at 5k. So far never traded or sold one time. I think you should edit the post and put a poll in. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:06:17
It's too bad apple.com is already taken 
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:38:38
This guy doesn't have kids 
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:31:22
I'm offended that they think I was dumb enough to attach my name to my crypto purchases 
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:16:55
I thought the family bought this for OP cause bitcoin went from 20 to 11k last week. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:00:32
This thread is full of people with zero social skills.
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:31:48
No because you're a dumbass 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:52:25
Because bcash is a scam and coinbase sent out an email to not dump your bcash. I have double too but I'm dumping it day one 
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:27:01
I don't think you realize most people that want a nice looking car are bad with $. My coworker has a 80k Audi with a salary in the 60k range. Using a payment calculator you can get an 80K car with less than $1000 month payment over 7 years. If you're single  with good credit you can literally buy any car you want.
Then there's even more ridiculous people like the guy on reddit who bought a 100k+ Mercedes Benz and lives out of his car.
My point is millionaires can drive a Toyato and a car isn't an indicator of overall wealth. Even if it's a damn Bugatti it could still be a rental.  
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:28:37
Many just to get the car but as an owner it's cost 1 btc a month on average to maintain it. Not worth it. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:00:39
I'm probably going to die with my bitcoin. I honestly have no sell price in mind 
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:19:33
I still own my first ever satoshi from October 
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:49:19
Sounds like someone's talking from experience :p
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:16:00
It's $8-9 to get me from the local plaza where I get groceries. I give $10 incl tip.

Reckless 
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:55:52
This is such nonsense. Pls lets not upvote this shit. I almost didn't get into btc cause of the crap on this sub 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:33:38
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:21:56
Oh wow so I guess cause you don't no one else does lol that's not how statistics work kid  
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:44:01
Scam cash is a scam. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:31:03
Do fleshlights count?
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:36:31
Because by the time you mine it bitcoin will be worth triple as you just wasted your time 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:10:20
Started on the bottom now we here 
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:19:31
It will eventually 
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:04:19
No worries! I lost $50 from the nicehash hack earlier this week lol we all make mistakes. Good thing mine was a small amount. Best of luck to you as well!
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:06:35
I got charged a $43 fee today for 29 minute transaction lol
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:57:02
$10 is NOT my average. 90% of my rides are under $9. My average fare would be much lower. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:26:04
It's sad how many idiots there are involved with such an amazing technology like bitcoin. (The guy above you I mean). 
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:22:53
Why not just memorize it? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:37:26
It's not regulated at all. Where TF have you been yesterday. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:54:36
This isn't my post dumbass
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:41:48
When I die I'm getting my btc etched On my tombstone cause I AINT EVER SELLING! Hodl
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:21:55
Why would it matter. I hope you don't store anything of value on coinbase lol
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:49:09
I downvoted just because you asked 
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:45:03
I don't consider an alternative for coinbase another coinbase exchange lol 
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:53:42
Shut up and take my comment! 
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:04:12
Bang, got homebase 
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:58:52
Useless post. What are you going to do when it doesn't? Nothing? Ok so just delete the post 
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:25:34
A taxi ride here cost me $10 in Canadian 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:13:06
Scumbag? Smartbag*
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:53:59
So I guess you agree with my point if that's all you have left to say
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:56:23
Waste of $. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:14:36
So with fees added in you now have less $
@_date: 2017-12-29 15:00:57
This is why I dogecoin 
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:54:29
If you don't want to pay taxes you should buy anonymously 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:06:01
Can confirm. Under OPs wife now

I've been on Reddit for 6 years but if you think any of use our main account for cryptosporidium you're an idiot. If you didn't make another a account for this sub. You're an idiot.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:07:44
I have alt accounts older than yours lol 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:33:25
Just a joke since that's what some people are saying 
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:13:02
Too bad you're not smart enough to know your experience is way above the average. Unfortunately for you Math skills don't come with age lol
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:35:22
GDAX is coinbase 
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:25:12

@_date: 2017-12-11 04:44:32
I just hope it's not a life changing amount. Can use it as a lesson and I'd invest back in cause it's still early. Least you'll never let it happen again. The addresses are so long so always check the first 4 and last 4 characters to make sure you're sending it to the correct address. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:55:28
It's best to be quiet so we don't know you're stupid rather than trying to defend something we all know isn't true. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:53:14
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:32:49
They're like 80k used and that one doesn't look new at all.

@_date: 2017-12-14 14:51:16
Ah the old redd...
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:15:19
Smart guy. He still has 7800 coins 
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:55:38
Waiting for him to delete the comment 
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:35:03
That's understandable though. If you don't know computers than you'll be lost. People saying their parents can't repeat an English word is stupidity. You could teach a parrot to say bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:16:11
It's not new. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:58:17
What dip? It's still expensive AF
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:05:13
Isn't this the fear factor guy ?
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:02:32
Just ask your parents. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:25:01

@_date: 2017-12-18 03:07:44


@_date: 2017-12-30 03:36:13
But I live in a major city I can get to 3 major malls and 100s of shops for under $10. What's your point? 
@_date: 2017-12-25 15:46:28
Interesting points. Thanks for the reply
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:56:09
I'm also a parent. That's why I think the rest of you are of low intelligence.
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:05:58
It's a rough estimate. Stop being a prick. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:45:48
Doesn't matter what you think. They have $ they can buy if they want to. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:12:17
That still doesn't conflict with my original point 
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:29:10
Cause roger ver would refuse the $1 Million ransom unless it was sent as BCash
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:02:29
Found the noob 
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:13:04
School is a waste of $ now 
@_date: 2017-12-18 07:36:51
You don't need it. I have a good career with just high school. There are some people who have degrees at my work which was a waste for them since they didn't need it to get the job lol 
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:03:17
Any of those leaders could buy 1000 btc today if they wanted 
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:49:26
Yeah useless reddit voting will help 
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:59:26
Holidays are for pussies 
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:08:13
So All I have to do is post a pic of a fake bank receipt to get girls? Ok.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:23:13
I would agree with that but bcash is like a Nigerian prince email. Lowest of the low 
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:38:57
But I don't check the price of terrorism 50 times a day 
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:57:43
Is everyone parents retarded on this sub 
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:08:47
Your orginal statement was not a fact 
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:32:33
It's possible bitcoin will be 0 someday. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:20:03
That's exactly why I sold at 18k lmao 
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:03:23
So much insecurity in this sub 
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:43:25
Shady business is still business. I'm dumping them too, stop trying to get people to lower their standards 
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:34:51
School being a waste of $ is true more and more every year. When comparing this generation to the last its night and day (which OP is referring to).
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:38:27
Take your blindfold off while you're at it
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:32:42
Because I have too much info on my main. Hackers can use it to brute force your wallet password etc if they have enough hints. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:29:13
Historically? It's still a sin lol 
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:29:15
I got mine at 5K each. I wish it was 25% off 
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:03:44
Yeah cause you can compare crypto currency with a selfie website for teens 
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:30:03
I could hug 20 pussies but I still wouldn't catch up to your experience :D 
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:31:04
Keep your bull to yourself next time 
@_date: 2017-12-18 09:42:33
Litecoin is up 8000% this year. It's shitting on Bitcoin lol 
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:58:26
The holocaust never happened. That's just your opinion 
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:05:39
I didn't see any dip it's still over 10k
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:07:15
I definitely will not be kicking myself lol Less than 1K is a very small % for me. I was playing it safe. I wish I invested way more.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:49:18
If he was crushing puss then everyone would believe he has a Pretty Huge Dick. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:21:17
I left it as a chunk because didn't want people to spot it too easily lol sometimes people read the end last so that's why no TL:DR 
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:40:02
Why gold? Just buy a brick if you want a paperweight. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:04:36
Just like the demand for alcohol dissapeared when it got outlawed. Oh wait..
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:55:26
I have no worries. I'm not dumb enough to use my main 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:22:16
You're also retarded if you think speaking has anything to do with writing. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:13:54
So stop downvoting people for making sense. You look like a cult 
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:19:58
Exactly. He's a bum and a thief!
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:23:33
Dumb I would say. I sold at 18k. Why you wait until 12 lol 
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:50:04
It's called car payments over 72 months. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:04:31
What'd you say!?
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:14:36
Can confirm. No one gave me money :(
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:24:50
I guess it's yours I bought? 
@_date: 2018-03-06 14:08:29
No they don't. It's just everyone here owns crypto so anyone saying bitcoin isn't going to the moon is NOT an expert. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 15:53:19
Smart if they bought last year and sold.
@_date: 2018-03-20 12:47:30
If you own bcash you have a small dick 
@_date: 2018-03-27 15:05:44
Wow he looks older than 5
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:16:46
Depends on the bonus. The fee was irrelevant the past year. Gains too big 
@_date: 2018-03-17 13:49:46
Your mom
@_date: 2018-03-01 03:15:46
Lmao that's a lie. If that was true than you need to change credit card companies ASAP
@_date: 2018-03-17 14:01:37
Your mom
@_date: 2018-02-27 06:21:50
What do you mean bajillion other times? Like when people were guessing dates? There's only suppose to be 1 rapture and no one knows when. Anyone who says they know is a fraud. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 00:50:18
All these noobs here. I bough in at 5K so it's never went below yet 
@_date: 2018-03-10 19:54:15
It's flat just like my bitcoin profits 
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:55:55
Probably not lmao I bought at 5k and again at 9k. Didn't buy any after that but haven't sold either 
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:21:10
Bonus is always worth more then the extra btc or no one would do it 
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:57:21
You invested too much then 
@_date: 2018-02-26 14:54:06
It's just a made up theory. You can say anything you want also and there's about as much proof for it lol 
@_date: 2018-02-20 00:20:54
Probably will cost more to renovate that old ass barn 
@_date: 2018-03-14 14:52:29
Less than 1% of people have bitcoin but everyone here is acting like everyone knows about it.
@_date: 2018-02-27 12:31:08
No it's not. Those are also mining bitcoin

That's irrelevant. If coinbase went bankrupt it would crash the price for a while

Who would sell at under 10k. wtf if you're going to sell you should've sold at 19k,18k,17k,16k,15k . Honestly I didn't sell any of mine after it went below 15k just to be safe but under 10 is just dumb af

OP you must be a real vile disgusting perverted creep to be able to find that

Smart people were buying bitcoin with credit cards. You transfer the $ from your bank to your CC. Spend it on bitcoin and get points/bonuses etc Then you put the $ on your card again. Using credit card doesn't mean you don't have any $ lol

Foundation run by regular wage slaves. Bill doesn't do shit

They don't really have a choice. The bitcoin was sent to help fund research and supplies will be bought with fiat. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 07:05:13
You're literally mining for bitcoin. If bitcoin was the most profitable then it would switch to it and mine.

Or get a brain and realize there's always loopholes 
@_date: 2018-03-01 12:22:13

$0 is an insane price and probably a year or 2 away

Terrible movie and actor. 
@_date: 2018-03-28 12:27:21
I bought specifically so I could get bitcoin. Yeah we have to mine altcoins cause it's more portable but 90% of people aren't keeping that shit 
@_date: 2018-02-27 22:50:58
Your mom disagrees 
@_date: 2018-03-17 13:57:57
I bought in at 5k so I could sell and make profit 
@_date: 2018-03-26 20:46:15
Since his post made the front page I'd have to say op was right

Nice hash is having a blast 
@_date: 2018-02-17 22:52:29
All 4 of those exchanges could just up and run at any time. Too easy to say "we got hacked". 
@_date: 2018-02-27 12:33:53
You just said it lol mining! If btc was profitable you'd be mining btc instead mining other coins getting paid in btc 
@_date: 2018-04-12 19:11:51
I know it. I also know 99% people wouldn’t do shit even if they knew about it. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 17:44:47
She was mostly round 
@_date: 2018-04-16 01:16:17
Just like bitcoin, you go round and round and get nowhere 
@_date: 2018-04-09 13:08:48
Sorry I just fucked her. She is now full whore 
@_date: 2018-04-13 05:25:53
It’s too bad to see so many backwards jokes involving a future technology like bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 12:35:43
Dude f the users. Take that $ and run 
@_date: 2018-04-13 11:59:45
Never heard of that. Doubt I’d watch anything that needs to rely on edgy humour to carry a film.
