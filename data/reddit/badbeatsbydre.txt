I know I won't, its just not in my nature to do it, at least directly. The heavy daily drinking that has developed will most likely do it eventually though. I am sure you will make it someday but I just don't feel like there are any opportunities left for me after I have squandered so many of them.

Don't feel obligated to give me anything but i won't say no at this point.

That would be encouraging if I had some opportunity to reinvest but unfortunately my current and most likely long term life situation prohibits that for the most part. Thank you for the encouraging words though I do appreciate you taking your time to respond.

Almost in the exact situation as your brother, same age and everything. It's a really bad feeling, like it hurts inside so deeply that I fucked up so badly it's really an indescribable feeling. I'm poor as shit now and could be a millionaire. Will I kill myself? Probably not. But I can absolutely understand why he did. It's a really bad feeling.
Sorry that you lost him.

Its not like I am beating myself up about it. It is nothing I can control its just whenever crypto currency is brought up I get this really bad feeling that is hard to explain or compare to anything else. It is totally an involuntary response. I mean Yeah I am angry at myself for failing so many times but the worst part of it is that I most likely will never get another chance due to my financial and general life situation. I appreciate you taking your time to try to make me feel better about my mistakes.

I mean yeah obviously i could put in a dollar a week. It's just that making a significant amount from the amount I would be able to invest is impossible at this point. I could be cruising in a yacht wiping my ass with million dollar bills and instead I have decided to barely afford rent every month and it hurts so bad. Anyways this isn't about me is about op's brother. I really just wanted to let him know that I understand where he came from having been in exactly the same situation and to offer my condolences.

As someone who has done some gambling I totally can see the relation between the two but the near miss or loss feeling fades away pretty quickly. This has been something that keeps me up at night and distracted all day every day.
