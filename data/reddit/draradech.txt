I actually don't think he is a lunatic, which is also why I believe he would not go through with checkpointing a majority of miners out of the network. I *do* believe they (Mike and Gavin) can actually convince the majority to go along with larger block limit. In that case, we have a consensus hard fork and nothing bad needs to happen.
@_date: 2015-06-12 06:51:20
That doesn't work. You won't convince merchants and users to use your new version, so from their point of view your blocks would be invalid. Miners aren't all-powerfull, even if they have &gt; 50 % hash power.
@_date: 2015-06-12 08:09:13
Ah. That proposal obviously can't work (as pointed out by your comment, which I now understand). It would need to remove all validity checks (to allow the longest chain regardless of rules). So everything would be valid?

Thats not all of them, the 0.10.1 xt version was incorrectly identifying itself as core. This query gives all the XT nodes:  (currently 98)

Maybe because this video is more than a year old?
@_date: 2015-06-10 09:35:26
Thats only partially correct. The networks would disjoin, so you would normally spend only in one chain, yes. But if all inputs are valid in both chains, the transaction will be as well. Anyone can copy the completed transaction to the other chain and it will be repeated there!
@_date: 2015-06-12 15:17:08
That's a good data point (and the price figures are plausible). However: Increasing the limit to 8, 20 or Inf MB doesn't give you big blocks right now. The size of the average block will still grow with the average number of transactions, as it always has until now. So it will actually change nothing /right now/, but allow bitcoin to continue scaling naturally.

Which is actually what Mike Hearn was proposing (in the last Epicenter Bitcoin Episode), in case the chinese don't go along with bigger blocks. He called it messy and undesireable, but possible. (Changing wallet code and checkpointing the "correct" chain). Note that I'm for the block limit increase, but against checkpointing anybody out (bad idea).

Didn't they merge Coin Control? I thought it would be available in 0.9.
Ah yes, found it:  (line 253, GUI section)

This is not possible. The block header contains enough data to immediately see if proof of work was done. Creating a valid block header has the same difficulty as creating a real block.
@_date: 2017-03-16 17:30:48
This has nothing to to with unlimited. If you activate without majority hashrate, the following will happen:
1) Everything looks ok, all transactions are valid for all participants.
2) Someone submits a segwit-invalid transaction (for example spending anyone-can-spend) to a non-enforcing miner, who builds it into a block.
3) The chain is now split, with segwit-enforcing participants on a minority chain - the original bitcoin blockchain leaves the segwit enforcing participants behind.
@_date: 2017-03-17 10:39:37
But you will have a chain fork. You only need one exchange listing both, and it will be permanent. Everybody is concerned about BU forking, but totally fine with risking a fork due to UASF. I think it's way to risky.
@_date: 2017-03-16 09:50:02
A UASF still needs mining majority. It assumes miners will react rationally to an impending UASF activation (and enforce it on activation). In the current climate I wouldn't count on rational miners.

Pretty much all of them have said in case of a fork they would list both coins.

1% chance for 9 blocks in 30min starting at block 1.
1% chance for 9 blocks in 30min starting at block 2.
1% chance for 9 blocks in 30min starting at block 144.
(without checking the claimed 1%, but in a quick simulation I get on average 1.7 [disconnected runs of &gt;= 9 blocks in 30min] per day)

@_date: 2017-08-01 13:51:31
we have 144 blocks a day. something happening with &lt; 1% chance will happen about once per day, no?
@_date: 2015-08-28 13:01:09
But still much better than 21% being able to lower the block size limit.

Currently trying to get the logo onto pxls.space as well (at 308, 874). Script is [here]( although limited usefulness because of captchas (script places pixels, captchas need to be solved manually).

I advise you read the article. The 2000% profit come from 20% more energy efficiency in a business with 1% profit margin.

The consensus machanism is not in the software development, it's in the bitcoin protocol itself (i.e. the software the majority is running). If BIP101 is adopted by enough of the ecosystem (by running a bitcoin implementation with support for BIP101), core will have to support it or die. If core adds support (which is likely in this scenario imho), we end up with multiple bitcoin implementations, which is _more_ decentralized, not less.

You're off by a factor of 10. Your price was 0.20€, they took 0.10€ in fees (of which 0.02€ were used as miners fees). That's a bit better than 1.00€ in fees, but they still should clarify their fee structure in the terms.

Paperwallet, I assume? The usual way is to generate a bunch of them at once (completely offline, without writeable storage connected, obviously). Test one with a small sum (deposit, withdraw). If it works, the others generated with the same method under the same circumstances will work as well.

@_date: 2013-10-21 14:56:07
Yes. But at what time that is going to happen depends on the transaction fee. The transaction fees will be bigger if blocksize is a limited resource. More miner reward (in form of block reward + transaction fee) equals more hashpower in the network, making it safer. So blocksize directly influences (future) hash power of the network during and after the transition to "half or more of the blockreward are transaction fees".
