According to the information they provide it is in BRL:

I was not in conversation with him, so you're definitely more knowledgeable about this case.
I was assuming it from the news, I mean he mentions about this "friendly regulation" on one side, but on the other side he had to collect info about all people manually in his computer..
@_date: 2014-08-11 22:37:00
Well, this is not "Bitcoin", but rather a "Bitcoin ATM", and not a transaction (payment), but rather purchasing or selling bitcoin (converting to fiat and backwards). Market defines the price, if nobody would like to use it at 5%, the rates would be lower. To be honest this is an average value, some charge 10%, for example.
@_date: 2014-08-26 21:04:12

Nice example of how much can a Bitcoin ATM earn, I just added it to the collection of [other examples](
@_date: 2014-10-05 22:02:55
As I said palm scan is only for Robocoin. All the rest don't have it.
Gov ID can be also required, but it is definitely not required in Lamassu machines and there are several in Ontario.
Also it is not always required in BitAccess machines. There are many of them as well.
Recently I added a Localbitcoins ATM in Toronto. For this you only need a localbitcoins account.
Speaking about the fees, for many machines you can find info on  but just as an example in Ontario - Ottawa there are two Bitcoin ATMs charging 3% for buy operations (at least this was the last info about them).
You can find some machines even with online rates on the site.


it is possible to buy without verification for 3% in Ontario through Bitcoin ATM.
@_date: 2014-09-22 05:52:20
no, according to my knowledge the one in Flat 128 charges about 6% and the one in Coin Cafe charges 2.95% only.
Average market rate for all Bitcoin ATMs are about 6% nowadays, I recently wrote about it 
So I would say both machines are in the market or even better than the market now.
@_date: 2014-09-02 08:30:32

This machine in my personal opinion is one of the best value/price relations in its niche and is quite undervalued by the market as it has at the moment only [8 units installed worldwide](
By running coinatmradar.com I'm in contact with many operators, and this machine was highly graded by the ones who run it, especially the ones who worked/operated several different ones (different types of ATMs). I also got positive feedback from people who actually used it.
I would agree with people who says that Skyhook is only $999, which is 2.5 times cheaper option. Yes, Skyhook machine is cheap and very nice and basic. I mean, I like the skyhook project a lot. They give a huge value to the market, as almost everybody can purchase and install their machine now. Look, they overpassed Robocoin, and now have 50 installations worldwide. But on the other hand, Skyhook due to it's basic set-up doesn't have some useful features.
There are many things marked in the [blog post]( regarding PROs of General Bytes, I would like to mention several here:
* has **POS** integrated by default, so you can run a restaurant and install this unit and you have two products in one: ATM and POS terminal. It even supports tipping to employees.
* **remote management** For example, this feature is missing in Skyhook, and you need to visit the machine every time you want to change the settings (to my knowledge), however in GB you can do this remotely, sitting at home.
* **multicurrency** (fiat, crypto) support. Again, skyhook is open source, but you need to develop it yourself, however here it is supported out-of-the-box.
* **KYC/AML**. Many people say you cannot do KYC based on fingerprint, in anyway this is supported and I find a nice feature. Also you can scan the docs, you can verify customer by phone and depending on this set flexible limits of transactions. In Lamassu for example there were no verification features supported until recently when the collaboration with IdentityMind was announced. However, it is still not clear what kind of checks will be supported. Because of the lack of this functionality, e.g. [QwikBit developed their own verification procedure]( thanks to open-source code of Lamassu. However, using GB you can be compliant in many places using default settings and not needing to develop anything custom. 
* it has a lot of **integrated wallets** and exchanges, e.g. recently they integrated and now support Coinkite wallet.
* The machine has a lot of small features, e.g. you can buy bitcoins using your email only, so that created private key is encrypted and sent to you. I don't know any other ATM with such feature.
Regarding CONs, I don't find many:
* one thing, and this is what I mentioned to Karel (owner) already, is that it would be nicer to have 10'' screen instead of 7''. I think Lamassu machine is much user-friendly now after they moved to bigger screen (10'')
* another drawback, maybe the price can not be easily accepted by random enthusiast, however as I said the functionality-wise you can not compare it to Skyhook, I would rather compare it to Lamassu, which is about the same size and costs $6500. So, the price for GB is definitely worth it in my opinion.

ok, I see, but this is still really strange that API is subject to DDOS attack. This is something to be implemented for a lot of high-frequency requests, otherwise it simply becomes unreliable and you can not base any business on this.
Anyway, looking to integrate it differently, just pitty that spent a while to implement it via blockchain as supposed it is kind of big player and should handle such simple things in more proper way, that just becoming unresponsive.

@_date: 2014-10-22 19:31:58


This. The problem is that people don't bother to spend time even to report new, or remove non-existing. The same issue happened with bitcoinatmap.com I think, although the resource is very nice and has many features. It is at the moment user-content driven and not many ATMs are added there.
I run the Bitcoin ATM Map [ and need to spend couple of hours daily to track new locations and remove non-existing (Room 77 was removed a while ago). To my knowledge it has the most rich Bitcoin ATMs information with [1.3 ATMs added daily on average](

your calculation is actually wrong, it is not 5-&gt;1, but rather 30-&gt;5 with current price. So they take 25 cents on every send out BTC transaction.
I just give an example, you buy twice a month bitcoins for $100. And don't store with them - withdraw immediately.
They say their exchange fee 0.2%, and for Bitstamp it is 0.5%, looks like Kraken is much cheaper.
But applying this hidden fee, which they take from BTC withdrawal (Bitstamp by the way don't take these fees, because they do withdrawals in a bulk, but not individually, probably covering it on their own), and above described scheme, Kraken exchange fee comparable to Bitstamp becomes 0.45%, and in this Autumn it will become even more expensive.
So for big traders kraken is definitely an option, for average Joe - Kraken is more expensive than Bitstamp, although they provide the rates as if they are cheaper.
I did have trades on the Kraken, and ready to pay this, not a problem. The problem is kind of bad feeling left after, it is like buying something in the shop and then cashier gives you 30 cents less change. Not a big deal, but better be honest.

Tell me please how many there were bank ATMs in 1970 worldwide?
@_date: 2014-06-30 11:39:55
Very cool service, but when you say you are transparent on the fees and don't get any mark up on the exchange rates - can you explain how do you achieve this? Do you actually buy those bitcoins you receive on your own account at market exchange rates (simply storing the BTC)?
*Edit: I see you already answered that you store the BTC. But then it is probably not a long-term viable solution, as at some moment the critical mass of remittance would overcome your capacity to purchase bitcoins yourself.*
As of now I checked the site you charge flat 3% per transaction for transfer (similar to what BitPesa is charging for example). And then I checked the exchange rates you use - and it looks like to be full truth that you don't charge anything additionally here as mark up.
So I chose I want to send 1000 Philippine pesos.
You show on the site that 0.036585 BTC is required.
I assume conversion through USD, I get current Bitstamp rate of $630 and also I get PHP to USD conversion rate of $22.896 per 1000 PHP (
So in case you get my bitcoins and convert them through Bitstamp and then settle and exchange this to PHP in your local bank at rates which I got from google (assumption), you would get:
0.036585*630/22.896 = 1006 PHP (or even a bit lower because Bitpay will charge for conversion and settlement), which is almost the same as inital 1000 PHP you promise to deliver.
So there is no exchange mark up added here. Very nice!
If you do the same with BitPesa rates - you get additional exchange mark up of about 3%, which makes the total price of the service about 6% and I find quite high.
Do you have any plans to deliver money to mobiles? Do you have something similar to M-Pesa in Kenya?
@_date: 2014-09-26 06:26:36
Have you contacted the operator first?
@_date: 2014-05-26 11:46:08
Well, I agree with you except that the market is bullish now. It could be exiting the bear trend and changing it to bullish now, but why not just wait another month if you already waited for two months in order not to harm the market if it is true intention.

@_date: 2014-10-28 11:32:48


This is definitely the case. But I think many get some compensation in the increased traffic, if it's local retailer. Plus the installation costs are major ones and once it is set up - it is operational. Whenever there will be another buzz on the market, those machines already in place will get some good piece of pie, as many people will try to buy bitcoins via ATMs (as the fastest and the easiest option for beginners).

Thanks for the tip.
Not really a bunch of feedback)) as you see you're the only one.
Regarding "takeover the default URI handler from my current wallet." - in any case this was not allowed by apple store review team, and required resubmission. You cannot give a direct link to a bitcoin address, even for donations.
Regarding the rest - we tried to do it simple as possible and also useful, by default it should zoom to your location (if location services turned on), but you can zoom out back for the full world map if you want to.

@_date: 2014-12-07 09:39:09
Recent update of Robocoin software forces you to use their wallet first. First you need to buy bitcoins into their wallet, but you can withdraw it later to your own address. All the other machines send bitcoins directly to youк address.
Regarding ID - depends on the machine. E.g. lamassu and skyhook in majority don't ask for this.

I think this was exactly because of regulation..
"For federal compliance reasons that Stromberg calls complicated but doesn't detail further, he takes down my name, address, and phone number in his Netbook before I can use the machine. He said he has to monitor users of the ATM for "suspicious activity.""
The set-up which required a person sitting near to it and manually inputting information about users into netbook - could not last long.

ok, I see your point. But you're totally wrong regarding my incentives. I don't trade bitcoin and don't "make" any money monthly. I do have some investment - but this is for long term (2-3 years), so the short term fluctuation I basically don't care. And actually if the price goes down makes sense for me more, as I purchase more cheaper :))
I was not complaining, just posted my thoughts and wanted to hear opinion of others.
Just to make it clear, I didn't buy at 1000 or something, and now just decided to HODL. I started buying at about 550 and was doing all the way it went to 400, the last purchase I did was at its flat bottom recently before latest growth. Basically I can quit the whole position with profits today. So I'm not stuck with any positions.

* Lamassu - is the map of the countries where they sent Bitcoin machines, but not where installed. I was in contact with Zach, he was planning to incorporate real locations based on our API

Your awaiting time was due to the first registration with them, next time you don't have to register anymore. It will be much faster. You just identify yourself with the palm vein scan and do the cash out operation.
I think it may depend on the amount, but sometimes even 1 confirmation is not needed. So it will be immediate transaction. In case of large volume, they may ask you to wait for confirmation on the blockchain, but it really depends on every operator.
I would recommend you to give it a chance and try once again. BTW it is not necessary to use this exact ATM you registered with, you can try any other Robocoin ATM, as they are operating under Robocoin AML/KYC general system.
There are 3 Robocoin kiosks in Austin in total. Search here [

Well, actually it does to some extent, many new entrants expect some kind of "bubble" which happened before, but if this bubble was just artificially created, then it is something that may not happen in the nearest time (contrary to what is expected based on the history by many) as the infrastructure evolved and there are several exchanges today for example, compared to Gox controlling the whole market before.

Agree, I'm myself like this.
In any case - those were just my thoughts. The Bitcoin market is in its infancy and is highly manipulated by the news. My assumption that potentially this report was a try of manipulating it. I don't say the report itself is wrong.

The [markup of Bitcoin ATMs is 6%]( on average. But with increased competition it probably goes down.
@_date: 2014-06-08 23:01:56
This idea of using Bitcoin ATMs as remittance machines is clearly defined in [Robocoin plans to convert ATMs to separate Robocoin "bank" branches](
Robocoin indicates that Robocoin Bank will incorporate new features such as cryptographic provable reserves, instant bitcoin-to-cash withdrawals and **the ability to send cash internationally as part of an effort to build what it calls “banking and remittance 2.0″**.
Also quite similar idea is mentioned by CEO of Lamassu, when he mentioned that their Lamassu machine could become something like Apple store, where different apps could be developed. And one of such apps could be a remittance scheme.
We are definitely moving to some better world, although those regulatiors are currently impeding it, but this is quite normal.

Average Joe will not see Coinbase or Circle on the street, however ATM brings value as it is easily accessible for the public, not only to the ones who already know all about bitcoin.
I many times see people ask "how to use" and "what's this" when they see a Bitcoin ATM. Maybe speaking about future, ATMs become less valuable, but at the moment this helps to increase awareness and adoption.
@_date: 2014-10-29 21:55:54
Here are some figures, but I highly doubt they show "level of satisfaction", I think there are many other reasons, why the machines are not live, one of them is regulation
Mid summer - about 200 machines
Here is recent post saying "more than 200"
And another one saying more than 250
So I assume there are about 250 lamassu units shipped at the moment
with 94 installed units this is roughly 40% installation rate
in June (1 month after start) - 150 units were shipped
My rough guess would be they sold about 400 machines at the moment, as they are the cheapest and affordable option, even to buy to play with it
so the installation rate for them is about 10%

I think this is pretty meaningless to post the same comment from bitcointalk here, especially after several days. The idea for this research was to make an aggregation of data, which is not present in any other source. It is not about saying that "fees are too high, you should avoid ATMs", it is information, that could be used by many people, e.g. somebody installing a new ATM could check what are the average fees on the market...
So, yes, Bitcoin is volatile and ...? how is this relevant to any conclusion made in the post?

Disagree, the markup in Europe on average is less than in North America and Oceania, for example

The magnitude of volume doesn't look to be related to any tipping and followed test usage by ordinary people. It is several 100K BTC.
Not sure whether there is such metric as you mention, but the change is happening since Sep 2014
There are two more charts
number of users 
and number of transactions 
But they don't support your assumption imo
Just realized could be the easiest explanation that due to low price of BTC the volume in fiat may stay about the same, which gives an increase in BTC volume

if you give a hint which numbered icon (number and approx location) - I will check, but this should not be the case. When autozooming after click happens - there should always be the exact number of atms which was on numbered icon before.
Some manufacturers icons may be not that prominent, so just try to scroll zoom a bit, and probably you can see them.
Information for every atm is displayed when you click on the lowest level icon (1 atm).

@_date: 2014-09-10 12:48:13
You're missing the main point here I think. When you say "most ATM's in England are free". This is free if your account is in GBP and you withdraw GBP. But try to withdraw EUR in the same transaction, and I believe it will be not for free (comparing to the market exchange rate, but not the bank exchange rate). Also the "free" applies to the ATM of the bank, who issued your card, but then you pay yearly for the card, etc. If you withdraw from the other bank ATM, you normally pay the fee.
I mean you cannot compare it one to one. Right now the Bitcoin ATM market is only starting to grow (first appeared in the end of last year) and this is monopoly to some extent (at least in the Bristol city, for example). 5% is about the average now, even when the competition plays in, I still expect it to not go below 2-3%, because you pay for convenience. You can always register at exchange, provide all your docs, wait for approval, wire money and wait couple of days more, and then you can buy-in with 0.5% commission, but instead you can use cash immediately, and it has its own price.
This is ridiculous to expect it to be done for free, isn't it?

Up to some limit - no, just information about yourself.
I used Bitstamp for a while and also tried Kraken recently.
My impression it is more advanced in settings. And also I have not to pay anything additionally for SEPA payment, while Bitstamp charged me $15 for SEPA payment (paid from Switzerland). So for small deposit amount transfers - Kraken is definitely better.
And yes, the main thing is Kraken - for trading EUR mostly (although liquidity is still small, but the biggest they have of different fiat currencies), Bitstamp has only USD.

Thanks for the comment, will look into it. The limitation was in the number of maps to be loaded (didn't want too many to be loaded at once), will check what I can do there.


The duplication check is done by me carefully, so there can hardly be a case. Regarding the duplication - if you have any API where you provide the list of ATMs - this would help a lot and I clearly will follow all new locations. I do have similar functionality with other manufacturers by the way.


Geo clustering pages is something on my list. Just thinking how to better to do this. By country it is not a problem, with cities sometimes it is a bit messy - as there are many small cities around main ones - like Scarbourough, Mississauga around Toronto.
Anyway, this is something planned to be added - thanks for your feedback.

If all countries in the world make Bitcoin legal tender - this also will solve all the problems


Why not simply forbid to have any connection to Bitcoin? Isn't it something what happens in Russia now (with this planned ban for spring)?
The government in Russia puts a lot of additional control now, look at the recent laws and companies behavior.
I will give you just two examples: 
Yandex has switched all agents for Yandex.Direct ads to their direct support. So now all money should flow through Yandex and you need to fully register with them providing all your details and signing the contract (which was not the case before).
Also look at the latest Law about Electronic money. They are just trying to control all and everything buy putting a lot of limitations.
So I hardly see any close possibility to what you suggest about any such service in the near future. Unfortunately.

It is not really a centralization, while the pool is not a miner. Pools exist until miners use it.

* It is either GHash itself becomes a scam - doesn't make sense economically
* Somebody hacks the GHash and implements the attack using connected miners - but this will be quickly revealed and GHash abandoned

I was not accusing anybody, just said that the incentive is very low.
Regarding the fees - 1% is definitely not the advantage of the company:
- they get market share increase
- they have other projects, where they can use bitcoins received in this remittance service.
Why I assumed it is low, just a simple comparison of how much the company will need to spend to get same results through adwords, will require about 20-50 times more funds and I think this is the market price.

This is very nice application of Bitcoin ATMs and definitely other use cases will follow.
The only problem I see is that by making the transfer (remittance) a function of Skyhook ATM - this will probably require a different licencing, which will become an obstacle for the operators.

this 7% is really strange, because it looks like the machine is charging 5% actually. This is the info I had before and also the current spread for this machine, which can be checked online here
also identifies there is a fee of 5% for this machine, but not 7%.
@_date: 2014-09-12 13:53:02
* payment method: cash vs funds wire (e.g. you don't have an account, or don't want to send form your bank acc as there were cases when accounts were closed because of this)
* time: immediate vs several days (not only the transfer, but also acc approval with exchange if first time)
* AML/KYC: no identification vs sending all your docs online (depends on the ATM type, but normally no more than ID doc will be online when buy via Bitcoin ATM)
* More secure if you compare to purchase from someone on localbitcoins
* new users access - in case of exchange you need to install and get acquainted with wallet software, in the Bitcoin ATM you can print a paper wallet (although poor from security point of view, as it is recommended to transfer funds). Check this video from Marwood cafe in Brighton, people simply don't know what Bitcoin is  I hardly beleive those guys will buy it over exchange, but buying through an ATM is an option.
* sparse location availability (check [Bitcoin ATM Map](
* higher fees
* lower purchase limits (depends on the machine)
* mostly support buy operation, only some support sell (EDIT: this is not fully true, relation is 60/40)
* mostly operate with BTC, only some with LTC and Doge

You need just to uncheck "Fiat-&gt;Crypto".
And leave the tick in "Crypto-&gt;Fiat" checkbox.
That means you will see only the machines that sell cryptocurrency, all of them are two-way (as the machine which gives an option to sell, also gives an option to buy). At the same time the ones which support only "Fiat-&gt;Crypto" (one-way) will be hidden.
So you will see *only* 2way ATMs.

These fees are additionally to the fees of the ATM operator?
@_date: 2014-09-10 15:04:59
Compare buying Bitcoins in Bitcoin ATM and not on exchange to buying a can of coke in the vending machine on the station instead of buying it in the supermarket. It costs normally about 2-3 times more, but you don't say that these fees are too high, you simply buy it or not.
The value of the coke for you is the same wherever you bought it, and this is exactly the same with properties of the Bitcoin, wherever you bought it in the ATM or on exchange.
Yes, infrastructure is very immature, but this doesn't give a reason to compare "bitcoin's low fee transactions" to "Bitcoin ATM high fees", this is like comparing "green" and "wet".

coinmap is supposed for off-line merchants only, bitpay mainly has online shops I assume
@_date: 2014-10-21 10:44:34
Oh, Germans! Need to create a new Coin ATM type on  :)
@_date: 2014-11-22 10:13:57
Depends on what you need..

Lamassu doesn't have this, but then to be law compliant the guy from cigar bar in ABQ has to stand near the machine and put personal details of all the customer into his laptop.
I think it should be legal compliant, Robocoin does their job properly, the only question is not it too much? But I think it is better to be on safe side, at least when it is not very clear what the regulators may come with.
If you talk about fiat currencies ATM, then KYC happens actually when you open account in your bank.
That would be a good idea in my thinking to split those two processes, registration and actually transactions and make it more similar to using ordinary ATM. Moreover for accessing those ATM you may not have a card even, if there is a different process defined for user identification.
That means all those cash machines in place, could be used as vending machines for BTC purchases.
@_date: 2014-10-22 18:11:05
You mean traditional bank ATMs? Why should it show them?
@_date: 2014-09-08 11:41:00
sure, normally you can send an email, but report it here - it's fine, I will update the listing

The world cannot be conquered overnight. Give it some time and don't judge based on current state.

Added to CoinATMRadar - this is [Bitcoin ATM  in the world](  at the moment
Quickly moving to 100 :)
@_date: 2014-08-22 23:11:08
not really, those are the ones related or announced about issuing Bitcoin ATMs, but many have 0 installations, and many have not passed too far behind the idea or prototype. See in the left sidebar number of atms installed in brackets for every manufacturer. I still need to order them in descending depending of number machines, then it will be more obvious. There are about 6 main players in BTM production at the moment.
@_date: 2014-09-24 14:05:43
Well that was not the meaning I put into headline, probably due to non-native English. 
The idea was that in 30 years people will look at current Bitcoin ATMs the same way as we're looking now at this machine from 1969.
I wrote a post about it recently -comparison of bank ATMs evolving and Bitcoin ATMs 
@_date: 2014-06-25 08:53:18
First of all congrats - nice project. I'm representing Bitcoin ATM locations site [ and now I have only 5 ATMs from Skyhook on the Bitcoin ATM map (and you say 150 were sent out). I know there are several other sites tracking locations of ATMs as well.
My question is - do you have any info about where the machines are installed? Or maybe you can collect such an information by making it part of relationships with buyers, and then broadcast this info to others, so that there would be a one access point for the public. I also could collect info from this "API" and put it on the map.
@_date: 2014-06-18 06:20:59
You are absolutely right, but let's call them "one-way ATMs".
I had a post on bitcointalk, where summarized which ones are two-way and full meaning ATM, here it is:

the affiliate program looks interesting, but 10% from 1%, which is 0.1% doesn't really motivate to participate
@_date: 2014-08-23 12:27:56


regulation is against you, those stores will have to obtain additional licenses, like MSB
@_date: 2014-09-09 06:38:23
Here you can find some figures
@_date: 2014-06-17 21:57:43
yes, I've seen this news, but they are not yet installed, and there is no clear info where it would be located.
Whenever news appear - would add it to the map.
@_date: 2014-08-23 07:40:20
at this time, there were many articles starting the same :)
then they reduced it to "the first Bitcoin ATM in ..." and a country name, although there were already other ATMs in the same country..
@_date: 2014-09-21 13:26:40
On [ you can see whether Bitcoin ATM is online or not, and also online rates are available for many Bitcoin machines.
Check here 
PS anyway, the more competition the better)) so would be glad to check new Bitcoin ATM site
@_date: 2014-11-24 20:29:28
Here is a good news - there is a new two-way bitcoin ATM installed Genesis1 in The Diner.
So maybe you would like to try it out.
Online rates can be found here

With lower Bitcoin price the fiat equivalent of operations should not be influenced a lot on average.
@_date: 2014-12-25 21:29:06
There are different types of ATMs, some don't require ID. Check the locations on [coinatmradar.com]( Also there are tutorials how to buy and sell bitcoins with ATM.
@_date: 2014-09-09 06:20:29
hey, thanks for the tip.
This news about Spanish ATM producer is old one (Feb'14). They initially launched one ATM in Barcelona, but then removed it. So there will not be 100 ATM in Spain in 3 months.
Anyway, the growth speed is quite fast, check here: 
@_date: 2014-08-24 21:22:49
here I provide the list through API 
but collect them manually, believe me or not
will appreciate if you can send the link when you find it, so I can use it as well)
@_date: 2014-10-30 20:35:32
Why do you want to compare exchange operation with money transfer operation?
@_date: 2014-09-24 17:58:09


This is exactly what I meant
@_date: 2014-08-23 09:43:14
This is not a new one, but rather relocation of existing one! I know about it, will update the listing.
@_date: 2014-06-17 21:37:57
yep, you are totally right. There are many Numoni machines in Singapore. Totaling in 8 ATMs.
I was just looking and entering info about Vancouver Bitcoin ATMs, where there are 6 machines. So I was a bit biased here)
@_date: 2014-06-20 18:15:11
just replied above


@_date: 2015-01-02 22:30:04
Do you have the same source as this one 
Or you did it from scratch?
@_date: 2014-07-01 17:34:41
Would be very interested to discuss. you can pm me here or write an email, which is available on my site (mentioned below).
Regarding Bitcoin ATMs - this is pretty cool idea.
Hope in case you go with this solution - would notify me, so that I can add those to [Bitcoin ATM map](
@_date: 2014-08-22 09:01:53
[ - is the place to go, send me your info and I add your location.
@_date: 2014-10-19 17:05:10
Lamassu? Do you have pics of a new machine?
@_date: 2014-09-15 12:00:45


The explanation could be that early adapters are using their coins, which were mined back three years  for example, - use it to buy stuff with merchants, as it is more broadly supported today than say 1 year back.
I think this is not related to the newcomers into crypto, as they probably top-up balances, whenever Bitcoin are spent.
