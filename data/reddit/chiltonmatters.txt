Up in Vancouver or Seattle just fine. You'd be surprised at the number of suburban neighborhoods in Seattle with 60% occupancy because the other 40% are simply a currency hedge standing vacant.

Many simply invest in American real estate. Much easier. Buy home. Done.

Firstly bubbles are hard to define, but why would that even make a difference?

Well thanks. It was mostly a lot of luck and nothing we really planned too much. 
We just found a place we liked and had a quick conversation regarding the fact that it wouldn’t be likely to drop much in value. But we also don’t have kids so we weren’t very restricted.
Interesting anecdote. My wife did a walk thru and said it was cool, so I looked up the pictures online and the comps and history and said “go ahead and make an offer” 
The realtor was freaked out that I wasn’t able to visit it (I was out of town). But we had to escalate in two days - asking with waived inspection

Don’t worry, we’re not involved in a bubble situation. Trust me

I’ll stop buying it now, but say you made $10,000 month and  one month you spent $1,200 in a month?.
And the next statement is clean, etc?

My mom always taught me you buy a place only because you want to live there. We got lucky and it went up 5x in value. Will it drop to 3x in value in 2-3 mos? Not likely. But possible. Who knows
The places we’re looking at are less than our first mortgage. So for us i guess we’re lucky and humble enough that any place find will be fine. I don’t want to say too much more
Real estate is a tough investment strategy. So many people are desperate to pay off their 4.5% loan when - barring chaos in the markets - in the long run that extra money could be gaining 6.5-9% assuming previous econometric history data is a good predictor.
That said i can remember when paying off a home loan was a (sometimes) good strategy when interest rates were 10%.
He’ll, in 1981 interest rates hit 17%!

I get that and I know all of the traditional rules of thumb, I’m just asking if purchases are different than deposits.
Ideally we’re at a place where we don’t to wait three mos

Trust me, there are hundreds of economists studying this as one the first powerful, political currencies, if not in our lifetime, if ever.
Try finding reddit groups with people arguing about the Peso. There are people at the highest levels working on this behind closed doors with related sentiment. Ya got no idea what’s coming.
That said, this guys an idiot.
P.S. get your coins off the exchanges by the end of July
