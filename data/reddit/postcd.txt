I do not think that the image OP provided is too far from reality, as yours mentioned article links to a sources that shows that the Bitcoin electricity consumption is probably higher than the country of Ireland -  "Recent published estimates of bitcoin’s electricity consumption are  wide-ranging, on the order of 20‑80 TWh annually, or about 0.1-0.3% of  global electricity use" (it was researched back in 2018?)

For example Ethereum and Litecoin is said to eat less than 50% of electricity comparing to a Bitcoin usage while still using proof of work verification mechanism. ETH is preparing to move to a Proof of stake mechanism which i think should decrease it even further.
"Ethereum (ETH), the second largest cryptocurrency by  market value, processes more than twice as many transactions as the  bitcoin network while using only about one-third of the electricity  consumed by bitcoin. ETH also operates on a Proof-of-Work (PoW)  consensus mechanism"
