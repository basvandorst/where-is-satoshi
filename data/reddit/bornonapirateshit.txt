Didn't someone make a bet on that?

Did he know that buying bitcoins is legal? What a weirdo.
@_date: 2013-11-20 23:09:01
Except you really should change your wallet every time. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:20:35
This is fine, it will legitimize bitcoins.

If you bought gold and held it for a year before exchanging it for a plane ticket, would you report that gain on your taxes?
@_date: 2013-11-14 14:56:00
This isn't an investment, it is like buying Hong Kong dollars because it has been going up against the USD.
@_date: 2013-11-20 14:24:10
You are not trading in your fiat currency, you are just transferring it to someone else.

The tax deferral argument is not actually accurate.  
This is a good article that covers the Canadian tax authorities position:

I think it is a commodity that has currency features as it can be used for other purposes such as smart property tracking.

That is just some random making a forum post 3 months ago before mastercoin even existed.
I would recommend reading up on it here:  
Also I would recommend the subreddit @_date: 2013-11-22 02:14:43
They are probably reporting on a non-gaap basis and excluding amortization.
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:56:58
As someone who has used these, let me tell you how shitty the exchange rate is. I checked it this morning, bitstamp was $750. The atm rate was $870 to buy.   Cdn to USD is 5%, so gross up to $788. That is still a massive cost. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 15:14:42
That guy is a pos.

You can't because credit card transactions are reversible but Bitcoin transfers can not so no one will take credit card payments.

You really should not be buying a miner anyways. The difficulty is getting so high that you will never make your money back.

In a deflationary environment, it encourages savings and not spending because your money will be worth more in the future even without investment. So you end up with an economy which isn't growing but shrinking. That isn't stable.

The exchanges rarely plan to defraud, they usually get caught in a squeeze and then decide to fuck off with the money. You would be crazy to keep money on an exchange. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:10:59
This is the stupidest idea I have ever seen on this subreddit and we have had some horrific ideas...
@_date: 2013-11-12 05:53:00
"Pay taxes"
@_date: 2013-11-25 14:32:26
Difference is if someone steals your Bitcoins, no one will reimburse you. 
@_date: 2013-12-15 22:32:23
"Your transaction may be placed on security hold for several days. The amount that you're paying will be frozen for this period."
Given that most fraud is detected within the first day or two, they are going on the basis that most people will not defraud them using their own credit card.  Plus they are getting an extra $200 on top of the exchange price so that should cover it.
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:49:52
Great point.  Honestly all the fiat vs. bitcoin stuff aside, if you are not encouraging innovations like this then you are stifling it and other countries will run away with the ball.

How the fuck is gold not verifiable?   Also bitcoins get stolen, a fair bit. We just blame the user and move on.   Bitcoins will have value but let's not pretend that gold has less value.

Those are panic sales where someone uses the quick sell button. You can't time those, you just need to have a buy order in place.   Which works great unless it keeps dropping.

Don't tell her the full amount, just cash out 1/5 and say this is everything.   That way you still have your wealth, she is impressed, and she will not pressure you to sell the rest.

The value of Bitcoins is compounded by the possibilities made possible on top of the block chain such as master coin. LTC doesn't have anything going on like that.

of course you can but the lawyer holds property in escrow.  I can't imagine any lawyer wanting to take possession of something they don't understand that is worth a house.  Lot of risk for insignificant revenue.

Dude, did you even check this before you posted? 
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:15:35
Yeah exactly, someone with a cost base of $700 will be more bullish than someone with $200. Of course when it drops to $400, it is the same person who will sell in disgust.
@_date: 2013-12-06 23:46:19
$200 would be a shock, but I agreed on Saturday when we saw the dip. I got out at $1000 last week, which was fine.
@_date: 2013-12-05 06:01:45

I'm not American.   You can justify not paying taxes in a variety of ways, would I do it in America?   No, it is one of the few countries that send people to jail for not reporting income.

It is someone with a lot of money who does the spread in order to have a lot of liquidity in the system. Think someone sell stock at $510 and buying the same stock at $505, the difference in the amount is the money they make while providing the opportunity to buy and sell large amounts.

There has been many such accusations, whether it is true however, who knows.

It does if the sellers don't want to sell but the buyers are willing to move up.  Which is what has happened, the problem is that the number of buyers is quite low while the number of sellers is higher.  So once the fatigue sets in and they lower their selling price, there will not be enough buyers to take the pressure.  AKA, there is a lot of resistance going higher due to the number of sellers at this price point.

As a tax accountant, I have been fielding this question a lot on reddit the last while (I always get downvoted for it too for some reason).  
Basically US taxation system works on a voluntary disclosure basis with severe penalties for non-disclosure.  These penalties can even include jail time (the US is one of the few countries that does send people to jail for tax evasion).  So it is your prerogative whether you want to be aggressive with your taxes or not.  Personally I would disclose because this topic is really high on the IRS radar (they know that bitcoin has gone from $0 to $900 this year resulting in huge gains) right now and there is no status of limitations on tax fraud so they will not be in a hurry to reassess.  Besides 15% tax and not worrying about them reassessing me with huge penalties is well worth it.

because it misrepresents the positions of people who believe that gold has intrinsic value but use a weak superficial similar position in order to knock it down.

@_date: 2013-11-20 07:06:45
I'm a tax accountant in Canada, right now the CRA (our tax agency) considers these currencies taxable on a barter basis. That is, they have the value of the property received.   So if you trade a Bitcoin for a house, then the proceeds are the value of the house. Now this is done on a trade by trade basis so the value of the transactions will very.   So if you trade bitcoins for boogercoins then the cost is what you paid for those coins and the proceeds are the value of the boogercoins at the time of the sale.  
I would expect that your IRS will treat it similarly but they tend to be overwhelming on the details so expect guidance in the next year or so.

As a tax practitioner, I have seen this a few times.   Basically the example you have lacks the tax base. So if there is no change in value, there is no tax.  If you buy a bar of gold for $100 and trade it for a product worth $120 then you have $20 of capital gains even though you didn't sell it for cash. This is a good thing otherwise you would have a massive tax leak. So if you bought a Bitcoin for $5 and purchased $900 worth of gas on Monday with it then you would have $895 in capital gains income that has never been taxed (hence no double taxation), the flip side being that if you bought a coin for $900 and sold it for $700 then you could claim it as a capital loss for $200.

Assuming it is done honestly and properly.  The clearance certificate is not obtained then the estate can't be paid out.  If the estate is paid out then the estate executor (or trustee of the estate) will be held liable for the taxes payable.  
If it was done dishonestly, who can, say, IRS might have these people flagged as bitcoiners who are worth millions and will probably go after the estate if it isn't paid.

Canada.  The reason I think it will not cause a collapse is taxation.  Both corporate and excise.  
For a replacement currency to be successful, it has to replace cash all the way up and down the supply chain.  To avoid huge swings in fx that no business wants to worry about, it would need to use the same currency for all transactions (with suppliers and customers).  Due to the way excise tax works (seller gets a credit, buyer gets a debit, until it reaches the end consumer.), to actually claim these credits, it would need to be in the 'home' currency.  
You are right, it might someday be an alternative in unstable countries that are using USD but it would need to be rock steady before that happens.

Could we please stop with this crap?   Just because bitcoins could go mainstream doesn't mean that taxation will end, war funding will cease, or that the existing fiat system will be toppled.

I feel like the only people gets rich off bitcoins is criminals.

That is a stretch.

That is a lot of work to grab FX of $100 purchase.

This is why we will likely never see mass adoption of Bitcoins.   There is one of these stories every day. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 14:25:59
This is why I didn't buy Bitcoins in the two digits. I think it is a problem but one that has been kicked down the road. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 22:11:31
But it is a week old! Perfect time for reddit (the human centipede) to repost and consume it.
@_date: 2013-11-20 23:57:25
Less the cost you spent on the bitcoins.   The IRS is issuing guidance, they have not done so yet.

You clearly have no idea what watching only means.

Not always but it is a lot of work.

Keep in mind that the tax basis of the bitcoins can be different depending on which country you are in.   I expect more guidance coming down the pipe.

Use a different exchange.

Virtually all of that is people buying and selling not conducting commerce so that comparison is erroneous.

I'll give it a whirl. I posted Trine.
@_date: 2013-11-22 05:32:57
Yeah, there is also the association of bitcoin with their business that they need to consider.  If bitcoin goes to zero in a few months (since it is highly speculative) then that could reflect poorly on their decision to support it.  Like 80% of everyone, it is a 'wait and see' not a no.

Micro payments are not feasible right now, the fees are too high.

The ATM rate sucks though.  It is like $100 plus on top of the fx.

What? We wouldn't like an analysis by someone who understands topics like deflation and the issues that can arise? This is just one example but besides populous cheerleading, that article was quite light on analysis hence why I want to know if there is someone who can be considered an expert who has also done an analysis.

What product are you buying from a merchant for $10,000 that has a generous return policy?
@_date: 2013-11-20 07:15:09
credit will never happen due to the deflationary nature of Bitcoins.   Debits are possible but I see it being more like ring tapping or just scanning the QR codes off your phone.

What if I told you that if we banned memes the quality of posts would increase significantly.
Why the fuck have we let it get this out of control.

Which country are you in?
@_date: 2013-11-24 05:58:25
Sorry I assumed you were doing the journal entries yourself.  You will need to track it in excel then.
1.  You need to track the number of coins purchased at what cost.
2.  Track the cost of the inventory purchased at what cost (preferably with USD equivalent amount)
3.  What you sold the inventory for and how much you received in USD.
Your excel will look something like this:
Date | Cost  | BTC purchased |Inventory purchased |Sold
1/4/13  $100   2.122 BTC
3/1/13  (1.12) BTC                 $300 inventory
5/2/13  $500 cash received                                    $300

The deposit time is instant "you insert cash", the fees are embedded in the FX, so if you were getting one Bitcoin, it would be $100 in fees. The vault is better.

I don't buy the infinite divisible argument.   You could also trade 0.0001 of a dollar, that doesn't mean that 0.0001 will be worth more later in a deflationary environment.

Accountant here, right now the general consensus is it is being treated as a barter transaction so the value of your Bitcoins is whatever you got in exchange for them. So if you trade them for A $5 hot dog then it is worth $5. In terms of your financials.  Dr. Inventory Cr. intangible assets (until it is zero) Cr. Gain on disposition. 
If you are buying bitcoins then I would Dr. Intangible assets Cr. Cash.
