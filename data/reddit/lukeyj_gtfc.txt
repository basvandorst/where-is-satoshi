Incorrect. Asymmetric encryption doesn't require same key for encryption and decryption. You can also use unique salts for each user. You can store the private keys on a separate heavily locked down box that doesn't return more than x. A lot of professional developers are aware of standards for payment systems and they're hard. If I was working in currency, I'd make sure I knew it. However I've put better security in less relevent systems.
There are potentially major design and architectural smells that don't sit with 1 developer. An organisation that deals with that much money has to have one person that cares about security, knows about it and has enough authority to ensure the this doesn't happen.
Security is hard, systems get hacked. We're no longer in the days where you protect your perimeter. You assume the perimeter can be breached and that despite that, ensure minimal damage can be done from there.

Stand corrected on the salts. You can use something unique per user combined with a common key. 
You could technically store the private key encrypted and decrypt that with a key that is passed into the app at start-up and stored in a black box or as a secret in the build pipeline for example. You don't have to store it all in the same place. As long as the app has the private key when it needs to conduct the operation, 
I'm a server side developer. There are many possibilities. You'll know better than me what is best, but we both know this wasn't it.
