Dear I added this for you:
/coincap -o btc eth
- Gives price of bitcoin in ETH
/coincap eth btc
- Give price of ethereum in BTC
Hope this helps,
@_date: 2016-08-02 17:18:32
Just to add, the way it does it is:
PRICE_CURRENCY = (PRICE_CURRENCY IN USD) / (PRICE_CURRENCY_OTHER IN USD)
Hope this helps and let me know if you need anything else.

Dear newbrict,
I apologize for this.  I take full blame.  It's my fault for not instructing our tech support team more properly.  To be honest, we purge all chat history records for the privacy of you and all of our users.  I'm going to personally make sure to retrain our support team.
Additionally, it seems that they are overwhelmed and, so, we will be hiring more support staff.  This is not how we operate here at Private Internet Access.
I sincerely apologize again.

BitInstant was instrumental in the survival of BTC several years ago.  They took a stand, and we all have them to thank for where BTC is today.

Hi PIA ( does have a proxy service (SOCKS5).  We were also one of the first services to accept Bitcoin (and Ripple and Stellar) and,  as well,  we sponsor the Bitcoin Talk forum,  the Bitcoin Wiki and the original Blockexplorer.  (as well as the Stellar talk forum). 
Please let me know if you need assistance setting up. 
Cheers and have a great weekend, 
@_date: 2015-01-05 22:39:49
Yay!  Thank you!  ^_^

We (PIA) are big supporters of Bitcoin since its inception.

Yes it does!  Sorry, I haven't put the attribution yet &gt;_&lt;.  I had to take a break and eat but I'm going to do it right now brotha!
Edit: Also, I made a pull request on github. ^_^
Edit 2: Added!

CoinCap.IO (a wonderful service from has an API  which is an amazing service to the community.
It features a "websocket" feed which you can think of like a "firehose of trade data."  In other words, every bloody trade that occurs on every exchange that CoinCap.IO is plugged into is output in the websocket.
However, since /coincap was made yesterday, and there were no trades from yesterday until today for NVC, there was no "trade" data fed into the websocket firehose.
Luckily, CoinCap.IO has a secondary location where all currency current stats can be found (as described in the API).  In order to not bog down the CoinCap.IO machine, this location is polled (data is re-downloaded) ever minute.
Thus, the way that the /coincap command works now is to use both data feeds and display whichever feed has the most recent (newest) data.
@_date: 2016-02-27 15:47:54
Nice - thank you!
@_date: 2016-02-27 15:43:46
Dear Sorry about that!  It was working based off the websocket feed.  I had wrongly assumed that all coins would eventually be populated since trades would occur.  However, this was a wrong assumption (well, probably it would be the right assumption if we waited a year haha).
Anyway, the way it works now is like this:
- Polls /front every minute.
- Still is receiving websocket feed real-time.
It will compare the times of the websocket versus the /front data and use the latest.  This means even if the websocket fails, the /front will be the failover (or if the websocket didn't receive a trade yet on said currency, the front will have at least received it).
Thanks and please keep the feedback coming or you can msg me on IRC or gmail.  I put the gmail on the website and IRC i'm just rasengan on freenode.

Another great Matonis article.  He's a genius.

In light of the recent events indicating that [ISPs will begin spying on their users]( the Bitcoin-OTC has teamed with Private Internet Access, the leading VPN tunnel provider, to provide anonymous VPN accounts to bitcoiners.
Portions of the proceeds will go back to the Bitcoin-OTC.

Bitcoin Jesus (Roger Ver) is also on board.  This looks like it will be a very interesting project!

So many responses for Scanning.  So we added it instantly in 1 day.  I'll update the github in about 1 hour!  It's a simple android intent.

This is big news.  I hope that all the merchants will start accepting payments in MtGox vouchers at the least if not in bitcoins.  This is a step forward in the right direction by MtGox, and so we wanted to have this feature available as soon as possible.  Go try asking Meze Grill if you are in NYC to accept payment in MtGox voucher! :)

MtGox Live is now officially mirroring BlockExplorer.com.
@_date: 2011-06-29 16:19:44
When you are using the MtGox Live Bitcoin Trader app on your smartphone and visiting a restaurant, for instance, in NYC, you may want to be able to pay for your meal in bitcoins.  However, this will be hard if you have to input a long bitcoin address.  That's where btc.to comes in.
It is already supported on Firecoin, MtGox Live Bitcoin Trader, gribble, Bitcoin-OTC, and more!

Here is one part of the multi part process you are looking for:

The Mt. Gox Live and Mt. Gox Mobile currency support is in beta.
@_date: 2011-07-03 12:19:38
Yes, this is definitely something we are looking into.  :)
@_date: 2011-10-26 00:46:32
Very **very** soon. :-)

mtgcs2000, now you and the merchants can scan QR from within the app as well. :)
@_date: 2011-06-28 18:30:38
This patch allows you to specify from which address you send coins.  The original client just randomly chooses coins which could allow others to track you. :o
@_date: 2011-06-29 16:17:54
The most recent updated adds support for the changes to MtGox history system.  In addition, now you can watch MtGox Live charts on your smart phone away from your computer!  The apple app will be available on the app store soon!
@_date: 2011-06-29 16:25:10
definitely agreed.
@_date: 2011-07-02 13:48:22
No problem. :-)

Companies like Google allow the use of their Android™ Trademark based on specific criteria/regulation.  Additionally, other companies such as Denso Wave International allow the use of QR Code™ and so forth.  As such, a company who registers Bitcoin can follow suit.

It's always really good to always put it on oneaxis option so you can see the world more clearly.
