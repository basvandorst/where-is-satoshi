But does it run fully encrypted?

DiscusFish is best BTC pool, even better then ghash!
@_date: 2014-06-08 08:12:03
We don't need Bitcoin, we need MYR! 
So let bitcoin gain a 51% + attack.
If it won't be ghash it will be someone else.
Only bout $20 million is needed for 51% attack!
@_date: 2014-05-20 16:53:34
nice, wish i had that one here. power would be costing $0 for me! ^^
@_date: 2015-05-12 21:33:43
you gonna post this about every freaking website out there?
get a life...
@_date: 2015-05-13 06:34:45
i'm not hoping that to buy, i hope that because i have 6TH at home.
lower prices means probably a lot less miners so also a lot lower difficulty
@_date: 2015-05-12 21:48:43
meh i don't see it. plus i want it to stay low... even lower then this would be better. around $100 each... this way all (most) company's who need to pay their bills will go bankrupt and mining really comes back to the home miner.
@_date: 2015-05-16 21:22:08
merchants get a lot of payment systems offered next to bitcoin already, that leaves them saying no to almost every other option then what they are using. at least thats my experience so far. ( i'm not from seattle)
@_date: 2015-01-03 15:40:55
blame the whales
@_date: 2015-05-30 05:47:07
they dont even accept bitcoin..
@_date: 2016-01-30 08:39:46
Isn't that so with about every coin? Myriad needs a much bigger theoretical investment to do a 60% attack.

Silver Law Group is setting up a lawsuit.

Might be worth something to give them a call!
@_date: 2016-01-30 08:38:26
so not true. try to educate yourself instead of thinking you know it all.

takes to long to be because of luck
@_date: 2016-01-23 13:23:35
you tell me 
@_date: 2016-01-23 07:30:15
@_date: 2016-01-14 19:03:25
You can say that, but that hasn't been proven yet. if it turns out to be true you could in theory claim part of your losses.
Right now its about the facts and fact is that people aren't getting their coins out.
@_date: 2016-01-23 07:28:37
stick with core... I don't trust the devs behind "classic"

there is NOT going to be a rollback.
Thats because an ethereum adress hold balance, miners can agree to change that number.
On Bitcoin you'd need to rollback, since a bitcoin adres doesn't hold a balance, it refers to all previous transaction to the very generation of those coins. it's simply add and deduce instead of a database logged number like in ethereum
@_date: 2016-06-23 11:43:50
its a sidechain, you need to trust that chain/its developers. 
@_date: 2016-06-19 09:03:45
it was not a loop hole since it was in de the contract code. It was a creative use of code that made creative user(s) make withdrawals without balance update. Like draining your online casino's wallet. 
@_date: 2016-06-19 17:24:24
trial and error my friend, we are still in an experimental phase. 
Vitalik is not changing anything, its the miners who hold the power. We'll find out soon enough what the miner want
@_date: 2016-06-23 09:36:22
but it adds centralization by adding a 3rd party we all need to trust? Not any better in my opinion
@_date: 2016-06-15 21:56:36
those good reviews are probably all from the USA. I'm from Europe
It was my first and only purchase from them, and i'll never use it again and advice strongly against using their service. Although "Donna Bliss" from the customer backend did talk to me we didn't get to a mutual agreeable solution. i wanted a full payback, they offered 10$ store credit.
@_date: 2016-06-19 09:01:45
no hack, it's more like abusing a bug in your online casino to withdrawal all funds even when your balance doesn't agree with it.
@_date: 2016-06-23 13:05:14
I'm aware that it merge-mines, thats why i'll find a pool that doesn't merge mine it ;) I don't support it so i won't use my 20TH to secure them.
@_date: 2016-06-19 22:04:45
no one is being bailed out.
please read this article, might not even be a need for a soft fork...
@_date: 2016-06-15 09:16:40
i can say DON'T use Egifter!! They don't say what region the cards they sell are in. In my case, this turned out into not being able to use the card i bought.
Although it was only a 20$ psn card. they didn't want to refund me. It was clearly their mistake to not supply region information about the cards they sell, but they wouldn't refund because I had seen the card's code. Basicly meaning every customer is trying to defraud them instead of being genuine.
Bad business in my opinion.

this should be stopped, it painfully to see how many of you are only in it for the money and not to change a whole landscape. 
@_date: 2016-06-19 12:43:55
except your forgetting the part that in ethereum there's no need for a hard fork. a soft work will suffice. 
Where Bitcoin has been plaged by theft and losses, Ethereum's community stand firm against those types of behaviour when its this huge. 
Just because rules are dumb and you are smart, that doesn't always mean that you get to take advantage of them.
@_date: 2016-06-19 09:00:25
nah you should just ask that creative guy to try somthing creative with the code running the online casino ;) maybe it's vulnerable for a recursive call? ;)

gyft is the worst, your not the first one with problem from their codes, they don't work,  are region bound and such.

Nah you can ask mark karpeles for a refund or josh garza
@_date: 2015-04-25 18:27:43
i noticed the transaction going through. i think you can say byebye to your bitcoins. 
good luck
@_date: 2015-09-15 12:38:49
still do without ;)
@_date: 2015-09-15 12:38:16
whats the problem? if you didn't pay the bill it just stops till you pay again?
@_date: 2015-09-15 13:00:06
For now this will work, but people tend to get "smarter" or less stupid.
In my own case, whenever i take a netflix account i cancel the account straight away making it a one time payment and the account automatically stops.  
@_date: 2015-11-09 07:45:15
this is still going on, i've been waiting for more then 10 days now. 1.2 btc
@_date: 2015-11-22 17:35:35
It took some time before my funds got out, i'm happy they are out before this "Server Failure".

never trade with emotions. 
@_date: 2015-10-22 10:22:16
well i won't be using it anymore. IMHO its unfair to do withdrawal fee's atleast not in percentages of the withdrawal. This way transactions can get MORE expensive then current FIAT systems. 
@_date: 2015-10-28 17:55:10
i got a 4 btc withdrawal pending. taking ages
@_date: 2016-05-06 21:51:01
can you enter the movies with half a ticket?
@_date: 2015-10-28 17:53:23
its horrible right now.
No BTC withdrawal possible, atleast not for me the last 2 days
@_date: 2015-10-21 19:01:49
have you seen fee structure lately?
for ethereum, set fee + 0.5% of withdrawal amount....
@_date: 2016-05-08 19:53:47
read what I was commenting on before trying to enter the discussion.
I was comparing it to entering the movies when having halve a ticket ;)
@_date: 2015-10-28 18:05:54
They said the same bullshit to me yesterday, and my funds are still not where they are supposed to be
@_date: 2016-05-07 06:52:23
thats when your being an "attacker", to do that with btc you'd need to do a 51% attack. So you still won't be able to enter the movies without having 51% :)
@_date: 2015-10-21 17:26:56
told last week, dont use it as a bank like you probably do with 21 btc on exchange. Although its a lucky number, i hope you get your funds back. 
next time, i would be happy to keep it safe for you. cuz lets be honest, you probably know me better then you know cryptsy and that says a lot since i'm fairly unknown myself and every one "trusts" cryptsy :P

jup about 3 years of free energy left. Then switching to renewal.
@_date: 2016-07-10 14:10:11
I hope your right, i'm not impacted by high energy prices yet. But i will be in about 2-3 years.

how many people get to work because of that paper shuffle?
@_date: 2016-07-10 08:34:07
thats a stupid question, ofcourse fiat has had more victims.... 
@_date: 2016-07-10 20:54:57
yeah i'll look into it ;) I'm probably within 250km from you
@_date: 2016-07-10 08:50:06
and 75% of hashrate is in chinese hands...
@_date: 2016-07-10 08:48:56
75% of bitcoin mined, 75% of hashrate in Chinese hands. (scary)
when we reach 100% of bitcoin mined, will we also have reached 100% of hashrate in Chinese hands?
@_date: 2016-07-10 12:40:00
that does not make sense, cuz the price of energy is still very different. if it starts to get profitable for people paying high energy prices the people with low energy prices will simply buy more hardware since it will always be more profitable for them as long as this energy price difference is there.
@_date: 2016-07-10 14:20:01
nah, most of the bigger (Chinese) pools don't payout the fee's, so the only ones who are laughing then are those people ;)
