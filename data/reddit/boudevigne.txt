Neat idea!
Even though it is still an early beta, As a communications &amp; graphic design student there is one thing that really stood out: Where's your face? You put time in your design, it looks smooth. However, there is no banner. From going to your website I have no idea what kind of site I'm on. It needs some kind of identity.
Also, some kind of introduction could be helpful.
Are you building this by yourself?

Two weeks ago the price was 580?

Ofcourse. Cannot call them as they are closed. There's no reason for it to look suspicious though.
@_date: 2014-05-25 17:34:15
That makes a lot of sense. Still, cannot call them until tomorrow.

I agree that bitcoin has huge potential and if everything evolves correctly the price of bitcoins will still see a huge rise.
However, that doesn't means it's sound and safe. I still think there are a lot of threats which need to be dealt with. I see bitcoin als thé cryptocoin béta, and hope it will be as succesfull as it can be. However, I also think it's completely possible it will be surpassed by another cryptocoin solution, or to be attacked etcetera etcetera..

1. Rule  of investing. Never invest money you can't lose. While it is likely that you'll make a profit, it is also possible that you lose a big part of your investment. Set aside a budget you'll use for this, so that you'll have something to fall back on.
2. In my opinion (you can only get opinions, it's still a risk), yes, it is a good time to invest. Especially right now, as the stamp prices have just gone down a few minutes ago.
