Yeah, kinda like bitcoin.

Talk about damning with faint praise. Lottery has like a -50% ROI, bitcoin probably has something like -30%. They're both stupid ways of losing your money.
@_date: 2018-10-25 09:47:26
Any century now.
@_date: 2018-10-25 23:13:57
No, that's bitcoin. Like he said.
@_date: 2018-10-25 23:01:30
No, on average. The expected returned value is higher.
@_date: 2018-10-25 09:46:20
Winning lottery tickets have been known to provide much greater returns, sometimes just over a few days!
@_date: 2018-10-25 09:59:55
Not really. Bitcoin is a really bad fit for remittances. 
@_date: 2018-10-25 18:56:06
Lotteries have something like a 50% return rate, that's already a better investment than bitcoin this year.
@_date: 2018-10-23 17:56:01
Oh no!
@_date: 2018-10-30 02:10:13
Not true, plenty of people have lost their bitcoins due to scams, mistakes, bugs, "trading", theft etc.
But that's beside the point. Basic mathematics says the majority of bitcoin "investors" at any point in time have lost money (otherwise it wouldn't be possible for the small minority to have made money, since it's a negative-sum game).

It wouldn't be a pyramid without the bottom layer

Lottery typically has a ROI of about -50%. Bitcoin has crashed more than 50% since the beginning of 2018. Lottery has beaten bitcoin this year.

You still don't understand the mathematics of the situation, do you?
Everyone who bought and hasn't sold yet is *100% in the loss* because bitcoins have practically no use and no utility. You haven't made *any profit at all* until you sell. If everyone who bought bitcoins in the first nine years decided to realize their paper gains today and start selling, bitcoin would immediately crash to zero and most of them would not get anything.  
The only way for them to make an actual real profit is to slowly offload their bitcoin bags to a new generation of greater fools, a much larger group of people, and hope the price does not crash before they're done selling.  
And then the new buyers have the same problem, except now it's a much larger number of people and the likelihood of them finding new bagholders is even smaller.

McAfee is retarded and you are retarded for reposting him.

It has been starting from the beginning of 2018. That does not mean it's a good investment.
@_date: 2018-11-01 01:11:43
Perhaps you missed the point about bitcoin being a negative-sum game here: [  
It's literally impossible for the investors as a whole to get more money out of bitcoin than they have put in. It's a bad investment.
@_date: 2018-11-20 14:40:21
 Bitcoin is already deep into Operation Uranus on all the investors.

Bagholder of last resort, i.e. the greatest fool.

Oh come on. The Chinese govt could just seize all the miners in China and they'd have like 70% of the mining power already, and practically for free.

I never said lottery tickets are a good investment, what a strange idea. I said


@_date: 2018-11-21 22:08:16


What a strange way of saying that Uncle Frank and Cousin Tim were smart enough to not invest in a pyramid scheme and therefore are not sitting on huge losses right now. Maybe you should pay more attention to what Uncle Frank and Cousin Tim are saying in the future.

Bitcoin can be easily DDOSed and 51% attacked to death if a powerful adversary ever wanted to do this. But I'm not saying you should sell if holding bitcoins makes you happy. Just be aware that they can crash to zero overnight and never recover.
@_date: 2018-12-07 16:03:05
While I appreciate the joke some people here *will* take it seriously, hence the downvote.

Once you learn about bank transfers and debit cards they'll blow your mind.
@_date: 2018-12-07 16:18:08


How do you figure?
Buyers control the min value. If nobody is willing to buy, the value is zero.
@_date: 2018-12-22 23:26:59
Actually it's great, much cheaper and faster than bitcoin, AND it comes with chargebacks.
@_date: 2018-12-07 16:13:08
Buy cheaper drugs?
@_date: 2018-12-07 16:05:57
No. Your beliefs do not really matter here.
@_date: 2018-12-07 16:12:09
Bitcoin has no technological "value" because the technology, such as it is, can be copied for no cost. Nobody cares about the network effect either since it's insignificant compared to existing monetary systems.
