You can't have an open-minded discussion with most ppl here about anything because many are idealists who just assume a perfect system. They tend to forget, that in the end humans are greedy assholes and if there is any way to change a system to benefit from that, people will do it for personal profit no matter what.
I'm suprised how naive some "experts" are on this sub. Really blows my mind tbh. We have centuries of history showing us why certain systems collapsed. And yet everyone trusts in humans involved in crypto because "that will never happen with crypto, it's not how it works". 
Yeah, well, good luck with that.

Actually, it's a lot easier than you think. All you have to do is get the right people into the right place and suddenly you have several groups dictating something. Depending on who these groups represent, their influence could have massive impact on everything. 
And there is always a way to convince/motivate people if a lot of money is involved.
"No one would accept such *a thing*" - really? You really think greedy assholes have standards, morals, ethics and do care about others and will hesitate to fuck over thousands of people?
Take a look at history, mate. There is always a point in time where someone has gained enough power/control to dominate a sector and force others into compliance.
Crypto works because people trust in the system. If someone can betray that trust in whatever way, there is nothing left trust in.
