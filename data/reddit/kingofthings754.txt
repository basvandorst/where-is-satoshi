Yea investing with a loan is illegal and dangerous.

Sue them for what? Your line of credit is not your money, it’s the banks money, and they are lending it to you. They are at full discretion to decide who they lend to and for what. Use an ACH or wire transfer and the banks won’t care less cause it’s your money.

You cannot buy stocks with credit though. It is the same idea. Banks take cash advances on gambling as well. At the end of the day, cryptos, Vegas, stocks are all gambling and banks want to make sure you don’t default and they get screwed.

You can’t buy stocks with credit you shouldn’t be able to buy money on credit. There’s no problems here.

The banks can declare it whatever they want.

They can not determine what you can and cannot buy with your own money, but their line of credit is their money.

Investing on credit is what caused the Great Depression. Might not be illegal but it’s not done by banks anymore without crazy fees

Yes but a check is different, it will bounce and you still owe the bank. It is also easier to prove if it was fraudulent. Credit cards can just be stolen and charged back, screwing the bank. We both know a bunch of people bought high and got burned and are now trying to claim they didn’t buy cryptos

CC = loaned money.
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:27:59
Or people steal credit cards and buy crypto and they never see that money again. Debit cards are completely fine, you cannot buy stocks with CC, why would you be able to buy crypto?
@_date: 2018-03-20 15:01:09
It’s a currency. It is money.

Well yea sure, but 99% of banks will not let you gamble on credit. The only reason someone would invest in cryptos on credit is because they don’t have money in a bank account, which is a risk for the bank.

A bank can take your business or assets if you default. They can’t take something that isn’t on paper or material.
