I personally don't think the US or its military is going anywhere soon, but history is littered with powerful countries whose currency dipped significantly in value soonafter.
Maybe I'm projecting as a US citizen, but you can ask Venezuela or Greece how centralized backing of a currency is working for them.

Tbf making it easier to understand, access, and use is the big hurdle for every major technology that's ever existed.

Sounds like your IQ just isn't high enough.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Donald Trump.

They want you to pay taxes on gains realized from Bitcoin. They're not going to ban Bitcoin, they're going to make sure they get a piece of the insane profits. 
Ask yourself this: there's a multi billion dollar industry right now. Would the US government rather profit from taxing it or ban it outright. With the exception of Marijuana, which is already illegal due to long-standing historical precedent, the answer is usually the same thing. The government exists by taking their cut.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Bitcoin. Its future applications are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of computing and economics most of its possible functions will go over a typical investor’s head. There’s also Sitoshis’s free market outlook, which is deftly woven into his creation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Robert Malthus, for instance. 
The shills understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of this coin, to realise that it is not just speculation - it says something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Bitcoin truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the brilliance in Satoshi’s brilliant programming method - the “Blockchain,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Haber and Stornetta's Merkle trees. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as our lord and savior's genius wit unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools.. how I pity them. ��
And yes, by the way, i DO have a Bitcoin tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid ��

Don't forget the transaction settled within minutes instead of days.

Yeah, hours was probably a better choice.

This is absolutely it.
Also, I don't see why everyone is getting up in arms about this. A bill that bans concealment of financial accounts is a welcome change. It should, hopefully, help to deter offshore banking to some degree.

I think theres a bit of a disconnect, because RIGHT NOW Bitcoin can't really be used as currency. The operative words being right now.
That said, it seems like there's increasing support in the world to make it a viable currency. Between technological improvements to lower transaction costs/externalities and an increasing amount of companies implementing or discussing solutions to accept crypto currency, it seems like there's a future here. Well, that and the several hundred billion dollar market cap in the market.
If this does become a viable currency in the future to the level of credit or Fiat, suddenly things become very interesting. The demand for these coins is surely going to rise, but unlike nearly every other economy, it's literally impossile for supply to scale up, which means it's value continues to rise. Will it totally replace Fiat? Not I'm every country in the world, and not in our lifetime, but I'm guessing there are going to be big pockets where that becomes the case, especially with the world becoming increasingly globalized.

But what if it's worth 20 percent more?
The big catch with Bitcoin, at least if it catches on, is that the demand will always outstrip the supply. It literally can't keep up because there's a hard limit on BTC. Now that assumes that it does in fact make itself a viable currency, but for a lot of people that risk is worthwhile given the potential outcome.
This isn't a coin flip, it's a proposition that you could potentially be looking a situation where the currency you're investing in now has 10 to 20 times that value in the future. Given that, if you think there's even a five to ten percent chance this happens as expected, it makes sense to take the risk.

This is the important part. Krugman operates in a certain paradigm and it's in his best interest for that paradigm not to shift or he'll be out of a job.
