I would definitly go with the yach parties and not with the street rioting.

I make at least ten monthly payments with Bitcoin. I just wish confirmations would be faster (like Ethereum); that would make it so much better! Is it on the development schedule for Bitcoin to get faster confirmation times?

Is anyone else as horrified by this as I am?
Bitcoin being a sewer rat, and the banking system being a bubble boy, I knew a day would come when the bubble boy would be exposed to something bitcoin had grown immune to, get sick, and possibly die. I didn't know his protective bubble was already gone. I thought these banks all communicated on leased lines and weren't exposed to the public internet.
Is there any indication that a criminal hacker gang couldn't have compromised this or other SWIFT service bureau's or banks in a similar manner?
Which fiat bank will be the first Mt Gox?

You're right, we shouldn't listen to you.

So now you can take my money if I keep it in cash and travel with it, or if I deposit it to a bank in under $10k increments, and if it's more than that, that's also suspicious. I guess just having money is suspicious these days... we're all supposed to spend it on fancy phones.
Overall, it just feels like the IRS felt jealous of the civil forfeitures.

Shouldn't that say "address reuse in Bitcoin is discouraged"? Otherwise I don't think I understand what he's trying to say.
