How about like, using BTC as a currency?  No?  Anyone?
@_date: 2019-07-27 16:11:38
It's about FUNDAMENTALS
@_date: 2019-07-14 12:45:37
USD is backed by the US Government.  If you can't use your $USD for any reason, we have much bigger problems than your personal bank account.
Are you guys stupid?  Yes.  Really really stupid.

"I want a secure, instant, worldwide payments system that gives me recourse when something goes wrong, I want it to work almost anywhere, also I want it for free."

"I support bitcoin's use as a currency for others because this helps me in my personal goal of hoarding bitcoins in order to turn a quick profit"
@_date: 2018-08-20 02:58:23
So your solution to inequity is a system where the early adopters of btc get lambos and everyone else pays $20k a coin?  How is this going to help the third world 
@_date: 2018-08-21 15:41:54
It's far too volatile to be considered a store of value, but yes the option to access it overseas is useful for you (and traffickers, tax evaders, drug dealers, etc).
And when you got overseas, what could you buy with it?  Or are you going to be trading that back to dirty fiat?  Are you going to have to use a *third party* like an exchange??
@_date: 2018-08-21 15:11:06
Wowww do you mean that youre not really using bitcoin as a currency? 
Do you think there's others out there like you? 
@_date: 2018-08-21 15:45:01
Is that question too personal??  
@_date: 2018-08-21 15:29:44
What's the other hope?
@_date: 2018-05-03 08:13:14
Oh is it irony day already 
@_date: 2018-08-21 15:33:40
I don't believe people here really want to use bitcoin as a currency.  I believe they want to use it as a get rich quick scheme.
@_date: 2018-08-12 01:17:03
Can someone pls link me to a bitcoin discord
@_date: 2018-08-21 15:22:27
Lmao. 
You're advocating people buy and hold something you want to be mass adopted as a currency.  Don't you see how counter productive that is?
Dont you want people to go out and use their bitcoins to buy things?  Isn't that the only hope bitcoin has of success in the long term?  
Or are you just hoping he's the next fool you can sell your worthless coins to?
@_date: 2018-08-20 16:27:55
@_date: 2018-08-21 15:30:55
And how is holding using?
@_date: 2018-10-12 07:29:46
And nobody's using it! What a surprise!
I thought there'd be a line out the door for this.
@_date: 2018-10-15 02:54:15
Never use it as a real currency.
The geniuses around here truly astound me every day.  
@_date: 2018-06-26 14:47:33
And a bitcoiner just belieeeeeeves
@_date: 2018-06-26 14:46:16
Inflation is great if you're using leverage 
@_date: 2018-06-25 13:37:59
Buncha suckas
@_date: 2018-06-25 13:38:48
No it's still completely worthless
@_date: 2019-06-16 10:56:55
Price down sub is dead
Price up sub is alive
It's about the fundamentals U guys
@_date: 2018-11-21 11:47:02

The concept of a currency where almost everyone's objective is to not actually use it is completely retarded.

@_date: 2018-03-22 01:05:39
Oh my god! Why would you do this.  
@_date: 2018-11-21 03:56:29
You obviously do not understand currency.  It's not supposed to be an investment. It's supposed to be a medium of exchange. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 11:20:44
Speculation *and* store of value?  
What the fuck are you on about
@_date: 2018-11-23 01:37:13
@_date: 2018-03-15 08:15:10
Such value.  So much humanity.  Really changing the world here.  And by changing I mean polluting.

I'm not the one down 75% year on year my man
@_date: 2018-11-24 04:42:16
One honest person here 
@_date: 2018-11-21 06:19:43
Yep.  The fundamentals of it are complete bullshit !
@_date: 2018-11-21 06:02:06
I'm a CPA and a financial planner.  
@_date: 2018-11-21 06:59:54
No I just told you the fundamentals are bullshit.  
@_date: 2018-11-21 04:57:08
@_date: 2018-11-21 12:00:39
Yes you're inflation-proof when you're down 75%
@_date: 2018-03-21 14:39:18
Please reply to this comment with the actual number of transactions you've done with bitcoin this month other than buying or selling bitcoin.  
@_date: 2018-03-21 22:19:18
No they won't. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 08:15:34
All that money came from suckers like you.   
@_date: 2018-11-21 06:33:59
The money is backed by the government too.  
Bitcoin is just one of many cryptos.  About 1500 different ones from what I've heard?  All coins essentially printed out of thin air.  Totally worthless unless they're being used as a medium of exchange which they are not.  
@_date: 2018-02-28 07:30:19
good lord but why!
@_date: 2018-02-07 07:45:57
How exactly are your bitcoins safe?  How many people have lost all their money in dodgy exchanges, scams, frauds, losing their passwords, I mean it goes on and on.
@_date: 2018-11-21 02:42:38
Haha 4.2k support.   How do you come up with this shit?
@_date: 2018-02-14 03:25:52
Yeah I hate having legal recourse for crimes committed against me too.  It's tragic
@_date: 2018-02-07 07:31:38
If a bank runs away with my money I have legal recourse
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:47:31
Wow are you guys actually starting to learn why financial regulations exist?
@_date: 2018-03-22 04:22:01
Mate I'm sorry but you should not make financial decisions like this without consulting an expert.  First rule of finance is that if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. 
If you cannot afford a proper financial planner (you probably can't afford bitcoins either) but there are other services which can help you.  Even forums etc.  Make sure you consult them before you do any further "investing".
@_date: 2018-11-21 11:24:12
Enjoy your fake money.
@_date: 2018-03-21 13:58:51
Lol come on.  No one uses it as a currency.   
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:55:16
Why on earth would the government want to regulate a market that intends to subvert that government's own currency?  
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:05:01
Lolol warren buffet is just some old giy who doesn't understand the tech.  This is a revolution.  
Clearly a bunch of of 22 year old gamblers know what they're doing man. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 22:32:41
So is oil a currency now
@_date: 2018-07-06 02:29:50
"I want to use btc as a currency and not hoard it and try to onsell it to the next sucker at a higher price" said no one ever
@_date: 2018-07-01 06:31:14
Wow.   Millenials are really stupid. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:57:59
All of which are not in support of bitcoin...
@_date: 2018-07-01 06:41:53
Not a ponzi scheme exactly but it's still a scam.  Nobody's using bitcoin as a currency.   The price is based on hype alone. 
@_date: 2018-07-01 06:30:15
And no one is using it, what a surprise 
@_date: 2018-07-01 09:23:10
@_date: 2018-07-02 03:05:59
A lot of people like drug dealers, child traffickers, tax evaders
