newspeak. the left is the right, and the right is left, and everything u think is good, is good, and everything that falls out of your confirmation bias is evil. lol.


By decentralisation, not by a revival of a fascist Europe...

Plurality and decentralisation is key. Nation states is for a "in group", and is totalitarian by nature. Its about "controlling" the economy and territory,  and doing things for the "nation" instead of the greater good of mankind. Its about trying to create a monopoly of identity creation, by force, instead of letting people choose who and what they are supporting, by decentralisation.

Brainwashed American? The US is not a organizations that put themself above nation states? Illegal invasions?! Para military coups in south America!? That was the premise of the whole f country! Fucking lol!? We are not witnessing globalism against nationalism. That's what your overlords want you to believe pleb. What we are witnessing, is  divide and conquer. At its obvious it seems to work.. 


Like being against anything that is progressive? And trying to spin everything so it sounds like you are under attack? That's fascism. 


Again newspeak.  Confirmation bias is real. You just take words, and make up a new meaning for them. The parties in Europe you promote is everything you just said. They are open about being totalitarians..

I mean, I have pretty much the same political world view as Orwell, who was...a leftist.. pro decentralisation, anarchist... so...gtfo.. btw its not fascism if its left-wing totalitarianism.. that's totalitarian communism.. both groups fought each other in the Spanish civil war... 
If u cant see how Europe has been occupied since 1945 by the US and  the soviet union,  you're a fucking idiot. All because these nation states fought for their own interests, instead of the interests of the common man in Europe.

That says more about you then anything else... 


Still the best quality of living in the whole world... so ...

Dude. Pls. This logic is beyond me. This is new speech in its purest form. Fascists are fascists, not lefties. 
@_date: 2019-01-08 13:52:40


No, countries are not fascist yet(maybe Hungary?), it is complicated. But to solve these problems, we need more common cross-border agreements on how to handle immigration in the EU. Not less.

This guy sums it up better then I ever could. Pro bitcoin, ethno-nationalist, full schizophrenia. You really don't get what bitcoin is all about? Its about creating a world economy, it is about going around borders, and at the same time strike a blow against the ruling class, the bankers. Its about giving all humans the possibility to engage with the "world economy", not just the bankers. Its about the demolition of the nation state, and in the long run, replacing it with competing e-states/systems.

Yea and u sound like the kind of person he would have shot with a bullet to the head...  :)


Yea, you are not even talking about fascism. You are talking about aggressive neo-liberalism.


Mass immigration from wars we did not start. That the US started, because they are trying to keep their dollar hegemony empire floating..

Also ethno-nationalism.. and hatred against Europe.. the extended arm of t_donald..
@_date: 2019-01-08 10:51:34
So support fascists in Europe? Pls gtfo. You can be critical of immigration, which most parties in Europe are. We don't have open border policies. But to go full right wing reactionism is not the way forward.
@_date: 2019-01-08 08:31:19
No it's not. They are a small minority. It used to be decent. But lately it has just been a right wing echo chamber. Brigading the hell out of anyone who is truly critical of the system, and up voting anything with connection to the right wing populist movement that is sweeping over the West. I'm more of a "no masters no slaves". To me it seems like that sub is just full of slaves looking for a new master..

Now we actually agree. I was pro Trump for this reason. What u call "leftist" is neo-liberals. Centrists, who sell out public utility and fuck the working class people in the ass.. aka Hillary Clinton. In Europe, those people are not called leftists.. not that our left is so much better.. but better then old classic euro fascists.. believe me..
This sums up my view pretty much:
