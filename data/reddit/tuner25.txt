Yeah and neither did I claim that he said so.


Yes and he's wrong. As Switzerland is not part of the eu, they have very little to say there:


\- The euro actually got stronger in comparison to the swiss franc after the snb removed the 1.20 barrier.
\- If you consider how expensive stuff is in Switzerland etc, yes, the swiss have more money than others but it really isn't as much as you may think, especially if you go by median (and not average).
\- Switzerland definitely isn't a 'restricted first class zone', Switzerland has LOTS of tourists and immigrants.
\- As mentioned, since Switzerland isn't part of the eu, it's definitely very wrong that 'all monetary, political and ecnomic decision' are negotiated in Switzerland (and certainly those decisions aren't made by the swiss). The contrary is true, I think Switzerland depends more on the eu than the other way around. E.g. after the 'MEI' the EU cancelled the Swiss' participation in the erasmus program as a punishment.


The swiss franc isn't backed by gold.
Sure the swiss have much gold compared to the size of the country. But many other countries (usa, france, germany...) have way more gold.


No he really hasn't a point at all.
If you disagree please elaborate that point because apparently I don't understand it.

Switzerland isn't even part of the EU.
I don't think it's necessary to further counter his argument. What can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence.

It's actually close to 6% so you're off by a factor of 30 but whatever.

So, you are american I guess?

So, you live in venezuela? Bigger currencies (usd, eur etc.) have shown to be quite stable over time.
@_date: 2019-08-12 18:04:15
If you'd look at charts you'd see that it had started to flatten out. If you take the last 40 years its not that much actually. Some inflation is said to be good for the economy...
Edit: I didnt even say 'not losing much'. Read again what I wrote so you don't create a strawman to argue against.
@_date: 2019-08-12 17:47:08
Not fluctuating a lot. Not losing unexpectedly much value over time.

Like this?
@_date: 2019-08-09 08:08:51
That makes literally no sense. 
But yeah /bitcoin has become a worse echo chamber than /the_donald.

It didn't break out when you wrote it. But it did a few hours later. But then immediately got knocked back down.
@_date: 2019-08-12 14:41:53
Yeah, especially in terms of stability and dividends BTC is just KILLING it!!

Well we are in a short term uptrend, mitdterm downtrend and longterm uptrend. I obviously hope for the long term uptrend.
@_date: 2019-08-10 11:27:31
So he isn't allowed to change his opinion?
You guys are saying 'he is against bitcoin so he has to be pro bitcoin' - seriously, how much can you twist reality to make it fit your narrative?
@_date: 2019-08-05 22:20:33
One pixel off doesn't change anything. Fact is, we are in a short term uptrend, mitdterm downtrend and longterm uptrend.

Please show me the 20-40 years span where bitcoin had low volatility.
My point is that comparing the venezuelan currency with the usd/eur is about as stupid as comparing a random small shitcoin with bitcoin. I guess we agree on that?
