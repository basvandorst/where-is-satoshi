Hey thanks for the replys :). I'm not really a fan of glossy/bling/sparkly colours.
 I initially wanted this  but paying 25$ for postage for a sticker is a joke, I decided to get this instead

Nice to see your support for bitcoin :), an interesting speaker concept, I think it would attract more love if the sound produced was louder so it could actually be used at a party to impress friends.
Also the design really needs to be polished up to look better; i.e. use plastic to make it look more stylish, align the screws properly (don't make it looks too cheap, a smooth metal probe would look cooler) and possibly have multiple plasma bolts. People would be willing to pay a lot more money for quality.
But yeah, take what you will, that's just my 2cents.

Fix up your prices. No way in hell would GoW2 for X360 would be worth 4.98 BTC at current exchange rates.

The cafe that use to accept bitcoin is called Cafe Biscotti, I heard they stopped accepting it when the employee that managed the bitcoin funds on his personal ipad ran away/fled with the bitcoins. I think businesses that are trying to startup with bitcoin should have a quick FAQ's site/introduction without having to go on reddit and spend time researching on the best way to setup.
 An example would be new merchants can try coinbox, have password protected wifi, should not rely on staff's personal ipads, use a qr code on a lcd screen in their store (proves the qr code is theirs; there is no fake qr sticker ontop of their own.)
