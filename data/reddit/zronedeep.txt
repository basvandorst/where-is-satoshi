Why should you need to own it to talk about it? Pressing buy doesn't make you more educated than anyone else. Some would argue it actually indicates a lack of education.

There is value. The black markets like SRO proved this. The issue is that currently utilization is really low. Doesn't mean it always will be. It might fall a lot lower or it might not. One thing you can be pretty sure of though is that it likely won't fall to 0.

I'm confused. I signed up for coinbasr and bought coins which I can send within like 5 minutes.

I think around 1500 will be the floor based on historical data. Could be wrong but if it hits anything below 2 I'm gonna start DCAing because I believe there will be enough money available for investment to spike the price in response to any upward movement or piece of good news. Id be willing to risk 10k in order to potentially see a 2x+ increase on my investment. The lower it goes the less money is needed to move the needle substantially.

The writing is terrible. Typos everywhere. Not a good way to get people to take you seriously. If English is not your first language at least have it proof read by someone. Not saying I expect next level writing but cmon.

This is my exact sentiment. Even if you're a believe just holding during a 90% crash is insane. Short that shit and increase your holdings.
@_date: 2018-12-08 01:17:10
The people who say it's a currency should be happy about the crash because the speculative bubbles destroy any use it has as a currency due to nobody wanting to spend it.
Back in 2011-2013/14 the doubters were all basing their doubt on deflationary spiral and everytime the price spikes they gain more legitimacy because the screams for HODL go up.

I don't need to Google search because I know what it means you're just dumb.

Do you know anything about trade charting or shortselling? If not go watch the YouTube videos posted around here recently they're actually really good. It's called something like "day trading for beginners (for free)..." dudes YouTube name is cottoncandyta. 
If you can't find em let me know and I'll get you a link. After that start practicing scalping and day trading altcoins. You can make (or lose) way more on the market movements for the foreseeable future than you likely can on BTC and if it ever starts to recover just DCA into it.

I'm more of a shortseller than anything so than current price is really irrelevant to me. Saying this so you know I have no dog in this fight. I've been watching bitcoin since 2011 and I watched the actually spikes happen around the fact that volume was being pushed by actual real world use. Yes it was illicit use but that's not relevant. It was a proof of concept and 100% demonstrated real value in self-controlled untraceable currency. Bitcoin is no longer so anonymous but it's still the main way to acquire other coins which are so it still will move. Where that value actually Is? I have no idea because there is so much speculation moving the market but to say it has zero value is just wrong. Is the value greatly overstated? Yes. But it's not 0.

Btc desperately needs a replacement for the black market. While all the old money was saying "haha bitcoin that's for terrorists!" They were secretly buying it up because they saw the utility being demonstrated. 
The HODLouts aren't necessarily wrong about their strategy (except that even as a holder you should he shorting the giant crashes to increase your holdings). But its reliant on others actually using the damn technology. They're basically buying it, and then asking you to start using it so they won't lose their money. Which is funny because if everyone does that then everyone loses their money.
The only people halfway making sense are the early adopters who already sold to cover their buyin or more. Even then they don't understand opportunity costs and a lot of other stuff but I won't fault them for that I'm still learning a lot myself.
I'm rambling so yea point being without proof of concept (which contrary to the vocal derision is actually what brought the money in) BTC can only reliably go one direction. 
It might jump and fall based on news cycles but HODLers wont ever profit from those movements so it's irrelevant.
On a long enough timeline the survival rate of all currency which isn't used as currency drops to zero.

There is no way grown men talk like this lmao

It's either gonna hold here or drop to around 1500. If we can't hold above 3k it's gonna nosedive. Honestly could go either way.

You just have to plan all your purchases on a year long 18 month or so cycle. Don't blame the coin for your lack of planning.
@_date: 2018-12-08 01:34:51
I don't think you do. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 00:58:54
I can agree to that.

You're missing the heavy HEAVY sarcasm haha

It's value is in the belief of its traders that it will sustain a large volume making it worth speculating on more or less constantly.
