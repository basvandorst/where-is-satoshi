Well as I say, I'm on neither side of the argument, but I read the good and the bad and this video sums up what it could turn into.
As the first rule, whatever digital asset is classed as the 'one' that succeeds, its needs to be decentralize to keep it from the hands of the corrupt manipulating power and markets.
I want people to challenge the videos opinion? We need serious discussions, not just patching up holes on a sinking ship...

Thanks for your answer, you really know your stuff!! But..
Technically if the Governments wanted to shut down Bitcoin though, they could SPAM the network slowing the blockchain down to a painful speed... it wouldn't be the first time they would throw money away to kill off a competitor (Communists?) - and at that point the LN still runs into the problem of mass adoption.
currently there is 7.5 billion people on the planet, of which, 1% would be 75 Million.. so lets say around 20million people are in on cryptos right now (less than .5%), if Cryptos gain mass adoption and reach 5-10 or 15% increase, Bitcoin will REALLY struggle.
If it wants the same adoption as VISA or Mastercard, Bitcoin won't be the answer as it currently stands...
And again I hate Bcash (Bitcoin cash)

I get that the video is a LAYMANS video... but it does bring up an important point regarding 3rd parties like banks or big money getting a substantial hold on the bitcoin market... nobody has addressed if this is possible on here? from what I see and have read, it looks totally plausible?! Can someone disprove this?

But wait...Why are you saying this? 
Honestly, he brings up some silly points, and uses ODD language to describe stuff, but essentially is  a very good point, if everyday people have their funds locked away, intermediaries will eventually see an opportunity to step in as a 3rd party to 'float' the customers currency (a bit like visa does at the moment). - at that point the majority of the system is propped up on corrupt bankers and big money...
It's a serious problem that is again just as important an oversight as scalibility in the future... these errors NEED to be strong and secure for decades on decades not just every few years..
It makes me question a lot of people who say "He's spreading FUD", where they're loyalties are? do they want change from a corrupt banking system or do they just worry about the amount of profit they could make in a defunct crypto before it all comes crashing down??
(I own NO bitcoin cash by the way) I actually don't like it at all..

But it still allows room for the 3rd party Corrupt banks to be let in the back door to prop up bitcoin?... surely this isn't good enough?

My favourite part of Bitcoin 2015 was learning to use Bitcoin in London shops. Great to use it as a currency. I've also enjoyed teaching my work colleagues about it who are very excited about the possibilities of it. 
Merry Christmas and have a happy and prosperous Bitcoin  new year!!
