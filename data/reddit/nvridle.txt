You can go even further than that if you can get a hold of one. Why not hold silver and Bitcoin together at the same time and let Voltron form?

“For those who do view Bitcoin as a bubble, this model is actually helpful as it helps explain how people get from the point of not caring to buying - which is a key ingredient to any bubble and I think the last time I used this model was in 2007 regarding housing.”
I like how he throws this in there at the end in what was a seemingly positive article for bitcoin.

Mining hardware has been subject to patent manipulation. It is now changing and the mining hardware is getting spread out again. However data storage is subject to cost. Anyone running a basic node to verify the mining authenticity will never be able to afford the massive blockchain size if we move to larger blocks. Nodes will become completely irrelevant. Further centralizing things.

Yeah that shit leveled me hard. The amount of sleep lost and the depression that set in was a mother fucker. I’m ready for war now you weak handed bitches. Just try and get me to sell. My mom makes great food and I’ll happily go live with her again.

Fuck yeah man. My mom is the shit. Best food ever. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:30:04
Do you know about math? It’s a thing. Have you heard of “exponential growth”? That’s what large blocks do. They will quickly and absolutely eliminate any small mining opportunities. We’re talking about petabyte hard drives within an extremely short amount of time to handle the scaling at which we’re currently experiencing. Do you have the money and the bandwidth to download and process a petabyte sized blockchain in the next six months? If so good on you. Because almost nobody else does. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:07:43
This cracked me up way more than it should have lol. I’m so using this from now on.
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:23:17
The only thing that isn’t right is the overall understanding of how this thing works on a macro scale and people having patience. The best developers in the world are working on big things to make this work correctly and are keeping it totally decentralized. You must have patience young padowan. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:15:55
Please explain how an every day miner will be able to handle a 2mb, then 4mb, then 8 mb and so on blockchain with their home computer to power and secure this massive network as it scales to global capacity. I would really like to hear your expert analysis on this. I’m intrigued.
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:20:38
I'm so sorry for your loss. Truly. But Bitcoin didn't fuck his mind up. Money and the current system of slavery to the dollar fucked his mind up. Money is worthless. All he needed was food, water, shelter and good friends. That's all any of us need. He may very well have ended up just as depressed with all those millions and being alone with it without his friends and family in the same position. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:31:58

What’s the other side say?
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:52:04
Once again. You did not answer the question I asked above. And now I will ask a new question in regard to your recent reply. Do you really think the mempool won't fill up to the same levels it is currently at if we reach 2mb, 4mb, and then 8mb blocks with the current level of scaling we're at? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:11:47
aaaaaannnnnddddd you don't think the amount of transactions inside each block will increase as we scale forward? Have you ever heard of spam? Personally I'm going to trust the army of developers that back the core road map of bitcoin. Most of which are not associated with blockstream at all.

@_date: 2017-12-22 18:15:08
Nah not really, I was just being melodramatic for an effect. Looks like it worked. I’ve got a pretty good life and a lot of friends and family. Bitcoin is just my baby and I love watching it grow. No depression necessary. But you’re free to feel that way about the greed part. I’m a simple person with very simple needs. I’ve never really had money so I don’t know what it’s like to live any other way. I study music, make art, cook and laugh with my friends. I’ve been in bitcoin since 2011. I’ve made some money but have never really sold. I’ve taught classes on crypto multiple times and just love the tech. One thing I’ve told everyone I talk to about bitcoin every time, is that I would give away every single last red cent of bitcoin I have to ensure it’s total success. Because if it wins we all win. Period.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:06:33
Because i believe in bitcoin. It’s the original. Has no central point of control whatsoever. And if bitcoin, the main name of crypto, goes down then why will anyone trust crypto at all if they think they’ll be fucked in the long run. I have some money In other coins that I think have great utility but in my mind bitcoin represents a real change in the way we view our monetary policies.

Please scroll up. You did not answer the question I asked. I asked if you knew how the average small Scale miner would be able to handle the hardware and bandwidth to download, process and store the bitcoin blockchain as it grows exponentially due to the current scaling conditions at a petabyte sized blockchain level. Do you?

That’s exactly where we’re at now. But with only a very small fraction of the globe using this network. How do you suppose we handle the whole world using it with the same problems and then have the massive blockchain size alongside it? We’re talking insane data centers with the largest storage networks you can imagine. Who can pay for that? Only a certain few companies that will absolutely control the direction of the network. I.e. centralization.

I understand why centrally controlled Blockchains aren't necessarily a concern for Bitcoin since its Blockchain is above and beyond what anyone else has or will have concerning hashing power and decentralization. I am concerned about most of the mining power of Bitcoins Blockchain being in China. Hypothetically speaking, Couldn't they (Chinese Government) force the farms in China to switch their machines to their cryptocoin and abandon Bitcoin? I know that wouldn't kill Btc since every other miner would just take over. It would be a mess at first with the hashing difficulty but eventually it would even out. But I'm curious as to what the next "China ban Bitcoin" (most likely for real this time) would do simultaneously. Anyway, I'm not a techie, just a long time Bitcoiner, so I'm probably sounding like an idiot right now. But curious nonetheless.

I'm glad he's ok. The first video I saw about Bitcoin was one where Amir was giving a lecture about it to a bunch of suits (I presumed they were bankers, and Amir himself was actually in a button up shirt believe it or not) in early 2011 and I enjoyed his presence in the ecosystem for quite a while before flew off the radar. Whether his views are agreed with or not, he's definitely one of the most passionate people in crypto.

Gold prices up to $4500, silver to $600 or more, Btc to spike after we break $1300 and totally explode in 2019. It's a good report, I suggest watching all of it. Some pretty wild predictions and allegations but even if only one of them are right 2017 is going to be insane.

We very well could be in a gigantic housing bubble currently. Either way it's a gamble. But I understand that a house is something tangible towards potentially  starting a family.

This actually happened to a kid I work with 2 weeks ago. He is young and not too bright but we love him regardless. He had a $600 purchase on PayPal that he didn’t remember making. He thought he must have just been really stoned and drunk one night. Nevertheless he reported it to PayPal, or so he thought. About a month later he got a phone call (at work) from a US marshal. He was on the phone for about 3 hours. Apparently there’s a whole crew of bad actors on the phone. Because he went back and forth from IRS agents, secretaries, sheriffs, the works. They told him that he was wanted for drug trafficking and money laundering in Texas (this kid is 20 and still lives with his parents mind you). So he was scared as hell. They got him to give them his social security number, the works. Eventually they said that he got his identity stolen and that they would help him secure his money by freezing his bank account so that the “fraudsters” wouldn’t be able to access it. So they told him to go and pull of his money out in cash and then go to a bitcoin atm and convert it and send them a backup of the private keys so they can keep track of the money just in case the hackers go after it. There wasn’t a btc atm nearby so they said to go get google play cards from the nearest Best Buy. He did this. By the time he finished all of this I had just gotten to work and we were all wondering where the hell he had been for 3 hours. He was all stressed from the run around but relieved that his money was safe (it was about $800 since he had just gotten paid and was getting ready to pay rent). He told us the story and we were all like, oh shit dude, you just got robbed. Moral of the story is, the state, federal, or any other branch of government will never call you. They will send you a letter with an official seal or come to your home address.

I'm sorry you guys are having a rough time with coinbase, but they are literally the only simple on ramp vehicle to bitcoin, ethereum and litecoin for multiple countries. Just think about that for a second. Really think about that. There are millions of people wanting in on this game and they all have special needs. Do you think coinbase can just hire thousands and thousands of people and without some sort of screening process to make sure they handle their jobs prudently? That's absurd!
Just think practically. This space is going viral right now. There's going to be problems. I've had my own with coinbase. Over time they get worked out. Just be patient. It sucks to miss out on buying and selling opportunities but this is what we have to work with for now. Blame the powers that be for making it so difficult to buy Bitcoin. That's the real problem.

This kills me to say because Bitpay has been my favorite company in the space for years. But unfortunately they've decided to fully support segwit2x (Hence the remark). Which means that all the companies that they process transactions for on the bitcoin network will be subject to only processing Segwit2x transactions henceforth if there is a hard fork and the companies they host don't switch their business beforehand. I met Tony Gallippi after his speach at the 2013 bitcoin conference in San Jose and absolutely loved everything he had to say. His contribution to the 2013 senate hearing which led to the massive spike of that year was IMO the most influential. I simply don't understand the actions as of late of so many of the most prominent early names in Bitcoin not reading between the lines with this potential hardfork. I know both sides of the argument. Core makes more sense to me in the long run.

This needs to be a little bit better updated unfortunately. Subway as a corporation doesn't accept Bitcoin, just a few locations as far as I know. Grooveshark has been dead for years so not sure how they will be able to benefit from btc. Those are just 2 that I know at first glance before looking into it a little further. We don't want the newcomers getting discouraged with misinformation. It gets frustrating when you go to a place that supposedly accepts btc and at the time of checkout they either don't or the person at the register doesn't know how. Especially if you're with friends (that aren't bitcoiners) and were just telling them about how excited you were to pay with btc.

Seeing how this is an open source project, how would one go about "firing" someone involved at the dev level which is totally voluntary. Granted I know that the core development team might leave to work elsewhere if they see this project falling into oblivion or absolutely getting taken over by better devs, but I also know that they really like this project and have made a lot of money helping it grow and aren't going to go without a fight. This is a volley right now. Don't underestimate the amount of users, businesses, nodes, miners, devs, wallets etc.. that are opposed to 2x. This will be tough battle. It won't happen overnight because of some hashing power and a large base of custodial control. Shit bcash is still hanging around and it has crap support and horrible hashrate.

I would love to think that Goldman Sachs is passionate about "Bitcoin" but let's be serious and admit that they're only passionate about profits.

That’s so gnarly. Really gives perspective to certain aspects of immigration. I think it really just shows the true colors of the game of fiat. China devalues their currency to keep trade dominant for their goods. The Chinese rich who basically enslave the poor to fulfill their profitable agendas then move their money as quickly as possible to other countries who’s currency isn’t constantly being devalued by investing in historically sound investments. I.e. real estate. Thus driving up the median price of real estate in every area they do so. How long until they short sell and conquer us all?

Hello redditor for 3 months :) 
I've been involved in Bitcoin since the early days and have been through the ups and downs and have for the most part extremely appreciated the narrative from Mr. Voorhees. I had the luxury of hearing his discussion at the 2013 San Jose convention and met him briefly afterward. I've listened to countless interviews, and articles that he's been involved in. And one article in particular which was his speech at the 2013 convention (I can't find the damn thing but this is basically the synopsis( really opened my eyes big time and helped me understand why this thing we're all involved in is insanely important to the whole world. Whatever you're  negative thoughts are towards him are based on the obvious current "Divide and counquer" strategy that's going on, you need to realize that he's a pioneer and wants this thing to succeed just as much as everyone else and has done A DAMN WELL SIGHT MORE than you have to help it grow. Do us all a favor and post some positive remarks and quit setting things in reverse.

@_date: 2017-07-06 07:34:59
I will have the same amount of coins on both chains. I'll hold both and the market will inexorably choose which chain is more popular and that chain will gain in value. Like it or not, that's the situation we're in. Every alt coin will have some sort of similar problem in time if they gain as much traction as btc has. This is going to be a looooooonnnngggg slow battle and eventually we'll get to a good spot in terms of global consensus. Cause let's face it, the current monetary system we have isn't so spectacular.

Dude... how long have you been involved in crypto? Cause I've been here since early 2011. This shit is nothing compared to what's gone down in the past. Nothing. The price is stabilized at an all time high and there is more investment from investors, devs, vc's, users, news, applications, wallet providers, etc... than there ever has been before. Just sit back and watch the show.

I can't decide which 2 year winter was more brutal. 2011 or 2013. They both hurt but I think 2013 hurt a little more because of the expectations due to such a massive price rise. But after 2011 everyone just assumed it was totally dead.

I just gave a long introductory class to these lovely ladies last night whom were all quite interested in learning about Bitcoin and crypto in general. I'm no Andreas, but I did my best to fill them in with the necessary information they need to get started. They had a lot of intelligent, viable questions and I did my best to give them the answers they needed. By the end of the night I got most of the basics laid down and had them all install a wallet on their phones and sent them all a little Btc. Overall it was a great experience and felt great to get new people on board. I don't know about you guys but I think it's starting to look like btc isn't just for the geeks anymore :)
edit: Thanks to and for bringing this up.
For context: I Ran into my neighbor (she's in the middle) at the grocery store a few weeks ago. She asked me what I've been up to lately and among the things stated, I mentioned digital currencies and she said "what like bitcoin?" And I said yep. This is her women's group and they had been wanting to learn about crypto so I gave them a crash course. It was great �� 
So just in case you weren't sure. They had already heard of it and were interested in learning more, I wasn't selling anything just educating. So it's great to know that more and more people are starting to get involved.

This is the kind of uninformed, get rich quick commentary that we don't need. I'm going to try and be the good guy and help all you noobs. I use btc ALL THE TIME. If you want to help it grow (and increase the price like we all do) then you should too. Use gyft to purchase gift cards to lots of retailers (yes amazon is one of them). Use purse.io for 5-30% off at amazon (yes, this is a thing. Look it up). Use overstock, newegg, tigerdirect, dell, microsoft, steam etc. to spend Bitcoin on products and services. Then, when you've spent your btc, buy some more to refill what you spent. This isn't rocket science, the more retailers see people using btc for their products and services and the more they save from not having transaction fees, the more network effect it will have and the more word of mouth will get around. Do your due diligence and learn about the technology you're invested in. It has a lot more utility than you realize.

Diversification is generally a safe and smart bet. I was all btc for years but have been dabbling in a few alts and precious metals now that btc has gained so much in value and I have some room to speculate. It makes it a lot easier to deal with the rises and falls of the charts when you're spread out a little. I suggest you give it a shot.

@_date: 2017-06-16 04:30:31
First I'll just say that I'm mostly invested in Btc and have been for a long time. With that said: This is why altcoins play an important role in this field. Whether or not China has some sort of strangle hold on Bitcoin or not, they sure as shit don't have a strangle hold on the rest. The cat is out of the bag and crypto is here to stay. These dinosaur mentality plutocrats days are numbered. It's going to be an ugly transition while TPTB go through their death throes but in the long run the people will emerge victorious. This has happened over and over and over throughout history.

I bought a night stand that an old friend of mine was getting rid of for btc back in 2015. He wanted to give it to me for free. I was talking to him About btc while we were loading the nightstand in my car and he accepted my offer to pay him in btc. I don’t remember what the exchange rate was at the time but I paid him like $60 worth. 
Fast forward to last December,  I was home for Christmas and we hung out. I asked him if he still had it. He did. It was up to almost 5k. Was I upset? Hell no. I was happy for my friend as in all reality, I had only spent $60. And that’s on btc that had already gained in value to me. 
This is how we spread adoption. If everyone just hodl’d then the newcomers wouldn’t be able to get involved. This is how the cycles work. People hodl, then they see real net worth come into their lives. Then they either spend or sell a percentage that they’re willing to accept parting with. 
With each new bull run we have a new group of hodlers that have gained decent wealth and are ok with parting with a little. That’s where the bear markets come from. But they level off, and then we have a new wave of new buyers that get in at not too scary of a price. 
Point of the story: bitcoin is meant to be used, not just stored away forever. Definitely Hodl, but when the time is right, spend it on something and spread the adoption.
