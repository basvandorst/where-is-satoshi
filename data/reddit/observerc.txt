Great job collecting and curating interesting data. Don't look back, start building a website to host this. Present it in a pleasant and intuitive way, this is great insight.
The most interesting piece of data for me was: 3,6 million addresses only. Given that most of the people control many addresses, really, it is only a tiny fraction of the world population that uses bitcoin. Really puts it in perspective. If successfull, bitcoin will still have to boom quite epicly, both in adoption and price, will be interesting to see where it is in  5 years or so.

Thank you for posting this. It is so true. Envy and hypocrisy are the answer.
Indeed this idea that all bitcoiners should hold hands and sing kumbaya it's absurd. It is money FFS. It has competition and desire for welth built into its very core. Why won't people accept that? It's not like we haven't be using money for all our lives.

Could you list available payment processors? If i am required top sign up in order to see then i won't.

Might well bounce now and move up.
@_date: 2015-01-15 17:42:07
Confused, why are you saying that? And why did you buy if you were so sure it was going lower? I take it you said whatever sounded most badass at the time. Well today is another day. Enjoy.

You should head up to bitcointalk and read up the comments about fees by satoshi himself.  You are wrong.  Even your last sentence is not necessarily true,  although that is unrelated.

Buying stuff online. I Was not happy giving away my credit card details to every online online merchant I buy stuff from. I have since been switching to those who accept bitcoin. The buying experince is much more pleasant and much safer.  I hope merchant adoption continueS.

Lol, wrong! it was not even a prediction of mine. But it's funny that it did bounce.
@_date: 2016-03-01 21:23:10
Why do you think that is not already happening?  old coins on the mempool waiting to be moved by the thousands. Just watch.

Most popular wallets have sweep functionality. I recommend copay. 
You sure you mean bitcore? Sounds like you are talking about the original client...? 
Either way,  you'll need to export the private keys. Or,  if you dont have many addresses expose them as qr codes as use the sweep functionality of your new wallet

Best comment today. 
@_date: 2015-08-25 11:02:38
Because their dev team is basically made up of developers from the original client which have been rejecting any alternative to whatever their views are. And clearly a huge croud is in favor of other views which are in their interest. 
Bitcoin is whatever the mining power and the ecosystem agrees on. Disagreeing on a set of views of bitcoin is fine, but if one side is eants to control the information channels and discussion spaces then people will give them a hard time.
@_date: 2015-08-25 15:39:40
Can that be because you do not have anything to say about the subject in discussion?
@_date: 2015-08-24 14:04:43
Wtf are you talking about? Commits count?  That is a very bad metric, but Gavin is certainly rabked above most (all? Dont care much about who they are anymore) blockstream gang.
The fact I mentioned is that Gavin and Mke did deliver a scalability solution. What have anybody else delivered? Where are the working alternatives?
How was this perverting the facts? What 'facts on github' are you specifically refering to? I am curiously waiting for a surprise.
@_date: 2015-08-23 21:58:27
Two core developers,  Mike Hearn and Gavin Anderson (which is/was the lead developer) went ahead and released a modified version of the original client which implements large blocks and a few other features.  is called bitcoinxt. The limit is still in place,  but whenever av miner finds a block using bitcoinxt, it publicly anouces on the blockchain that he is using bitvoinxt
 Four block have already been found by miners using bitcoinxt. If 750 of the last 1000 blocks have been mined with bitcoinxt,  a switch is flipped in the nodes to lift the limit from 1 to 8 Mb. If this never happens, well, nothing changes.
Other people opposes the limit raise and considers this hostile. People in favor of block size raise point out that this is giving people a choice and that the fact is that there is no working alternative for bitcoin scalability.

We don't have to agree on this,  we clearly don't.  I get the exact oposite perception. Most of those in team blockstream are those who, for many years, I felt were quick to pull their status,  and in a some ocasions behaving condescending.  While Gavin, Mike or Andreas have always focused on thr technical aspects in a more sober way.
Hell, look at the discussion now, it' bitcoinxt against something that doesn't exist.  The blockstream dudes really ought come up with more code and less blab if thry want some credibility. 
Also, Gavin and mike's bitcoinxt doesnt even activate if only less than 75% of the mining power  agrees to it.  Why being against it? It doesnt make sense, it is being against bip 101 is being against people being able to choose it.
@_date: 2015-08-23 21:32:58
Well, then you should remove the quote as he is explicitly voicing that he is against 'multi megabyte blocks'.

Thanks guys.  Keep up. I love mycelium and have used it for 2 years! The best!

The use is the one of a cryptocurrency that works with a nice user experience.
Personally I don't care about fancier use cases nor things like reference implementation. What the user wants is a quick, easy, reliable wallet in their phones. Full node usability is ultimately secondary. In the end, if any cryptocurrency gets really big, stake holders will be forced to put money on infrastructure. It's not up to the end user and the market to really worry about that.
I like ethereum's community and their focus on practicality. 15 seconds confirmations doesn't really offer more security, but it is more more apropriate to develop solutions on micro payments.
Where I think they failed is in the whole "it's not really a replacement for bitcoin, wait for the killer apps of the future". This was probably good marketing at first, but if they wanted to get somewhere they should aim for grabbing bitcoin's position and just go for the low hanging fruit which is simple transactions, many of them.
They are stuck into their dapp dreams and fail to tackle the easiest obvious problem. Then bitcoin goes up a little bit in price, already is in the top, why would people go for ethereum then?
They put themselves into this dead end. I own some ethereum, but I am nor sure I want to keep it either.

This is the right answer to that question, regardless the context.
@_date: 2013-11-15 15:15:43
can you link to an example?
@_date: 2013-11-15 15:03:27
Cool, so far my favorite option. On amazon there is a lot of people buying them together with actual stainless steel dog tags, so they should work. I'll look around a bit more and see if I can find a set with capitals and lower cases.
