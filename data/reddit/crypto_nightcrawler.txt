That's a pretty standard MO in China. They agree on a deal and later blatantly renege on it -- usually by trying to change the terms ex post facto and claiming those were the original terms. Anyone who's done any business there has been on the receiving end of that bullshit. I like the country, but the way they do business is fundamentally dishonest. Caveat emptor.
@_date: 2017-03-24 15:00:47
Absolutely. My node will not accept out-of-consensus blocks. However, if they deliberately attack the Core chain, then that's illegitimate.
@_date: 2017-03-29 09:05:37
That is not an accurate assessment of myself. I do believe that epistemic arrogance is a real thing, and that there is usually a lot more to things than the eye can see. If anything, it's mostly BU proponents who seem to be largely unable to grasp the far reaching consequences of what they're proposing (assuming they're well meaning, and that's a very big if). Based on many years of experience building distributed software systems, and using my personal and professional judgment to the best of my ability, I have concluded that supporting BU is against my financial interests and against the long-term interests of the most important invention to ever happen to money.
But you shouldn't trust me or anyone else for that matter. The beauty of Bitcoin is that it allows every network participant to decide what rules of consensus they're willing to enforce. Use your best judgment to determine what code to run. I am just tired of arguing with the same trolls, dispelling the same intellectually dishonest arguments and generally repeating myself ad nauseam. I wish we could always be excellent to one another, but we're only human.

What if you send a transaction to an address you don't control (e.g. a Bitpay address) and that also occurs on the other chain? Sure, you can preempt that by not spending your coins as long as there are two chains in existence, but that could take a while to resolve.

Alts have no utility past gambling. Even the DAO, which was supposed to be Ethereum's killer app, was completely borked and an abject failure. So what does Ethereum do again? I won't even get into how centralized it is.

You're pretty thick if you think this whole mess is about block size. It's about the governance of Bitcoin, and pushing through the concept of "emergent consensus", which is designed to give a couple of guys the keys to the Bitcoin kingdom.
When they decide to lift the 21M cap or something worse, I wonder how many useful idiots will still support them (that's assuming they're just dumb and unable to reason about long term consequences, and not just paid employees.)
@_date: 2017-03-17 21:32:32
Nope. That's not what happened. The "poison that split the community" was RV saying that the core devs "need to be fired" because "they didn't listen to him", and then leveraging that rhetoric to mount a social attack on Core. I guess he didn't get the memo that Bitcoin is not one of his companies.

It would be nice to have an interleaved PoW/PoS hybrid system, where one block has to be mined via PoW and the subsequent one via PoS. It would democratize Bitcoin and make it impossible for any one group to exert too much political pressure on the system.
@_date: 2017-03-13 11:39:50
It doesn't matter. It would take an extra few weeks for the original chain to retarget, and then it would be business as usual. Eventually the "honest" miners would start flocking back to the original chain, once they see that they're not making as much money on the BU chain (due to the fact that the economy majority doesn't accept it).

@_date: 2017-03-24 19:17:40
He's right. It's about giving the miners and a few people close to them the power to dictate the rules of consensus. Right now they're using the block size issue to seize power. And believe me, this entire mess is just a dry run for:
* banning various network participants and blacklisting addresses (Mike Hearn)
* lifting the 21M coin cap (Peter Rizun)
* destroying competing chains via hostile mining (Gavin Andresen)
The main pushers of BU aren't very concerned about high fees and slow confirmation times, otherwise they wouldn't mine empty blocks. It's just a wedge they're using to split the community and garner power. The real goal is "emergent consensus", which is just a fancy term for letting whoever owns the most hashpower unilaterally implement whatever change they want.
No intelligent person in their right mind would support BU at this point.
@_date: 2017-03-25 14:00:53
Yes, maybe they'll finally stop blocking Segwit and upgrade.

It's naive to think that a miner like BitFury (who is fiercely in the Bitcoin camp and who manufactures its own mining equipment) won't have miners on standby and immediately bring additional hashpower online.

I'm sorry for anyone who got shaken out today, because that's exactly what happened to me during the Hearnia (it was the first real hard fork threat and Bitcoin dropped like a rock in percentage terms that day -- today's drop to 9xx is nothing in comparison).
After that I put the rest of my coins in cold storage and decided to not touch them until one coin is worth $10,000. I don't care what RV, JW, China or anyone else does in the meantime. Either this is going to be a civilization-changing technology, or a failed experiment, but nothing in between.

I believe that cryptographic money is the future, that many nation states are irredeemably bankrupt and that we're going to see a financial crisis of epic proportions in the following years. Based on those beliefs, I keep a large portion of my net worth in Bitcoin. I treat it like an insurance policy and I don't plan on selling my stash until the price becomes an order of magnitude higher or I have something a lot better to put my money in. Price swings and market manipulations can't change my mind.
But you should find your own reasons as to why you should hold or sell. Don't listen to anyone who tries to sway you either way.
@_date: 2017-03-16 20:14:36
Anything is possible in the short term. In the long term, if you think Bitcoin is going to be a major success, you should keep your position. If you think it's a fundamentally flawed technology with no future, you should sell.
In other words, you should trade based on your fundamental convictions. Flipping positions based on short-term market movements and emotions is the best way to go bankrupt. I panicked and sold hundreds of coins at $200 when Mike Hearn threatened to fork the network with BitcoinXT and it taught me to never buy into the fud and manipulations manufactured by professional conmen.

Why not activate Segwit first, implement Schnorr and other compression techniques, and then see how much we need to increase the block size? Why do the least optimal "optimization" first? As someone who's been writing performance critical code for a decade, I think I know what I'm talking about.

Except it'll attract all kinds of criminals, fraudsters and conmen like Ver, Voorhees et al -- the type of people who only subscribe to libertarianism insofar as it helps them line their pockets and defraud people, and to help them create an ex-post justification for their actions.
Don't get me wrong -- as a pure political philosophy, libertarianism and its offshoots are great, but its real world implementation is unworkable due to human nature. I've noticed that most self declared libertarians are intellectually dishonest sociopaths with no regard for anyone or anything. They are the type of people who will do whatever is financially expedient and then attempt to justify it with "Well, the free market allows it".
So yeah, fuck "libertarians". Dishonest cunts, no better than the statist thugs who want to impose their will on everyone else and use magical thinking and "muh social contract" to justify it. Two sides of the same coin as far as I'm concerned.

Agreed. Core shouldn't do anything consensus-breaking, unless their hand is forced. The first camp to fork loses because they will lose their default chain status. Anything as controversial as a PoW change is justified only if we are attacked first.

From what I've seen so far, it'll predominantly attract delusional children who think they have shit figured out. It'll also attract problematic individuals who can't play nice with others, along with various conmen who defraud such naive types (socialism and other extremist ideologies suffer from the same problem, so this is not unique to libertarianism).


That's all fine and dandy until someone harms your interests then calls you stupid and weak in order to justify it: "the strong weeding out the weak", "natural selection just doing its work". When that inevitably happens (and things sometimes happen to no fault of your own), are you just going to roll over and say "Well I was obviously weak, Roger Ver clearly deserves to take my money, fuck my wife and kill me".


I think that's great. I share the same mindset. The problem is that as long as you live in any society, there will always be individuals and groups who don't subscribe to it. Almost everything is based on fraud and coercion, plain and simple. Political ideologies are simply a tool of justifying fraud and murder, whether a priori or a posteriori.

@_date: 2017-03-18 12:58:38


Most early adopters were predominantly western libertarians and cypherpunks. East Asian cultures have no notion of the decentralization of power, individual sovereignty, resisting power, and the concept of "natural rights" in one's life, liberty and private property. Bitcoin was created to help individuals achieve those things, and those qualities are what attracted many early adopters to Bitcoin. Not everyone was a moon kid with dollar signs in their eyes. Since China culturally doesn't understand those notions, it's easy to see how people like Jihan would overlook them and assume that money alone can dictate consensus.
If Jihan forks AND manages to take over the network, it will be evidence that cryptocurrencies are not a viable tool of freedom, i.e. worthless to anyone who cares about personal sovereignty. If profits are all you care about, there are much better and safer investments out there.

Anyone who's worked in IT/software has noticed that suits have a propensity for constantly overruling engineers and generally being smug and arrogant. That's how traditional companies and power structures work. The fact that and think this is some kind of company that they get to run is evident in the fact that they tried to "fire" the Core devs, just like they might fire an unruly engineer who works under them. But they miscalculated and got themselves fired instead by burning their reputation to shit.

In the real world such laws are needed because we are physical beings in a resource-scarce world.
Bitcoin is software and isn't and shouldn't be governed in the same manner. If you don't like a certain implementation, you can always fork. They did that first with their subreddit and now Bitcoin Cash -- which is excellent.
So what exactly is the problem? Just use your own forum/implementation/whatever. Trial by free market: if your idea is so great, it should have no problem taking off and garnering participants. Just don't whine when the world isn't doing what you want.

With a house you still bear the risk of fire, war, earthquake etc.
Not trying to nitpick -- just saying that risk is a fundamental property of life that can't be eliminated. People have different risk tolerances and different exposures in their portfolio. It's highly subjective, and what you perceive as a pure gamble, someone else may perceive as a sound investment (and from the way their overall risk is structured, it may well be).
So when you said it's a gamble and not an investment, you should have prefaced it with "In my case". Your statement doesn't universally hold true for someone who owns Bitcoin in order to uncorrelate their exposures, which is a strategy typically employed by hedge funds when they want to be beta-neutral (ideal scenario for them).

I'd be insane to keep engaging them, because doing the same thing and expecting different results is the definition of insanity.
Oh and this particular chicom has stated that he has 100M ready to attack the Core chain if needed. That's like telling me you're going to burn my house down if I disagree with you, but that I should still hear you out. Yeah I don't think so.
Eventually sanity will prevail and all these morons, criminals, communists, state-sponsored terrorists, fraudsters, closet totalitarians, and ex-convicts will move on, but that might take a while.

You know what I was trying to say, so semantics are irrelevant at this point. The fact still stands that you don't know how the normal distribution works and how IQ scores are calibrated, and why my original statement is of a tautological nature. You couldn't refute it, and you have an overblown ego and can't admit being wrong, so you attempted to argue semantics in order to not look like a complete idiot, which ended up having the exact opposite effect, and also demonstrated that you care more about preserving your ego than seeking truth.
I've seen your type before: semi-smart but egotistical know-it-alls who are more concerned with winning than with *what* they're winning. Their inability to get along with people eventually causes them to wreck their families, friendships, and jobs, so they end up living in a trailer park somewhere, driving a forklift in a warehouse for a living and crushing beer in front of TV every night (true story). Do yourself a favor and don't be that guy.

If the risk of an investment is &gt; 0, then it's inherently a gamble. Even government bonds, which are as risk-free as one can hope to find, sometimes blow up in your face. In that sense, every investment is a gamble. There's no free lunch; you get paid a risk premium because, duh, there is risk. Source: worked in finance.

Because it's much safer to build a larger faction that opposes SegWit using some kind of artificially created wedge like BU. Most non-Bitmain controlled miners don't have anything against SegWit and it would likely eventually activate or get dangerously close to the activation threshold, which Jihan doesn't like.
@_date: 2017-04-15 08:36:58
Miners mine Bitcoins because they have value. They have value because people hold them, use them and transact with them. Hashpower follows the economic majority, not the other way around.

It's not a conspiracy theory, I was just speculating in response to your own speculation.
Anyway, it's pretty clear that Segwit breaks something in Jihan's business model and that's why he won't support it. Whether you accept that fact or not is up to you. I am not interested in convincing anyone. Enough evidence is available for everyone to draw their own conclusions.
@_date: 2017-04-15 08:24:38
You can be sarcastic all you want, but in all seriousness, the probability of BU happening is close to zero. Same can be said for SegWit at this point. Looks like a stalemate. Works for me. I'd rather have Bitcoin stay immutable forever, as opposed to letting that shit eating moron Ver control it.

Absolutely. Many SPV implementations will switch to the longest chain automatically, since they can't verify the block size (and a few other parameters).

In the case of a bank account, the bank owes you money because you decided to deposit it with them. Nothing forces you to do that. You can still save for retirement using gold, Bitcoin, land or any other asset type with no counterparty risk.


Except equity is not debt - that's why it's called *equity*. It's literally a stake in an enterprise, which you could have built using no debt. I built a company last year using my own time, skills and efforts and I am the sole owner. Who exactly is indebted to whom? Does the company owe me anything? It most definitely does not, just like a house you build using your own two hands owes you no money: it's property. Equity is an asset, not a liability.


Why? Let's say I home school my kid and don't depend on society in that respect. Where's the debt?


Only in theory. In practice, there hasn't been a single society that has managed to pay off its debt, ever. The temptation to abuse the institution of debt is too high and impossible to resist for the political class. When the societal debt gets out of hand, it usually gets erased via some combination of war, inflation, currency crisis, mass murder etc.

Not trying to spread FUD or engage in armchair economics. Decentralized software is definitely the future. But I don't believe that the future is completely stateless or that any advanced society can be truly stateless because you will always have focal points where power converges and acts in the capacity of the state.
IMO the best possible system is one where statelessness and the state are in a constant struggle against one another, always rendering each other slightly impotent, preventing corrupt bureaucrats from controlling our lives on one extreme of that spectrum, and Roger Ver and his mafia doing the exact same thing (and justifying it with "The free market allows it")  on the other.

Social contract is definitely a hardcore scam but it has achieved results so far and produced at least some semblance of civilization. My worry is that if you got rid of it, things would blow up on a major scale until they renormalize and find a new equilibrium, and that's a big if -- remember that 50% of the population has a sub-100 IQ and many don't believe in living peacefully and respecting other people's bodily and material integrity. The problem with many ancaps is that they're very smart guys (usually engineers and businessmen from what I've seen) and they don't realize that most people don't operate on the same level.
Further, I don't think it's possible to have a truly stateless society because statelessness itself does not seem to be a stable equilibrium. You'd probably end up with rich guys creating private armies and making territorial claims, eventually morphing into kings and feudal overlords. Then it'd take another couple millenia to turn these autocracies into democracies. Just imagine living under Roger Ver. I don't purport to have a solution, just thinking out loud...

That's a very solid line of reasoning but you didn't follow it to its conclusion.
Gold may not be chemically mutated, but the perception of its value in the minds of people is completely alterable, i.e. it can be demonetized by changing culture and convincing people to not accept it anymore. A near-complete demonetization of gold is exactly what happened with the introduction of central banking in the 20th century.
So gold reduces to being mutable after all: not chemically, but with respect to how it is perceived as a form of money.
This leads us to conclude that:
* money is a societal construct and value is a purely subjective phenomenon that exists only in the minds of people
* no money can ever be safe from demonetization (at gunpoint if nothing else)
