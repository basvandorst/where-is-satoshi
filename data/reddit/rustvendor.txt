I definitely wouldn't include NEO in there

I agree that we have devastating systemic problems with the state and in particular the police and especially their lack of real oversight.  That is a HUGE problem.. Maybe I just can't wrap my head around how it would actually play out i.e. why would competition necessarily make it better.  It would seem that the machine would be too big and it would be a much larger and inherently bureaucratic process than just being able to fire your local cop.  I am also more of a pragmatist than an idealist and that's largely coming from where I live which is made up of a meathead populous that I don't fucking trust to make good decisions. I just think we are a long way off from the public even aproaching the idea of themselves being actually responsible for the world we live in.

Yes you are absolutely right about what we currently get for the money is not only a ripoff but downright dangerous to the citizenry.  I suppose I am just not sure how a private alternative would be better.  What I mean by discount goods and services is that if we have an open market for LE that the vast majority would be paying as little as possible (just like their car or health insurance) and therefore the vast majority of these private firms would be of that type and while it can be argued that car and health insurance is indeed a societal issue, I seems that due to the power they wield, cheap private LE would be as bad or worse than what we have now.. I would love to be proved wrong though because the current state sucks.

How would that not result in people buying the cheapest piece of crap LE available?  That's what the free market provides, discount services and goods.  There are few people that want things to work better and many people that wouldn't be able to afford law enforcement.  I lived in a neighborhood in LA where the neighbor hired private security to watch the street, the rent a cop was very upfront that he wasn't there for us.

you know what? my dad was a programmer and likely would have understood that creating a backdoor would have allowed access for the riff raff and undesirables. I regret making that accidental analogy..

Thanks dad :/

Anything is possible I suppose, but the fact is that Bitcoin is super easy to steal or erase your wallet file etc. and the whole point is that it requires a lot of personal responsibility/autonomy. I consider myself pretty well versed in technology but I've erased a wallet file with a hundred bucks in it before.

I employ a Peruvian sheepherder that has a visa and all that, and I set him up with a bank account and I regularly take him to the MoneyGram to send money back home. He can't do it by himself even after most of a year, I got him a smart phone and he is constantly fucking up the login on the bank app that allows him to check his account, one time he even erased the app completely. He hands it to me all the time and says it doesnt work and I have to enter the login and password which I made him write down several times. Bitcoin is completely out of the question.

No, I forget exactly what I did I think I reinstalled the Bitcoin program and it overwrote the wallet file. Pretty dumb

Yeah I'm just saying that non tech savvy folks are gonna have a hard time with Bitcoin, and it therefore has limited application in trying to subvert money sending laws.

I don't know what's simpler than contrasena goes where it says contrasena and id goes where it says id
