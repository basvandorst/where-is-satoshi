The way I figure, even in the States when they know that BTC is used daily for DNM/illicit purchases (although not primarily now) and the government couldn't touch it,  they can mouth restrictions and bans all they want, but the ship  has already set sail..   they should be figuring how to jump on board and start researching the tech instead of banning  everything... but, they don't want to risk losing the control over people via wealth... it's all they have.

This is seriously my life.. but now it's not just my woman.. it's her parents, my parents, all of my friends that aren't in crypto... I recognize that sigh anywhere!  I just keep talking though cause I like to hear it.

This happened a month ago or so... You can see by Bitcoin going down and Bitcoin Cash going up that the price together is near the $20k Core was at...   Bitcoin Cash will pump trying to exploit the difficulty adjustment, Coinbase news, etc...   and they will keep pumping, but at some point the price will drop out and then Bitcoin Core will jump back to $19/20k    Last time I tried to time this and lost my ass, this time I'm trying to be more cautious and setting up stop-losses.   I'd try and buy the Bitcoin Core dip!

.026 btc-  If I would have "hedl" it instead of blowing all the coin I've purchased over the years I would have 10-15 coins..  About to buy 2 coins though and take offline and give to a family member to keep for a few years atleast.

get your private key/password/seeds tattooed on a covered part of your body.  Go ahead and show them how to deal with bitcoin now, and then just let them know if anything happens to you how they can get your codes to access yours.
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:53:05
I totally agree!  It is awesome!  But honestly I would wait until the correction to buy, and then wait for it to jump back up to these levels.. It ALWAYS has done this. Atleast since I've followed.

I did the same thing earlier because I started to panic when the price dipped on a 10k transaction!  is where I went and used their accelerator... no shit I paid $97 to speed it up, but it worked and had the money to it's destination in an hour  ( I sent that big transaction with a $6 fee)
@_date: 2017-11-23 05:00:29
I fairly recently got a Bitpay Visa Debit Card and it's handy as hell! Plus the fees seem really easy to live with... you should check it out...  I hate tapping into my base investment money and haven't yet.. but I usually spend some of my profits here and there by sending the Bitcoin to my Bitpay btc address and it instantly adds the current market value of the btc to the Visa.  Bout to pay for all of my families Christmas with profits this year! 
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:20:26
I was planning on having my finger on the trigger of $7k to sell... unfortunately that's the downside to storing on trezor... watching the price fall as I'm still waiting on confirmations to get from trezor to an exchange... now I'm thinking I missed the profit boat to sell and gain a nicer position
@_date: 2019-06-23 00:50:45
This is correct.  I bought some just a few days ago via bank account and it locked in at 9k but can't withdrawal it from there yet.  I can however trade for another crypto they offer or sell it and take my profit.

I bought a badass gaming laptop last week with Bitcoin... $1,400 at the time will probably be a $10,000 laptop in the next year or two but oh well wanted to spend some of my profits.

I think they are suggesting that someone come and use their farm for a mining set up.
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:27:31
Yep, it appears that way... lame as the price is on the move up and I think I'm ready to take a bit of profit
@_date: 2017-09-13 22:53:37
I took at loan out of my 401k to buy 2 BTC.  Luckily it just showed up around this dip. I put myself back on a 2 year repayment plan to myself/401k with 6% Interest.   Dumb?  Possibly, but The amount I pulled from my 401K is a very miniscule amount of what is in there.. so if it loses, it loses.

  Darkweb is still mainly fueled by bitcoin.  But I'm sure if we looked at the history of every 100$ bill in circulation quite a bit would have been used for drugs at some point as well.

1.24 btc and about $500 in alts.  Hodl!
@_date: 2017-09-12 12:23:21
Thank you very much for this information! I can't believe I have forgotten to do such a thing when I have so much money tied up on the exchanges at the moment. The future me thanks you.

You can look at the history of the transaction. I went through my last five purchases to keep a log of what I bought the coin at and where it is now to keep track of profit made on coinbase and what they say is true.  Price locks on Click. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 19:43:07
Good job!  Today is my first day to own my 1st full 1 bitcoin as well.  Been throwing in bits of money here and there until now. Shooting to own 2 by end of the year.
Good luck to you!

bitcoin is still the primary... monero is gaining popularity though, but I'd put it at 80/20  btc/monero
@_date: 2017-10-10 03:05:55
it's expensive as hell, but you can buy those gift cards at walmart or one of those type places and find someone to trade it to on local bitcoins for an instant trade...  Before I got verified and all set up on Coinbase and the few other places I buy from I did this...   I would only do this while waiting to get verified on coinbase dude!
@_date: 2017-09-11 03:34:48
I have always been wary of this because of this reason.. had a friend see my posts and get hyped and buy in... in went down $200 in a day so he freaked... 2 weeks later it doubled... I made sure to call him.

Goto coinbase.com and sign up.  Add your bank or debit card, and then add Auto Purchase Intervals.
It's not the cheapest way.. but it's definitely one of the easiest.   I buy $100/paycheck this way.

@_date: 2017-09-06 03:13:56
When I create a transaction it instantly shows up on the blockchain...  at the current time it may take 20 minutes to confirm... but really when I use my debit card it sits on Pending status for 24 hours before it is "confirmed" as well...           But like others said as well... we are at the ground level of this.. new things are being developed at a HUGE rate right now...   we will get there in time!
@_date: 2017-09-02 19:25:04
Local bitcoins.  Lots of deals to trade giftcards for bitcoins...  You pay higher rate, but no ID.

I'm planning to hodl and continue to add small amounts each paycheck and then only dip into it when I can take 10% or smaller sells of my stash to cover my whole lives debts...   at this rate it will be a bit... I would bet 5-10 years.. but like I said only 10% at a time, then I will refill that 10% with more investments.
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:11:11
got about 1.5btc at the moment. Been upping my Bi-Monthly purchases though.. so hope to get up higher soon.
@_date: 2017-09-06 03:55:37
I wanted to purchase bitcoin twice a month on specific days so I set up purchase intervals on coinbase to auto buy 100$ worth of bitcoin automatically for me on those days.
I do the same thing with a savings account to help me save money. This is sort of the same, but WAY better interest rates!

I took out a 401K loan for 8k bought in at $4700ish... price started dropping, panic sold then waited and repurchased at $3000.   I set myself up to repay my loan within 1 year and the interest from the loan I pay myself/401k.  I have no regrets.
