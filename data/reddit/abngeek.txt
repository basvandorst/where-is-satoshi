From the DRK dev (eduffield) on the bitcointalk thread:


@_date: 2014-03-02 23:52:19
Because no other crypto really has any significant differentiation in feature or utility when compared to BTC that is proprietary and actually makes it worthwhile to use as an alternative to BTC. DRK does.
I'm not sure you've read up on what Darkcoin/Darksend actually are...

I don't claim to fully understand this, but I'll give it a shot:
Usually if you look at the asks and puts for DRK on Cryptsy, they're in ridiculous denominations that nobody would bother with manually, and there are dozens of them for the exact same btc amounts at different exchange levels.  My understanding is that this is done to try and obfuscate the "real" buy and sell orders, so that when people look at a simple ticker, for example, they only see the last buy/sell rate, which is low, but meaningless.
Couple that with the fact that, at this point, miners are assumed to be hoarding DRK on speculation (unless they're really stupid, because DRK is not as profitable to mine right now as many other alts, or even multipools for that matter).  Because they're hoarding, there isn't a ton of volume to begin with, so the bot can more or less have it's way at the moment.  Nobody sees the price going up or down a lot, so nobody is doing much.  
Personally, I've been dumping about a hundred bucks a week into DRK in addition to mining, but that doesn't mean anything in the grand scheme of things.  DRK has a very robust feature set that simply doesn't exist elsewhere  in alts right now - or in BTC, for that matter - and we think this will play out well moving forward.
I'm certain you could get a far, far better answer to your question on the bitcointalk thread though:

Where does one even start with this silliness...
* Darksend is not simple CoinJoin.  
* Highly customized CoinJoin (aka Darksend) is not the sole end-state anonymity component of Darksend.  Not even close.  
* Darkcoin is open source - the Darksend component is closed source until stable.
You really have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.

The nodes are selected randomly from the network, I believe at the end of each block.  Anyone currently logged in can find themselves in the position of acting as a node.  There is not one permanent central server (which can be compromised) doing all of the tumbling/mixing, as there is with a standard coinjoin implementation.  It would take a very large effort to compromise Darksend in any meaningful way.  The implementation also uses blind signing and standardized input denominations.  It's very difficult (impossible?) to link inputs and outputs.

Evan (the dev - eduffield) is very forthright and encourages questions and challenges in regards to how DRK works, so feel free to ask him any questions you may have.  The community appreciates it as well.
@_date: 2014-03-02 23:36:27
Someone claims to be.
@_date: 2014-03-14 22:24:56
Not until it's out of beta, but it will be.  Again from the developer:


@_date: 2014-03-02 23:43:17
DRK works differently from CoinJoin in that it is zero trust and decentralized, among several other things.
eduffield (the dev) has always been excellent when it comes to fielding questions and addressing criticism on that thread, so feel free to ask away.

For now.  It is one of very few USD/DRK markets out there - and the only one easily accessible in the US.

I'm very interested in hearing your point-by-point opinion on these flaws.
OP will surely deliver.
Any time now...
@_date: 2014-03-02 23:38:08
From what I gather the plan is to keep it closed for about a month after official launch, but the devs do an excellent job of explaining how it functions on the announcement thread.
300 pages though...

All of your transactions would still be visible to the public.  Using multiple wallets does nothing at all to help you in that regard.  All it means is that someone would have to figure out what your other addresses are, which would be relatively trivial.
That is not the case with Darkcoin (I don't know how Zerocoin works yet).  The transactions themselves are highly obfuscated.

There's a cut right after the reporter asks that question, after which it seems like he's answering a different question.

In case you're interested, he put out a whitepaper today:
