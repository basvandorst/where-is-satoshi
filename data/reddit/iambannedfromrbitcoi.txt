Yup, the censorship is real. The censorship on r/bitcoin has fueled the community's divide, since reddit is probably the primary place most people go to discuss bitcoin related stuff. Theymos and company have contributed to the rise of btc and btg, and many people have nowhere they can go for information they can trust. r/bitcoin has literally thousands of posts and comments deleted every month and r/btc sounds like a rabid hellhole. If the community's weren't so divided, we could have some rational discussion. Thanks Theymos for ruining people's trust in this subreddit and giving your opposition the credence they would never have gotten if their thoughts weren't censored here.

Bitcoin is money + cryptography. You can never be too careful. If you grow "coconuts" large enough to make you throw caution to the wind, those coconuts are gonna make you lose the race. 
And by the race, I mean that the finish line is hundreds of miles from where you seem to think it is. All those sprinters aren't gonna make it to the finish line. The engineer building a car from coconut trees is gonna be the one that makes it there first.
But to answer your question, the lightning network is already available on testnet. Try out Eclair:  or the lightning app:  . Within 6 months this stuff will be on mainnet.
