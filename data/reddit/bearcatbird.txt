Generational wealth is [mostly lost by the 2nd generation](
In a free market, wealth distribution doesn't matter because quality of life for everyone is increasing. The downside is that there are psychological hangups about large differences in wealth, even if your society is benefiting from it.
Capitalism isn't a perfect system, but it's the best system out of the options. I'm ok with a billionaire inheriting wealth. If she spends it stupidly on excessive consumption, the economy benefits as it moves those resources to people better equipped at investing. If she spends it wisely on investments in the economy, say in real estate, that also benefits society.

If you mine too much bitcoin, you risk affecting the early adoption of the timeline. So most likely he would have mined early coins (but not too early lest he risk being associated with Satoshi) and kept them in dormant addresses until he returned to the year 2030, which is when we'll see those funds move. These wouldn't be the same funds associated with Satoshi, because if those move it would shake the market too much. So there's a sweet spot in the middle.

Humans were all once cave men, starving and scrambling for survival. Now we live in a world of surplus with global poverty dropping by the day. There is plenty to go around, that is the benefit of human ingenuity + greed (incentive) + a system that maximizes its utility (capitalism). 
Populations in industrial nations are on the decline unless they allow immigration. As other countries continue to modernize and embrace capitalism, their quality of life will climb and birthrate will fall. 
More than enough for everyone to go around.
If you’re looking for dog eat dog, it’s called socialism. A system where people strive to work as little as possible while maximizing the benefits they can steal from their fellow man.

It sounds like you have a problem with the [division of labor]( but it has lead to all those wonderful things we all take for granted: antibiotics, food surplus, shelter, internet, transportation, etc.
If we stayed in simple survival mode, we'd still be wearing loin clothes and running around the jungle.
And if people "simply survived with skills they need to just...survive" they would forever be operating on the margin. Any unforeseen situation could kill them and their family...attacking outside group, disease, famine, change in weather, drought, etc. 
That's the benefit of the division of labor, it's insulation against the ravages of mother nature.
Also, even tribes without money still use money. Money is an abstraction from basic memory about "who owes who what". Once you hit dunbar's number, you can no longer keep track of who owes you something, so money evolved (out of a ledger system first) to aid in that memory process.

Most people don’t get it. That’s fine. I welcome the speculative mania. It’s a necessary part of the growth cycles. Meanwhile, bitcoin trucks along and evolves. Code gets better. Eats more of the world. Rinse. Rest. Repeat.
People whine like an old man yelling at the sky “Why isn’t this new technology doing everything I demand like RIGHT NOW!!” No sense of vision. No understanding of engineering. It’s fine. 
This works with or without their understanding. Later they will conveniently forget their ignorant euphoria, benefit despite their lunacy, pretend they were believers all along. It’s fine.

Before I get to my prediction...Bitcoin has always seemed like a [ratchet]( to me; it slowly moves in one direction, acquires some ground, stops to rest, and then continues once again. 
Who can possibly know with any certainty exactly how it will permeate through society? Bitcoin is a raw material whose potential we are only beginning to understand. We have excess imagination built on limited knowledge and any actual useful implementation is in scarce supply. It's a life form being built from the ground up, along with an entire ecosystem to support it, and it is far more intricate and game-changing than we can imagine. This is a deep, fundamental element we are dealing with and that type of power is going to have profound and permanent effects, touching every part of our world in ways we can't yet comprehend. From the outside it's going to be appear to be a slow, haphazard, directionless, complicated process littered with brief moments of fast, unanticipated change. But I think history will show it to be a natural and necessary evolution into a robust, new way to structure much of our society and how we interact.
And what will drive the ratchet? 
- Financial Crisis
- Third-World Development
- Ideology
- Price Bubbles Raising Further Awareness
- Institutionalized Money
And of course the mother of all wildcards
- Unforeseen Innovation
I agree that Bitcoin isn't useful or practical on a large scale for day-to-day payments (yet) or currency (yet) or gold (yet) or contracts (yet) or insert-anything (yet). The market cap is too small, the user experience too cumbersome, the old habits too entrenched, etc. 
But the ratchet-effect of bitcoin won't stop. It will keep twisting and tightening and pressing until the world has changed into something so alarmingly unrecognizable and at the same time quite wonderful.
Oh, and my prediction? Stabilized at ~$250 until next fall, stabilized again $500-1000 for 3 years. Any of this is completely useless though given the unpredictable nature of the drivers of the ratchet I already listed.

* His use of charts and the camera is clumsy and distracting.

Thanks. 
What about saying there's value in an address when there is not. Is there anything they could affect that would allow them to transfer 1000 BTC from a non-existent/empty address? If the answer is no because the protocol checks the values before transferring somehow, then is it possible they can subvert that checking mechanism?

Don't feel bad, everybody feels that way. I debated buying while Bitcoin was $20. Then when it was $100 I thought, man, I really need to get into this Bitcoin thing. Still waited. Lol. Finally jumped in after that and never looked back. 
I've dollar-cost-averaged through the last few years, buying high and buying low, buying extra when the price drops. I remember sweating buying at $700 and then it dropped to $500. In hind sight it doesn't matter too much. Plenty of people here would love to have that price, but at the time you are much less sure. Just dollar cost average. 
Buy a little now if you're worried. Then buy some more after the etf. No one can know the future so play the long game.

I like both these guys, but jezuz BK, let the man speak. 
Schiff is somewhat correct that Bitcoin is a speculation. Money evolves through multiple stages on its way to becoming a robust medium of exchange and speculating is the first stage. Somebody has to take a gamble on a new commodity and consider it valuable. That's inherently speculative. 
But Bitcoin isn't just speculative anymore, and Schiff only seems to think of it in that first stage. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is transitioning into a store of value. 
Schiff isn't thinking big enough. BK needs to be more respectful and learn how to debate. So annoying to listen to.

Yes and no. It's like a gold ETF. If you don't own it physically do you really own it? If they lose the Bitcoin somehow (hack) and have a clause to pay you back in USD equivalent, would that be acceptable to you? What if the price is skyrocketting.

I was a member of for over a year. I joined for the same reason you state. But I eventually left because they never really offered anything new. 
- They are wholly pessimistic about bitcoin.
- They are irrationally anti-segwit
- They are mono-visioned cheerleaders for BU
- They never celebrate Bitcoin successes or price jumps
Rinse and repeat, day after day. A year later I finally realized they weren't adding any new perspectives. Get news from other forums and news sites.
Also, I'm not pro-Core. But I've worked in software development for 15+ years on live systems and have seen enough critical-failure bugs slip through to know you don't mess around with this like BU is messing around.

Sounds like you don't understand how Bitcoin actually works. The coins are never stored in the trezor, the coins are ledger entries on the blockchain and your trezor only stores the keys to move those coins in the ledger. 
The keys can be regenerated using the 24 word seed. Even if someone has the same words as you, the order of the words also matters. Your 24 words have 19,621,680,704,813 potential combinations. 
See [this]( for more information.

Is there a technical solution to this? Why wouldn't more miners just mine empty blocks? Or does the game theory satisfy it? Meaning if too many miners mine empty blocks then the system fails and no one makes money. So self interest comes into effect. And  eventually the reward will be so small anyway that fees will be where you make money, in which case this empty block problem will solve itself over time.

Socialism/Communism are about equality and complete control of the economy to achieve that. Arachno-capitalism advocates free markets, not equality. 
Bitcoin is free market money, traded openly in markets to whoever wants to participate, and its structure is centralization-resilient by design. So it is definitely more ancap than anything.

Societies can take different approaches to influencing their economies. 
- They can take a more hands-off approach and allow the free market to work. This is generally viewed as capitalism. 
- They can take a more hands-on approach and redistribute resources based on criteria such as "the needs of the people". This is generally viewed as socialism.
If bitcoin has within its code deliberate structures that make the program function in a more free market way than socialist (for example, structures dictating the model of coin distribution, an inability to redistribute those coins once distributed, etc), can you not then conclude that bitcoin is more free market?
This doesn't strike me as an oversimplification. It strikes me as an acceptable observation about how a system is functioning.

Well there's the rub then. Your society can only exist on a new planet. Perhaps fresh land on Mars when we colonize. Even then, I predict it will fall apart for one main reason: human nature. Your system needs to take into account inherent biological behaviors, and socialism does not. (ex: self interest)






All subjective.
And because those are subjective, the best you can hope for is the most universal system possible that allows for a marketplace of ideas so the best solutions for the given society at a given time can be discovered and adapted. That current system is capitalism.


It doesn't. See [time preferences]( a naturally occurring human behavior derived from biology. 


Changes to the planet and society on a scale of centuries is no better answered by socialism, and I would argue is attempted to be answered in a worse way. So it depends on your axioms. If reduction of natural resources and species extinction is something you hold as inevitable given capitalism (which it isn't), then your conclusion would naturally be dire.

I think a lot of people mean well at thanksgiving and relatives who don't see you that often are just trying to find a way to connect. Bitcoin might be one of the only things they remember you're into.
Unfortunately, in my case their approach to the topic often isn't the most innocent or friendly. Family relationships are complicated, there's a lot of [schadenfreudeu]( and envy - depending on where the price currently sits. Even then, it isn't black and white.
So what should you do in that situation?
In my experience, it helps to keep things somewhat superficial and up-beat and resist falling into any arguments. If the relative is well meaning, they usually get interested and ask followup questions. If they aren't well meaning, you've kept things cordial enough and haven't engaged too much. You don't really know the motivation for them asking, so keeping things light at first is usually the best tactic. Usually the topic changes, so there's no point getting too deep right away.
This thread is mostly an informative one for new people spending their first/second thanksgiving after getting involved in bitcoin.

If the bitcoin code was updated to redistribute all the coins evenly among all addresses it would still be code, just as you say. But the expression of that code would have results more socialist than capitalist.

Sounds like he speaks in vague terms so you go look at his report for the details. But here's what he does say:
* Bitcoin is harder to manipulate than Gold/Silver because it's traded 24/7, so the price is more accurate to actual market price.
* Something big in China will happen Jan 9-12 with Chinese populace, not Chinese banks.
* New internet project later this year running into rural China will bring online a billion Chinese, and bitcoin with it. (Whether bitcoin has a direct connection I doubt.) He alludes to some way that goat farmers (as an example) will be able to use bitcoin. (This might just be wishful thinking.)
* Trump euphoria is reflected in equities but not in bonds and derivatives. Bitcoin price is the only un-manipulated metric as to what is going on in the global economy. 
* Fear will drive people into bitcoin and since it can't be manipulated down, the price will sky rocket. It can't be held back.

World governments are in the midst of a currency war. China and Russia have good reason to support bitcoin - it undermines USD hegemony. The enemy of my enemy and all that.
Also, bitcoin may simply coincide with fiat and become a new wealthy industry. China leads in manufacturing and mining for bitcoin. They won't give that up without a fight. Russia has no reason to alienate themselves from a new source of economic growth.

Think of Bitcoin and blockchain as two sides of the same coin. That coin allows a very simple property to manifest itself for the first time: a global, immutable, decentralized, trustless, timestamped system of near instantaneous value exchange. 
Now ask yourself, given this basic property, how might it fundamentally change incumbent systems that modern society is built on that are also dependent on trust and value exchange?
That's what people are trying to figure out and then build. A lot of the ideas will be fruitless and fizzle away, just like the dot com bubble. But coming out of that will be successes that could change the world in significant ways. 
What are these ideas? Just search "Bitcoin blockchain" on YouTube to find plenty of ideas.

Betterment of society is subjective. The best means in achieving those ends, whatever they might be, is debatable. All though Capitalism currently has the best track record.

In general, you're right. Some edge cases where bitcoin is easier, like ordering certain goods from foreign countries or donating to legal organizations blocked by Visa/Mastercard. But for the most part you're correct.


Degrees of anonymity based on the capability of the snooper, but yes you're correct.


Yep, I do not disagree.


Exactly. Every investment is a speculation, the success of which depends on many factors including your understanding of the market, the prominent players, anticipating changes, etc. 
Buying bitcoin means you're speculating on
- Society's growing desire for a neutral alternative in a nation-state-dominated cashless society
- Society's growing desire for technologies that counter Orwellian tendencies
- Society's growing desire for an alternative to debt-based economies
- Society's growing desire for an alternative to hegemonic monetary policy
- A non-correlated investment to stocks and bonds and national currencies
- Bitcoin's ability to evolve thru-put that not only matches current money processors, but exceeds them by many orders of magnitude
- The new economy that might develop from this high thru-put technological advancement
- Bitcoin's ability to evolve privacy technology that will eventually bring anonymity
- Bitcoin's ability to become more decentralized and anti-fragile
It's a calculated speculation no different than 
- Buying Amazon stock in the late 90s because you see the potential of a digital books market and beyond
- Buying Apple stock when Steve Jobs returned
- Buying Netflix when they started a streaming service

Coinbase is fine for the most part just understand what you are using. They are basically a bank that tracks where you send btc (up to 4 addresses deep after it leaves their servers) I believe. And they most certainly tell everything you do to the government. 
That said, it's a good place to buy btc and a reasonable place to store btc if you're a newbie. But don't do that too long unless you are completely computer illiterate and/or not buying a lot of btc. 
Eventually you'll want to get a Trezor. The sooner the better. It's very easy and secure. I wish I hadn't waited so long to get one.

You should be extremely skeptical of all your assumptions and conclusions in all areas. This way of thinking is precisely why people study Austrian economics in the first place. 
Also, an economics degree does not mean you understand economics to any meaningful or productive degree.
Also, there is no shortage of historical examples where majority consensus was wrong.

Arpanet went public in 1972. That's a good 18 years (1990) at least before it started to become popular with the WWW, and another 9 years before it really exploded.
Bitcoin is in year 1981. 
Here's some interesting comparisons for fun.
- Year 1 (1972) - released to public
- Year 9 (1983) - Gets TCP/IP
- Year 18 (1990) - Gets WWW, enters public in a meaningful way
- Year 27 (1999) - I'm picking an arbitrary date, but it's exploding by this date.
- Year 36 (2008) - Internet is so obvious as to have ever been questioned. 
- Year 37 (2009) - Internet paves way for new tech, Bitcoin

Most of my friends (who aren't big into btc) just store on coinbase. $108 isn't very much so I wouldn't sweat it. If you start accumulating $1000s in BTC, you might want more control over the private keys. There are many reasons for doing this...your interests might change for what you want to do with your btc. Or laws might change regarding the legality of btc. Or coinbase might change their policies. Just think of it as physical gold. Do you want a company to store it or do you want control over it? Most of the time it doesn't matter but history shows us that sometimes it does. Just balance the risk however you're most comfortable.

On a more basic level, money is just an abstraction used to record-keep a history of value exchange. A ledger. 
So the best abstraction that comes along that can do that will be the best money, all other things being equal. 
Money doesn’t need intrinsic value, it needs fidelity, reliability, and to have the greatest ratio of value preservation - which all the properties of money (fungibility, scarcity, etc) play into.

When finance ministers and central bankers come to Washington this week, the International Monetary Fund has a message for them: Digital currencies are on your doorstep. Get involved.
“In the U.S., and other countries around the world, it is just a matter of time before we see massive disruption,’’ Tobias Adrian, the director of the IMF’s monetary and capital markets department said in an interview. “There is at least the potential that new technology might lead to a new global payment system fairly rapidly.”
The G-7 on Thursday will release broad guidelines for regulating digital money. They will also discuss whether central banks should issue their own. Adrian’s team is contributing to the report.
Central banks from Sweden to Canada and China are studying whether their money should have a digital counterpart. Sweden began an e-krona project in 2017 and has issued two reports on the topic. The Bank of Canada has launched a formal research project that has partnered with other monetary authorities. The U.S. central bank, by comparison, is focused on updating the domestic payment system to real-time settlements so money moves almost instantly.
The forces of change are coming from two, longer-run developments that regulation may slow but not stop.
Online Purchases
The first: Transactions are increasingly conducted online, and consumers and merchants want cheaper and faster payment systems. In the U.S. today, payments travel through banks and credit card companies, and along the way there are fees and delays. Those costs cut particularly hard against gig workers, immigrants, and low-income people.
“The American payment system is a giant reverse Robinhood, sucking billions of dollars out of people who live paycheck to paycheck and depositing money in the form of credit card rewards to the already rich,’’ said Aaron Klein, a fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, who is critical of the roughly five-to-six years the Fed says it will take to launch its own real-time payment system.
Credit card interest rate spread vs 'risk free' U.S. Treasury 2-year note
The second trend is a potent threat. Social media and online platforms like Facebook could create “stablecoin’’ currencies to facilitate transactions on their platforms. A stablecoin’s value is linked to some reserve asset and is designed to have less price variation than cryptocurrency.
Facebook Inc. has already proposed a global digital currency called Libra, which regulators are grappling with. Banks have also conducted their own experiments with stablecoins, such as JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.’s JPM Coin, which is meant to speed up corporate payments.
A financial system that is moving away from a bank-centric model of payments to one that is based on payment platforms, leaves central bankers with a choice: Do they want on their country’s money or somebody else’s to facilitate those transactions?
A system of competing currencies “is what the U.S. banking system used to look like in the 1800s, and we had repeated financial crises,’’ said Julia Coronado, the founder of MacroPolicy Perspectives in New York and a former Fed board economist.
But today the public is demanding simpler payment forms and the central bank should find ways to embrace that while protecting the safety and soundness of money, she said.
“The monetary authority must recognize the current system doesn’t fully serve the public’s needs anymore and some degree of disruption is inevitable,” said Coronado.

Fed Links
That’s a tall order for the Fed to accomplish without congressional backing or support of the banking system, with which it has deep historical linkages. And so far, the U.S. central bank hasn’t looked to be a first mover in the space.
The Fed has no formal digital currency research effort, though its economists are keeping abreast of the topic. It is occupied with the build out of its real-time payment system FedNow.
FedNow will compete with a private payment system run by banks that is already delivering real-time payments -- for a fee. It will also continue to work through a bank-centered model rather than a payment-centered model. In fact, FedNow intentionally strengthens the current banking model rather than disrupting it.
A digital currency “is really about the industrial organization of the payment system,’’ said former Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker. “The Fed has always aligned itself with the banking system, and FedNow is about preserving the privileged place banks have in that system.’’
Fed Governor Lael Brainard spoke about the costs and benefits of stablecoins and central bank digital currencies on Wednesday in Washington.
“Global stablecoin networks also may pose challenges to bank business models,” she cautioned. “In the extreme, widespread migration to one or more global stablecoin networks could disintermediate the role of banks in payments.”
Economists predict the Fed can’t wait much longer to confront the question of digital currency. That’s also the view of the leaders of the Bank for International Settlements and the IMF -- Depression-era institutions that were founded to help stabilize the global monetary system.
“It might be sooner than we think that there is a market and we need to be able to provide central bank digital currencies,’’ BIS chief Agustin Carstens told The Financial Times in June.
Privacy, Outages
There are plenty of things to worry about, economists caution. Big tech monetizes user data and it would certainly continue to do so if they got involved in payments, raising privacy concerns. Platform payment systems could easily develop into monopolies and help spread dollarization to other nations as merchants and consumers abandoned local currencies. Anything digital is subject to hacking, power outages and is naturally limited by access to technology.
Adrian, the IMF director, says central bankers often argue from the status quo when it comes to digital currency, asking, “What problem are you trying to fix?”
Mainly, it’s that payment needs are changing and legacy services are expensive and slow, Adrian said. As economists, “we like innovation and we like competition,” he said.
“That is the thing about innovation -- you don’t quite know what it is going to be used for,’’ Adrian said. “Did we know we would come to rely so much on our smartphones when they were introduced?”

Arpanet went public in 1972. That's a good 18 years (1990) at least before it started to become popular with the WWW, and another 9 years before it really exploded.
Bitcoin is in year 1981. 
Here's some interesting comparisons for fun.
- Year 1 (1972) - released to public
- Year 9 (1983) - Gets TCP/IP
- Year 18 (1990) - Gets WWW, enters public in a meaningful way
- Year 27 (1999) - I'm picking an arbitrary date, but it's exploding by this date.
- Year 36 (2008) - Internet is so obvious as to have ever been questioned. 
- Year 37 (2009) - Internet paves way for new tech, Bitcoin

I forget the exact nature of the technology but I believe some of the early coins are more susceptible to being cracked as computers advance, so they would be the first indicator that new tech has arrived. 
Also, the price is determined by exchange in the market place, not whether dormant coins will stay dormant. Though knowledge of that might influence buying patterns to a degree.

You're being snarky, but to answer your question, yes and no. I'm not saying to ignore professors. But it's important to think critically, plenty of professors are idiots.

Don’t worry about rushing to own your bitcoin directly. It takes time to learn and feel confident that you know the security. 
But eventually (within 2 years) you’ll want to buy a hardware wallet, set it up, send a tiny amount of bitcoin, and practice recovery procedures. 
- Are you storing your private seed in a fool proof way with fail safes? 
- Are you using a pass phrase? How is that stored in case you forget it?
- Do you understand how to restore the word seed? Have you done it a few times?
- Can you restore your wallet under various circumstances?
Practice all of those until you feel confident. Then start transferring over your bitcoin from Coinbase.

@_date: 2019-06-02 14:47:17
If 1 BTC = $1 million, then ..
- 1 = $1,000,000
- 0.1 = $100,000
- 0.01 = $10,000
- 0.001 = $1,000
- 0.0001 = $100
So if you buy .0001 BTC for $100, you're effectively saying the price of 1 BTC is $1,000,000 without actually spending the money.

Also, as annoying as it is in the short term, I'm not so bothered by manipulation of gold's price for the long term benefits. Here are a couple reasons.
1. It gives a reason for Bitcoin to exist and grow and evolve.
2. It's a valid attack vector and an anti-fragile sound money should ultimately be able to resist it. Let's see how well bitcoin does. 
3. If gold's price wasn't suppressed it would keep climbing, which is all well and good at first glance. But there are negative, unintended consequences. 
What happens as the price of gold increases? Previously unprofitable forms of gold-mining become profitable. And as the price continues to climb, more and more invasive/destructive forms of mining will be developed. 
Why is that bad? Beyond new gold mines opening around the world, and hunting for gold in the oceans and across every continent, you'll also get odd situations. One example is that there are [trace amounts of gold in top soil]( At what point does it become more cost effective to stop growing food and "strip-mine" all the top soil just for more bits of gold? 
Ultimately bitcoin just makes more sense.

The US prints so much money, it effectively doubles the entire money supply every few years. If we go by inflation as a rough estimate.
Satoshi has 1m coins. If bitcoin went from 21m coins to 22m, it wouldn't really matter *too* much.
2.6m bitcoin were mined in the first year of bitcoin's existence.
If satoshi sold all his 1m coins and crashed the market, it would recover in relatively "short" order.

One big difference with bitcoin though is the "hodl floor" - the growing group of people who buy bitcoin, take possession on the network, and hodl. 
I'm curious how that affects price manipulation going forward. Keeping the price low only creates more interest from hodlers who buy even more and take even more bitcoin into possession.
Eventually that lack of supply will manifest.

For the very reasons you listed. All the problems that stem from a lack of competition. It just happens to be a system that is the foundation of all other systems. So when it changes, everything else does too. 
Bitcoin is a threat to every aspect of that ecosystem, from monetary issuance to loans to payments to settlements. 
It sounds like we have different beliefs about the future of bitcoin. Luckily if we live long enough we will find out who is right.
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:46:23
Probably people more focused on development and news only hang out here.
is a catch-all melting-pot and a big part of why we are all here is the price. So it will inevitably be the case there are a lot of price memes. I imagine once we get past 10k, people will really only point out big milestones like 15k, 20k, 25k, 30k, etc, then after 50k, probably only every 10k (60k, 70k, etc).

@_date: 2019-12-12 15:31:28
Exactly. Bitcoin is an opt-in system. People will join out of self interest for many reasons. As long as Bitcoin provides values that align with that, people will keep coming. The state of the world economy ensures that people will find Bitcoin valuable.
@_date: 2019-04-04 05:21:43
It means this...
Anyone can broadcast a transaction to the bitcoin network, but there's no guarantee that it will get selected by a miner to be included in a block. The miner's fee you attach to your transaction determines the probability it gets included; miners naturally pick transactions with the biggest fee first because they'll make more money. 
When there are a lot of transactions, if your fee is small, then your transaction might float out there for days, weeks, months, indefinitely. 
But when there aren't a lot of transactions floating out there to get picked up, your fee can be small (even non-existent) and you have no trouble getting in a block. 
As more transactions are sent, a backlog builds up. That's the mempool.
Segwit helped reduce transaction size so more transactions fit in a single block. Not all miners are supporting that upgrade because they oppose the technology for reasons that I won't get into.
Some people think this problem should be solved by increasing the block size to let more transactions in. 
- The problem with this strategy in the short term is it's a quick fix at the expense of other, more efficient fixes. (segwit, for example). And as far as engineering goes - especially on a system like bitcoin that is global and decentralized - you want to be as efficient as possible before you resort to less optimal solutions.
- The problem with this strategy in the long term is that it has negative effects on node operators because the economic costs of operating a node increase - bigger block size means more bandwidth, more storage space, more processing power needed to verify, newer hardware to manage this, more electricity. 
If your goal is to keep bitcoin decentralized - one of the main tenets that gives it value - and that partly depends on node operators, then you want to incentivize node operators with efficient technology.

You can look at it from other angles. 
- What were the causes of past financial crisis? 
- How did each one differ from the next? 
- How are they related to debt? 
- What does the next crisis appear to be likely caused by?

There was an article a while back that showed a direct correlation between financial problems in various countries (Greece, India, etc) and a rise in BTC price. 
Also, if you're a gold holder the likes of Rickards, Maloney, and Schiff it's worth looking into Martin Armstrong's theory. He thinks gold will never again be 'a thing' and at most will rise to $5k if you're lucky.

It's a scam. You'll notice that people long in this community who are generally open to alts still oppose bcash. Why? Bcash is a failed vision of what Bitcoin is meant to be - a decentralized crypto that is fast and cheap. It's not a scam to the few powerful and well-funded interests who joined together to force-feed it to the market. But look around you, what does the grass roots community support? What do the brains support? Anyone with vision can see bcash is focused on short term gains at the expense of true engineering with long term sustainability. I know many people who buy bitcoin and alts. I don't know a single person who buys bcash.

"People don't think bitcoin be like it is, but it do." 
Translation: There are too many things in the mix that affect price so it's anyone's guess. In general though there is a loose macro pattern to bitcoins price (bubble, pop, consolidation, growth, repeat). The current price is not in the bubble phase right now. Beyond that, theories abound.
My guess? Different types of people jump into bitcoin for different reasons at different price points at different parts of the bubble cycle. Low prices attract strong hands, High prices attract weak hands, and after every bubble there is a shakeout period. And as the market cap of each bubble grows compared to the previous, it takes even more strong hands to hodl on, maintain a price, build a foundation, and allow the next bull run. We might be in a bear market for longer than the 2014-2016 period. Perhaps this time it is 8 years for the balance to be made.


Your question is too imprecise to give a meaningful answer. So instead I'll pose some questions.
- What's the difference between currency and money?
- What is "instability"?
- If bitcoin's instability is more stable than other currencies (Bolivar, for example) could it still be considered a currency? What about a useful currency?
- In the history of economics, how often are new currencies created? What are the different ways currencies are created? When is the last time your country went from one currency to another currency? Was it pegged to a pre-existing currency? Was it a completely free-market currency? What was that process like?
We are in uncharted territory with all of this. No one can see the whole picture. No one can tell you why the price is low, with any certainty. Also, I like the brainless hodl shit. :)

No. In a free market with competing currencies the trend is for one currency to win. It’s inherently unstable for two or more currencies to survive, all else being equal. (Unless a new currency offers some advantage over the previous. Like anonymity. But as bitcoin adds anonymity, monero and others will die out.) Higher price will attract more users as the deflationary property of the currency is what people will desire.

I've seen all the posts and never got the sense he was a savior. My interpretation was that people were excited another famous person was promoting bitcoin, and sometimes celebrations like that last for days. 
Also, I'm not much concerned with how people come to use bitcoin. Again, all spokes lead to the center. I was part of the wikileaks herd years ago. It was a tangible use case unrelated to money...or so I thought. I simply wanted to support wikileaks, I didn't care about bitcoin itself. Only years later after reading and learning did I begin to see the importance of bitcoin. And I kept bitcoin on exchanges for many years before I understood how to hold my own keys. ProofOfKeys is a great idea because it helps remind/encourage people how to hodl their own.

JP and Rubin only came into prominence in the last 2 years. 
- Rubin was on the Young Turks, hardcore left, arguably incapable at the time of recognizing the nuances of free speech that he now seems to understand. 
- JP was very socialist in his youth but most of what he says now is pro-individual rights. 
- I was pro-socialism 20 years ago.
My point is, people evolve, so let's give space for them to evolve and refrain from judgement. 
My personal view of bitcoin has always been "I want my enemies to benefit from it". Bitcoin is a system larger than any ideology. It's a gift to all of mankind and it deserves support from all angles.
So even if people's intentions are "impure" for using Bitcoin, it doesn't matter. The bigger issue is a simple one - that people use it and talk about it - because that will benefit us all.

It's infinitely divisible in theory and as necessity dictates. Meaning...
If a single satoshi ever becomes so valuable that a user needs to subdivide it (as would be the case if the entire bitcoin economy was based on a single bitcoin instead of 21 million) then the code would be updated to allow for more decimal places. 
It's infinitely divisible.

Also, I'm surprised it took JP this long to realize the benefits of bitcoin.

- If that's the onramp people need to get comfortable with bitcoin, that's fine.

Deflationary currency encourages saving. 
People will still spend when necessary. Food, products, etc. It's a balance of time preference - save this money now because it will be worth more in the future vs spend it now and get something that benefits my life immediately. 
Computers are deflationary. The technology gets better every week. Yet people still buy iPhones instead of waiting. 
Deflationary currencies are not just fine, they are amazing.

True, sending funds TO a hardware wallet might be more subject to hacking. 
Sending funds FROM a hardware wallet are hacker proof. If you've confirmed the address on your trezor and sign the transaction there, then there is no way to "change" the transaction. It is already signed. If the hacker tries to change it, it is unsigned and won't be valid to the network.

Schiff probably has certain obligations to Gold Money and promoting them as best he can, but also realizes that to maintain his credibility he needs to read the writing on the wall. 
So he's playing the long game and probably has already mapped out a plan to justify his reversal on bitcoin over the next weeks/months/years.
Also wouldn't surprise me if he needed time to learn about it and formulate a business model around crypto so that he can capitalize on himself promoting it. He may be the Gold Guy who will deliver the Gold Bugs to crypto. He's a brand name, so that carries weight. And he's not stupid.
tl;dr - he's wrapping up obligations to Gold Money, then will promote bitcoin once he has a proper business set up to capitalize on it.

Gold is not infinitely divisible because eventually you hit the atomic limit. Bitcoin is infinitely divisible because you can always add more decimal places.

It might be infinite in the sense that you can create/duplicate an infinite number of spinoffs. But you can't create more than 21 million bitcoin. 
Humans desire scarcity because it is necessary for communicating value to each other. It doesn't matter if there are an infinite number of bitcoin spinoffs. All that matters is that there's an agreed upon way to communicate value. Bitcoin has first mover advantage, network effect, development, scarcity, and a reputation of trust. 
That's what matters and that's why forking isn't inflationary.

If she says she's not buying, then she'll get questions about "why aren't you buying if you just said it's going to be important."
But if she says it's too expensive, it implies she might buy in the future but right now is not a good time. Perfect cop-out answer. This inhibits a buying spree triggered by her influential position, gives her plausible deniability later when bitcoin takes off, and allows her time to accumulate.

A few things going on here.
Forking bitcoin is like being able to take all the gold in the world, snap your fingers, and double it. But there's a catch. 
- The new "gold" isn't actually gold, it's a different type of metal with similar but not identical properties. What gives Bitcoin value is many things - reputation, network effect, first mover advantage, development. You can't actually create more gold/bitcoin. And at the moment of creation, no one trusts that new gold. It has to prove it's utility. But if it doesn't offer much different than bitcoin, there's no benefit.
- Also, when you double it, all holders of bitcoin get both coins. Imagine the US Govt doubling the supply of money (essentially a fork in a way) by taking all accounts and cash and doubling it. If you had $1000 in the bank or cash, now you have $2000. Prices in the market would double to compensate and there would be no net difference in the economy. (Except your salary wouldn't double.)

[Human nature expresses itself differently based on environmental conditions. 2:40-5:50](
I think most people underestimate the effects of monetary policy on all strata of society: social organization, behavior, and economics (both micro and macro). But those affects have a wide range of possible expression depending on the policy.
For example, [interest rates affect on time preference](
I happen to believe (based on my historical/economic understanding) that society is more fair, stable, and non-violent (less war, less mal-investment, less waste, less monetary debasement) under free-market monetary policy. 
What we have seen evolve over the last few 100 years is that human nature prevents free-market monetary policy from coming into being. So the only solution is something that exists outside of monopolistic human control. Something decentralized.

If these are physical bitcoin, then they are casascius coins. At the height of the bubble, they were worth almost $80,000. Today they are worth a strong $32,000. And that's not even accounting for their added value as a novelty physical bitcoin.

Yes, but the market will demand it. People will use bitcoin out of necessity, trust it, trade in it, and eventually their gov't will cede sovereignty or fail.


Pretty sure Libertarians understand violence (or at least a belief the threat of violence is a real possibility) that brings order.


People will use bitcoin because it's in their best interest. Just like gold was in their best interest when the industrial revolution was built.




Violence against tort'r violators would exist in libertarian utardia. 


Small gov't can be funded with tariffs, sales tax, what-have-you.


Social unity can come from many places, even such a place as survival through global economic collapse and renewed hope rooted in a decentralized, trustless, predictable currency.


World 'bout to get rekt by its own shortcomings, people don't have a choice in the matter, the equation is baked.
World 'bout to get transformed by bitcoin, people don't have a choice in that matter either, necessity will drive them.

The great government mother protects you from 'most' scams except their own. And in the process we become economically enslaved children.
This free-market money experiment with Bitcoin and other Crypto will force humanity to evolve. It will create a new path to solving fraud, and be far more fair, robust, and anti-fragile because of it.
Probably the difference between you and me is time horizons. I'm more concerned with building the economy that will take us to the stars, bring wealth and prosperity to more people, free the human spirit. It's a concern for the greater good that also happens to benefit us immediately in our lifetimes. 
But to get there, we need to grow.

There's an important difference between hyper-inflation and something being infinitely divisible. 
Hyper-Inflation is printing more dollars, which causes your own dollars to lose value in the process.
Infinitely divisible is taking your dollar bill and being able to divide it not only into cents, but micro-cents. Your dollar doesn't lose value in this process because the total dollars in the economy is not increasing.

When bitcoin replaces all fiat incumbent systems - which will no longer need to waste  resources to run their system of money printing, server farms, trucks, brick and mortar - that is the efficiency you’re looking for.

It also implies that we may be in the process of climbing to $10,000 where it will hit resistance for only 6 months before climbing to $100,000 over 16 months.
Also, it isn't just the US investing in bitcoin, so milestones denominated in USD will mean less as time goes on. 
For example, it might mean that even though a milestone is hit in one currency and has resistance, that it might not be the case for other currencies which keep climbing, so resistance is broken much faster. 
It's a runaway trolley car.

Andreas gave a good Q and A response to this saying that bitcoin mining cpus were far behind moores law and playing catch up, so the updates to the hardware were advancing faster than moores law. So by the time your CPU arrives outside of China and gets hooked up, you don't have much time before it's obsolete. So once it catches up, hashing power will stabilize and it will be more cost effective to move CPUs around the world. That happens in early 2018 if I recall correctly.

BUYING BITCOIN
1. Buy bitcoin on Coinbase
2. Store your bitcoin on Coinbase while you learn about hardware wallets.  
HARDWARE WALLETS
1. Buy a hardware wallet (trezor, ledger, etc)
2. Go through the setup of your 24 word seed and passphrase. 
3. Don’t transfer bitcoin yet. 
4. Imagine scenarios where you lose your wallet or your house burns down or whatever. How do you recover your seed so you can recover your bitcoin? Figure that system out. Maybe you store your seed at home in a hidden place and a safety deposit box. (Don’t store your passphrase and seed in the same place. Your passphrase will ensure no one can steal your bitcoin even if they find your seed, Don’t store anything online in emails or websites.)
5. Once you are comfortable, transfer a small amount of bitcoin to the hardware wallet. 
6. Go through your recovery process again. 
7. Once it’s foolproof, transfer over all your bitcoin from Coinbase.

If block1 reward is 50 BTC, and block2 is 49.9999 BTC, then there's .0001 less BTC being created compared to the current reward scheme. Carried out over tens of thousands of blocks would be less BTC. I wonder what that difference is though. 
Anyway, there'd be no excitement over the halving in that case. I was just curious if there was more to that from a game theory perspective.

EDIT: Ahh, I see what you mean. It would take longer to issue. Makes sense.
You could have the linear falloff be the same so it coincides with every 4 years. 
For example, block1 is a 50 BTC reward. Block2 is a 49.9999 BTC reward, and so on. Until blockX - where normally it would cut in half from 50 to 25 - by that point is already at 25 BTC reward. The block before it (BlockX-1) would have been 25.00001 BTC.
I was curious if people who knew game theory might have an indepth thought about why it was structure this way. For example, gold mining is probably a more gradual ramp-up/down reward mechanism, as mines are opened and closed.

I’m gonna do some bad math. 
If we instead had only 20,000,000 bitcoin but the number of coins was inflated at 2% per year (What the FED currently targets) then we would get. 
Year 0: 20,000,000
Year 1: 20,400,000
Year 2: 20,800,000
Year 3: 21,224,160
So with moderate inflation, the currency supply would inflate in 3 years to the amount roughly equal to satoshi’s holdings.

Equally, it isn't outside the realm of possibility that bitcoin was not only created by the NSA, but created for beneficial purposes. 
If a government agency has any interest in the sovereignty and health of the nation - assuming such a noble cause is still possible in leviathan - then Bitcoin might just be a technology designed to hedge the risk against the known coming collapse of a fiat built global economy.

Could the message not incorporate payment forwarding? My assumption is that a message would always cost money to send, so it would be treated just like a payment and provide monetary incentives.
Big advantage of a network like this is that it would be anonymous, censorship resistant, and decentralized. I'd pay a micro premium for that. Additional advantage is that it would be robust, because it would piggy back on a payment network people would already be using.

Based on the video it seems like the biggest way the US (and other governments) could try to control Bitcoin would simply be to declare it illegal and tell merchants in their country they can't use it. 
Further, they would then use diplomatic pressures to ensure other countries fall into line and also declare Bitcoin illegal. At this point, merchants might flee to the few remaining countries that support Bitcoin, but then how would they do business with the rest of the world? If you want to buy goods from those countries, there could simply be a blacklist or even embargoes to prevent goods from leaving the country.
Bitcoin would work for day to day transactions between citizens. It might even work for businesses who can hide their acceptance of bitcoins to a certain degree, but would always face the possibility of arrest. But for a site like Amazon, how could they use bitcoin as payment if it's declared illegal?
I'm sure I'm missing something though.

What is your opinion on the current state of bitcoin scaling, the various implementations, and bitcoins future overall from a birds eye view? Where do you take a stand (or not take a stand)?

Powers That Be are desperate to keep the price low so they can accumulate. 
They are running out of ideas to spread fud and misinformation. 
They found CSW when scraping the bottom of the barrel.

"Central Origin" can be read positively. Real Money is the center of all economic transactions and thus the foundation of a robust economy. BTC could become that.

1/21th of the way there.

I waited a few minutes and it worked again.

Why aren't you running it?

Both get to smell it but neither get to eat it.

But don't all these countries have central banks whose best interest is NOT to have people dumping their inflationary currencies in favor of something deflationary?
Also, isn't China purposely buying treasuries to devalue it's own currency to keep their products cheap and their economy pumping and competitive?

I was actually surprised by this video.
They ignore what he is saying, start playing music to end the segment, and talk about sports instead. This is the type of scenario that happens any time someone brings up something controversial that doesn't fit with the media's narrative. "Oh, we don't like that. Quick, get him off the air! Now!"
That's why this surprises me, I would have expected the opposite based on what he is saying.
