Any chance you could dig up the analysis for us?

Yeah, I'm sure [these professors at stanford]( are out to brain wash the fuck out of us! /s

don't know why people are downvoting you, I completely agree. Form is as important if not more important than content. +100 bits

I'm downvoting in hopes that will value more mature discussions than the typical "fuck the establishment, anarchy FTW" nonsense that tends to be around here. I'd love to read up on how 


Can you elaborate on these ideas or give us some sources? I genuinely think blindly antagonizing university professors won't help the image of the current bitcoin community...

I know some of of you may have seen this before based on some of the comments here but I found this when I found it on [this top page post]( of which was a subreddit I've never heard of until [this front page ask reddit post this morning]( I always find it quite interesting when I see bitcoin related content on non bitcoin subreddits/communities, like clickhole. And I'm sure other non-bitcoiners found this video just like I happened to find it this morning. And no, I've honestly never seen it before and I sincerely apologize for "reposting" it.

Funny, I just realized that I'm currently studying for my last upper div econometrics class. So to answer your question, ye...zzzzzzzz

The way I got into bitcoin was actually when I took my first Macro Econ class in college exactly a year ago. I stumbled upon an article that talked about how bitcoin was the first deflationary currency when I was trying to learn how fractional reserve banking worked, went down the rabit whole, and 2.5 BTCs later I'm here to ask these questions that's been bugging me for the past year.
One of the benefits of an inflationary currency that's controlled by the government (and please correct me if I'm wrong) is that being able to control and increase the money supply enables nations to build more infrastructure and ultimately GDP growth through increasing the money supply. The example I read about was that if someone wants to build a $2m(illion) house, they take a $2m loan out from the banks, pay the contractors who will build the house, and then pay the bank back with interest. This is only possible due to the increased money supply via fractional reserve banking since the banks never had $2m but a fraction of it that allowed the loan to happen.... alright I hope I got that part right.
So here are my questions. First, if there's a limited money supply with BTC and BTC becomes the global currency, could one argue/oppose the idea of bitcoin by claiming BTC won't be as nearly stimulating to GDP/world economy since you won't be able to create jobs and assets like the example above? 
But I've also read that BTC's money supply can be increased since the decimal point can be increased when the miners agree to increase the decimal point (thereby allowing the currency to deflate even more and increase money supply). Is there a "check this box if you agree with the new protocol" kind of thing that the miners do when a new protocol that increases the decimal point comes along?
My apologies for the lack of sources, please correct me if I'm wrong I'd love to learn more about BTC.

Thanks for the in depth answers! 
This leads me to more questions,




Doesn't the government control/try to influence **interest rates** through buying back/lending government bonds and quantitative easing by controlling money supply that's printed out of thin air? 
And if so, wouldn't the money generated through the interests rates (influenced by the money supply controlled by th government) be additional money supply to the economy?
And you also mention


If the masses currently are ok with fractional reserve banking and if they start adopting btc for btc's ease of use and security purposes, why and/or how (potentially) would they change their minds all of a sudden?


Wouldn't divisibility + deflation lead to more money supply since there'd be more bits (fractions) of bitcoins that are eventually going to be worth more via deflation? If a penny can be divided into a hundred pieces and they eventually become worth as much as pennies before the division due to deflation, didn't you just increase the money supply by 100 more pennies per pennies in existence?
