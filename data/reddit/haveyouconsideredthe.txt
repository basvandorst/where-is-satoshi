It would be great if there was some way to report to coinbase that you didn't receive the product you paid for and they refunded your money and investigated with the merchant.  Someone should invent a payment system that can do something like that!

Why are you advertising it here and every where else if its not a finished project and ready to be evaluated then?


But your site says "We create programs at the request of our customers instead of making software at our own whim and selling it to customers. "


Then I ask again what will you be accepting bitcoin for?




If you're planning to charge money you're going to be a commercial entity and will be evaluated like one.  Right now what I'm seeing is something that reminds me of what I use to start all the time when I was 14.  If you're 14 that's cool that you're trying but you shouldn't waste your time on this since best case you likely take someones money and piss them off and give yourself a bad name on google results for a long time.  Focus on your coding.  If you're not going to make a business like you say then stop advertising that you will be taking peoples money.  If you are going to do a business then you have to get registered and do a lot more to convince people that you know what you're doing.

1) But it does to be a form of money which is what they are saying  
2) It's not a valid unit of measurement in Canada because no one here knows how much a stone weighs.  Even Canadians that move to England often take years to get an estimate of what size someone is if someone describes them as 11 stone  
3)  Money that is a store of value decreases commerce.  It defeats the purpose of money.  I meant that I agree that their statement is wrong not with your belief that bitcoin is right  
4) Trust a third party?  But every other post here says anyone who does so is an idiot.  So what is it?

In decline before the internet




You'd be surprised at how many people and companies still use traditional tour operators and booking agents.  The internet allows companies to compete with them but they still exist and are very popular for the most part the internet has just given them another source of customers.


Both still exist and are making buckets of money.  CD/DVD sales though have been all but killed by the internet.




I'm on the fence on this one unless you're using decimated to just mean killed 10% of their usage then ya.


The English is strong in this one.  People still like going to the shops and still largely do.  Big box stores and things like book stores are the ones that really took the hit.


Source?  While I don't believe in the supernatural and I'm an atheist I missed where we proved it.

Yes, I've heard that for 6 months now how multisig will save the day.  Multisig is a usability nightmare though so it will never be used(are you using it right now?).  The fact that you need one or more third parties to authorize any use of your money sounds a lot like just using a bank.  Only in the banks case they will insure me against loses unlike my multisig cosigner.
In the future no one will insure individuals bitcoin.  It's just too easy to defraud that system.  You think most businesses will get rid of the 2-3% margin just because some of their customers start using bitcoin?  Don't be daft.

Bitcoin won't be adopted as widely as you think because it doesn't do things better than the existing system which is low effort for almost everyone.  There won't be a time where everyone will hold a balance of bitcoin because it is better for certain transactions so there won't be a time where people won't have to buy bitcoin specifically to manage these microtransactions.

@_date: 2014-05-11 02:42:15
They don't have to stop it completely to kill its value.  
Method 1: Ban bitcoin transactions.  Suddenly getting bitcoin is akin to a drug deal and since legal payment systems exist and work well no one will do it nor do they really need to since there is nothing legal they can spend it on.  Demand and price would fall rapidly and all but the most hardcore fans would drift away leaving it all but dead.
Method 2: Make it illegal to run a node or mine bitcoin.  Both are easily tracked down and easily shut down.  Which leads to all the major ASIC mining operations closing down since they are too difficult to hide.  Network is now extremely vulnerable to 51% attacks which works since the government has a lot of confiscated ASIC miners.
@_date: 2014-05-11 22:15:14
That's not the question though.  You're changing it because it's obvious the bitcoin method is much worse.
Everyone constantly claims that bitcoin is much better at sending money around the world.  It's instant and it's free.  But they always skip over the fact that you have to acquire it first and sell it on the other side and that is why it always loses to traditional means.
So ya, bitcoin is great if you already have it and the other side wants bitcoin.  But if you have cash and the other side wants cash then it's pretty shit.

Bitcoin is small now because it doesn't offer any benefits to the payment process for consumers doing day to day activities.

Dogecar: Good for general crypto

I'm sure you've made lots and lots of money.  The thing is most people here seem to think a few tens or hundreds of thousands is life changing that's why I'm skeptical about your claims.
*YOU* have an asset that has increased by thousands of percent.  Most people don't.  There was a report published 2 days ago that said 22% of coins were moved 3-6 months ago.  So its quite likely 22% of owned coins right now are under water.
Also you would literally have to never read to not regularly see stories of people who bought 10-20 bitcoins near the peak or during the run up only to talk about losing half trying altcoins.
Most people investing in bitcoin think they are smarter than they are because they got lucky once and end up fucking it up.

Not every currency or item in the world is vulnerable to theft from the other side of the world.  I don't think you know what the word fraud means if you think bitcoin is immune to being used in fraud.
Those systems don't actually depend on high security minded users.  Bitcoin demands it.  That is a failing in bitcoin which will continue it's fall into uselessness.
Overstock and Tiger Direct both had almost all of their bitcoin sales in the first 2 days.  Since then they've both had next to nothing in bitcoin traffic.
It doesn't reduce internal costs that much unless you're doing extremely high values of sales through the system since you have to pay to maintain another payment interface.  You will almost certainly have to offer a discount to customers to get them to actually go through the hassle of getting bitcoin so in the end you're probably saving nothing at all.  
@_date: 2014-04-28 18:35:32
Why does everyone here treat VC financing like an approval stamp?  VCs invest in extremely high risk high reward situations they expect almost all of their investments to fail which is why they have no problem tossing money at cryptocurrency companies.  Just like they tossed money at the previous generation of emoney companies(which all failed).  They aren't saying bitcoin is a sure thing they are saying it's got a very high risk of flopping but if it doesn't they expect a very high return.

That's why I'm skeptical since they are difficult to find and very new.  I mean online hotel booking is super competitive and they have a blank twitter and facebook linked on their site.

Nope, I'm reading all the stories from merchants that are accepting it.  It is almost universal no one uses it.  Even the darling of the community overstock say an almost complete drop off in usage within just 2 months(Actually with 50% of their first 2 months earnings in the first 2 days I guess you could say a near complete drop off after just 2 days).  I mean everyone here talks about how they use overstock and overstock advertises their bitcoin stuff constantly but after doing ~$500K in the first 2 days it took them another 2 months to hit $1m in revenue.

It makes 0 sense to use bitcoin as a regular payment method unless you happen to already have a stash of it.  You add complexity to the process by adding the purchasing of bitcoin, very few merchants actually offer discounts so you are actually paying more to use them, you lose all consumer protection so its riskier to use them in the event of fraud or a dispute with the seller.  There really is no good use case for using them if you're making legal purchases and that's why almost no one does use them for legal purchases.

50,000 stores in the whole world?  That sounds like a high figure until you realize there is over 80,000 restaurants in Canada and a couple hundred thousand retail establishments(and Canada is a fairly small country population wise).  So even if every one of those 50,000 places was in Canada we'd be looking at only 25% acceptance in Canada.  And that's assuming all 50K stores still accept it.  As many people here have found out a lot of places that did accept it no longer do.


I see this is basically dodging the questions.  The BoC says no one actually prices stuff in Bitcoin and advertises it the price in bitcoin at a stable level(websites often do auto conversion from fiat and show that price but they still advertise it in terms of the fiat price).  And you say "But it's divisible."  Which has nothing to do with it.
3rd one I agree with.  I don't think money should be a store of value it should encourage trade.

If you store it correctly.  Which requires very good computer security knowledge, a computer that never goes online and trust of 3rd parties.  No body is going to touch the cash I bury in my backyard either but its not very useful there.


You still need personal information if you need anything delivered and CC numbers are designed to be easily replaceable so it doesn't matter if they get stolen.


There are still transaction fees and you also have fees for getting bitcoin and fees for selling it.  Transaction fees are also very heavily subsidized at the moment due to block rewards to the tune of $20-30 per transaction.


The fact that its not better at anything it tries to do.

You accept BTC for what exactly?
Where is the company registered?  You list the sole employee as CEO if I look through your post history will I find Now some suggestions from someone that actually works as a consultant.
1. Get rid of No News :(  
2. Contact change your email back to normal format.  Most all email harvesting bots will be able to read x at y dot com just as easily as x and you explanation that you don't know that is worrying coming from a tech consultancy.  
3. Want to Join? Makes it sound like a club not a company.  If you can pay people switch it to employment opportunities.  If you can't get rid of that line.  The only people that would 'join' it would be kids.  
4. Your business model needs to be reworded completely.  As it is it sounds like you're a complete amateur and probably a very bad programmer.  No one is going to pay you.  If that is true then give up creating a consultancy until you are more establish.  You talk about being a service based company then immediately mention products you make.  
5.  You need to post the CV for the CEO since there is nothing to indicate they can program at all to be found on google.

Yes, they had $1m in sales in 2 months.  $500K of that in the first 2 days.  It's been more than 2 months since that million and they are really silent about the numbers now.  Assuming they save 2% on all transactions with bitcoin they've probably saved about $20K.  Though they paid 50+ developers to work on it for a month so they probably spent 300-500K on it.  Not to mention they've been holding 10% apparently while it's slid 40% in value from when they made that first 500K so thats another 25K in losses due to dropping price.

Once you account for the cost of training and inconvenience and the number of people that would actually buy bitcoin to shop at their local stores they would almost certainly lose money in the deal.  It takes a lot of sales at 2% for most stores to recoup a few hours training for all their staff.  The number of people using bitcoin in stores is tiny to non-existent.  Having more stores won't change that(buying bitcoins to spend locally is pretty stupid for most people).

Pretty sure you're a troll but in case not one last reply.


No, in other words you are too dumb to understand what I'm saying or why your recommended business practices are idiotic so I'm wasting my time.


I never said you needed access to the bank accounts I said you needed access to the transactional flow.  The fact that you don't know the difference tells me you are almost certainly lying about all the experience you claim here.


That has nothing to do with anything I've said.  That sounds more like a slush fund.


No, I'd be amazed if any businesses doing more than $5 sales a month operate the way you recommend.  Maybe some little home businesses but not any real ones.


So how does your local workflow access the public ledger?  Or are you seriously recommending a member of staff sit there and go through every transaction match them up to ensure they've been paid?


And how does that work into any sort of automated systems?  Did you know with todays technology you can actually build all this into your business?  That is where the complexity is.
I see the problem now.  Your experience is with tiny home businesses who probably have an order form where you call them at the end to confirm everything.  Sure the way you describe would probably work for them and be easy to integrate.  I'm talking about real businesses that do more than a half dozen orders a month.


If you integrated it the way you've described here I'm guessing it was your mom or dads home business website correct?

No actually the opposite.  If a countries banking collapsed but they used the euro that currency would still be valuable elsewhere so they could trade it for bitcoin.
If they used a national currency that is collapsing during a banking crisis where locals are presumably having their funds confiscated you would have to be an idiot to buy it in exchange for bitcoin.  Remember for them to buy into bitcoin someone has to be willing to buy into their collapsing currency.

If there were buyers it wouldn't be dropping or flat lining.   As it is buyers just barely match the number of sellers hence flat lining but for the past few months there have been more sellers than buyers.

How many of those merchants have sold 1 thing in the past month with bitcoin?  My guess would be maybe 5K.  Though I think that may be a bit high.  How many will still accept bitcoin in 2 months?  Posts here to the effect of "Such and such no longer taking bitcoin" are almost a daily occurrence.  Why are these merchants leaving what should be a great payment source for them?  Because no one is buying anything with bitcoin.
Bitcoin can of course be used for a lot.  It's just not better than the existing methods for any of them when you're looking at it from the consumer side.

Those businesses are welcome to decide themselves and I'm free to say that if you follow a petition by a bunch of people with no interest in your business and spend money implementing a new payment system you're probably pretty bad at business and will likely only have the cost of the new payment system on your books in the end.

It is the hidden profit and because it's not stable they can move it up and down as they want without you realizing it unless you monitor the market and their rates constantly.  It is the definition of a hidden fee because it's not defined anywhere.
Unless you're using traditional banking systems or have a credit card already it will definitely be more expensive to go fiat-&gt;btc-&gt;coinbase-&gt;fiat than a 1.9-2.9% credit card fee.  An ATM or local bitcoins would be double to triple that alone on just the first step.

No, the difference is a major selling point for bitcoin is that it is going for buying X.  So when it isn't that is a big downside.

Does your FTC numbers break out what kind of identity theft?  Because they count using a stolen credit card as identity theft which probably accounts for pretty much 100% of those 9 million.  In those cases the worst that happens is the person has to call their bank and let them know the fraudulent transactions and sign a document stating that the transactions are fraudulent and they get a new card.  It's not really a big deal and the loss is a bit of time.
Compare that to having your bitcoins stolen where you are out 100%.

You keep saying short term growth.  I'm talking about 1.5 years and actually if you look longer term transaction rate growth was still really slow.  There was another patch of ~6 months before that with just slightly lower growth.  So now you're looking at 2 years of minimal growth.  You say short term all you want but that's getting close to all the time that bitcoin has had any real use.
It's only better for moving money around the world if you already have bitcoin and you want to spend bitcoin on the other side.  As soon as you need local currency it is much much worse than currency systems.

Everyone was talking about how it was the way of the future and how exciting it was but it just wasn't generally available but the tech while lame by todays standards was amazing then.

People who currently have bitcoin use it to buy on Amazon as a method of cashing themselves out.  Amazon sells it on the market creating downwards pressure.  The price drops.  Coinbase/bitpay make their money off setting a price and selling/buying bitcoin at it with a spread to cover market movements.  In a down market their estimates are more likely to be over the value for purchases and under the value for sales so they will lose money.
That said almost no one is spending bitcoin at stores so it's possible Amazon will do close to 0 traffic as well.

Bitcoin is still here because there are a lot of people that are heavily invested in it being successful since they've invested so much into it and they work constantly on propping it up with lies and false information.

No that is user adoption.  Merchant adoption would be the number of merchants accepting it which is definitely going up.
How do you know the number of bitcoiners has been going up?  The number of transactions, and days destroyed have been completely flat.  Add to that the fact that you will have a very tough time finding a single merchant that is doing good business in bitcoin.
Overstock did 500K in 2 days.  It took them another 2 months to do another 500K.  They haven't said since then but that it is around 0.01% of their sales.  Bitcoin Boulevard(NL) did 1.4btc in transactions in a month across all stores and restaurants.  Bitcoin Boulevard(US) is making excuses for why no one is using btc.
The price currently is 99% speculation which will fail since no one is entering the market.  Almost everyone who will use or buy into bitcoin has.  Expect stagnation and a continued gradual drop with the exception of the odd single whale pumping the prices.

They paid ~50 developers to implement it not counting costs of maintaining it.  Lets be kind and say 1 extra developers time required to maintain the new payment system.  That's $100K a year there.
They have sold $1 million in merchandise but they haven't made $1 million in profit.  Their margin is low enough that they probably made less than $100K on that $1 million.  Though there is a chance they made a bit more so it's possible they've made hundreds of dollars but they certainly aren't near a million.
Not to mention they apparently withhold 10% according to the CEO and the price has dropped almost 40% on those coins they are holding so thats another 40K down the drain.

Edit: just realized you actually don't understand what cumulative means.  The chart shows the total number of transactions of all time.  The fact that it is growing in a straight line means that the transaction volume is the exact same.  If it starts to flatten out that shows a dropping in transaction volume.  It isn't showing 4x growth it is showing 4x the number of transactions from the start point but 0 growth.  You could send yourself 1 transaction a day and have it be the only transaction of every day and see a line that looks the exact same.

You can shut off public access while still allowing government access.

Seriously?  I said it like multiple times above.  You accused me of not reading above as well.
So it doesn't bother you because 1.5+ years ago it was growing and for half that time it hasn't been growing at all?
It is a reflection in the decline in bitcoin since even if you hold we can assume every new bitcoin user won't so the fact that there is no growth shows there is a pretty strong likelyhood that there is no growth.
The nature of bitcoin changes every other day on here depending on what tells the better story.  The nature of bitcoin is that it is a cool tech but that when it comes to finances almost no one wants or needs and doesn't work better than existing solutions for almost any problem.
It only works as a store of value as long as there is demand and every indicator is showing that demand is slowing and dropping.  I don't expect it to drop too much anytime soon but I expect it to continue its slow decline as more and more people leave and fewer enter the space.

Lets go with the modem relay nodes.  First up they are easy to shut down since they would have a connection on the local ISP(find and shut down all bitcoin nodes as they pop up.  Problem solved) so they are easily found and easy to cut off from the network inside the country.  That would actually stop the other methods as well but assuming somehow you got around that to try them...
All the other methods wouldn't work since they could take literally days to confirm transactions.  A cash replacement that takes days to confirm you have the money isn't going to work.  Ignoring the fact that Venezuela isn't a tiny country so that would only help with bitcoin usage along the borders.

Yes, They did 500K in their first 2 days then it took then 2 months to do another 500K.  It's been more than 2 months since that period and they are being very quiet about actual numbers these days(I wonder why?).
So assuming they saved 2% on those sales that means in 2 months they saved $20,000.  To get the system integrated they paid 40 programmers for a week.  Assuming they are on the low end of pay that's about $100K in developer time.  That's not counting the on-going expense of maintaining a second payment systems.

1) If they make it illegal it will shrink the market and make it almost impossible to convert to fiat/buy it for most people.  Trying to find a dealer to meet with to sell you bitcoin through like localbitcoin, etc today wouldn't work since the police could just have a weekend setting up stings and arresting everyone that came to them.
2) Demand isn't increasing because for almost every transaction for almost every person there is no benefit to the consumer to using bitcoin.
3) It often just adds a step to most transactions with no real benefit.  There is 1 thing it's better than traditional payment methods(international transfers) at and that depends highly on the quality of the exchanges on the receiving end which in a lot of the world are crap or non-existent.
Most all of the benefits are on the merchant side which is why consumer adoption is shit.
