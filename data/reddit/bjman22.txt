It's a good discussion. But the Etherium guy forgot to mention that the vast majority of the money in the DAO was basically held by about 10-20 addresses. Most of these I am sure were owned by the people who wrote and implemented the fork. Blatant self-serving action.

Here's the easy answer to your question. Suppose you spend that money and buy the amount of bitcoin you want. Now imagine this, you wake up the next morning and the price of bitcoin is at $500--the drop happened in just one night !! What do you do now? How would you feel?
If the answer is that you would feel like throwing up and suddenly start shaking, then definitely DO NOT purchase bitcoin with that money.

Thanks for that link. Very helpful.
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:56:28
No..it's not reversible. Sorry, I wasn't clear. There are 2 addresses involved in a transaction--the address you pay FROM and the address you pay TO. The address you pay TO, you don't derive the public key of--the network pays to the address, which is a hash of the public key. So the public key is not derived or known at this point--ie. an address can receive payments without ever revealing it's actual public key to the network. 
The address you pay FROM has the public key used in the transaction and that's where the space savings come from in the transaction data by using the compressed address/public key format. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:01:45
Not quite---the wallet software asks you for the public 'address' but the software converts that 'address' to the public key in the background--as a user you don't see this. But, the information that actually is transmitted in a transaction is the public key--not the public address. Remember that the wallet signs the transaction using the private key of the public key included in the transaction--the address is irrelevant and is used only to derive the public key. 
Bottom line--using the compressed public address leads to using the compressed public key which saves about half the space in the transaction and therefore saves space in the block chain.

Yes..Deflation (like in Bitcoin) is TERRIBLE...that's why there is a new BIP that will adjust the inflation rate of bitcoin based on 'economic growth'...so as the economy keeps growing, the supply of bitcoin will keep growing too !!!   /s

Tether is a SCAM--without question. It's terrible for bitcoin and all cryptocurrencies and the faster it self-destructs the better it will be.

Thanks. Do you have a promo code for r/bitcoin readers? :)
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:48:29
Exactly. The money in the bank is NOT YOUR MONEY. The bank took your money and loaned it out. You only have a CLAIM on that money. If everyone with claims on their money tries to take it out, the bank won't have that money--see Greece, Cyprus, etc.  
Bitcoin is YOUR MONEY, which YOU CONTROL. If you don't care about this basic principle, then there is no need to really own ANY bitcoin--except for gambling and speculation. If that's the case, then fees and whatnot are irrelevant since your bitcoins need to be at an exchange (for trading purposes).
@_date: 2018-01-24 17:50:37
Originally bitcoin was as you described--pay to public key (P2PK). The hashing of the public key is a great advance and a big improvement. Bitcoin became pay to public key hash (P2PKH). 
One benefit of using a hash of the public key (the address) is that there is some minor error checking involved in the generation of the address so that it's harder to pay to a wrong address--if you mistype an address the system will know it's an 'invalid' address. Additionally, if you create an address and you just send bitcoins to it, even multiple transactions, the network will NEVER know the public key to that address. The public key is only revealed when you make a transaction that SPENDS from that address since that's when you have to sign a transaction with the private key. 
Therefore, in the future, if quantum computers are developed that can break ECDSA (the cryptography behind bitcoin)--eg. you can calculate the private key from the public key, then the funds in an address that has never had funds spent from it are safe. No one even knows the public key to try to use quantum computers on that address. This is another good reason not to reuse addresses--ie. don't keep spending and receiving funds from one single address.
Edit: changed hashing to ECDSA

Really? You SURE it won't be $4,000 or $3,000 or $8,000. If you knew FOR SURE you could make a lot of money!! Perhaps the bottom is already here? Who knows. Not you that's FOR SURE.

I agree with you except for one thing--the money grubbing aspect has ALWAYS been there. Go back and read bitcointalk in 2011 or 2012--a lot of threads there were about scams and about how bitcoin was going to make people rich. The difference is that now there is a lot more media attention, but the get-rich-quick and scammy aspect of bitcoin has been there for a LONG time. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:08:38
The key thing will be the major exchanges. Assuming that places like Coinbase/GDAX/Bitstamp/Gemini/Bitpay and the all the exchanges across the world have opened lightning hubs then it should be a breeze for the transactions to route because most merchants will want to connect to at least one of those exchange hubs to 'sell' their bitcoins. 
So, as an individual if you have just one channel open with one exchange you will basically be connected to the entire world as that hub will then connect to merchants and other exchanges everywhere.
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:35:24
Needless to say I don't see a drop of bitcoin to $1,000 happening this year--even in 2013, it took 2 years to reach the bottom. However, I do agree with the guy that anyone that is borrowing money on credit cards to buy bitcoins is a moron.

Why did Bitconnect need to say they were using a 'trading bot'? Everyone knew it was bullshit. Probably because initially they really intended to use a trading bot and then when the bot thing didn't work out, it became much easier to just run a classic Ponzi scheme. I believe that Tether initially (prior to 2017) really did have bank accounts that had 1:1 USD backing every single Tether. But then they lost their bank accounts--same as Bitfinex. So now what? Shut down? Why? Why not just continue the scam without actually having any real USD. After all, how many people actually ask to withdraw Tether to USD?
I think they are doing this to keep Bitfinex solvent. The truth is that Bitfinex should have completely shutdown after that hack. They need to keep it running to try to 'earn' back the money that was stolen. This is just a theory. But the 'why' reason doesn't really matter.
What really matters is that there is no way in the world that 'whales' are depositing hundreds of millions of USD into secret Tether bank accounts. No way in this entire universe that is actually happening.

A good wallet should deal with it. Maybe ask in r/BTC for specific help. I don’t keep up with anything related to BCH. However, you do understand that the address should have had bitcoins in it at the time of the fork. It’s not just about having an address that was funded a long time ago. If you moved those bitcoins prior to the fork then that address will have no BCH in it.

At the time it was $18k it was actually a good time to buy. That's the point you don't know when it's a 'good time'. It's always a good time. Trust me. 
There were a TON of people saying it was overvalued at $1,800 after it first reached that level in early 2017. In fact, Vinny Lingham boasted how he and all the 'smart money' left bitcoin at $1,250 prior to when it crashed to $800 or so. He said it was going back to $300. I'm sure many are still waiting for it to go back to that level. 
Many people that had bought bitcoin at prices below $600 in 2015 stopped buying after it went over this price. They kept waiting for it to drop back down. They are still waiting. 
It's easy after it crashed to say that it was 'too high' at $18k...but if you were watching it since below $1,000 then it was 'too high' at $1,800 and at $2,000 and at $5,000 and at $10,000 and at $18,000. It was also still 'too high' at $3500 in Dec. 2018. See?
Again, the best thing is just to buy at regular intervals regardless of price.

Be careful. The biggest risk of using those 'anonymous' exchanges is that after you deposit the bitcoins they may not let you withdraw them. It's a very well known scam. Once you make the deposit they 'freeze' your account because they need to do KYC--and no amount of documentation you provide will be enough for them.
The tricky thing is that this doesn't happen to every customer--they do it selectively. Also, be aware that people have tried depositing and withdrawing a 'small' amount and everything goes fine. It's only when they do it with larger amounts that the KYC gets 'triggered'. Be very, very careful. 
Best thing to deanonymize your coins is just to use Wasabi wallet and send them to a new addresss you control.
@_date: 2018-01-06 13:52:58
Even in this situation the Ledger device is genuine and not compromised. If the buyer had reset the Ledger and generated his own seed then he would have been fine. This scam can only work on newbies who don’t understand that the seed words are actually a private key and therefore you should never use a private key that someone else has handed you since your private key should be known only to you. 
We have a LONG way to go before the crypto currency field is ready for mainstream adoption.

Technically BTC doesn't really go up or down. It stays the same. The value of the dollar measured against bitcoin will decrease. Of course to someone holding dollars, they will tell you their value doesn't change either. 100 dollars today is still 100 dollars 10 years from now. 
But the amount of bitcoins that those 100 dollars will buy today vs. 10 years from now will be massively different.

Whether the ‘secure element’ of Ledger and Cokdcard are compromised at this point is debatable.

I don't agree because I don't think it's that complicated. It's actually all very simple--they are fooled by the idea of 'low fees' and that bitcoin is only a payment system that MUST have low fees. 
Even going back to 2012 I always wondered why would anyone want to 'accumulate' bitcoins. If it's just a payment method, then why not just buy them when you need them to make a payment. There is ZERO value in holding them because if you are interested in making a payment denominated in USD, it doesn't matter to you what the price of bitcoin is. For example, if you want to pay $1,000 and each bitcoin is $100, then you buy 10. If bitcoin is $1,000 then you just buy one. You buy bitcoin only when you need to send them. 
It wasn't until people began talking about the intrinsic value of bitcoin as a new type of 'money' instead of just a means for payment that it began to make sense. Then I could understand that bitcoin's true value lies in it's scarcity and security. It's a mind shift. If I had reached this conclusion back in 2012 then I wouldn't still need to work. :)

Yes....sure. There is a TON of people who listened to Roger Ver and sold in 2017 when it broke the new ATH of $1250. He said buy back at $300. I am sure they are still waiting to buy back. 
The point is you don't know when it is at ATH until it drops. So, let's say BTC breaks past $20k. Do you sell then? What if it goes to $30k and then drops back down to $15k? Should you  have sold at the ATH of 20k or waited to sell at $22k or 24k or 28k? How do you know at that time. It's always easy in retrospect.
When do you buy the low? Was the low $6k? Was it 5k? Was it $3.5k? At the time it was $3.5k EVERYONE thought it was going below $1k. How did that work out for them?

Yes...the fundamental genius that Satoshi came up with was not POW--that concept already existed. It was to attach POW not to the creation of new bitcoins but to whomever gets to 'record' transaction in the blockchain. It is the record of transactions in the blockchain that is backed by POW and not the creation of new bitcoins. The new bitcoins are basically given away for 'free' to whomever wins the right to write a block of transactions into the ledger. This was the real genius. 
Many others had tried to find a way to attach POW to the 'creation' of digital coins. Sasaki recognized it is not the creation of the coins that matters but the act of keeping the ledger of transactions honest--that's where the POW is needed.

Basically it’s the fact that they’re  not bitcoin. But to be more specific almost all ‘shitcoins’ are centralized projects controlled by a company, foundation, or small group of people. What they’re trying to do can be done much more efficiently using an AWS Amazon server. There’s no reason why they need a ‘blockchain’. A blockchain is incredibly inefficient. The only reason they use a blockchain is so they can issue a token that they sell to morons to fund their project. The people in control get paid and the morons holding the useless token are left holding bags of shit. Hence the name—shitcoins.

Amazon. or eBay. They're more expensive there though. Also, don't worry about tampering. A Ledger is basically tamper-proof. If it's tampered with it won't accept any firmware updates.

The Bearwhale guy sold 30,000 BTC for $300 so $9,000,000 total at Bitstamp and he said it was very straight forward. No problem whatsoever. So, 1.8M now should not be a big deal for Bitstamp to handle.

Like in this case. You need to make a transaction that’s important and time sensitive and your original device is locked away in a vault that you don’t have immediate access to.  There was a post earlier about someone who wanted to sell in Dec 2017 (at the top) but their Ledger Nano S was locked away in a bank vault in another country. That person entered their seed into Electrum and lost everything due to a keylogger. If he had another Ledger he could have entered the seed into the Ledger and he would have been safe—even with a keylogger.

I think everything it says there about Tethers and Bitfinex is absolutely true. I also think there is NO WAY that Tethers are backed by actual USD. 
However, having said that, it will have only a minimal effect on the price of bitcoin.

Wow...that was quick. How the hell does someone's passport get officially annulled and then the official annulment documents sent over to Taiwan in a matter of 2 days? There is no way. It took over a week to get that Texas rich teen that ran people over while drunk extradited from Mexico--and Mexico has an extradition treaty with the USA !!
The USA Govt. REALLY wants Cody BADLY !!
So this means that as of now if you are a US citizen and the US government wants you and you are outside the USA then all they have to do is just 'annul' your passport. 
Good to know this.

No they don't. If he has enough money, then he can hire lawyers and advisers who previously worked at the IRS and they can help him to LEGALLY cheat. However, that's a whole other different playing field. Welcome to corruption in America.

Just remember, NEVER enter your seed words that you generated on a hardware device anywhere except on another hardware wallet. 
Easiest way to do this is to always have an extra hardware wallet available. So buy 2 to begin with.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:41:14
Does that mean that if he had recovered them for you, then you would have sold them? What was the price at that time? $500, $1000. 
See you can't assume you would still have those bitcoins today. I know this doesn't help the fact that you don't have access to those bitcoins, but it does make the 'potential loss' a lot less. 
Look at the guy who sold recently showed a transaction where he had sold 4,000 bitcoins at $8 some years back--but he had bought them at less than $1. So he made out great. It makes zero sense for him to play the 'what would have been game' at this point. It's all relative.
@_date: 2018-09-24 18:35:18
Like in the case that this is referencing. Suppose you need to make a transaction that’s important and time sensitive and your original device is locked away in a vault that you don’t have immediate access to.  There was a post earlier about someone who wanted to sell in Dec 2017 (at the top) but their Ledger Nano S was locked away in a bank vault in another country. That person entered their seed into Electrum and lost everything due to a keylogger. If he had another Ledger he could have entered the seed into the spare Ledger and he would have been safe—even with a keylogger. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:43:01
I think you really should mention that all this is the direct result of the people electing a SOCIALIST government that wanted to 'HELP' the people. See how great socialism is. This is the end result after the government ends up taking all the 'rich people's money'. 
All the competent people leave the country and only morons are left in the government. It's truly disgusting what is happening there. Every single member of the Venezuelan government will need to answer for what they have done. 
Unfortunately, looking at Cuba, it's clear that the government won't change. Venezuela is a lost country--just like Cuba. I'm sorry for your loss. Socialism is a plague that needs to be wiped out.

@_date: 2018-09-24 19:50:05
No...the extra Ledger is left unused and not setup until you need it. If you need access to your wallet on the Ledger you have somewhere else, then you would take out the new one and use the option of 'Recover Wallet' instead of 'New Wallet' during the setup process. Then you enter the seed words of your old Ledger and it's like you have just 'cloned' the old Ledger. You get the exact same wallet you had before--same addresses and same balance.

There is no way that any modern-day serious exchange would leave 6,000 bitcoins in a 'hot' wallet. Bullshit. Not after all the hacks that have recently occurred. There is no reason at all to have a hot wallet be that large. 
This means the people running this exchange are either beyond moronic or this was some kind of inside job disguised as a 'hack'. 
@_date: 2018-09-25 14:38:36
Because of the time-element involved. The original thread on this was that someone required IMMEDIATE access to their Ledger but it was stored away at some bank vault. Buying another takes time. If they had a brand-new one already available they could have just entered their seed words on the new Ledger instead of using Electrum which resulted in the loss of all their bitcoins because of a keylogger.
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:04:39
Sorry I wasn't clear. I am not blaming you or anyone there--even the people who voted for the socialists were deceived by them. Of course, by now everyone has realized this, but the government will not hold true elections and will NEVER give up power. 
All I was saying is that Venezuela is NOT a special case. What is happening there is exactly what happened in Cuba and it will be the same end result in ANY COUNTRY where socialists take over. Once they are finished stealing all the money there is to steal, then you are left with nothing. The same thing was going to happen in Brazil.
It's truly sad to see what's going on there. Watching such a great country be completely destroyed is surreal. 
@_date: 2018-08-27 05:13:09
It's not even that. I remember in late 2016 when Jihan was posting cryptic tweets about being shown that he needed to be more 'involved' in the ecosystem. Basically, he was being told to play politics--and I knew then that this was not going to end well for him.
When you come from a very technical background and you have become very good (and very rich) doing something technical, the worst thing you can do is get actively involved in politics. There was no reason then for any miner to become more 'involved' in politics. Had he just kept mining, he would be infinitely better off today.

No it is not. Like I said before, you just don't understand the technical details. There isn't a single bitcoin that enters the lightning network that is not already committed to an on-chain transaction. As long as the bitcoin blockchain itself remains decentralized, there is no risk of Lightning 'centralizing' bitcoin.

Craig Wright is a true cancer to this field. This was obvious to everyone who had any kind of common sense after watching his London 'press conference' in April 2016. How that man is still around is beyond me.

2012 isn't early. 2009-2010 was early. 2012 was the first big bubble where Bitcoin went from $1 to over $30--then back down again to about $4. There were many articles written about it at that time. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 01:54:06
It makes zero sense to own something that aims to be solely a payment mechanism. Why would you own that? If you had to use that as a payment method (eg. when Bitmain accepted only BCH), you can just buy the amount you need to make the payment at the time that you need it. You don't need to 'hold' it for any period of time.
The only value in blockchain-based tokens is their decentralization and censorship-resistance. If you give up on decentralization in order to have 'better' payments, you have lost the value of a blockchain. At that point, you might as well have a centralized payment system--it's much better than any blockchain-based solution since it would would scale faster. 
All I see happening with BCH is massive centralization--both in development, in ownership, and in mining. At some point it will make no sense to have a blockchain at all. Bitmain and Coingeek will find it easier to just merge their operations (mining and development) into one 'company'. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 02:54:36
Ultimately, it doesn't matter. It's a second layer--the blockchain first layer is all that matters. Who cares if your ultimate destination is routed in 3 hops or 15 hops--as long as it gets there. 
As it stands now (in beta) I don't believe Lightning is centralized and is it develops further it will become even more decentralized. Once Lightning is fully operational, no current blockchain will be able to compete with bitcoin for making payments.
@_date: 2018-05-25 15:30:33
I think the more precise answer is that the debt is basically borrowing from the future. If that money is used productively and paid back with interest then great. If the loan is NOT paid back then the bank should cover the loss from its profits. 
HOWEVER, the big problem is that in many cases those loans are being made with no risk of loss to the bank--ie. the bank will NEVER lose money on the loans because many of them are backed by the Federal govt. and the govt is ruled by politics. When those loans go bad, the bank still makes money--only the govt. (all of us) lose money. This is the key problem with the current system.

Next time just buy multiple Ledgers and/or Trezors. You don’t have to set them all up. Just keep them ready in case of an emergency you can quickly recover your wallet without putting your keys at risk.

@_date: 2018-05-26 22:11:36
I'm sorry I can't help you. But for next time, before using a wallet make sure that after you write down the seed words, you also write down the first 'receive' address. 
Then you should wipe your wallet and use your seed words to 'recover' the wallet. Then check that the first receive address it gives you matches the one you wrote down previously. 
Only then is it safe to use that wallet. You should do this for ALL wallets--including hardware wallets.

As has been said before, he is right--it is rat poison to the rats on Wall St. 
PS. Warren Buffett is one of the biggest hypocrites in the world. Prior to 2008 he kept talking about how well funded Berkshire Hathaway was to deal with ANY financial crisis that may hit. The when the 2008 the crash threatened many of his companies (Wells Fargo among them), he was one of the biggest whiners pushing for a government bail out. What happenned to his belief in the 'free market'? 
Right, the free market is good only when you are in control of the market. If the free market is about to cause your own company to fail, then you no longer believe in the free market. 
I hope he lives long enough to see bitcoin succeed and be forced to admit how wrong he was--but I doubt it.

Honestly, that's because you don't understand the underlying technology behind it. There is a lot of misinformation about it by self-interested people. 
Briefly, I will say that for lightning to work, it's essential to understand the the channel-opening transactions are on-chain multisig transactions that are signed by both parties ahead of time. That's why you must be online to receive bitcoins--you have to sign the transaction so that the other person can close the channel and take his bitcoins back if there are any problems. The lightning network uses real-world on-chain bitcoins for final settlement. There is no 'centralization' involved. 
@_date: 2018-05-21 21:46:40
Nobody cares--they don't even know what it is. If they ask you, you can say it is a USB drive. 
Regardless, if you are concerned as to whether you need to 'declare' that you are bringing in more than $10,000--you are NOT bringing any currency. That device (or a paper wallet) has nothing but a long number stored on it. There are NO BITCOINS or any other crypto on that device--those are located on the blockchain. 
Besides, cryptocurrency is NOT currency--at least not as defined by any major goverment. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 00:26:42

Everything is about context. You are comparing bitcoin to USD. A significant change in the value of one means there has also been a change in the value of another. So, either USD got massively devalued or bitcoin got massively OVERVALUED. Either way you assume the price of everything else will stay the same USD-wise which is a WRONG assumption. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 17:26:56
The case would be winnable but you need the right plaintiff. It should have been someone who can prove (with receipts) that they went to bitcoin.com to buy 'bitcoin' and they were given BCH instead. Then this person (believing they had bitcoins) transferred the 'bitcoins' to a BTC address on an exchange and now they are lost. 
I think that person (or a group or persons) would have had an excellent case in terms of being defrauded.

I am pretty sure you will miss it again. I have read comments like yours for many, many years. See what happens is that now that bitcoin is at $8,000 of course you want to buy it at $6,000. However, if bitcoin starts to drop to $6,000 you will hear a ton of stories about how it's going below $5,000.
So, as you sit there and watch it heading to $6,000 you will say to yourself that it would be better to wait for it to be $5,000 and thus you won't buy at $6,000.

Craig Wright is total scammer and liar and I still don't understand how he could have fooled Gavin. Still, you can't simply wave off all of Gavin's contributions to bitcoin just because he made this one mistake. 
@_date: 2018-05-26 22:17:57
Did you recover the wallet previously with those seed words? It's not just writing them down, it's actually wiping the wallet and then recovering it with those seed words. Then you have to check that it actually recovered the correct wallet--ie. same receiving address you previously got.
@_date: 2018-05-06 15:13:04
He’s getting right down to the philosophical root issue. If you just want to be a payments platform there is no inherent reason for anyone to ‘own’ such a token. You just buy it when you need to make a payment  there is no value in ‘storing’ it. 
In that sense there is no need to use bitcoin cash just for payments. There are many coins that have ‘free’ transaction. In fact, many are better than bitcoin cash since you don’t have to wait 10 minutes for a confirmation. Basically, there is no inherent ‘value’ in a ‘payments-only’ coin. 
@_date: 2018-08-31 03:41:59

Exactly my point....you store only as much USD as you need for spending purposes. Nobody in their right minds would 'store' USD with the intention of purchasing the same value with it. In only 10 years, real inflation alone would destroy a large portion of any 'value' you stored in USD.

Can you please share a little bit more information so that it can help others avoid this? What encryption program did you use? I take it was not a BIP38 encrypted private key. There are many examples posted where even a simple 5-character passphrase BIP38 encrypted key could not be broken. Can you detail more about the passphrase you used? Was it just a common word? 
Did you name the encrypted file something like 'Bitcoin Private Keys'. I am asking because even to try to crack a 'simple' encrypted passphrase is no easy feat--unless the attacker knew that there were bitcoin private keys there.

That's a pretty far reaching interpretation. At no point does the hardware wallet give you access to 'cash'. The most you could argue is that it gives you access to bitcoins. By your definition, if you are wearing a Rolex watch that is worth more than $10,000 then you should declare that as 'currency' also. It doesn't make sense.
A debit card allows actual access to 'cash' and if you carry your debit card and your bank account in your home country has more than $10,000 you don't declare that you are bringing with you 'currency' of $10,000.

There was a prediction like this in summer 2014 when bitcoin was about $600--down from the Dec. 2013 high of $1200. Every single 'expert' predicted that by end of 2014 bitcoin would be AT LEAST $2500. Many were saying $5,000.
We know how THAT turned out. I like it better when all the 'experts' are predicting the death of bitcoin !!

Go to McDonald's and buy a Big Mac for the 'USD' equivalent price of $532---$1 million / $7500 = 133. So, a big Mac that now costs $4 would be $532. 
That kind of currency collapse that you are describing already happened in Venezuela--over 1 year (not  1 day), but the principle is the same. In 2014 you could buy 1 cup of coffee in Venezuela for 6 bolivares. Now the price is 870,000 bolivares for the same cup of coffee. See how it works?

You mean the CRIMINAL enterprise called Wells Fargo. They are putting bitcoin sellers in jail for selling bitcoins for cash to undercover agents who supposedly mentioned in 'coded' words how they were going to use the bitcoins to buy marijuana. 
Wells Fargo has ruined thousands and of lives and supposedly 'made' millions of dollars fraudulently and I bet you ANYTHING that NO ONE from that company will go to jail. The bitcoin sellers on localbitcoins hurt no one and yet they are in jail. In any sane universe, that ENTIRE company should be shut down. 
Warren Buffett is a huge POS and the biggest hypocrite on the planet. I can only hope that he lives long enough to be forced to eat his words on bitcoin--which he will do just like all the Wall St. bastards will do because they will try to appropriate bitcoin in order to make money.

Sadly, it WILL DEFINITELY have to come to this. Sooner or later--most likely later when it becomes clear that SegWit will NOT be activated by the current miners. 
At some point there's going to have to be a 'Decentralized Bitcoin' coin and a 'Huge Block Bitcoin' Coin. No other way. 
At first transactions will be cheap on the Huge block bitcoin and nobody will care that it's centralized--until the time that they will care. Later on, they will also have to remove the 21 million coin limit on the Huge Block coin in order to continue the 'reward subsidy' forever since transaction fees will be so low.

I strongly disagree. I don't think that everyone accepts that we will have to switch to layer 2 solutions at all. That's the heart of this debate. 
The fact is that many people see layer 2 solutions as not being 'really' bitcoin because in the classical sense they think that every single transactions needs to be on the blockchain. They don't care if the block size needs to be gigabytes big--not just megabytes big. The only problem with this approach is that it will necessarily require 'large data centers' to make it work. Not just large ones but huge ones. Their response? So What?
Well the so what is that those data centers will be vulnerable to government pressure and control. Don't believe that? Look what's happening to Coinbase--and that's a relatively small company in the general sense. Imagine the government pressure on large data centers to censor transactions. 
Those same people supporting large block sizes don't seem to understand that a centralized bitcoin is no longer 'really' bitcoin either. 
So how do you resolve this debate? You don't. And you can't. There will just have to be 2 versions of bitcoin--a decentralized version that functions as a settlement layer and a 'super huge block size one' where everything is on the blockchain. There is no other way.
@_date: 2017-02-03 15:05:12
I kind of have to agree. If it's so horrible, then why is the price increasing? Why isn't everyone using Monero or whatever the new coin of the day will be? 
The only factual thing that has occurred is that transactions fees have gone up. But have they gone up so much that bitcoin is unusable? I don't think so.
@_date: 2017-02-21 22:41:40
I just think this needs repeating. This is a very critical concept that very few people understand. It helps the network more to have a node that you actually use for your wallet--even if that node relays very few transactions and does very little uploading and downloading of the blockchain data to other nodes.
Many people think that having a node that just sits there relaying transactions and verifying blocks and feeding data to other nodes is more important to 'help' the network even though they NEVER use that node for their wallet. 
It would help 'the network' more if they used their own node to receive and send transactions.
@_date: 2017-02-16 15:29:10
They are not stopping withdrawals in order to upgrade AML. They are doing it to upgrade their bitcoin tracking systems. They will not be allowing customers to withdraw to a personal wallet the customer controls. They will only allow them to withdraw to 'approved' wallets or approved addresses. Just watch. This has nothing to do with money laundering and everything to do with currency control. 
Same thing will be happening in many countries--especially European countries as the Euro begins to collapse in the next few years.
@_date: 2017-02-21 17:29:31
I think the difference is not just about feelings related to Core--they want bitcoin to be a payment system with quick, and cheap transactions. Like Paypal. 
They don't really care that in order to get to this level, it may result in centralization. The problem, of course, is that bitcoin will have no real value under that system. You just 'buy' bitcoin when you need to make a payment and you 'sell' bitcoin once you receive the payment. The underlying system will still be the standard fiat system. I'm sure banks and financial companies will love this type of bitcoin.
Without decentralization and being able to be free of government control bitcoin has no value. I think many people just don't understand this and so they just want to build another Paypal. One that eventually will have the same type of government restrictions imposed on it like Paypal-- or like Coinbase. What's the point of that?
@_date: 2017-02-10 19:47:37
This statement is a lesson to all that decentralization should be placed above all else as the main feature of bitcoin. Decentralization so that (hopefully) it becomes more immune to government pressure. Decentralization is more important than 'cheap transactions'.

Yes I meant have your personal wallet send and receive transactions through your node. Technically that helps the network more than just a node that sits there relaying transactions and feeding blocks to other nodes. But, anything helps.

This issue is complicated by the fact that there are clearly people within the BU camp that really just want to see bitcoin fail. They have heavily invested in 'alternatives' to bitcoin--the coin of the day for many of them seems to be Monero right now. About a year ago all you would read about was how Ethereum was going to supplant bitcoin. In the next few months I suspect it will be zcash. After that, who knows. 
I really hate conspiracy theories, but I don't like the fact that many of the developers of BU are heavily invested in  and involved with the development of coins that they see as bitcoin replacements.

I'll try to be more helpful. Either one should be good. They are similar but not equal. Keepkey has a nicer screen and build-quality. Main difference is that Trezor allows you to make multiple wallets by adding a 'passphrase'. 
If you enter the a different passphrase a different wallet appears. Why is this useful? Because if someone forces you to reveal your Trezor seed phrase you can enter the seed and then enter a different passphrase and you will get a wallet that you created that has a small amount of bitcoin. They will think that's your main Trezor wallet. Your real wallet will have a different passphrase. 
If you don't need this feature, then Keepkey is fine.

Good questioin. The answer is that for the vast majority of people making simple transactions (eg. buying coffee) bitcoin SHOULD NOT be used. A decentralized payment system will NEVER be able to compete with a centralized one in terms of cost or efficiency. 
However, if you DO want to use it, you still can--using layer 2--things like Lightning which should be substantially cheaper to use and are still decentralized.
I know lightning doesn't exist YET--that's why Segwit will effectively double the blocksize ON-CHAIN right now. That should at least help to keep fees down while Lightning is implemented. SegWit is really a truly amazing improvement--the only thing keeping it from being activated is politics--that's it. Nothing more.

I think that many people are confused about bitcoin. When Warren Buffett was asked about bitcoin, he dismissed bitcoin itself because he said it's just a payment mechanism--like checks. It can be used to move 'value' around but a check itself is not worth anything. He's wrong because he doesn't really understand bitcoin. The value in bitcoin comes from the creation of the decentralized, trustless bitcoin blockchain. On top of this blockchain, bitcoin can exist as a currency, but also as other things--eg. smart contracts. 
If you want to scale bitcoin to greater levels by increasing the blocksize to huge amounts, then you can do it but you will destroy the decentralized nature of the blockchain because only large data centers will be able to run nodes. If this is what you want, then there is no reason at all to have a decentralized blockchain. You can just have Coinbase make a centralized CoinbaseCoin and it can be sent anywhere in the world more efficiently than Bitcoin can--you can have thousands of 'free' transaction. There will be no need for mining or for decentralized nodes. Of course, it will be controlled by Coinbase and if Coinbase decides that it doesn't like to have you send those 'CoinbaseCoins' to a particular site, then tough luck. If the government tells Coinbase to freeze your CoinbaseCoins, then it will happen instantly. This centralized system would be very efficient at scaling and sending 'digital' CoinbaseCoins but it would NOT be Bitcoin. It would be another centralized, payment system—like Paypal or Visa. If you see no value in the decentralized, trustless nature of bitcoin and the blockchain, then I don't think you ever really understood bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-21 15:22:24
If you think bitcoin the goal of bitcoin is just to be 'as easy to use as a bank card' then you have missed the whole point. It's supposed to be a new form of money that will replace the current system. For that to actually happen there has to come a point where there will be a complete breakdown in people's trust in government. It won't happen in the USA first. But you can already see this happening in many countries around the world--eg. Venezuela, Egypt, Turkey, China. Europe will be next.
It won't happen quickly either--maybe it will take more than 25 years...but it will happen eventually. It has to. It's the natural result of governments printing a ton of worthless fiat. The average life of a fiat currency is about 50 years or so--but they all have to die eventually.

I don't think bitcoin can make any difference against government regulation as long as you need to convert the bitcoin to fiat. That's the choke point. Bitcoin would only work if the business could then use bitcoin to pay for all its expenses. Can you imagine what Coinbase or Bitpay or even Gemini exchange would do in this situation? They would all immediately shut down  the DFS account. Actually Coinbase wouldn't have to shut  down their account since they probably wouldn't have opened it in the first place.

If what you are saying is true, then you should become a miner with your own node and then set the software to give you a block reward of 100 bitcoins for every block you find. Brilliant right? See what happens then and you will understand the power that individual users running their own nodes have. You are wrong to say that as an individual user with a node you have no power--you actually have a check on what miners can do by rejecting invalid blocks--like the one that gives them 100 bitcoins per block.
@_date: 2017-03-16 22:11:09
I have to say that a proposal like this is not really even feasible if you don't have a clear majority of the hash rate. If we had 90% miner hash rate signaling for segwit and only a tiny minority were 'blocking' it, then something like this might make sense. At this point though, I think it's way too premature.

Wait a minute, if you are actually using the node to receive and accept transactions then you are DEFINITELY helping the network by validating your transactions--even if you are not helping by relaying other transactions or allowing others to share data from you. You are still really helping--as long as you actually use the node !!!

I can't help but think that SOMETHING is going on at Coinbase. The CEO’s lack of understanding about how Bitcoin actually works is just mind boggling. It's almost as if he thought Bitcoin was one thing and only now he's slowly discovering how it actually works and he's realizing he had made a bunch of assumptions that were wrong. 
Basically, Coinbase wants unlimited, free transactions. If the only way to accomplish this is by centralizing nodes, then so be it. All they care about is turning Bitcoin into an ‘internet money’ type of Paypal system with Coinbase and a few other large companies as the ‘clearing house’. I think he would be better off just creating CoinbaseCoin for this purpose.

The job of regulators is to create more regulations. Every year they have to make more and more rules. Every rule creates more subrules. At first it always starts with 'simple' and 'common sense' regulations. Before you know it you are spending more time on regulations than on the business. At that point it's not worth it to even be in business. This is what happens when most politicians come from a legal background instead of a business background. 
It sounds simplistic to say but the honest truth is that those regulatory departments have to be defunded or have their budgets massively cut. They can't be changed or 'improved'.

The reason for not raising the block size is that it was a hard fork and that was dangerous. Fine. I believe that. But the current situation is dangerous also. Seguir WILL NOT activate under these conditions. Not even as UASF without a clear mining majority. So in the meantime Bitcoin stagnates and altcoins rise. 
Enough of this ! Just do a 2mb block increase with Segwit. Not everyone in the other camp will be happy. Not everyone here will be. But the vast majority of people in both camps will agree !

You can have zero or super low fees but then you MUST have a perpetually inflating currency with a never-ending block reward.

Ok..I think that's an exageration. I think that Segwit should activate first and then we can see. BUT, if the alternative is to have a contentious hard fork with people that control 80% of the hashrate (this remains to be seen), then increasing the block size (along with Segwit) is a NO BRAINER. It'a much better option than going through a contentious fork.

Yes...Everyone keeps forgetting this part of the Satoshi quote. Satoshi is a very smart man. He could have said acceptance of blocks, but he didn't. He actually said  "expressing their acceptance of VALID blocks by working on extending them and rejecting INVALID blocks by refusing to work on them." BU will be rejected by the vast majority of nodes as invalid blocks. It's that simple. The miners can keep mining it if they want--but they won't be valid blocks. And if the exchanges won't update their nodes for it, then the miners won't even be able to sell it.

Maybe, but to be fair, he is running a business where transaction fees matter and he felt that the rapid rise in fees was hurtful. It's not wrong for anyone to be self-interested in a business matter. That does not make him someone who is hostile to bitcoin.

A hard fork at all or a contentious one? I really favor a prepared planned hardfork that would please a large segment of the community. 
It's clear that segwit as is, while great from a technical point of view, is too contentious to be adopted. So what do we do? Keep going in circles? 
Why not just do a block size increase along with segwit? It would be the best thing for everyone. Nobody gets everything they want, but there will at least be a way forward.
@_date: 2017-03-26 19:55:13
I agree. However every single coffee doesn't need to be on the blockchain--it can't be without compromising the security of the system. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 18:46:09
Actually Erik has been amazingly rational in this whole debate. He has stated explicitly that he DOES NOT support BU and that he would favor a 2MB+segwit hard fork from Core. 
I know that a hardfork is dangerous and that 2MB + Segwit might might mean up to 8MB blocks, but if BU gets over 50% hashrate and a contentious hard fork might be coming, then the option of 2MB+Segwit is entirely reasonable and better than a contentious hard fork. This would be a disaster for ALL of bitcoin. 
But, I don't think this option will be acceptable to the BU side anymore. Oh well.
@_date: 2019-03-21 00:13:59
Of course you’re right. It’s just I read about many people who keep them in a safe and only use them for HODLing, which is reasonable. So, for those people sending to the same address is a huge convenience.

I don't understand why people can't see that a strong, decentralized system is the only distinguishing factor between bitcoin and all the other altcoins. It's the only thing that really gives bitcoin value. Sure ETH has smart contracts, but bitcoin will have much better functionality in this area once segwit activates. 
If you are not decentralized then you can be coerced and/or censored--you might as well use Paypal then as a value transfer network.

EXACTLY. In this scenario the culprit would be understanding the program's source of randomness. 
If the private key is generated offline, then even if there is malware in the paper wallet generator, the malware won't be able to transmit the private keys back to the hackers. So that's not a problem.
However, limiting internet access does not protect you if the program is using a 'weak' random number generator. In that case, the private key that it generates will be weak and your bitcoins will be stolen by the many bots that are constantly scanning the blockchain looking for addresses whose private keys were generated using weak randomness. 
So, bottom line, unless you REALLY REALLY know what you are doing, don't use paper wallets. Just use hardware wallets.
@_date: 2019-03-27 01:05:05
Bitcoin and cash (USD) are fundamentally opposed. USD is currently created as debt at the whim of the govt. 
Bitcoin is decentralized and it’s  supply cannot be manipulated—by anyone. This feature makes bitcoin a better ‘cash’ than cash. Bitcoin is real money. Cash is debt that can be inflated by politicians. Which do you prefer to have?
@_date: 2019-03-27 01:46:00
Fair enough. All I can tell you is that you REALLY don’t understand bitcoin. You think you do—but you don’t. I hope for your sake that bitcoin does NOT become successful. As the saying goes, you can’t insulate yourself from the effect of others using harder money than yours. Bitcoin doesn’t change in value. One bitcoin is always 1 bitcoin. It only fluctuates against other currencies—like USD. 
I can see one clear scenario where bitcoin will fail—when politicians decide to stop spending money they don’t have by borrowing from future generations and from deflating the current value of fiat currencies. If that happens then you will be right and there will be no need for bitcoin. I strongly doubt it will occur.

Money can be used as a medium of exchange--eg. you can use gold to pay for things. But money has the additional property of being a store of value. Fiat currency that is based on debt like the USD can never be that since it is always being debased. Bitcoin is not that yet--but it is trying to become that.
@_date: 2016-01-30 13:11:42
My impression is that the MAIN objective to a 2MB block size increase right now is that it has to be done via a hard fork and this is a dangerous path UNLESS there is a CRITICAL flaw that requires a hard fork. I think if a 2MB increase could be done without a hard fork, it would have been done already. Increasing to 2MB right now via hard fork is not viewed as CRITICAL. I must say I kind of agree.
@_date: 2019-03-27 04:58:04
It depends on how you define money. I define money as a store of value and define dollar bills as fiat currency--ie. NOT money. They are actually debt instruments that we use as a means of exchange. 
Whether bitcoin is a payment system or not depends on how you define payment system. I define it as something that make Visa-level transactions per second. Bitcoin can't do this right now and thus it is NOT a payment system under that definition. 
I completely agree that with Lightning bitcoin has the potential of being money AND a payment system that can rival Visa. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 22:13:50
Ok..that's fine, I respect that. But a solution that 80% of people can agree on is fine. We don't have to have everyone agree. Again, a contentious hard fork would be the worst option.
@_date: 2019-03-27 01:39:11
Ok. Great. Then bitcoin is a payment system too. Although it’s a super crappy one because it wasn’t designed with the priority of transferring payments quickly. It was designed to transfer a value token in a decentralized system and it does that very well. 
@_date: 2019-03-27 23:23:25
I just checked. You absolutely can withdraw to bc1 addresses. But for deposit they use 3 segwit addresses. 
@_date: 2019-03-04 22:30:51
Unless you know exactly how the program is generating randomness, then I will disagree that a paper wallet printed offline is secure. It would be secure from malware that wants to transmit the private key back to some hackers. But, how is it secure from bad programming? What if the program you are using to create the paper wallet has a 'weak' random number generator? 
In that case there is no maliciousness involved, but you will lose your bitcoins anyways. There are many bots scanning the blockchain looking for addresses whose private keys were generated using weak randomness. Those bitcoins will be stolen even if there was no malice intended by the person that made the paper wallet generator. 
@_date: 2017-03-21 01:21:47
I think that's a great idea--I was thinking of a 2mb hard fork with 50% discount so that it starts at 4. Your idea is even better. I just wish there were serious discussions with the goal of finding common ground. The differences in opinion are not THAT insurmountable.
@_date: 2017-03-17 19:50:45
I like what you are trying to do. I am pretty sure that you and Roger and all the people that have been there since the very beginning want bitcoin to succeed. I don't believe that Roger is evil or wants to destroy bitcoin. 
I do believe that he is upset that bitcoin is changing--it certainly doesn't feel like the same bitcoin as before. However, the bitcoin of before never had so many users. Additionally, while bitcoin is changing, it may actually be changing for the better. There are many serious improvements to bitcoin that Segwit will enable. 
If segwit activates and there are still problems with high transaction fees and slow confirmations after that then Roger will be in a much stronger position to push for additional changes at that point.
@_date: 2019-03-27 21:32:27

Please keep us updated. Most likely thing is that they will send them through any of the KYC exchanges and the exchange won't give them any problems.

@_date: 2017-03-21 18:20:21
I am inclined to agree with you--only because I think a lot of people here and in r/btc are massively underestimating how disastrous a contentious hard fork would be. It needs to be avoided and if the price to pay is something like this, then so be it.

Wrong. Just because there are bitcoins at the address associated with it doesn’t mean anything. How do you know someone else doesn’t have a copy of the private key and therefore can take those bitcoins at any time? So, in the end you really never know.

It doesn't matter. The purpose of bitcoin is not just as a mere payment system. Unless bitcoin fails, you are supposed to be 'saving' money in bitcoin for the future. It's like money that you can actually save without it being devalued.
I know that sounds ridiculous when it has dropped over 80% in one year--but it sounded just as ridiculous when people were saying this in 2011 and 2012 and 2013 and 2014 and 2015 and 2016...etc. In 4-5 years people will be saying they wish they could have bought bitcoin for $4,000 or even $20,000 per bitcoin.

I can't help but think that SOMETHING is going on at Coinbase. The CEO’s lack of understanding about how Bitcoin actually works is just mind boggling. It's almost as if he thought Bitcoin was one thing and only now he's slowly discovering how it actually works and he's realizing he had made a bunch of assumptions that were wrong. 
You see, according to his own statements, raising the blocksize to 2MB or even 4MB won’t be enough. So, why the constant posts about installing Classic if 2MB won’t make much of a difference? Because he now desperately wants to takeover Bitcoin in order to turn it into another Paypal with Coinbase in control—this is so patently obvious I can’t believe more people don’t see this. He basically wants unlimited, cheap transactions with Coinbase as the 'clearing house'. If this can best be accomplished by centralizing nodes, then so be it. I'm sorry but the centralized control that he wants is NOT Bitcoin. He should just make CoinbaseCoin and convince people and retailers to use that as free, fast 'internet money'. Hell he could do away with mining all together then ! 
@_date: 2019-03-26 20:03:04
No. You can use it to pay someone but it’s not a payment system. Bitcoin is money—hard money. PayPal is a payment system. You should read The Bitcoin Standard book to understand the difference.

Unfortunately, it's because it is so centralized that it won't just 'go away'. What many people see as a critical flaw will be seen as a rallying cry and a sign of strength. Once these issues have crossed the lines from objective, scientific measures into politics, then everything goes. What matters is what you can convince people of--not what the actual truth may be.

Dude...this is getting repetitive. I feel like we are going in circles so I will just say it for the last time. Whether you believe in 2MB blocks or not has NOTHING to do with 2X. 
2X was an attempt at giving control over bitcoin development to a group controlled by miners and some big companies. It was NOT about increasing the blocksize to 2MB.
Secondly, it was the miners who agreed to activate segwit. There was no promise made by anyone about agreeing to any hardfork afterwards. This whole 'agreement' you keep mentioning did not involve any of the bitcoin developers or the users. 
Some users ran software which was going to start rejecting blocks that were not signaling for segwit. The miners/businesses then developed the 2X software to activate segwit. No one else made any agreement with them. They did this on their own so there was no 'agreement' about any hardfork with anyone but themselves. I think you need to understand this point so you don't keep using circular logic. 
Also, you should know that segwit WAS A BLOCK SIZE INCREASE. It's evident to everyone now. So, the block size was indeed increased. Like I said before, you say you are a supporter of bitcoin but you should really try to understand it more.

Bitcoin has a built in system for transferring its token. This system has safeguards against double spending and making sure that decentralized keepers of the ledger stay in sync. The qualities necessary for this transfer system to work make it very good for transferring bitcoin securely but crappy as a ‘payment system’ in comparison to other current payment systems—eg. PayPal or Visa. Bitcoins transfer system was not meant to compete with them as its main feature.

You got your timing wrong. When the crisis started he bought a ton of ‘cheap’ assets—then all those ‘assets’ tanked and all those companies were on the verge of bankruptcy. That’s when he started begging for a bailout. Which of course he got. Then all the Wall St. Scumbags (along with Buffett) got to profit massively from the mess they created. The profits were privatized for them—after they socialized the losses. Bullshit.

Good post to review basic information. However, in this age of hardware wallets I think it’s important to emphasize to beginner HODLers that they can send bitcoins to a receive address generated by their hardware wallet multiple times. 
Example - you buy a Trezor or Ledger and set it up. You write down your seed by hand on a piece of paper—don’t try to be smart and encrypt it and store it in the cloud. Just write it down multiple times and store the seed words in various locations. Then go to the receive tab and generate a ‘receive’ address. This address can be stored in the cloud or you can even bookmark it. Now let’s say you buy 0.1 BTC and you send it to this address. Then a few weeks later you buy 0.2 BTC—you can also send those to this SAME receive address. You don’t have to connect your hardware wallet and generate another receive address. This way if your hardware wallet is in a safe you don’t have to keep taking it out every time you buy bitcoins to generate a new receive address.

You REALLY don't understand what occurred. 2X was NOT about increasing the blocksize to 2MB. The way the entire concept was conceived (secret meeting in NYC among the 'key' players) is at the root of the problem. 
Bitcoin doesn't have any 'key' players. If 2X had succeeded it would have been the end of bitcoin and the creation of a new company-controlled coin. If you want that then you can look at Coinmarketcap and pick literally any other coin (except maybe Monero) and you will have a company-controlled coin. There is plenty of those around--they more properly called shitcoins.

I only linked that so you could learn from it since he explains the concept in a simple way. If you don't want to, that's ok. I don't need anyone else to support my position. Like I said before, it's all about defining the terms. To me, money is something you can use to store your labor into so that it can be available to you in the future. That's not USD because it loses value with time--it MUST lose value as its supply is increased constantly by new USD being generated. 
Gold is money because it can store value over time. Bitcoin is trying to become a store of value. It's obviously not there yet. 
But it's ok. We just disagree. Good luck.

I have been reading a lot of comments about all the 'good' that government does and how the EU is the epitome of a model of good government. That NY Times article was just published today so I thought gives a good insight of how even the 'good' governments are rife with corruption.

It’s a CERTAINTY the genesis block bitcoins won’t move—even Satoshi with the private key couldn’t move them. I don’t know whether Satoshi purposely programmed it this way or if it was a coding error but they cannot be moved. The Genesis address is a great burner address.

Bitcoin is the ONLY cryptocurrency that matters in a monetary sense. 99% of all others are outright scams. The fact that you don't understand why this is so means you don't really understand crypto. 
I can state the reason for this in simple terms, but you still won't understand it. If you want a detailed answer, you should read The Bitcoin Standard. Here is a simple answer:
Any cryptocurrency that is controlled by a 'foundation' or a small group of individuals or by some 'corporation' is basically a scam. Bitcoin is the only crypto that is truly decentralized and if a cryptocurrency is not decentralized then it has no reason for really existing other than as an elaborate scam. 
@_date: 2019-03-27 05:20:22
Fair enough. Then under that definition, bitcoin is a payment system--a super slow payment system. But it is very efficient at securely transferring bitcoins in a decentralized system which also prevents double spending. 
@_date: 2019-11-04 14:57:20
He's your typical buttcoiner--the guy knew about bitcoin in 2012 and yet STILL chooses not to understand it. In any case, I can't wait until the price of BTC goes over $20k. That will just kill the narrative for all these morons. How many times can you keep saying it's just like the 'Tulip bubble'. 
Show me a true 'bubble' that deflated and then re-inflated again. So, once the price of BTC goes over the previous ATH then the narrative that it's just like Tulips will just die. But, somehow I think it will keep being resurrected by morons like this guy. They are just terrified of a non-government controlled currency.
These idiots don't understand that bitcoin is undergoing a process of monetization--something that has not been seen in over 5,000 years. Therefore, it is perfectly normal to say that bitcoin is in a 'bubble' but it's still UNDERVALUED at the same time. I mean bitcoin was in a bubble when it went from nothing to $1 and then back down again, and it was also a bubble when it from $3 to $30 and back down again. Same thing when it went from $1,000 to $20k and back down again. Those periods were indeed 'bubbles' but the underlying asset of BTC was still undervalued even at those prices.

Not his handling of the business, but rather his decision to get involved in politics. Had he just stuck to making ASICs then Bitmain would still be super successful. The main problem was that he got addicted to all the ill-gotten gains from the covert ASICBoost. But he should have seen the forest for the trees and just given up on ASICboost and adopted Segwit immediately. Oh well. 
@_date: 2019-03-26 21:53:28
Of course you can spend it. And then you should replace it because it’s real money and not a debt instrument like cash. But it’s main purpose is not as a payment system. 
Satoshi did not create bitcoin as a replacement for PayPal. He created it as a new type of money. Again, read The Bitcoin Standard to understand the difference between real money (like bitcoin or gold) and a debt instrument like USD. 
@_date: 2019-03-27 02:55:36
I can think of how bitcoin will fail—when politicians decide to stop spending money they don’t have by borrowing from future generations and when they stop deflating the current value of fiat currencies by printing more. If that happens then there will be no need for bitcoin. I strongly doubt it will occur.

None of the trades done at an exchange appear on the blockchain. They’re internal adjustments made in the books of the exchange. That’s why you have to trust the exchange not to be lying. The only transactions that appear on the blockchain are when you deposit bitcoins or withdraw bitcoins. Your ‘balance’ at unregulated exchanges is completely meaningless until you are actually able to withdraw it to your own wallet.

I’m assuming you don’t want to register for an official exchange because that would be the easiest way. If that’s the case, then the next Best thing is to use HODL HODL  —a person to person exchange. Find someone n your area that wants to buy BTC and pay by cash.  Then arrange to meet them at a coffee shop. Another option is to use BISQ—this is a software program that gives you access to a similar decentralized exchange. You can also find a bitcoin ATM that buys bitcoin and gives you cash.

I disagree that this is how bitcoin is 'supposed' to work. If so, ask yourself then why all the miners can't get together and simply activate a fork that gives them 100 bitcoins as a block reward?

I think most sophisticated bitcoin enthusiasts know that the idea that 'regular' people are buying bitcoin because of 'Cyprus' or 'Brexit' doesn't make any sense. However, you can't underestimate the impact of China. The price has been recently driven up by interest from China in the past few months--but not because of Yuan devaluation fears but rather for speculation and gambling. 
As far as government involvement in the creation of bitcoin, I think you are completely wrong on that. The reason it hasn't been attacked like E-gold is simply because there isn't a central 'Bitcoin Inc.' company to go after. However, they are going after specific companies. Notice what has been occurring at Coinbase lately--they are closing accounts left and right for ridiculous reasons. Obviously they are being targeted by someone. 
Finally, I don't think the Satoshi coins will move. I think Satoshi is a true scholar and idealist who is not interested in 'making money' off bitcoin. There is NO WAY in the world that Craig Wright is Satoshi--no matter what Gavin and others think.

Well, it appears you have it all figured out. All I can tell you is that bitcoin is on a path (perhaps a very long one) to creating a new form of money--real money that is not based on debt. It is not the goal of bitcoin to replace the USD as a currency. It's real goal is to create a new financial system that is not controlled by the whims of politicians. Maybe bitcoin will fail. We will see.
@_date: 2017-08-12 10:52:31
Sorry about the confusion. I am just speculating. Right now you can think of bitcoin as 1X. Segwit activated because over 90% of the miners are running something called Segwit2X--the 2X part is a hard fork to increase the block size to 2MB (I am simplifying here). Many people don't agree with this change, but a hard fork to 2MB is coming for sure. Therefore, when it does occur many people will stay behind in a 1X bitcoin. Right now you have 1X bitcoins and if a fork occurs to 2X then you will get 2X bitcoins as well. I know this is still confusing if you are new, but it's the quickest explanation I can give you. 
@_date: 2019-03-29 00:08:12
Real money should also be able to 'store' that labor so that you can work less in the future. That is you work a very hard when you are young and then you 'store' that work in money so that when you are older you can work less. The current 'money' we have today (USD) is good for trading labor but not very good for storing labor. Bitcoin is trying to become a better type of money than USD.

Again, you don't REALLY understand bitcoin--like **AT ALL**. Who are the 'many' you are talking about? Companies? Who cares--companies are not what bitcoin is about and they don't control bitcoin. 
The whole fiasco COULD NOT have been avoided since it had nothing to do with bitcoin. This was just a group of companies and miners that got together thinking that if they all worked out some agreement among each other they could change bitcoin to whatever they wanted. I guess they learned a lesson.
All those companies shouldn't feel bad--I mean they can still get together and change many coins. Look at BCH, BSV, ETH, and all the rest. They are all basically controlled by a few companies and individuals. Not bitcoin. That's what makes bitcoin so different from all those shitcoins.

Yes, but that's a SECONDARY reason. The main reason they can't do that is because nodes will reject all those transactions as invalid and won't relay them. Anyone who thinks that miners can dictate a hardfork by themselves doesn't really understand how bitcoin is supposed to work.

Not true. Bitcoin thrived for many years before Tether existed. In fact, before Tether, bitcoin was Tether--everyone used bitcoin to trade altcoins.

Ok...but this is a fundamentally different vision of bitcoin--it is no longer a peer to peer currency. Direct peer to peer payments without the need for an intermediary was the main feature that made bitcoin be what it is today--along with the limited supply.

This is a VERY OLD debate that's very tiring to keep reading about. Basically, is bitcoin a store of value (because of it's digital scarcity) or is it simply a fancy 'new' payment method. Which has to come first--the payment method or the store of value?
I had this argument DIRECTLY with Roger a long time ago. He told me  he basically wants bitcoin to become Paypal 2.0. I told him there is no value in holding bitcoin if people just want to use it as a means of payment. If it's just a payment method then you convert your cash to bitcoin when you want to make a payment and the recipient converts to cash as soon as they receive the bitcoin. It makes no difference what the price of bitcoin is if it's only a payment method--you just convert the amount you need to 'transfer'. There is no reason to 'hold' any bitcoin then.
I couldn't get him to understand that it needs to become a store of value first and then a payment method. It's only when it's a store of value that people will WANT to accept it as a payment method. 
Roger fundamentally believes that there is 'value' in having bitcoin as a payment system (like Paypal) and NO ONE can convince him otherwise.

Good luck with it. I want you guys to succeed. But, I wouldn't bring a large amount of 'cash' to meet an unknown party. And if I wanted to do a large bitcoin transfer with them, I would rather take a mobile phone wallet since if they steal the phone they won't have access to the coins and you can just recover the wallet to a different phone.
I also think there should be some protection in it against loss or confiscation--if you are traveling with a Trezor or Ledger and it's taken from you or lost, then it's not a huge deal. If you lose an opendime or it is taken from you (confiscated) then you are totally screwed. 
I actually see a loaded opendime as a scary device--you have to be SUPER CAREFUL with it. I don't know that I would accept one from someone else because I would be afraid that as soon I walk away from that person, someone else who knows I have it may try to steal it. If they had just transferred the bitcoins to my mobile wallet, I would feel more safe.

Basically, once you deposit a certain amount of crypto, they start demanding 'KYC' info. Nothing wrong with that. However, it seems that NOTHING that people provide is enough to satisfy them. At that point they should just close down someone's account and return the crypto back to them. Instead they basically keep your crypto--essentially flat-out stealing.

Here is the real answer--you can do whatever you want tax wise and get away with it--as long as you are not AUDITED. The real Act 22 does NOT mention cryptocurrencies. The IRS treats crypto as an 'asset'. So, if you don't want to be in trouble with the IRS and want to have peace of mind, the this is how it works. 
Let's say you bought 1 bitcoin at $100. It's now at $6,400. When you officially move to Puerto Rico, you will have to declare your ownership of bitcoin as an asset and you will owe capital gain taxes on $6,300 of 'gains'. Here is the benefit. In 10 years, bitcoin is at $100,000 (or it could be at $100 again--who knows) and you sell at $100,000. Then you owe ZERO capital gain taxes to the IRS.

Yes..it's actually the most powerful feature of bitcoin. Warren Buffet doesn't understand this. When asked what he thought of bitcoin, he said it was a great invention as a payment system but that it should have no value. He said checks were a great financial invention, but a check is worth nothing. 
Many people don't understand the difference between creating a store of value and a simple payment system. Bitcoin as a simple payment system has no value--or I should say minimal value. The store of value characteristic and the ability to transfer it without intermediaries is the big thing about it.

I think you are missing the point completely. Visa is a CENTRALIZED payment network. Bitcoin is a DECENTRALIZED payment network.

It's NOT the goal of bitcoin to become VISA. That will not be success--it will be failure. If you are trying to turn bitcoin into Visa then you have already lost.

Again, even assuming zero confirmations, what's the point of owning bitcoins as 'savings' if they are just tokens to be used as payment. In that case, you own fiat (usd, euro, etc.) and only convert to btc when you need to make a payment. You have no need to actually own any bitcoins. The real value of bitcoins is in being able to replace fiat one day because no one will trust fiat money with their life savings. That's the true revolution--not just Paypal 2.0 or 3.0 or 4.0.

It’s finished enough. It will never be ‘polished’ because there’s no central company managing and controlling it and everything is open source so whatever you develop is available to everyone else. Why do you think that Moron Fake Satoshi is trying to patent the hell out of Bitcoin Cash—so his private company can make $ off it. 
In something centralized small groups of people can make a lot of changes quickly. Look at how Bitmain is going to radically alter the way transactions are handled in Bitcoin Cash even though the vast majority of the developers and the ‘community’ oppose this. You can’t do that kind of crap in bitcoin because it’s decentralized. When something is decentralized it’s not easy to make it ‘pretty’ and ‘simple’.

This looks obvious to me. If you support Bitcoin Cash, then it helps you tremendously to have bitcoin be unusable for simple day to day payments--and high fees and a huge transaction backlog are making bitcoin useless for this use. Segwit2X would help to lower fees immediately which segwit by itself won't do for at least 6 months or longer. 
Therefore, in fact, if you want Bitcoin Cash to thrive then you DON'T want Segwit2X.

We just had a long discussion about fees where I was basically told that bitcoin is NOT to be used for day to day payments of less than $250. I don't agree with this view, but that was the prevalent position. So, which is it going to be? Compete with Visa/MC or just stay as a 'digital gold' type of 'hodl-token' that no one transacts in?
By the way, I agree with competing with Visa/MC and keeping bitcoin as a peer to peer currency.

Yes..but would you bring a loaded opendime to meet someone you don't know for an exchange of bitcoins if you know that they can just 'steal' your opendime and then they have access to the bitcoins. At least with a phone wallet, or a hardware wallet they would need a PIN or an access code to transfer the bitcoins. With an opendime, they just need a paperclip.
If someone knows that you are carrying an opendime with a large amount of bitcoin, they can just rob you and take your coins. Also, if you lose it, whoever finds it can just take the coins.
Like I said, other than for exchanges between TRUSTED parties AND for large amounts of bitcoin, I still don't see a good use case.

Thanks for the response. I wish you guys continued success. 
I do truly believe yours is the MOST SECURE hardware wallet out there. There is a lot of FUD regarding your use of the secure element chip and I am glad you guys keep pointing out that all critical bitcoin-related operations are done outside the chip using the open source firmware. Ledger is NOT setup like that. 
I don't think Trezor gets criticized enough for the fact that the private keys can be easily extracted from their hardware wallet--ie. if the attacker knows what they are doing.

Actually what the post says is that the best you can do is USE your node to send and receive transactions. If you're already doing that, then great--your full node matters. 
If you are just running a full node to 'help the network' and are NOT using it for transactions then your full node doesn't matter and you might as well shut it off.

Explain to me why many of those nodes won't simply be left behind on a Segwit 1X chain that may have just about 5% or less hash rate. At that point, this minority chain will need to hardfork in order to adjust the difficulty and maybe even change the POW or it will be vulnerable to attack.

Separating yourself from paying USA taxes is the entire point of moving to Puerto Rico under Act 22. I think you need to look into what this is. What we are discussing here is a technical point regarding crypto under Act 22. Many USA hedge funds are now moving to Puerto Rico to avoid having to pay ANY capital gain taxes on their earnings. Act 22 is a legal loophole to separate yourself from the IRS while still remaining an American.

People do hate them NOW--for valid reasons. Basically, they have been incompetent in regards to security and this has resulted in a lot of people losing their bitcoins. Their web implementation uses Javascript and they were not following many 'best' practices. Just to give you 2 recent examples, they allowed people to create an account but then did not save the private key. People then sent funds to that address and when they tried to move the funds they were out of luck. No one had the private key to that address.
Another example was when people were creating accounts that had an very predictable 'private key' due to an error in their implementation. Hackers could then just simply 'move' those funds. This last episode is what made 'johoe' kind of famous. He basically moved a lot of people's bitcoins to his own account and then gave the bitcoins back to Blockchain.info.  I should mention this all happened before they switched to being an HD wallet.
However, in the past they were the dominant bitcoin web wallet. It's just that many people don't trust them now.

Mostly for people to move bitcoins between exchanges. Lets say you have 1 bitcoin at Coinbase and now you want to move it to another exchange (eg. Gemini). Right now the only way to do this is to withdraw 1 btc from Coinbase and send it to an address controlled by Gemini. This transaction has to be mined and recorded on the blockchain. If those 2 exchanges were using Liquid, you can withdraw your bitcoin from Coinbase and have it as a confirmed deposit in Gemini in 2 minutes--without the transaction having to go through the blockchain. 
Right now (with low fees) this may not seem like a big deal, but in the future, as there are more transactions, using something like Liquid will reduce the need for so many onchain bitcoin transfers and this will free up space on the blockchain for everyone else.

Really? ViaBTC was the main sponsor of the Bitcoin ABC fork that created Bitcoin Cash and its development was wholly funded by Jihan. Just like he funded the Monero Classic fork and a bunch of other forks that tried to get rid of his ASICS on various coins. The only reason the Bitcoin Cash fork exists today is because Jihan spent a ton of money buying those coins or else it would be dead like all the other forks he supported but ultimately failed. Jihan said last year in an ‘interview’ with Zooko about ‘openness’ that he controls both those pools.

Transferwise is great to use to wire money to banks. Ironically, you can't use it to send money to most bitcoin exchanges because they require that the money come from a bank account in your name.

This product is interesting but I have yet to find a good use case for it. Using for small amounts is absolutely impractical so all I can think of is transferring a huge amount of bitcoins to someone offchain. However, if you lose the device or it is stolen from you then you are screwed, so I don't know who would load this device with a huge amount of bitcoin to begin with. Therefore, I don't see a use case for it.

That’s probably because they assume not many wallets can send to bc1 addresses. But if you ask to withdraw to a bc1 address Coinbase is able to send to bc1 addresses. I should clarify that when talking about Coinbase I’m referring to the actual exchange—Coinbase Pro. 
@_date: 2018-10-25 01:30:54
The answer to your question is no. Once someone sends you BTC they are yours. Their possession of the private key of the address the BTC came from is irrelevant. Consider it a gift. The only thing they could potentially do is ‘track’ your bitcoins when you move your coins along with theirs. But they could have just tracked your coins anyways. Actually they don’t know they’re ‘your’ coins. They just know the bitcoin address but they don’t know who it belongs to. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:50:58
No...when you are receiving or sending transactions then you run the node to protect YOURSELF. You are not doing it for altruism and so you are happy to bear the expense because it's for your own protection. 
If you are just running a node that is not transacting in ANY economic activity, you may THINK you are helping the network, but you are not. You are honestly just wasting resources--but if it makes you FEEL better then go ahead.

I'm sorry but that's just not the case. It's not an insignificant 'minority' at all if more than 15% of people are involved. This is the reason why I think SegWit should only activate at 95% (not 51% or 75%)--and I think it will. Just not right away--but it will.

This is very unlikely because at the time the sell order was placed, bitcoin was trading for higher than $300.

At $2-3 fees per transaction bitcoin becomes impractical to use for anything less than $250 per transaction. And yet one of the top threads here was about convincing the owner of a small bakery and the owner of a cigarrete stand to accept bitcoin as payment. Who would buy a baked good that costs $5 and have to pay a $2 transaction fee? That's insane.
Lightning you say? Ok...for regular recurring purchases maybe--when it's widely available 1-2 years from now. But, what about for a one-time payment to someone or to purchase a small item? 
Basically, you are saying that bitcoin should NOT be used for transactions less than $250. 
@_date: 2018-10-01 18:18:13
I don't think so. If Tether is bad, then no one wants Tethers so people who own them will want to sell them for BTC--ie. buying BTC. Recently, the biggest exchanges that deal with Tether (Bitfinex and Binance) have had sellers of BTC 'Tethering UP'--ie. selling BTC for Tether and this has driven down the price of BTC.
Who would want to sell BTC for Tether now if they suspect that Tether is bad? Tether going down can only mean price of BTC going up.

I agree with you--1MB is not a magic number. 2 mb is probably ok. The BIG PROBLEM is that it must be done by a HARD FORK. No matter how many times it is said many people don't understand how DANGEROUS that can be if not done correctly. To do it correctly you need almost EVERYONE to agree to it. Many people won't agree with you (or me) that 2 MB might be ok--so then you have a split in the currency. 
That would be the WORST outcome. Therefore, I don't see a way forward for a HARD FORK at this time. So, we are left with Segwit, which will give about 1.7mb using a SOFT FORK. While it may not be as elegant a solution it is far more PRACTICAL. As a big bonus, Segwit also fixes a ton of other problems and creates opportunities for many new innovations--so I favor it.
@_date: 2017-08-11 14:25:48
I agree that this is what will happen--segwit 2X will hard fork with over 90% hash rate and massive economic support from many companies that are silent for now but will eagerly embrace 2X. 
At that point, the segwit 1X chain will fork and then it will need to likely fork again to change the difficulty and the POW. 
The BIG BATTLE will then ensue--which is the REAL bitcoin--segwit 2X (with massive hashrate support) or segwit 1X (now with a POW change and minimal hash rate)?
Interesting times ahead. My opinion? I will just hodl all the forks until the dust settles.

It's crazy because EVERYONE knows when the halvings will happen. It's not a secret. I remember one guy posting here how he was basically going to sell a lot of his bitcoins in May 2016 and someone told him something like 'are you crazy? The halving is about to occur. Just wait' and the seller said something like 'the halving date is well known and has been anticipated so the price is already baked-in'. Well, look how the price increased after the halving anyway. 
In a way it's crazy but many people only want to buy bitcoin when it is going up--not when it is down.
@_date: 2017-08-16 21:49:17
Well there will be some protection because the first fork block will be &gt; 2MB so any subsequent blocks built on that block can only be included on the 2X chain--ie. they will be rejected by the 1X chain.

That's a good question that I can't answer. I know you have to list specifically the number of bitcoins you own and the original cost basis of them in your application. The key question is whether you owe any capital gains tax immediately or it can be deferred. 
I don't think anyone can really give you a straight answer and whatever they tell you they did doesn't really mean much util it survives an audit. However, I do know that if you pay the capital gains taxes based on the current bitcoin price when you sign the contract with Puerto Rico then you cannot be faulted and will be in the clear. This is based on the current IRS rules. 
So, as far as the IRS is concerned it's as if you have 'sold' your bitcoins and you have paid all your taxes when you moved to Puerto Rico and any future capital tax gains are not taxable by the IRS.
@_date: 2017-08-10 15:00:38

What you are saying makes sense. It really does. HOWEVER, I heard the EXACT same thing in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2018??. This thread about the 'Wealthy Elite' was published in 2011:

I do the EXACT same thing. It looks cool and I feel like I should get one just to try it out. But then I think that this is really just a one-time use device and so I don't want to waste it. 
So, I try to think of a use case I may have for it and I just can't come up with one. You are right about the amounts of bitcoins you need to use it for--I was thinking you need to transact at least 0.5 bitcoins to make it cost effective, but I just can't come up with a reason why I would want to load 0.5 bitcoins on this thing. 
I feel it would be a lot more useful if it had the option of adding some kind of 'passphrase' to it so that if it's lost or stolen you wouldn't lose the bitcoins on it. You can then tell the passphrase to the recipient--but then they would need a way to verify that passphrase also.

The REAL argument has never been about segwit or layer-2 solutions. Everyone who truly understands bitcoin knows that both are necessary for wide-spread scaling. The key point of contention was whether the system can handle a small block size increase NOW (an increase in the non-witness size) in order to keep fees reasonable and adoption growing while those layer-2 solutions are fully implemented.
The question you have to ask yourself is if the current high fees are making bitcoin transactions RIGHT NOW impractical for many common uses and therefore that is driving people to use other altcoins. 
Layer-2 solutions ARE NOT ready and probably won't be readily available for about 1-2 years. How many potential users is bitcoin going to lose in that time? That's the question. 
But, this whole point is now irrelevant since the creation of Bitcoin Cash. Time will tell how the market will respond. The real measure will be to see where Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash (and Dash and ETH, etc.) stand relative to each other in 1-2 years.

I don't think he hates bitcoin or wants to control it. He knows enough to know he can't control it. No one can. I think he really honestly believes that bitcoin is just a simple payment system and thus the rising fees threaten that payment system. The problem with this idea is that bitcoin as a simple payment system has no real value. You could use any other alt-coin for a simple payment system. What gives bitcoin it's true value is as a store of wealth that cannot be controlled by governments. The store of value proposition is the key.
Warren Buffett was asked about bitcoin and he said it's a great invention--just like check were a great invention. But checks have no value. If bitcoin were just a simple payment system, then yes, it has no value (or minimal value).
The big divide in the community now is really about the heart of what bitcoin should be--Paypal 2.0 or a decentralized store of value. Do you value cheap transactions at all costs or do you value decentralization more? That's the key question.
@_date: 2018-10-16 00:18:10
I really don't understand why you did this. It's well known that that there are bots CONSTANTLY scanning the mempool for weak private keys. In fact, the CTO of Trezor is Joe Hoe. He became 'famous' in 2014 when blockchain.info was making addresses with weak R values and people's bitcoins were being stolen from these addresses. He basically started 'stealing' the bitcoins first and then gave all the bitcoins to blockchain.info after they fixed the problem.
This is also why no one uses brainwallets any more even though they were very popular in the past--they can be easily cracked now by sophisticated computers running rainbow tables and thus they are NOT SAFE.

Honestly, because I believe that bitcoin should REPLACE the fiat-based system. What happenned to 'Be Your Own Bank'? If we are still going to insist on keeping a bank account and a credit card, then bitcoin becomes just a 'HODL-TOKEN'. Is that what people really want?
@_date: 2018-06-08 02:38:08
Let’s say you click on the ‘receive’ section of your wallet and it shows you address A. So you give this address to someone and they send you some bitcoin to address A. Then later someone else wants to send you bitcoins so you click on the ‘receive’ section and it shows you address B. You can give this other person address A or address B. You can always still send coins to address A even if you last used it months ago and you are on receive address Z. It’s not good practice to do this but you can do it. If you want you can keep handing out address A forever as your receive address.

Honestly, this is really the best course of action at this point. By 'this point' I mean the fact that most of the developers pushing for BU are clearly involved in alt-coin creation and promotion. I just don't see how anyone in the bitcoin world can take them seriously now that it's clear that most are involved in this Zcash thing. The only way for Zcash to succeed is for them to say bitcoin is 'crippled' in terms of fungibility. Of course SegWit is the first step toward working to improve bitcoin fungibility, so it's in their FINANCIAL interest block SegWit in order to cripple bitcoin. 
They should just release BU as a separate 'BBB' fork chain (Big Block Bitcoin) and if they are truly correct then most bitcoin miners will install BBB and pretty soon BBB will become the 'better bitcoin' they all want. Users will all migrate there and they can finally say the 'won'. They speak with such confidence--they should do it.
Of course they won't succeed because they already failed before, but they will create delays which helps them pump their alt-coins. Really sad to see. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 16:03:09
I would have agreed with you previously but the difference is that now there are groups with a lot of money that think they can make more money by attacking bitcoin.

The phrase 'We are all Craig Wright' is a plan on 'We are all Satoshi'. I knew that Roger supported Craig, but I thought this was because Craig talked loudly about the need for a blocksize increase.

@_date: 2016-12-03 15:51:12
Is there an online tool where you would enter the seed words and it would give you the actual Master private key that you could then import into ANY wallet? Or even easier, a place where you put in the seed words and it give you the INDIVIDUAL addresses that have any unspent outputs along with the private keys for those addresses?

Be careful. Almost all credit card processors have changed their policies and are now processing bitcoin purchase transactions as credit card 'cash advance' transactions. 
Those transactions have a hefty fee added at the time of the purchase and they start charging exorbitant interest rates from the time the charge is assessed--no grace period to pay it off at the end of the month.

I fully agree. The ultimate goal of bitcoin is to not care about the price in USD because there will be no need to convert to USD and no need for exchanges. Things will just be valued in bitcoin, which is more like what 'real' money should be.
@_date: 2018-06-28 16:44:24
Don't do option 1--too much room for error. You could make a mistake in the send address or the fees will be too low and you will wait a long time. And there is no need if you will be sending back to the original seed. 
The way to do it is to get a second Trezor, plug that in and update the firmware. Then when it asks you to set it up, pick the option to 'recover wallet' . Don't pick 'Create a New Wallet'. Then it will ask you to enter your recovery seed. Once it's done it will be a clone of the old Trezor. Both will work and both will show your funds. 
Once you confirm the second Trezor shows your funds, you can do whatever you want with the old one. You can update the firmware and set it up as a new wallet or you can also 'recover' it again and then you will have 2 Trezors with updated firmware that are clones of each other. You can even setup different PINs on each one--but they will both control the same funds.
@_date: 2018-06-07 14:51:41
Yeah...and this is the same guy that keeps saying how EOS (a clear scam) has 'great' potential !! This guy just got lucky by investing in ETH very early on because of personal relationships (not because he even cared about crypto) and now he thinks he is actually an 'expert' in crypto.

@_date: 2019-08-21 15:52:40
I kind of agree. Businesses will start accepting bitcoin when they decide that bitcoin is actually something valuable. We are not quite there yet. The next step will be for them to accept it and deliberately retain some portion of it as bitcoin instead of just converting to USD. The step after that will be when businesses can pay their suppliers with bitcoin. At that point the loop will be almost closed.

Before the run up to $1260 so during 2012-13 I used to visit r/buttcoin almost daily. There were so many scammers and clear scams targeting bitcoin users that I would actually learn a lot from that sub because they were good at pointing them out. Of course it was done in the context of all of bitcoin is a scam but I still learned a lot. As more and more ‘reputable’ companies got into bitcoin and more professional exchanges came along the scammers were driven to the fringes. 
After the massive 2017 pump which honestly was kind of unexpected all the posts in r/buttcoin just became bitter and angry. I rarely go there now. Same with r/BTC.

There are financial meltdowns happening even now. Look what happened in Venezuela and what is happening now in Turkey, Iran, Colombia, Russia, China. There have been significant currency devaluations in those places. 
It's just that bitcoin is still at a very early stage and not very user friendly or well understood.
@_date: 2018-06-18 14:30:10
They don't add transactions to the hash. They hash the transactions with themselves to form a type of 'tree'--a Merkle tree. Then they do a hash of all those transactions to get a Merkle root. That Merkle root is part of the block header. Then they add a nonce to is the block header and then hash that. If they don't get the correct value, they change the nonce and rehash the block header with it. 
The reason why a 'hash' of the transactions is included in the block header is that this is critical for SPV wallets to use. It's really amazingly ingenious--I have to give it to Satoshi. Just freaking brilliant !!
@_date: 2018-10-16 22:15:38


You don't understand bitcoin !! Bitcoin is the ONLY system that can do that. When it comes to something that has 'value' like money, you want decentralization and security above all. No other system in the world today comes even close to bitcoin as a decentralized peer to peer transfer method. None.
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:54:10
This is NOT a new idea. Basically everyone who understands bitcoin knows that a full node is only useful if you actually use it. If you are just relaying transactions you are just wasting resources. Here is an old discussion of this by Peter Wuille and others.

@_date: 2019-08-19 00:12:11
I think you’re way over dramatizing. The fix right now is to use a passphrase. There is no hardware solution that doesn’t involve the use of a secure-element which by definition is closed source. In that case you would not even know if the manufacturer is forced to put in backdoors by govt. so the answer is not that simple. You would be a fool to use a Ledger without a passphrase since you will never know of any hardware backdoors so you have to assume they’re there. 
Having a Trezor Model One right now allows you to create a secure wallet seed and to send transactions securely even on a computer infected with malware. Don’t tell me all that is ‘worthless’. And if you add a passphrase you’re protected against this physical extraction attack also.
@_date: 2019-08-18 17:19:49
You’re correct but you have to remember that the $100 exploit was just announced a couple of months ago—it’s not something that’s been apparent for years. Also the only ones that can really do it are Ledger Labs—as far as anyone knows. So it’s not like anyone with $100 can just extract the seed from a Trezor.

@_date: 2016-12-02 22:39:27
You are correct in what you are stating. The problem is NOT with IRS policy, it is with Coinbase policy and how they chose to characterize transactions that involved simple bitcoin transfers as a sale. They did NOT have to internally record those transfers as sales. 
Coinbase tells you that it's up to you to report bitcoin transfers as you see fit and they would be correct on that point EXCEPT in the case of the audit that is occurring now. The IRS will get data from Coinbase that shows any transfer of bitcoin that was made by their customers as a sale. Thus, if someone transferred a large amount of bitcoins to a private wallet, the IRS won't know that it was just an asset transfer. They will think it was a sale (as per Coinbase records).
At that point, the IRS may check to see if that particular user reported any capital gains or losses from such a 'sale'. If not, they will want to know why. Of course, you can now go through a long explanation to the IRS about why this was just a transfer and not a sale, but it WILL cost you a lot of time, trouble, and MONEY !! 
So, you are right, Coinbase is ABSOLUTELY creating a TON of extra work for it's users. If Coinbase had only recorded actual sales as sales, then this nightmare scenario involving simple bitcoin transfers could be avoided.
This issue was discussed here before when it was made clear that Coinbase was giving users 1099 statements even in cases that bitcoin transfer were being made. Only a few people seemed to understand at the time what a horrible policy this was. So, yes, Coinbase is DELIBERATELY creating needless headaches for it's customers. 
@_date: 2018-06-04 02:18:05
This is really the right answer. Almost all the ‘other’ coins are all centralized ‘blockchains’ which is an oxymoron. A blockchain at heart is a very inefficient database. It’s sole defining quality is that it’s decentralized.  What’s the point of a centralized blockchain? 
All those other coins have a lot of hype—see EOS now. At one point bitconnect and Onecoin had a ton of hype too. 
@_date: 2016-11-02 22:05:58
Also, doesn't Coinbase file 1099 statements for every sale you make? This is a horrible thing to do for users. So if you sell 1 bitcoin for $730, coinbase will file a 1099 for $730--now the IRS thinks you 'earned' $730 from this transaction. But what if you bought the bitcoin for $700? Instead of you reporting the $30 gain to the IRS, Coinbase has gone ahead and reported a $730 gain for you !! This is just horrible !!
@_date: 2018-06-23 13:48:36
You were just lucky in your timing--you bought at $227 on the way UP. You keep forgetting there were many who bought at $227 and who finally sold at $160 or so. It was a brutal correction. 
Bitcoin is still in the speculative phase--it hasn't even gotten to the useful payments phase yet. As such there are 2 types of people buying bitcoin--traders who are just speculating on price. I would guess this group comprises maybe 90% of the people. There there are true believers--people who bought it previously at $10, $100, $300, $1200, $300 (again), $3000, and continue buying even today.
@_date: 2019-08-23 15:25:39
For your information, the easiest way of converting BTC to cash (whatever cash you want) is to go on localbitcoins.com and find someone reputable there who will buy the bitcoin from you and give you cash. Some are even able to transfer local currency into your bank account. Always start small first so you learn the process.
@_date: 2018-06-04 16:53:49
Yeah...I agree. In all honesty, I cannot for the life of me think of a true innovative use of a real, decentralized blockchain other than for 'digital money'. All other uses that most people talk about can just be done by a trusted database much more cheaply and efficiently.
Of course, I could be wrong and I am prepared to be surprised by new innovative uses, but I can't think of any that would justify the costs of a true, decentralized blockchain. That's why I am confused about any 'value' attributed to most of these ICO tokens--they are just centrally controlled tokens pretending they are based on 'decentralized blockchain technology'. Whatever. 
@_date: 2016-11-02 22:00:23
I think it would help if you gave users a simple choice--"Do you want to send this transaction as a priority?" and then add whatever fee is needed to get into the next block. Or maybe a box to check that says Priority Tx. The default would be to have the box unchecked. That would help with REALLY IMPORTANT transactions where someone wouldn't mind paying a higher fee to get into the next block.

@_date: 2016-12-03 18:14:22
I think you have it wrong. I don't really think the majority of people 'selling' bitcoins do it so that buyers can 'invest' in them. For the majority of people, bitcoins are purchased so they can use them--for example, to buy things over the internet from international vendors--maybe even from other individuals for whom processing credit cards is more trouble than it's worth. 
If your main criticism of bitcoin is that it should not be sold as an 'investment' then that's fine--but you can say that about many other 'investments' which people are sold--including gold, silver, diamonds, and a TON of stocks that are pure garbage. There is nothing unique about criticizing bitcoin as an investment. 
However, I get the impression that you criticize the very IDEA of cryptocurrency--not that it shouldn't be an investment. This belief of yours then just shows lack of understanding of what cryptocurrencies are as a new paradigm that has a truly useful function that is distinct from the national fiat currencies.

Technically Ripple is not a ‘coin’ at all. Everything they’re trying to do they can do using a database and a centralized token. It only became a ‘coin’ as a way to scam money from idiots by using words like ‘blockchain’ technology. So, in fact, I would call it a scam.

Do you really believe that? Do you know of a TON of people that are 'borrowing' on their crypto at 12%. That's INSANE when interest rates are below 4%. Most likely they are paying you 'interest' from their investors' money. 
But what are they doing with your bitcoin? My guess is using them to do risky trades--like lending them out for short selling. I think that's where those massive sell orders of thousands of bitcoins being sold simultaneously at all exchanges around the world are coming from. But that won't get them a 'safe' 6% interest rate. And what happens when the trades go bad? 
I think the whole thing is a big disaster waiting to happen. Same principle as always applies--if it sounds too good to be true....

TLDR - the author wrote a book about cypherpunks and the use of 'cryptographic money'. This talk was in Sept. 2008 so one month before Satoshi released the White Paper. The guy was asking the author about why he thought the idea of 'crypto money' had died and why no one cared working on that any more. How ironic.

This will happen FOR SURE when merchants/sellers decide they want bitcoin for whatever reason. The easiest way of acquiring bitcoin is to offer to accept it for goods and services. I know many merchants accept it now but today it’s not REAL acceptance since the vast majority just sell the bitcoin for cash immediately. In the future they will choose to start to hold some bitcoin. Then their suppliers will also start to accept bitcoin for the same reasons and at that point you will have the beginnings of a true bitcoin economy developing—ie. where you as a merchant accept bitcoin and you also pay some of your suppliers with it.

It's not a bug. It's part of the fact that it uses open-source hardware. It was always known you could extract the seed from the hardware device--for example, using an electron microscope. This is why the BIP44 protocol includes the use of a passphrase.
The new development now is that the folks at Ledger Labs can extract the seed from a Trezor without the need of super expensive equipment like electron-microscopes. 
Regardless, if you need to guard against physical attacks on the device, I don't think you can assume that ANY device (Trezor, Ledger, or whatever) is safe from someone using an electron microscope to read the seed words off it. In this case, you should always use a passphrase.

Bitpay abandoned the bitcoin community a long time ago--most significantly when they implied to merchants running their 'bitcore' server software that they needed to 'upgrade' their software to one enforcing Segwit2X in order to 'continue using bitcoin' which was a BLATANT lie.

It will be interesting to see what happens as the SegWit activation period approaches 1 year.
@_date: 2016-12-06 15:56:49
Actually, if Segwit doesn't reach 95% then it shouldn't be activated. It's ok. That's how it's supposed to work. You don't want a fork activating that has significant resistance. 
The worst thing is to have a fork-a-week because of ....(improvements or add other excuses). At that point, it won't be long in a few years that you will have a TON of people wanting to fork to increase the coin supply because of .....fill in a TON of 'valid-sounding' reasons. 
Then, the currency will be dead. However, if you can get 95% of people to agree to a fork that increases the supply, well, then that would be different. I think 95% is a good threshhold to have.

I'll try to help you:
1. No you don't have to update. The main features of the update affect BCH, Zcash, and NEM.
2. No. The bug is in firmware 1.6.1 so most likely any update from 1.6.1 will wipe the device.
3. Don't do this. You are just asking for MASSIVE problems. Once you send the BTC to Coinbase they are no longer YOUR bitcoin. They are Coinbase's bitcoins and they may not let you withdraw them so easily without you doing a TON of KYC/MLM paperwork.
4. No. Once you wipe your Trezor you will have to setup your PIN once again.
5. No. You can test your seed right now at the Trezor wallet site. If it tells you the seed is good, then it is good. 
Summary: No need to update at all. If you ever want to update safely, the best thing to do is just get a second Trezor. Then you can update that one and 'recover' your seed words to the new one. If everything works, you can wipe and update your old one. Or you can keep both Trezors which control the same bitcoins. 
@_date: 2016-12-08 23:18:21
These are all good points--and very critical points. However, I feel that these problems are a predictable result of the main design of bitcoin--ie. creating a decentralized system that cannot be easily shut down. It would be so much 'easier' to fix the issue of fees and scaling if we could just centralize the 'processing' of transactions. Of course, that makes the few 'central processors' vulnerable to government threats. 
So, we opt for a decentralized system and, of course, it's not 'easy' to scale such a system. I think it's possible but it will be slow. I believe SegWit will be an important step toward that goal--but not the end goal. Basically, I see bitcoin remaining in 'beta' stage for at least 3-4 more years.

This guy is giving you good advice. In no scenario is using the Gemini app acceptable for trading. Even if you become are destined to become an expert trader, you would not trade on the Gemini app--it's just not designed for that.

It’s a scam because the company gives the impression that higher demand for it will lead to an increase in price. In reality the supply controlled by the company is essentially unlimited but very few people understand this. The company likes to keep it that way. The only justifiable use for Ripple as an interbank transfer token is as a stable coin. There is no reason in the world for its value to fluctuate and it only does so because of manipulation by the company. 
Talking about Ripple now reminds me of discussions regarding Bitconnect. It was such a clear scam—except for the thousands of promoters it had. People forget Bitconnect once reached  in the CoinMarketCap top 10. It doesn’t matter how big you are and how many people you fool. A scam will always be a scam.

You are correct when talking about religion. Just because you haven't SEEN Jesus walk on water or make the blind see again doesn't mean he DIDN'T do it !! That's called faith. 
But, we are NOT talking about religion here. We are talking about ECDSA and bitcoin addresses and private keys. You either have them or you don't. It's NOT ABOUT FAITH !! So, yes, if someone says they are Satoshi and they 'lost' the keys then as far as anyone who believes is math is concerned that person IS NOT SATOSHI. Period. This belief is further strengthened by the fact that anyone who listened to Satoshi carefully would tell he would NEVER misplace those keys. If Satoshi is still alive, he certainly has those keys.

Bottom line: It’s not a currency. It’s money. There’s a difference. You can spend money when you need something. But money is really meant to store value across time. The idea is you work when you’re young so you don’t have to when you’re old. What are you going to spend when you’re old? The money (not the currency) you saved when you were young. 
Think of it like this. USD is currency and gold is money. When you’re young you work and get paid in USD currency. You use some for your expenses and you buy gold with currency to save for your future. 30 years later you now have gold you can convert to currency again to spend as needed. You definitely would not have wanted to save USD currency 30 years ago since it would be almost worthless in terms of what you could buy with it. Bitcoin is like gold—but digital.

Well blockchains are EXTREMELY inefficient. There is NO WAY that a distributed blockchain can ever become as efficient as a centralized system like VISA or Paypal. Of course, the biggest advantage of a blockchain is that it's a decentralized trustless system that is difficult to shut down. If Lightning Network can provide those advantages while improving the efficiency then it sounds like a truly great idea.

Well to be fair at that time it wasn’t so obvious. There’s been a lot of analysis done now related to cycles and stock to flow ratios that no one really discussed. If it was so obvious everyone would have bought. When Tim Draper bought the first batch of Silk Road bitcoins for $650 each everyone laughed at him. The price then dropped to a low of $150. The last batch of Silk Road coins sold for an average of $225 each and even Draper didn’t bid. In fact there were no big ‘serious’ bidders. That batch was won by a scam cloud mining company. Even Barry Silbert didn’t bid on that batch. So again, what seems obvious now wasn’t then.

Bitcoin is a new type of hard money and we haven’t witnessed the early stages of adoption of this for thousands of years. If you could go back in time to when gold was starting to be used as money you would have witnessed its value jump over 1000X in 10 years when compared against whatever was being used as money. The massive price increase would have been a sign of people recognizing that they better convert whatever they used as money to gold because gold was quickly being established as the only thing other people would accept as money. The same process is happening today—people are willing to trade more of whatever they use as money for bitcoin. Bitcoin is not changing in value—other types of money are devaluing against it.

Unfortunately nothing electronic like Paypal. The reason is that Paypal transactions are easily reversible while bitcoin transfers are not. So if someone sends you $ in Paypal and then you send them bitcoins, they just tell Paypal their account was 'hacked'. The $ is then withdrawn from your Paypal account by Paypal and put back in their account--but they keep your bitcoins. It's a very old scam.
Last time Paypal was viable for bitcoin trading was in 2012 or so. After the price of bitcoin rose past $30, people began scamming on Paypal.

You have a good point, but cryptocurrency doesn't work like that. There are many 'coins' right now that have 'better' features than bitcoin--I will just point at the 'fast' confirmation times of Litecoin. But, it's not comparable to Bitcoin. Look at what's happening in ETH. Features are not more important than trust. 
If a 'better' coin came along, then maybe miners will migrate to that and then bitcoin difficulty will drop and then changes like Segwit can pass with the miners that are left. Then there might be a migration back. I don't know the future. 
However, I do know that making it 'easy' to hard fork a coin is by DEFINITION is it's doom. It shouldn't be 'easy' to alter the economic fundamentals.
PS. I have a feeling SegWit WILL activate. It just won't be quickly. And that's OK.

Nahh. I can tell you what will happen so you won’t be disappointed. BTC will rise to about $55k and then it will start dropping...$50k, $45k,$40k, $35k,$30k, $25k—and THAT’s when you’ll panic sell !! Then it will rise again and drop again and you’ll sell again. By the time it gets to $100k you won’t have any BTC to sell. 
HODLing is NOT easy if you measure the  ‘value’ of your BTC in USD. If you begin to recognize that the value of BTC is in having BTC (as opposed to holding USD) then these price swings won’t affect you much and you will still have your BTC when it’s $250k or more !!!

But as you know secure-elements are closed-source and as cryptocurrency gains wider adoption you would have to be a fool to not assume that the manufacturers of such chips won’t be forced to put in backdoors by governments. In this you (Ledger Inc.) as the buyer of the chips would not even have to know about it.

The Nano S supports more coins than Trezor. But most of those are crap coins—Except to those who own them (I guess). I don’t know if any hard data that says it’s more popular than Trezor but it is cheaper and it does have a lot of users. The Trezor UI is much simpler for beginners though.

Did you send BTC to the hotel directly or was it to some service like Bitpay? Was the checkin desk person familiar with how to accept BTC payments it did they have to call in someone else to deal with BTC?
@_date: 2018-06-26 18:50:53
No it's not. It's terribly out of date. First of all it uses it's own word list derivation path so if the Bread app disappears, you cannot get your funds back by using the word list on a different wallet app. For example, you can't recover your funds to Electrum or to a Trezor. 
Second, it is NOT segwit compatible so you will be overpaying in fees when you send transactions.
They really need to move to using a BIP39 compatible derivation path and they need to upgrade to Segwit. Right now, I think that 'bitwallet' for the iphone is a better bitcoin wallet.

It's not bad advice to say that you can SAFELY RECEIVE to the same address multiple times. If you think that's unsafe then you don't understand the bitcoin protocol. 
The simplest reason for doing this is a HOLDler. You use a hardware wallet and you create a receive address. Then you can store your hardware wallet in a vault or safe. From then on whenever you purchase BTC you can SAFELY send them to the same receive address you created previously and there is no need to go dig up your hardware wallet and create a new receive address. In fact, it compromises your physical security to keep accessing your hardware wallet.
Notice I said receive only--ie. you are not spending multiple times from the same address.

Exposing the XPub would not compromise your bitcoins. How did you setup the Trezor initially? Did the site ask you to type in the seed words to 'confirm' them? Where did you store your seed words when you first setup the Trezor?

I don't agree. Look at all the surveys using REAL people. The vast majority of people have not even heard of bitcoin. Just this past week someone posted here who was traveling in Europe and staying at a hostel--most guests were in their 20's. Almost none had even heard of bitcoin. 
Do your own experiment and ask people you know who are not tech savvy. You will be shocked. I think we are still way too early. The real fight begins when old world financial institutions feel threatened and this won't happen until they get some of their OLDER customers shifting funds away from them and telling them it's because they want to buy bitcoin.

Ok...you are correct about UTXOs, but can you please answer the technical question there is confusion about. My impression is that when UTXO's are received they are bound to the actual receiving address--that's what the system keeps track of. But brando2123 says the system actually keeps track of the transaction ID that sent the UTXO. I don't think this is correct. I think the system keeps track of the UTXOs attached to an ADDRESS. 
So, which is correct?

Like I said before a **few** people were saying the halvening will impact prices but **most** people (me included) did not believe that. But enough of the past, let’s talk about the present. The stock to flow models are predicting BTC prices over $50k about 1 year after the halvening. Am I using every single penny I have to buy BTC at $8k? I am **not**. Why? Because I am stupid? Maybe. But really it’s because I think BTC is ‘expensive’at $8k. Same reason as during the last halvening where I thought it was expensive at $600. So if BTC does rise to over $50k in 2021 then I am definitely stupid for making the same mistake twice.
@_date: 2019-10-04 17:00:25
Dude you really need to understand more about the actual bitcoin protocol and how cryptography works. I don't want to continue with this ridiculous argument since you obviously don't understand the basics. You have a little bit of knowledge and it makes you paranoid. 
It's true that when you spend from an address you reveal your public key. However, this is hardly 'dangerous'. If you think that by revealing your public key once it means that your private key can be compromised then bitcoin is finished and so is asymmetric cryptography. 
Now I will grant you that it is NOT a good practice to spend and receive all from one address but in the early days people did this for THOUSANDS of spends--and yet it didn't allow anyone to calculate the private key of those addresses. I just showed you one huge address (the Bitfinex cold wallet) that has over 50,000 bitcoins in it as of RIGHT NOW. That address has been receiving and spending from that same address for OVER 5 YEARS. If it's so dangerous then go ahead and steal those bitcoins.

I think that’s what that loser Wright did in his last fake proof—he showed a hash without showing the actual signature. 
@_date: 2019-06-18 05:31:03
This summary is pure BS created by Wright. There is ZERO evidence Craig or Kleiman had anything to do with the creation of bitcoin. Craig scammed the Australian govt and was caught in 2014. He was a loser who lost $ trading a small # of bitcoins at Mt. Gox. He came up with the idea he was Satoshi when he was being questioned by the Australian govt about what he did with the fraudulent funds he received from them for building a supercomputer—which he never built. So he said he did build it and used it to mine bitcoins but he can’t give them the bitcoins or show them the computer because they’re locked in a secret Trust. 
Then he fled to London after his house in Australia was raided by the tax office and he then convinced that other idiot Ayre to pay off the $ he cheated out of the Australian govt in exchange for his ‘intellectual’ property regarding bitcoin. This really is the correct summary. Craig has ZERO bitcoins other than what he and Ayre may be mining. Kleiman had NOTHING to do with bitcoin. Likely died without hearing about it.

Here is the bottom line--there isn't any 'legitimate' way of doing that. There are however, a ton of scams, all of which involve you 'depositing' your bitcoins with someone else. Some claim they 'trade' them and earn income. Others claim they will 'lend' them to traders and pay you income from the interest they charge.
They may even pay you something small initially. But, at the end of the day, one way or another, you will find it very difficult to get your coins back. 
Think of it this way, there are a TON of bitcoins just sitting in many addresses that have not moved for years. If there was a proven way to 'generate income' those people would do that too.

Bitcoin doesn’t compete with other cryptos or with visa/Mc or with the future Facebook coin or JP Morgan coin or Bank of America coin or whatever else may come. With all the new, fancy cryptos that are created by a ‘foundation’ or company and all the upcoming ‘official’ government coins you will not have sovereign control over your wealth. If you hold any of them there still a third party has has control over your finances. Only bitcoin gives you true monetary freedom—nothing else comes even close. 
It’s not that bitcoin will magically solve wars and corruption. It’s whether sovereign money that cannot be inflated away by corrupt governments will help to do that. 
Like I said before, if you think bitcoin is about the ‘technology’ then you really don’t get the big picture. Good luck to you.

Absolutely. Antpool and BTC.com are the same company. I bet 'unknown' is also Bitmain. There is no way that anyone that's 'unknown' can come up with that much hash power so quickly.

No you don't. You need a bad payment site. That's why it's such a big deal. The tweet didn't explain it well enough. Let's say you have 10 BTC in your Ledger wallet. You want to purchase something online that was REALLY cheap. Let's say it's a top gaming laptop for 0.1 BTC. So you go to this site and you use your Ledger to pay. The site presents you an invoice for 0.1 BTC going to their address. So, obviously you agree. Ledger asks you to confirm this on the device and you do.
What happens next is that the Ledger then sends 0.1 BTC to that site (as expected). BUT, if the site had been hacked and was maliciously coded, the Ledger then sends the rest of your 'change' (9.9 BTC) to a hacker's address. Your Ledger is left EMPTY !!!
That's a SUPER SERIOUS BUG !!!

You know the answer to this. Either someone was given a real Sephora $250 gift card that they want to trade for cash (in this case bitcoin) and they are willing to sell it to you for $166. 
Or someone has stolen credit card  and they buy a card from Sephora (or any store you want) using the info. Sephora charges $250 for the gift card to the account of the stolen credit card. The thief gets $166 in BTC from you. 
If you go and use the card right away it might even work—for a while. But eventually it will be reported as fraud. If you use the card online from your own account, your account will be labeled as fraudulent. Does Purse care—not really. They get fees in bitcoin from the seller.

It's not meant to be FUD. Bitman had about 48% of hash power previously when ViaBTC and BTC.top had a significantly larger share of hash power. Now the hash power of those 2 entities has decreased dramatically and all of a sudden 'unknown' pool has increased massively by about the same percentages.  
You tell me if it's more likely that hashpower was shifted from ViaBTC and BTC.top on purpose to 'hide' their hash power or if some truly 'unknown' entity just appeared out of nowhere with massive hashpower. I hope that 'unknown' is not controlled by Bitmain, but I think it's more likely than not.

Shouldn't Bitfinex be the one to provide evidence that it is solvent. After all, it's a fact that they lost their banking in March 2017--both Bitfinex and Tether and yet they keep creating millions of new Tethers that go straight into Bitfinex. 
Also, they explicitly lied when they said they had engaged Ledger Labs to do a security audit and a financial audit--only to admit later they Ledger labs never did anything for them. These kinds of actions don't generate a lot of confidence. I don't think Bitfinex ever even formally reported the theft to any law enforcement agency.

He only sold ‘high’ in retrospect. Selling at $14k when it had come down from $19k was not necessarily selling ‘high’. Only if you knew it would still go down. Many people thought they sold ‘high’ in Sept 2017 when they sold at $2800 after it came down from $4k or so. Also a TON of people sold ‘high’ at $1,250–see that idiot Vinny Lingham who boasted about how smart he was for selling all his BTC at that price. He looked like a genius after BTC dropped to $800—but just for a while. 
My point is that these things are not easy to see at the time. If he buys now and later we find out this is the low, then he would have bought ‘low’. If he buys now and the price drops to $1,000 then he would have still bought ‘high’. You just don’t know at the time—only in retrospect.

Actually from everything I have read here, Coinbase (and Circle) is MUCH WORSE than any bank that I have ever dealt with. I don't know of any bank that demands to know exactly what you are going to do with the money you withdraw from it and then closes your account if it doesn't like the answer you give. If Coinbase and Circle are the future of bitcoin, then the battle is already lost because I would rather deal with regular banks than deal with those two companies.

See the problem here might be one of perspective. Believe it or not I read the EXACT same sentiments you are stating in Nov.-Dec. 2013 when the price rose past $1,200. Look at the price now. What I am basically saying is that these markets are so irrational that you can't ever really know when the 'top' might be.
I don't see anything wrong with any of your arguments, but I can see someone else making those EXACT arguments when the price is $50,000 and warning people that it's too high. That's the rub--what is 'too high' depends on your perspective. To the guy that bought a ton of bitcoins at $1 then $30 bitcoin was a massive top. 
I have saved your post and will reference back to it in about 1 year. You could be right. We will see.

Dude, this is not some top secret conspiracy. Google 'Bitfinex Wells Fargo Lawsuit'. Wells Fargo cut them off in March 2017 and Bitfinex filed a lawsuit against them. All their information is in the lawsuit. Bitfinex then dropped the lawsuit. After they dropped it, all the Taiwan banks cut them off. 
As of right now there is no way to send any kind of wire transfer INTO Bitfinex or Tether--to ANY bank anywhere in the world. NONE. So, how are they receiving all these hundreds of millions of USD that they claim they received when they created hundreds of millions of Tethers over the past few months? That's the key question people are asking. That's all.

Not just because of this bug, but in general I think it's better not to use your main 'savings' for routine purchases. 
So the two options I see would be to have one main hardware wallet for 'savings' and then periodically transfer small amounts to something like BRD wallet (on iPhone/Android) to then use for spending. Alternatively you can have a second hardware wallet that can be for used for spending. This last option is where I see something like the Ledger X with Bluetooth filling a niche since you can use it with an iPhone.

The message is clearly fake. Satoshi is very smart--you can see it in his writings from bitcointalk.org. It's obvious that whoever wrote that email is an idiot with barely a high-school education. As a simple example, Satoshi would never start off by using the phrase 'pretender-Bitcoin'. Instead he would explain why he would be opposed to the new fork in a rational manner. Only a fool starts off a discussion with the conclusion. Case closed.
@_date: 2017-11-20 06:19:18
They are not going to come up with any actual facts because the facts are that neither Bitfinex nor Tether have bank accounts and the Tethers are created out of thin air. Those are facts. The statement they put out is just empty words. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:21:31
It’s not FUD. They claim to have the USD to back all the Tethers. Just this month they created over $100 million Tethers. Both Bitfinex  and Tether lost their bank accounts in March 2017. Explain to me how they got $100 million given to them without any bank accounts. It could be that this occurred but they are the ones that need to explain how.

Nope. Any failure of Bitfinex will affect ALL CRYPTOCURRENCIES--litecoin, ethereum, bitcoin, bch. You name it.

This reminds me of an old discussion I saw at a financial forum. Paul Krugman was one of the guests and someone brought up bitcoin as being a digital currency. He chuckled and said that bitcoin is useless and that we have 'digital money' now. He said that you can walk into any bank and have your money sent 'digitally' anywhere in the world. The other panelists then laughed too.
I would have loved to be there and ask them if USD is truly 'digital' then can I walk into my bank with a USB thumb drive and tell them I want to withdraw my 'digital' USD to this USB drive so I can store it myself at home?
@_date: 2019-06-10 22:09:00
It would compromise all the addresses on the same account as the one with the private key you derived. But to be safe you should move EVERYTHING away from that wallet. 
Right now most people used seed words to claim forks. A common mistake that many people made during the crazy fork time of 2017 was that they moved away all their bitcoin and then entered the actual seed words into a fork site to claim the bitcoin fork coins. HOWEVER, they forgot to move their ETH, LTC, etc. and ALL their cryptos were stolen.
So, bottom line is if you must reveal a bitcoin private key then you need to completely move away ALL COINS that are attached to a master private key--or a seed. 
I think this is a surprise to you because you must be new. There were many warnings about this during the crazy fork days. But it's great you asked the question first prior to actually doing it.
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:21:01
Was your 2fa with Google Athenticator instead of text message? If it was Google then it's unlikely your account was hacked. 
That really only leaves the possibility of your seed being compromised. Blockchain.info had an episode a few years back where the site was making bitcoin addresses with a weak random number generator and their private keys could be easily calculated by anyone and thus the bitcoins were being swept up. But, I doubt this problem occurred again.
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:49:24
Are you from Bitfinex? If what you are saying is true, then that's great news. I really don't want to see Bitfinex implode like Mt. Gox since it would hurt ALL cryptocurrencies. 
You guys can help to calm this whole situation by releasing a proper audit. I hope you can see why people are concerned since the supply of Tethers has increased so dramatically in just the past 2 months. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 23:09:27
I wouldn't say zero evidence. The fact is that neither Tether nor Bitfinex have had any USD bank accounts since they lost them in April 2017. 
So, how are people giving them $600 USD to create Tethers with? That's the key question. The answer is that they are not. If there is anything to prove, it should be Bitfinex providing a valid audit, which they have NOT done. As far as I am concerned there is real, valid concern here.
@_date: 2019-06-10 22:29:54
Yeah. Be careful with exposing any private key unless you really know what you’re doing. Ask questions first. Many people didn’t claim certain shit forks (eg. Bitcoin Private) because it would be too much work to move all their cold storage coins to a whole new wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:19:29
Don't you have it backwards? You don't think Bitfinex should provide evidence that the millions of Tethers they created are actually backed by USD--especially since both Bitfinex and Tethers have no bank accounts. 
Also, the Tethers issue is not limited to bitcoin. A failure of Bitfinex will impact ALL CRYPTOCURRENCIES.

It's in the interest of Blockchain.com to set high transaction fees for bitcoin. Blockchain.com/info is really a BCH company so they want to show how bitcoin has 'high' fees. Same goes with Bitpay. Don't use either of those companies.
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:26:09
Someone else reported something similar. Any chance your seed was somehow compromised--eg. did you store it online or send it by email?
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:21:08
Wow....this is indeed very strange. Especially since your second transfer for 0.1btc did not get swept. The only way I can think that this happened is if someone else had your private key (your seed words). If the private key is compromised, they can sweep the bitcoins without the need to even login to your blockchain.info account so having 2fa wouldn't make a difference. 
Did you ever store the seed online somehow or could your seed have been compromised by someone else who had access to it? I know blockchain used to give an option to email the seed to yourself? Was your seed ever sent by email?
Can you post a transaction ID so we can look at the exact timestamps of the transactions?

FTFY - This guy mines.  :)
@_date: 2019-02-20 22:23:41
You might be right...but assume this. Someone has a BRD wallet and their seed is safely stored. Then they either lose their phone or can't access their phone. So, now they try to 'recover' their wallet using many other wallets that are available that also use seed words. I guarantee you that over 90% of people who use BRD and have their seed words saved as a backup probably believe they can use those seed words to restore their wallet on a Trezor or some other wallet. But that is just not the case. 
ALL those other wallets use BIP39/BIP44 (except BRD), so they enter their seed words from BRD (eg. on a Trezor or Greenwallet etc) and they see an account with zero balance. Now they panic. Maybe for hours. Maybe in desperation they ask for help and some scammer tells them that they need their seed words and maybe they give them thinking that they lost their bitcoins anyways. In fact, what has occurred is that the wrong derivation was used. But this person doesn't know that. 
So, again, if you just make it clear to people that if they lose their phone they can only use their BRD seed words on another BRD wallet, it would save a lot of anxiety. 
In the wallet instructions, prior to having people write down their seed words just make it explicit that BRD seed words only work on BRD wallet. That's all I am asking.

Interesting theory? More like stupid theory ! Really this guy’s whole thought process is based on comparing what happened in 2014-16 to now? If only life (and markets) were so simple. 
The bitcoin of today is NOTHING like the bitcoin of 2015. It’s like comparing Apple today to the Apple  of the 1990’s. Of course bitcoin can go lower than $3,000–but it can also go much higher. Looking at 2014-16 data isn’t going to give any insight about future bitcoin prices.

It's not bullshit. There are very real concerns regarding Bitfinex and Tethers. When banking was suspended for Bitfinex and Tether, Bitfinex said they did not expect the supply of Tethers to increase until banking could be re-established. Banking has not been re-established and yet they have created over $500 million of new Tethers. Printed out of thin air--just like that.
In fact, you can predict EXACTLY when they will be created--the minute the price of bitcoin starts to drop. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 07:52:36
Ok dude. Just put your head in the sand. That's fine. A report of a $30 million hack of Tether caused a 6% drop in the price of bitcoin and a lot of other cryptocurrencies.
The allegations are that hundreds of millions of Tethers are also similarly nonredeemable because they are not backed by anything. But, yeah, that's not a problem at all. It won't affect anything. Sure.

Actually I know for a fact that you CANNOT import the BRD seed into Trezor. So basically you are saying there is no other wallet that supports the BRD seed standard and there is no way to import your actual seed into another wallet. I think you guys need to make that very clear to customers. 
In fact, a better option would be for you to make standard BIP44 seeds so that they can be imported into a Trezor or Ledger.

It has everything to do with it. Tethers ONLY get created when the price of bitcoin is dropping and they are ALL sent to Bitfinex. If they are being used in leveraged margin positions then you can say that $600 million of Tethers is being amplified 3X or even 10X through margin lending.

Regardless, all I am saying is that it's never obvious at the time what the right call is. It's only ever right in retrospect. 
Look at what all the 'experts' are saying now--almost all of them are STILL calling for sub $2,000 BTC. Who's right? I don't know. 
Thus, the best strategy is just to buy a small amount every week. But of course that's not as sexy as writing that you sold all at some magical high number or that you bought all at some 'bottom' number.
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:25:36
I know you are new, so I will try to keep this simple. Your bitcoins were not stored at blockchain.info--they were stored on the bitcoin blockchain on thousands of computers around the world. Don't confuse the name of the company 'Blockchain.info' with the actual bitcoin blockchain. Blockchain.info was just an interface for you to interact with the bitcoin blockchain. When you setup an account at Blockchain.info they gave you some seed words to write down. By write down they mean literally write it down--don't ever type it into a computer. Those seed words are your private key and anyone who has those words can transfer your bitcoins--without even having to access your computer or even your blockchain.info account.
So, if you leave those seed words laying around or if you showed them to anyone else, they could take your bitcoins. Are you sure you never entered those seed words into any computer or show them to anyone? A compromised seed is the only way I can think of that your bitcoins were stolen.

Many wallets use BIP39---but they also use the BIP44 standard. Trezor uses BIP39 and BIP44. Greenaddress is the same and thus it is NOT compatible with BRD because BRD is NOT BIP44 compliant. So, again there are no other wallets compatible with your seed.
The idea of being able to import a seed is as a backup plan in case BRD were to completely disappear. I think it's important that you guys warn potential users that your wallet seed is unique to BRD and is not compatible with any other wallet out there. I guarantee you that a bunch of users see '12 word seed' and immediately think it is just like the Trezor seed--which it is NOT.
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:21:42
It's not FUD. 
What motivated this post is sadness. There was a guy on bitcointalk that looked like he was in his 60's. He posted something along the lines of 'I wish I had never heard about Bitcoin. It ruined my life'. The post was in the fall of 2014 and it described how he had gotten very excited about bitcoin and the technology behind it the previous year and he 'invested' a significant amount of his savings in it. I believe he bought at an average price of around $850. 
At the time he posted the price was below $400 and he was clearly desperate. He talked about how he won't be able to retire and how his life was now ruined. Most everyone in the forum advised him to sell immediately because, of course, everyone KNEW that bitcoin was going below $100. I don't know what he did. 
The purpose of this post is to warn all the new people out there to be careful about the amount they are 'investing' in bitcoin. If you want to buy bitcoins, great. I am a strong believer in it. But don't buy with an amount of fiat that will significantly alter your life if it were to significantly decrease in value. 
That's all I am trying to say.
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:57:13
Yes...I know. And if people understand what they are buying then even buying bitcoin now at these prices will be fine. Afterall, the ones who bought it at $1,160 in 2013 are not complaining--if they still held it. 
I get worried seeing posts of people expecting a doubling of their 'investment' in a couple of months. That's a setup for disaster.
@_date: 2019-12-09 14:26:26
He really doesn't. A 'blockchain' is just a slow, inefficient database that doesn't scale. The only advantage it offers is decentralization and censorship-resistance. Those two qualities are important in bitcoin because it is money and you don't want a single entity in control of money (as we have now). Bitcoin is a true monetary revolution.
The other 'altcoins' are centralized blockchains controlled by a small groups of people. They are not censorship resistant and only offer a token so that it can be sold and traded and serve a means to enrich the few who controll those blockchains. Basically they are scams.

Tether implosion by itself won't have a big effect on the market. What will be huge is if Bitfinex itself were to go down suddenly--like BTCe did. Now THAT will definitely tank the price of bitcoin below $2,000.

The majority of their business now is selling legiti mate gift cards—but only for 5% discount. Not worth going through all that trouble for that. They also ‘ban’ sellers who engage in fraud—but they just re-register under a different username. 
Purse is funded by Roger Ver. At this point they exist just to promote Bitcoin Cash (BCH). The employees there are paid to do development work on Bitcoin Cash. They even have their own software implementation of Bitcoin Cash. 
I’m sure if you try to buy one of their legitimate gift cards with bitcoin they will show you a bunch of messages telling you how you should really use BCH since that’s the ‘real’ bitcoin.  Then they will tell you how horrible bitcoin is and how great BCH is. So Purse is basically a BCH development company whose main mission is to try to convince customers that BCH is bitcoin.

I heard it but you and Stephan have different audiences. I don’t think Stephan has many newbie or should I say altcoin enthusiasts as you have. Plus honestly Stephan has a much deeper understanding of bitcoin than you so his questions are not as basic as they should be. 
Maybe you can do it with another guest—why don’t you try to get Vijay or Murad to do a show on very basic bitcoin questions? I like the question you asked on Twitter, why are there two bitcoins on Coinbase? Of course the answer is that there is only one bitcoin and the other is a fake impostor but it needs to be explained in more detail so new people really understand. Twitter is not the right place for that discussion. Just a thought.

They should be afraid of Libra coin more since I’m sure it will have ‘zero’ fees—since the accepting merchant pays the fees. Tell me again why anyone would need a centrally controlled BCH with ‘low’ fees when we can have a bigger, better centrally controlled Facebook coin, JPMorgan coin, and many others that have ZERO fees and are ‘instant’ (super fast)?
Bitcoin is decentralized with NO COMPANY in control. That’s its value. Nothing else can compete with bitcoin. Nothing.

I would agree with you except it's the BIGGEST volume exchange in the world--by far. If the whole exchange were to go down it will affect a lot of people because many companies that deal in bitcoins have accounts there. So, it would affect even people who don't have an account there themselves.

I like Trezor best, but in all fairness they all use the passphrase feature. It's best implemented on the Ledger where no one will know you have a passphrase. In the Trezor you have to 'activate' the passphrase feature. After you use your passphrase account, you should then 'deactivate' the passphrase feature again or else it will prompt you for a passphrase so people will know you have a passphrase. 
In the Ledger this is not the case. You can enter your 'main' account and then go into the passphrase account--no need to tell the device ahead of time that you intend to use a passphrase.

Bitcoin will be the only one that is money. Others might survive if they find a real use case. That's going to be hard to do because once a real use-case is found, any centralized company will be able to come in and copy that business model and it will be more efficient and a lot more scaleable.

The idea is that the bitcoins you have in your account at an exchange are just a number in their books. It doesn’t mean anything.

Thanks for replying. Like I said before, I wish you guys well. I know that Bitfinex has been around for a long time and I hope you guys succeed. I have only read the articles concerning Tether that have appeared on my daily Medium feed. The main point they make is that Tethers appear to be created 'out of nothing' whenever the price of bitcoin is dropping. 
If there is actual USD being deposited into Tether and this results in the creation of Tethers then that's fine. There is no problem in that case.
Therefore, if you guys would just release a proper audit showing that there are real USD being deposited into Tether for every new Tether that is created then that would go a LONG way toward alleviating most people's concerns. 
@_date: 2019-04-10 00:36:54
Your thinking is logical but it is incorrect. In fact, what you are describing can happen in every other cryptocurrency--EXCEPT bitcoin. Miners don't control bitcoin. If miners deviate from the rules by giving themselves extra bitcoins (eg. increasing the block reward), the blocks they create will be rejected by the network as invalid. 
This is the key difference that separates bitcoin from all the other 'garbage' forks--especially bitcoin cash. In those chains the miners rule because regular users don't run full nodes. Not so in bitcoin and this is the key reason why running full nodes is so important.
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:53:31
Are you from Bitfinex? I hope you are correct and that is true--I really do. I don't want you guys to fail, but I hope you can see why people are concerned about the massive increase in the total number of Tethers in the past couple of months. I think you guys can do a lot to calm all this fear by just releasing a proper audit.
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:21:01
You will be waiting a LONG time. They won't give you any access to any bank accounts because they don't have any. But they don't want to say that, so they tell you to 'wait'. Of course, they will make an account for you at Bitfinex and when you sell bitcoins you will have 'USD'. However ,there will be no way for you to actually take possession of this USD. You will have to buy crypto to 'withdraw'--it's like a big circle.

The Trezor official firmware is signed with a private key that Trezor has. If you try to load official firmware onto a modified device the official firmware will warn you. It’s virtually impossible to do what you’re saying. The vulnerabilities have been in people getting access to your device and taking it apart—not in sending out a fake device. The other exploit is to ship out a device that already includes a wallet and a seed phrase that is ‘provided’ for you. 
If you buy a device and you load official firmware onto it yourself and you create your own wallet seed it’s basically 100% safe.

That's the point--they ARE NOT decentralized. They have just a veneer of decentralization. Look at what happened with Uniswap, a supposedly decentralized exchange, now banning users from certain countries. If they were truly decentralized this wouldn't occur.

Someone here posted an amazingly simple and detailed explanation of how versionbits signaling worked--down to the byte level explanation. It was great. During the whole Asicboost fiasco, someone posted a detailed breakdown of EXACTLY what's in the block header and how Asicboost exploited it and why it was exploitable.

I don’t agree. In this case, the only way BlockFi can afford to pay ‘interest’ on bitcoin is from the fees they get from lending the bitcoins to funds that want to use them to place huge sell orders to drive the market price down. Then they buy lower and pay the bitcoins back. 
However, this can’t go on forever. At some point the market will turn and all those sell orders will be bought up. Then how do the hedge funds pay them back? They have to borrow cash and buy them which will make it worse for them. If they can’t pay them back then BlockFi (and it’s customer’s) will be screwed. I don’t think people fully understand the risk they’re taking by ‘lending’ their bitcoins to BlockFi. There is no FDIC in bitcoin. Risk of coin loss is real. There is no ‘risk free’ interest payment in bitcoin.

The point is that running a pruned node makes it easier to run a node--and by doing that it's easier to USE the node.

Ok but that’s fantasy. That hardware needs software to run it. If you try to load the official firmware onto hardware with modified firmware it will warn you. Also if you are being targeted like that then the little seals on the official Trezor box won’t stop that. Even if you get it shipped from Trezor directly the hardware can be accessed.  So basically what you are describing can’t happen and if it could happen getting it from Trezor won’t make a difference if someone that sophisticated is targeting you.

I want segwit to activate, but I don't buy your statement at all. For a SAFE UASF you will need at least 75% of the hash--same threshhold BU wanted to use. In addition, you will need over 90-95% of the economically significant nodes to upgrade to it. That's not an easy goal to reach.

Each drawing is true for its own time frame. It’s not inconsistent to say that. Trying to use bitcoin for every single transaction would just make bitcoin another centralized shitcoin. No different from the hundred other shitcoins  out there except they can claim they’re ‘faster’. 
That’s not the point of the bitcoin revolution. Decentralized sound money is the point. Bitcoin can’t become that by staying with the 2010 philosophy of coffee payments on chain. However lightning is an incredible achievement that preserves the quality of bitcoin as sound money while allowing instant payments for coffee.

This is a key point. I don't have a problem with a block size increase (in the non-witness data) but I know that making it too large will lead to less individual nodes. 
I always understood the importance of running full nodes as the ultimate check on the bitcoin ecosystem by the users. That's why I was always uncomfortable when some people kept dismissing the importance of users running full nodes by saying that it's ok for nodes to be run out of large-scale 'data centers.'

As a true libertarian I see absolutely no difference between republicans and democrats. Both are corrupt. Any doubt was removed after I saw what republicans did in 2008. I’m sure Satoshi saw it too. In fact the bailouts are referenced in the genesis block. 
The republicans had their chance and they screwed up royally. So, let the socialists try. I already know how that plan is going to end. But they need to try themselves so good luck to them. I just want to be able to take my chips off the table and walk away. With bitcoin you can now do that.

@_date: 2017-04-23 16:39:02
They couldn't disagree more. Roger says all nodes that are not mining are useless. Luke is saying that to be really helpful a node should be used for more than just transmitting transactions and feeding the blockchain to other nodes--it needs to be used to actually verify that bitcoins you are receiving are valid. This makes the node an economic actor and not just a transaction transmitter. It makes it more helpful to the network because you're validating your transactions. Keep in mind that many miners don't even do validation.

This is the correct history. Satoshi did NOT like the fact that Wikileaks was promoting bitcoin and he said so. But he did NOT leave because of Wikileaks. He still continued to contribute on the message board after Wikileaks announced support for bitcoin. Actually, Satoshi's words were something like '[Wikileaks] has stirred the hornet's nest...and they [government] will be coming for us'.
He believed bitcoin was not ready for that kind of publicity at that time. 
Thanks for everything Satoshi--you are a GREAT man.

It's very dangerous to attempt any kind of UASF without a hashpower majority (at least 60% to account for variance). You forget that some miners, and 'leaders' like PeterR and Gavin, have already said that they are prepared to attack the minority chain. I know this is not a rational decision but look what's happening with Segwit on Litecoin. 
Humans can act irrationally for a lot longer than your theory predicts. Never underestimate the power of spitefulness.

This finding is HUGE....if true, then this should definitely improve chances of UASF. The main risk of UASF had been getting at least 51% miner support. Well, if the other miners don't see how they are basically being played for fools, then I don't know what will make them see that.

This would only happen if there were no human 'leaders'. The end result of ALL political systems is always control by the few people 'in charge'. 
The only way to avoid this is to either have no one in charge or make it so the ones 'in charge' have no real influence or power and are merely caretakers.

I completely agree. There is NO WAY that the proposed Classic hard fork is about the block size--it's about control. If it were about the block size, increasing to 2MB hardly makes any difference--they should go back to wanting a 20 MB increase. Once they (and Coinbase) are in control, I expect their version of 'Bitcoin' to be what Coinbase currently is--a government-subservient organization. They should just call it "CoinbaseCoin".

That's why it's 'covert'--not easy to prove. But, it's use is apparent if people are mining empty blocks. Also bitmain had it incorporated in its chips and its servers have the code to activate it. They have also been mining empty blocks while complaining about a full mempool. Yeah. Just coincidence.  
There's all the evidence that's being used but I should believe that they went through all that trouble to NOT use it. Because they say so. Right. 
@_date: 2017-04-06 01:45:39
Absolutely he will. But now everyone knows what's going on. There is no philosophical opposition to segwit for the 'good' of Bitcoin. It's all for his sleazy cheating in mining. 
@_date: 2019-04-04 07:00:30
Unfortunately YES. The only miners not supporting Segwit are controlled by Bitmain, which makes up a HUGE portion of the miners. 
Bitmain now controls Antpool (15% of mining power), BTC.com (21%), BTC.top (10%), and ViaBTC (5%)--so a total of about 51%. 
Why don't they support Segwit? Because Bitmain used to be able to CHEAT using a technique called ASICBOOST covertly. It allowed them to find blocks quicker and they used to mine a bunch of empty blocks--blocks with no transactions in them. Segwit prevented that. Notice that they now still use ASICboost but they have to do it overtly. 
Ironically enough it was Bitmain that was mainly responsible for the fork that split the bitcoin network and created Bitcoin Cash. On the positive side, it was really Bitmain selling all their bitcoin for bitcoin cash which crashed the price and has allowed people to buy sub $6,000 bitcoin. 
The sooner that Bitmain is completely destroyed, the better it will be for bitcoin.

It's the worst EVER. They are creating horrible problems for their customers. There is NO REASON in the world for them to file 1099 statements on the users who purchase Bitcoin from them. Bitcoin is supposed to be an asset--like gold. You can walk into any gold coin shop and buy gold coins and they will NOT file a 1099 on you. Hell if you pay cash, they don't even ask your name. If you buy bitcoins from Coinbase you are just creating headaches for yourself. They don't care about you--only about their own crazy definition of 'compliance'.

It's funny how you say real estate appreciates over time. I have properties I bought in 2002--before the big real estate bubble in the USA that I could not sell today for what I paid for them then. I could probably sell them for half--and that's without adding all the taxes I have paid. Yeah..go real estate.
I should mention I agree with you on one thing--I don't view bitcoin as an 'investment'. I never expected it to rise. I just hope that it holds its value. I have never told any friends or family members to purchase bitcoin. I only told a college-age niece to read up on it in order to understand the technology behind it. She ignored me and I have not brought it up again.
That's why I strongly disagree with those who want to turn bitcoin into a simple payment system. I am firmly in the digital gold camp and use a second layer for simple day-to-day payments (like coffee).

This is a perfect example of something a lot of people don't realize. David Pogue is no different in his understanding of bitcoin than of everything else he reviews. The difference is that you actually know more about bitcoin than he does. Now if this is his 'review' of bitcoin, imagine what this means for his other reviews---they are the same superficial shit. It's just that since you don't know much about those products, you assume that he does and that he is 'authoritative'. So much for that. 
So, basically most of his readers, who know nothing about bitcoin, will assume now they know everything about bitcoin once they read his 'review'.

This is the first real test that semi-widespread implementation of segwit had and it was amazing to watch. Being able to cram a lot more transactions into blocks really makes a difference. As the percent of segwit transactions rises above 50% it will make even more a positive difference.

Ideas like this will give true credibility to Bitcoin. I can't believe what a visionary Satoshi was.
@_date: 2017-04-01 13:31:50
No it's not...not really if you think about it. The main issue is that this debate is completely stalling advancement on bitcoin. The proper way to activate a softfork like segwit is with 95% miner signalling which we now know will be IMPOSSIBLE. 
However, if they signal segwit and segwit activates with 95% support, then I think having a hard fork to just increase the blocksize limit to 2mb is a GREAT compromise. Yes, I know that segwit already increases it. I just think that I am willing to accept reality in order to move bitcoin forward.
PS. I think there are other reasons behind the opposition to segwit and I don't think the other 'side' will accept this compromise. However, the best thing to do in that case is for segwit supporters to accept it and put the ball in their court.

Yes funny because he writes abou Bitcoin in terms that make him appear stupid. It's even more funny when you realize he's being serious in what he writes--so their CEO doesn't really understand the finer points of how Bitcoin works. He still believes that the most important people for changing Bitcoin are miners. If that's true he should become a miner and change the protocol to give miners 100 bitcoins per block reward. It should be easy to convince other miners of this change. And since miners are the only ones that matter when it comes to making changes to Bitcoin then this change is as good as done. Right? What a moron.

When was a 'good time' to buy? You were saying the same thing in 2015 when it was in the mid-200's. I am SURE you would have been saying the same thing if it was $1--once you had seen it climb from 5 cents to $1. Of course, you would have said the same thing at 5 cents--since you would have seen it previously at .1 cents. And so on. And so on.
Basically, you think bitcoin is some ponzi scheme so the price is ALWAYS 'high' to you. The reason is that you really DON'T understand the technology or what's it's trying to do. Don't feel bad, many people don't understand it either--as can be seen from the current scaling debate. Many think bitcoin is just some kind of fancy payment system. It's not meant to be that.
As a Brazilian, you really need to try to understand fiat money better. I visited Brazil in 2014--I exchanged $1 USD for R$2.35. Then I came back in 2016--the exchange rate was R$4.10 for each USD. As you know, it's now R$3.15. So, a Brazilian who worked and 'saved' money in 2014 has now lost a significant portion of that money. Why should that be the case? Shouldn't your savings hold value over time?
If all people start placing their 'savings' in bitcoin it will help to end the destructive power of central banks that manipulate currencies and basically play with people's lives and savings. Money may actually become a real store of value again.

I have to agree with this. I did some transactions this weekend. Expected to pay massive fees (close to $1). Trezor suggested a fee of 0.00012. I really thought it was an error and wanted to override it and select a higher fee. But, I let it go.

@_date: 2019-04-30 03:24:00
This story you tell is BS. The hack occurred in Aug. 2016. At that time the price of BTC was about $600. So if you had 1 BTC that was 'hacked' then Bitfinex gave you $600 minus the 'haircut' which was about 38%. So you were given $372 worth of BFX tokens. 
If you kept those BFX tokens until they were redeemed 'in full' in April 2017, the price of bitcoin at that time was over $1,600. 
So, you had 1 BTC before the hack and then when the tokens were redeemed 'in full' you don't even have enough money to buy ONE THIRD of a BTC. 
Yeah, it sure looks like Bitfinex gave everyone 100% coverage. Just keep telling yourself that bullshit story. Bitfinex are thieves--have always been. 
That cancer of an exchange should have just died then--it would have been much better for bitcoin. Instead they 'redeemed' the BFX tokens by printing 'Tether' and now look what happened. I sure hope this is the end for Bitfinex, but this field is so full of scammers that I am sure it won't be.

Ok..we will debate the understanding of bitcoin technology some other day. 
However, please tell me as a Brazilian who works and lives there, how do you 'save' for the future? I see that you are not dumb enough to just put your savings in a Real bank account. Right? 
So, do you put them in a Euro or USD bank account? I will assume this is a NO since they are just other currencies. Do you buy gold? (I will assume it's a no on gold). Do you buy real estate? Isn't real estate another 'ponzi' scheme where you are hoping to sell it for more to someone else? 
Do you buy stocks? I hope you didn't buy PBR when it was trading over over 10 times what it is now or ITAU or Bradesco just a few years ago--or worse in 2011 or so when they were many times more than now. So, stocks are a gamble/ponzi also in many ways.

Everything I said about previous history is true. Also, Antpool previously stated directly that they won't mine Segwit blocks. See this from just a few months ago:

You have explained all the big concepts correctly. I think the problem for 'regular' people in understanding this is that they confuse 'money' with 'currency'. The US dollar is not money--ie. it is not a store of value. It's just a currency used as a means of exchange. It is not meant to be 'saved' for later use since it's value in the future will be less than it's current value--this is a design feature. 
Once people understand this the next question they ask is what is money? Well, for a long time gold was money--mainly because you couldn't inflate it's supply very easily. It was also used as a means of exchange. Now bitcoin is trying to become a digital type of gold. We will see if it succeeds.

The original depositor thinks he put $100 in the bank and the guy that sold the equipment thinks he has $90 in the bank. In fact, the bank only has $100. This is super basic economics--we're not talking anything complicated here--or controversial.
New money is created every time a bank gives out a loan. In fact, the idea that new money is created only by central banks is simplistic--only a small amount of all the new money created is made by central banks. Regular, small, community banks (and huge banks) are responsible for the vast creation of new money supply.
@_date: 2018-11-01 20:40:13
You're joking right? It's not rocket science. Let's do a simple example. You put $100 in a bank. The bank loans $90 and keeps $10. The person that got the $90 loan puts it in the bank. You think you have $100 at the bank, the other person thinks they have $90. In fact there is only $100 at the bank. The $90 loan 'created' NEW MONEY !!! 
It happens all the time. That's how the vast majority of money is created--by regular bank loans, not by the central bank.

His letter to the SEC is the first thing I think about when I see that name (This man is truly evil. He sincerely believes that bitcoin is a scam and a ponzi scheme and that everyone involved in bitcoin is an idiot. Ok. I can accept that he believes that. Then he actively works AGAINST bitcoin by writing things that are completely taken out of context and intended to scare people who know little about bitcoin.
THEN, he goes on r/btc and pretends to be some kind of bitcoin 'security' expert and I am truly amazed that anyone in the bitcoin space would give him 1 ounce of credibility. 
The most disappointing thing about r/btc is how he is almost revered there because he is against Core. I see this and always think 'Hey guys...look who you are agreeing with....hello...anyone read his SEC letter?? He thinks we are ALL idiots !! HELLO !!!

Ironically that's the feature that makes them so secure--the fact that you can't use them for anything else. That's why it's so stupid of BCH to use the same POW as bitcoin. It can be killed so easily. Honestly, there can only be on SHA256 POW coin in the world.

I’ll answer your question. You’re getting a lot of crap because it’s obvious you don’t really know anything about ‘crypto’ except for the price of bitcoin. Bitcoin is about much more than the price and for you to say it went ‘wrong’ shows you just don’t understand it. Definitely do not ‘invest’ in it—unless you understand it first. 
As far as price goes, keep in mind that just 3 years ago bitcoin was at $250. There are people here who have had bitcoin since 2010–try telling them the price has crashed. 
What happened last year was a bubble. Bitcoin has had many of them and will have many more. It’s possible for bitcoin to be in a bubble and be undervalued at the same time. In 2012 bitcoin went from $2 to $32 and then back to $3. I’m sure all those that bought at $32 felt like it ‘crashed’ but if they still have those bitcoins they’re way ahead. I can’t predict the future but I guarantee you that at some point bitcoin at $19k will seem ‘cheap’. 
@_date: 2019-04-04 14:16:28
No...there was desire by some people but the actual software client was funded by Bitmain (through ViaBTC). Also, ViaBTC was the sole miner for the fork and without them a fork of bitcoin would not have survived. 
But, given that ViaBTC and Bitmain are scammers, they also gamed the fork to their advantage by mining a TON of blocks in the first couple of months when they purposely instituted a flawed difficulty algorithm. 
I am glad that Bitmain has sold all their bitcoins. They won't be getting those coins back. Good riddance.
@_date: 2018-11-17 04:12:12

As a miner he can do whatever he wants with a block he finds. However no one else in the network would accept such a block. He might as well mine a block that gives him a 1,000 BTC block reward. He will just fork himself off the network. Good luck to him. He’s just a moron.

This may be the case, but it's better to come out in support of something like this compromise early one and then let THEM reject it. This compromise should not be viewed as segwit vs. something else. It should be viewed as segwit vs. no segwit and endless stalling and delaying. In that case, I am ready to move forward. The delay is really hurting bitcoin.

The EXACT same thing was being said in 2015. Tell me what happened between 2015 and today that made the price of bitcoin go from $200 (actually $165 at its lowest) to over $10,000 today? I personally did NOT buy any at $165 even though I was looking at that price live on an exchange where I actually had USD on deposit because I thought it was going to $100--like a TON of other people thought at the time.

No...by lending out the $90 you have 'created' new money and you are now responsible for that money. Same thing happened when you accepted the $100 loan. The total money available is $100 that is owned by the person that lent you $100 since he thinks he has $100--it's just that you owe him that $100. You also have $100 (the $100 you borrowed) and the $90 that you lent out since that person now has $90. So, by one person loaning you $100, $290 of total money now exists--the original $100 plus $190 of 'new' money. Where is this new money coming from? It's coming from the future !! A loan is like using a time machine and borrowing from the future !!
The guy who gave you the $100 is counting on you using that money to somehow generate enough to pay him back $100 plus interest. And you have the same expectations of the person whom you loaned $90 to. As long as all that loaned money is used productively to create something of value that can pay back the original loan plus interest, then everything is ok. So, as long as loans are made responsibly then it's fine. 
Now think about what happened in 2008 with all the banks loaning money for 'mortgages' to people that could not pay it back and you can see why it was a time bomb. Why were they doing this? Because they never kept the loans--they sold them to the federal govt. who was left holding the bag. Federal govt. means all of us.

It makes sense--he is saying if you bought BTC for say $10,000 3 days ago. Today you go and buy a cup of coffee with BTC. What you have just done is you 'sold' some bitcoin for coffee. Since the price of BTC is now higher ($10,100), you have short-term capital gain of $100 per BTC and you owe the govt. $30 on that. Of course, you haven't spent a whole BTC for coffee--just a small portion. Well, it's up to you to calculate your 'profit' on that small portion and report it in your taxes next year. Yeah....I know. But that's the current law.
Edit: Oh wow...I hadn't checked the price when I posted. It's now $11,100 !!! To the moon !! :) So, the 'profit' above per BTC is now $1100 and you have to calculate the partial profit on that !! Basically, today's coffee paid for in BTC you bought 3 days ago is FREE !!! Woohoo  !!!

With bitcoin there is no one to go to to 'taint' the UTXO or to create a 'fork'. That's the ENTIRE point of bitcoin. There is no 'foundation' or company or leader to go to. Name any other coin and I can probably tell you exactly which group of people you need to target in order to force a change in that coin. But not in bitcoin.

That's an interesting idea but from a security point of view it's better if there is NOTHING USEFUL created from the mining equipment (other than heat which is a side product). Ideally the mining device should have no other real purpose because if it can be used for something else then the incentives for its use for mining also change. 
Basically you want to make it so that if the device is used to harm the network then a POW algorithm can make it completely useless and that's an incentive for the owner to follow the rules. If the devices can be re-purposed then that changes the incentives.

It's applicable to ALL forms of 'money'. There can only be one cryptocurrency that is considered 'money' and that serves as a store of value. Bitcoin is definitely NOT there yet but it is the ONLY one with a chance to do that. 
The market can accomodate other cryptos--just not another one that serves the function of 'money' AND 'store of value'. Those holding BCH or any other cryptos that think they are holding money will be left like those holding silver in the late 1800's.

You're right, it's a hard choice. I think the Bluetooth functionality of the Nano X is nice since it means you can spend with an iPhone, but you really don't want to be carrying a device with a lot of BTC on it. So you would need 2 Nano X devices--one to carry around a 'small' amount of BTC and another to use as your main storage.
The other big difference I see at this point is that you really should have a passphrase with these devices and the Trezor T has a bigger screen where you can enter the password directly by picking letters as opposed to the Nano X where you have to scroll with the 2 buttons. So the Trezor T is much easier to use with a passphrase.

I agree with you, but keep in mind bitcoin is fungible. So, if you rebuy bitcoins at the same time you spend them, then you can say you are spending the bitcoins you just bought--so basically no capital gains taxes. But it's trouble to do this so as a customer you really only have an incentive to do this if the merchant were to offer some kind of bitcoin discount. The discount should at least be equal to the credit card processing fee the merchant would pay.

That's NOT what 'HODL' was supposed to mean. Go look at the original bitcointalk thread--you can basically translate HODL as DON'T TRADE. Buy and hold. Don't try to 'buy low' and 'sell high'. 
Of course, you can spend BTC if you need to--just buy more to replace it. 
Don't overcomplicate things.

This is a future price prediction!! Remember when someone took the price of BTC to $3,000 or so on Gemini?

Well, get ready for a BTC price of $90,000 in 3 years or so !!

Two things are true: 1. Mike Hearn ABSOLUTELY did a LOT for bitcoin early on and was a huge asset to bitcoin. This is a fact. 2. He later tried to destroy bitcoin. He seriously misunderstood bitcoin at a very basic level and thought bitcoin was meant to be a payment system--ie. a competitor to paypal. He did not understand the value of decentralization as a key feature of bitcoin and did not care if ultimately only a few huge companies (like Bitmain) ended up controlling bitcoin. Mike Hearn and all other 'early' adopters that didn't value decentralization can now be found in r/btc and have gotten their wish in BCH, which is basically controlled by Bitmain. 
Good luck to them.

Absolutely nothing. Your chain will die from a lack of miners. You would need to change POW and reset the difficulty. Still since it will be worth nothing no one will mine it anyways. 
But, if you had a ‘ton’ of money to promote it and pay people to create a lot of FUD around it by saying yours is the ‘true’ bitcoin then you might gain some traction. But you have to keep up the payments and bribes.
@_date: 2017-09-30 18:31:07
You are asking a very difficult question--define what you mean by 'succeed'? You also talk about 'value'--as in price. That's a completely different topic.
If a 2X fork does occur with over 90% of miners, then it will be extremely difficult for the 1X chain to survive--regardless of how many tweets you read. If it has only 10% hashing power, then there will be a block every 100 minutes or so. However, the % hash rate will probably drop dramatically if the 2X fork is successful because over 99% of the miners will likely move to the 2X chain. They don't do this because of politics--just because of profitability. See what happens with bitcoin cash--miners just switch to whatever chain is most profitable. 
I have no doubt that the 1X chain will survive--most likely there will be a hard fork with difficulty adjustment and POW change to a different mining algorithm. In that case, will it still be bitcoin? 
Now you can see why this debate is getting so heated. The question of value is something completely different and that will be determined by the market place. That's honestly hard to predict. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:51:28
That was TRULY BRUTAL --- from $240 to $55 (77% correction). So, far it's about 65% correction so we have more room to drop !!!

There is no way that's going to happen. That 'compromise' has been discussed for many years now and it's just not going to occur. In any case, from a pure blockchain evolution perspective it makes more sense NOT to adopt 2X now that Bitcoin Cash exists. It would be interesting to follow the progress of both chains and see which one scales better and more easily and gains more mainstream support.
Still, given that 2X will go ahead, I don't see any possible way for the 1X chain to survive post fork than by itself hard forking to a new POW with lowered difficulty. All the Reddit posts and tweets in the world are not going to change this fact. 
Kind of ironic that after avoiding a hard for at all costs for the past 3 years, we are right back to a having to hard fork as the only way forward. Interesting times ahead. I already have my popcorn.

Your statement would be correct if you assume that fiat currency will remain stable and Bitcoin is just some pyramid scheme. However, if you believe that all the debt that's being taken on by governments can only be repaid by printing more fiat then the only logical outcome will be a devaluation of fiat. In that case, gold will win and many people are betting Bitcoin will also.  Why? Because people won't be stupid enough to keep working in order to save fist currency that's being constantly inflated to pay off ever increasing debt. Will this actually happen? I don't know but at this point I'm so sick of the current corrupt economic/political system that I would rather bet on Bitcoin. 
Could Bitcoin collapse completely? Absolutely. I don't believe the political establishment has even begun to 'fight' Bitcoin yet. So we will see what happens. 
I'll just paraphrase a really good quote: Bitcoin is a direct attack on the currently corrupt political system disguised as a get rich quick scheme.

True but in this case the fee is paid by the customer, so it's up to the customer to determine whether the fee is worth paying--and that in turn would depend on the discount that the merchant would give for bitcoin.
Without a discount from the merchant, there really is no good reason for a customer to pay using bitcoin if you have the ability to use credit cards.

Dude you REALLY don't understand either bitcoin or free markets. If you understand bitcoin you would know that exchanges have NO OTHER CHOICE than to call bitcoin the chain with the most work. That's bitcoin. At that point, users have the option to sell those coins or buy more. The users will ultimately decide value. If users decide that B1MB is more valuable, then the miners will shift to mining B1MB and then that becomes bitcoin once it has the most work. That's how it works.

You can do that--but you are not in control of your bitcoins then. The whole point of bitcoin is that you control your money. If you want Coinbase to keep it, you might as well keep it at a bank. The idea is that you use Coinbase to buy and then you transfer to your own wallet that you control. If you want to sell, then you transfer to Coinbase and sell. 
Remember that there have been a lot of isntances of people losing their bitcoins that were at Coinbase--not because coinbase got hacked but because those people's computer was compromised. So, you are not really any safer by keeping bitcoins at Coinbase.

Ok...I'll play along. I hate to agree with the 'standard' opinion on who Satoshi is, but I honestly do believe that in this case the standard opinion is the correct one. If you assume that Satoshi is someone who is extremely competent in the field of cryptography and is well versed in the history of money and economics it all really leads to one person--Nick Szabo. 
I thought this even before Mike Hearn released his batch of emails with Satoshi last year and one of the emails showed an uncharacteristic 'slipup' by Satoshi. He gave Mike a bitcoin address and said that by random chance that address contained his (Satoshi's) initials--the address started with NS.

This collection shows you the true genius of Satoshi. There's no doubt that he is someone (and I do strongly believe he is one person) who was intimately familiar with all the previous work that was done in the 1990's regarding the creation of a type of digital cash system and was well aware of all the previous shortcomings. 
However, I believe that even Satoshi must be surprised at how hugely bitcoin has caught on. For that, I think we need to thank Ross Ulbritch since he was able to create something which gave bitcoin true, real world value.

This is why I'm eagerly waiting for the 2X hardfork. It will finally answer this question about the true meaning of hashrate. 
My belief now is to say that if the hashrate were 51-75% then I may agree that even 75% is not enough to carry out a successful contentious hard fork. However, once the hash rate is over 90%, it's really no longer contentious. 
At that point there is little chance for the minority chain to survive without itself executing some type of hardfork in order to change the POW and adjust the difficulty. If that happens, which chain is really bitcoin? That's the question I really don't have the answer to and I want to see answered in November.
@_date: 2017-09-05 16:19:28
And it's clear from all the correspondence between them in the crypto mailing list that Hal was NOT Satoshi. Also, Hal had saved a few bitcoins that he cashed out later on when he got sick. If he had been Satoshi, he would have cashed out a LOT more !!

Don't believe this lie told by Dimon. The difference is not about digital vs. physical. It's about centralized vs. decentralized. If the USD is truly 'digital' then go ahead and walk into Chase bank with a USB drive and tell them you want to withdraw your 'digital' USD and ask them to put them into the USB drive? They can't. With bitcoin, you can do this.
Also, go into Chase and tell them you want to send some of your digital USD to someone in Asia (or any country) but that the recipient doesn't have a bank account, but they do have a computer. Can they send them some of your 'digital' money to that person? They can't. With bitcoin you can. 
Also, with bitcoin you can send your TRULY digital money to anyone you want, anywhere without having to go to the bank and ask for permission. Try doing that with their 'digital' USD. 
TLDR - the fact that they keep saying that the dollar is now 'digital' is a big lie. It's not. It's the same old money and same old banking system just in electronic form. But they still have control of it--not you. Bitcoin is true digital money that you control. Big difference.

You don’t put a passphrase in (leave it blank) and it shows you your ‘default’ wallet. You should have some bitcoins in this wallet and use this as your ‘everyday spending’ wallet. When you want to enter your passphrase wallet you go into options and enable passphrase. Then you disconnect the Trezor and next time it will ask for a passphrase. Then before disconnecting you disable the passphrase option. Now no one knows that you have a hidden passphrase protected wallet. 
That’s the main point of using a passphrase—as an extra layer of security for your main BTC holdings. If someone were to get your Trezor and force you to show them what’s in it, just enter your pin and they will see your everyday wallet only. No one in the world can tell there’s a passphrase hidden wallet. This setting of deactivating the passphrase option is good to do if you’re ever crossing international borders with the Trezor.

The R3 guy said this before the article was even out--so the article was basically a coordinated hit job on bitcoin. Basicall, yeah, a dick move.

How do you define how the 'market' decides? By measuring the number of nodes? The number of hats they wear? The number of tweets? I agree that it's the users who ultimately will give a coin its value. But you can't really know their true wishes until the fork has actually occurred. 
If you really understand bitcoin there is no other way that the exchanges could have of handled this. The chain with the most work is the true bitcoin. That's a fact. Once the fork happens and users get a choice, then it will become obvious what the 'market' really supports. 
At that point, the chain that the users really want will then become the one with the most POW--just watch and see as the miners will suddenly shift their hashrate to the chain that is most valued by users. But this can only occur AFTER the fork. Then the name bitcoin will revert again to that chain. That's how bitcoin works. It's the only way it can work. There is no other objective way of defining it.

Think of it as there are infinite addresses, each with a private key. The private key is what allows you to move bitcoins from one 'address' to another. A wallet manages all your 'addresses' for you so you don't have to do this process manually when you want to receive and send bitcoins. That's why it's wrong to call a single printed address a 'paper wallet'. It's not a wallet at all. It's just a printed private key. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 23:31:19
This issue keeps coming up over and over again and I will repeat again that running a 'full node' is only useful and helpful if you actually use it to make transactions with your own bitcoins--ie. you use it to receive and send bitcoins.

Jeeezzz. Nobody is answering your question so I will. You are confusing bitcoins with USD. When you transfer bitcoins, you are transferring bitcoins, not USD. There is no reporting. Your friend could transfer 100 bitcoins or 1000 bitcoins or 10,000 bitcoins--she is just transferring bytes of computer code and data. It is not a 'money' transfer.

What I said was the site where you imported your private key into was not the real blockchain.info. You must have gone to a fake site which will accept any login information. Then it gives you a compromised deposit address. Any  bitcoins you transfer there are immediately stolen. Also any private key you enter is immediately stolen. 
How did you go to the blockchain.info site? Did you search for ‘blockchain’ in google and click on the top result? That’s a common trick.

I’m not confused, you are. POW is the only objective way of defining what bitcoin is. The chains don’t have to identical—otherwise there’s no point in overtaking one. There’s no other way than POW for decentralized systems to work and to have miners be able to join and leave at will. Otherwise what will you use—a trusted committee?

By the way, that setting about the passphrase does not tell you if you actually had set a passphrase or not. It only tells you whether the Trezor is setup to ask you for a passphrase as a default. If you set a passphrase and then go into the options and disable the passphrase option, it will appear like you don't have a passphrase but you actually do.

No...zero percent in a new POW wouldn't work. That's just a new chain--but it would be an insecure chain. No one would send transactions on it since anyone could basically take over that new chain. It's insecure, so it's also not viable.

Good except you don't mention the amount you want to buy. If it's significant, then you REALLY should get a Trezor or Ledger hardware wallet and either use those as your wallet or use them along with Electrum. 
There are many, many stories of people losing their bitcoins by using Electrum--not because of Electrum but because their computer got compromised. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 03:14:37
For segwit as a soft fork, you had to have all the miners signal that they had upgraded their software in order to enforce the rules. Otherwise the segwit transactions would appear as 'anyone can spend' and it wouldn't be safe to use segwit unless a vast majority of the miners had upgraded. There was no other way to do it.
@_date: 2017-10-10 23:03:55
That's a ridiculous way of looking at it. You can say $56,000 is a lot of money also--assuming BTC price was $1. How about $10--$560,000 is a lot of money. How about when it's $10,000 then it's $560,000,000 and that's a lot of money. When does it stop? 
Whatever he got for it is what it was worth at the time. If he got enjoyment from tipping, then that was the 'fair' bitcoin price at the time. You can't keep wishing to go back in time only because the price of BTC went up. What if it would have been worth zero today?

Thanks for all your work Andreas. However, I honestly think that the reason this scaling debate has gotten so ugly this year is because many people with technical knowledge have come to the conclusion that there is an influential minority among the core developers who have decided that there will NEVER be a hard fork in order to increase the block size. They will push for Lighting and side chains, but they will NOT increase the block size no matter what because they believe it will never be necessary to do so.
I don't know if this belief is true or not, but I do know that a significant portion of the technical community has come to believe this and it has contributed to the great schism that we now have.

They are going to learn a harsh lesson about what happens when you create a system where miners are in control. As a matter of fact, they are PROUD there to say that miners are the only ones that matter. We will see how that's going to pan out. And mind you this is without any real malicious miner trying to do a 51% on BCH which at this point in time takes a ridiculously small amount of hash power relative to bitcoin. That whole chain is completely unsecure !!

Of course I know what you are talking about. I don't agree with you. There is a movement in the UK and other countries to 'ban' encryption because 'terrorists' use it--which is BS. 
Nonetheless, dumb people keep saying that if encryption is banned, then bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are dead. All I am saying is that if encryption is banned, it will have no effect on bitcoin since there is no encryption used in bitcoin.

I try to stay neutral in this whole debate and I honestly don't know why someone who supports bitcoin cash even cares any more about what happens to bitcoin.

There is NO SUCH THING. Cash deposited into your bank account by someone else CAN BE REVERSED. There was a post about this a last year. Someone sold bitcoin and the buyer deposited cash into the sellers bank account. The seller logged in and saw the cash deposit into his account and released the bitcoins. About an hour later the money was removed from the bank account.
It turns out the buyer went back to the bank with the deposit receipt and told the same teller that he talked to before that he made a mistake on the account and asked for his money back. They gave the cash back to him and reversed the transaction.

@_date: 2017-10-27 18:45:49
You know what...I agree with a lot of what you just said. At heart, bitcoin is just a decentralized payment system. As such it's definitely not better than credit cards--for those who have access to credit cards. But, even for people with access to credit cards, bitcoin gives you the option of having uncensorable payments and this does not necessarily mean only illegal payments. For people in places like Syria, Iran, and Venezuela it can be the only way of making international payments or for taking money out of those countries. 
Also I don't think mining centralization is a fatal flaw--I think it's a temporary problem as you will see more diversity in miners as bitcoin becomes more known. 
Additionally, you are forgetting the fact that many people also view bitcoin as being 'safer' than national currencies because it cannot be manipulated by increasing it's supply arbitrarily. Surely even you must agree that for people in Venezuela and many other such countries in the world, placing their savings in bitcoin (even at current prices) is much better than their local currencies. If you agree with this latter use, then it's just a matter of what value you would ascribe to bitcoin if it becomes a competitor gold as a store of value. This quality definitely has some value that you are not ascribing to it. Whether that value makes the current price too high or too low is another matter--but it is a valuable function none the less.
@_date: 2019-09-18 14:50:59
BIP38 encryption is SUPER STRONG. People underestimate this point. It likely won't happen in his lifetime--especially if he used a long, complex passphrase. It really was the best storage method prior to hardware wallets. I consider however many BTC there are in those addresses 'donations' to the bitcoin network. They are not moving any time soon.

I agree with your comment about F2pool, but ViaBTC is indirectly controlled by Bitmain. They were created by Jihan to 'save' BCH when the hard fork occurred. All the initial investment into ViaBTC came from Bitmain. The fact that it's a different company with a different CEO is just a gimmick.

No it's not. Someone may be claustrophobic or prefer to sleep outdoors so they don't have value for a house. Any food you like, someone else may be allergic to and consider it poison so it has no value to them.
Your entire premise that some things have 'intrinsic' value while others clearly don't have it is ridiculous. We are just going to go around playing linguistic games. 
The bottom line is that 'value' is property that exists in YOUR MIND. The object itself has no property called 'value'. Whatever food you value, I can say is just a bunch of atoms held together by invisible forces and therefore 'worthless'. In that case, ALL things in the world are just a bunch of atoms held together.
Again, all I am saying is that the quality of 'value' is NEVER intrinsic to any object--it's intrinsic to the human mind which is aware of the existence of that object. So, an apple and bitcoin both can have value to different people--it just depends on what a person values. To argue that bitcoin is 'code' and therefore without 'value' is ridiculous. You think you sound smart and that you some special insight into 'value'. Bullshit. 
Bitcoin might have no value TO YOU. That doesn't mean it doesn't have value TO SOMEONE ELSE. And NOTHING in the universe has any 'intrinsic value'.
@_date: 2019-09-06 00:19:16
Unfortunately it’s become that way. If you’re in the USA, the quickest way (and best) to buy bitcoin is to use the CashApp—but it requires providing your drivers license. If you want to have ‘anonymous’ bitcoins, the best thing is to buy them using the CashApp and then transfer them to Wasabi wallet to Coinjoin them. Then you can use Wasabi to send the bitcoins wherever you want and they will no longer be tied to your identity.

@_date: 2019-09-11 20:48:21
Let me put it another way. What can you do if you control 51% of the bitcoin hashpower? You can't create new bitcoins--eg. you can't suddenly give yourself 1000 bitcoins out of thin air. You can't STEAL anyone else's bitcoins--so you can't just look up an address with a TON of bitcoins and say 'hey, I am going to take some of those for me'. All you can really do are 2 things:
1. You can sensor transactions--so, you deliberately choose not to include some transactions in the blocks you make. But, remember you only have 51% hash power so those transactions can be included in the very next block after yours that another miner mines. After all, you only have 51% of the hashpower--not 100% !!!
2. You can TRY to double spend YOUR OWN transactions. So, you can send a transaction to someone and then in the very next block you can try to send it back to yourself. However, even this is risky because you may not get to mine the next block and your second transaction will get rejected by the network as a double spend. Besides, no one will accept an major transaction with just one confirmation. 
And for the right to do those 2 things you are wasting a TON of money on mining. For how long can you keep that up? Is it worth it?
@_date: 2019-09-16 01:05:48

They are not. Let's assume the software is legit. The problem comes if you don't understand how the software works or what it is supposed to do. Electrum connects to servers that are not yours--unless you run your own server. Assuming you don't run your own server, it's estimated the vast majority of Electrum servers are fraudulent ones so when your software connects to them, it behaves normally until the last step--and then you get a message telling you the transaction failed and that you need to 'upgrade' your software and it presents you with a link to copy riddled with malware. If you don't understand all this, it's easy to see how you can start out with a legit version that then gets 'upgraded' to a fake version--and then you lose all your coins.
@_date: 2019-09-06 15:46:31
Yes. We both agree on that. If you want to learn some real criticisms about bitcoin you should spend some time in r/buttcoin. About 99% of the posts there are moronic statements by fools but there are a few people there that are really smart and have some valid criticisms of bitcoin.

That guy is so full of crap when it comes to his altcoin rationalization. First he says they are not money--that they have some 'utility'. But then he says the right way to judge them is to see how many 'hodl' them. 
Why in the world would anyone hodl a 'utility' token. You just use it when you need its utility--of course they DON'T HAVE any utility. 
Secondly, nothing digital can be considered money that is not truly supply capped and none of the altcoins are--even if they say they are it's a lie since the supply is controlled by a small group of people or 'foundation'. 
Bottom line is that the utility has to come FIRST and then there might be value. But not a single altcoin has any utility yet--and therefore none have any real value.

Fair enough. He should start a business then. There are definitely a lot more people out there that have the same problem you had. 
@_date: 2019-09-11 23:01:14
At 80% you can't sensor permanently--you will find just 4 out of every 5 block so 1 blocks of transactions will get through. 
No 'hacker' can get 80% of hashpower--you have to have actual physical control over ASIC machines--those cost a LOT of money to buy/make and a LOT of electricity to run. So, it's costing you a TON of actual real-world resources and money to suppress transactions on the bitcoin network. There is no 'hacking' your way into this.
For how long can you keep doing that? If it goes on long enough you risk the chance that the users of the network (the ones running full nodes) will all basically agree to download a different software version that uses a different algorithm than your ASIC machines use. Now all that money that you 'invested' is immediately rendered worthless and you no longer have control over anything. So, what have you really gained? You managed to sensor transactions on the bitcoin network for a few days--for a cost of billions of dollars. Worth it? You tell me.
@_date: 2019-09-06 14:41:58

The problem is that none of those things threaten the supremacy of the USD as a world reserve currency. Bitcoin does. Like I have said before, 'they' have not even begun to fight yet.

This has been discussed many times. Bottom line:
- They CANNOT steal someone else's bitcoins. For example, they can't take 'Satoshi's bitcoins' or any bitcoins from any other address. 
- They CANNOT give themselves 'free' bitcoins-ie. they can't create new bitcoins out of thin air for themselves.
So, what can they do:
- They can TRY to double spend one of their OWN transactions. So, they can send some bitcoins to an exchange buy something like Monero and withdraw the Monero and then try to take back those bitcoins they originally sent. But this is more theory than practice. No exchange will allow you to trade with bitcoins deposited until there has been at least 3 confirmations and this makes it unlikely for such a transaction to be reversed with just a 51% hash rate.
- They can sensor transactions in the blocks they find--ie. they can make sure no transactions make it into a block. But the question is for how long they can keep this up. This becomes less likely to happen if transactions fees are significant. Would miners leave this 'attack group' in order to allow transactions through and get the transaction fees?
So, at the end of the day, a 51% attack would cost a TON OF MONEY to keep up and there really would not be much benefits for the attacker. The 'attacker' would, however, get more benefits by playing by the rules and just mining normally which is what has occurred the last time some group got 51% hash rate.
@_date: 2019-09-17 21:34:10
No. The block reward of 50 BTC of the Genesis block is unspendable. But any other BTC sent to it are spendable--if you have the private key for it.

Yes..it once created bad addresses so that if you sent funds to your 'receive' address they went to an address that the wallet didn't have the private key for. Another time it created 'weak entropy' addresses where it was trivial for anyone to sweep funds from your address without even having to 'hack' you--they could just calculate the private key for the address from the address itself. 
Those are unforgivable mistakes. And there have been many others where their security has been horrible--eg. sending the password for the web wallet to their servers unencrypted, etc., etc. 
Blockchain.com is a BCH company that is partly owned by Roger Ver. Everyone should stop using any services offered by that shitty company.

Yes...but how did they get Electrum to display this address if the Electrum setup.exe was NOT compromised (as it appears). He must have some kind of malware that just replaces the send address to that the 1GzYF address regardless of the software used to send BTC. Sneaky !! I bet you it might do this even on the Trezor wallet unless you click to show the send address on the Trezor screen also.

If this is what you think, then change the title to ‘I have known about bitcoin since 2013 and I STILL don’t understand the fundamental benefit of bitcoin’. For your information the key feature of bitcoin is decentralization and censorship resistance. Everything else is secondary and scaling while keeping bitcoin decentralized is progressing along just fine. 
It’s super easy to scale if you have a centralized shitcoin—see BCH and BSV. If you believe that scaling is the most important criteria then go sell your bitcoins for centralized shitcoins that claim to value scaling—like the above two or EOS or Nano or any of the other myriad shit/garbage coins. Good luck.

At $100k USD per BTC the world won't look that much different than now--it will happen by the end of 2021 most likely. $1 million USD per BTC is another story. 
Once the USD devalues to $100k per BTC, it will get the attention of the USA government and Wall St. for sure. I anticipate a violent reaction from them the likes we have not yet seen. We will then see the first true, coordinated government/Wall St. attack on BTC. We will see what happens after that.

Well there you go. That's the heart of the disagreement we have right there. We will have to wait and see what happens. 
I believe that in addition to a decentralized payment system bitcoin can and will become a store of value. This latter feature is possible thanks to the thievery of central banks and the inability of governments to control their spending. You can always count on governments to inflate their currencies away.  
If I am right, I expect the price of bitcoin to go higher because I think we will see more currency crises in the future. Bitcoin will go up in price only because the 'value' of those currencies will be declining. If I am wrong, I don't expect the price of bitcoin to drop significantly because there will always be a need for uncensorable payments--you can't put that cat back in the bag now.
We will catch up again 1 year from now and see. :)

Please. That argument applies to bitcoin. In the case of BCH Bitmain could control 100% of the hashrate by switching some of its bitcoin miners to mine BCH.

You are confusing 'entropy' with seed word storage in memory. I don't think you understand what entropy means. 
In any case, the Trezor is fine from an 'entropy' point of view which means that it creates cryptographically secure keys. You are correct that there is a vulnerability in the chip where the seed words can be extracted from memory if someone has physical access to your device. However, this has nothing to do with entropy.

You are not wrong, but you have to take things on a relative scale. The fact is that you are a LOT more likely to lose all your crypto through hacks and malware on your computer than by trusting Ledger or Trezor. If you try to create your own keys and store your bitcoins without the use of a hardware wallet, you will MOST LIKELY be much WORSE off--unless you REALLY, REALLY know what you are doing.

Which path is more beneficial is debatable. If your BRD wallet connects to its own nodes you do have have to trust BRD but that might be better than just trusting ‘random’ nodes. In theory, let’s say someone needs to pay you 5 BTC and you use BRD and let’s say you’re in a location where they know your IP address. That person could setup a bunch of nodes around you that feed your BRD wallet  bad data—eg. a fake chain that’s shows you received the 5 BTC transaction they sent you. In this case it would be better if your BRD wallet connected to BRD’s own nodes since that person would have to compromise those also. 
The best thing, of course, is to run your own node. That way you don’t have to trust anyone—BRD or the random nodes around you. This is really the main reason to run your own node—for your own benefit. It’s not to ‘help’ the bitcoin network but rather to help yourself.

You might be right but like I said before hacking BRD servers would mean someone attacking you also has to hack BRD whereas it more trivial for such an attacker to spin up a ton of fake nodes around you so that your BRD wallet will connect to one of their fake nodes.

Don't forget the most important factor--the users who ultimately give it value. The thing is that you can't really know their true wishes  until the fork has actually occurred. You certainly can't judge it by wearing hats or making tweets, or by running nodes. 
If you really understand bitcoin there is no other way that the exchanges could have of handled this. Chain with the most work is the true chain. That's a fact. Once the fork happens and users get a choice, then it will become obvious what the 'market' really supports.

The reason why they are still used is because the vulnerability you are talking about was just recently disclosed--like just 2 months ago. It is a problem--but it's not as serious a problem as NOT USING a hardware wallet. Look at all the instances of people getting their coins stolen by malware or by downloading fake versions of Electrum. 
The simple fact is that most attacks right now are remote malware attacks and ALL THOSE CASES are preventable if you use a hardware wallet like the Trezor.
For the Trezor to leak your seed the attacker must have actual possession of the device and a lot of technical expertise. I guarantee you that if I gave you a Trezor you would NOT be able to extract the seed from it.

@_date: 2017-10-31 16:03:17
Not really. It simpler with a Trezor but not necessarily better. Technically the point of a passphrase-protected address is that no one should know you have one. So, you have a non-passphrase protected address (with just the seed words, no passphrase) and you have a small amount there that you use to buy things. 
Then you have your main 'stash' behind a passphrase protected address. In the Ledger you can do this easily. In the Trezor, you have to set the option for the 'passphrase' so that you are prompted for it. But if you leave this option on for 'convenience' so that you are always prompted, then if someone forces you to plug your Trezor in and reveal your PIN (eg. the Police or border patrol), then they will also know that you have a 'passphrase' address. So, technically with a Trezor you should not have the passphrase option set all the time. You should go into your main account, activate passphrase setting, then unplug the Trezor, then replug it, then enter passphrase, use the passphrase address, then go into options and disable the passphrase option and then unplug it.

Very good question. What's significant to you? The cost of a Trezor is like $100 and Ledger is like $65. Obviously I wouldn't get one if I had only $100 in bitcoin. 
In my opinion, I would say if you have $1,000 in bitcoin you should consider getting one--if only for the fact that you get to learn about them and how to use them to properly secure your bitcoins.

I agree that the main adoption will come from the third world—places with vulnerable currencies like Argentina, Brazil, and many others in Latin America, Africa, and Asia (Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand). Basically any country where people who want to save for their future will come to realize that they can’t trust fiat currencies.

It's the only answer. Otherwise you are asking how some other currency will be valued against bitcoin. In 20 years there may be entirely new currencies--eg. instead of USD there might well be a new US Federal Reserve coin or everyone will use a Libra-like coin sponsored by a conglomerate of banks. 
Regardless, bitcoin will still exist--no doubt about it. Bitcoin will be the ONLY coin that will have no one in control--a truly DECENTRALIZED coin which is IMPOSSIBLE to create again. Not a single one of the other shitcoins of today will be around in 20 years that's for sure.

I can imagine it. There are people in this world in Africa who endure a lot worse every day. HOWEVER, what is truly astounding is how the standard of living for the average Venezuelan can go from basically being that of a first world country to one that is below that of the poorest countries in the world in less than 10 years. 
People tend to forget that when the Concord was active in the 1970's and 1980's the cities that it flew to were London, Paris, New York, Washington DC, and Caracas, Venezuela.

It's not illogical. When one satoshi equals $1 USD then whatever you can buy today for $1 will cost you $558 then. The USD would just have devalued that much. 
So what's the solution to this problem? The govt. revalues the money supply and introduces new currency so that one unit of the 'new dollar' replaces 500 units of the 'old dollar'. Sound far fetched? It has already happened 3 times in Venezuela in a span of 15 years !!
So, you are right, sending 558 satoshis now is like sending $558 in the future (when 1 satoshi = $1 USD)--but those $558 USD will be worthless at that time.

I honestly think that people at r/btc say they oppose SegWit without really understanding what it is. SegWit is ON-CHAIN scaling, which is what they all say they want. Furthermore, it fixes a lot of very serious problems with bitcoin and creates a lot of efficiency. I really think many of them want to say they oppose 'offchain' scaling (like Lightning Network) but that's not SegWit. SegWit is ON-CHAIN scaling.

Nobody says they are shit. Only that the they don't really care about bitcoin--or understand how it works. To them bitcoin is just another cryptocurrency. 
In fact, I don't think they really even like bitcoin because of it's decentralized nature--they probably like centralized currencies better since they can be controlled by a 'foundation'. That's why Coinbase is working so hard to turn bitcoin into a centralized payment system.
@_date: 2016-10-27 02:59:33
I'm actually surprised to still see a statement like this being posted. The CEO of Coinbase showed himself to be a complete moron about the basics of bitcoin by stating something to this effect. Actually, nodes are extremely important to bitcoin and if you don't understand this then you don't understand bitcoin. 
I will try to explain it in a simple way. Suppose a lot of the miners (let's say 75%)  got together and decided to to alter the software they run so that it changes the rules of bitcoin in some manner (eg. they decided they want to mine bigger blocks or they want to increase the block reward to 100 bitcoins or whatever else they want). What do you think will happen to all the new blocks they create under these rules? Nothing. The blocks will be rejected by the nodes in the network as invalid and won't even be relayed. The node operators are the ultimate arbiters of what actually gets enforced as being the true 'bitcoin'. Whatever blocks the miners create under their own special rules won't be 'bitcoin' and will be rejected.
That's why it's really sad to keep reading about how all that needs to happen to make a change in bitcoin is for miners to decide to do x or do y. People saying this don't understand bitcoin. Even if 99% of miners decided to change something that went against the consensus rules (as determined by the rules that run on the majority of the nodes), it would not work.

However, you need to be aware that it is ALWAYS near the bottom when a TON of posts begin to appear that question the entire value proposition of bitcoin. All the people that bought at $19k and held all the way down will start at some point to think--OMG I think that bitcoin is actually worth ZERO !! That's when they panic sell--at the very bottom !!
This is what I have seen happen in every bubble since I have looked closely at this--starting in April 2013. It's the same story over and over again.

I don't think at all that you are an enemy of bitcoin. In fact, I think you are a great supporter of it. But it's difficult to really understand what bitcoin really is. 
Think about it this way. Let's say that in the future about 51% of miners decide that they don't like the fact that the block reward will be decreasing and they want to keep it at 12.5 btc. So, they get together and agree they will maintain the block reward at 12.5 btc no matter what. So there is a chain split---in the immediate period their chain will have 51% hash power (thus greater total POW) and the other 49%. 
Now you are saying that the market will decided because based on which chain users prefer the price of one chain will drop and the price of the other will rise and therefore miners in the 51% group will switch to the 'true' chain. But let's say that they don't because of ideological reasons--we saw how during the BCH fork initially there were miners mining it at a loss just for ideological reasons so this can happen.
Which is the real bitcoin now? By your definition it is the one with the highest 'work'--the 51% chain with the perpetual 12.5 btc reward. But that's not right. Why? Because the miners changed the consensus rules of bitcoin unilaterally and even though they have the highest POW chain they have created an 'invalid' chain. I think Satoshi himself pointed out such a scenario.
I think Roger is confused. He created a new coin FROM BITCOIN--but it is NOT bitcoin. I think he would do himself a great favor by just realizing this and working to make his new coin 'better' than bitcoin instead of wasting a lot of energy trying to confuse people by claiming it is the 'real' bitcoin. IT IS NOT.

This makes no sense. At the time you didn't know it was going to crash soon after. 
I didn't buy at $19k because I thought it was way overpriced. But I also didn't buy at $5k, $6k, $7k, $8k...you get the picture. Each time BTC crossed these boundaries it was at an ATH. You should have heard the people buying in April 2013 at $250 when a couple of days later it was $35. They were foolish and stupid ONLY if they sold at $35.

The number of nodes of a few percentage of determined users is irrelevant without mining hashpower. Show me that you have at least 20% of hashpower and then we can talk. But right now you have essentially ZERO and are HOPING to get some--but AFTER you cause a chain split. That's CRAZY.

I'm sorry but I see this idea of UASF with 20% of hashrate as an absolute disaster and it sets a horrible precedent for the future. I support Segwit, but I am not willing to cause (not just risk) a chain split for it. Segwit is good, but it's not the only way forward. If Segwit can't reach concensus, then we have to find something else that will. The damage to bitcoin will be huge from a chain split.
Besides, think about the future. How is it 'fair' that people in the years 2009-2016 were able to get 'cheap' bitcoins? What about those who were just children then? It was not their fault they were born 'late'. So, in the future (maybe 20 years from now), I can see people calling for an 'increase' in the number of bitcoins to allow those who were 'born later' to acquire some at 'reasonable' prices. Those people will get together and propose a UASF that will double or tripple the number of bitcoins. If they manage to get just 20% of the hash rate, then they should be able to create a UASF chain split? I know that anyone can do attempt a UASF, but it sets a horrific precedent to support this concept at this time. 
Maybe there is something I'm missing. For what it's worth,  I do believe that going forward with UASF with at least a reliable 51% of hashrate would be more acceptable.
@_date: 2017-05-31 21:09:42
I'll play. It depends on what happens:
- UASF chain that persists - bitcoin below $1,000 for sure. Good buying opportunity. By bitcoin, I mean the real bitcoin--not the UASF chain. Go UASF !! -- because I need to pickup more sub-$1,000 bitcoins !
- Segwit2x activates - definitely in the $4,000 price range for bitcoin--if not more.

@_date: 2016-10-27 03:34:38
I think a big part of the misunderstanding in the bitcoin community right now lies in the fact that many people don't really understand this basic concept: a DECENTRALIZED system can NEVER function as efficiently as CENTRALIZED when it comes to processing payments/transaction. By its very nature, decentralized systems are extremely inefficient as a payment system. The only advantage to having a decentralized system is that (hopefully) it is harder to shut down. 
Bitcoin is supposed to be decentralized (and hard to shut down). It will never be able to compete with centralized systems like Visa/Mastercard as an efficient payment network. However, it will be able to compete in terms of letting you make payments to whomever you want without having to go through any 'central' authority. I think there is tremendous value in this ability.
Honestly, I don't really understand what companies like Coinbase are trying to create--do they really think they can build a payment system to compete with Visa that uses bitcoin? In order for that to happen they will have to turn bitcoin into a centralized version of Visa--but what's the point of doing that? What have we gained by doing that? I understand Coinbase might make more money but bitcoin will be destroyed. Maybe in the future there will be layer-2 solutions that will allow bitcoin to scale to Visa levels while remaining decentralized. 
But, if you lose decentralization you lose what bitcoin is all about. I wish more people understood this simple fact.

Sorry dude, I am glad you're back but I don't buy your reasons for selling AT ALL. It's BULLSHIT. 
I watched your sell wall live. You sold in October of 2014--the scaling debate and Roger Ver were nonissues then. The biggest issue was that the Silkroad coins were being systematically liquidated and flooding the market. Also, many people thought you were very smart to sell in Oct. 2014. Remember that after the Bitstamp hack in Jan. 2015, bitcoin traded as low as $160. You had a large portion of 2015 to get back in and buy for below $300. 
The scaling debate you are talking about did not begin in earnest until the fall of 2015. Roger Ver himself did not start to become demonized until late 2016--and that was mostly because of BU, which was not an issue in Oct. 2014.

It makes no difference because a true hodler doesn't care about the price. I meant hodler as someone who believes in the technology regardless of the price--not a trader interested in converting it back to fiat. 
For those people, it really makes no difference to buy now. They are always buying small amounts to increase their btc holdings--regardless of the price. They were buying at $19k and at $6k. They will hold even if it drops to $100 or $10 or $1. There really are such people. :)

Also, keep in mind that many people are confusing 'on-chain scaling' with 'off-chain' scaling. A lot of people keep saying they want on-chain scaling and that's why they oppose segregated witness--but they don't realize that seg-witness is ON-CHAIN scaling. 
I think they are trying to say they are against offchain solutions like Lightning network, but this is a separate issue from Seg-Witness, which again is ON-CHAIN scaling.

If it's true they have 83% of hashrate, then it's clear there will be 2 chains--the segwit/2mb hardfork one and the current one. However, the current chain will need some kind of POW change to survive. I don't think any exchanges will even list it without explicit replay protection so it might as well implement a POW change. Interesting times ahead.

That's not really fair. I don't like Bitmain, but I do like Bitpay. A moth ago there were not 200,000 transactions in the mempool and the fees were not 420 sat/byte. It's becoming increasingly difficult to use bitcoin in any practical manner--and they do run a business that actually has to make bitcoin transactions. 
I'm not saying I agree with Bitpay's current stand. I'm just saying you can't ascribe their motivations simply to influence from Bitmain. There has been a significant deterioration in the practical use of bitcoin for anything less than a $50 transaction in the past month.
@_date: 2017-05-30 22:07:45
The one thing that simply cannot be denied is that for people who have to actually use bitcoin to make transactions several times a day, the system has become virtually unusable. That's a different reality than just 2 months ago. 
Thus, waiting and doing nothing is really not an option any more. That's why I strongly support this segwit2x compromise as a way to move bitcoin forward. I wish you the best.

The answers to your questions are still being debated today. Just look at all the comments on r/btc. All they care about is low transaction costs--they want fees to be low so that you can buy coffee with bitcoins. That's all they care about. To them, bitcoin is just a medium of exchange. You get bitcoins when you want to buy something over the internet and then you send off those bitcoins. There is no reason for anyone to 'hold' bitcoins--it doesn't make sense to them. 
In fact, many of the big names in bitcoin had a ton of bitcoins at one point and they basically gave many of them away. Why not? I mean to hold on to bitcoins is 'crazy'. What's the point of that? If you ever want bitcoins again, you just buy more !
Warren Buffett said the same thing. He said that bitcoin is a great innovation for transacting over the internet. He recognized that feature of it--it can be used to pay for things across long distances. I can buy something from India and pay that guy in bitcoins directly--great. However, paper checks were also a great invention--but they don't hold any value in and of themselves. In other words, bitcoin is useful but it has no actual 'value'. Of course, most people here (me included) disagree.
We see bitcoin as a better store of value than the USD, which is constantly being inflated by the fed. We think of it as 'digital gold' and one of it's key properties is that it's limited and decentralized--therefore it can't be controlled.
The r/btc people don't care about decentralization--they have said nodes don't matter and they don't care if the 'rules' of bitcoin are controlled by one Chinese miner--as long as transactions are cheap, they could care less.
As to who is right, well that argument continues today.

I would 100% agree with you if segwit signaling was at 94%. But, given that it's at 30% (even less since F2Pool only signaled to avoid DDOS attacks), then you're saying UASF is a fix for a 70% attack since 70% of the hashrate is not mining segwit.
@_date: 2017-05-03 21:02:32
I'm pretty sure he did. But, by 'bank' he doesn't mean a bank that has branches open for the public and takes deposits from 'regular' people. I'm sure he's talking about an offshore bank that does NOT accept deposits from 'regular' members of the public. The requirements for those banks are not as onerous as a 'consumer' bank.
@_date: 2017-05-31 23:52:02
No man you're not missing it--it's just confusing. There is a very small movement of very loud people that want to activate segwit by UASF. UASF doesn't activate anything. They basically will fork themselves off the bitcoin network. If their chain persists then bitcoin will be split. This will cause confusion and likely lead to a massive drop in price of the 'real' bitcoin--the one that is NOT UASF. The reason for the price drop is that the number of bitcoins have been essentially doubled--not the real bitcoins, but this will still create a lot of confusion among the public. 
Expect to read stories of how there are two bitcoins. I believe the price will then drop to below $1,000 from sheer panic. At this point you can buy 'cheap' bitcoins--but don't buy the UASF bitcoins since those are crap.
If segwit2x activates, then the UASF becomes pointless and doesn't happen. In this case, I expect the price of bitcoin to be around $4,000. In this case, there will be only one bitcoin.
So, either scenario will be good. On the one hand the price rises dramatically if UASF fails and on the other the price drops if UASF goes through but then you get a chance to buy cheap bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 05:14:32
There is no other realistic way of getting segwit activated this year. UASF has ZERO mining support. Without that, it's useless. If you don't understand that, then you don't understand bitcoin. 
A few users running UASF nodes that don't do anything CANNOT effect a change in bitcoin--it's that simple. You can run all the nodes you want, it doesn't matter and bitcoin doesn't care. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 09:31:23
Wow...so you will install software on your node that will cause a chain split and that only about 10% of users will recognize. No exchanges or payment processors will see that chain. Over 80% of the hashrate (likely over 95%) will be on the other chain and you think this will be fine? Ok..let's wait and see.
@_date: 2017-05-28 04:02:22
He didn't dump at the very bottom. That's why his story is bullshit. He sold in October 2014. The bottom was Jan 2015 after the bitstamp hack. But Bitcoin traded around 250 for most of 2015 so he was smart to sell when he did. He had a whole year to buy back below his sale price. The scaling debate was not even an issue in Oct. 2014. I don't know his motivation for posting but the reasons he gave for why he sold are complete BS. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 22:02:58
There will definitely be a chain split but hopefully it will just segregate a very vocal minority into their own dreamland little fork of bitcoin on which they won't be able to transact at all because there will be no mining in it. I'm sure they will keep it alive but it will be of no consequence. This is bitcoin. Having nodes running software is useless if you don't have mining.
@_date: 2017-05-30 04:44:50
You don't have any power as a user if you just run a node that does NOTHING but relay transactions. I DARE all the people who want this UASF crap to start making transactions with their bitcoins immediately after the  chain split they trigger. I especially want them to send them to other users who have NOT upgraded to UASF. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 11:06:10
The old chain will NEVER be dead--you can be sure that there will be scammers trying to keep it alive in order to fool people into believing it's the 'real' bitcoin. It doesn't matter though--but you should expect it. 
The dangerous thing for bitcoin is not that the old chain will remain alive, but that the current majority chain will remain practically unusable--as it basically is right now with such massive fees. This may not be felt by HODLers but it's definitely being felt by anyone that transacts daily in bitcoin. 
Therefore, I hope that this agreement gets implemented and that we can move bitcoin forward.
@_date: 2016-05-18 22:50:14
I never got the impression that discussing 2mb blocks is a taboo subject here. It was discussed for a LONG time and most bitcoin developers felt it was a bad idea. I believe you can discuss it again here at any time. I think what happened was that when a 2mb hard fork was rejected, some people started to promote a 'roundabout' way of doing that  by encouraging the use of alternate clients (eg. BitcoinXT &amp; Bitcoin Classic) that would shift control of the bitcoin protocol to a few people who may have different agendas. I think that promoting the use of those clients is what's not allowed here because it is seen as creating an 'alternate' bitcoin protocol--ie. an altcoin. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 23:22:04
If 3 months from now it's much higher then it was a good buy. If it's much lower then it's still a good buy but you may have to wait 3 years for it Togo back to that price. If you can't do that then you're better off not buying Bitcoin at all. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 06:37:39
What difference does the percentage of nodes make if there won't be almost anyone mining the UASF chain? A few days ago people kept talking about Bitfury and F2pool. Well, both of those signed the Silbert agreement, so I don't understand how you can have a UASF with almost zero hash power.
@_date: 2018-04-03 16:12:29
I agree with everything you said. What I can't figure out is what the hell happened with Gavin !!! How the hell did Wright fool him ?? I have to assume it was just a simple 'slight of hand' type trick where I bet the 'new' laptop they got was not really new at all.
@_date: 2017-05-27 19:28:01
It's not a fear. You just described a likely scenario. The true bottom will be apparent when you start reading posts from all the people who bought at 2800 stating that this was the biggest, dumbest mistake they ever made and that they have finally sold all their shitty bitcoins and they never want to hear the word Bitcoin ever again. Probably will happen after the price has been at $900-$1000 for several months. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 06:00:45
Man, I wish you luck. I believe you mean well. And you certainly understand bitcoin much better than me. I just don't understand how for the past year we have been talking about avoiding 'contentious' changes to bitcoin and even just a few months ago there was discussion of how horrible a BU fork would be with only 75% of the hashpower and yet here we are here talking about openly advocating for a chain split--for what? To activate segwith NOW? Is it that urgent? Is it an emergency? Really? 
Why not just let it run it's course and then see what happens? What happened to not making hasty contentious changes? 
I can't believe that you are willing to risk a certain chain split just to try to prove a point. The UASF will likely fail and then it will be that much harder to get segwit activated at all. 
But, like I said before, you know more about bitcoin than me, so good luck.
@_date: 2017-05-30 15:23:10
It's sad that it has come this. I see a major split in bitcoin coming. Like it or not, this agreement will result in bypassing Core. If they really have over 90% hashpower, then it's a very serious threat. Anyone who thinks they can just laugh this off is fooling themselves--and no UASF will not work. That's a worse joke that will end in a chain split and it will NOT result in miiner activation of segwit.
Turbulent times ahead for bitcoin.

Nobody has yet explained to me who is going to mine a UASF chain if Bitfury, F2pool, and BTCC--the biggest pools signaling Segwit all go along with the compromise agreement. 
Even if UASF goes along and the people running those nodes cause a chain split, who will mine that chain? Honestly, UASF just appears as pure madness to me--not a serious proposal.

Distract from what? If Segwit is activated by miners it's a million times better than deliberately causing a chain split with UASF. It's insane to have a small group of people deliberately causing a chain split with no mining. Whatever. 
Should be an interesting learning opportunity for all. We will see how UASF with zero mining and only a few number of people running it turns out.
@_date: 2017-07-06 21:53:05

@_date: 2017-05-30 06:32:30
Now you're splitting hairs again. There is a difference between 'upgrading' when it's an accepted change that everyone agrees with and some miners are basically too lazy to upgrade--like the situation that happened before. 
What's happening now is quite different. You have a small and determined (and loud) number of users who want to try to force a change in bitcoin that is clearly contentious and you're saying that if miners don't upgrade to that change then they are causing the chain split? That doesn't make sense.
Bitcoin is worthless if a small number of users running nodes can effect a change that the vast majority of the people with the actual hashpower don't want to make. Now, if that change was serious and important enough that almost every single exchange and every single merchant wanted it, then maybe I could see that happening---that would be a REAL UASF. But, in that case, I am sure that many miners would be on board too. That's not the situation now.
As it is, the current BIP 148 doesn't even have a majority of users on board, much less businesses and exchanges. And since it has almost no mining support, I don't see any possible way in which it can succeed. The only thing it will achieve for certain is in causing a chain split. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 22:54:11
Wow...Wow...I was beginning to think I was crazy for believing the same thing!! I strongly support Segwit and I want it activated but this UASF is absolutely the WRONG way to go about it. I have asked several times how people can possibly believe that creating a deliberate chain split helps that cause at all by starting a UASF without almost ANY mining support or support from a CLEAR economic majority. 
It would be a sign of a MASSIVE FAILURE in bitcoin if a small group of determined users can force the ecosystem to adopt a change they want simply by starting a UASF without any clear hashpower behind it. All they will succeed in doing is creating a chain split. That's all.
That's why I strongly support the Silbert compromise. I see no other way of getting Segwit activated this year. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 05:46:47

@_date: 2017-05-30 06:15:29
Well now that sounds like lawyer-talk. You know you don't have over 51% of the hashpower. So, come Aug. 1st, the first non-segwit signaling block that's mined will create a chain split. Since approximately 70% of the hashpower is NOT signaling segwit, then a UASF is certain to cause a chain split. 
Arguing about whether the miners caused it is just semantics--they didn't 'cause' it because they will just be continuing to do what they have been doing--mining non-segwit signaling blocks. That's their choice to make. 
So, the actual chain split will be caused by the UASF nodes that will reject those blocks and basically fork themselves off from the main bitcoin network.

Like I said you are GAMBLING on this to occur, but the price of the gamble is a certain chain split. That's crazy. I don't know why people just refuse to see this. The cost is too high to try something like this. Activating segwit this way is not worth the price, which is a chain split.

Now $1 USD will get you 4,000 bolivars but there is nothing in the country to buy with them. The government has destroyed the currency and the economy. If you had bitcoin as a Venezuelan you would be infinitely better off today because you would have money to get the hell out !!

Sorry but this story doesn't make any sense. If it's true he doesn't have the private keys, then how come he was able to 'sign' statements for Gavin, Jon, and others using block  and block  That's what they have all publicly stated. He HAD to have the private keys to do that. If not, then either those people are lying about the signing or they were tricked. 
If they were conned, then they should just admit it publicly so people can at least have some facts about exactly what happened at the signing event.

Wait until mid November and you will have a chance to pick up sub $1,000 bitcoin. The segwit drama was nothing compared to what will happen around the time of the hard fork to 2MB. There will definitely be two viable bitcoin blockchains at that time.
@_date: 2017-07-31 01:52:30
Interesting for sure. Given all the discussion around UASF, I can safely predict that there will be two dominant bitcoin chains around mid November. One chain will be the Segwit 2X fork which will clearly have the vast majority of hashpower behind it. The other chain will be a determined minority which will stay on the current 1MB branch and will have a minority of hashpower behind it. This chain will be made up mostly of many former UASF supporters. Each chain will insist that they are the 'REAL' bitcoin. 
My guess is that the vast majority of exchanges will list the Segwit 2X cahin as 'Bitcoin' since it will have the majority hashpower and the most work on its chain. The minority chain will then be left vulnerable to attack and it will have to hard fork in order to change its POW algorithm and adjust its difficulty. It's supporters will still insist that despite a POW change, it is the 'real' bitcoin.
Yes..the next 3 months should be interesting indeed. A lot of DRAMA to look forward to. :)

He asked about the value of bitcoin--my answer addresses that directly. Unfortunately there are two clear camps as to what the future of bitcoin should be--a store of value or a unit of transaction. I believe it can be both but that you will need layer 2 solutions for the unit of transaction capability to be truly useful. Many people today feel that it should only be a unit of transaction with low fees and don't want any layer 2 solutions. If this latter philosophy wins then the value of bitcoin will adjust accordingly.

We keep talking here about all the FUD from banks and the government about crypto and yet people just accept some FBI filings blindly. 
TOR has been infiltrated by the FBI--that's plain and simple. Anyone who uses TOR thinking it provides any kind of anonymity is an idiot--especially after these arrests. It's also apparent that some encryption algorithms are also broken--but the FBI doesn't want to admit this publicly.

The EXACT same thing was said around the ETH hardfork in regards to ETC. I remember it exactly. No miner will mine ETC, all the developers are in ETH, etc. etc.
In any case, I personally don't want a split, but there is a HUGE philosophical divide in bitcoin and a split is inevitable. I think the 1MB chain will have to implement a POW change. 
Nonetheless, there will be enough of a panic to drive the price  below $1,000 during that time.

That's not really fair.  I'm not sure I agree that this is their motivation. A moth ago there were not 200,000 transactions in the mempool and the fees were not 420 sat/byte. It's becoming increasingly difficult to use bitcoin in any practical manner--and they do run a business that actually has to make bitcoin transactions.
I'm not saying I agree with Bitpay's current stand. I'm just saying you can't ascribe their motivations simply to influence from Bitmain. There has been a significant deterioration in the practical use of bitcoin for anything less than a $50 transaction in the past month.

@_date: 2017-07-13 20:56:16
The 2MB hard fork will happen. There is no question about that. The only question left to answer is if it will succeed or not. That depends on whether the 2MB hard fork is embraced by miners and users. We know the miners support it and we will see about the users in about 3 months. 
Then we will have a final decision one way or another. The main thing is that this divisive and destructive debate will finally end. At least there will be a decision.
@_date: 2017-07-15 22:36:39
This above all !!! I mean all we know about segwit2x FOR SURE is that it will lead to the activation of Segwit. In my opinion that's a VERY GOOD thing for bitcoin. 
We don't even know if the 2x hardfork part will succeed. But people are talking about Segwit2X like it's the END OF THE WORLD. The hyperbole is getting completely out of hand !!
@_date: 2017-05-24 07:35:08
I don't understand this. Practically all the miners supporting Segwit signed this--Bitfury, F2Pool, BTCC. I don't understand who is left to even mine a UASF chain. It's nowhere even close to getting the 20% people talked about just a few days ago. Unless I am missing something fundamental, I have no idea how a UASF could possibly work with negligible hashrate.
@_date: 2017-05-17 15:02:54

The issue of fee estimation accuracy is a very important one. The bitcoinfees site is contributing to high fees by giving misleading information. Unfortunately high fees (over $1) really do affect how people perceive and use bitcoin. I believe that very serious damage has been done to the reputation of bitcoin when fees were over $3 and sometimes $5. 
What made it worse was that so many people cheered these higher fees and thought that it would be ok if they even went higher. This is insane thinking if you want bitcoin use to become more widespread.

I think this is the key point. If the 1MB chain has any kind of significant hashpower (anything more than 20%) then it's likely the hard fork to 2MB will be considered a failure. 
But at this point, it looks like the 1 MB chain will not even have 5% hashpower. But who knows what will actually happen. The same thing was being said prior to the Ethereum hard fork. Should be fun to watch !

Honestly, we have had two years of discussions like this. It's enough. Everyone already knows where they stand. No mailing list or blog posts or tweets are going to change anyone's opinion at this point. In few months there will be a 2 MB hardfork. Nothing can change that. 
The question is whether it will be successful or not. Either way, it's time to find out once and for all. We all need to finally move beyond constant argument and paralysis.
@_date: 2017-07-31 07:34:39
Mid November will be the time to really see what will happen. One likely option is that all those nodes running Core software will be off the new 'bitcoin' network. It will depend a lot of hashpower. If the 2X chain has about 95% of the hashpower then all those core nodes will be left behind in a minority chain that will have to hardfork in order to adjust the difficulty and change the POW. Otherwise, it will be trivial to attack this chain and therefore it won't be secure or viable. 
Basically, the nodes will be on a 'Core' chain of bitcoin--a completely different chain. That's what I think will happen, but I could be wrong. We will see. As I said, should be interesting to watch.

Listen to yourself dude. I don't support BU but they didn't try to hard fork even when during some periods they had over 50% of the hashpower. That's because they know it would be stupid do so. Now your are advocating a chain split with basically zero hashpower. Wow. 
Sometimes I think the world has gone crazy but then I have to tell myself it's just a few crazy people that have just become very very loud.

@_date: 2019-05-08 08:42:05
No software changes are needed. You are right that the individual nodes will ignore that transaction and won't relay it. But if almost all miners coordinate and create a longer chain with more work and then release that chain all of a sudden, even the nodes that previously rejected the transaction will accept the new longer chain with the most work. This is how POW work. It's just that it's almost impossible to create such a chain.

I think it's fair to say that Roger Ver, Jihan, and Gavin have clearly said that most people should not be running full nodes. 
I never had the impression that Erik has said this or believes this. As for Craig Wright, who cares what he thinks--he's just a scammer.
@_date: 2017-05-17 15:20:05
I just looked at bitcoinfees.21.co and it's quoting 420 sat/byte !! There is no way that such a fee is practical for a payment of less than $25--even then that's almost a 7% fee. So, basically right now it's practical to use bitcoin to send only over $50. You can't tell me that you seriously don't see this as a problem.
@_date: 2017-05-31 22:20:29
Good luck. Keep in mind this is bitcoin. You can have as many loud people running UASF nodes as you want--without mining, it's pointless. 
Keep screaming UASF and see how many miners that will attract. You can even distribute more hats. Bitcoin is not about reddit posts or hats or tweets. If you don't have mining, you have nothing. 
As of right now, the only viable and realistic proposal to get segwit activated is the segwit2x proposal. All the hats and tweets and reddit posts in the world won't change that fact. By the way, I want segwit activated. I don't really think a 2mb hard fork is necessary, but I am willing to compromise on that in order to move forward since I don't think it will cause any harm (if done properly).
@_date: 2017-05-29 23:02:23
This is exactly right. I am sure it will be kept alive by crooks who want to fool people into thinking it's the 'original' bitcoin. I am not saying that the people supporting it now want this--I believe they are earnest in their beliefs but the scammers will come soon enough to try to convince people how they have 'original' bitcoins. It's a setup for disaster. The only thing BIP 148 is certain to do is cause a chain split and help scammers and crooks. That's all.
@_date: 2019-05-13 11:40:41
Yeah..that's it. Gonna give up. After all, it turns out that in between supposedly moving tons of drugs around the world, Satoshi had time to not only create bitcoin but also start a forum where he answered questions about it and helped out noobs. Also, what better way to launder all your illicit profits than by creating a system that incorporates an OPEN transaction ledger. Makes total sense. /s
PS. Most likely this is yet another scam of Wright--trying to somehow link some nefarious person to bitcoin so that he can claim some dubious connection to that person. What a loser. Wright has ZERO connection to the origins of bitcoin.

The coins were NOT cheap. He sold in October 2014 at $300. By Jan. 2015 it was at $180 and through most of 2015 it traded at around $250. So, he was SMART to sell then. 
The last batch of Silkroad coins was rumored to have sold at $227. The bearwhale could have easily bought back all his bitcoins for less than $250 each through most of 2015. That's why the reasons he now gives for why he sold are pure BS. Any way you look at it, it was a good decision to sell in Oct. 2014 for $300.
$300 bitcoin is only cheap now in retrospect. Just like $700 is cheap now.

I don't really know deribit. But, yeah Bitmex is a another total scam. I just forgot about them since they mostly geared at active traders and not at 'regular' users like Binance. 
Honestly, this entire field needs to get rid of places like Bitfinex and Binance and Bitmex in order to minimize the playing fields available to scammers. Getting rid of Bitfinex and Tether will help massively. 
We can already see this as anyone with half a brain that has Tether should be selling it for BTC and withdrawing the BTC--if they are able to. I expect that soon Bitfinex will 'temporarily' pause BTC withdrawals--just like Mt. Gox did.

@_date: 2019-05-13 17:24:24
I would generally agree EXCEPT that Roger Ver kept posting the EXACT SAME THING as bitcoin was approaching $1,000. And then he BOASTED how he had sold a lot at over $1,000 when BTC went down to about $800. But look how that turned out !! He was a LOSER then too.
@_date: 2019-05-18 13:01:46
Because their operational model is flawed. You have to TRUST them to send you back your coins. You want to make your coins untraceable so you have to send them to anonymous people on the internet and you trust they will send them back to you? There are a ton of examples of people sending a ‘small’ amount as a test and they get that back. Then they send a larger amount and they never get that back. The successful scammers and thieves don’t do it to EVERYONE—it’s selective scamming. But why take any chance? Especially when most mixers use crappy algorithms that can be easily deanonymized. Just use Wasabi wallet. No need for mixers any more.

@_date: 2019-05-13 08:35:07
Hmmm. There’s 2 issues with your assumption. Even an exchange as large as binance didn’t notice the hack until at least a couple of hours later. It was significantly more than 6 blocks—I think it was 50 confirmations later. Second, I think the secondary fallout from attempting a re-org to remove a hack transaction are still relevant. That is, it would seriously harm the value of bitcoin and therefore any ‘reward’ the 80% hashrate miners get for doing this will be worth much less. So I don’t think it makes economic sense to deliberately attempt such a re-org. The miners would be hurting themselves massively in the long term. In any case, I think the debate about this will hopefully be over once something like Matt’s Betterhash is implemented.
@_date: 2019-05-11 17:03:12
Yeah. Those people are crazy. Bitcoin is global. In fact it has very little benefits for Americans—for now. My point is that bitcoin is money. You should not trade money for currency. Unless you’re a trader. In that case, go ahead and sell and try to buy back lower. Good luck with that. Look at all the ‘professional’ traders that were shorting bitcoin at $4,800 and at $5,700 and at $6,450. If you want to play that game then that’s a totally different scenario. But this sub is not for traders so you won’t get much insight from here.

Anyone can propose a POW and create a new alt-coin. In fact, I am 100% sure that some people will do that and that a very tiny minority of people will go along--at least initially. That's not what matters.

You are correct. If you lose 8 words you are probably ok, but losing 16 would be bad. This is also why people who use only the Model T and have 12 word seeds should NOT do a 2 our of 3 split that uses 4 words each. Too risky if you lose even one sheet with 4 words.

Basically what you are saying is that for most people in the USA money works well and they really don't need anything like bitcoin, which is basically a new type of decentralized money. However, if you live in any country where money doesn't work well--eg. in most of the world, then it doesn't take much to appreciate bitcoin. 
But, even for those people it does take time to actually understand and use bitcoin because they have to get over the concept of what is 'backing' bitcoin. Basically, bitcoin is backed by the same thing that backs all money in the world--people's faith in it. That's it. Nothing else. This goes for gold too.

I'm not sure. This statement needs to be more specific. Does he mean increase the non-witness portion to 2MB? Because I honestly believe that segwit by itself will give about 2mb blocks. But, many people won't accept just segwit as a compromise. 
However, if he means that in addition to segwit, he also supports a hard fork to increase the non-witness size of the block to 2MB then he should say that clearly.

I agree. That means it was binance that was hacked. Last year individual customers were hacked and they reported that they had 2FA active on their accounts. Instead of doing a thorough investigation, CZ just told them they were idiots for getting malware on their computers and said Binance was not responsible. Now we know those were test hacks and that Binance was in fact being hacked then.

Technically he didn’t choose to disappear at the time he did. He left immediately after Gavin met with the CIA.

Exchanges are not an issue. They are followers not leaders--they wouldn't dare not implement an upgrade if it is clear there is support for it. Look at all the other garbage coins supported by exchanges--since when has an exchange said they won't implement ANY UPGRADE of ANY shitcoin that they already support? For bitcoin, any upgrade will be brainless to support--once the code is released and users download it and install it, there is no question that exchanges will implement it. Same goes for any miners that are still mining bitcoin today. 
I think the whole segwit fight has just left everyone with bad feeling about implementing upgrades but it is overblown at this point. I'm glad that BCH exists now--all those loser users and miners are gone from bitcoin and can concentrate on their own garbage coin. Good riddance.
@_date: 2019-05-11 17:44:06

The idea that miners have a ‘veto’ is what we need to get away from. Even under BIP 9 it was never meant as a veto—just a way to signal readiness. Bitmain transformed it into a veto because they wanted to continue earning illicit profits from covert ASICBOOST. That’s not an issue any more. 
So, basically I’m saying that BIP 9 is a good softfork activation method and we should not let traumatic memories about segwit activation prevent it’s future usage. It’s a lot more efficient to use BIP9 and have a softfork possibly activate in 1 month than to set a 1 year flag date.

They are STILL waiting for sub $1,000 bitcoin !! 
So, if you had just bought at $6,000 and held you would be much better off now. 
Same thing happenned in 2015 when 'everyone' thought $300 was the 'bottom'. Many analysts said we are going lower than $300. Then it went lower. But, the same thing occurred. Those people were all waiting for sub $100 bitcoin and they never bought--even at $300.

Ok. I see the confusion. You’re right that software changes are needed but those are to the pool software—not to bitcoin core. Some miners may use bitcoin core and actually validate blocks but you don’t have to do this to mine. It’s risky but many do it believe it or not. 
The bottom line is that no software changes to Bitcoin core itself are needed. Just an adjustment of the pool block-building rules which is easy to do for miners.

There’s two types. Those who said it’s going to $1,500 but even worse are the ones still waiting for the ‘pullback’ to $4,200. Tons of people had a chance to buy at $4,800 after the big jump in early April but they didn’t. Good luck to them.
@_date: 2019-05-08 15:28:40
Because the 'original' chain is still being mined and growing too--and accumulating it's own block rewards which the re-org chain will have to compensate for also. If you just have 51% hash power, there is no way you will catch up to the original chain and overtake it--not for a VERY VERY LONG TIME. As more time passes, the worse off you are trying to do a re-org. With 80% hash power, it is more plausible--or 75% (something in that range). It's not as simple as just get 51% and you can do whatever you want. That's just BS talk by people who don't really understand all the incentives built into bitcoin.

It was today's (May 10, 2019) episode of Unconfirmed with some guy named Tushar Jain from MultiCoin Capital. It's obvious to me that he's into 'investing' and knows NOTHING about the technicalities of POW or even how mining works. But he kept talking like he knew what he was talking about. So, if you are just an average person listening in, you would think he was an expert and that bitcoin transactions can be reversed by miners if you just ask them. He actually said all it would take is one phone call. Really sickening to listen to.

I don’t know how Tone’s going to live down that video where he rushes out of a dinner because he just HAS TO SHORT Bitcoin immediately. He shorted at $5280 and then it dropped to like $5150 and he was acting super smug. What a loser !! 
I’m sure he will promote himself as the guy who said that ‘bitcoin was going under $6,000’. Of course if you followed him and didn’t buy at $6,000 you’re STILL waiting to buy !!

@_date: 2019-05-09 07:52:52
It's not an absolute certainty--just human psychology. The idea is that a TON of people previously bought at the 6k level because they thought it was 'the bottom'. Once it went below that a lot of those people finally sold in 'capitulation' when it reached the real bottom of $3150. But not all. The idea is that many who held on will now finally sell at again at $6,000 so they can be 'even'. Those people are mostly just speculators and gamblers that count their net worth in USD instead of bitcoin. So the previous 'support' level now becomes the 'resistance' level. But nothing is certain so we will see what happens.

It’s not quite so simple. Those are pools made of individual miners. Those miners can switch pools if it becomes clear the pool might be carrying out a blockchain attack. This happened before with GHash.io. Such an attempted re-org will be publicly known and it takes time to do—even with 80% hashing power.

@_date: 2019-05-22 01:19:49
Let me make this easier for you. A blockchain is a huge database kept on a lot of different computers. This system is very inefficient. You can have much faster and cheaper transactions if a big company like Visa or Google or Facebook decided to offer their own ‘coin’. How could bitcoin complete against this ‘Google coin’? Well in that case it means Google would control the coin—not you. That’s the key difference between all these other coins and bitcoin. No one controls bitcoin. BCH, BSV and almost all other ‘coins’ are controlled by a small group of people. It doesn’t make any sense that they even have a blockchain—they are not decentralized so they might as well just create a ‘company coin’ and in fact that’s what they are. Craig Wright controls BSV, Roger and Jihan control BCH. Who cares about faster cheaper transactions if you don’t control your own money and it can be taken away from you by the few individuals who ‘control’ that coin? That’s why those are called ‘shitcoins’ that are not even comparable to bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-17 23:18:05
You also need to hold the bitcoin you receive and NOT convert it to fiat !!
@_date: 2019-05-08 16:02:24
I don't know anything about anything any more. I read the original 'We are the New Wealthy Elite Gentlemen' thread and I thought that guy was INSANE. He talked about $10,000 BTC. I didn't think we would see that in 50 years--guess who is laughing now !! So, yeah, anything is possible.
@_date: 2018-12-24 00:29:58
In that case there are really 2 options:
1. The person DOES NOT really understand bitcoin despite 'knowing a lot' about it. I would guess this is where a vast majority of people who reject bitcoin but claim to 'know a lot' about it fall.
2. They understand exactly what bitcoin is but reject it because they fundamentally disagree with many of the main principles behind it. These are mostly Keynesians who believe that government needs to control the money supply so that it can 'stimulate' the economy. They believe that spending is that what drives growth in the economy. Many of the 'leaders' of r/buttcoin fall in this category.

This will be an interesting comment to read around mid-November. I have a feeling that when the 2X hardfork occurs there will be a minority who will remain on the 1MB chain with even less than 5% hashpower, but they will insist that it is NOT an altcoin. Should be fun to watch.

Can you briefly explain why native segwit bc1 addresses are inherently more secure than the old p2pkh  that start with 1?
@_date: 2019-05-12 02:28:01
Sure. I can’t wait till all the ‘finance’ types start playing the same games they do with fiat with bitcoins. I want to see which central bank will come bail them out. The simple fact is that you can only play the fractional reserve game when you have a lender of last resort. If you do that in bitcoin and you guess wrong you will have to pay a FORTUNE to get more bitcoins to cover your wrong bets. ALL the big banks and major financial institutions would have been finished in 2008 if it hadn’t been for the fed. ALL OF THEM.

Not only that but miners also have a lot of investment in equipment that they hope to keep for a while. What's the point of doing something like this (an attack on the blockchain) to get 7,000 BTC if such an action would destroy the core value proposition of bitcoin. Frankly 7,000 BTC is way TOO LOW an amount to try something like this. Even when Bitfinex lost 120,000 BTC this wasn't even considered. Maybe they considered it but they were smarter about realizing it would NOT work--and that was in 2016 !!
Amazing how Satoshi got all the incentives for bitcoin so well aligned.

Read the details of the ‘big’ porting hacks. They were all inside jobs. Those people had passphrases with ATT that the hacker did not provide and yet their SIM  was ported. They also had a note saying no porting allowed—because the victim had already had his SIM ported once before. Again it made ZERO difference and his SIM was still ported a second time. Better option is don’t use a mobile # for any kind of ‘text code’ 2FA.

It's obvious. How the hell did 'hackers' get access to a ton of individual accounts' 2FA codes? You mean every single one of those account holders had poor opsec.

You would have a more compelling argument if the increase were to something more than 2MB in the non-witness size. I don't want to get into a bunch of technical details, but it's clear to the vast majority of people that a 2MB increase in the non-witness data size is quite manageable and safe.

Basically it's a super easy way to do Coinjoin transactions so you get to shuffle your coins WITHOUT any risk of theft since your coins are not sent off until you are guaranteed to get the same amount of coins back. It uses multisig transactions. Super low fees and NO CHANCE of being scammed. 
As far as mixers go, they are ALL SCAMS. The only good one was Bitmixer.io and that shut down years ago. Besides mixers are not as good as coinjoin since it's pretty clear that the mixing algorithms have been cracked and are traceable.

@_date: 2018-12-14 16:37:05
Not to get into personal name-calling but what I think they mean by 'scammer' is that when Bitcoin.com first released a wallet and started selling bitcoins, they had a huge button that said 'Buy Bitcoin' and if you clicked on that they sent you 'Bitcoin Cash'. Really. So that was a scam.
It was only after a huge uproar that they changed it to 'Buy Bitcoin Cash' and 'Buy Bitcoin Core'. Even this is a scam because there is no such thing as 'Bitcoin Core'--it's just bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-08 08:49:19
They're not splitting anything. It would just be a matter of mining a transaction. And then mining more blocks on top of this alternate chain to 'catch up' to the original chain. Basically it's just a 51% attack--but you need about 80% hash power not just 51%.
@_date: 2019-05-07 19:53:31
Not overnight--but very quick. Yeah...I can believe that. I remember when it hit $1,000 in early 2017, I thought it would take about 2 years before it went to 2,000. So you never know. But, it could also hit $50,000 and then drop to $8,000 or so. Then you will hear all the talk of bitcoin DYING again !!
@_date: 2019-05-08 12:18:54
No. It’s not that simple. If you have 51% vs 49% you will not really ‘catch up’ to the other chain since it continues to grow too. And your miners have to go back and reverse the theft transaction which was X blocks behind. The longer you wait the more X becomes and the longer the other chain grows too. As the normal chain grows so do the block rewards on it so your financial incentive of 7000 BTC becomes less and less valuable. 
It’s a theoretical idea but not a very practical one—at least not for 7,000 BTC. also not easy to coordinate 80% of miners.
@_date: 2019-05-11 19:40:25

Tone has been a LOSER for the past 4 years. He got lucky that BTC tanked in Nov. 2018 but that alone is worthless. You have to both call for lower prices AND know when to buy again. His 'followers', if there are any left, will be buying BTC at over $10k. I keep laughing when he was so happy he shorted BTC at $5,300 !! Yeah...that turned out well.
@_date: 2018-12-24 06:25:45
Your statement sounds simplistic but it is, in fact, the truth. Bitcoin right now is on a speculative phase and it will be a long time before it can truly become a store of value. 
However, of all the 'cryptocurrencies' bitcoin is the only one that has a shot at truly becoming a store of value because its core fundamentals cannot be easily altered since it has no 'leadership'.

Thanks for stating the obvious to anyone with the slightest sense of logic. It's crazy seeing all these cheerleading posts for such a destructive idea like BIP148 and watching them mostly go unchallenged. I can't believe these people STILL don't understand the importance of hashpower in Bitcoin. If any group of psychos can get together with essentially zero hashpower and force a change on the ecosystem then there is something really broken in bitcoin.

You're buying into propaganda. Just because you see a lot of posts praising UASF and calling it 'liberation' it doesn't mean that's the reality. Don't believe me--go read the thread about the Core developers discussing UASF. They actually called it crazy and reckless. 
Anybody who knows about bitcoin can see that. The UASF people see it too--they are just taking a huge gamble by threatening a chain split and thinking that's going to make miners activate segwit. It won't work and it's insane. 
Segwit2x is the only realistic way of activating segwit. Go read about Segwit2x. UASF is ridiculous fantasy. I like segwit and I think it will help bitcoin. I want it to be activated. UASF won't get it activated--it will just cause a chain split and create confusion among regular people. That's what will lead to the price drop--not the UASF by itself since those people will be isolated in their own ridiculous chain but the confusion it will create.

Ha. Sorry dude. Not a noob. And no, I wouldn’t be surprised if BTC is even at $1,000 again. It’s just that i think it’s BS if people think they can predict that based on drawing lines on price charts. They may get lucky a few times but it’s totally meaningless analysis.

The fact that almost everyone is hoping this is a 'bull trap' makes it less likely that it will be so. In all previous 'bull traps' the vast majority of people felt the 'bottom' had been reached. Now no one believes this, so it is more likely that it was 'the bottom'. But, only time will tell.

I agree with you about the fact that a few, loud crazies are about to cause a lot of confusion by causing a chain split. However, I have learned over the years to never underestimate bitcoin. I remember sitting there a couple of years back and watching the price plummet to $180 on MASSIVE volume that has not been seen since and thinking to myself, wow it's actually going to go below $100. Look now. 
The UASF people are loud and they have tweets and hats, but at the end of the day none of that will make a difference. Only hashpower makes a difference and they have essentially none.

No. There is NO NEED for any software change. It would just be a matter for him to make an alternate transaction and then convincing miners to include it in a block and then mine enough blocks on top of that alternate chain to 'catch up' to the current chain. It's basically just a 51% attack EXCEPT he would need way more than 51% of miners in order to carry it out. More like over 80% of miners, which he can't get.

They are confusing signaling for segwit with supporting UASF. Bitfury and BTCC signed on to Segwit2x. So, yes they support segwit but they DON'T support UASF and will not mine a UASF chain. F2pool is only signaling segwit because they were DDos attacked, so I doubt they will mine a UASF chain. 
There will be almost zero hashpower on the UASF chain. All that will happen Aug. 1 is that the UASF nodes will fork themselves off the bitcoin network when they cause a chain split. That's all. Segwit will NOT be activated by UASF. That's a fact. 
I say this as a segwit supporter too.

He's using the term re-org to describe a 51% attack--except that in this case, he would need SUBSTANTIALLY more than 51% to even attempt it. Probably would need over 80% hashing power to coordinate on this. 
If anyone can get 80% of bitcoin hash power to coordinate on such an attack, then bitcoin as we know it is finished. What would survive would no longer be bitcoin.

BIP148 is a desperate attempt by a few users with no hashpower to try to show that they can have influence over bitcoin. It's sad to watch people with their hats and their reddit posts and twitter posts thinking that makes a difference. The only thing that matters in bitcoin is hashpower--and they have almost none. 
They will succeed in causing a chain split and forking themselves off the main bitcoin network--that's all. By calling them a threat or a danger you massively overestimate their influence. They are loud here and on twitter but in the real world they constitute less than 1% of bitcoin users. The whole thing is a joke frankly.

In a long enough bitcoin time frame all bear markets are bear traps. People forget that for bitcoin it is possible for it to be in a 'bubble' and be undervalued at the same time. That's what happened when it went from $3 to $32 and back to $3 again in 2011--it was CLEARLY a bubble then. But it was still undervalued at $32. It's the SAME THING that happened again in 2017 when it went from $1,000 to $19,000. Yes, it was a bubble. But bitcoin was still undervalued at $19,000 !!!

I remember the whole Ghash.io episode. However, the difference here is that Ghash was just a mining pool whereas Bitmain was both a mining pool AND a key manufacturer of mining hardware. 
I am honestly shocked at how quickly Bitmain has unraveled. This was not just some small fly-by-night company. This was a MAJOR and powerful corporation and the majority of its demise can be traced to Jihan's moronic involvement in politics. 
I remember thinking this will not end well when Jihan tweeted how Andrew Stone had flown to China and had given him some book about Martin Luther and Jihan basically said how he came to realize how one man can make a huge difference. At that point I knew he was delusional but even I could not have predicted how quickly his whole company would unravel. It's truly astonishing to watch.

I want segwit, but I have not lost my mind to try this UASF without any hashpower. You guys are reckless. Even when BU had over 50% hashpower they did not try to fork. Many UASF supporters were criticizing BU for wanting to fork at 75% and now they are advocating a chain split at ZERO hashpower. This is a crazy world.
BTW, I was NOT a BU supporter (and I am not one now). However, in retrospect, they were a lot more responsible than the UASF people.

Off chain solutions are NOT HERE YET. If onchain fees continue to rise before offchain solutions are ready and deployed, you're going to see almost every single business that accepts Bitcoin start to accept alternative cryptocurrencies directly. The first thing will be that Bitpay will add other cryptos and list their fees along with Bitcoin. Do you want to pay a $3 fee (or $20) with Bitcoin or pay 50 cents another crypto to purchase this item?
This will negatively impact Bitcoin in a massive scale.

Quite the opposite. Even at 80% hashrate it would probably take a week to re-.org the chain. That’s even enough time for someone to release a UASF-type change to the full mode software to reject that chain. Again these things are not certain but what I can say with certainty is that if anyone thinks that by just having 80% of the hashrate they can re-org the chain without any opposition then they are out of their minds. It’s not just a simple hashrate calculation.
@_date: 2017-06-09 20:31:18
I have no doubt it will happen--it will cause a chain split and you guys will be forked off the network in less than one day. I can guarantee you it will NOT result in segwit activating--not unless you can get a lot more hashpower. You don't need more cute hats or reddit posts mind you--you need hashpower. That's the key.
@_date: 2017-06-09 15:17:02
What you are asking is a very good question. It is NOT explained well. The answer is that NO, you cannot add a 25th anything. The 24 word seed is the 24 word seed. When you setup a wallet using your 24 word seed, you will get a certain address and other addresses will be derived from that address. 
HOWEVER, you can now add an extra word (any word you want) as a passphrase. This will generate a whole other address with a whole different derivation. This address will be 'hidden' when you login using your 'normal' pin. But, if you associate this word with a 'permanent' pin, then you will have 2 wallets. The first will come up if you use your 'normal' pin. The second will come up if you enter this alternate pin--that second wallet will be generated from the 24 word seed PLUS the extra passphrase you chose. 
Hope that helps. The idea of the 'temporary passphrase is that you can have as many of these wallets associated with passphrases as you want--it's just that only one can be attached to an alternate pin. To access the others you use the 'temporary passphrase' feature and you actually have to type in the passphrase everytime you want to use one of those wallets. So, you login with your normal pin and then you go into the passphrase section and setup an alternate wallet using this extra temporary passphrase. 
It's kind of confusing until you try it yourself a few times. Make sure you can recreate and access these wallets before you send any bitcoins to them.

I’m not attacking you. Can you answer this question? What makes bitcoin different from EVERY SINGLE other shitcoin out there—yes, I am including ETH, BCH, and everything else in that category. If you can’t answer it or you don’t think there’s a REAL difference then you don’t understand what you own and you should sell. If you understand what you have you would know that selling your bitcoins fior $7,000 worth of USD each is more than stupid. You will see that there will be plenty of people wanting to buy them from you. These people want to trade their debt-based fiat currency for something that has REAL value. Good luck.

Signaling UASF won't make a difference--you mean install the UASF software patch to actually reject non-segwit signaling blocks after Aug. 1. If you do this and you don't know what you are doing and you make transactions after Aug. 1 you will likely lose your bitcoins. Be very very careful. To suggest that every bitcoin user do this is insane.
If you do this, be aware that with almost no hashpower you will just fork yourself off the main bitcoin network. Don't be deluded into believing otherwise.

@_date: 2019-05-08 14:52:18
Exactly. For something like this to even have a chance of working you would need around 80% of hash power. Now if you have 80% hash power you have 2 choices:
- continue to mine bitcoin normally and gain 80% of the block rewards
- Try to do a re-org so you can try to get some of the 7,000 BTC 'reward'. 
If you pick the second option then you also massively destroy the value of bitcoin and your 7,000 BTC are worthless. Also all your mining equipment investment becomes essentially worthless. Easy choice.
Satoshi designed bitcoin with EXCELLENT incentives !!

The only positive thing to come from it is that I am hoping to once again pickup some sub $1,000 bitcoins--the real bitcoins, not the BIP148 crap coins. 
No one supporting BIP148 will answer any of your concerns because they have no answers for them other than to say they will WIN.

You are correct. Last summer there were scattered posts of people saying their Binance accounts were hacked even though they had 2FA on. Everyone dismissed them as being stupid and having fallen to malware. However, I remember one of the guys was very technical and he insisted he did not fall victim to any phishing attacks.
It's obvious now that Binance itself was hacked and the hacker was using those few random accounts to 'test' their hack. Had Binance taken those reports seriously and investigated they have discovered that their systems were infiltrated. Instead they blamed the individual users and said that Binance was not responsible.

Nah. He's talking about a coordinated 51% attack to rewrite the blockchain. Except he would need way more than 51% for it to succeed--likely he would need closer to 80% of the hash power to mine another chain in order to 'overtake' the original chain. This completely delusional. 
In fact, if he could get 80% of miners to agree on such a coordinated attack then bitcoin would basically cease to exist. He can't get it though because miners have way more to gain from the real bitcoin than a measly 7,000 BTC that he would offer. But it doesn't even work because the hacker now has incentive to pay the miners too--as we saw happen in ETH. 
TLDR: CZ is delusional in addition to being a scammer.
@_date: 2017-06-17 08:15:35
Most people, and I include myself among them, don't really believe in conspiracy theories. I think what concerns a LOT of of people is the sudden rise in bitcoin fees--now averaging over $3 and in many cases a lot more.  These kinds of fees make bitcoin impractical to use for any amount less than $300. Don't you think this will harm bitcoin? I think it will. 
The biggest harm will come if these fees are not only seen as 'normal' but they are even encouraged by some people. This is kind of crazy. If you believe that fees these high will harm bitcoin, then it's important to try to push for a solution that will do something about high fees NOW. 
I agree with segwit but any rational person will tell you that it will NOT have an immediate impact on fees. Lightning network will, but that' won't be ready for widescale use for AT LEAST 1 year--if even. I think that's why you see a lot of this frustration coming from.
That's why personally I stongly support Segwit2x.

Honestly I think people have become too jaded. The miner activation soft work system will probably work out fine for subsequent upgrades.

No you don't. You have one key--Coinbase has the other. To move the funds requires both keys. There is a tool you can use to 'recover' Coinbase's key, but that's not a simple thing to do if you are new at this. Do you now how to recover Coinbase's key and move those bitcoins completely on your own? I would guess not. Then you don't control those bitcoins so they are not yours.
Bitcoins are not 'in front of you' in the Trezor or in the Coinbase server--bitcoins are on the block chain. What's stored in the Coinbase servers is their private key.
@_date: 2017-06-12 05:54:44
That would be insane. DO NOT do that. If someone finds it all they have to do is poke a hole in it and they have access to your keys. It's not meant to be a wallet for cold storage.

A 2MB hardfork is a small price for me to pay in order to get segwit activated and keep the community united and move bitcoin forward. Being so intransigent about a 2MB hardfork will definitely lead to a chain split that's being caused by the UASF people. I don't see any realistic path to avoid a chain split at this point except for segwit2x.
@_date: 2017-06-08 09:40:43
I think it's clear we will be moving toward 2 bitcoins--each one with segwit but one with 1MB non-witness block size and the other initially with 2MB and soon thereafter with 4-8 MB non-witness block size. The UASF movement is accelerating this by openly advocating for a chain split. Oh well.
@_date: 2019-05-08 08:35:23
Yeah...what a moron. I can already hear all the crap altcoin people interpreting his stupid comment as 'see bitcoin can be rolled back too' !! It's not permanent. Bitcoin is just like [insert crap shitcoin here] in that regard and we have FASTER blocks !!
No amount of explanation about how mining works will dissuade those fools of this belief now. Two years from now we will still be hearing about how CZ could have rolled back bitcoin but he decided not to. All this BS thanks to CZ opening his big mouth about something he didn't even understand.

This is bullshit thinking. If you think this is true then go ahead and try it. It's so simple right. Just sell when it's high and buy when it's low. So easy.
The fact is that a TON of people who sold at $15-20k have NOT bought back in and likely they will buy back again only when it's over $25k.
@_date: 2019-05-07 19:50:52

You need 51% hashing power to do a 51% attack--ie. to try to change the block at the tip of the chain. That's what a 'classic' 51% attack is. 
In order to go back in time and change transactions in previously mined blocks you will DEFINITELY need way more than 51% of the hashing power--and you will need that for a sustained amount of time. 
Doing a 51% attack and changing previously confirmed transactions are two completely different scenarios.

I agree. I think this whole idea that a vocal minority wearing hats can somehow coerce a change in bitcoin when they have almost no hashpower needs to be finally put to rest. 
Go ahead and try. Once you fail it will become very obvious why bitcoin depends on POW and not on POH (proof of hats).

This topic has been discussed ad naseum. Many threads each of which is many pages long. Bottom line is that anyone who’s done any serious research on this can tell you Satoshi was NOT Hal—for many reasons. Everyone who is serious about bitcoin eventually undertakes their own deep dive into this subject. Personally I don’t know who Satoshi is, but I can tell you with 100% certainty it’s NOT Wright—or Kleiman. Wright is a scammer.

They can’t do that. That’s the heart of bitcoin. You need a private key to change the transaction. It’s one thing for a miner to re-play a signed transaction. It’s a whole other thing to change that transaction. They don’t have the private key of the person who sent the transaction.
@_date: 2017-06-10 02:49:25

Your comment would be correct if you ASSUME someone knows how to SECURELY encrypt the passphrase offline on a clean computer and then securely upload it to the cloud. However, such a person would also know how to SECURELY use a software bitcoin wallet and may not really need a hardware wallet.
The point of hardware wallets is that someone that is NOT sophisticated can make a secure wallet without having to know how to start with a clean Linux boot CD on a computer that is not connected to the internet. For this person, it is much safer to write the seed words on a piece of paper since that means that AT LEAST they won't get electronically hacked. If they try to encrypt the seed words then they will likely do it in an unsecure manner and will be hacked.

I guess I am confused. It would make more sense for me to 'see' the segwit 'discount' if the weight were LESS for the non-witness part of segwit. 
So, 1 byte of witness in segwit = 1 weight and 1 byte of non-witness in segwit = 0.25 weight.

It was CLEARLY in a bubble even at that time. 
I think what you want to say is that something can be in a bubble and still be undervalued overall. After all, bitcoin was in a bubble when it went from $2 to $33 and then crashed to $2 again--but the $33 price was undervalued. But still, a bubble !!!

The chain split will occur when the BIP148 chain splits off and only has less than 5% hashpower. There will be no need for a bitmain fork then since BIP148 will be essentially dead. 
I say essentially because I am convinced that the people pushing for BIP148 will keep it alive for ever--but it won't matter. Don't let reddit posts, and tweets and cute hats fool you. BIP148 is a ridiculous attempt by an insignificant minority to force their will on bitcoin. Not gonna happen.

As far as bitcoin cash goes yes. The actual sub was for a Canadian comedy tv show. It was taken over purchased under the table by Roger Ver and used for Bitcoin Cash postings. But the actual BCH fork didn’t happen till Aug. 2017 but that sub was pushing for it since April 2017. The main creator of the Bitcoin Cash fork was Bitmain. Without the support of Bitmain mining BCH at a loss BCH would have never survived. At this time last year Bitmain was one of the biggest, richest companies in the world. It was seeking an IPO rumores to be in the 40 billion USD range. After supporting BCH it almost went bankrupt.
@_date: 2019-05-08 16:50:34
No because in theory the value of bitcoin should continue to grow. So then you are talking about destroying the intrinsic value of bitcoin for a reward in BTC that will be worth much less because you have just destroyed it's value. It's really against the interest of miners to do things that hurt bitcoin since they have so much money invested in their mining equipment. If you have 80% hash power, it's in your interest to just continue mining bitcoin rather than try to attack it by doing a re-org since the attack itself will destroy its value. 
The only possible scenario would be someone who just wanted to attack bitcoin for it's own sake--possible, but then they have to spend a TON of money getting the required hash power. So, it's not a cheap thing to do.
Bitcoin does have a good balance of incentives.
@_date: 2019-05-08 13:35:14

Bitcoin will be taken seriously by all once it hits about $50,000--and maybe not until it's $100,000. It's definitely way too early.
I am reminded of Hillary Clinton when she was in Arkansas in 1975 or so and thought she had missed out on Walmart stock because between the time she first wanted to buy it and when she was finally ready to buy it, the price increased from like $3.50 to $4.25 so she never bought it because she 'missed the boat' on it.

@_date: 2019-05-08 12:26:42
And the longer it takes the more the block rewards accumulate in the other chain so less incentive for miners to mine your alternate chain. Also the attacker can make transactions that also bribe miners so it makes your rewards even less valuable. This is exactly what the ethereum attacker did and it’s why they had to hard fork to a new chain.
@_date: 2017-06-04 13:53:28

It would be even better if they increased it's memory storage capacity. As it is now, once you add 2 altcoin wallets, you then have to erase one in order to add another.

Nah. If bitcoin has the same price as gold in terms of store of value it would give each bitcoin a price of $400,000.

I support segwit. UASF, however, is a misguided attempt by a minority to force a change that will end only in forking themselves off the network. 
It will NOT result in the activation of segwit. An extremely small (though very loud) minority of users with essentially zero hashpower CANNOT force a change onto the bitcoin network. 
@_date: 2017-06-10 16:48:07
Do NOT under any circumstance do anything related to BIP148 or the UASF. There is a lot of talk here about this being 'freedom' and other BS like that. Don't believe any of that hype. 
It's actually a very dangerous chain split being advocated by an incredibly tiny minority of users. It will result in a chain split and they will fork themselves off the bitcoin network. Hopefully the whole thing will be over with quickly since they have almost ZERO hashpower--which is the only thing that matters in bitcoin. Cute hats, twitter and reddit posts DON'T MATTER.
@_date: 2017-06-09 18:16:52
This is a good question that's not well understood by many people. Your bitcoin are NOT on the Trezor (or the Ledger). The bitcoins are actually on the blockchain--a copy of which is stored on many computers around the world. The bitcoins are secured by math--elliptical curve cryptography. It's not the Trezor that gives them 'security'. 
The Trezor only holds the private keys needed to move those bitcoins. The word seed you are given when you setup the Trezor is the private key (basically). As long as you have that word list and as long as there are computers that have a copy of the blockchain anywhere in the world, your bitcoins are safe. 
If Trezor goes out of business, you can use a Ledger to recover them. If Ledger goes out of business you can use a software wallet like Mycelium or others. If all those go out of business, you can use software tools to get the private keys to each address that has your bitcoins in it. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 08:37:29
If activating segwit and ending this destructive debate is capitulation, then I don't see how you would define success. Look what's happening with ETH. It's not fake--it's real. The longer this debate goes on, the more bitcoin loses. If you can't see that, then I don't know how to make it clearer.

No way this can happen. You would really need about 80% of the hash power for this to even work. The longer you wait the worse it becomes since the normal chain would be growing too. Also, there is systemic risk to bitcoin. If you are a miner, do you risk all your hardware and the value of all of BTC just to 'help out' an exchange. Even if you are being bribed it may not be worth it just because of the damage this would do to BTC. A deliberate re-org is nothing more than a 51% attack--except you need a LOT more than 51% hash power.
@_date: 2018-12-30 18:03:48
It’s no longer the case that every transaction has a separate fee. Segwit allows batching so you can send many transactions together with one fee. Of course the fee still depends on transaction size—not amount.

NO...you wouldn't be 'punishing' the thief. You would be punishing the entire bitcoin blockchain. If you are a miner that has 80% hash power and you are doing this then you are an idiot because by the time it is done the 7,000 BTC that you may get are worth almost nothing. Also, you have just made all your hardware investment worthless too. It's an easy choice. It would be much better to use your 80% hash power to continue mining the original chain and keep 80% of the block rewards.

Ok..fair enough..it's my prediction. But, it's based on more than just 'feelings'. It's based on the fact that in bitcoin hashrate matters for a reason. Understanding this is key to knowing why BU didn't attempt a hardfork when they had more than 50% hashpower at one point. They were actually responsible and understood the risk involved in a contentious hard fork. 
So, I totally don't get why so many people who should know better are cheering this insane BIP148 effort by a tiny minority of people with near zero hashpower. BIP148 is GUARANTEED to accomplish only ONE THING--cause a chain split. That's all it will do. 
I know that people have a right to do whatever they want, but I would like to see a lot more people calling out this movement for the insanity that it is advocating. Oh well. Interesting times ahead.

The thing that has surprised me the most about this entire affair has been the utter destruction of Bitmain. 
Looking back 2 years ago, Bitmain seemed like it was an all-powerful entity that could potentially pose a tremendous threat to bitcoin because of their control over mining and mining hardware. Yet now it is dramatically reduced in scope and power--I would have never believed it could happen so quickly.
And all this because Jihan decided that instead of continuing to work as a miner (what made him super rich) he wanted to try his hand at politics. He listened to Roger and came to believe that he could be an 'influencer' and that he needed to be more 'involved' and was talked into being an 'agent of change'. Well look where that got him and look where it got Bitmain. 
It's been just incredible to watch and I must say I never would have predicted it could happen so quickly !!

I want segwit though I don't agree with BIP148. Still you have to admit that segwit will have very little immediate impact on fees. LN will reduce fees but it will be 1 year at least before that comes into common use. Even an increase in the nonwitness block size is at least 6 months away.

It's the same with ETH as it is with bitcoin. ETH just uses a different derivation path--but it uses the same seed words.

It's an OLD classic--bookmark it because this same issue will come up AGAIN and AGAIN. It's a never-ending cycle. I can't wait for the one where bitcoin crashes from $200,000 to $30,000 !!! It will DEFINITELY be dead then !!
@_date: 2017-06-09 18:45:08
BIP148 will result in the small number of people who run it self-forking from the bitcoin network. That's all. It won't lead to the activation of anything with the near-zero hashrate they will have. That's just a fact.

I don't recommend them. There are old threads that you can find about Jaxx storing the private key in plain text and I have read reports of people running Exodus getting hacked but I don't have experience with those wallets personally. 
BRD is the best right now. Samurai wallet will be good, but it's really not ready for release yet--there are still bugs in it.

If that's the case, then their security is complete shit. And to think that when individual customers were hacked and had their 2FA turned off by hackers, Binance told them to go screw themselves. 
Binance said they were not responsible--but they never explained how the 2FA could have been turned off. This happened last year and Binance just brushed it off. Like I said, scammers.

Your 2% mining estimate is way too low. But, forget about the miners--I wish you luck in convincing even 5% of users to actually run a node with BIP148 implementation. You will be lucky if you have 1% of users. 
Like I said, the whole movement reeks of sad desperation by people who should know better how bitcoin actually works. It will fail miserably--but it will first cause a chain split and you guys will be forked off the network. 
@_date: 2019-05-08 13:31:36
Exactly. They already understand it and are comfortable with it. Maybe central bankers 50 years from now, if they still exist, will be comfortable with bitcoin as gold. I doubt it though because bitcoin would remove their power. As they say, it’s hard for a someone  to understand something that’s against their interests.
@_date: 2017-06-05 17:34:43
I completely agree with you. Even a hard fork that increases nonwitness data to 2 mb won't make a difference for at least 6 months--if that even goes through. In the meantime Bitcoin is being priced out of many common uses--to the benefit of alts. It really doesn't make sense to send any Bitcoin transaction that not at least $100--I would even argue at least $200.  It's a serious situation that has no quick fix. Sad to see.

Of course, your thinking could also be backwards. 
People want to hodle it precicely because they think it has value. The more people feel it has value, the more people will want it. The more people want it, the more its value will go up--because of its limited supply. 
The more the value goes up, the more people will want it. 
The more people want it, the more likely it will be for other people to want to accept it for goods and services--because they want to get bitcoin. And this time those same businesses will actually want to keep it and not just convert it to fiat immediately--again, because they view it as having value. 
So, basically, everything starts with people who hodle it because they believe it has value. :)

UASF is irresponsible to try without significant miner and clear economic majority support. None of these exist now. It's just a bunch of fanatics turning on their personal nodes and with almost ZERO hashpower backing them. 
This is what I and many other people have been saying so often on threads that are overwhelmingly pro-UASF where most commenters supporting UASF don't even understand (or at least don't care to understand) these risks. 
Like I said many times before, I'm hoping to pick up some sub $1,000 bitcoins in this ordeal.

It's worse than not being well informed. He doesn't even understand the basics of bitcoin or POW. I can already hear all the crap altcoin people interpreting his stupid comment as 'see bitcoin can be rolled back too' !! It's not permanent. Bitcoin is just like [insert crap shitcoin here] in that regard and we have FASTER blocks !!
In fact, Laura Shin had another MORON on her podcast today saying how all blocks in bitcoin except for the Genesis block can be reversed by a re-org !! I am NOT KIDDING. It's insane the lack of knowledge out there.
No amount of explanation about how mining works will dissuade those fools of this belief now. Two years from now we will still be hearing about how CZ could have rolled back bitcoin but he decided not to. All this BS thanks to CZ opening his big mouth about something he didn't even understand.

There is already a massive lawsuit against ATT by a guy that lost $24 million through the EXACT same scenario. ATT just doesn’t give a shit. I don’t know about OP but this other guy had a passphrase on his ATT account and the ATT rep still ported the account even though the hacker couldn’t provide the passphrase. Similar stories exist with Verizon and Sprint. All phone companies are pure shit in regards to having security measures against SIM porting.

Your idea is very insecure because of the 'random' part--humans are not good at creating true randomness. 
Also, you have it backwards. Modern wallets do not give you 24 'random' words. They generate a very large random number and that number is then represented as 24 words. It's not just picking 24 words from a word list.
@_date: 2019-05-11 19:44:39
Every coin listed below bitcoin is pure shit—with many actually being sub-shit. Maybe with Monero being the exception.

That agreement was doomed the minute it was signed. If anyone remembers not one day had passed when a big deal was made by miners that Adam Back signed it as 'Individual' and they objected to this because they thought he was there representing Blockstream. The next day he re-signed it and added the title of "President of Blockstream". 
This was a strange occurrence and it didn't portend well for that agreement. It's clear that the miners thought they were dealing with Core and Blockstream--even though officially they were not.

I hope you realize that activating segwit will NOT have a significant effect on fees in the short term. It will take at least 6 months for people to start making segwit transactions and even then it will not have much of an effect on fees. Increasing the non-witness blocksize would have an immediate effect for legacy transactions but that won't happen for at least another 6 months (if even). 
The only thing that will actually decrease fees would be the use of layer-2 solutions like Lightning, but that won't be realistically ready for at least another year. 
So, even if segwit activates in August and even if the non-witness blocksize is increased, fees will continue at these levels, if not higher. 
I worry about what will happen to the use of bitcoin in the next 6 months to 1 year if fees continue to be this high. Many transactions are becoming impractical to make. You could say it makes no sense to use bitcoin for anything less than $100.

They are trustworthy? You don't even know where they are located. You don't even know who the top people running the exchange are. CZ himself lives in hotels and has no permanent address. All of Binance could disappear tomorrow and there is no place to go to for any kind of legal recourse. Binance was the king of the scam ICO craze and now they are coming up with scam 'blockchains'. 
Binance is a MASSIVE business that is completely run by anonymous people and you call that 'trustworthy'. So were Mt. Gox and Bitfinex and BTC-e 'trustworthy'--up to a point. 
One day, hopefully soon, Binance will fall too. It will be better for the entire ecosystem to get rid of scam places like that.
