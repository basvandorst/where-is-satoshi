That's Dorian Nakamoto. Back in 2013-2014 reporters started harassing him because they thought he was the real Satoshi, due to his background and having lived a few blocks away from Hal Finney many years ago. Poor guy was just a retiree who loves trains. I believe he even did an AMA on here, and people even donated Bitcoins to him. It's one of the few instances in which "the real Nakamoto" logged into a forum he hadn't used in years to confirm that Dorian wasn't the actual Nakamoto, so that reporters would leave him alone. Though some say that Nakamoto's username might have been compromised.

Blockchain.com is the biggest one. Though I've moved my Bitcoins to cold storage, I stored Bitcoins with them from 2013 to 2017 and had absolutely no problems. The only thing you have to worry about is setting 2 factor authentication. Also, never click on a google ad for blockchain.

This thing you're referring to has actually been here a lot more in the past than recently. I used to hear horror stories of how hits were taken out on people on the deep web using Bitcoins.

Try  disclaimer that bitcoin.com is owned by Roger Ver, it's a propaganda site for BCash, but for actually buying Bitcoins is completely safe. Chances are also your card will be declined the first time. You'll need to call your bank ASAP, no matter what hour and verify that it was you. It also charges premium fees. Expect to get 7.5% fee off the top, compared to Coinbase's 4% fee, also the exchange rate adds a 1%-2% premium.

Did this just recently happened? There is a high chance that your card is currently frozen by your bank. This is normal with your first Crypto purchase, most banks automatically flag it as a fraudulent activity. Call your bank ASAP. Every, even small credit unions, have a security team on-call 24/7. Choose the debit card options on their menu- you'll probably have to enter your card number through keypad etc.. They'll ask you to verify some information regarding your account, and then they'll ask you to verify whether the transactions on Coinbase your yours. After that your card should work.

At worst use the  wallet. That's where I stored my coins from 2013 up until the middle of this year before moving to a hardware wallet. That website has been shown to be relatively reliable, and the owner is well known in the Bitcoin community. Coinbase is the absolute worst place to store your coins. If they freeze your account for any reason, you part ways with your coins for quite a while. Their support is notoriously terrible, so won't have an easy time getting your coins back. Also, you don't own the private keys to your wallet. Whenever there is a fork, technically Coinbase owns those. This is why people have still not received their Bitcoin Cash from BTCs that were stored on Coinbase, though they promise to release them in 2018. Yesterday's pump would've been a great day to dump those.

Hello Jesse. I was being facetious in that comment. Though rest assured that since there is a recorded transaction, the original sender can't just cancel it- Bitcoin transactions are not reversible. The network is just congested at the moment and it'll take time to confirm in the transaction. Presumably it was sent with very low fee (to the miners), which is why it's taking long. There is already one confirmation of the transaction which is a good thing- i.e. one pool has confirmed the transaction to be valid. Only 2 more confirmation to go, it'll get there.
Edit: I have submitted the transaction ID (577d801aa13dac692d6ad11c2db71ae9184eb626957bd981722adec05eb98fb5) to ( which should add one more confirmation. After about 5 minutes, I think it's been fully confirmed.

It's just general advice when announcing any kind of substantial money. The type of information on a "main profile" can lead them to your real identity, with some digging and social engineering can lead them to your phone service provider (i.e. taking over your phone), online accounts, all the way up to your bank account. It's usually best to have something like this on a throwaway. Even months after a post, you'll find random PMs lurking into your profile making it unusable to a certain extent. Your Bitcoins may be "safe" on a ledger, but everything else which comes with having this kind of money- i.e. bank, is at risk.

There are much better way of doing that than using one's ability to artificially manipulate the market to purposefully crash the original coin which most people into Bitcoins or cryptocurrencies in general have stakes in. He wasn't letting the market chose, but was basically trying to force things which people didn't obviously like. I'm sure that if the Bitcoin network congestion and high fees was organic, people would be looking into going to another coin like Bitcoin cash as a better alternative. Due to his actions, now they just have someone to pin those problems on.

I'm somewhat of a crypto newbie, though I've owned bitcoins since 2013. Help me understand this: Does coinbase only track coins that are present on their site? Or do they have some way of tracking coins that are transferred to external wallets? i.e. monitoring transfers from/to the address which you send your coins to?
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:28:00
Have you used your card anywhere else after this? Call your bank ASAP. Some bank's algorithm trigger bitcoin transactions as fraudulent activity on the card. There is a high chance that your card has been frozen by your bank. Call even if it's outside of your bank's normal operating hours, they'll have a security team on-call. They'll ask you a bunch of questions to verify your identity, and they'll also ask you to verify that the transactions were carried out by you. After that you should be able to buy Crypto again. Check your email, if the card has been removed from CoinBase, even after doing this, you'll unfortunately be unable to buy crypto with that card again. This is what happened to me about a week about, and their support told me that I'd have to use another card. But you never know.

Lmao, bought Bitcoin at today's all time high of $6,900 (oh, with Simplex's 7% fee). Less than $30 minute later, it started to dip and my transactions are still unconfirmed. I'm laughing maniacally right now for no reason. Thankfully it was only $80 worth of Bitcoin. Oh yeah, also the transaction has still not been confirmed so I can't move it to another alt-coin.

Oh sweet summer child. You'll never hear back from them using that form. Coinbase is notorious for their terrible support. Some people don't hear back until after 3 months of emailing them. The good news is that some of their team members are on reddit, one of which is  (reply to one of her most recent comments, and tell her that you've DM'd her). Briefly explain your problem and DM her things like your name and email address used on CoinBase, with some luck she'll get back to you via email (not DMs). 
Visit view some of the most recent threads. You will usually find a thread about how to recover your money. It may involve contacting some government agency, but hopefully it doesn't have to come to that. Also, pro-tip: be cordial in your email with support.

Wait, did they not unfreeze after you explained? Most banks have an algorithm which automatically triggers Bitcoin-related transactions as fraudulent. Usually once you call and clear up that these were your transactions, they unfreeze the account. I used to bank with a small credit union, and the same thing happened. After unfreezing I could continue buying BTC through exchanges.
This is actually a good thing! 
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:34:54
Woaw, really? I'm a complete newbie at this. Does that mean that cashing out my s2x coins, I will necessarily lose the equivalent value of Bitcoins I own? Or do you mean that we can run into the risk of losing our Bitcoin during a s2x transaction? i.e. there is a non-zero probability of losing BTCs, versus a 100% chance of losing BTC every time?! If it's the latter, why in God's name would anyone want to implement such a thing as s2x? Are they looking to completely replace BTC or something?

Call your bank ASAP. Same thing happened to me just 2 days ago. Most banks have security measures which flag your debit card directly after buying crypto. It's an automatic fraud prevention measure. There is a high chance that your card has been frozen, meaning you won't be able to use it for anything else. Just call your bank, and through the automated options choose "credit/debit card". They will transfer you to the security team, and ask you verification questions to confirm your identity. Then they will ask you to verify that the transactions which were made are indeed yours. After that they'll unlock it. You should in principal be able to buy cryptos there after.

Coinbase is the closest thing Bitcoin has to mass adaption and legitimacy. This is whether you like them or not. They have the most user-friendly interface for beginner- i.e. use of credit/debit cards, and most of the funds are FDIC ensured by the U.S. government. Coinbase would be 100x better if they spent a little more money on tech support. Their support is just unexcusably god darn awful. They should offshore it or something.
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:30:05
It's almost impossible. Bitcoins are not retractable, whereas Paypal is. What do you mean by your bank refusig to whitelist coinbase? Are you from the U.S.? It's your money, and it isn't illegal, so you should be able to do what you want with it. Threaten to leave, they'll probably change their demeanor. Another way to buy is through localbitcoins, use it with caution!
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:49:53
This better be good OP.
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:42:10
Yes.  is the easiest way that I have found so far for credit/debit card, with no sign up required. But their fees are relatively high. 7.5% fee up top, and their exchange rate of BTC/dollar is typically 1%-2% higher than the current market rate. So expect to get at around 10% less Bitcoins than elsewhere. On Coinbase I believe the fee is at around 4%. I don't know if they have other fees, or whether their exchange rate is a bit higher. You will need a Bitcoin wallet. blockchain.info is one of the most popular wallets out there. Be vary careful on clicking on Google ads for blockchain.info though, because many people have been tricked into giving their info to phising ads in the past. Bookmark blockchain.info and only access the site through a bookmark. Enable 2 Factor Authentication! This part is very important! They'll probably give you a seed or private key, save this in a very safe place also! Even if you're unable to access the blockchain site, using a private key or seed, you can use any Bitcoin wallet to recover your bitcoisn.
Note that bitcoin.com is owned by Roger Ver, the a**hole who's trying to have BCash take over Bitcoin. He's also the same guy falsely advertising that BCash is the actual Bitcoins. For this particular purchase, you don't have to worry about that, but be very weary of the website in the future- not because bitcoin.com is a scam, but because it's mostly a propaganda tool for its owner, who's one of the largest Bitcoin owners out there. The payment itself is handled by Simplex (who handles payments for sites like Coinmama, Challengly etc...) For the most part they don't ask for any verification, but there is a chance that they may ask you to verify your identity through ID/Passport before they can confirm your payment. It usually only happens once, and it took them less than 10 minutes to verify it the first time I submitted one. If your transaction gets denied for any reason, it was probably automatically flagged by your bank. Call your bank ASAP, irregardless of whether it's their normal working hours. If you pick the Debit Card option on their menu, they'll have a security team who'll ask you questions for verification purposes and ask you to verify your transactions, before unfreezing your card. After that it should work. That's what happened to me the first time.

At this point, Bitcoin is a currency. There isn't really an easy way to "earn it", other than if someone paid you in Bitcoins for work you did.  There used to be Bitcoin faucets a few years ago, and I think few still exist. But it's too much work for fractions of pennies. Even if Bitcoin grows beyond our wildest dreams they'll only be worth a few bucks, or 10s of dollars. The easiest way to get Bitcoins is to simply buy it. Even mining at this point isn't profitable for beginners. Bitcoin is 1 of thousands of cryptocurrencies. Somewhere out there there is a cryptocurrency that can produce as much profit between now and a few years, as Bitcoin did over the past 5-6 years. Look into alternative cryptocurrencies, but be very careful. Study up on them before investing.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:58:11
As suggested by others, Coinbase is the best place to buy Bitcoins for beginners. But it will require a credit card or debit card and bank account. I don't know if this is still the case, but Paypal used to ban for Bitcoin transactions and most merchants won't accept paypal because it's easy to reverse transactions, whereas Bitcoin transactions are irreversible. Also, $5 at this point is too low. The Bitcoin network is very congested right now and it's taking around $7 in fees to transfer coins between wallets (each time). Around $70 is the lowest most places will cell it for. buy.bitcoin.com is arguably the fastest way to buy, but their fees are 7% compared to coinbase's 4%, and their conversion rate (i.e. dollar per BTC) is slightly higher. The upside is that they only require your credit card, there is a slight chance that they will ask you to verify your identity using an ID/Passport/Driver's License etc... Also, you run into the risk of your credit card being automatically frozen, the first time. You will need to call your bank to clear up that the transaction was you before you can use your card for anything again.

This is how it was in the early days. Scammers make this model unsustainable. A trusted middle man solves that problem. Once acquired on the other hand, you don't need to rely on this middle man to transfer/receive the coins. Mining was another way of acquiring the coins, but it's become too valuable to be obtainable that way for the regular person.
