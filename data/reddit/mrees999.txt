It's been going for five years...and nobody cares.  It's just like bitcoin but with centralization. Oh and forgot to mention it requires permission and acts as surveillance on a closed network that hopes to compete with an open standard with a seven year head start for networking effect.

Pretty sure all ETFs can settle in cash. With Gold it is common belief that there are only one physical ounce for every 100 "paper" ounces people think they have based on contracts. Added together all the gold listed in contracts is about 100 times the amount known to exist.  They say if you dont hold gold, you don't own it. It is likely the same for bitcoin etf as well. Although blockchain proof can be given there may be legal grey areas where they get shuffled around so the ETFs can play the same kind of shell games.  In short - if don't hold the private keys, you don't own it.  You would most likely be sent a very quickly depreciating and unwanted currency for your settlement.

There is a bitcointalk forum about this subject and research into calculating how many bitcoins have been destroyed\lost and are unrecoverable. I believe they've accounted for around one million - gone. A huge portion of coins mined in the first year have never been moved, or spent. Its just speculation that they haven't been destroyed as well. They were worthless the first few years and people didn't bother backing up their computers that had mined them.  This makes it deflationary. We will never get to 21 million in 2140 because we know at least a million are already gone.

Napster was beginning of something great.  Except it was a centralized company that could be sued. And...bitcoin has no central anything - and good luck trying to sue it - if you are trying to draw comparisons.  
For a better comparison, use E-Gold. That was attempting to do what bitcoin is doing, but was centralized, and got sued.  
Since bitcoin is derived from bit-torrent technology - which was established because Napster was sued - I guess you might draw something out of that if your grasping. 
So I guess you could say e-gold is to bitcoin as Napster was to bit torrent. 
Of course then you might want to say something like Myspace and facebook... but somebody else might throw in Green eggs - and Ham.  
Imagine the concept - Napster - wow, able to share files without going through a third party for permission.  Bitcoin - wow what a concept - able to send money without a third party for permission.  Pretty soon people are going to wonder why we have the centralized structures demanding we get permission first. The nerve of the common man.

It CAN be extremely hard to steal. Yes, wallets get hacked daily...today. Last line on point, multi-sig wallets will require two, three or more private keys to unlock. MUCH harder for hacker to get if they are divided and separated. Doesn't say they WILL be safer. The opportunity is there.
All 22 items are properties. Of course that in itself is not synonymous, so I take care to show that SOMEBODY would find that property valuable. Those two ingredients together = intrinsic value - be the WIKI definition.  But can you say that not ONE of these properties will be valuable to just ONE person?  Value is subjective, buy my guess a LOT of people might find certain properties listed valuable. It might be silly to claim otherwise.
I appreciate your feedback.

In a way you are right. If the bitcoin network gets compromised temporarily that could cause a loss in trust. But this article is meant to convey that there is no person deciding that you are 'allowed' to make an exchange of value. It's not up to any person, it's math. It only accounts for bitcoin ownership and makes no moral choices with it. This article tries to identify "true north" in principle only. If trust is temporarily lost - or even if the bitcoin network itself completely breaks down  - we still will know the way "true north" and the next version will still head that way.

IRS Changes Course and Declares Bitcoin a Currency
@_date: 2014-05-08 01:32:38
Kind of true. There are two sides to the equation.
1.  Property,
2. Value
But because value is subjective, there are different audiences or groups of people that would value certain portions of the properties for different reasons. I thought it might be too confusing to jumble them all together so   I chose to draw out the meaningful uses of the property for the different targets that would find that useful, and why.  My list was actually 25 and I did consolidate some of them so I get what you are saying.. I was looking to at least get it to a "top 20" but then I would think of another to add to the list.  You could probably think of five I didn't include off the top of your head?
@_date: 2014-05-07 18:25:52
Nothing has intrinsic value? So the dictionary, Wikipedia and generally accepted view of people around the world are wrong? You've just redefined the term?
1. Which of the 22 items is not a property of bitcoin?
2. Which of the 22 items is would not be considered valuable by anybody?
3. Which of these properties can you get from other sources?
If anybody believes these things, it has intrinsic value to them. It's all subjective. Because they aren't important to you doesn't make them irrelevant to everybody... Except to the narcissistic dictators among us?  Kim Jong Hugolp.

It's true, a bit of tweaking would have helped. I was actually surprised this was published long after I wrote it. Had I known, I would have updated it and polished it a bit more. One of the holdups was the very point your bring up - the block chain really doesn't have a long history and hasn't had time to prove itself infallible. But the blockchain isn't just a technology - it's far bigger.  It's a fundamental principal of a new paradigm. Principles don't change - they are like natural law. What we value, and how we value principles do change. The point was that principles transcend people and politics. There will be (and are) other blockchains other than bitcoin, but taken together they represent and idea who's time has come. More to come on that theme.

I think you are right. In fact I said as much in  People in power find ways to co-op new advances and maintain their power. But the block chain is a way for people to have a chance at least. Bitcoin won't erase banks or the need for credit. Somebody has to borrow money to start new businesses and loans have their place.  Hopefully bitcoin can level the playing field and offer many other advances that throttle the all powerful banking system. At least force them to compete. We win either way.

x99x, I don't suppose you meant to label or judge the content of the article based on the school in which the author received a degree. I supposed that a person of intellect would already know that their own argument is a logical fallacy known as " Ad Hominem ".

If you are that desperate to have to resort to a technique easily recognized and called out by a University of Phoenix grad, what can we deduce about your own education level? Or the probability of you still living in your mother's basement?

Well, ya - You've probably found it's a tricky concept to explain to "regular people". There are certain concepts I tried to avoid for new people because it tends to freak them out.
The concept of Mining (Rather than just processing), Multisig (by that name), Block-chain (by that name). Many unusual or foreign sounding words at once seems to make their brain short circuit.  Once they get comfortable with the basics - they can get those other points. At least in my experience.

Yes, it's an oxymoron from a dictionary point of view, that's why I selected the economic theory point of view which is more applicable because the entire article deals with economics verses science. 
Everybody will subjectively value the same object differently. The intensity is measured in terms of supply and demand. Price is the equilibrium between the two. Both the buyer and the seller think they are getting the better deal, that's why the trade is made. If a price goes up, more people desire it, or expect that somebody else will desire it more in the future. I listed 22 reasons why somebody could place value in it. But there would be people (at the north pole?) who might find none of these factors compelling. 
The article intent was an answer to many people who continue to take it upon themselves to speak for EVERYBODY that NOBODY would find ANY reason for it to have value. This is the common misconception a lot of people have, so it was time somebody called them on it.

If you cannot, then ask which one would not be considered valuable by ANYONE?  If only ONE PERSON finds it valuable - it has inherent value to that person. That's the only the required to meet the definition. 
The bread comparison is drawn just to show that value is SUBJECTIVE.
Then I make the point almost item by item that SOMEBODY might find that property useful.

Number 12, Corruption thrives and requires opaqueness. If you click the link referenced you will see the leading causes of corruption are lack of transparency. - Bitcoin technology allows for public view of the block chain by wallet address. Simply making this pubic, you can view any amounts spent and track the money flow. This is fact, not opinion.
15, More difficult to be used as surveillance. Simply the reverse of number 12. You don't have to make wallets public, and can use mixing services and other wallet technology to resist surveillance. Why one might want has been mentioned on several forums and a simple Google search will give you days of materials to read. 
16, See the moves with SecondMarket the CEO Barry Silbert has given many interviews on the subject. 
17. I offered the link as proof you can independently verify. That information was issued by "venturescanner.com" which I have no affiliation or connection.
18. I'll give you that one.  I could have found more resources to make that claim.
22. I think I made my case by including the first 21 in summation. But I welcome your opinion. I would be shocked if everybody agreed with everything I wrote. You'd likely agree there are few people narcissist enough to think everything they write is gospel to be accepted by all.

But bitcoin started from ZERO only five years ago and has to supply the entire world. Fed money is just PART of money creation.  Loans made create money on the books, which is then used to make new loans in an inverted pyramid. 
If bitcoin could ever be a world currency, it's got a lot inflation to go, but it still has to be tapered. Bubbles will develop along the way as people rush out and get ahead of it. It also has to work on being much more liquid so bubbles of activity rushing in or out are created. They probably will continue for years.   It's still a baby.

Of course the people on the reddit bitcoin subgroup would be able to spot that right away and might disagree if they know of major differences between the two.

thanks for your opinions redditsscum (that's weird typing your name...I feel...so...disrespectful). Hopefully seeing a bunch of centralized VC's are just a drop in the bucket for the potential the protocol has in the entire world. But they will be key in getting it adopted. Just like the crappy exchanges were vital in getting bitcoin into hands of many more people to spread them around. Most imploded but they served a vital function while they were here. It had to get out of the hands of the miners and into the hands of gamblers, and the other first users. Libertarians \ anarchist have served a vital purpose in birthing it. Satoshi himself my have fit this description, so I wouldn't diss' that group either.  There will likely be all kinds of groups in the future that one could describe in a similar manner. It might appeal to certain groups for certain reasons important the them as it grows and weaves in and out of subcultures. New people may discover new uses for it that effect them directly.

This article references payment systems only. Specifically credit cards. Exchanges and banks are an entirely different topic. Important yes, but out of scope.
Now, minor inconvenience?  Um...no.  They say 1/3 of the US was affected by the Target hack. Getting new cards, disputing the charges...You account and personal information is now on the black market with tools so sophisticated they can sort by zip code. 
Giving your credit card out for a $20.00 item is giving away your keys to your account. $5,000 charge for $20.00?  And your personal information is out there?  
Compare that to a bitcoin transaction. Bitcoins are not "Promise to pay" they are payment in full. There is no need to get any personal information at all. Let alone the keys to your bank account. 
Taken fully as an industry view? 1/3 of all merchant costs in credit cards goes to fight fraud. If they could lower all prices by 1/3 as the fraud becomes obsolete wouldn't that benefit all? 
Bitcoin wallets can be hacked - it's true (although you'll have to show me how cold wallets can be hacked). The technology for switching over isn't ready yet. But it's coming.
@_date: 2014-05-07 21:22:13
Correct. You can have "innate" properties. But it is up to people to assign value to those properties.  That's why the term intrinsic value is two words.
1. Is it a property of the subject?
  2. if number 1 = true, does somebody place value in that property?
    3.  If number 2 = true, then intrinsic value = true.
Intrinsic value = false.
@_date: 2014-05-07 23:28:21
Hmmm. Explain that one to me.  Bitcoin isn't issued by banks. 
It exists and maintained by a computer program already programmed years ago. The amount of coins to ever be issued was already decided long ago.  The property of coin inflation is a core part of the program and is kept in check by all the payment processors. They have financial motivation to keep things just the way they are. You would have to accept the idea that they would be willing to allow a program change that would reduce the value of the currency they hold to allow that change to happen.  Then you would have to believe that over 50% of the world-wide population that runs the network would all agree to it at the same time. The currency runs on consensus - which then keeps it in check.
Welcome to decentralized currency.
@_date: 2017-02-15 08:33:56
Yeah, I don't think I would compare them as currencies as ETH isn't really meant to be a currency.

The cover is pictured on all kinds of new channels when then need a graphic to show the audience for their story. (The Guy Fawkes cover) .
**1.**  The first full page ad is for Casascius coins. (Later banned by he government).
**2.**  The third Ad was for "Paytunia" which ceased operations within a year.
**3.**  BitInstant (Charly Sherm's former company which was shut down by the FBI)
**4.**  Next was a bitcoin casino called 'Strake Sapphire" (strikesapphire.com)  hosted out of Costa Rica - is now illegal to use from US locations. 
**5.**  An exchange company called "CryptoXchange.com" had a full two page ad and was out of operations just five months later after being called a 'scam'.
**6.**  Liberty Reserve (wm-center.com) - Seized by the FBI. 
The magazine also had a full feature interview the Charley Shrem.
There were only a couple of ads for companies still around only three years later:-
including: CryptoAnarchy.com, Bitpay, and Coinabul.
The point is that this is the nature of the beast. I'm sure ALL bitcoin news sites were getting the same advertisements from the same people we are just lucky to have a printed copy of the Bitcoin Magazine that is 'frozen in time' that we can refer to because it was printed out. 
Having a little bit of wisdom and realize hindsight is always 20\20 instead of real time when when your chances are only 50\50.
Young internet reporting publications get advertisements where they can. We are in the very, very early phases so just try to keep that perspective in mind before casting stones.  Two years from now we'll all have a new perspective off all the companies doing business today. I suspect most of them will be out of business as well as the newer more mature and established big money ventures take over. But we were here to see it and live it and I do like that 'crowd' can help regulate bad behavior - we might just want to consider it with a bit more wisdom.  Something to consider...

You first. Target took three weeks to discover and then report the biggest credit card data breach in history. Since then Tiger Direct and Overstock announced support for bitcoin payments as well as a host of others that have garnered a ton of new attention. I for one think of anybody continuing to trust credit card use as being a bit hesitant. Like getting in the ocean when you know there have been reports of sharks in the water. I'll wait to see how many people get bitten before I get back in the water. - so...you first.  As far as a turning point - It  probably won't happen right away, But, perhaps one day - history might look back, and depending on how this gets solved - weather through a new "Target" like attacks, or simply through disruption of service from the PCI enforcement on a huge scale - people might reconsider the value of bitcoin.  Thinking long term trends here not firehouse emergencies.  Plus, it's NOT the attack itself - PCI will view XP machines are immediately disqualified regardless of an actual attack. Big difference. Fines range from 5,000 per month to 100,000 per month - PLUS revocation. The Target damage is still rippling through the system. Big companies are thinking "Who's next?". It might drag Target to bankruptcy.  Who's lining up next to follow that? Reasonable people might consider these issues and it might view bitcoin in a new light. This is why it could be a defining moment in history, only from the future perspective.

I don't believe I inferred that we should or could eliminate the concept of debt. Of course we should have debt as it serves a purpose, but should we BASE our monetary system on debt?  Has this ever proven sustainable in history? (say for an entire generation).

I've given a point-by-point rebuttal of his interview on my new website. Nick Weaver attempts several logical fallacy methods to try to manipulate the listener.  His arguments break down and his reasoning could be dismantled by a first-year law school student.  Please check out my website for more details.
As other people often repeat many of these same mistaken points - it might be helpful for you to understand how to break them down for other conversations you may have on these topics as well.

My point was that bitcoin is an uncorrelated asset. When contagion of the centralized systems started to collapse, bitcoin would have sat outside of the system. It will be interesting to see what happens to its value when this happens next.  Although with the pain that is sure to ensue - I'm certainly not hoping for it to happen.  Bitcoin IS our short.

It's the whole house of cards when you have fractional reserve banking as your monetary base. Money based on debt, when the borrowing stops and is saturated - it all comes crumbling down.  There is something to be said for a high-powered asset holding itself up. They say don't swim near a drowning man. Likely true with a drowning bank as well. 
When the contagion begins again and the safety of bonds or other fiat-based asset value they are holding vanishes the sinking feeling returns - remember that sinking feeling you got in 2008?  Did you see the HBO movie "Too Big to Fail"?  Add them together and say hello to your little friendly paper bitcoin wallet that is no other person's liability. I don't pretend to think bitcoin would solve all the world financial problems, but it's nice to have a 'plan b'- and as we walked out of the theater I literally told my wife "and that's why I own bitcoin".

With gold you are buying traditional precious metal that originally was used in art and coins. It eventually became money because it was dividable, commonly recognized, portable rare, and desirable. With critical mass - it eventually retained its value. Its value is only backed up by its subject opinions of what people were will to trade for it.
With bitcoin you have all the same classifications except its utility is different. It makes for a great accounting system that works all over the world at once, can be transferred globally, isn't counterfeiter-able but doesn't have a long history of being a stable value because people don't yet understand its one true value some would argue is its own intrinsic value. It is TRUST that has been tokenized and commoditized. You can append data to it and put it on the blockchain ledger were it is immutable. You can trust that what goes there - stays there including any 'proof' that something happened which is also time-stamped an can't be removed. Tokenized Trust gives power to people rather than corruptible governments and power structures. 
We are now in the price discovery phase of how much people are willing to pay for the concept of TRUST.  It's likely to be found highly prized. The ownership of the 'page spaces" to write that trust is transferable in the form of a digital token protected by encryption. You now pay for the potential future use of that utility. There is a finite amount and decrease of the rate of issuance which squeezes the price higher. More demand from people discovering 'the token of truth'.

I wrote about the dangers of exchanges including Cryptsy in a three-part article for Bitcoin Magazine two years ago. 
I watered down the Cryptsy concerns I had because MT Gox was starting to crumble during my writing and research and I didn't want to add fuel to the fire so everybody would abandon bitcoin. Still it's still a somewhat handy reference to the research we can put in before we send our money and hope it stays around.

Fiat literally means..."let it be done". It is an order issued by authority. Bitcoin has no authority. Nobody assigned value except the free market. You CAN issue an order of fiat that IS backed by something. No rules on that. Bitcoin does have subjective value that is derived intrinsically.. That is the properties that make bitcoin a bitcoin come from within itself. The zeros and ones that create unique crypto protected immutable open ledger entries to record ownership don't come from somewhere else. These are all properties of the bitcoin blockchain, payment system, token. Like all things in the world, value is subjective. However, in economic terms, the economic subjective intrinsic value of bitcoin might surpass anything 'solid' your grandpa can think of. If somebody else in the world values it more than you and is willing to trade other things they regard less valuable (say US Dollars), then the bitcoin has value to others as the price was just set.
You can also think of what backing bitcoin is that huge computer power network that protects the blockchain now tipping the scales at over 400 petahash. This is what separates bitcoin from any altcoin that might otherwise have similar properties. I think you'll see most other efforts do side-chains or build on top of the bitcoin protocol now. Bitcoin is becoming the horse they will want to hitch their wagon to.
I like to occasionally pull out this article I wrote last year about bitcoin's intrinsic value as a handy reference to those new to bitcoin.

I've given a few speeches on it. Five to seven minutes a few times. An attention grabber was pointing out how on Sept 12, 2008 we were within three hours of having the entire banking system of the world come crashing down and marshal law. US Treasury Poulson's book "On the Brink" and several other accounts from congress and others in the room corroborate. We may be witnessing the death of money as we know it.

The point is that everybody can view the blockchain for trust - not a third party. The consensus method is resistant to censorship. This 'fixes' many of the world problems coming from the human greed, and corruption which is always hidden.

My advice to my friends and family is only invest an amount you won't loose sleep over. If this is even a question you might consider throttling back at the next rise in price. Bitcoin price should be viewed in 5 to 10 years time horizon, not measured in months. It will change the world, but a lot of moving pieces need to align first. It will take some time. Go watch a movie.

One thing is to not be another victim of "Target" or the next store that gets the credit cards hacked.  Paying with bitcoin means you never have to give them your banking id\credit card number \ pin... "keys to your kingdom". If you pay in bitcoin, just like cash - it's done. Better for everybody -cheaper for vendor, you keep your privacy hand hassle of getting new cards because your were stolen.
