I've only been a BitInstant "customer" for the past several weeks... I say "customer" because their service has literally been down more than up since I registered.  Although I've never had an issue getting my coins from them, as I know many others have, I'm strongly considering just sticking with LocalBitcoins and other services even after BitInstant returns.  The unpredictability and changes in their service make me feel uncomfortable as a consumer.  Unless they reduce their rates or offer some other incentives, it will be hard to for them to lure me (and others I imagine) back to them.

Don't forget that BTC is a fiat currency backed by nothing but belief, too!  The only reason it has any monetary value is because people are beginning to agree that it does.

Thanks for the reference!  I'll have to check it out tonight...
As for the horror stories, I tried locating the posts I had in mind but I can't seem to find them.  Anyways, over the past few weeks I've ocassionaly read about people having difficulty with their paper wallets; everything from trouble with the passwords to flat out losing the paper wallet.

Maybe I'll try it with a small test amount.

The market is overbought right now and chances are a correction/crash is on the horizon. The big question is where is the ceiling and where is the floor. Nobody knows. It's probably not a good time to totally buy back in. If you really feel the need to get in, then just invest a small portion right now and see what happens next week.

Apparently I can trade it... I just can't withdraw it!

I have fractions left from when I bought some back around $100/BTC. I plan on giving some of it away to family and friends at Christmas :-) Maybe it will go up by next Christmas, maybe it won't, but I'll help get the word out. Any ideas on how to set up wallets for everyone? I'm thinking making online accounts for everyone, as I don't want to do paper wallets.

Updating for the sake of those in the near future with the same question:
I was able to deposit 0.001 no problem.  However, I cannot withdraw because my account is unverified.

I stated the following two facts:
* BTC itself is a fiat currency.  As such, it is backed by nothing but belief.
* BTC only has value because people agree that it does, just like any other currency.
Please explain how/why your *claim*


contradicts either of the two facts I listed above.
