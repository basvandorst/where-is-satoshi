That would have saved a lot of typing :) I usually say that if every grain of sand on Earth grew to size of the Earth itself, then every grain of sand on each of those Earths will still have more Bitcoin addresses available to it than there are the total number of IP addresses there are on the Internet today. IPv4 and IPv6. 
And that's just Bitcoin. There are dozens of coins.

LibertyX. They partnered with thousands of stores nationwide. You walk in, hand over cash and either get or give a PIN code, depending on the sales model the store uses.
Because they only accept cash, transfers start immediately when you or the salesperson enters the PIN. And since they don't offer web wallets you are required to provide the Bitcoin address for the deposit. You are could always provide a web wallet deposit address, but that defeats the main benefit.  
Mycelium and LibertyX ftw.

Because NYC is central to the global financial system.
Just like some people wake up one day and decide to start a taxi service free of all regulation, some other people woke up and decided to become a bank free of all regulation. These regulations were developed in the wake of MTGOX by the people who have to oversee some of the world's largest financial institutions from a regulatory perspective.
They know better than anyone what poorly run banks and other financial institutions are capable of doing with other peoples' money. You must prove to regulators that you truly understand what's involved in managing other peoples' money.
You just have to convince a lot more people (and do it more convincingly) when you want to run that kind of business in NY.

I watch using iStream on Kodi. You always get commercial free edits on streaming services, but whoever's posting the eps is posting the unedited, uninterrupted version. Much more like an HBO version than a USA version.
As a 22 year Linux guy and longtime user of BitchX with a couple of spare Raspberry Pis sitting around, I'm eating it up. I know it's cool to say it sucks, but to someone who went through many similar phases over a few decades, it's pretty cool.
I'm just glad my wife knows about Linux (our first real PC ran Slackware 3.0 installed from floppies) and has had a Mycelium wallet for about two years before seeing all that stuff on the show.
For the uninitiated, I can see it being completely foreign. For long (LONG) time geeks, it's nice to see it get some attention.

Think of the hardware wallets as devices that give private keys to NO ONE. When you interact with them, you send them the address you wish to send funds to and the amount to send. They receive the request, create the transaction in a portion of the device that is not reachable by the outside world, digitally sign it, and then return to your device the signed transaction that just needs to be broadcast to the world. The devices never let you see the private keys because you don't need to. 
It comes down whether you prefer completely open source software that was just recently developed or mostly open source software that relies upon proprietary highly specialized hardware that has been protecting bank cards around the world for decades. 
You can use Mycelium as a UI for hardware wallets, where the private keys are never exposed even to Mycelium. Use a USB OTG adapter to plug your HW wallet into your phone to construct and sign the transaction and use your phone to propagate it. 
I prefer the Ledger Nano myself. It is smaller than my house key on my keychain and the smart chip doubles a USB interface. You literally plug it directly into your USB port. No cables. It's a gorgeous little thing once you wrap your mind around what it does and what it all means.
@_date: 2016-08-26 20:05:32
Where are you? Check out LibertyX.com/locations and see if they have a store near you. My daily limit is $1,000 and their transfers are instant. Depending on the type of store, you either give them cash and get a PIN code in return, or you get a PIN code from the app, give them the cash and then show them the app. 
Either way, because it is done in cash, transfers are instant. My BTC is usually inbound before I'm leaving the store. And they don't offer web wallets. You must tell them the deposit address, which can be anywhere -- even your friend's address in Norway if you want. 
Walk into a store. Pay cash. Bitcoin starts arriving before you leave the store.

I believe the worst time they were hacked was when someone figured out how to determine private keys from the Bitcoin addresses created by their not-so-random address generator. Luckily, a white hat drained a bunch of BTC and established a mechanism for giving everyone their money back once they can prove ownership and use a more secure system. 
I only use bc.i when I want to click on the amount transferred in a transaction to flip back and forth between BTC and USD. Nothing else.

I frequently search Google for
congressional research service cryptocurrency
to see what our legislators are being told about crypto and what they're thinking of doing about what they're hearing. To actually dig into the hearings and legislation being written, I use the Congress app on Android by the Sunlight Foundation and popvox.com to read and respond to proposed bills. Popvox began as a place for intelligent discourse but something happened a few years ago and the Jer-ry! Jer-ry! crowd took it over and treated it like a Facebook comment section. They don't realize that every comment is delivered on paper to your congressman and often earns a formal reply, also on paper. 
CRS, the Congress App and Popvox are three amazing ways to keep up with exactly what is happening in DC. You read what they're reading, you see the hearings being scheduled and you can follow the text of the legislation being built with a mechanism to provide direct feedback into the system.

Did you get a deposit address from Circle or did you send funds from Circle to Blockchain earlier and just try to send some back to the same address that sent them to you? It doesn't work both ways when an exchange is involved.
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:14:48
Cool, don't forget to pair it with your phone for two factor authentication. Whenever you go to send BTC, you will be asked to confirm the transaction via an app on your phone to make sure no malware on your PC is attempting to drain your Nano.
The argument used to be that it is damn near impossible to hack the Nano smart chip and it is "impossible squared" that the same party would hack your PC, your Nano AND your phone so that all three would display the transaction you requested while colluding to send your balance to a different address. But if your phone is the interface you use to request a transaction AND receive authorization for the transaction coming back from the Nano, hmm. A few too many eggs in one basket, IYAM. 
The Ledger guys are also doing some really cool stuff basically building the Nano into a highly secure execution environment that probably .0001% of the population realizes they have in their phones. Just like the "real" Nano, the key management and transaction signing process happens in a part of the phone that the main OS cannot access.
Millions of phones basically ship with a free Nano inside that just needs to be activated. These guys are good.

It doesn't tie back that way. Your helper may have been looking at IP addresses that broadcast transactions to try to figure out which organization was broadcasting the transaction.
You can create a valid address by tossing dice. Addresses are not assigned to organizations who later hand them out like IP addresses.

I feel like we need to know a little more about your situation. Is this a one time payment and one time conversion? Are you selling something like a car and want to receive their payment in BTC even if they can only pay in cash? Are you a landlord who wants to get paid in BTC? Is someone slowly paying a loan back to you? Are you selling stuff on Etsy?
The frequency and amount of the payment as well as whether or not you're meeting them in person all matter in determining the most appropriate method.
If you're a contractor or landlord, you can sign up at Bitwage and generate invoices that will be paid in cash but delivered to you in BTC. If you're selling a car or TV, then Circle sounds good. If someone is paying off a loan in person, then you can meet at a LibertyX store. You tell the cashier the pin code for the deposit and your friend hands over the cash to the cashier. You will immediately receive it in BTC.
You can do the same thing with any face to face exchange, like local Bitcoins or Mycelium's Buy/Sell feature. Your friend pays the seller and the seller gives you the BTC. Or just accept the cash and take it to the seller yourself. If the debtor is far away, they can even do the Mycelium or LBC buy themselves and just show the seller your deposit QR code. 
How much, how often and how they are delivering the money to you all matter. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 13:00:08
Yes that would be fine. Keep in mind bc.i was hacked a long time ago where their key generation system turned out to not be so random. Luckily a white hat hacker drained numerous accounts before black hats could and he setup a way to give everyone their money back. 
If you find that you like Electrum, you can eventually learn about the TAILS OS, which intentionally forgets everything you did online during each session. You have to setup Electrum each time you boot up in TAILS, but if you can remember 13 words in a specific order you have a pretty awesome system. 
Make sure you have them backed up somewhere, though. You wouldn't want your family to lose access to a couple million dollars you had squirreled away because a drunk driver ran a red light.

A company that makes it easy to buy and sell Bitcoin was not safely storing the Bitcoin that customers were keeping there. An attacker figured out how to steal about $70-95 million worth of Bitcoin, depending on who you ask. 
It's important to note that this attack did not exploit any flaws in the way Satoshi designed Bitcoin. It was a failure in IT security. If you use a Ledger or Trezor to protect your funds, this type of attack would never happen to you. 
@_date: 2016-08-21 23:58:19
1. No. It is important to understand that you are not storing actual Bitcoins anywhere. You are storing secret values that can be used to spend your BTC or (more likely) you are storing 12 to 25 words that will regenerate all those secret values. Do you really need to buy a USB drive to never forget 12-25 words? No.
    Plus, as has been suggested, if you're going to use a device that plugs into your USB port, get a device that is specially designed to protect your balances. It uses the words I described above to generate the secret values, but stores the secret values in a type of memory that you can't access. That is the new minimum for security.
    Ledger makes such devices based on the smartchips that have been protecting bank card transactions around the world for nearly two decades. Their HW.1 is barely larger than the chip on your ATM card. Their Nano is the same chip on a piece of metal about half the size of a house key. Both shape the smartchip so that it physically doubles as a USB interface. You literally insert one end of the device into your USB port. Their Nano S is a new design, not like the rest of their product line. They are also releasing software that emulates their hardware devices in a special high-security region of some Samsung phones.
2. I've used LibertyX for a while. They are an exchange, but they don't offer web wallets. The purchases happen so quickly that your money is never really tied up there for more than a minute. Of course, they are not a full service exchange, so they don't offer buy and sell services -- only buy. They require you to provide your own address each time you buy BTC, making it the perfect service for people who manage their own addresses and keys.
3. Again, up to you. I'm in the process of transitioning to Bitwage to receive a portion of my paycheck in BTC, so it's good for me and my appetite for risk.
4.  Think of Bitcoin as one big bank with virtually unlimited bank accounts available -- enough accounts to not only service every person on earth, but to create new accounts for every monetary transaction that ever occurs within the system, between human and non-human systems and actors.
    The real breakthrough is that is everyone agrees what the balances are in every address without the use of a central authority. That part is called the blockchain and is all the rage as the corporate world figures out how it can use Bitcoin (or parts of it).
@_date: 2016-08-27 21:40:35
Love my Ledger Nano. It's so compact and you can tell it was built by professionals. Separately, I also found it pretty easy to memorize my 12 words for Electrum on TAILS. Forget trying to protect the keys, they don't exist anywhere until I boot up and type in my words.

Have you visited yet? It was designed around a shower thought about everyone giving one random person a dollar each month. It's something of a showcase for crypto.
Just remember if you enter the contest, you are entering a social contract to donate to the eventual winner. I stopped playing because over 30,000 people enter in a typical month and the winners receive about $1,500 on average (out of over $30,000 according to the rules). So many people enter and walk away when they don't win.

Mycelium is widely regarded as the best for Android. It has a face to face purchase system setup where you hand over cash for BTC.

Not sure how familiar you are with addresses vs wallets vs HD wallets. Satoshi's original intent was that no single address ever be loaded and emptied more than once. That's part of the reason behind the ridiculously high number of addresses available.
BIP 39 specifies a method for using a specially crafted list of 12 words to generate a vast number of addresses that are to be used one after another in a set sequence. You may also generate an unlimited number of sequences all based from the same word list. All of the words that can be used as seed words have been published. There are only about 2,500. Each new sequence of 12 of the 2,500 words will generate a virtually unlimited number of sets of virtually unlimited addresses, with all addresses in each given sequence linked to the one ahead and behind it in line. The same exact sequence of 12 words will generate the same exact sets of sequences of numbers every time. That is central to why it doesn't matter if you lose a hardware wallet like a Trezor or Ledger. So long as you wrote down your seed words, you can reestablish full control of your balances by entering the same words in a new device (or compatible software if you don't want to buy another device).
So in the original post, you described just checking random addresses looking for a balance -- something that is statistically not possible to occur before the sun collapses and dies. I merely described a more "efficient" way of searching. Using the list of 2,500 words, start generating random groups of 12 of those words.
Then using each list of 12 words, calculate the first set of addresses that are generated in the first wallet. Check the first address generated in the first wallet against the database. The address may have a 0 balance now but the important question is did it ever contain a balance? If it did, then you know the virtually unlimited number of addresses to check to look for where any remaining balance may currently be sitting.
Of course, the rules don't state that you must use the first generated address in the sequence so you should probably check the first 10 addresses to see if any of them ever had a balance. Also, HD wallets like Mycelium make it very easy to start all over with a whole new sequence of addresses to use also still using the same word list. So not only do you need to check the first 10 or so addresses of the first sequence generated by the words you chose, you should actually check the first 10 addresses of the first 10 sequences of addresses to see if someone tried to outsmart the system by starting with the 8th address in the fifth sequence of addresses generated by their randomly assigned words.
So each time your script picks 12 random words out of the list of 2,500, you know the first 100 addresses to check to see if any of them were ever the start of a sequence of addresses that were used in a series of transactions.
Finally, just because you checked an address and found it wasn't used in an HD wallet doesn't mean it can't be used a split second after you checked it. So that means that every time your script grabs another 12 words and generates the first 10 addresses from the first 10 sequences, you also need to go back and continuously check all the other sets of 100 addresses you generated from all other random groups of words.
So in the end, your script will
1. constantly pick groups of 12 random words from the published set of 2,500
1. generate the first 10 addresses from the first 10 sets of addresses
1. add those 100 addresses to the list of addresses that need to be continuously checked to see if they _ever_ held a balance
1. continuously check all of the addresses that your looping address generation script has generated to see if they ever held a balance (not necessarily that they hold one now)
while you realize that some people have a several year lead on you. Finally (again), people like me start a new sequence of addresses to use each time I buy some BTC. I have a pile of HD wallets that all end in a 0 balance. So even if you do find a used HD wallet sometime in the next 40 years, the pot at the end of the rainbow may actually be empty.
That's why you will see a constant flow of posts in here from people asking how to recover their funds without their word list and other people respond with "you've lost your money, next time write down your words when they tell you to".
You asked how much bandwidth one would consume by checking addresses. If you've read all the way through this, you now know that that is the least of your concerns.

You don't use bandwidth for constant checking. You run a node locally which you would then query within your own network. Anyone can run a node. Takes a handful of days to start from zero and any DSL or cable modem can keep up. Also, don't generate individual addresses. Instead, generate random word lists and check the first address in the sequence to see if it ever held a balance. Even if it is at zero today, you can figure out if it is the first address in a sequence that may hold a balance somewhere down the line. If it never held a balance, you can skip the trillions of addresses behind It. Keep in mind that you can create a virtually unlimited number of address sequences from a single list of words, so you can't just check the first address of the first wallet. Also, you're not required to use the first address in each wallet, so you have to check the first 10 addresses of the first 10-20 wallets generated from each word list. Oh, and since any address can be used at any time, you also need to go back and check every address you've ever generated all along the way while constantly checking new addresses. 
tl;dr Using word lists will eliminate trillions upon trillions of addresses to check. You still won't find anything.

One of the easiest ways to earn Bitcoin through work is to sign up at Bitwage. Virtually all businesses that don't pay under the table offer direct deposit of your paycheck straight into your bank account. 
Bitwage offers to receive your paycheck deposit and transform any percentage of it into Bitcoin while sending the remainder onto your bank as cash.
In a utopian world, Bitcoin will be an option for receiving your pay, but in today's world you need something like Bitwage to receive your salary in Bitcoin. Yes, someone in here just paid a neighborhood kid in Bitcoin for help in the garden so it's not impossible. The shorter route is just to get any regular job and have Bitwage convert some or all of your paycheck to BTC.

As I work for one of the largest employers on earth, I hoped that Bitwage has at least one other client who has gone through the process. I'm hearing crickets from them as all. 
With the price crash this weekend, I definitely want to get this setup so I can DCA through the next rise.

It was done in the very early days to reverse someone exploiting a bug and creating millions (billions?) of BTC. I, too, was unhappy with the HF. The BTC HF was different, though. It was broken. The DAO contract ran as programmed. Sorry the guys who shipped it fucked it up and ignored (albeit last minute) warnings. Them's the breaks. I work (but definitely don't speak) for IBM, and we are in the midst of some huge breakouts in private blockchain developments. The noise was just getting to a certain level about public vs private blockchain and the HF destroyed any chance of the public blockchain earning respect in corporate circles. Gone. And that broke my heart a little.

You don't send them the private key. They send you the address or show you the QR code where to send the payment. Then you use an app like Mycelium to send a payment to the payment address they gave you. You would then scan the private key on your paper wallet (the "Spend" QR) and send the payment. It can be complicated to make sure the change is returned to your paper wallet, that's why if you insist on doing it that way it's best to use an app that has been supporting that function for a long time. 
Mycelium does it just fine. It is just not the norm anymore, using and reusing a single address with a paper wallet.

The process of adding new BTC is going to slow down so much, that it is going to take 55 years to mine the last 10 BTC. So while the last few Satoshis won't be mined until 2140, there effectively won't be any new BTC in circulation long before that.

Just use an HD wallet, which is just about any good software wallet out there (and the software component of every hardware wallet). It moves the change after every spend to a new address, and updates your receiving address accordingly. Don't worry, it will still pick up any deposits made on old addresses. 
Instead of backing up a single private key that corresponds to just one address, you write down 12 or 24 words that will be used to generate all the addresses your wallet has ever used and will ever use going forward. Just don't ever lose your 24 words.

Keep in mind the tax discussion. You need to track how much you paid for all your BTC and how much it was worth when you spent it or sold it (and therefore whether it made or lost value while you held it).
So if you spend $400 worth of BTC at Amazon, would you rather calculate how much tax you owe when $100 worth of BTC you bought at once increased to $400 or would you rather figure out how much each of 600 purchases at less than a $1 went up or down while you were holding them?
That's why I don't use the loose change apps. Your recordkeeping requirements can explode.

It's not a phone. It's the same size and half the thickness of a SIM card. You lay your SIM card on top of it and slide the two items into the SIM slot together.
The device allows all the regular phone activities to pass through back and forth between the phone and the SIM card but it also adds a wallet as a SIM card app to any phone that uses SIM cards.
It is not a smartphone app, it's a SIM card app. It operates at a different level and does not require a smartphone.

You could move to Puerto Rico and apply for Act 22. You pay near 0 capital gains tax on assets you acquire after moving there and you pay a ratio of capital gains tax on assets you brought with you when you moved there calculated by "1 - (how long you've been a legal resident of PR / how long you've held the asset)".
So if you've held BTC for 4 years but lived there for 1 year before spending your BTC, your capital gains tax bill is adjusted to 1-(1/4) or 75% of your full bill.
Of course, that was a more interesting proposal before September.

When a fork occurs, you have the same number of coins on two chains. You need to be careful when sending coin at first because if the client you're using has not been updated, you may end up sending the coins on both chains when you only intended to send one.
Ledger handles this by offering to create a new set of keys and addresses that are split away from the original chain with both coins. When you want to split your new coins off from main, you choose the new coin on split, copy down the receive address, switch over to the new coin on main, and then send your balance of new coins on main to the address you copied to the clipboard while in the new coin's split view.
So again:
1. Go into the new coin split view. You should have 0 balance.
1. Copy the receive address.
1. Switch to the new coin main view. Your balance here in the new coin will match the balance of the original coin.
1. Initiate a send transaction to empty your current balance of the new coin in the main view.
1. Paste in the receive address that you copied from the new coin's split view.
1. Execute the transaction.
1. You will end up with a 0 balance on the new coin's main view and your original balance will now show up on the new coin's split view.
That is how you safely split your coins in Ledger.

Interesting discussion. Clearly a lot people don't yet realize that you should create a new address just for this sale. If you do that, no one will be able to trace your transactions, especially if the first thing you do after selling the car is run the BTC through an exchange or tumbler. 
As far as asking to see your Bitcoin address, that is one way for potential buyers to see if you are scamming them -- they can watch the address to see if any funds have arrived. Of course, you can combat that by establishing a new address for every potential buyer. Then they _really_ have no visibility into your other financial activities, even with other potential buyers of your car. 
Just setup a new address for the sale or each interested party. Run the BTC through ShapeShift into ETH and then back into a different BTC address so whomever pays you can't follow the money.

Fun fact: If you cut the wallets out perfectly along the lines and then fold them veritcally so that the Load &amp; Verify address covers the Spend address, the folded wallet will fit perfectly inside a pocket designed to hold pictures of your family in your actual wallet in your pocket.

Thus choosing to file a fraudulent return. That's the decision you need to make and weigh the possible ramifications. Exiting BTC to lock in your gains is a taxable event, even when you exit BTC to another crypto. The tax isn't triggered by going to fiat. It's triggered by exiting a position with gains.
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:33:52
Transferring BTC in one wallet to BTC in another wallet is not taxable if that's what you're asking. Exchanging BTC to ETH to "lock in gains" from BTC is taxable. ETH is a new asset.
Say you know this BTC bubble is about to pop. You bought in at $500 and swap it to a more stable coin at $12,000. Then, sure enough, BTC tanks but the more stable coin you got into is spared. You still have your $12,000. So you swap it back to buy some more BTC at $6,000 because you believe in the technology and you've seen it recover so many times in the past. Sure enough, it goes back up to $12,000 in 6 months and you get uneasy again.
Swapping in and out of BTC to lock in your gains after each rise generates taxable events. Swapping between BTC and fiat vs BTC and ETH is no different.
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:42:42
Indeed. I wanted to give more detail when explaining the purpose of main vs split. Main is where your BCH landed when the fork happened and you need to send your balances from the Main view to the Split view in order to safely separate them.

Don't let the year 2140 fool you. Coin creation is going to slow down so much that the final 10 BTC will start to be mined in 2085. So many people focus on the end of new coins and don't realize that it will be a trickle of new BTC for decades before that.

That's just a different vehicle. Getting out of BTC in any form is taxable event if you made any gain while you held it. Crypto to crypto or crypto to fiat doesn't matter. You can't bounce around between cryptos and think you can escape a tax bill by not selling for cash. 
Even if you buy something like a car with BTC that increased in value while you held it, you will still be responsible for the gains at tax time.

**So are you saying I have to report every thing I buy with Bitcoin?**
Yes, if your country's tax authority has determined that gains are made when disposing of Bitcoins, like in the US for example.
**What about if I bought some Ethereum or Litecoin?**
Potentially another tax event. Think of it as selling Bitcoins back to cash, then buying your other coins with that. That sale might have gains, and so is treated the same way.
**How are the IRS treating Bitcoins?**
The IRS produed guidance in 2014 on the specific treatment of Bitcoins and other crypto-currencies, which has helped clarified the situation. Essentially:
* Bitcoin is a personal property, not a currency, and so is taxed as a capital asset
* Gains made from converting Bitcoins into a fiat currency are subject to capital gains tax
* Purchases of goods or services with Bitcoins must also account for gains
[Back to me]
Just because that last section says cashing out to fiat is taxable doesn't mean **only** cashing out to fiat is taxable. The very next line reads purchasing **goods** or services with BTC is also taxable. Those goods may include a different coin.
When you buy **anything** using BTC that went up in value while you held it, that is a taxable event.

There is no "public address". The public key is cryptographically related to the private key. The public key is hashed in two different ways to create a Bitcoin address. The public key participates in the validation of the signature applied by the private key and is therefore never exposed until you spend or sign a message.
We are still decades away from being able to reverse a public key into a private key, but the risk is there. Bruce Schneier said many years ago to stay away from public key cryptography that uses elliptic curve. That will come home to roost in the form of quantum computing.

If you're asking if the miners will still mine, it's all about the fees. Fees attached to each transaction have always been awarded to miners in addition to the block reward. The plan has always been to have the value of each swap places -- as the block reward drops over time, the miners will still receive the same payout thanks to an increase in the transaction fees.

Hard to believe we're still seeing mixed answers to this question. No, it is not taxable when you move it to your wallet. You still own the asset. It is only taxable if you had gains when cashing out to fiat or swapping to another crypto and don't have corresponding losses to counter your gains.
There are two different rates you pay in the US. A higher rate if you stayed in the coin for less than a year and a lower rate if you held onto it for a year or longer. So many people (incorrectly) believe it is only taxable when you sell it for fiat.

Balances in Bitcoin addresses that have never been used in a prior spend or (update: whose private key was used) to digitally sign a message are quantum safe. HD wallets automatically transfer unspent balances to brand new Bitcoin addresses as part of every spend.

I have some wallets that I loaded in early '15 and haven't touched. Also, check out page 4 of the Bitcoin Rich List. There's a pocket of 3,000 BTC addresses that show deposits occurring from 2011 to 2015, most of which never had any withdrawals. Each one is currently worth $57MM. Counting the top row of page 5, there are 20 addresses with 3,000 BTC and no withdrawals.
That's $228MM in 20 rows. Do you really think all of those are lost because a few years have gone by without deposits or withdrawals? If you could get 1,000 BTC per week in the very early days, that's a summer of GPU mining right there, now worth a quarter of a billion dollars.

Check out Electrum on the TAILS  bootable OS. In its safest configuration, TAILS forgets EVERYTHING each time you shut it down. So when you setup Electrum, be sure to write down your 12 or 13 words when they tell you to. Next time you boot up, you will restore your seed by reentering those 12 or 13 words. All of your Bitcoin addresses and transaction history will come back.
During the time that TAILS is not booted with Electrum configured, you can know that there are no devices on Earth configured to access your balances. Even the piece of paper with your 12 or 13 words isn't going to help you unless you use those words to regain access to your millions of addresses and transaction history. 
Finally, if you take it a step further and memorize your words (in the proper order), you can feel even safer knowing that there isn't even a piece of paper out there with the words written on it that will help you regain access to your balances. Nobody can do anything with your balances unless and until you boot up TAILS and reenter the words corresponding to your addresses and balances.
Finally (for real), you can always either get a new word list within seconds and start the process all over again or you can start a new unique sequence of millions of addresses also based on that same word list. With the right tools, you can create some incredibly safe scenarios. Don't worry about computers crashing -- done right, you don't need computers.

Remember, if you buy and spend immediately, the BTC you held had little chance to rise in value, thus never triggering a taxable event.
You only need to keep track of when you bought, how much you bought, what price you paid per BTC at purchase and all the same info when you spent. Start a new wallet each time you buy BTC so there's no risk of blending them.

"American" instead of US will annoy some people since not all citizens of the Americas are from the US. Also, I was a bit surprised that you didn't appear to list some form of pure Bitcoin as an alternative payment option. You listed BitPay and Coinbase but not Mycelium or BreadWallet for instance. Businesses are not forced to route inbound payments through a processor such as those listed. More specifically, you asked how many Bitcoin transactions we've executed in the last one month and then asked which alternative payment systems we used over the last 3 months. Since you didn't count pure Bitcoin transactions as an alternative payment option, perhaps you should have specified "NOT including payment processors such as BitPay or Coinbase" in the earlier question. People will likely include payments processed through a processor in their Bitcoin transaction count since that question comes up before the question asking if we've used BItPay (among others) in the last three months. We're spending Bitcoin even when paying through BitPay. The business may or may not be accepting Bitcoin, but we're spending it. Also, I don't recall seeing Gyft or similar systems where you buy gift cards for hundreds of stores using Bitcoin.

Serious question I've been wanting to ask for a while. How do you see these large institutions using the blockchain without really getting into bitcoin? Do you agree that a single satoshi can represent anything from a list detailing ownership of one or more physical or virtual objects? or perhaps be the incarnation of a smart contract? When you say they are inseparable, do you mean at a technical level that you cannot have one without the other, or do you feel that larger investments in the currency side of Bitcoin are required in order to participate in the ecosystem?
In my view, Bitcoin will end up with at least two very different groups of uses and users. There will be the huge institutions that are regularly attaching ownership and contracts to individual satoshis (meaning very little actual cash tied up in BTC) and "end users" like us using it like a currency. The institutions will get the immutable record for free on the backs of the miners and the end users will end up financing the whole thing with miner's fees. In that regard, I agree that they cannot be separated. However, if a huge institution can track ownership of 100 million items (each of which may in turn be DATABASES full of items!) for $228 ATM, then I also feel like their involvement in the currency side of the ecosystem will be negligible to the point of effectively non-existent. 
Do you focus on the fact that they cannot be unlinked technically or do you feel that the huge institutions will somehow be required to make huge investments on the currency side in order to enjoy the benefits of the blockchain? IMO of course they can't be separated, but they can also do all the stuff they want to do in the blockchain using some of the cash in the cafeteria lady's pocket.

I was bound to get a comment either way. I wanted to keep the example simple by returning to BTC in the end and could have picked any coin or token in the middle. 
And yes on joinmarket as well, certainly.

In case you haven't been following developments, they added the ability to use for your phone for secure 2FA back in January. Also the device protects your transactions from malware, so long as the device is initialized on a clean PC. So if you think your friends' PCs are virtual petri dishes but yours are clean, they can pick up a Nano or HW.1 and bring it to you for setup. Initializing it sets it up for operation but doesn't tie it to your PC. They are then free to use it on any PC that runs Chrome, no matter what the malware situation. Their devices even act as secure tokens for logging into websites, with an API so any website can add support.
I generally prefer it over Trezor thanks to the EMV chip, the fact that it doesn't require a USB cable to connect to the PC and that it fits on my keychain. I'm in hotels 50 weeks a year, and I don't have to worry one bit about someone getting to my Nano while I'm away on a business trip, because it's right there in my pocket. I'm a 20+ year Linux guy so I totally get the Open Source vs proprietary discussion. The Ledger performs a self check at every power up and warns you if the firmware has been altered by someone other than Ledger. Very nice all the way around. Stick it in any PC with Chrome, install the extension and enter your PIN. Just like with the Trezor, if it is not inserted into a USB port, then it cannot sign transactions which is what you want. All the security, 1/5th the price.

If you're looking for someone to defend chip and signature, there's no way you're going to find it in me. I also think it's ridiculous. 
That being said, search YouTube for "chip pin hacked" to see how easily it can be defeated with the right pin pads. There are plenty of people who say the chip and pin implementation is far from godlike and also needs to be redone. I just want anything that's better than mag stripe and signature.
If I can somehow get a card that will also work in Europe, that would be great, too. Without changing banks? Impossible. 
@_date: 2015-06-03 10:08:13
Please understand the US standard is not Chip and PIN. It is Chip and Signature, although a few cards are being configured to also support Chip and PIN in order to work overseas. There may be a merchant here or there who support Chip and PIN in the US, but that is not the standard being rolled out. 
Head on over to to learn a lot more about it. Most importantly, as this letter points out, whichever party (the bank, merchant or customer) has not upgraded by October will bear the responsibility for fraudulent payments after that point. That event is being called "the liability shift".

Have you read The Cyphernomicon? It was somewhere between a FAQ and a bible for the group where Satoshi was born. I was reading that newsgroup at the time the document was written. If nothing, it is interesting to go back and see what kinds of things people were devising way back when. What they saw in the future. This was some of the stuff we were talking about before half of today's Redditors were born.
It's a long, disjointed read, but there are some pretty cool nuggets in there. I think it should be in the sidebar or wiki.

My bank recently deactivated my cards right in the middle of a business trip because I didn't pick up my mail frequently enough, and some paperwork was returned to them. I have "Do not send me mail" checked on every settings page I can find on the site.

That was definitely a "Bitcoin users not affected" situation for me.

I've had two successful buys out of four tries. First place had dropped the QPay Network a year earlier. Second try went perfectly. The girl at the third place (a T-Mobile store) said her boss "only lets [her] process payments for T-Mobile on that screen". I drove 10 minutes down the road to the next place and it went smoothly. 
If you are the first customer at a given location, email the support team to tell them how it went and they will send you an extra $5 worth. If you buy the minimum $50, that's like getting Bitstamp MINUS 10% pricing! Can't get that on LBC. They even paid me $5 when I told them about the first place that wasn't valid anymore. 
You're right, though. If you have one somewhat nearby, it's hard to beat. Instant transfers, no or low fees (sometimes negative fees!), great customer service, minimal KYC. I really like them, but mainly because they're easy to find near my work and vacation spots. Closest one to home is over 20 mins away now, so that stinks a little. Try to find one in NJ, though.

Nice write-up, but I think you mean "who owes whom" each time you wrote "owns". You are establishing a channel through which multiple parties may send a stream of transactions, and when the channel is closed only the final amount that needs to move to represent the final outcome of all those transactions is actually moved on the blockchain. 
@_date: 2015-06-11 13:50:01
Thank you for your response, I appreciate it. If I understand you correctly, it will be in the best interest of the large institutions to invest in mining to further enhance the security of the blockchain. That definitely makes sense if they're going to start using it to permanently record their activities. Additionally, the monetary value of bitcoin the currency will drive investment in mining. Finally, if the large institutions would consider using it as a currency, they will eventually move their payment activities off of fiat to BTC in order to make use of the dual capabilities -- ownership and smart contracts along with currency transfer.
I guess I feel like the institutions want nothing to do with holding or using BTC as a currency at this point and will be perfectly happy letting us use it the way we see fit. It's monopoly money to them. I think investigating blockchain is a way to dip a toe in the water vs jumping in head first. The holy grail to them is the free (or nearly free) access to a perfectly trustable and immutable database. They absolutely do not care one bit about the fluctuating price -- only that the network is still operating as planned. As soon as they have to get into the mining game it suddenly becomes much less valuable to them. Especially if all that investment is leading to something as intangible as improved security. As an Enterprise IT Architect, I can talk about tangible improvements to security all day. But at some point, there's a crossover between how much they need to spend and how much safety they expect to gain from those investments.
What are the chances that someone that will execute a 51% attack and try to steal BTC? Wouldn't that pull the rug out and reduce the value of all BTC across the board to zero at this point? Even if the chances of that happening are non-zero, how much do we expect institutions to invest to prevent that from happening? Do you think they will ever understand the ROI of protecting against the possibility of this happening? Also, is there a point at which they would realize that a heavy investment will help everyone and not just themselves? Do we expect them to do good for the world instead of just themselves? Do we expect them to pass on any savings in operational costs on to us by moving key functions to the blockchain, or do we think they're going to claim it's a wash against the new mining costs? And if they start mining, what do we expect them to do with the BTC they mine? Use it for billions of spots on the blockchain? If each BTC can be used to manage say, 20 to 100 million databases then they only need to mine one BTC a month to get enough spots for their typical use. Especially if they just transfer the BTC within their own accounts, attaching content and smart contracts. This points back to the fact that they don't have to care one iota about the exchange rate at any given moment -- just that the network is still operating.
It sounds like your long term view may be much further out than mine or where VCs are operating today. I just don't see the major institutions increasing hashing power to improve the security of the blockchain, nor using BTC to transfer value in a significant way for a long time. I can see the world's 10 largest banks offering gimmicks to customers, such as low fee bank accounts that claim to use the blockchain for asset management or even customer-to-customer crypto transfers. I don't see anything preventing your current view of the future eventually coming to be, but I do see a decade or more in between their first forays into the blockchain and investing in mining to improve the security for everyone. I also don't know if I ever see the biggest ones moving from fiat to BTC for transfer of value. They are just too entrenched.
My experience draws upon 20 years in IT from individual through large enterprise infrastructure design and back end trade processing for (one of?) the world's largest insurance company before that. I've seen many billions of dollars' worth of all different kinds of investment vehicles move and designed some global scale datacenter IT infrastructures. Only 20 months with Bitcoin and blockchain technology (but its not really that complicated at the user level). Thanks again for explaining your view. I appreciate it.

You may have rejected the suggestion too quickly. If you have an SSN, that sounds like you're in the US. LibertyX takes cash only at thousands of retailers nationwide and doesn't check ID at time of purchase. You just need to be truthful when signing up. Also, seems to have mastered the art of selling BTC via bank deposit. You coordinate a buy with him beforehand, bring cash to any branch of one of several big name US banks and deposit the agreed amount into his account. You don't need an account at that bank and again, the bank doesn't check ID when making a deposit. It's not quite instant, but it doesn't take days like many of the big name exchanges you see around here. Not all LocalBitcoins merchants work that way but he's been advertising his services for quite a while.
Those are two options right there that turn cash into BTC without photographing or presenting your ID to anyone.

One 'L'. Mycelium. It's a smartphone app on Android and iOS, although the two versions are ENTIRELY different from one another, built by entirely independent development teams. On the Android version, go to Accounts, click on your wallet name (usually the date you set it up unless you rename it), then click the three dots in the top right corner to bring up the menu and click Sign Message. Enter your PIN, type in the message you want to guarantee came from you and click "Sign Message". Then click Copy to Clipboard or any other app that allows you to save or send text content.
This isn't normally how you "protect your account" after buying stuff on BitcoinTalk, though. What are you really trying to achieve? Are you trying to prove that you are the one who writes all content posted from your account?

Don't ignore the Ledger line of products. Both use the same smart chip technology that has protected bank card transactions around the world for nearly two decades. The Nano has beefier packaging and fits beautifully on a keychain while the HW.1 is bare bones and is barely the size of the EMV chip itself. 
The Nano can be had for about $40 US and the HW.1 just over half that. Both are impressive devices that offer the highest levels of security at very effective prices. I like having my Nano in my close proximity at all times. I have no connection to Ledger other than as a happy customer.

Came here to suggest the same. They partnered with "Check Cashing" type small retailers across the country. After signing up online, you go to a [location]( and ask to pay a bill on the QPay Network. When they ask which payee do you want to pay, say LibertyX. They'll ask you how much do you want to pay in $50 increments between $50 and $300, and they may say it's cash only. Tell them how much, give them the cash and they'll give you a receipt.
Next go to your phone's Bitcoin wallet and copy your public address to the clipboard. Switch over to your browser and bring up to the [store]( section of the website. Sign in and click "Redeem a PIN". Enter the PIN on the receipt and paste in your Bitcoin address copied from your wallet. The transfer should start immediately.
I poked around various areas of IL and, as would be expected, there's a higher concentration of available locations in the northeastern part of the state. There are also a ton of locations in and around St. Louis if you're near the far southwestern corner. Not much else between St. Louis and Naperville, though, but I guess that could be expected knowing the geography.

Looks like you already have your answer, but the person wanting to verify your identity should also learn about digital signatures. There are ways to mathematically prove that you are able to spend from a specific address without requiring you to transfer any balances. If you do adopt that system, be sure to include the name by which they know you (or a specific term or phrase they want you to use) within the text that is guaranteed to be unaltered in transit.

Sure they can. They'll just buy as many $50, $100 or $300 PINs they need to get them to or over the amount they need in BTC. Up to $1,000 a day or $2,500 a week. You're not limited to one PIN per day. Bring a couple friends and they can buy within $50 of the amount they need, up to $3,000 worth all in the same visit on the same day. The friends don't even need to be there to buy the PINs -- its cash only and the stores don't care. They buyers only need enough legitimate userids to redeem all of the PINs.
At worst they end up with an extra $49 in BTC. It's nowhere near as limiting as someone led you to believe.

I read too much into this content then.

Segwit and Lightning Network are designed to bring back the old speed of the network as well as the low fees for users (much to the chagrin of miners). Search YouTube for intro videos to those topics and see what impacts they should have on adoption and the end user experience. 
As an example, I would set aside $500 that I know I will gradually spend at my supermarket. That will open a channel for us to have a series of instantaneous transactions, all at near 0 fee. At the end, I'll close the channel and commit everything I've spent with them in one transaction, freeing up any portion of the original $500 for my use.

I've been a geek since the early 80s. Was coding in assembler in high school. Had already been online for a year before AOL got TCP/IP in the 90s. *I was on USENET in the crypto groups when the Cypherpunks Manifesto was published.* First installed Linux in '94. I had a 5 digit uid on Slashdot. And yet, somehow I completely missed the birth of Bitcoin. I was too wrapped up in work or something. 
Either way, it took my 60 year old mother in law asking me about it after it appeared in the New Yorker right around November '13 for me to learn about it. I'm still shocked at how I completely missed it. If it came out ten years earlier, I had racks of unused equipment in a data center I could have easily setup for a small mining operation and earned a few to several thousand BTC before anyone would have cared.

I recently explained it to a 67 year old permanently flat broke hippie. I explained that it is a universal currency for the planet, not issued or controlled by any government. I described how easy it is to move balances between any two entities on Earth, free of all restrictions.
She got it almost immediately, but she quickly arrived at, "so you don't have to pay taxes on it!!" / "No, it is taxed the same way stocks, bonds and other property like works of art are taxed. If it goes up in value between the time you acquired it and the time you spent or sold it, you must notify the IRS and pay them their share of the gains you made at tax time. But if you buy it and spend it immediately at or below the price you paid for it, you never have to notify or pay the IRS."
Being permanently dead broke, it was obvious she never faced a tax burden for selling stocks or bonds and definitely not for works of art. She got the concept pretty quickly, though. I wasn't trying to lead her into buying any, it just came up as part of the "salon" type roundtable discussions we normally have at my in-laws.

You may also show her the Bitcoin series on Khan Academy. Or if she wants REALLY dry material, the Senate hearings and the NY Dept of Financial Services (NYDFS). Those last two are showing how federal and state governments are shaping their regulations around Bitcoin's use, most definitely not dismissing them as illegal by any stretch. Finally, the Congressional Research Service is a publication service of the US Congress. They develop reports for members of Congress when lawmakers want to understand a particular topic. The reports are usually very short (5-20 pages) and are designed to help a reasonably educated person understand the important facets of a big topic. Below is an analysis of (and link to) a 2015 report that CRS developed for Congress to help them understand Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
As others have said, don't use it to perform an illegal act and you're not breaking the law. Possessing and spending Bitcoin just by itself is not illegal. It also does not change the legality of what you're buying with it. A cup of coffee is still just a cup of coffee while a bag of weed is still a bag of weed. The best thing you can do is not push her on it. Show her the Khan Academy videos and give her a copy of the CRS report. Let her learn about it and she'll realize that the rest of the world only tends to hear about the bad stuff that people try to do with it and how they get caught. If she wants to learn more, show her the FinCEN rulings and the IRS guidance. Would the IRS tell you how to report how much money you made on it if it was illegal to own or spend? ~~Of course not.~~ They would, but as Daffy Duck says, "It's a neat trick, but I can only do it once."
Which actually brings me to this. If she comes around and doesn't mind you holding onto it or spending some here and there, keep REALLY GOOD records of each time you acquire or buy some, including the date, how much you received valued in US dollars and when you sell or spend some later on, how much you spent or sold, the date you spent or sold it, its value in US dollars and how much the BTC that you just spent or sold went up or down in value while you held onto it. This is very important to do in the US and may not make it worth it to ever spend any. Remember, you don't have to tell anyone about any BTC you've received no matter how or why you received it -- only when you sell or spend some and only if it went up in value while you held onto it.
I keep every BTC purchase in a separate HD wallet so it is easy for me to figure out the value when I bought it vs when I sold or spent it. If you buy or receive BTC periodically and put it all into the same wallet (either paper or HD), you will find it is difficult to identify which BTC you sold or spent when you sell or spend more than your most recent purchase had left on it. When every purchase is paired up with its own sales in a single HD wallet, you can easily document how much you paid for each BTC and how much it was worth as you eventually spent or sold all of it -- even if you didn't spend it all at once. Don't just jump into buying a bunch at different times and putting it all into the same HD wallet, that is a nightmare waiting to happen.

Use the search to read about Bitsim.co and the Ledger Trustlet.
Bitsim is a shim that sits between your SIM card and the slot contacts. Your phone has the ability to securely interact with and display output from software running on a SIM card. The Bitsim runs secure wallet software and interacts with the phone and user via that secure path. By sitting between the phone and the actual SIM card, it is able to use the SIM card to provide an external connection. It uses specially crafted SMS messages to communicate with the outside world, so you don't even need a smartphone to use it. 
Ledger is working on a software implementation of their Nano hardware wallet. It runs on the TrustSonic Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) built into a small number of handsets. Those guys are constantly innovating.

I suggest reading history and reaching out to them for more details. You need to be able to prove (to their satisfaction, not yours) how long you held your BTC if you're looking to reduce your capital gains taxes. Of course if you're down then you don't have any gains to tax. Don't blend your short term and long term BTC in the same address.
When we went through all this chat at the end of last year and tax time this year, a common suggestion was to keep long term holdings on paper and short term in a hot wallet to avoid tainting your long term holdings with fresh coin.
Of course it was a different context last year in terms of whether you're up or down. A lot more people had to care about getting it right last year. If what you spent went down this year, there's nothing to do unless you want to use it to offset gains elsewhere.

Might be easier to build one. Look for a Maker video from the guy who built a digital piggy bank for his kid. Had a real coin slot linked to an Arduino that detected the coins being inserted. Had a digital display that temporarily flashed the value of the coin inserted and then the total balance in the bank. 
Does T-Mobile still give out free data only SIM cards good for 200MB a month? I'm sure you can build something that will accept coins and load an address before spitting out a paper wallet when the user clicks "Done" or "Print". You would need an Arduino, a Pi, a cash register printer (or higher quality paper like the Piper) and to customize the Piper software (I believe it's open source).

Interesting read, similar to what IBM produces on a periodic basis. It even reads the same way. I wonder if they hired us to develop it. Somewhat unexpected from Ford, but I guess if there's anyone who needs to invest in understanding upcoming trends, it's a car company. I wonder what they think about how their products will intersect with Bitcoin. When will the bill at a drive through show up on our navigation screens, allowing us to click a "Pay Now" button?
Also, I thought it was interesting how they lumped Bitcoin into the little teaser question at the end about the price of  giving up privacy for convenience. There are many who say Bitcoin is not and can never be truly anonymous. There are others who will show you how to make significant improvements in privacy with crypto. Or was Ford's question meant to point to a double edge sword? Are they suggesting that not only is there a cost of privacy for all this convenience but that there is also the cost of security when moving to semi-anonymous, or pseudonymous digital currency?
Does Ford somehow believe that Gen Z not only does not understand what they have given up by selling their soul to Facebook, but may also not foresee the consequences of adopting a borderless currency that operates outside the confines and manipulation of central banks? That's a pretty deep thought for a car company.

Not necessarily. Make the BIP-38 encrypted wallets easy to find. If you have three kids, make a pass phrase out of their middle names and birthdates in YYYYDDMM format strung together in the order of their birth. Just have the DMS send out the instructions, not the actual passphrase. That's a pretty easy way to make a strong passphrase you don't have to share. You could even mix it up and have the names and birthdates appear in a different order on each paper wallet, leaving it up to them to figure out the sequence to unlock the money. It's not like you're locked out of the wallet after X number of failed tries.


Well, my brain does that sometimes. :) I am named on four patents, so stuff like that just pops into my head out of the blue.

It's in the subreddit FAQ. The reward will gradually be supplemented and eventually replaced by the transaction fees attached to nearly every transaction. 
My concern is that the reward is halving due to the arms race in hashing power before the transaction volume gets there to make up for the lower reward.

While the designs look great, best practice says to never spend from the same address twice, unless the second spend is to transfer the entire remaining balance to a new address whose spend address has never been seen by an Internet-connected device. Get a new private key after every spend transaction.
Now if the cryptocards showed a BIP-38 encrypted list of seed words for a deterministic wallet, now you're getting somewhere. But all that for an address you should only spend from once? That's a bit over the top IMHO.
@_date: 2014-06-06 12:57:12
OP was in a crowded bar and people came over to help right away. I would have felt comfortable there. I'm not sure why so many people are suggesting doing it at a bank. We don't have cops in my bank lobby, and if I start making a ruckus about getting robbed all the tellers are going to do is slam down that bulletproof glass so they don't get involved.
Maybe the people saying "do it at a bank" really mean to involve the teller in part of the transaction. You withdraw cash from the teller so the seller knows it's not counterfeit. You hand the cash over and execute the BTC transfer right at the counter. Of course, now that banks are closing accounts when they find BTC related activity, I'm not sure I'd want to do it that way either.
If you both bank there, you can also hand the teller two different slips with your account numbers written on them and the balance to transfer. Once that's complete, you do the BTC transfer before leaving the teller. And then the bank closes both your accounts after you leave and they saw what you were doing :)
I'm beginning to agree with the people who suggest doing it in or in front of a police station. You have to walk around yelling "hellooo?!!" in my podunk police station, though. All this points to is why I'd rather get a TM4 and buy $100 in BTC every month through my electric company.

A few months ago I asked what it would take to earn $15,000 profit per month. I was told $135,000 to start in miners and $60,000 in new miners every three months. And you would basically need to host the gear somewhere in Eastern Washington State for the best electricity rates.
Check the FAQ for a list of mining calculators. They are there to help you figure this all out. Just make sure you get good numbers to use for hashers. Some calculators show 2 TH/s at 1600 watts for the TerraMiner IV when it's actually 1.6 TH/s at 2100 watts, so don't trust the built in figures.

See, now you got me thinking. Instead of specifying the lotto ticket numbers, just buy a page of randomly picked tickets and spell out passwords by correlating the number to the number of the letter in the alphabet. Any numbers above 26 (English, of course) either get ignored or get entered as a space (or alternate by line on the ticket).
Then the worthless lotto tickets can sit in the firebox with the BIP38 paper wallets and no one would have any idea what it's about until the instructions come out in the will. You don't even have to buy the tickets.. just scoop up the losing tickets people leave behind on the floor or counter and use the numbers to spell out passwords.

"Other than selfish or altruistic"? I'm not sure there are any reasons that wouldn't fall into either of those two categories. You're either doing it for yourself or for others, right? How about both? When you mine, you improve the integrity of the system for everyone, but you also get paid to do it. You currently have to pay more to start mining than you will ever earn by mining, but it's a (small?) price to pay to keep this alive for everyone.
As for me, I'm basically just looking to use my electric company as an exchange. Instead of setting up buys, I'd rather pay my electric company $x and receive the same in BTC each month. Any equipment costs will replace the markup fees charged by sellers in face-to-face sales.
In other words, I'd gladly spend $2,000 if I knew that a miner would cover the increase in my electric bill for 2 years.

Have you ever had anyone question the randomness of wallets you're giving them? Or do you make sure they sweep the balance as soon as you give it to them?
If you showed up with a paper wallet for me containing just the balance I was buying, I would want to make sure the balance was sitting there for a while with several confirmations before I believed you couldn't disrupt the transfer.
@_date: 2014-07-01 06:25:50
For $200, you could have purchased a Piper offline paper wallet generator. About the size of a tissue box, the unit safely generates offline paper wallets at the press of a button. The paper is rated to retain images for 20 years and the device can be configured to remember or forget the keys that it generates. It can also support other cryptos and use BIP38 encryption. 
With an unlimited supply of safely generated paper wallets, paired up with an app like Mycelium that lets you spend directly from QR codes without importing the wallets, you could literally keep your money offline until the moment you need to spend it. 
Sorry for your losses. You seem to be taking it well, but that would be a ton of money to many people.
@_date: 2014-12-05 01:38:01
Help me understand, guys. Best I can tell by watching Trezor videos is that the private keys never leave the device. Transactions are requested by their web wallet, sent via USB to the Trezor, where the payment is constructed, signed and then sent back to the web wallet for processing. 
How are you supposed to do this in a coffee shop? I know you can connect and use USB devices on Android phones, so is that how it works? Does the mobile app know how to request payments, send the requests to the Trezor over USB and then broadcast the signed transaction returned via USB?
I currently think scanning QR codes on encrypted paper wallets with Mycelium is the safest way to spend from cold storage when you're not at home, but I want to like and appreciate the Trezor. I feel like I don't get it yet whenever I see it hooked up by USB. 
@_date: 2014-06-12 13:46:48
Both on Android: With Blockchain, start the app, click the down arrow next to the word "Blockchain" up top and choose "Scan Private Key". Scan the "Spend" QR and you will be asked to enter the passphrase that was used to encrypt it. Blockchain will not import an empty paper wallet, so you'll have to send a little to it before importing it.
With Mycelium, start the app and switch to the Keys tab. Click the key with the plus in the top right corner and choose "Scan". Scan the encrypted "Spend" QR and enter the passphrase to unlock it and press the "Decrypt" button. You will be asked to name the paper wallet, and the app suggests today's date as the label.
Note that with Mycelium, you can also spend right from a paper wallet without importing it first. When you go to spend, just click "Scan" and scan the "Spend" QR. The developers swear all data required to spend from that paper wallet are deleted from your phone immediately after the spend is issued. The TFH crowd doesn't believe it for a second.
For the purpose of this thread and discussion, though, I'd suggest you scan the "life insurance" paper wallets as "Watch Only Addresses" and add their "Load" address to your frequently used address book. That way, if you lose or someone steals your phone, they can't drain your kids' paper wallets, yet you can continue to make deposits right from your phone whenever you like. As stated above, if you instruct your lawyer to give out the instructions upon your death, no one can spend the money (not even you, if you didn't scan the "Spend" QR before giving it to your lawyer) until that time arrives.

Central to the whole process is that a) the private keys never leave the device, and because of that, b) the transactions are constructed on the device and transmitted to the network by the connected PC.
The user needs to enter a passcode shown on the Trezor in order to complete the transaction. There is nothing that can happen on the PC or the website that would enable an attacker to start emptying the addresses without entering passcodes shown only on the device.

Are you able to specify and document which address is to hold specific bitcoin and which one is to be used for spending? Or does it hide all those details from you? I ask because at this time of year, people are getting their tax paperwork together.
If you spent any bitcoin that increased more than 50c while you held it, you are responsible to pay taxes on the money you made by holding it. If you can prove that you held the BTC in an address for longer than a year, then your tax bill goes down on those gains. And it can be a significant discount when you prove when and where you held it. But if all the BTC just gets jumbled up together in a series of new addresses, you may not be able to prove how long you held the BTC before spending it. There was a good reason for keeping it in the paper wallet if it was a large sum and gained value while it sat there.

BTC replaces the good faith of the government to pay its bills with the good faith of Bitcoin users to exchange BTC back into fiat or exchange it for goods and services. It is the users' faith in the network that gives each BTC unit its value. I think that is the "thing" you are looking for. The faith that at the core of the distributed ledger, balances cannot be molested, frozen or stolen no matter what.

Wouldn't it be interesting if they presented the FBI with the physical media and a full accounting for the uploads? They obviously are still violating copyright laws, but wow that would be an interesting scene. 
What if every downloader tipped Taylor Swift directly via Twitter, saying they prefer she gets all the proceeds? Do you think her attorneys or the record company lawyers are already working on updating her contract to account for that possibility? Would they demand she forward the payments to them?
Some celebrities and sports legends charge for autographs. How about tipping them via Twitter from the line or when you get to the table?

My only tweak to your advice is to delete the NIC from the VM config.

You still need to choose your accounting method. What I learned from is that you can assign a different capital gains rate to different wallets - I thought the clock (held &lt;366 days vs held 366+ days) applied across all your holdings. An easy way to keep them separate is to keep long term BTC (366+ days) on paper before spending it and keep your short term BTC (&lt;366 days) in a hot wallet such as your phone.
Check out this analysis for choosing the accounting method. This is actually in the middle of a very comprehensive document.

You know what really bumped up my understanding of the concepts? Go to bitaddress.org, and generate a key by typing random keys into the text field while moving the mouse. Once the counter drops to zero, click Paper Wallet. You'll see three graphics that look like a Bitcoin version of paper Euros. Print out the page and neatly cut the bills out of the paper. Finally, fold them horizontally so that the "Spend" code is hidden behind the "Load &amp; Verify" code. You now have three wallets (with zero balances).
Looking at them, studying them and holding them should help you understand how each wallet is analogous to two different things -- first, each wallet is like a new bank account, but the paper works like an ATM. The code on the left is how you deposit funds and check the balance in the account. The code on the right lets you spend money out of the account (like swiping  your debit card).
**Note:** The common advice is to completely empty a paper wallet the first time you spend any of it using the Spend QR code.
My plan is to spread 10-20 BTC out over 20 or more laminated paper wallets and stick them in my fire box for a decade or two. While the long term holdings are building in value, I'll buy and spend BTC for everyday expenses using my cell phone wallet. When it's time to start spending the paper wallets, I'll grab one from the fire box, empty it into my hot wallet, and print out and laminate some fresh paper wallets. Remember, don't transfer half the balance to a hot wallet and return the laminated card to the fire box -- transfer the entire balance. You must assume that as soon as you scan the Spend QR code, people are out there trying to get at it. Hopefully the BTC I just pulled out of the fire box will be worth so much that I will need to split up that balance across 19 new paper wallets, leaving only 1/20th of the original paper wallet balance in my hot wallet. You never need to scan the Spend QR code in order to put a balance on the new paper wallets, so I'll just sprinkle some value across the new slips and lock them away in the box with the 19 original slips I loaded up 10 years earlier. That's a great way to slowly spend your BTC in retirement (assuming you stored enough originally and it has gone up enough over time).
The other way to think of it is as if it's like a dollar bill in your wallet right now, except you get to decide how much it's worth. That's why there's no value written on it. Suppose (in the Bitcoin future) you want to tip a server at a restaurant. You leave USD in the bill fold to pay the bill, but for the tip you remove an empty paper wallet from your (leather) wallet, pull up Mycelium on your cellphone, click "Send" in the app, then "Scan" and aim the camera at the "Load &amp; Verify" code on the paper wallet. Enter the tip in the app and execute the transfer. You can now leave the paper wallet behind, thus giving the tip directly to the server without ever having to scan their QR code or do some awkward transaction with their personal cell phone. Of course, the smart thing for them to do would be to carefully open the (taped closed) paper wallet and immediately scan the Spend side and empty the paper wallet into their hot wallet on their phone. Then they can throw away the (now empty) paper wallet because it's empty and it's Spend code "is tainted" (it has been seen by an Internet-connected device). The paper wallet will only hold value for the three minutes it sat on the table waiting for the server to pick it up and empty into their own hot wallet.
Think of a world where the paper money in our wallets would be worthless to pickpockets because all the paper has no value until moments before you hand it to someone else. Wouldn't that be nice?
**Note:** Some people freak out at the thought of handing over paper wallets that you printed. Just be honest about it and tape the paper wallet closed with the Spend code hidden as soon as possible after printing it out. I've actually seen someone write "tipping a waiter when you've seen the Spend code is worthless". I disagree and I have a more positive view of the world. Perhaps servers will make stickers out of their "Load &amp; Verify" code and stick them on the inside of their bill carriers with "Tip Nancy" or "Tip Dave" as a caption. Their phone will vibrate the instant you tip them while you're still sitting at the table. Pretty cool.
I've also encouraged Bob Evans to print a one-off QR code at the bottom of every bill. Then we can pay right from the table without standing in line. Maybe take it up front to have the cashier scan it to make sure the register shows the bill as paid before letting us leave. So many possibilities come to mind once you grasp some of the concepts -- especially the purpose of the QR codes and how impossible it is to ever see the same one get generated twice (without some hackery going on).
Go ahead. Print out some wallets. Also, and I'm still learning this part, you can practice transferring BTC in and out using "testnet". You're not actually moving any value of course, but you can get the full experience. It worked for me.

Don't tipbot and other services perform off-chain transactions? You should be able to load up an account with the parking agency. Also, more and more cities are replacing meters at each spot with a payment box in each block. Easy to cover 50 spots with each box and a cellular connection. Then all you need is for the parking authority to keep track of the expiration times for each spot and notify the meter maid when a spot is about to expire. That tells them where to go next to get ready to issue a parking ticket.
The real bastard move is the sensing meter that erases the time on the clock when a car pulls out of a spot. The things some agencies will do for money.

I think the third option you missed is that we don't want to have to choose to ignore the regulations applied to a portion of the bitcoin industry.
The more I hear about the proposed regulatory framework, the more they sound to me like the people here who declare that the feds got it all wrong and that Bitcoin is a currency, not property. Just as boisterous, just as inaccurate and embarrassing themselves by continuing to shout regarding topics they should not be shouting. 
So yes, it will be easy to ignore the regulations or work around them by shunning New Yorkers, but it may not be the smartest move to make. Yes, Bitcoin can be regulated by state and federal agencies, but they can also easily be ignored if someone chooses to go down that path.

I envision a future where cash registers will display on the customer facing screen a QR code with a payment amount encoded within. Then a customer with a phone would scan the QR and authorize the suggested payment.
I, too, was thinking of sending your kids to the store with a paper wallet loaded with pocket change, but that wouldn't work too well in the scenario I described above. Either your kid or the cashier would need to scan the Spend QR, but the customer-facing touch screen would then need to switch to a keyboard so your kid could enter the BIP38 password.
Last but not least, I give an old deactivated phone to my cousin's kid every couple of years and she runs it off WiFi. If your kid took a similar phone to the store and the store had WiFi, then my first suggested use case scenario would work fine. Similarly, if you're in the store with your kid, you can just turn on the hotspot on your phone to activate your kid's phone enabling them to pay using the scenario I outlined above.
No need to go way overboard buying and/or activating a smartphone, so long as you or the store can provide them with WiFi.
There is an area in Santa Monica, CA that lends itself well to hosting numerous homeless people living in their cars. I've long been churning over how to create a crypto micro economy there. Of course it would be easy to print large QR codes to display for "drive by donations", but how to spend it? Each week during the farmer's market, vendors would sell fresh fruit and vegetables for BTC. What about Internet? Assuming the homeless have deactivated (or even activated) cell phones, use the same suggestion I gave you above -- either the homeless would jump on some WiFi nearby when it comes time to make a purchase or one or two of the vendors would turn on a hotspot, bringing WiFi to the marketplace.
You only need an Internet connection when you load the balance (someone driving by in a car) and when you spend it (buying food using Wi-Fi provided by the vendors).

More importantly, now you have me brainstorming about the beer thing! If you bottled it with custom labels, you could leave a square space for a Load QR. Get a sheet of laser printer stickers and put a different Load QR on each bottle.

No, and this is why you see so many references to cold paper wallet storage being laminated slips of paper sitting in fireproof box. Once you securely generate an offline paper wallet (or 10!) you can laminate them, scan their public addresses into your hot wallet address book and also scan the public address as "watch only" addresses. Then put the actual paper in a fireproof box for safekeeping. Any time you want to add to your savings, just transfer some BTC into those addresses the same way you would send them to anyone else. Scanning each one to "watch only" lets you keep an eye on the balances and also prevents anyone who steals your cell phone from spending your BTC in cold storage. Do NOT load up long term cold storage as an active wallet on your phone (until the moment you're ready to spend the balance or split it up across new paper wallets).
Just remember to keep your hot wallet balances low and sweep the entire balance of a cold paper wallet into your hot wallet. If you don't want to convert the entire balance to hot, transfer the excess back into another cold paper wallet you haven't emptied yet or start a new one. Once you empty a cold paper wallet, tear it up and throw it away -- a device that could be snooping on you has been given the ability to spend from that paper wallet. That's why you only empty paper wallets you're about to spend and transfer any excess into a new, safely generated paper wallet. Never, ever scan the spend QR on a paper wallet with a huge balance only to buy a cup of coffee.

Understanding that selling or spending BTC is a taxable event if the BTC you held increased in value more than 50 cents during the time you held it. That means paying your tax bill with Bitcoin may in turn increase next year's federal tax bill.
Of course, you may also lower your federal tax bill if the BTC you spent lost value while you were holding it. Either way, the key to optimizing your tax bill is good record keeping. Don't mix your short and long-term holdings in the same wallet, because even if you do spend BTC that's over a year old, you'll never convince the IRS that you only spent the old BTC sitting in a particular address.

No more so than laminating your paper wallets and storing them in a fireproof box from Sentry. I'm not a fan of the hard cards because some people prefer to use a new address for each transaction. How would you plan to use a hard card? Use Mycelium to scan and spend directly from the spend QR? Use it as a generic "inbox" for all BTC you receive, from which you then distribute your balances to new addresses? Stick it in your firebox and use it for savings but never spending?
I'd rather buy a Piper and get a securely generated new paper wallet with each button press. Eighteen of these hard cards cost the same as one Piper and a good firebox. I can store or spend way more than 18 of the paper wallets over the lifetime of a Piper. They just won't look anywhere near as cool as these hard cards.
Depends on your plans and how paranoid you are about scanning the spend side QR codes. If you're going to scan the Load QR and stick it in your firebox for the rest of your life, then yeah, it'll definitely look cool to the people in your will.

Not sure if you're familiar with OSM and Open Source vs proprietary in general. Many people don't realize that the map data you see you on your cellphone, car dashboard or handheld GPS is licensed data. Someone has to pay (a lot) for access to that data. That's why it costs $180/yr to buy a new DVD for your car's navigation system.
OSM set out to crowdsource an alternate data source for that map data, one that provides the data and unlimited updates for free. People can capture GPS data to upload it to the site and manually enter features of the road (such as name and class). Even when governments publish the data to the public domain, it is often slightly inaccurate, requiring people to walk, bike or drive repeatedly through an area to capture more accurate shape details.
If you want to see the power of crowds, check YouTube to see what a bunch of us did after the Haitian Quake. There was no GPS data that the rescuers could download for their devices, so thousands of people around the world studied satellite images donated by Yahoo! and Google and manually created the map data. Someone scripted a job that created new downloadable map tiles every 30 minutes. You could keep a web page up on auto refresh and literally watch the map data for the country take shape. It was an amazing feat.
Here's an example on YouTube that shows what we were able to achieve 
This post is about getting OSM to make it easy to tip top contributors to OSM data in BTC. They are doing an amazing job around the world every day. You can visit openstreetmap.org and browse Haiti to see where it stands today. It's like night and day from the day before the quake.

Exactly. Once the sale is over everyone tears up the paper wallets where the private key was exposed.

paging I've been reading, lurking, studying and watching videos about cryptocurrencies for about 7 months now. I carry empty paper wallets in my real wallet and I have the Blockchain and Mycelium apps installed (also empty). The main reason I haven't bought any BTC yet is because I want to be certain I understand the tax implications for every move I will ever make before I ever make my first one.
My goal is to keep 10-20 BTC in cold storage (spread across 20 or so laminated paper wallets in my fire box) but buy and spend BTC like cash from then on. I plan to buy and spend each time on the same day, keeping the cost basis the same for each transaction. I see myself using Gyft a *lot* primarily for CVS, Target and Amazon.
I believe I understand it as such: if I use FIFO, I must buy my long position first, put it in cold storage and then wait a year before starting the "now use it like cash" phase, making sure that I never spend coins that are less than year old. 
However, if I use LIFO, I should still buy my long position right away to start the clock on it, but I don't have to wait a year to start the "now spend it like cash" phase. This is because I'm spending the newest coins first, and so long as I buy and spend on the same day, both sides of the transaction have the same cost basis and induce no tax bill. Just don't buy and spend any coin between one day and one year later.
Do I have this right? Build up my long position first and once I'm satisfied, start buying and spending on the same day forever thereafter? Yes, I will report each transaction, but it seems this is the only way to minimize my tax bill both in the near term and the long term.

Go to bitaddress.org, click in the "type some letters here" field and start moving the mouse around and typing letters until you get the counter down to zero. When the next screen shows up, click Paper Wallet and you will see three yellow graphic images that look a little like some European or Brazilian money. Next turn on BIP38 Encrypt, enter a good password, and then Generate. You will see three new images pop up, this time blue. Print them out and cut them out with scissors. 
Practice moving a little bit of your BTC onto them by transferring small amounts of your balance to the Load &amp; Verify code on the left side of each wallet. Your balance shown on your phone will go down by the amount you transferred out, but you're safe, don't worry. Then, in your app, use the menu to add a Watch Address and scan each Load &amp; Verify address, one at a time. You will see your balance return to the level you started at before doing this once you've scanned all the wallets. Only this time, all the BTC you've moved onto the paper is safe from nearly all Internet-based attacks, and you can still smile while looking at your total overall balance on your phone. You should also add your wallets' Load addresses into your address book of frequently paid addresses. This way you can safely hide your paper copies (protect them from fire, water and theft) while continuing to transfer BTC onto them. 
Practice with small amounts until you're comfortable with the process. You should only keep on your phone the balance you're planning to spend within the next day or two. Everything else should be kept somewhere that is safe from Internet attacks.
Note that what I've described is still not perfect protection for your money, but it is significantly better than what you imply you're currently doing: keeping it on your phone or in your Blockchain account.

I have not, but according to a regular contributor around here, shifting whole balances between specified addresses should be enough. The key is to be able to describe exactly when an address was loaded, when the contents were spent and their equivalent values in USD at each time. 
If you cannot prove that you held certain balances (that increased in value) longer than a year before spending it, the IRS can easily deny your claim and charge the max rate on the gains made while holding it. 
Now, we all know that many people have lost over the year, but there are still plenty who are up since buying over a year ago. It would be a real shame if someone doubled their tax bill because they didn't properly document when they acquired each balance and prove that the money sat in an address for over a year. The youngest BTC in an address sets the purchase date for that address, and if you were up when you spent, you'd want to make sure you can prove you held for over a year before spending it. 
That's part of the reason I want an app that shows me addresses that are safe to spend because it's up and has been sitting for at least a year, reducing the tax bill or is barely down, making it the small price to pay for non reportable events. "Barely down" feels the most like spending greenbacks. Once you acquire and spend it, you're done. Just make sure you're actually down!

Your uncle can choose to receive payments from those service providers in cash. It keeps his accounting simple since his books will stay in USD. Also, the providers take on all the risk of fraud -- just in case someone tries to reverse a payment. It's a great way to gradually adopt Bitcoin without jumping right in with both feet. If he starts taking BTC directly and the value tanks, it could significantly impact his ability to pay bills. By using the services above, everything else will seem exactly the same to him.

Thanks for commenting, I'm glad you made it in here today. I've been going through your various replies over the last several months, and all your advice is helpful and appreciated. 
Personally, I'm a little leery of trying to separate investment objectives by wallet since I plan to a) keep splitting up paper wallets into $500USD balances and b) eventually start carrying half a dozen empty wallets to use for ad hoc paper payments (like restaurant tips).
Say I loaded up some paper wallets as a nest egg and once retirement hit, I started breaking down my old paper wallets into new ones. Are you saying that the clock starts again if I break up a 1 BTC wallet into 5 brand new paper wallets? I would rather list transactions by date, amount and cost basis and just leave addresses off the books. 
What if I want to start selling off slices of a BTC for income during retirement? I would transfer a small amount to a new wallet immediately prior to the meetup for the sale, but not if that results in a reportable event incurring short term gains. 
I've gotta think I have some leeway in there in terms of determining what is and is not a reportable event. Transferring .001 BTC to a brand new wallet just before selling that entire wallet shouldn't be a reportable event with short term gains, IMHO. 
Of course I could be wrong, that's why I asked for your help, but I wasn't expecting that particular advice :)
@_date: 2014-10-23 15:08:36
Absolutely agree. I get nervous when I see even the slightest indication that people use it for everyday transactions.
If you load up the card as a Watch Only address on your phone, you can buy BTC on LocalBitcoins and have the seller transfer the BTC straight into your card. You'll know it's legit when your phone shows the transaction. While it's nice to be able to spend from the card by scanning the Spend QR in Mycelium, that's a "one and done" scenario according to some people.
That's kinda why I focus on suggesting the Piper with Mycelium. You can safely gen new addresses all day, every day just by pushing a button. Don't get me wrong, I love the designs and the certified durability. They just don't lend themselves well to everyday use, unless it's only to amass BTC.

The big thing I'm dealing with right now is trying to figure out how to buy and spend while losing just a little tiny bit of value while holding. Eliminates all the tax reporting requirements. I really don't feel like reporting every time I spent BTC that rose more than 50c in value while I held it. Huge PITA.
Would someone please write an app that shows a green or red dot next to an address based on where the value has gone since it was first loaded? Bonus points if it also tells you if the address has held a balance for more than a year so you know the tax bill is reduced if the value has gone up. 
@_date: 2014-06-11 16:16:10
1) yes, just like how some sellers on LBC have accounts at multiple banks; it allows them to offer instant, low (or no) cost transfers for buying BTC. In the case of the BTC buy, it's up to the buyer to trust the rep displayed for the seller. Some people out here show hundreds of sales with high rep.
2) I once sent $3,400 that way, and again, it wouldn't be prudent to do it off hours since I wouldn't be able to put a new license plate on the car and drive it away until the next business hours anyway. This would only help if he dropped off the car at my house during the off hours.

I still can't get behind this flight to offline computers in the name of safety. I have no connection to the company, but I have yet to be convinced that there is anything more convenient and safe than than a Piper offline wallet and Mycelium. 
You get a tissue box sized device which prints an encrypted paper wallet safely generated offline time you push the button. Load your BTC up on some wallets and load them up in Mycelium as Watch Only addresses. Carry a wallet or two with you and leave copies at home. When you need to spend BTC, Mycelium lets you scan the QR code of the wallet you're spending from during the transaction. 
No old laptops or PCs. It works just like cash today except you take a picture of the cash with your phone the instant you're about to spend it. Spend QR codes are never stored anywhere so safety is paramount. 
It escapes me why this is never brought up as a safe solution.

Please also understand there are huge tax implications when you sell or spend BTC. You will pay 42% capital gains tax on all gains made on BTC held for less than a year. As another commenter noted, just keep excellent records and you'll be fine. Record the purchase date, amount in BTC, its value in USD, the sale date, amount sold in BTC, value of amount sold in USD, and any capital gains (or losses) made on each transaction. 
Understand that your sales will most likely not align with your purchases, so when you go to report your proceeds from sales, the cost basis for different chunks of BTC you are selling in one transaction will differ. You will have bought some BTC a week ago at one price, some more a month ago at a different price and so on. All that must be broken out on your reporting paperwork. 
If you buy and sell all your BTC relatively quickly, then the value has little time to appreciate, thus keeping your tax bill low. I only bring this up because while you seem pretty intent on staying off any lists, you make no mention of the reporting burden you most definitely are picking up. You asked if you should get an attorney or accountant. Were you ready for all these reporting requirements?

Gen a key pair but don't load it. Then concat the first and last 5 chars of the public key and run it through MD5SUM. Use that MD5SUM as the password to your first BIP38 wallet. Now hopscotch your way through, generating as many as you want -- with each password being an MD5 hash of 10 chars from the prior wallet in the series: 5 from the front, 5 from the back.
Leave the (empty) seed wallet with the password instructions in your will. Distribute the derived wallets to your heirs, sequencing based on their age. Make sure they make and protect numerous copies. One wallet gets opened by the seed wallet and the rest of the wallets unlock each other in sequence. There's no way that even if someone stole a pile of BIP38 wallets they would figure out how to derive the list of passwords, AND figure out which password aligns with which BIP38 wallet. You also don't have to remember any passwords this way. Just figure it out once, hand out the wallets in sequence and then destroy the password list.
MD5 gives great passwords. You don't have to use the public keys in series -- any input strings will do. Just don't make it something that may change, like someone's phone number. Birthdays are probably too easy, but are insanely difficult for the average thief who would steal your firebox and look at your BIP38 wallets with total confusion.

Is that true, though? Isn't the next reward halving going to 12.5 within the next year or two? Then 6.25, 3.125, and 1.5626 before dropping below 1 BTC. We've already seen the reward drop from 50 to 25. I doubt it'll take a hundred years to get through the next four splits with the fifth one taking the reward below 1 BTC.
I think it's more likely that the final reward will be worth ~$640 when it is issued, not the other way around.

You also have other options for buying BTC in person. You can use localbitcoins to setup a face to face transaction or face to teller, where you agree to walk into a bank and deposit cash into someone else's bank account before they transfer the BTC into the wallet of your choice.
Also, late last week, LibertyX announced that you can now walk into 2,500 shops nationwide and buy Bitcoin at the register. Just tell them the denomination and they will sell you a pin code representing the purchased BTC. Enter the pin online and give them the public address of the wallet you want to use. The transfer is instant.

While the cons outweigh the pros to me, there's a pro I think is missed in the discussion so far.
If you know how a diode works electrically, there's a diode protecting the flow of your money. Merchants and other people can check the balance of the wallet that you have or are about to use to pay them, but there's nothing they can do to take money out of your wallet or address. At most, they can send you a bill.
By swiping my debit card at Target, Home Depot and now Jimmy John's, it's any wonder I get any sleep at all at night. Yes, I'm fully protected, but who wants to go through all that? If I had just bought some BTC and then used that BTC to buy gift cards at all of those establishments, I would have zero concern about my remaining balances. Even if those places accepted BTC directly, I would still have no concern because the system is designed to be safe when others have your public address.
Money always flows one way, based on the intention of the party sending the money. You list scams and wallet stealing malware as a con above. Please understand that all of that is outside of the realm of Bitcoin. That, like the credit card theft (and, oddly, the recent celebrity photo leaks) has entirely to do with the security of software wallets and poorly executed password and other safe computing practices by users.
By keeping all but the amount you intend to spend in the immediate future on paper and keeping only the amount you intend to spend in the immediate future on your phone or other Internet-connected device, no one will have access to your protected funds until you move them (or a portion) to a "less protected" device or system.
Scams only work when you don't recognize them as such and even then can only access funds stored in an online (aka "hot") wallet.
Next, as has been covered in here a bunch of times, the transactions are instantaneous. It is very difficult for someone to immediately spend the same BTC twice, and it becomes exponentially more difficult as every 10 minute period goes by. When accepting BTC directly, it is up to the vendor to decide how long they're willing to wait before they consider a transaction permanently recorded. Some of us like to say, "if a coffee shop is waiting 10 minutes for a block to permanently record the transaction, they are doing it wrong". On the other hand, it is easily worth it to wait 10 minutes (or multiples of 10 minutes) when spending a bit more, such as buying a car or a house.
Finally, it is important to note that Coinbase is already the most popular method for users in the US to buy, hold and spend BTC. They are also one of the top two payment processors in the US. When a transaction occurs between a Coinbase customer and merchant, that transaction occurs off the blockchain. It is instant and immediately permanent. The whole concept of trust increasing every 10 minutes goes away with this approach -- trust and transaction permanence reaches the maximum possible value instantly and stays there.
Again, the "10 minutes" discussion does not apply to transactions between customers using the most popular wallet in the US and one of the top two payment processors in the US. This, I think, is key and is a point lost on many, many people as evidenced by how frequently it comes up around here.

Are you sure that transaction wouldn't be legal today? This is the first I'm hearing of AML/KYC laws applying to private individuals who are transferring a not-very-liquid property. BTC can easily be exchanged back and forth for cash. A Porsche? Not so much.
Unless you were referring to other aspects of the transaction, such as the assumed withdrawal and deposit of said funds in their respective banks. If I choose to be unbanked and want to buy a car for cash from a private party, I can't imagine the seller is going to have to fill out AML/KYC documentation.

Don't put down 500 in fiat as the first move for starters. You can load up a paper wallet as a watch address and give them the public QR on paper. Then stand back and watch your address get loaded up each time you put 10, 50 or 100 down on the table.
Do it over wifi with a cheap unsubscribed phone that isn't logged into Apple or Google and they could even steal your phone and you wouldn't care. They can't get to your credentials anywhere, can't access your BTC (because the phone only has watch addresses on it), they can't make international calls because it's a dead phone, and they can't even sell the phone for good money because it's only worth about $20 anyway!

Depends on how far down you want to analyze it. You don't control the private keys to your wallets on CB. If you consider using a web page to interact with your wallets an "online wallet", then Blockchain.info is better because you maintain full control (and local copies) of your keys. On the downside, you need to know how to protect your data and make copies.

I think there's a difference between not reporting the gains on buying and spending within a reasonably short stretch of gains, but if you mined as a 9th grader and are now slowly spending a couple million dollars you made by holding through college, that's a little different. You differentiated between large and small purchases, whereas I had hoped you'd differentiate between ridiculously small gains made over a short period and massive gains you've enjoyed over the years. 
Aside from paying the rent, mortgage and perhaps utilities, there are precious few other things you can't buy with BTC, thanks to Amazon and Target (Gyft, really). So if you're going to declare that you're not going to report small gains, remember, you could buy just about anything you need with BTC, even the small things. Kids are probably graduating now as multi millionaires in BTC paper. And may never need to work. Ever.

An "account" is a bit of a misnomer. Are you looking for a no-verify exchange? Are you looking for a public address to store BTC? Are you planning to meet someone in public to make a buy? What's an account in this context?

I hate to sound like a broken record in these kinds of posts, but did you take capital gains into account? If you bought and spent the BTC at around the same price, then it's not much of a concern. But if you've held them less than a year, and have enjoyed the recent run up, then you owe the feds 42% of the purchase price.
OTOH, if you can prove you held all that BTC for over a year, then you "only" owe 15-20%. OTOOH, if this was your way of stopping the bleeding after buying at $1,200, then hats off to you! That's a nice big loss to counter some hefty gains.

Maybe it's a generational thing. I've been around computers for enough decades to now have accessories that I can't plug in anywhere. Hard drives I can't mount because they don't make that kind of SCSI interface for PCI slots anymore. A radio that I can't remote control anymore because the custom software fired pins on the RS-232 port in a special way. I used to rotate tape backups out of the server room to Iron Mountain, and I've had tapes come back unusable. All media breaks down, eventually.
Contrast that with a Piper where the paper is rated to store images for 20 years. No electronics or custom interface ports needed. I doubt your USB jump drives will still work in 20 years if you can even find a place to plug them in -- remembering this is after your house burns down and you had to buy a new laptop at Staples. The Piper only needs standard wall outlets and cash register paper rolls to be available for the foreseeable future. It doesn't even use ink. And you don't need the Piper to work after the fire to access your BTC -- only to make more wallets.

Mycelium has been getting a lot of buzz lately once they introduced their own version of localbtc. Federal agencies are really cracking down on exchanges. They are even setting up stings to catch people selling huge amounts of BTC (but I haven't heard of any reason to believe buying huge amounts of BTC for cash is cause for concern).
I think this AML/KYC stuff is going to be the new normal around here. When you can move $10,000,000 anywhere in the world in seconds with a couple of clicks on your phone, that makes some people stand up and take notice. No need for bags or briefcases full of money getting stuffed into private jets anymore. This is the only screw they can turn.

A user (may have surprisingly) announced that LibertyX (the rebranded Boston Bitcoin ATM people) have just established a service whereby you can buy BTC at 2,500 storefronts across the country. Through their network, you can buy PINs at participating retailers that, when entered into the LibertyX website, will cause the purchased amount of BTC to get transferred into a wallet of your choosing.
Just like that, there are now 2,500 stores in 33 states where you can buy BTC at Bitstamp prices and 0 processing fees (for now). Just happened yesterday. Huge news, I think. I found three retailers within 15 minutes of my home.

I know that transactions do not result in whole BTC being left over, so when you send BTC, you actually send enough leftover pieces to cover the amount. Then the receiving wallet sends you your change. That change can later serve as an input to another spend, similar to what you're seeing in A and B.
I can't explain E. Who would code a website that lists BTC with a unit indicator of $? Not sure.

Already wrong. Stopped reading here. Mycelium lets you use QR codes on the Spend and Receive side of the transaction. No need to sweep. No need to import. Private keys are not kept in memory. 
That's why I always say that Mycelium makes paper wallets work just like cash, except that this paper has no value until you take a picture of it with your phone and type in a password.

You have to go way back in the Internet archives, but check out NoCatAuth. Many years ago, someone developed a captive portal that enabled people to charge others to use their Wi-Fi (which typically violated ToS, by the way). The system was so comprehensive it even supports centralized logins. Someone who created an account in Los Angeles could login if they found a node in NYC. 
It never really took off, but it has nearly all the features you describe. There's even an O'Reilly book on the topic.

Thank you for that. That is clearly an important point. I also failed to mention that you can take losses on any BTC that has declined in value in a one for one counter to BTC gains, but only up to $3,000 against USD income.

I first got online with Prodigy in the 80s and was an adult at a university in the 90s when the general public first started getting access. I remember the day AOL opened their TCP/IP gateway, adding 20 million users to the Internet at once. I was already on the Internet for two years by then.
Now that I'm an IBMer, I've been trained on how to give an "elevator pitch". Explain something in a minute or two, leaving only the need for a detailed follow up, no high level questions.
See if you can deliver this in two minutes, leaving no high level questions unanswered:
Bitcoin resembles a global currency that belongs to no nation or central bank. This digital money has special characteristics. Instead of having just one bank account, you may have several: one or more that you can access from your phone or PC and one or more that reside entirely on paper. You normally keep small balances on your phone and large balances on paper locked up in a fireproof box at home. You may also carry slips of paper in the wallet in your pocket. The slips have no value until you load them up with a balance using your cellphone. This makes it easy to transfer Bitcoin to someone even if they're not prepared to receive it (don't have an app).
The network that supports the money transfers also functions just like the Visa, Mastercard and American Express networks. You can pay for goods and services in stores and online just like you can with debit and credit cards. But instead of three big companies, there are thousands of individuals who dedicate processing time on their home computers to keep the system going. It costs them a significant amount of money to get started doing this and it runs up their electric bill, so the network pays them to help keep it running.
Many governments and central banks feel threatened by this global parallel economy they can't control and feel the need to make attempts at restricting its use or making it appear less attractive. In the U.S., the IRS treats Bitcoin more like stocks than cash, so that makes the tax reporting a little weird. You don't generate a tax bill if you buy Bitcoin from someone, but if you earn some the way I described above, it is reportable income. Also, no matter how you acquired it, any increase in the value of the Bitcoin is also reportable when you sell it. Unfortunately, the tax bill is higher if you keep any Bitcoin less than a year -- that's the IRS's attempt at making it less attractive than cash.
EDIT: First time trying (and admittedly speaking too quickly) I had 16 seconds left on the clock.

Remembering gains less than 50c don't need to be listed. The long term gains on a $4.50 cup of coffee is 57c. A $3.75 cup keeps the gains below 50c.
On a more serious note, my strategy is to keep long term BTC separate from short term BTC and buy and sell the short term BTC as quickly as possible. This keeps the gains near 0 and potentially off your tax forms. You can also donate long term holdings to offset those short term gains that are reportable. The worst thing you can do is spend several thousand dollars' worth of BTC that climbed form $100 to $700 364 days after you bought it. Hold it two more days to cut your tax bill by 66%.
Remember, too, that you can buy and hold long term holdings forever and never report it until you spend it. Just keep it in cold storage in your firebox or a domestic exchange if it exceeds $10,000. Great for silently building up an estate for your heirs.

Wow, I'm sorry that happened to you. Must've been scary. There has to be a way to do it safely for both parties. If Bitcoin solved the Byzantine Generals problem, surely there's a way to safely make a buy from a stranger in public.
For 500 in fiat (this thread), seller hands over 5 public key QRs on paper for balance verification. Then you both hit the table simultaneously, 100 in fiat for one private QR containing the equivalent in BTC. The buyer sweeps the private QR. Repeat four more times. Unfortunately that is a lot of fiat to be flashing in a Starbucks.

Are they a 501(c)(3) non-profit? If so, it is *critical* that donors learn how to donate properly. If done properly, the donor won't get charged for any capital gains taxes levied against any capital gains made on the donated BTC. Otherwise, people donating as if it was just like any other purchase are still responsible for the capital gains taxes on any gains over 50 cents. Learn how to donate properly. It matters.

I usually just tie it into my general preference to flip the concentration of power and influence. I'm a 20 year Linux guy with a penchant for studying just about anything and everything that puts "power" back in the hands of people - Linux, Android custom ROMs, the tiny homes movement, up to and including running diesels on WVO. Bitcoin fits right into that line of thinking. All of those techniques and technologies allow you to disconnect from traditional social structures designed to maintain the current distribution of power and influence.
I just ran into my first real Bitcoin detractor at work, but he also agreed with SCOTUS on the Aereo decision, so it's going to take some time with him.

Was coming here to post something similar. Because the regulatory and legal landscape is still relatively new around crypto currencies, no one could say for sure that stolen BTC may not be one day forcibly returned to their owners. BTC that has not been run through a mixer can easily be traced. Imagine being told that the $1,000 in BTC you just bought on localbitcoins was just stolen a week earlier and the justice dept tells you to return it.

Rereading your post, I see we have a fundamental difference in the desired end user experience. Canceling out my original reply, I realize now I would rather have the credit card reader (thinking Home Depot or a supermarket) display a QR code encoded with a payment request to a one-time address. Then I'd scan it and approve the payment right on my phone (may have to enter my pin).
Same number of steps as swiping my card, choosing credit or debit (or hitting cancel to process my debit card as a credit card), and hitting Yes to approve the payment, but without touching the grimy, germy fake pen or touchscreen.

I agree that it's a strange approach, but if I were planning to do this, I would place a Piper offline paper wallet printer on top of the table. Make sure to point out that the switch is in "Forget" mode and have each buyer push the button for a new, safely generated wallet. Have them fold the paper to hide the private key and then you use your phone to load the balance. 
They are not going to be high quality artwork and such, but you're absolutely correct, any time someone sells you a paper wallet, you had better sweep it into another wallet before the two of you separate. That's sweep, not import the private key and DEFINITELY not as a watch only address.

I think this is lost on most people. If the network can be demonstrated to be perturbed in this way by an entity with less cash than a typical megabank, the value of Bitcoin will plummet. The Blockchain is where the value is derived. If that cannot prevent a double spend of millions of BTC, they all drop. I doubt the party that invested all that time and money will find it worth it in the end.

I understand where you're coming from, OP. Not that I got burned or anything, but the first time I printed out a sheet to learn more about the whole thing, I studied the hell out of it and noticed that the addresses were different. It was nice of you to point it out. 
Next time, while the wallet you to copy is up on the screen, hit Print Screen, pull up Paint and then hit Ctrl-v to paste the screenshot into Paint. Trim the image down to the wallet you want to copy and then copy and paste two more copies of the wallet, stacking them neatly. Now print the page and cut out the three exact copies.

Yes (as IkmoIkmo said), but it's not just limited to changing BTC to USD. You do not need to report anything to the IRS when you buy BTC with cash or sell something like a car directly for BTC. You DO need to report when you transfer BTC out of the address(es) you own.
That means even if you didn't sell the BTC for cash, you are still responsible for calculating how much the BTC increased in value in terms of USD while you held it and report THOSE increases to the IRS. You can transfer all you want back and forth between addresses and wallets you own, but as soon as you transfer BTC out to someone else's ownership, you become responsible to report at tax time the dates you acquired the BTC, the dates you sold it, and how much the BTC went up (or down) while you held it.
It's not just when selling them for cash. It's when you transfer them out for any reason. You can use losses on some transfers to counteract gains made on others, but you'll have to report the losses as well in order to do that.

Thanks for posting. Glad you got out okay. I've been trying to figure out the best way to protect both participants. 
If you handed them a paper wallet (and quietly kept a copy) and they didn't try to rip you off, you could insist they sweep it into their own account (which anyone should do immediately anyway). If they do rip you off, let them run away with the paper like they tried to run away with your phone. Then all you do is sweep it back into your account from the other copy while they're still running away.
Point being, you never need to pull out your phone around them and the paper never has more on it than you were intending to sell.

After hitting several Bob Evans restaurants across the country, I wrote to them asking them to do exactly this. They put each bill down at the table, but you must take the bill up to the register at the front of the restaurant to pay. With this, each bill could get it's own address and customers could pay at the table. Take the slip up front, the cashier scans the barcode and sees it's already been paid. It should be a simple check to ensure the bitcoin address has equal to or more funds than the balance of the bill. 
I felt it was easier to start with one huge chain that probably has direct access to the coders of their POS system vs trying to attack the problem from the other direction: develop a new POS and start convincing businesses to make the switch.

Most merchants use a business account provider like Coinbase. The providers offer protections against double spending and offer instantaneous (and guaranteed) off-chain transactions when paid by Coinbase users. If the business performs all transactions on the chain, it's up to them to strike a balance between convenience to customers and their own risk. Do you really think if ghash would ever try a double spend as part of a 51% attack that they could be convinced to do it for YOUR cup of coffee??
If a business is waiting for a confirmation on the chain for a cup of coffee, they are doing it so very, very wrong.
And as for your second question, Coinbase offers merchant apps for iPad. When Sandy knocked out the Internet, they didn't knock out the cellular carriers. My Verizon Jetpack is often faster than my cable modem at home. Of course, I have the lowest tier, but cellular Internet is actually very fast these days and processing Bitcoin transactions takes very little bandwidth.

What said. It's very important to state you have the exact correct attitude about it. The only thing missing from your original thinking was that you're supposed to sweep any balances to another address the moment someone hands you a paper wallet.
That is a natural and perfectly acceptable part of the process. I know it's tough to think that way if you tend to think of paper wallets as the same as paper money in your leather wallet, but that is one way that it is different. When someone hands you a paper wallet, just grab your phone, sweep the balance into your phone's account (OR transfer it to another paper wallet that you DO trust) and throw away the paper they just gave you. Mycelium can sweep from one from paper wallet directly to another one if you don't want to keep any balances on your phone.
There's absolutely nothing wrong with that approach. You're already halfway there.

You absolutely did, thank you.
If things go as planned,  the only BTC I expect to hold each night is the long term investment. Otherwise, I plan to buy and sell small amounts at random times but always within the same day. Thus, the short term holdings should all have the same cost basis at time of purchase and sale, meaning no tax load. All short term transactions would be reported but show 0 capital gains. 
I understand it'll get complicated if I hold anything other than the long term holdings overnight, so I don't plan to -- not until the long term holdings reach one year plus one day (10 years if I can help it, but 366 days is the minimum).
Thanks again for coming around today. I know a couple of us had questions for you in here.

So how would you protect the seller (when there's no escrow service)? Swap the balance of the trade in 20% slices, fiat for paper wallets (with a spoken password)? Wait for the buyer to sweep the balance each time before proceeding to the next slice. If I were selling that much, I would show up with no paper or phones that grants access to any balance beyond the amount agreed to in the sale. The buyer can steal everything off me.. burner phone.. encrypted paper.. and get away with nothing of value.

There is still a big backlash against all forms of regulation, without the desire to understand the context.
People just need to remember that a) consumers who spend and businesses that accept bitcoin as payment for goods and services will not need to register for a bitlicense (unless that consumer starts a side business as an exchange) and b) only transactions that have yielded a net gain of more than 50c for the consumer (and have not been cancelled out by a donation or equal or greater losses) are the ones that need to be reported.
Coffee shops won't need to register for a Bitlicense and consumers who buy and spend Bitcoin relatively quickly will likely never need to report capital gains. There's still plenty of opportunity for earning, buying and spending bitcoin -- even in New York.

If you search YouTube for a couple who spent a year on BTC, there's a scene where they go to buy gas. The gas station didn't take BTC, but the guy behind the counter agreed to serve as an exchange for them. He tried to take their BTC and pay their bill from his pocket, but the transaction failed via Coinbase. Then they whipped out these gold coins, each worth 10 BTC or something and paid him that way. They showed him how to peel the label off to reveal the private key and spend it. He took the coins and paid their gas bill.

That's actually interesting. Now, instead of needing to integrate a Bitcoin library into a Twitter bot, one can transfer funds using the traditional, text only capabilities that have been there almost from the beginning. One can schedule individual or repeat payments using any utility that lets you schedule tweets.
Subtle but very powerful. I hadn't thought of it being used this way. Good to see it in action. 
Think about paying utility bills this way. Link your twitter account to your actual account and just pay them with a simple text only tweet. Of course, some people may not like their payments being public like that, but I may not care if it suddenly became available to me that way. They tweet you with a balance and date due and you schedule a tweet to pay the bill.

I've been studying it since November, but I haven't bought any yet. (I just got my first tip today, though!) My wife and I even carry blank unencrypted paper wallets in our real wallets. The folded bitaddress ones fit nicely into the little pocket made for pictures of your kids or family.
I also have the Blockchain and Mycelium apps installed on an unsubscribed (non-rooted) Android phone. I even run around scanning QR codes, looking like a fool. I bring up the Mycelium "Buy/Sell" page a few times a day and check the prices nearby and other cities where I expect to travel soon. I scan other people's public key as a "watch only" in Blockchain to watch transactions come in before eventually deleting the address from my account. I'm really trying to practice the entire experience before finally jumping in and buying some.
A small part of what's holding me back is the wide range of prices on Mycelium. Right now, to buy $100 USD in BTC ranges from $700 to $758 per BTC. That's insane to me. There's a guy, Jagd, who I don't think realizes how to configure the client -- he's offering to sell at $945! His has been $200/BTC above everyone else for weeks now.
That gets me locked up in a little analysis paralysis. How do I know if I'm getting a good deal? How will the deal go down? What if the guy gets up and runs with 0 confirmations? What if it something happens and it tanks $100/BTC the next day? Also, I haven't setup an offline OS for printing paper wallets yet. I feel like I want to buy a Piper before I ever make my first BTC buy, but I also feel like it'll make me weird.
Of course, I'm staring at an Alien Sex Fiend concert poster I took down after a show, so I'm used to weird.
I know I'll feel better about all that stuff once I just get out there and do it, but right now it's rather paralyzing. I just want to make my first $100 buy and get it over with.
Maybe some nice person (LOL) will do the exchange with me over Google Wallet so I can just say I got the first one done ;)

Totally understand. Someone was bitching about the "1% premium" going to Coinbase to repurchase the BTC, yet everyone seems to ignore the capital gains. It's a running theme around here. The gains are not free money. If he paid from a checking account, there would be no capital gains tax owed, long or short term (unless he funded his checking account by selling off some investments, of course).

Are you saying they exempt small amounts (like a cup of coffee) or that there is a push for a change in the regulations? Perhaps the two concepts wash out in the form of "you get to buy $600 worth of small purchases each year (or over your lifetime)."

One last thing, I don't plan to use coinbase or other online wallets -- only Mycelium (or whatever app will keep local hot wallets and integrate so well with paper) and paper wallets. I assume keeping the paper wallets for cold storage will suffice in maintaining that separation. I would then be more willing to report Bitcoin addresses as my holdings if it helps prove the fact that the BTC loaded in those addresses has sat for at least a year before spending.
Without holding you to anything, do you think hot wallet apps and cold storage on paper provides sufficient separation of BTC? If so, I feel like I'm really closing in on a repeatable approach:
First, load up long term cold storage on paper in my fire box. Then start buying and selling via my hot wallet app of choice, getting in and out of short term BTC in the same day each time. At the end of the tax year, report every short term transaction, with each one having the same cost basis at time of purchase and sale and thus no taxable gains.
Once I hit retirement and start spending the long term holdings, I will break down the old paper wallets into a number of smaller ones (for safety) and slowly spend those balances. I understand that at that time those transactions will incur a tax load, but at the lower, long term rate. I can expect to provide addresses to prove that the holdings were long term.
Here's another thought that just hit me: I should start with 12 or more paper wallets in long term cold storage. Then, years later, I would break up one old paper wallet a month. Instead of spending all of the new wallets split out from the old one, I should just break into another old one, thus guaranteeing that the address sat untouched for at least a year. Once I split up all the old ones, a year would have gone by, thus enabling me to return to the first new one I populated with old money. So long as I don't rip through my entire pot, I just need to make sure that I have enough wallets around that there is always one at least 366 days old.
Now I'm envisioning a folding envelope with 12 pockets, each holding one or more paper wallets that I can't spend until that month arrives! I like it!
For instance, here is a sheet of 12 2"x2" pockets, perfect for holding folded paper wallets.

The key is to make sure no data gets into the VM. Define the VM and delete the NIC. Disable all folders shared with the host OS. Install the OS or boot the VM from a bootable CD image you trust. Cut a CD image of the code from bitaddress.org in your host image so you can "mount" the CD image in your wallet VM.
Then, when you want to spend from the cold storage, cut a transaction to a file. Mount a virtual USB drive and save the file to the virtual USB. Open the virtual USB in the host image and send the transaction to the Blockchain. Or just print paper wallets from the offline wallet VM, load them up with the "air gap" spending method I just described and then import your paper wallets into Mycelium for easier, less complicated spending. Only import small amounts, like $50 at a time into your phone wallet. 
Depending on the implementation, hypervisors can create very strong isolation between the host OS and the VMs. Back when I started virtualization consulting, a white paper was circulating that showed the NSA approved VMware ESX for keeping Secret data compartmentalized. That's nothing to sneeze at. It doesn't relieve you of the duty to keep the host OS secure and virus-free, however. 
It should work just fine. Don't do this on a laptop you took from high school to college, though. Something like that is typically a festering mess.

Apart from the quality answers you've already received, let me add that this is why you periodically see discussions about which prefix should become the new norm for pricing small ticket items.
The two main contenders are "mBTC" or millibitcoins (a standard metric prefix) and "μBTC", aka microbitcoins, aka bits. An mBTC equals about 60c USD right now, while about 18-20 bits equals 1c USD at the moment. You can see how if BTC really takes off, a bit may one day equal 1c USD, making the mental math very easy.

So far, I like the idea of the buyer tearing a blank paper wallet in half. Leave the private half at home and load the public side up in a burner phone as a watch only. Bring the burner phone, the fiat and the public QR to the deal. Jump on wifi (or bring your own hotspot in another pocket). Hand the public QR over and tell the seller, "I will put the fiat down one bill at a time. After each one, please load up this address with the equivalent BTC. I will wait for each transaction to appear." Put down 10, 20, 50 or 100 at a time.. whatever makes you comfortable. Repeat until the buy is complete.
If the seller steals a little fiat off the table, that was the risk. You keep your phone out of reach so they'd have to blatantly jump over the table to try to steal it. You never signed into Google or Apple and the Bitcoin app only has watch addresses, so they can't use the phone for anything and they can't steal any BTC. They only get the little bit of fiat you put down. The only risk to the seller I see is the buyer bringing counterfeit bills.

Keep in mind there are a lot of technical people in here. Bits to most of us are the individual 1s and 0s that make up a data stream. It is also used when referring to the relative strength of encryption keys. [EDIT: I reread your comment, and you obviously get it.] I'm personally of the opinion that only techies will know about the other uses of the term and will continue to be voluntarily confused. "The Normals" won't give two shits about that. 
Also "bits" has been a part of the monetary lexicon for a hundred years or more (and already referring to one of the smallest units of money available!) "The Normals" will know that one. I'm personally happy to see it get reinvented for the new millennium.

It's rather embarrassing, but I'll share it anyway. I have a 5 digit UID at Slashdot, but it has become such a craphole that I hardly read anything beyond the headlines in Feedly. I can honestly say the first time I'm sure I heard about Bitcoin once and for all was last October.
My 65 year old mother-in-law read about it in the New Yorker. She has a travel themed room with a glass top coffee table displaying money that people have brought to her from around the world. She asked me to get her some Bitcoin for the table. 
I honestly have no idea how I missed this revolution for so many years. Luckily I was off work for December and January, so I spent nearly every day learning about Bitcoin. Reading, watching introductory videos, even Senate hearings that lasted 2 hours at a time. I watched live the two day long NYDFS hearings that led to the licensing regulation in NY. I still read quite a bit about it daily, and have really come to enjoy the community here. I was on Imgur for years, but never had a reason to join Reddit until last month. The people are great here.

Seems like a sucky time to be ready to get into mining. The dearth of reasonably priced, good gear and the increase in difficulty right around the corner shows bad indicators for any new mining activities this summer. Maybe we'll see a flood of cheap devices hit the used market once the difficulty increases. If I can get a TM4 for $1,500 this summer, I have to think it will still be tempting.

Learn about a dead man switch. The basic theory is that a mechanism will trip if a person does not perform a certain task within a set period of time. If you trust web sites to last that long, there are web sites out there that will take a certain action, like send an email, if you don't periodically let the site know you're alive.
It doesn't have to be a web site, though. If you're a tinkerer, you also can do it electromechanically. Build a secret box wall switch so that if no one turns on the light in your kitchen after two weeks, the entire switch will pop out of the wall, exposing a hidden pocket with paper wallets and written instructions rolled up inside. Of course, that wouldn't survive a fire too well, hmm. Maybe it's better to store a key to a fireproof box!

It goes way beyond HD storage. It keeps your sensitive data private and constructs Bitcoin transactions safely within the device, away from interception or tampering by connected devices no matter what their status in terms of malware infections. Once the spend transaction is constructed, it is copied over USB to the host PC, which in turn transmits it to the Bitcoin network. It provides the ultimate safety for storing and spending BTC.

How many is "a bunch"? If it's 10,000 BTC and they mined the coins back when they were below a penny, they only owe capital gains tax on $8,500 vs $7 million. I know that if I just came to the realization that I was supposed to pay short and long term gains all along for hundreds or thousands of transactions covering tens of thousands' worth of "free money" I've spent over the last 5 years, I'd be shitting myself too.
There are a number people out there who are slowly coming to the realization that they've f'ed up BAD over the last few years by not keeping track of any BTC they've acquired and spent, including the price they paid or the price they got at sale. It's not impossible they've decided to do away with all the "free money" that's been piling up. For some, it's not worth the effort that it's already going to take to untangle the mess. Just sell it cheap or donate it (if you've held it over a year) to erase any future tax bill.

I think in the US this is being handled in a de facto way in that Coinbase is the most popular place to buy and hold coins as well as one of the most popular ways that businesses are starting to accept BTC. When both sides of the transaction involve BTC held at Coinbase, the transactions are guaranteed by Coinbase and are off chain, resulting in no mining fees, especially for micro payments. 
The down side is, of course, that it represents the centralization of Bitcoin in the US.

When you need to spend BTC, spend it by scanning the QR with your phone and enter the password when asked. Buying or dedicating PC hardware is way over the top IMHO.

If you don't expose the encrypted private key to anyone other than via sealed written instructions to your attorney, who do you think will a) get their hands on the encrypted QR, b) know what to do with it, and c) spend a significant amount of effort trying to guess the passphrase to each wallet?
Notice I said middle names not given names. Plus 8-digit birthdates. With all the kids' data strung together (in varying order) in each wallet. So one wallet's passphrase may be MICHAEL19890214ANNE19921113JOHN19940608 while the others have the same data but in a different sequence. You think that's easily crackable? Even by a dictionary attack? Without any knowledge of the data sources? That's a lot of guesswork to unlock some $50,000 wallets. Note that passwordmeter.com scores that sample password at 100%.
I think they make great passwords, considering no one will see the QR or the instructions to decrypt them until death.

*sweep. Always sweep paper you didn't generate yourself!
Only half /s, couldn't resist. But thanks for the image of her sitting down at the end of the night with about 200 wallets and a cellphone.
I'd almost rather see a setup whereby when someone tips her electronically, it triggers photocopies of a dollar bill to drop down from the ceiling. Tip $10, ten bills drop. That way, you still get the satisfaction of tipping electronically, she still "sees" money coming in, and there's no half hour of sweeping foreign wallets at the end of the night. And the fake bills can be reloaded overhead after each dance is over. Uses way less paper but retains the same effect. Hell, just buy some club dollars at the bar and stick them in the g string. 
Otherwise, the club would have to put up a 3 foot by 3 foot qr code so that you can scan it from your seat. A projector would be too bright, but a signboard like the round number announcement board at MMA might be too cumbersome. Imagine the girl clumsily carrying her qr code up the stairs to an easel?

Congrats! I like the safe use of paper wallets that Mycelium features. If you have cold paper wallets, you can load up the Load address as a Watch Only address and never scan the Spend QR until the moment you're ready to spend. By encrypting the Spend side with BIP-38 you can even carry COPIES of your paper wallets in your real wallet and STILL not have to worry if someone steals your phone, your wallet or both.
This means you can still see all your balances at all times but never have to worry about your BTC getting stolen one way or another. 
Don't leave all your BTC sitting in your phone's wallet. Only that which you're planning to spend soon.

A lot of naysayers in here. I'd suggest looking into Bitpay or even investigate the bitcoin integration of QuickBooks, which he may already use. Both would be a more formalized integration of bitcoin payments and allow the owner to receive the payments in USD. If you can convince him that his accounting will not change in two minutes or less, he might be more open to the idea. Plus, it'll save you the effort of having to prove the cashflow that runs through your pocket.
It's much cleaner and looks way less shady than you personally exchanging money with the till in the middle of customer transactions. I hope you do it, but I also hope you do it the right way the first time.

Yes. You can go to bitaddress.org and generate and print BIP-38 paper wallets. You don't have to protect encrypted private keys, other than the normal protection you should offer for that kind of money. Spend $45 on a fire proof box at Staples. Or swap copies of your encrypted wallets (but not passwords!) with your friends. If you use good enough passwords, no one can access your balances. That's why I mentioned making passwords over several words strung together from words in your journal. Just make sure you don't forget or misplace those words!

This is an excellent idea, but I want to remind everyone that for more significant donations, you could help yourself more by donating BTC in kind. Normally, you're responsible for taxable gains when you transfer BTC out that has increased in value more than 50c while you held it.
Donate BTC that you've held for over a year, and you won't be responsible for the gains and you can deduct the current value up to $3,000 from your income. 
tl;dr donating BTC is an awesome idea. Donating without properly accounting for it can hurt you when dealing with significant balances.

I'm glad it's not just me.
Got another question for you. I saw the other day someone posted, asking everyone to stop complaining about Bitcoin taxes and just donate the long term holdings free of capital gains and against your AGI. Is it possible to reduce your AGI to zero by giving matching donations?
Suppose I were a Bitcoin multimillionaire. Say I built myself a great off grid cabin and everything is paid off. I even has a Tesla and live near a Supercharger so I don't even have to put gas in my car. I grow most of my own food, but I occasionally splurge and cash in some BTC to go shopping at Target courtesy of Gyft.
Of course I would owe capital gains when cashing in the long term BTC, but can I cancel out those earnings with donations to an approved charity? Is it possible to live off nothing but the land and accumulated BTC? That wouldn't help with school taxes, but is it possible to reduce your AGI to zero or to a level that you have no taxable income or gains left to report? Just a question.

I like that. Except for the way developers build up areas, I couldn't be certain that a wooded area or a meadow wouldn't be a condo community by then. A variant on it would be to spell out the passwords in ASCII hex. Of course, that will limit the number of characters you can use in the password, but it works. Or just list the passwords right in the Blockchain and list the txid showing the password in your will. No one on the blockchain will know what encrypted private key the password unlocks.

May take half a year or more to get it all back in BTC, but perhaps more importantly, if he's in the US, he's going to have to document the date, amount in BTC and amount in USD every single time he gets paid. And if he mines in a pool, that's probably every 10ish hours. And every payout will be different and their equivalent amount in USD will be different. 
That is taxable income to the IRS, and is a freaking pain in the ass. If he's planning to spend it, he will need to figure out how much each few dollars' worth of BTC he just spent and figure out how much each few dollars' worth increased in value while he held it so he can pay taxes on those gains as well. OMG what a pain. 
Remember, you don't have to tell anyone anything so long as you buy face to face and hold. As soon as you buy from an exchange, mine, spend or sell, things go south pretty quickly. Better to buy f2f and hold vs mining or buying via an exchange. The free electricity is the least of his worries.

Very true. I just fleshed out a scene in another comment where the buyer and seller use the same bank. Give two slips to a teller with the two account numbers, an amount to transfer and the direction. After the fiat transfer is complete, you complete the BTC transfer (or other way around, based on rep). No fiat to flash, no one gets hit in the head. I suppose you could do it over Google Wallet just the same -- I'm not sure if those transfers are reversible, though.
@_date: 2014-06-21 11:49:19
You have some great answers in here. I tend to use it to indicate that the entire balance is moved vs. a typical transfer that can be any portion of the remaining balance. If you show up at a buy and the seller hands you a paper wallet to avoid giving you the opportunity to steal his phone, you'll want to verify the available balance, exchange cash for the wallet and then sweep it IMMEDIATELY before you and the seller part ways.
That ensures that the seller can't sweep the BTC after you leave, thus silently robbing you of your cash.

Sometimes the views expressed around here crack me up. I've been an IT professional for over 20 years, but because I've had my nose buried in enterprise computing, I totally missed the bitcoin revolution until a year ago, when my then 67 year old mother-in-law asked me to explain it to her. She read about it in The New Yorker. I researched it and was blown away a) by what it was and, b) that I totally missed it. That's what I got for abandoning Slashdot. She collects paper currency from around the world and asked me to print out a paper wallet for her to display in her collection.

@_date: 2014-06-03 19:14:15
So, OP, what do you want to talk about? I still haven't jumped in yet specifically because of the tax implications. has been very helpful and patient with me, hearing out my ideas on how to keep things straight and maintain accurate records.
First, you need to choose how you wish to account for your holdings, either First-In-First-Out, Last-In-Last-Out or Average Cost. I always thought your entire bucket of BTC was to be treated as one big pool and that you should buy for a year before spending any. (S)he taught me was that is okay to keep separate wallets and report some their gains separately, so long as I can prove how long the BTC sat in that wallet.
So if you're in it for the long run, but also want the joy of buying and spending BTC, you should keep some long term cold storage (say, on a laminated paper wallet in a fireproof box) and then use a separate hot wallet on your phone for buying coffee and stuff. Keep good records of each time you put balances on each wallet, including the date you loaded the balances and how much you paid for the BTC either at an exchange or in person. Don't mix your long term and short term BTC together, that can only get confusing.
Also, it's okay if you want to split up your long term storage to keep the balances on individual paper wallets low (say $1,000 or less). If you periodically rebalance your funds across wallets, it won't restart the clock in terms of how long you've owned the BTC just because you moved it to a new wallet. Just keep it away from short term funds in a hot wallet.
Finally, the best way to keep your tax bill low is to try to buy and spend your short term BTC at very similar exchange rates. Don't buy at $600 and then sell at $1,800 just 11 months later. You will get charged the max tax rate against the gains you made during the climb. Wait another month (if you can!) and cut your tax bill in half.
It is a very real situation that hardly anyone appears to take seriously. If you must spend a lot of BTC that you haven't held for a year yet, try to buy it and spend it at the same exchange rate. You're already paying sales tax when you buy things, don't unnecessarily burden yourself with a huge capital gains tax on top of it just because you didn't do your homework.
No, the increase in value is absolutely not the free money most everyone thinks it is. The gains become taxable when you transfer it out to buy goods, sell them in Mycelium, or give them as gifts. Unless, of course, you donate it to a 501(c)(3) charity.

The shipping package is tamper evident and you MUST attach it by USB to an Internet-connected machine. It is designed to protect your balances even in the most antagonistic PC environments.
The PC constructs a request to transfer a certain amount to a certain address and sends that request to the Trezor. The Trezor is the only device that knows the private keys, so it receives the request, constructs a transaction internally, signs it and transfers the signed transaction back to the PC for broadcast to the network, never transferring or exposing any of the private keys off the device.
I haven't been convinced yet because there doesn't seem to be a mobile spending solution. Sounds to me like the preferred approach is to transfer your spending BTC to your phone's hot wallet before leaving the house any time you know you're going to spend some bits. Otherwise, it looks great for people who spend their BTC while sitting at their PC or laptop. Definitely being pitched as among the best in cold storage for high balances.

Agreed. I'm only talking about phones in my example (which are small computers!) but you're right, it is worth it to protect the phone that will hold the spend QR in memory even for a few seconds.
And the backups are also important -- you can even give encrypted copies to your kids and have the executor of your will distribute the passwords when you die. By keeping only the Load &amp; Verify addresses, you can gradually add funds to each address without exposing any of the Spend addresses to the Internet. Then when the kids get their passwords, they will find out how much their inheritances are worth.

Right on. I remember helping one kid move his tips from Bitcointip to Changetip when BTT was closing shop. He remembered getting a quarter several years ago and I think it was worth about $45 when he moved it. But you're right -- telling us the minimum we're allowed to tip was pretty obnoxious.

Sorry for your loss. That's an expensive lesson. Only keep what you're willing to lose in an online wallet. Use BIP-38 offline paper wallets for most of your BTC. Add their public addresses to your phone wallet as watch only addresses so you can add BTC to them and monitor their balances without risking them getting emptied by hackers.
The Mycelium app lets you safely spend directly from paper wallets without registering them in your phone wallet. Remember, once you scan a Spend QR you should consider its balance under attack, so it's best to keep the balances on each paper wallet low.
You will find many in the tinfoil hat club telling you that you can't safely make paper wallets, so you may wish to consider picking up a Piper paper wallet printer for $200. You get a fresh, safely generated paper wallet each time you press the button on the box. I am not affiliated or even a customer. I don't even have any BTC! I just study this stuff all day.

/s aside, what if someone bought a car with their gains? Say they wanted to be on the right side of the law and properly reported the gains that were used to buy the car. Now say they've only had that one address all along and didn't report all the cups of coffee, sodas and dinners they'd been buying throughout the years. They've unwittingly exposed their address when reporting the gains used to buy the car. You're only excused from reporting transactions where the gains total less than 50c unless you want to claim the losses.
Are you saying that the IRS won't check the address for other transactions that weren't reported? Or do you think that the IRS won't ask for the addresses involved when you (properly) claim long term gains on BTC held longer than a year but forget to list the supporting details? Or do you think that no one at the state or federal levels will piece together that you bought a car using some money that seemingly came from nowhere?

Slow down, take a breather for a second.
If this not for profit is truly 501(c)(3), bitcoiners can donate BTC directly to your organization tax free. Otherwise, by setting up a cash gateway, the donors ~~will~~ may incur a tax bill at the full value at the current exchange rate and the org ~~will~~ may lose out on some donated balance due to the transaction fees involved.
Accepting BTC directly is a huge win-win for everyone involved if you have the designation. Please don't force donors convert to fiat in order to donate. Note that this is only for BTC that can be proven was held by the donor for longer than one year.
EDIT: Bitpay has a [page]( for 501(c)(3) organizations. They do not charge a transaction fee for those kinds of donations. I can't tell if they just pass the BTC straight through or if the donors still convert the donations to fiat. I am also unaware of the implications of changing to fiat before donating.

If you were a buyer, would you hand over a public QR on paper for the seller to load and then slowly feed them the fiat? Either all at once for small buys or slowly hand it over for larger totals.

Would that creep you out as a seller, or would it impress you that someone was really covering their ass as a buyer?

Two things keep the door open for me. First is the fact that unless mixers are used, it is perfectly plausible to trace the transaction history of every satoshi. What better way is there to prove links within and between criminals and criminal organizations than to release a digital currency that can tell you every wallet that has ever hosted all or any portion of it. As Silk Road came crashing down, do you not believe that all of its customers started shitting their collective pants?
Second, when the NIST was designing or enhancing elliptic curve cryptography, the NSA came and told them exactly which value to use in a specific part of the function. That cryptography is central to all encryption on the Internet, including Bitcoin. Do you think the NSA would help NIST build perfect encryption or an encryption algorithm that only they can reverse?
Remember, they have the world's largest collection of math PhDs in house and everything they do is in pursuit of two things: protect the nation's secrets and gather everyone else's. I don't think it's far fetched that they had a hand in creating a global electronic cash that is mistakenly believed to be anonymous and untraceable.

Something I see idiots at work do every day. They emailed everyone who has exchanged emails with them at any time regarding the sale, and listed everyone's email address either on the To: line or the Cc: line instead of the Bcc: line.

@_date: 2014-10-23 13:12:08
I know it's too late, but:
1. Learn how to safely generate paper wallets, or just pick up a Piper if it sounds too complicated,
1. Use Mycelium to spend BTC or transfer balances to and between your paper wallet(s) and your hot wallet, and
1. Add your paper wallets as Watch Only addresses in Mycelium so that you will be alerted the instant any activity occurs in any of your paper wallets without risking exposure of the Spend address
Mycelium is unique because it gives you the option to work directly with QR codes, never requiring you to store a balance in an address whose private key has ever been seen online. If you need to spend some BTC sitting on a paper wallet, use Mycelium to send the payment directly from the Spend QR on the paper wallet. If you didn't empty the paper wallet completely, then IMMEDIATELY print a new paper wallet from the Piper and transfer the remaining balance from the first paper wallet to the new one (scanning only the Load &amp; Verify address on the new wallet) and destroy the now empty paper wallet.
By following those simple steps, you will never have an Internet-connected device that is aware of any Spend addresses longer than the few seconds it takes for you to transfer funds.
It's like having cash in your pocket that is worthless until you scan it with your phone to activate it. There is no point in storing your private keys on Internet-connected devices unless you're about to spend some or all of the balance. Using TAILS was a good start, but the approach fell apart when leaving the balance at Blockchain.
@_date: 2014-11-20 01:30:27
Does a Trezor show your Spend QR on demand? Serious question, I've never seen it work. Also, what happens if it malfunctions with your keys stored on it? If a Piper dies after you've printed some wallets, your wallets are still safe. 
Finally, how would you replace giving or selling someone a paper wallet the way you do with paper? Not a common use case, but I'm just wondering what your thought process is. 
@_date: 2014-06-21 13:10:21
I think it goes way beyond these key points as well. At least in the U.S., people are waking up to the extensive documentation required in order to stay in the good graces of the IRS. The capital gains tracking and reporting requirement simply makes this vehicle too complicated to serve as an alternative currency if you're doing anything more than buying and holding.

My point was that an attacker would have to guess that was the scheme from which the parent drew when developing a set of passwords.

I know. I've been in IT for 20 years. I totally agree that names on their own obviously make horrible passwords. I'm sure we also agree that it's impossible for someone to guess a private key that has never been exposed to air once it was printed and immediately sealed into an envelope. We just seem to disagree (assuming anyone ever sees the encrypted QR code before death) about how easy or difficult it would be to guess the password scheme the person used, even in the face of a dictionary attack. I think the three 8-digit numeric sequences intermingled between the names increases the difficulty significantly, but keeps the mental work required of the intended recipients low. 
You can also make the middle date be the middle person's wedding date instead of birth date. Or the birth date of their first child. Or write the middle person's name in lower case instead of upper case. I think there are ways.

Yup. Or keep it loaded up as a full account in Blockchain or Mycelium. The idea is to be able to sweep it back to your account as soon as they take off running -AND- to NOT be able to sweep it back once they protect themselves by sweeping it into their own account. Again, protect both parties.
It could get a little messy if no one wants to expose their phone and both show up with paper wallets (one full, one empty). One party has to trust the other at some point. Picture this: The buyer gives in and checks the balance on the paper before handing over the money. The seller has a sniper watching from a distance and the sniper sweeps the balance as soon as they see the seller grab the cash. By the time the buyer goes to sweep the balance, the paper wallet has already been emptied and the seller has the cash. It's up to the buyer's willingness to start yelling about getting robbed when no violent confrontation occurred. If the sniper swept it to a different account, the seller could even play dumb, showing the buyer the transaction that just went through. "I don't know what happened. I watched you import the code. There's the transaction right there."
You really could take paranoia to the extreme with this (not saying you did!)
Now let's see if someone can come up with a "deal gone bad" scenario where the seller gives in and is willing to use his phone to load a balance on a QR the buyer hands him.

It's all reportable as are any gains over 50c. And every payout will have a separate cost basis because the rate will be different at the time of the payout.

Then all his BTC was acquired on one date with one cost basis, greatly simplifying his reporting needs.

Anyone doing more than solo mining and accepting Bitcoin as payment for goods &amp; services must register if they wish to offer their services to residents of the State of NY. The two ways out are to register for a BitLicense and agree to KYC/AML collection or take significant steps to prevent anyone located in NY from accessing your web site or partaking in your service. This applies to anyone worldwide who wishes to offer services to residents of NY. The entire state, not just the city.
I think it's key to point out that this does not impact any business who wishes to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment for goods or services. It stifles innovative entrepreneurial development in the Bitcoin space, but it does nothing to hinder adoption as a payment method to businesses. Your coffee shop does not need to register to accept Bitcoin.

Not the best solution, but (if you're in the US) and you document when you bought and spent each balance (which you're supposed to do anyway), you can use the amount you lost to reduce your tax bill. I believe you can counter up to $3,000 per year in gains using the losses incurred by buying and spending BTC. 
One of the side effects of bitcoin being property, not currency, in the US.
On the flip side, keeping proper documentation lets you lower your tax due if you can prove that any gains you made by using BTC were made on BTC that you provably (i.e. separate wallet) held for over a year.

In all seriousness, you didn't ask about the profitability of mining. If you try to mine with a PC graphics card, you'll never earn a penny, let alone all your money back.

If you're in the US, there are some major hurdles to get over with the IRS reporting requirements. At the bare minimum, you need to write down every date you receive any BTC (via any method) and determine how much that BTC was worth in USD the moment you received it. That's easy to do when you buy it from a person or exchange. Not so easy when you mine it or sell stuff directly for BTC.
Then at tax time, you need to report all of your mining income as income in USD (even if you're only holding it) and any BTC you spent or sold that went up more than 50 cents in value while you were holding it. You will then pay another 42% on the gains made while holding the BTC you got rid of, 23% if you can prove that you held the BTC in a separate wallet for over a year before spending it.
If you mine with a Cointerra, get paid, say $6 every 14 hours, and then spend $1,000 at Overstock or Tiger, do you have any idea how you would report that next April? You've got mining income in there, a whole bunch of BTC that all had different cost basis values, and for each $6 mined, you'd have to figure out if THAT $6 worth of BTC appreciated by more than 50 cents while you held it and if so, write down the date you earned each $6, how much it was worth that day, the day you sold or spent it, how much it was worth that day, and how much it appreciated while you held it. 
Once people start to realize that that's how BTC works in the US today, all that's going to have to go away before some reaching some utopia here.

You're off to a good start. You have a wallet now. If you visit the "My Money" page and click "Deposit" that's your deposit address and QR. Scroll down to the Withdraw section and click "Send" and that's where you can enter any valid bitcoin address to send bitcoin out of the ChangeTip network. Of course, ChangeTip would rather you send tips to other users instead of using the withdraw function.
To that end, you won't be able to deposit too much using the deposit address above. You can always receive more tips but you won't be able to deposit more for tipping until you lower your balance by giving out tips or sending money out to a regular wallet using the withdraw function.

No, transferring BTC does not expose the private key. The whole system would break down if sending funds exposed the private key. You can even create transactions offline and use a connected system to transmit the transaction to the chain. 
Now if you used Mycelium to execute the transaction by scanning the Spend QR of the sending address, then yes, the Spend QR is tainted. If you import the Spend QR into Mycelium, that, too, taints the private key. If you import the Load &amp; Verify address into Mycelium as a "Watch Only" address, that does NOT taint the private key. 
Tainting is done by allowing an Internet connected device to see a Spend address. Receiving funds from an address does not cause the sending address to be tainted unless it is sent by an Internet connected device.

Sure, 5 to 10 BIP38s sounds good. Make sure your friend learns how to download the code from bitaddress.org and print them out from a PC that has been booted from a live Linux DVD (and unplugged or disconnected from the Wi-Fi). Also, use strong, unique passwords, not "Wallet1" through "Wallet10".
How about sequencing the wallets from 1 to 10. Ignore wallet 1 and make the password for wallets 2 through 10 be an MD5SUM of the first 10 chars of the prior public key plus the final 10 chars (in reverse order) of the private key from the wallet before? Would give you beautiful completely unrelated passwords, but I'm sure someone will say that's idiotic.

FYI, you should always load up your paper wallets as "Watch Only" addresses in your smartphone wallet. Even if you don't intend to spend from your phone, loading up the "Load &amp; Verify" addresses on your phone lets you keep track of your balances and gives you alerts on your phone the instant any transaction occurs against an address you have in cold storage. 
There is absolutely no risk to your balance if you scan the Load QR when adding addressees to your hot wallet -- only benefits.

I was chatting with when this idea struck. There are two ways to minimize your tax burden (U.S.) when spending BTC in a rising market -- either buy it and sell it the same day (via Gyft, for instance) or being able to prove that you sat on the BTC in a certain address for one year before spending it.
Here is a 4-pack of letter sized inserts with twelve 2"x2" pockets on each sheet. Label each sheet with "Year 1" through "Year 4" and then label each pocket with "January" through "December". Stick $50 in BTC paper wallets in one new pocket a month. Write the date and purchase price on the paper wallet before you stick it in the pocket. When you circle around to the first pocket you filled you can start spending the money. Just wait for day 366. The key is to not spend any BTC between 24 hours and 365 days old (if the price is climbing). That's where you pay the highest capital gains taxes on top of any sales tax you're already paying in the purchase. When you spend a paper wallet, write the date and value on the paper and keep that (and the address) handy for tax time. 
Use the next three sheets for bonus "retirement planning". It won't reduce your tax load any further, but if the price rises a LOT, you can split up a year old paper wallet and move whatever you don't want to spend to a NEW paper wallet tucked into the same month in the next year in the rotation. Of course, don't over report -- don't report the portion of the balance you just rolled into the same pocket next year. You don't owe on the gains made with it just because you moved it to a fresh paper wallet. If you rollover less than $50 to the same month next year, supplement the pocket with another paper wallet to make up the difference.
Don't mix BTC with different purchase dates and prices in the same long term wallet. Each wallet should only be loaded and emptied once. This is for ease of recordkeeping. Similarly, your short term hot wallet should be empty at the end of every day. Only load BTC into it that you plan to spend right away. That way all your short term BTC will have the same cost basis and incur no tax and you won't mix your long term and short term BTC, thus muddying the waters. You may also wish to spend your short and long term BTC via different hot wallets, like Blockchain and Mycelium if you have trouble keeping it all straight.
Just keep up the program and each month you'll have some cheap BTC to spend. 
Remember, never spend a portion of a paper wallet. Always transfer all of it into your hot wallet and then load up new paper wallets for any excess you don't feel safe sitting in your hot wallet.

I guess I should have used Confession Bear with the fact that I was even thinking about it. When you walk past dozens of racks stuffed with blade servers waiting to go to the recycler, your mind starts to wander. 
Also, now that GPU mining is done and we've had several million more transactions that have generated change addresses, one has to wonder if that math has been revisited. 
This is just a crazy shower thought, so I joined in to participate in the hypotheticals, that's all. Forget I said "at work" and pretend I said "AWS images" images. Finally, don't you want to be absolutely certain that the math behind it all checks out? Don't you want to open all the curtains, checking to make sure you never find the wizard?

1) Instant. It was from account to account via teller.
2) Each place was within a few blocks of each other in Philly.
3) WF, like most big banks, now has a PayPal-like feature. I could add him as a transfer payee in my web account and pay him instantly right from my phone. Of course I wouldn't be able to get a new license plate for the car at 8pm on a Sunday, so he would take his plate off and I wouldn't be able to drive it anywhere (legally).
Again, this whole thing was convenient ONLY because we did the transaction at a time that was good for the bank and the auto tag shop. He's a small-time exporter, not a big fancy dealership.

Read the FAQ on this sub and head on over to Bitcoin, the technology, has many uses, one of which enables people to exchange balances with one another, just like money. You don't actually "get" anything physical. Everyone who participates in the system simply agrees as to how much value is assigned to each party. Instead of receiving a physical object, you instead possess a secret that enables you to transfer some or all of your balance to someone else.
The easiest way to get some Bitcoin (aside from people giving it to you via changetip) is to buy some with cash. You may either buy some from someone who is selling it in person or (if you're in the US) buy some via coinbase or circle.
Be prepared to spend a couple thousand dollars if you want to help create some more Bitcoin. For that money, it appears you can expect to receive about $40 a month worth of Bitcoin -- and decreasing -- if you're lucky.
-=-=-=-=-= GROWN UP TALK BELOW =-=-=-=-=-
Finally, no matter how you obtain it, make absolutely sure that you write down how much you receive or purchase each time, the date, and how much it was worth the moment you received it. You will need that information at tax time. If you spend any Bitcoin and the value of the amount you spent has increased by more than 50 cents during the time you held it, you will need to report it and pay the feds a slice of that increase.
For instance, say you buy $100 worth and in six months it becomes worth $110. You spend $25 worth. It only cost you $22.75 to buy it. You made $2.25 in six months just by holding onto it. Because you held it less than a year, you will owe an additional 94 cents on your taxes in April. There are people out there who earned 10's of thousands of dollars (or more) worth of Bitcoin years ago and went nuts spending it all, thinking it was free money. Don't fall into that trap.
Don't be silly, you're not going to get tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars in free money five years from now -- the reporting requirements are real, however, but ONLY if the value of the Bitcoin you hold goes up between the time you buy it and spend it.

I've been studying this for months, but I still carry the original "moron" moniker. If we know how many coins will be mined approximately every 10 minutes through the year 2140, how is it that difficult to make a formula in Excel that you can just copy down and see the number now through the end?
How many bitcoins have been mined is about the only aspect of this that we can reliably predict for over a hundred years, IMHO. Please explain if you don't mind.

@_date: 2014-05-27 18:20:23
Thank you for this. When the IRS advice came, I thought I clearly understood that:
a) You must pick one method to calculate the value and use a reputable source, such as Coinbase; you cannot change data sources over time to suit your needs such as trying to enhance losses or minimize gains, and
b) When referring to those sources for a daily price, they report one average price for the day.
When I travel internationally for work and spend money using my credit card, I can go to a web site and find out what the exchange rate was for that particular day and use that for expense reporting. If I incur ten different charges during the course of the day, I only need to use one exchange rate throughout the day. I don't need to pull up a chart that shows the exchange rate hour-by-hour.
Now, of course, all this is related to submitting travel expenses at work and not about reporting personal gains or losses to the IRS, which is a different beast. Are you saying that I will not be able to report one exchange rate for a given date, thus making my capital gains zero? What about the 50c difference? If my gains (or losses) equate to 50c or less in a given transaction, that rounds down to zero, correct?
For these short term purchases aiming to result in no chargeable gains or losses, I see myself buying $100 of BTC  and using it to load up gift cards at Gyft within an hour or so. Sure, there may be a few dollars' difference in the exchange rates at time of purchase and sale, but based on the small amounts I would be moving, I expect the capital gains would be 50c or less. I just can't go through a buy/sell cycle on a day that is showing $50 gains in share value. It will start to add up.
It sounds like you're saying that I need to be more careful than just making the purchases and sales on the same day -- I need to make sure that the exchange rates are so close that the gains will result in 50c or less. That's the only way I will have 0 capital gains on short term purchases -- make sure the purchase and sale prices don't vary so much that the gains will exceed 50c. Even if there's a $30 jump from $650 to $680, and I buy and sell $100 worth of BTC, the total capital gains is $4.60, incurring $1.90 of short term capital gains tax (if I'm correct and it's 42%). We also both know that it will take a massive jump to overcome all the fees and overhead induced at both the purchase and sale to still result in a $30 jump. That's a big jump when you're trying to buy and sell as quickly as possible. I get your point, though, in that it's not as simple as declaring one price for the entire day.
My ultimate goal is to legally avoid the short term tax rate as much as possible -- by using LIFO and cold storage for 366+ day storage, I should be able to buy BTC and sell via Gyft in rapid succession, resulting in near-zero short term gains each time. I feel like I'm close, but I don't want any surprises to show up.
See my post from today showing some clear sheets I found with twelve pockets on each page. Perfect for rotating through 12 months a year for four years.. makes it very easy to determine which BTC is &gt;365 days and safe to spend.

@_date: 2014-09-27 01:33:17
That's mostly correct. You are certainly using Bitcoin, but Coinbase isn't telling anyone else about transactions that you execute entirely within their accounting books.
When you purchase BTC with Coinbase, they hold it for you and only keep track of how much belongs to you. You don't even have the private keys. They just agree to let you transfer out of their system any amount up to that amount they agree you have stored with them. That's why most purists argue vehemently against using web wallets, and that's also the main issue that led to the collapse of Mt. Gox. People trusted Gox and Gox screwed them. Now of course Gox and Coinbase are vastly different entities, but at their cores, they operate using the same principles. Coinbase just brings certain Wall St practices to the business model -- provable reserves, KYC/AML, etc.
Once you transfer BTC out of Coinbase, only then does your transaction hit the blockchain. If you execute thousands of transfers between yourself, other Coinbase end users and even pay merchants entirely within Coinbase's books, are you using Bitcoin? Sure. As intended by Satoshi? Ehhhh....
@_date: 2014-06-09 22:59:51
When you swipe your card (or scan your verify QR) that lets the pump see that you have a balance available to pay the bill. Today, the transaction isn't closed until you finish pumping and the bill is sent to the credit card processor. I thought the simile I built was pretty close. Not to mention as I'm cruising America's highways and byways, I see "Drive offs will be prosecuted" on the outermost pumps all the time. I don't believe I've tried in many years, but there must be a way to start the pump before verifying your ability to pay. 
@_date: 2014-05-26 14:59:25
Thanks for your comment. I was aware that Gyft sells BTC into fiat. That's actually my main point. To get in and out of BTC on the same day. When reporting transactions to the IRS, you need to choose an exchange to use when indicating the price of BTC/USD on a given date. There is only one average price per day according to an exchange. When reporting your transactions to the IRS, you need to indicate the date of purchase, the exchange rate on that day, the date you sold, the rate on THAT day and therefore the increase (or decrease) in value that the BTC experienced duriing the time you held it.
Therefore if you buy and sell BTC on the same day, both sides of the transaction had the same "cost basis". No change in value of the BTC means no capital gains tax to pay. You could also buy and sell on two entirely different dates with roughly the same exact average value for that day and achieve the same thing, but you can't guarantee you will ever see the purchase price return again in the future.
To answer your question, yes, in the US, capital gains are taxed at two different rates -- a very high rate (42%?) for property kept less than a year and a lower rate (28%? 23%?) for property kept longer than a year. That's what led to my analysis above -- keep the long term holdings for many years so that when you eventually spend it, gains will be taxed at a lower rate, while buy and spend the other BTC in the same day. That's the only way to avoid the 42% short term gains rate.
Thanks again for the warning about Gyft transferring to fiat right away -- I understand. My goal is to put an "air gap" between my bank account and vendors such as Amazon and Target. I missed the Target hack by three days and I would love it if I never had to worry like that again. If I could buy BTC over morning coffee, transfer it to Gyft at lunch and hit the Target on the way home that evening without ever having to worry about Target being hacked again, that would be perfect, IMHO.
Thank you for your other tips as well, they did not go unnoticed. I did see the recent tax modules announced and will look further into them. I wasn't so much starting a discussion about making reporting easier as much as I want to legally minimize my tax load.

Mining is not profitable for individuals anymore. You will need to buy thousands of dollars' worth of equipment and spend hundreds of dollars per month in electricity in order to earn under $50 a month in Bitcoin. If you want to build up your balances, you are much better off just buying some at Coinbase or from people selling BTC using apps and websites like LocalBitcoin and Mycelium.
Be advised, though, that regulations are catching up to how easily Bitcoin can be used as a substitute for money, so companies and people who will sell you BTC are required to gather more and more information about you. You may be put off by the amount of personally identifiable information companies ask for, but that is just them staying within the regulations. Individuals generally don't collect that kind of information, but who knows how much longer that is going to last.

Gas has come and gone with the Walmart cards appearing on Gyft, so I think it is currently on the "not available" list. And no, one gas station near Boulder or Colorado Springs or whatever doesn't count.

It was the best term I could come up with for someone watching from a car with binocs or something. Wait for the buyer to verify the balance and then sweep the balance after the cash exchange but before the buyer can sweep it. See my other comment somewhere in here about doing it in stages. Spread the sale out over five paper wallets, for instance. The first wallet is empty when you, the buyer, go to sweep it? Something's up and you bail on the rest of the trade.

Thank you for clarifying. How is reward halving fixed? By date? By blocks processed? If based on blocks processed, that tells me it's relatively dynamic, save for the fact that the algorithm is designed to adjust itself so that a new block is found approximately every 10 minutes. So even if it is somewhat flexible, you can generally tell the date at which it will half again.

I've seen you make this assertion twice now. I respectfully disagree. Bit just means a 1 or a 0. BitTorrent was developed because the prior generation of file sharing utilities couldn't fill a receiving party's downlink pipe with a single file. By making everyone who wants to download a large file at once coordinate with one another by simultaneously sending small chunks of the overall file to one another, everyone's uplink and downlink pipes were stuffed with bits. A torrent is a simple word that just means a massive amount of something flowing (think river with whitecaps or a major rainstorm).
When BitTorrent was released it represented a massive increase in the amount of data that could be shared between interested parties. It literally released a "torrent of bits". Same for Bitcoin. It behaves like coins, but is made up entirely of digital information.
Ones and zeroes. Has nothing to do with centralized or decentralized. A bit can be a one or a zero. It's data. It's digital.

Good writeup. I'm also of the opinion that we may settle into a pattern where people use Jalapenos in place of small F2F purchases. Say I pay 7c/kWh, and may only want to buy about $20 USD/mo in BTC. The question is how much in fees I would be willing to be pay for "x" number of buys per month and how does that compare to the excess charges I would be paying to my electric company.
The comparison between the increase in my electric bill and the convenience and fees I would pay for F2F buys may be a wash.

Historically, people like to use safe deposit boxes as a metaphor for Bitcoin addresses. But these boxes are clear, extremely secure and out in the open -- not locked in the back of a bank. They have unique serial numbers on the outside and deposit slots. Anyone can deposit money into any box and can also see the balance of any box at any time. There are matching keys linked to every box. The serial number on each key corresponds to the serial number listed on the box that key can open. You can calculate the number on the box using the number on the key but you absolutely cannot determine the number on the key just by looking at the number on the box. Anyone can see how much money is inside the box, but no one can open them without the key that you possess.
As Bitcoin matured, it became the norm for software to change the address (use a different box) after each transaction.. no matter whether spending or receiving BTC. So each time you spend BTC, you remove the entire balance from the box that was holding your balance at the time, put some in a different box -- say, one owned by another person -- and then put the remaining balance in another box that you own. Then each time someone wants to send some BTC to you, your software knows the NEXT box you're going to use and tells you the address. That way, when the BTC arrives, the software will again remove the entire balance from the box currently holding your balance, add the new incoming BTC to it, and then put the entire new balance in the next box.
If I described that clearly enough,  you'll soon see why most people around here talk about the importance of using a new address for each transaction. If someone happens to see you put money in a box, they may not know whether its a box you own or not, but they'll know how much is in there. Then, by constantly moving parts and pieces of your entire balance to new boxes every time you touch your BTC, that person may come back to check the balance in the box they saw you use but it is now empty; the balances are long gone. They can see where the bits and pieces of your balance went to various other boxes, but unless they see you using the key to unlock a specific box they have no idea whatsoever about the relationship between you and the box or boxes they know are somehow tied to you. It very quickly becomes difficult to "follow the money" as it splits and rejoins other BTC in numerous other somewhat anonymous boxes.
When you see people talking about the "12 words" around here, that is a mechanism that makes it easy for your software to calculate millions of addresses to use when moving your balances around. On their own, the addresses appear to be completely unrelated to one another, so it is impossible to figure out all of the addresses you have already used or plan to use just by looking at any number of the addresses. They will never give away their pattern. It is much safer to use a different address each time you send and receive BTC and it is much safer to use a list of 12 words to generate the list of all of the addresses you will eventually use.
Hope this helps, but I understand if it doesn't :)

If you show up at a buy and the seller hands you a paper wallet, do two things:
1) check the balance and make sure it's been there for at least an hour, with several confirmations, and
2) sweep the balance into your own hot wallet, chatting over coffee while the confirmations come in
Never leave with 0 confirmations and never trust cold storage where the seller has seen the private key. You could also show up with your own cold storage paper that you have loaded up as a watch address and ask the seller to load up that address. 
Almost forgot. This is also a great reason to get a Piper. If you do a lot of transactions on paper, you can print a new wallet every 45 seconds or so.

22% is about the minimum that people in the U.S. pay on every transaction where the gains made between purchase and sale exceed 50 cents. That's only if the user held the BTC in a wallet for over one year and can prove it. 43% on the gains if you can't prove you held the BTC in a wallet for more than a year!
People in the U.S. should consider using a hot wallet on their phone for short term BTC bought (or mined) and sold quickly and provably separate storage (i.e. paper wallets in cold storage) for long term BTC being held over a year.
22% is normal for Americans, but only those who plan properly. Taking it out of the transaction automatically? That's not cool.

U.S. I travel 45 weeks a year for work, usually eating out 2-3 meals 5-6 days a week. Been doing this 14 years, and I honestly can't name a single time someone swiped a card at my table. I feel like I've seen it before, but I seriously cannot recall for sure.
It would be great if each bill had a QR code for a single use only Bitcoin address, with a payment request encoded within. Then I could pay immediately with all the benefits of Bitcoin and not watch my card disappear for a minute or two. Someone fraudulently charged my aunt $5,000 after stealing her card details at a restaurant.

I assume you know the address where it needs to be deposited. Make sure you have the deposit address available for copy/paste on your phone.
    1) Sign up at LibertyX.com.
    2) Go to LibertyX.com/locations and type in your zip code in the search field. There are locations all around Center City (I'm in Bucks).
    3) Go to a store on the website, ask to buy $50 in LibertyX from the QPay Network. They will only take cash and give you a receipt.
    4) Go to LibertyX.com/store on your phone, click Redeem a PIN code. Enter the PIN code on the receipt and then paste the address that is expecting your payment into the Bitcoin address field.
    5) Done. You just paid someone $50 in Bitcoin.
LibertyX doesn't charge a fee for the first $1,000 you buy from them. If you want to get more involved in Bitcoin and start keeping some for yourself, then go ahead and install a phone based wallet and spend time learning more about it. This right here is the quickest way to pay your bill without having to get too deeply involved in Bitcoin. No meeting people at a coffee shop. No depositing money in a bank branch waiting for the Bitcoin to come to your wallet first before you turn around and transfer it.
You put $50 on the counter and get a receipt. Enter the PIN code and Bitcoin address on a website on your phone and you're done.
Note that is only works perfectly in this situation because you're located near several LibertyX locations and you need to send $50. LibertyX only sells Bitcoin in $50 to $300 tranches, so with any other balance that is not on a perfect $50 boundary, you would have to do all the other stuff that everyone else is suggesting. But since you need to send $50 and are near several stores, you don't have to do any of that other stuff. You can turn $50 cash into $50 in Bitcoin immediately at the store without installing any software. You'll even get an email receipt, something you don't normally get when you pay someone straight from your Bitcoin wallet.

I'm sure this part of the process is legal. There's likely a reason your coworker's friend doesn't want to be seen on bank video cameras making deposits into that account. Especially if your coworker is receiving cash in hand to do this.

Yikes. Can you back up that statement? Are you sure you didn't mean that the regulatory structure is in place this time around? The vast majority of money in bank accounts (investment money) isn't FDIC insured. Which BTC exchanges are?

I could :) luckily, it took me down the road of learning about paper wallets first, giving me a much broader view of the whole ecosystem. I still think very few people get that you can carry slips of paper with you that are worthless until you load a value up on them (optionally) using your cellphone. That you get to decide how much each piece of paper money in your pocket is worth the moment you hand it over. That's a very powerful concept.

I wonder if Satoshi expected a more unified growth in both hashing power and transactions. That maybe he underestimated the arms war that would ensue in the mad grab for money well ahead of the transaction volume. Now we may find ourselves in a situation where the hashing power greatly exceeds the requirements driven by the transaction volume. 
Of course, I'm still using a Moron Monday throwaway, so I may be confusing the increase in difficulty vs the halving of the reward as being based on overall hashing power.

I appreciate the level headed response. As I learned from another reply, Circle does the same thing. Same with ItBit, the new BitLicense registered exchange. I first started studying Bitcoin in Nov '13 but didn't buy any until this year. I've only heard horror stories about trying to buy in the early days. 
While it does indicate a certain level of maturity in the industry, being FDIC insured does only protect the USD side of the account as you said, and only against certain types of loss of funds. I read into it thinking that you thought BTC balances were protected against exit scams (or anything, really) which you clearly did not. 
TIL! Thanks! That's pretty cool.

Assuming you're in the U.S., that's going to be tough to do. Any business that has gone through the trouble and expense of setting up that business is not going to risk losing everything by not following the laws expressly designed to govern businesses that store or transmit large sums of money, especially if that business also exchanges values between two unlike systems. 
Sorry, but governments have really started to crack down on people and businesses that allow individuals to create an "end of the line" for their money trail. You may not have those intentions in mind, but try to take a minute and think like a criminal who doesn't want anyone to know how much money they currently have or in the past once possessed. No better way than to do exactly what you're saying you want to do.

The new standard for using a new address after every transaction is not followed properly by Mycelium for Apple devices.
Weird issues like this come up quite often, and it is pointed out each time that two different development teams are building the Android and iOS versions independently of one another.

Since I'll never get around to doing it, I've wanted an app that shows how much BTC is safe to spend from a tax perspective i.e. it had been held longer than a year or shows how much BTC can be spent that hasn't increased in value more than 50c while I've held it. No one seems to approach it from the perspective of minimizing the tax bill, so I'm happy to see someone thinking about it. 
Edit: In a similar vein, highlight balances in my wallet that have just barely declined in value since purchase. Since we agree that virtually everyone ignores the tax implications, this would be a great way to show how much BTC you can spend without losing your shirt while also not being burdened with reporting requirements. If you bought $500 in BTC and it was only worth $499 when you spent it, it's still not a reportable event. Hardly anyone gets this.

If you had said "mining pools", you'd have a discussion on your hands. Just amassing BTC does not allow you to execute a double spend.

They have a lot of catching up to do, though.

There is one seller who has setup a detailed web page describing their strategy for legally avoiding registering as a money transmitter. One of the features is their refusal to sell more than $1,000 worth of BTC in a single day. 
In the Florida case, one seller sold $25,000 worth to an agent who specifically told the seller that he needed to clean the money because it was gained illegally. The agent tried to launder another $32,000 from the same seller, but the seller didn't complete the buy, thinking that the cash was counterfeit.
Those are the kinds of numbers (as well as willful ignorance of claimed illegal activities) that attract attention. The seller's actions directly translated to "I will help you clean your illegal money."

Bitwage makes it set it and forget it. Stupid easy. But they aim to charge 2% per transaction plus $10/mo if you don't receive your entire paycheck in BTC. I have multiple direct deposit feeds, so I convert the entire smaller one to avoid the monthly fee. 
So much easier than hunting around for a 1.5% LibertyX store which is almost impossible to find anymore. Almost.

I would say yes. Gyft changes it to dollars and then buys the card. There's no way I would argue that doesn't happen. That's also why I start a new wallet for each BTC purchase and name it with the purchase price. I have BTC to spend anywhere from $200 to the ATH day the other day. If I want to spend, I just spend BTC that I bought at or just below the current price. As always, document, document, document. 
@_date: 2014-06-02 22:09:19
Since this is a public ledger, all transactions are executed against the current state. You don't actually move BTC around among addresses -- any movement is simply listed on the ledger (something that took me a while to get). Therefore, a completed block "certifies" all of the transactions that have occurred up to that moment in time. Also, the cryptographic hash of a completed block serves as the starting point of the next block. It serves as a way to guarantee all of the transactions that have been accepted once and for all globally.
@_date: 2014-06-11 16:58:15
Yup. It still sucks that the $20,000 car could have really cost him up to $28,400 depending on how long he held the BTC, and that only 10 people around here get that. That's a worst case scenario, assuming it was all paid for with investment gains made within the last year.

Go to bitaddress.org, generate a wallet, click Wallet Details, paste in the private address you received and click View Details. You now have the associated QR codes for the private key you were given. Scroll down to "Private key WIF", grab your phone and sweep the balance by QR. That's to save you the Google search. As for the uninitiated? I don't know how to explain that to someone who just saw the word "Bitcoin" for the first time ever 30 seconds ago.
Before anyone yells "it's unsafe!" remember -- it's $5. Think about how many times people come traipsing through here to tell us that Bitcoin will never work because it takes 10-30 minutes to confirm a payment on a cup of coffee. Different balances require different levels of security to protect the funds, just like cash.
Oh, and to your second point, if someone came out of the woods in a torrent environment and told me to log onto a website using the included credentials to collect $5, I guarantee you I would never collect those funds.

I've long said that the LibertyX location map should be used as a "heat map" showing where the efforts you're describing should be focused. You and people like you could invite the owners of the shop and nearby businesses to develop a marketing strategy.

If you're looking at the price of goods priced in BTC, are you sure it doesn't have anything to do with merchants still learning how to think natively in terms of BTC? We just saw a post within the last day or two of an online shop that is selling a $20 toy helicopter for $72,000 because their pricing mechanism is completely broken. 
Think about your neighborhood coffee shop. They're going to write prices on a chalkboard. Do you think they're going to update their prices in BTC once a week? Day? Hour? No way. So as the exchange rate drops, that coffee gets more expensive by the hour or by the day. That's the shop's inability to keep up with price fluctuations, IMHO, not inflation.

I'm forced to change half a dozen passwords every 3-6 months at work. I often use a phrase that describes something going on at that time, such as "I really hate my commute this year" or IRH8MCTY. Do you remember when you set the password, and if that's also your style, what was going on back then? Maybe you were reading a book and constructed a password from the title, title+author or a phrase in the book that really caught your eye?
EDIT: Looking at the transaction history, it appears it was almost exactly one year ago. I haven't pulled up the charts, but wasn't November of last year the peak? All within the span of a few hours, you transferred in a small test amount, then a very large amount, bringing it to almost exactly 4.5 BTC. Then you almost cleared it out completely an hour later. Think about what that big transaction was. Maybe the phrase was related to the purpose of that transaction.
EDIT 2: According to Coinbase, all of this happened the day before the peak. You put in about $4,800 and then cleaned it out, leaving $257 behind (which is now worth $90). (Sorry for all the USD, you'll have to come up with your local currency values). Maybe you setup a temp wallet solely to execute a large purchase? A car? A trip? A ridiculously nice TV? Or did you sell some off in Localbitoins to get some holiday spending money? Did you spend any time thinking, "thank God I got out of all that BTC the day before the peak"?

Mycelium on Android supports watch only wallets nicely, both single use and HD.
I created an HD wallet on my Ledger Nano and imported the xpubkey to Bitwage and Mycelium. Now Bitwage sends each deposit to a new address protected by my Nano and I can safely monitor the balance right on my phone.

"You don't need to be near a computer to receive coins likewise with email. But you do need to be at one to send them to someone else."
Unless you hand them a paper wallet, of course. It's in the recipient's best interest to check the balance and empty that paper wallet right away, but if all you have is a paper wallet and no computer, you can still give someone that paper wallet (and thus the entire balance).
Heck, if you wanted to stay really low key, you could just build or buy a Piper and show up at all your buy and sell sessions with nothing but paper wallets. You'd have to trust the person on the other side of the table quite a bit, though.

If you're going to buy through a business (especially in the US) there has been a tightening of the rules governing how they are allowed to operate. They *must* go to great lengths to know everything they can about customers' financial dealings. You're hearing from everyone here that LocalBitcoins.com and the Mycelium app on Android is the best way to find local sellers who may (or may not) be held to those same regulations.
The rules apply to the sell side, not the buy side, so you don't have to worry as a buyer. Federal agencies are starting to setup sting operations, though, where they seek out sellers who are not following the rules and regulations that apply to sellers. The biggest stories circulate around big time unregistered sellers, though -- like $25,000 to $30,000 worth of BTC. I haven't heard stories about small time sellers getting nabbed.

make it three words and give one word to each of three people in your will -- or -- write the three words onto small snips of paper and hide one word into the folds of each paper wallet before laminating and distributing the copies. then, at execution, everyone cuts open their laminated wallet and out pops one of three (or more) words in the password. the words are sequenced by the age of the holders.

And to be honest, after the arrests in Florida, I can even see the private face-to-face market for exchanges drying up. If that market dries up, then I'm concerned about where new users will be able to get BTC. We've been hearing horror stories about Coinbase blocking new users even before their first purchase. So, for an extreme example, without Coinbase and without the private purchase market, what's left? Huge mining firms, with perilously few options for transferring the BTC to the public, aside from jumping through all those hoops.

It's funny because my understanding of how Bitcoin feels was somewhat stalled until I printed out some paper wallets at Bitaddress.org. As soon as I printed the sheet and cut them out into the size of traditional money,  that's when I got it. 
I used to think that I would seek out the Bitcoin equivalent of a bank account, but when you hold a paper wallet, you realize that it can also behave like paper money that has no value until you load some money on it. Each address can replace both a "bank account" and paper money in your leather wallet. 
Add to that the fact that the Blockchain can replace Western Union, credit and debit cards worldwide and (in the next generation, so much more) and you suddenly start to realize just how amazing the whole thing really is. It's mind blowing.

Thanks for the thanks. I didn't invent the "clear boxes" model, but I did write that description myself.
I'm not a Dark Net Market (often abbreviated 'DNM') kind of guy, but I was on alt.cypherpunks in the years leading up to the first announcement. Everyone should read The Cyphernomicon to get a feel for the sort of stuff that was brewing in the 90s. They knew that once computers became fast enough, something like this was going to be available to the masses. 
I feel like BTC exploded on the DNM scene before change addresses became the norm. That's probably why some of the early, big name people have been jailed. Everyone foolishly thought it was anonymous money until doors started getting kicked in around the world. 
Using the same IP address to repeatedly move BTC earned from illegal activities into the same Bitcoin address is like a Christmas present to the feds if they know you're up to no good and are building a case against you.

In the US, it matters how much each group of BTC (tranche) was worth when you bought it, how much it was worth when you sold it, how much value it gained (or lost) while you held it and how long you held it if it increased in value while you held it.
All BTC purchases I make go into HD separate wallets named for their price. I only spend from a given wallet when Bitstamp shows the current exchange rate a little lower than my purchase price. That guarantees I lose (a little) value every time I spend. For each transaction, I log how much in USD each spend was worth and the Bitstamp rate at the moment I spent. Unless you give me something like [Coin]( then I can't control which tranche of BTC I'm spending and the accounting can be a nightmare.
Imagine if your capital gains on BTC held went up or down for each spend? Sometimes WITHIN a single purchase? Say you spend $50.18. You may have gained $1.50 on the first $28.75, lost $3 on the next $6.50, gained $1.18 on the next $10, lost $0.75 on the last $3.75. Yikes. No thanks.

What you're downloading has already been verified. The basic idea is that for your node to know the balance available in every address, it needs to know every transaction that has moved balances into and between addresses. So you're just downloading every transaction that has already been verified as having occurred. Once your node has caught up to every transaction, it knows the balance in every address. And it will periodically need to catch up in order to keep up.
This is why you'll hear advice to run your own node if you run a business that accepts BTC. You don't have to ask anyone else for the balance available in the address that is trying to send you a payment. You can figure it out instantly if your node is caught up.

During this time each year, colleges and universities who at least had a halfway decent year playing American Football get to play in a series of bowl games to determine the best of the best among groups of schools. 
The bowl games are sponsored by businesses who buy naming rights. Last night they played the bitcoin bowl, sponsored by BitPay. BitPay is getting mad props for not only putting bitcoin first, but also for running several high quality ads. The ads were released to YouTube almost to the second that they aired on TV -- just another cool aspect of watching the game with my laptop.

Many people don't realize that in the US, Bitcoin users are required to calculate how much their Bitcoin increased in value between the time they bought or mined it and sold or spent it, and then pay the IRS a portion of the increase in value if it increased more than 50 cents while you held it. 
When you donate to certain types of non profit organizations, you can donate the BTC and not pay the taxes on any increase in value the BTC may have experienced. Additionally, you can use the donation to offset gains you may have made with other BTC that you used to make purchases. Make sure you speak with a tax professional before trying to lower your tax bill by making a donation to make sure you're doing it right. 
For example, you must be able to prove that you've had that BTC for over a year, which you can generally only do if you maintain separate long term and short term wallets.

Came here to write what wrote. I'd like to hear more about why it seems you don't think transferring paper wallets is analog to cash. In order to keep the examples truly simple, I show people how paper wallets are like cash, but don't have any value until you take a picture of it with your phone. You get to decide how much each piece of paper is worth right before you hand it over.
In other words, I totally pictured a poker kitty full of paper wallets. Why didn't you? Not attacking you, just honestly asking. Do you feel that until the recipient sweeps the balance on each of the paper wallets it's not really _theirs_? I would love to see a poker kitty consisting entirely of folded and sealed paper wallets. That, to me, says that Bitcoin has arrived.

Yes, but completely unrelated words, in the same corner of each page. Since each page has four corners, you could use the same corner for the sequence of words for four different wallets.

I'd love to see you rewrite this replacing the $100 Trezor with a $20 Ledger HW.1. Same technology as the $30 Nano, but with no nonsense packaging. FAR more functional than a simple USB key.  You cannot initialize it on a compromised computer but you can use it on one. The private keys never leave the device and the device performs a secure 2FA via your cellphone. If you lose the device, you can reinitialize your word list on commonly available software, and you can do secure multisig with Coinkite.
If you're going to use a $1 USB drive, I'd suggest bootable Tails with Electrum over storing multiple single use keys on a doubly-encrypted drive. There's nothing to encrypt because there's nothing stored. Don't worry about a key logger because they include an On Screen Keyboard. If you can memorize 12 specific words in a specific sequence, you now have greatly improved security and privacy and many millions of addresses at your beck and call.
HW.1 if you can spend $20, Tails USB if you can only spend $1.

It depends on the type of phone you have, the balances you have or plan to keep, whether or not and the ways you plan to spend BTC and how paranoid you are about having your BTC stolen. 
I, too, have an Android and I love Mycelium. We've heard from numerous people that BreadWallet is the way to go on iOS. Both are great for "walking around money", whatever that number is for you -- it's different for everyone. Both are very safe, and the nightmare stories we hear around here never involve them. 
Some people prefer to maintain their balances on a PC. In that case, the most highly recommended client is Electrum. Many people are still reading older tutorials that direct them to install Bitcoin Core. That is the original client and it includes certain extra functionality that plays a key role in improving the capacity and safety and security of Bitcoin as a whole. Unfortunately, that client is not written with the new end user in mind, and unless you make associated changes to your network configuration at home, you're actually harming the Bitcoin ecosystem instead of helping it. 
There is also another class of wallets: hardware wallets. Trezor and the Ledger product lines are the heavy hitters here. They are devices that are designed to protect your private keys at all costs, even to the point of never letting you see them. If you can't get to your keys, then hackers can't either. They take very similar approaches to solving the problem, but with some key differences.
The Trezor has a built in screen, enabling you to verify when you try to spend your BTC that it is going to the correct address. The Ledger devices are too small for a screen, so they use your phone's display for confirming transactions. The Ledger devices are small enough to fit on your keychain and require a Chrome browser to use. You can always have your balances secure and in your possession at all times. 
The Trezor uses open source software from top to bottom, while the Ledger devices use the smartchip that has been used to protect financial transactions around the world for decades now. That chip is just starting to show up on bank cards in the USA. That smartchip is proprietary, so Ledger has only been able to open source the content outside of the secure element. In order to spend BTC from either device, you must attach it to your PCs USB port and visit a website. Each product's associated website knows how to interact with the device and request a transaction. The transaction is constructed on the device and handed back to the PC for transmission onto the Bitcoin network. You may also attach them to cellphones, but that is a fringe use case right now.
Finally, if you have very high balances and/or consider yourself fairly paranoid about the safety of your balances, there is another interesting approach. Most Bitcoin is stolen when people leave their balances on web based wallets (not websites associated with hardware wallets described above). Some victims also leave remote control software on their PC where they also manage their balances. The alternate approach below is unique in that the details for managing your balances don't exist anywhere on Earth except during the few minutes at a time where you are actually moving BTC around. 
Check out the Tails OS. It is a specialized version of Linux that is designed to protect your privacy and maintain secrecy around all of your online activity. If you configure it to boot from USB or CD and not store any data from your sessions anywhere, then all data created during each session is destroyed when you shut down and reboot your computer back into its regular operating system. 
This is significant because all of your Bitcoin balances are stored on thousands of computers around the world, not on your actual PC. The only thing you're storing locally are the keys enabling you to spend your BTC. When you pair that fact up with the fact that all modern clients use word lists to generate millions of Bitcoin addresses and that Electrum is included with Tails, you have something special.
If you can memorize 12 common words in an exact sequence, then you can boot up your PC off Tails, type in those 12 words, and establish full control of your balances. When you shut down and reboot into your regular OS, there is zero indication left behind on your PC about what you did to manage your BTC. There's no website to hack, no software on your PC that is trying to protect sensitive data, no histories in your browser that indicates what site you use to manage your balances. Nothing. 
As for me, I'm in the USA. It is important to keep track of how much you spent when buying BTC, whether or not it increased in value while you held it, and if it did increase in value while you held it, how long you held it. All of that detail goes into calculating whether or not and how much tax you owe when acquiring and spending BTC. I setup a new wallet each time I buy BTC. I name it with the date and exchange rate. Mycelium handles multiple wallets beautifully. The only downside is that all of the wallet names and notes on every transaction are lost if I lose my phone or wipe it. Airbitz is another wallet that restores all that detail when you restore after a wipe or moving to another device, but that convenience actually makes me nervous. 
I also have a tiny balance on a Ledger Nano. The Ledger devices don't natively support multiple wallets simultaneously, so I could only trust it with one huge balance purchased at one time, which isn't my typical approach. Finally, I also have a tiny balance on Tails with a memorized Electrum key. Electrum does support working with multiple wallets, but that would involve (possibly) memorizing and typing in multiple 12 word lists each time I want to move some BTC around. Like the Ledger products, that is a great way to manage one huge balance purchased at one time if you want to make life easier for you at tax time. 
tl;dr Mycelium on my phone, Ledger Nano on my keychain, and a 12 word list for Electrum on Tails in my head.

Yup. What happens when you swipe a prepaid Visa card with a $5 balance but pump $50 and drive away? Does the pump automatically stop at $5? Or do the pumps only request a "reasonable" hold? Like $50? I doubt the cashier can tell you your available balance -- only whether or not certain attempts will fail approval. Keep lowering the requested hold until it passes.
But again, on most pumps you can just hit "Cash" and wave to the cashier to get them to start the pump for you.

For a few months around the start of the school year, I proposed a system that flips it upside down. Have the school develop an altcoin. Give each student 10,000 coins. Have anyone who is running for election publish their public address. Each time voting students hear something they like from a candidate, they deposit a few coins to their name. Election time comes a few weeks later and all the balances are counted up. The highest balances competing for each seat win. Everyone can see the balances as they change throughout the course of the election cycle and "the election" itself is declaring a time at which all the balances will be counted. If a candidate decides to bow out of the face and throw their support behind another candidate, they just sweep their balance into another candidate's address.
No need to design anything other than the coin and the mobile client -- an interesting project for the comp sci kids if there is such a thing anymore.

In the US, LibertyX has partnered with thousands of small retail outlets in 33 states to facilitate buying Bitcoin with cash only. They do not charge fees on the first $1,000, 1% after that, up to $2,500 per week. The transfers are instant (due to only accepting cash) and go to a real Bitcoin address that you control, not a web wallet containing IOUs. While you can't do this at 2am, these types of shops (check cashing stores, prepaid cellular outlets) tend to be open long after banks close.
Cash on the counter, BTC transfer starts before you leave the counter let alone the store.

Just yesterday someone asked about getting a text message whenever a payment is received by the single address that he setup at a friend's bar. My mind immediately turned to a Piper. Well, BitPay first, but Piper next if the poster didn't want to go that route. 
Any time a patron requests to pay in Bitcoin, the bartender could print out a wallet, tear it in half, and staple the Load address to the bill. Then add the Spend address as a new address in Mycelium or Bread Wallet. Much safer from a privacy perspective as well as reduced arguing about whether or not the patron paid the bill. There would only be one address to pay for a given bill, so it was either paid or it wasn't. 
At the end of the night, sweep the addresses into the main account (meaning HD wallet). Of course, this approach may cause problems if the volume gets too high and the wait staff doesn't want to get their tips paid out in BTC. All in all, the Piper would be awesome here.

Seriously. It would be so easy to write a script to gen some key pairs and Load QRs for the bottles. Then, when the guests return bottles for recycling, scan them in and have a Wheel of Fortune-like spinner put a few thousand bits on a bottle. Hmm. But then the owner would have to keep the bottles and cases aligned with the user, which would be a pain.
How about this? Help friends install a wallet app. Run a randomized deposit script to load random bits on each bottle, with one big winner for the night. Distribute the bottles with the individual Load QRs on them. Then when each bottle is returned, the guest scans the bottle and their own Load QR for a "random refund" (and one big winner). 
Saves you from waking up to bottles littered all over the house!

It was in the nice neighborhood where the last third of Scarface (83) was shot. Really nice area. I was confused the first week, though and set my alarm to wake up at 3am to refill the meter. It only took a day or two to realize that I only needed to pay through 8pm in order to stay in the spot through 8am. It was real smooth once I got the hang of it, and it worked all over the city so it was handy.
I still think your idea of a QR code for each spot works well. It also keeps the complexity way down. You could hang a poster behind plexiglas in each block with a QR for each spot. Load up the address with BTC and send a satoshi with "cancel" in the comments to shut off the spend. I like it.

She was deleting files using her laptop while he was browsing them.

I learned to memorize at least one set of mine. There is a pre-configured version of Linux called Tails that is designed to be booted up from a USB flash drive. Tails is designed to leave very little trace of what you do on the Internet each time you use it and forget everything you did every time you shut it down. They recently added Electrum to the list of installed applications. It is ready to go once you finish booting up and click Login, but it knows nothing about you or your Bitcoin balances until you enter your seed words. It becomes easier to memorize your words if you have to enter them every single time you boot up. Free. Extremely safe. Completely effective.

After beginning to study it in Nov/13, creating an account here in May/14 (cake day soon!), I bought my first BTC in Jan/15 one morning and bought a cup of coffee that same afternoon with some of that BTC, pondering what the future will hold.
I even tried to join a meetup that night, but I never found the group at the restaurant and the tablet running BitPay crashed when I tried to pay for dinner with BTC.

It's not direct, but Amazon gift cards are among the easiest things to buy with BTC. Gyft app.
@_date: 2015-05-12 18:24:07
When using Bitcoin Core, the app will generate a series of addresses to use for sending and receiving BTC. In order for the app to know how much BTC is in your addresses, it must first download every single transaction that has ~~ever~~ occurred over the last year or so. Once it is caught up, the app will know not only how much BTC is in every single address that has a balance, but it will also know the path each satoshi took to get there. That's a lot of data to download.
A lot of people fall into the trap of installing Core, giving out their receive address to learn how to receive and send BTC, and then freak out when the BTC doesn't show up for four days. There are other wallets out there for every platform imaginable that do not need to wait so long to get started sending and receiving BTC nor do they need to take up tens of gigs of hard disk space. That would never work on a phone.

I don't know how far they can take cell phone searches these days. Could they detain me if they ask me to unlock my cell phone and I refuse without seeing a warrant? If I do unlock it, can they launch Mycelium? Mycelium doesn't require you to enter your PIN code to check your balances.. only to add wallets, spend or change the name tags on wallets. What if they saw my Nano on my keychain? Can they ask me to boot up my laptop, plug in my Nano and show them my balance, all without a warrant? I don't know how far they can take it.
That leaves me with my memorized seed words in Electrum on Tails. There's no visible indicator anywhere whatsoever that I can access my funds from nearly any PC. All they can do is go through my phone and my Nano and ask "is that it?" Even if they take my phone and my Nano, I can regain those funds elsewhere and the conversation is over.

I first learned about it at the first peak. Then I studied it for a year, watched the MTGOX implosion, and started buying ad hoc at around $200. I've been buying almost weekly since last summer, and it has been interesting watching the price steadily build. 
Watching it take China's restructuring in stride was the most interesting recent development for me. Next up, the ETF. Then finally the block size debate, which will rage on. I've never parked BTC in an alt to hedge against a crash, but since I'm buying so frequently now, I have to pay a little closer attention. 
Every day, I lean a little more forward in my seat.

First, if they suspect you're doing something illegal, federal law prohibits them from telling you what triggered them to close your account, so that's never coming. 
Second, I don't know about your gym, but you can use BTC to pay for Uber with the Gyft app. 
I have two direct deposit streams. One I send to Bitwage who converts it entirely into BTC for me. The other one I send to my regular bank who has no connection to my BTC dealings. None.

I also second this but with this change:
Windows/Linux/Tails OS: Electrum
If you want to run a wallet on a PC and are terrified about all the "I was hacked stories" that seem to come through in waves, then Tails might be for you. It's a compact version of Linux that can boot from a USB flash drive and is designed to hide as much as possible of your online activities. They recently added Electrum as a runnable app in their setup.
Electrum, like all of the apps listed, uses a list of words to tell the app which set of Bitcoin addresses to use for your transactions. Unlike the others, when you shut down Tails that was booted off the USB, the PC has no trace of anything you did left on it.
If you can memorize 12 words in a specific order, you can boot up, move some balances around (like put some spending money on your phone) and shut down without leaving a trace anywhere on your PC. It is a very secure way to store and protect your balances for very little cost, and you will likely not join the list of people posting "I was hacked :(".
Security is your responsibility. 
@_date: 2015-05-23 10:15:37
Nearly all of your feature requests are met by either device currently shipping by Ledger. Ledger is the company, not the product name.  They offer a $35 Nano and a $20 HW.1. Both do secure 2FA by mobile phone. Both store your private keys hidden away in a secure area on the USB compatible smart chip. Both are smaller than a house key and fit on a keychain, but the Nano with its metal cover appears better suited to take that kind of abuse.
Totally unrelated to Bitcoin, but you can also use your Ledger devices to securely authenticate yourself to websites that have added them as an authentication mechanism. 
For under $50 end users can get top notch security today, with new features still being added.

Don't just focus on these payment services, either. Since Bitcoin is regulated as property in the US, people could actually donate BTC to you and not be liable for capital gains taxes on donated balances. The BTC they donate has to be provably held for over a year in order to qualify for these benefits. 
Otherwise, if they just pay you or do it haphazardly, they could be slaughtering themselves taxwise while trying to do something nice for you.

I keep track of all my purchase prices and spend at or below the purchase price to avoid capital gains. Every purchase goes into a new HD wallet and every wallet is marked with its purchase price. I can prove every spend was at or below the purchase price. Any BTC that is so cheap I can never spend it just gets parked. I buy just about every week so I always have some fresh BTC near current prices to spend anyway.
@_date: 2014-10-01 21:54:34
Sort of. The tax nightmare is what keeps my balance at 0. Each time you buy or mine (in the old days), you must write down the date you acquired the BTC, how much BTC you acquired and how much it was worth in USD. Then, when you spend BTC or otherwise transfer it out of your possession, you must record again the date, the amount in BTC and the value in USD. At tax time, you must document how long you held all BTC that you spent and how much it increased or decreased in value in USD while you held it.
Any BTC you can prove you held longer than a year (i.e. in a separate address) will cost you less in taxes on any gains vs any BTC you held less than a year. You may also deduct the entire value of BTC you held longer than a year and donated to a qualifying charity (up to $3,000, I believe).
I said "sort of" at first because there are people out there who are still way down from their purchase price. Those people may never need to declare gains and pay taxes on those gains, but they are also leaving money on the table by not declaring their losses all in the name of convenience.
Similarly, those who mined 50 BTC two or three times a day several years ago are getting slammed, paying over 20% capital gains tax on every dollar they spend in BTC. Bought a car for $60,000 in "free" money you mined back in high school? Congratulations, you now owe another $14,000 on your tax bill because you spent BTC that was over a year old. That's not sales or use tax. That's capital gains tax since you spent investment funds. No problem because you can pay your tax bill with BTC, right? Well, you just generated ANOTHER $3,500 tax bill by paying your prior capital gains tax bill with BTC.
So yes, if the BTC you spent has gone up in value since the day you acquired it,  you must pay an extra tax for using it UNLESS you can cancel out the gains by spending BTC that is worth less than when you bought it. Oh, and before I forget, you only need to report and pay taxes on net increases of more than 50c. Under 50c increase doesn't count. So if you buy and spend immediately, chances are that the BTC won't have a chance to increase in value by 50c or more while you held it. Suppose you buy $200 in BTC using Mycelium Local Buy and then immediately turn that into a Target gift card via Gyft, chances are the value in USD will not increase by 50c while you held. That way you still get all the protection of placing an air gap between your bank account and the Target cash registers but you escape the reportable event.

How about hosting an informative website and faucet on an otherwise disconnected router? If I were staying on the 30th floor in Midtown Manhattan again, you could rest assured I'd stick an old DD-WRT router in the window and name the SSID  "Free Bitcoin". 
Anyone who connects and brings up a browser will go to a simple informative page that after having them page through a couple of screens of background information, shows a QR code with a copyable private key. They can copy it, disconnect from the Wi-Fi, install a mobile wallet and paste in the private key and sweep it.
Of course it would all have to work offline, so I would have to load 1000 bits into a hundred addresses and make sure the web site only displays each code once. It should also detect campers by MAC address. Maybe show some links to useful YouTube videos. 
You could probably do it entirely within an old WRT54G. Plug it in and stick it in the window. Get back to the hotel after work and check some statistics. See if you had any takers.

Yup. At Action Park was my first Shellac CD and got the most play from me. I just loved how instead of the lyrics, he wrote a description of each song on the liner notes. 
My personal favorite of his philosophical writings was of course the classic writeup about how the music industry screws musicians. He goes into excruciating detail about how the performers lose at every turn.
You would think his disdain for large, entrenched societal structures would lead him to embrace Bitcoin. It, like all Open Source software, flips the power structure on its head, returning the power that really belongs to the people back in the hands of the people. 
My very first Big Black song that I recorded off the radio was Burning Indian Wife from Atomizer. That didn't make it to Rich Man's Eight Track Tape, so I never had a good digital copy of it (which is ironic, considering the purpose of naming it RM8TT). So I wrote to him at Electrical some 20 years later, asking him for a digital copy. He replied almost immediately, "I'm sure it's out there somewhere. Just download it."
I found a copy, and faked the playlist of my copy of RM8TT out on the cloud to reinsert it in its rightful place in history, but, as I'm sure it was just some guy who recorded it at home off his vinyl copy, it just doesn't sound the same as the rest of the tracks from Atomizer. 
How can you not love the comparison of Cables, the studio version on Headache/Hammer Party and the live version on Atomizer/Rich Man's? I still get chills almost 30 years later. Such a great figure in the history of music.

Be careful when making broad statements like these. It's easy to refute them. Each location I've visited has heard of Bitcoin. They just had no idea they are selling Bitcoin via the LibertyX menu option. I'm obviously not saying they all (let alone most) know about Bitcoin, but to flat out say none do was already inaccurate based on my personal experience alone. Keep in mind many of these locations are in pretty rough neighborhoods. When I asked the proprietor if he'd heard of Bitcoin he immediately replied, "you mean like Silk Road?" More of them may have heard of it than you think.
That's why LibertyX pays you $5 to be the first customer at a given location. They want you to spread the word for them, and have a conversation with the shop owner if they're around.

Seriously, if anyone came here wanting to talk about the currency and prices, they would have been disappointed. This definitely has a "next phase" kind of feel to it. Blockchain apps, payment technology, and next generation exchanges. I saw one mining hw manufacturer upstairs. 
This is all about developers, projects, startups, entrepreneurs, VCs and angels all looking for each other. During the parties, you literally see, "I'm here, come pitch to me!" messages in the chat channel. Not that that's necessarily a bad thing, it's just definitely not what some may have expected. I expect it to be just like SXSW next year.

Sorry I didn't see this post at first, but I think I covered the questions.
No Bluetooth, AFAIK. It's just a smart chip. The Chrome app will send the transaction details over the Internet to your phone for verification and authorization. I'm using legacy addresses to temporarily hold balances that would trigger a reportable event to the IRS if I spent them. I just label them with an exchange rate that is low enough that I won't have to tell anyone that I bought and spent them.
The goal is to have 0 gains or minimal losses so I don't have to bother with accounting. If I keep them in [EDIT: my main hot wallet in] Mycelium, I can't guarantee that I maintained certain balances separate from others, thus mixing BTC together. I really don't want to get into figuring out how old all BTC is or at what price I bought each satoshi. Once the price comes back down to safe levels for a given wallet, I will sweep that temporary wallet back into my main hot wallet for spending. I use a bunch of legacy wallets to keep track of the safe exchange rates for each batch of BTC. $199 here, $277 there.
It's easy to tell which BTC is safe to spend just by comparing the wallet label to the current exchange rate. My goal is to buy and spend within a day or two, but sometimes I just can't make it happen. If the price moves too much while I'm holding it, I'll just move it into a temporary spot clearly labeled to tell me when I can pull it back out again. If it goes up too much I could owe the feds $600 on a $1,500 item and if it goes down too much, I could turn a $5 cup of coffee into $8. Better to just spend it at the same exchange rate I bought it. Don't have to tell anyone and I don't lose too much money on it. Anyone who tells you "they're all the same" doesn't understand the whole situation.

I didn't read the original question, so I don't know to what resolution the question was seeking. If someone wants to get a rough estimate as to the number of BTC that have been mined by a certain month or year, the swag I described above is perfectly fine. But if the poster wants to know exactly how many BTC have been mined and predict how many will be mined within the next few hours to a day, then of course you're correct and the math is next to impossible.
In IT consulting and solutions design they teach us to first collect requirements and then design a solution that meets those requirements. What level of granularity OP is seeking is definitely one of those requirements you want to nail down.

In the US, we have LibertyX. You buy PIN codes at thousands of retailers for varying amounts from $50 to $300 each and then you wait. The exchange rate floats until you redeem and tracks preev almost perfectly. You wait for the price you want, enter one or more of the PIN codes representing the amount of fiat you want to spend, and the BTC starts coming into your wallet as fast as a regular transaction always happens. You may redeem up to $1,000 a day. No limit on PINs, though, as it's cash only for now, so they can't track the first half of the sale: only the part that matters.
They currently price at Bitstsamp + 0%. I was waiting for sub $100 only to see just how "sub" it could go. If it goes below $50, I'll start buying PINs.

They have thousands of locations in 33 states. You may be able to get someone to come meet you for the exchange, but I bet I could get it done in a store faster than that. Plus my way will have a much better exchange rate.

LibertyX is like Local Bitcoins, except there are thousands of sellers standing by in 33 US states waiting for you to walk up and buy from them roughly between the hours of 10-7. Minimal KYC and a $2,500 weekly limit. No fees on the first $1,000. 1% after that. I really enjoy buying from them.

They've never claimed they will refund the $5 million that was in transit. Only the balances that were sitting in protected cold storage and those funds that were moved to and through the new deposit address. The $5 million represented a small slice of the total balance in their system.

I, too, am very sorry for your loss and his family's loss. If he had a place where he stored life insurance, mortgage, car or house titles or other very important paperwork, look for papers with seemingly uninformative information handwritten on them. If he used paper wallets, he may have written the first or last half dozen digits from the public key with the password next to it. He may have also written down a list with 12 or 24 words on it and laminated it. That list would likely unlock some funding.

A week after I bought my first $100 in BTC, I spent $30 on a Ledger Nano. You can also get their HW.1 which features the same top tier technology as their Nano for about $20. The bar is set very low in terms of moving on to the best in BTC key management. 
If you have an iPhone, Bread takes advantage of the secure data storage capability, but if you have a Note 5, you actually have a separate secure processor as well as secure storage, so your key generation happens outside of user space, not just your key storage.

They absolutely do. Any business that regularly exchanges fiat for BTC and doesn't collect at least basic information won't be doing this for much longer.
Name, address, cellphone and email. You can start buying up to $1,000 a day as fast as you can fill out the forms and click the links sent to your phone and email. In fact, LibertyX doesn't actually make the connection to you at the counter. There's nothing stopping you from buying a bunch of LibertyX PIN codes first and then finding friends or family to sign up and redeem one or more of the PIN codes and deposit the BTC directly into your wallet.
The only other way to avoid registering is to use person to person sales such as Localbitcoins or Mycelium's Local Trader.

The main point is to ensure that the PC managing your cold storage never touches the Internet. You can't just unplug the PC from the Internet when you start working with your cold storage and still consider that safe. You could disconnect from the Internet and reboot the computer from a CD or DVD image. 
It is doubtful that an infected computer hard drive could attack an OS that is running from a CD or DVD, especially if the two OSes are completely different (i.e. booting a Windows computer off a Linux DVD).

I'm not panicking over the drop. I'm panicking that I don't have a "get in" strategy. I see it as a second chance for those of us who sat on the sideline watching closely for 2014, but where do I get in? Do I get in at $100? $25? $10? $0.01? Hell, at $0.01, I'd probably get in for $5,000. A return to $300 turns that $5k into $150M. I have big hopes for Africa, Eastern Europe and SE Asia. In the meantime, a couple of very big drops on bad news will make it tasty.
@_date: 2015-05-12 21:33:17
I don't know if you've already read my answer about "are addresses like bank accounts?" but I realized I never answered your first question. Your wallet gets the history from other people running the full version of the client, just like you. That's why it is important to open port 8333 on your firewall and forward it to the machine where you're running Core. Clients broadcast a transaction into "the network" which in turn asks multiple nodes (like yours) to confirm that the attempted transaction is valid. Only full nodes can confirm that an attempted transaction is valid, while miners take valid transactions and permanently append them into the blockchain, ensuring they can never be altered, reversed or that a user cannot spend the same BTC more than once. Nodes do not get paid to verify that attempted transactions are legitimate, but miners do get paid to guarantee forever that BTC that was already spent cannot be spent again. The two work hand in hand to create "the Bitcoin network".
Before I go any further: don't get me wrong about being paid to mine. "End user" miners will typically spend about $500 on equipment and $400/month in electricity to earn about $40/month in BTC. It is completely not worth it. Again, you will lose a lot of money if you try to mine without spending a ton of money. That being said, there are businesses out there that will run thousands of miners. Their business strategy typically includes selling the BTC they earn from mining. They fill airplane hangars with equipment and are stationed near places with cheap electricity costs in order to squeeze as much profit as possible out of the mining equipment. 
Finally, as described elsewhere, there is another kind of wallet or node that does not need to download the entire transaction history. Mobile apps like Mycelium and Breadwallet rely upon servers hosted by the app developers to make life MUCH easier for end users. That convenience comes at the cost of potential security risks for the end user and also puts a demand on the network that is not returned by the user. Electrum on all PC platforms can be used in the same way as the mobile apps at first but the end user is also free to setup a server that provides the missing functionality and support that the network needs. It also supports some of the highest security available in terms of connecting the client to the server and protecting your balances overall. It is a very flexible tool that is easy to setup and use and you can get going right away immediately after install.
@_date: 2015-01-25 03:00:48
I have a bunch of different wallets in Mycelium that I've tagged with the purchase price and date so I know when I can spend that BTC without any capital gains or, if I'm eventually forced to, the reduced long term capital gains rate. I prefer to hold all my cheap BTC unless the price comes back down again.

I was listening to the Unchained podcast and a guest said yes, they have used them all up. Also, everyone keeps saying "on" March 11th. It's my understanding that that is the deadline. The decision can come down any time, and even if they don't make any announcements on the 11th, it will be accepted by default. 
Everyone keeps saying it's on, when I've heard it is BY.

In the US, LibertyX. Bitstamp + 0% and it takes 10 minutes to go from zero to $1,000/day buying limit. Here's the best part: you buy redemption coupons at thousands of retailers nationwide, and the deposits begin at the same speed as a regular transaction starting the moment you enter the redemption code on the website. BUT, the exchange rate floats until you redeem. 
This means you can buy a pile of $50 redemption codes, watch the exchange rate drop, and slowly redeem them instantaneously at price points of your choosing all the way down. 
When I see people everywhere complaining about waiting days for deposits or sending pictures of them holding their license, I wonder why anyone would do it that way. 10 minutes to get started and you get to choose when to execute every trade, almost to within half a minute. 
Edit: Inb4 "he said ONLINE". Yes, my suggestion requires visiting one of thousands of retailers nationwide.

I have the Nano. There is no Bluetooth connection to the Ledger AFAICT. It's just a smart chip trimmed down to fit on a piece of plastic the normal size of a USB jump drive. There may be a Bluetooth option linking the PC and the phone, but no, there's no Bluetooth stack or transmitter in the smart chip on the Nano unless I'm proven wrong. Once it is initialized on a clean PC you don't need to maintain a clean PC after that.
I am even unsafe with my temporary wallets. I generate them right on my phone at bitaddress.org using the bulk wallet feature. I just copy the private keys into Mycelium and leave them empty until I need a place to stash some cheap BTC until the price comes back down and its safe to spend. Then I store the keys in a PGP encrypted text file on my laptop just in case something funky happens with my phone.
It would be nice if Mycelium supported some way to back up legacy wallets. They just assume since you got the address from somewhere else that you must already have a backup of it. I'm also a bit concerned that all my tags on my accounts and transactions will be lost should I need to recover my seed on another phone.
i'll keep doing this so long as I know I'm spending BTC at the same or lesser price than when I bought so I don't have to tell anyone about the transactions. Buying and spending through an up market like '13 would have been much more of a reporting nightmare than spending through a down market like '14, especially if you don't use a web wallet that packages up your transaction history nice and neat.
I think '14 will have lulled many people into thinking they don't have to report when we've already seen a 25% jump in the last week alone. if you don't want to report your transactions, just make sure the price stayed flat or dropped between the time you bought and spent.

You send your paycheck to them instead of your regular bank. You choose how much of your paycheck you want to receive in BTC and how much in fiat. They send any portion you want in fiat to your regular bank. I get two direct deposit paychecks, so I just take the entire smaller one in BTC. I don't buy BTC using my regular bank, nor do I have BitWage send any fiat to my regular bank. No way am I tipping off my regular bank.

I'm trying to learn IBM Bluemix by developing an app that will alert whenever the price rises by 20% within a 24 hour period. At some point I will have a pile of unredeemed LibertyX PIN codes and I will need a way to find out it is time to strike since you can redeem within seconds.
Of course, alerting AFTER the rise is not the time. I still need to figure out what I want.

Definitely recommend the Nano too. No cable connecting the device to your computer. It fits on your keychain so you can have it on your person not locked away somewhere, and the development / support team is incredible.
I complained to the CEO once about them focusing on awards they were winning instead of working on the verify-by-phone feature (the main reason I bought it directly from him at TNABC '15) and within 4 hours he shot a video showing progress being made on the feature, posted it to YouTube and wrote to me to tell me to check out the video! I was shocked.
Meanwhile, when Trezor learned what other people can do with your GPL code, they changed the license. When the community freaked out on them, they changed it back. Being able to give out a dummy seed list under duress would be nice, though, I have to admit. That's definitely a check in the Trezor column.
I have memorized my 12 words for Electrum, but I haven't tried 25 for the Nano.

We've chatted elsewhere already but to start the conversation here, it happened on my first try. The store knew immediately what I was referring to but insisted they dropped the network a year before I came looking for it. Everything else nearby was in the city and a pain to get to from the suburbs. I notified LibertyX and they removed the location within minutes.
I've also had a T-Mobile store clerk say she can see other vendors available on the QPay page of her register, but her manager only allows her to process payments for T-Mobile. I notified immediately and they indicated they'll try to get the manager to reconsider his position. I just drove 10 minutes down the road to a generic "cellular solutions" kind of store and they were happy to work with me. LibertyX has not yet removed the T-Mobile store. I guess they're going to wait to see if they are able to convince the store manager.
I've had two successful buys out of four tries. Once I gave up for the day, once it worked on the first try and once I had to drive to a second location before I was successful.
@_date: 2015-01-18 21:46:31
My very first try had the same result. They said they left the network a year before I asked. Every place I've called since then was still on the network. One place I called yesterday said they can see other vendors on the QPay network, but "the boss won't let [me] click on anything except T-Mobile".

Wanting privacy doesn't mean wanting privacy because I'm doing illegal things. It just means I want some privacy. Imagine being able to create a new bank account for every single transaction whether it be for sending or receiving money. Now imagine restructuring all of your credit and debit card transactions to be push transactions instead of pull.
When I pay a restaurant bill, I put the amount I want to spend in a single use account and then transfer the entire amount to you. You can check the remaining balance of that account (which will be 0 forever) and you can never take another penny from it. No more fraudulently charging me after I leave. Yes, fraud is covered but it's not free. We all pay for that. 
Imagine being able to fly to another land, have a great vacation using only this universal currency and never needing to call back home to beg to have access to your funds restored because what you're doing is out of the ordinary.

No one really knows for sure, but here's my line of thinking. It's based on the analysis that says "if bitcoin is going to be useful to millions of people, then it is going to have to rise in value, especially as the increase in supply slows."
Therefore, I see a long period of decline while more and more people learn how to use it as a currency. Then, as stated above, when the number of people driving amounts of value being transferred greatly exceeds the supply available, the value will have to increase in order to support transferring that value.
1. Get a lot of people to use it, and
1. The value will rise to accommodate the amount of value people are trying to transfer
This will take 15-20 years, IMHO. We will need a LOT more people to start using it all the time in order to fill the space. In the meantime, buy it and spend it every day if you can. The entrepreneurs are already building the next generation of functionality on top of the blockchain. They have effectively left the currency behind, based on what I've seen this weekend in Miami.

I've also enjoyed that conversation each time I bought from LibertyX. I try to customize the conversation for each person. 
The first one was more of a business owner so I focused on the low (or no) transaction fees, the irreversibility of the transactions and the protection you get by using BitPay. The guy's eyes lit up when he realized that he sold Bitcoin at his own register that customers could immediately turn around and use to buy stuff in his own store and he could put an end to credit card fees.
The second one was a college age kid who had family in another country. He pays $3 to send up to $2,000 home. It was easy to compare fees, but it was not easy to discuss the remittance in the opposite direction of what would be doable today. So I reversed it, describing a family that saved up to send a kid to college in the US. I described how Bitcoin deposits at home could be used within seconds at a Target by way of the Gyft app.
Now that he's here and earning money, I couldn't easily describe what his family in Honduras would be able to do with it. I also showed him the Airbitz app so that he could easily see where to spend BTC domestically.

He's the only person who was there at the beginning and was already an expert in the wide variety of topics that Bitcoin touches and issues addressed. Check out his work on codifying contracts in computer code like a scripting language.

Since you mentioned "every paycheck", here's the super easy way. 
1. Buy a Ledger Nano S and set it up. Create a new BTC wallet on it called "Paycheck" or something like that. 
1. Sign up at Bitwage. When configuring your profile, get the xPubKey from your "Paycheck" wallet and copy and paste it into the appropriate field in your profile page. Choose the amount of BTC you want to buy and if it is not 100%, add your bank details indicating where you want them to deposit the cash left over after buying the specified amount of BTC. 
1. Change your Direct Deposit at work to send your paycheck to the bank account details provided to you by Bitwage. 
1. Install Mycelium on your phone and add a new account using the same xPubKey you gave to Bitwage. 
Your paychecks will now start arriving a day or two later, but now the balance of your "Paycheck" wallet on your Nano S will automatically climb and the amount deposited into your bank will be reduced by the amount of BTC you instructed Bitwage to buy. 
That's it. Just go back to your normal life. The rest will happen on its own. Bitwage makes buying BTC boring. Also, when you're ready to get into Ethereum, you will already have the best hardware wallet for storing that, too. 
Bitwage aims for 2% fees for every buy. They also charge $10/mo if you don't take your entire paycheck in BTC. I have two Direct Deposit streams at work, so I send my smaller one to Bitwage and receive the entire amount in BTC, thus avoiding their fee to split up my payment.
@_date: 2017-02-09 19:21:16


Yup. I travel over 30 weeks a year for work, and I get all my travel expenses reimbursed via a separate direct deposit transfer. I just send all of those reimbursements to BitWage and get all my expenses back in BTC a couple weeks later. I get to control how much BTC I want to buy each week by varying how much cash I spend on my trips. If I want to buy a lot of BTC, I spend a lot of cash during the week. If I don't feel like buying, I put all my expenses on my corporate card and keep my cash outlay low.
It's the best setup I've ever had.

With BitPay as a payment processor, they can keep anywhere from to 0-100% of Bitcoin receipts in BTC or fiat. Also, most small businesses use QuickBooks, which already has Bitcoin support built in or available.
They get to choose the exact level of accounting complications they are willing to withstand by adding Bitcoin as a payment option, and "None" is an acceptable answer.

BitPay is one of the primary methods in the US to enable a business to accept Bitcoin as a payment option for customers. They bring up the Bitpay app on a smartphone or tablet, enter the amount of the bill, optionally allow the customer to add a tip if it is a tip-oriented business and then show you a QR. You scan it with your wallet to pay and a big green checkmark appears on their screen within a couple seconds to indicate successful payment. Businesses like it because it is stupid easy to use and they can choose how much of their income they want to receive in Bitcoin or in their regular currency. I paid for dinner on Friday night at the big Bitcoin party in Miami Beach with Bitcoin. At least one of their servers has the Bitpay app installed on a phone he carries around with him. I told them I wanted to pay with Bitcoin and they called him right over.
Last weekend I tried to pay for dinner in Tampa, but when the guy showed up with the tablet, they gave him one of the worst $20 tablets I've ever seen. When I touched the screen to add a tip, the tablet processed a bunch of false touches causing the app to crash. When I hit the back arrow to clear the error, the app shut down, dumping out to a desktop. No one, not even the owner of the restaurant, knew the credentials to log back into the app and let me try again. That was just poor planning all the way around on their part.
Bitpay tends not to be very popular around here because some bitcoiners feel the businesses are exploiting us. They are using our zeal to drive up business but may not be supporting the whole concept, especially if they turn it into cash immediately. They appreciate us enough to take our money. It is very easy for businesses to start accepting payments via Bitpay and it doesn't necessarily have to add any complexity to their accounting system.
They did sponsor the Bitcoin Bowl college football game back on December 26th and ran some pretty good ads, so they are definitely doing some good stuff for the community.
EDIT: Watch Bitcoin Jesus buy a t-shirt at the conference using Bitcoin. The catch is he was attending remotely via a robotic presence. The vendor held the QR code generated by the Bitpay app up to the camera. He scanned it on his end and paid the bill. He wasn't even in the US. You'll see how quickly the iPad screen turns green to verify that the Bitcoin payment was successfully received.
Sorry for the utter and complete moron (I swear it's an actual medical condition) shooting it vertically. If you saw the people working the t-shirt stand, you'd understand.

Yes, on your side of the counter. On the merchant's side, it may be a different story. You'll see this come up a lot around here, but most merchants that offer Bitcoin as a payment option to customers use services that offer to transfer the payment to the merchant in any mix of Bitcoin or fiat.
So long as merchants price their goods in fiat, the Bitcoin price will fluctuate all day. Merchants do not have the incentive to price in Bitcoin prices so long as this kind of fluctuation remains.

Fair enough and a good read. I usually try not to use extreme limit words like always, never, none, nothing, all and everyone because words like that are often easy to refute. You can also easily escalate the discussion at hand to the point that you must also trust the source code, the compilers, the transistors and the silicon powder that went into making the chips. There is a ton of trust that is required long before you get to guaranteeing that your machine has not been physically modified. At some point the chances that you are going to be singled out for an attack of that sophistication should become acceptably low.
That's also why I like my Nano. Fits right on my keychain and it is always on my person. No one is going to abscond with it -- and return it -- without my knowing. Thank you for the reminder to avoid terms that can easily be proven incorrect. That one got by me.

Thanks for the great follow up and the coinage, much appreciated! There's some really great stuff you can do with a small box pulled out of trash and some ingenuity.
"Just add foot traffic."
My daydream site needs a way for the admin to upload freshly loaded private keys should the first batch ever get depleted. Then find a good spot in Penn Station New York with an outlet where no one would look. About 10,000 people must pass through the main waiting area every day. You can add the public keys as Watch Only addresses in a separate wallet app on your phone and occasionally look to see if the balances are going down. Just flick through the list and look for balances that have dropped to 0. That's the beauty of the solution. You don't need Internet connectivity on your end of the faucet -- you only need to keep track of which private keys you've displayed so you don't show them again. Keep an eye on those addresses and if they're not swept within a month after they've been displayed, republish those addresses.
I'd love to just pull up into the waiting area, switch my phone wifi over to the faucet, download the addresses that have been displayed and upload some freshly loaded addresses if they're needed. Add the "used" addresses to Mycelium and wait for the balances to gradually disappear from each watched address. Sounds fun!

Great answer. It's clear you're on top of it. Now that you ask, I have to think about it. Would you consider the triggering condition be that the app is in use vs funds are at risk? The HD wallet was indeed empty, but she did have a nonzero balance in a watch only address. And you do have feedback from a user who was a little concerned about not seeing the warning (me!).
All I know is I saw a balance and warning in my HD wallet and a balance but no warning in her watch only address. Instead of a reminder that no funds were at risk, I only had the lack of a warning that funds were at risk. Felt inconsistent even though the consistency was not warranted.

With LibertyX, you have to submit your name, address, email and cellphone. You then click links sent to your email and cellphone. No bank accounts, no photo ID. Register in minutes, drive to a nearby store - there are thousands across the US - plunk down cash and walk away with a receipt. Enter a PIN code on the receipt into the web site and the deposit starts right away. 
You don't even have to show ID at the store. It's like having a couple thousand LocalBitcoin sellers waiting around across the country from 10-7. No scheduled meetings needed. And it's priced at Bitstamp + 0, so it's great pricing, too. If you're the first customer at a particular store, tell them about your experience and get a $5 bonus. So if you buy $50 and get the $5 extra, that's Bitstamp _minus_ 10%! Can't beat that with a stick.

I don't have any skin in the game so I'm not worried. They also indicated that only the hot wallet was compromised and that they can cover all balances that were not in motion and those being sent to the new deposit address. 
That's a pretty specific statement to release if they didn't have technical proof behind it. 
I chalk it up to youth and inexperience trying to play in the big boys' sandbox. Luckily they've at least indicated that only a small portion of their balances were lost. Welcome to the big leagues.

I like it! I don't spend any unless the current value is at or barely below purchase price so that I have no tax paperwork or significant losses.

He already said he wasn't running it, but if he were and that were the attack vector, the attacker would have responded to and then deleted the 2FA email using the victim's own computer. 
The victim has since said all logins to his Gmail were from his own devices. That alone does not rule out a Team Viewer attack. 
So, yes, a Team Viewer attack (if the victim were actually running it) would pass the 2FA setup that was in place, both on BCI and Gmail. Think about it. 
Edit: Maybe you assumed the BCI 2FA was going to SMS, not Gmail.

This just means they didn't fully understand the implications of Open Source, the difference in the marketplace between now and 20 years ago or just how dedicated they were (or were not) to their principles.
They underestimated the Chinese and didn't appreciate how quickly they could get a clone out the door. 
I'm more surprised by the jump to supporting the Chinese of all people as opposed to making the jump to Ledger. Same smart chip as bank cards, 2FA by phone due any day now.

Mycelium and Ledger. I'm waiting for the Ledger firmware update that moves the 2FA to my cellphone before I start using it.
I don't want to have any reportable events, so I maintain separate wallets named for their safe spending levels. By spending right at or just below the price where I bought it, I won't make enough gains to report anything (nor will I lose too much to bother reporting that, either).
With LIFO accounting, the big investments sink to the bottom while little ones come and go off the top, but it doesn't take much movement at these prices to trigger a reportable event. I need to spend very little of a $100 buy when the rate moved from $200 (last weekend) to $245 (right now) before it becomes reportable gains. I'd rather just tuck it away in a "Spend @ $200" wallet and use a different wallet to buy and spend some at current prices.
I'm definitely in the camp of "use it like currency, but don't be stupid and try to ignore the feds". Just know the rules and use it properly.

You bet. Check out the website so you'll have an idea of what to say to ensure a smooth transaction. Call ahead to make sure the shop is still on the QPay network and will allow you to make a payment through QPay. Three out of four shops I've visited were still on the QPay network, but one store manager only allowed his employees to process payments for T-Mobile. Also, sometimes the actual store name on the building doesn't match the name shown on the website. You're generally looking for generic cellular shops and check cashing places.
No matter what the outcome, LibertyX wants to hear all about your experience, even if it's just to tell them the location is no longer valid or needs to be renamed. You need to email support anyway in order to claim the Trailblazer bonus. I just forward my confirmation receipt to them with a short narrative on how the transaction went. Great bunch of people over there. They've been very responsive to me every time.

The second try was in Tampa and the third and fourth tries were in Miami since I was there for NABC. Not to mention I enjoy getting the $5 Trailblazer bonuses. If you buy $50 and get the bonus, that's like getting Bitstamp *minus* 10% pricing! You definitely can't do that on LBC or Mycelium Local.
That being said, I wish Airbitz would list LibertyX locations on their map since they show BTMs. I also wish BitPay would use the LibertyX map as a starting point as to where to focus on getting businesses to start accepting Bitcoin. i love the looks I get when the little retailers realize they now sell Bitcoin, and I think it would be great to see shops in their vicinity start accepting Bitcoin. The LibertyX shops are almost always in little shopping centers and I'd love to see BitPay target every store collocated with a LibertyX location.

I've been wondering about this. I used to have just a couple of HD wallets and bunch of legacy addresses. Now I've migrated each legacy wallet to its own HD wallet, and I often wonder if they will all come back with a restore. It doesn't make sense that they would -- that's why Airbitz makes such a big deal of your entire configuration being backed up. If they really won't come back, I'm going to have to take a closer look at Coinkite+Ledger.
Update: I've since learned that my other wallets will come back (unnamed) by repeatedly adding new HD wallets after restoring the primary. 
@_date: 2015-01-18 04:07:52
Sure, NP. It is done at any of thousands of retail stores across the US. In an interesting twist, many lower income areas (with people who will eventually benefit the most from a redo of the remittance market) have stores that offer services aimed at low income people. Generally these are check cashing places or places that let you pay your utility bill or prepaid cellphone bill in cash. 
Register at LibertyX.com by supplying your name, address, email and cellphone. You'll click verification links sent to your email and cellphone. Registration is completed within seconds to a couple minutes. 
Next, visit LibertyX.com/stores and look for locations closest to you. Call ahead and make sure they are familiar with letting customers "pay bills" via the QPay Network. That's the network that LibertyX has joined. If they are, head on over and ask them if you can make a payment via QPay. They will ask you who you are paying. Tell them LibertyX. They may notify you that all payments are cash only for this vendor. They may also look surprised when they only see payment amounts of $50, $100 or $300. Tell them how much you want to buy. They will take your cash and print out a short receipt.
Go into your Bitcoin wallet app and copy your Bitcoin receive address to the clipboard. Look near the top of the LibertyX receipt for a PIN code. Visit the Redeem a Code section of the LibertyX web site -- it's already mobile optimized so you can do this immediately if you want. Enter the PIN code from the receipt and paste in your receive address. The transfer is as quick as any phone to phone transfer you've done before. There's no manual review or intervention. Once you submit a good PIN code, they already know that they have your fiat in hand, so why wait?
Note that the exchange rate (Bitstamp + 0%) floats between the time you buy the PIN code and redeem it. This is great during a price crash because you can buy several codes at once and gradually redeem one or more of them at points all along the way down. No more waiting days to find out what rate you got or to learn that they canceled your order. No more big markups or scheduling meetups. 
Oh, and they also pay you an extra $5 if you are the first customer at a given location, and the bonus availability is easily identifiable at the website. So if you buy $50 and get the bonus, that makes their price Bitstamp _minus_ 10%! I've nabbed three bonuses so far. The counter staff have been so cool about learning about it. No one seems to know that they sell Bitcoin before the Trailblazer tells them. 
Instant transfers. Best rates. Real wallets, not theirs. I love 'em.
I'd say the only other model that comes close is the bank deposit option of LocalBitcoins. They, too, have thousands of locations nationwide open during normal business hours, and your only personal interaction is with a professional, courteous retail worker. You'll just get better rates with LibertyX and I have zero concern about my cash being confiscated due to an ongoing investigation of the account holder. I also doubt the bank deposit exchanges have an automated system that will start transferring BTC to you before you can even leave the counter, but I could be wrong.

Also, I had one rejection today when the girl working at T-Mobile insisted that even though she can see other vendors on the QPay screen, her boss says she's only allowed to click on T-Mobile. I asked her to have her boss call me so I could come visit and talk, but he never did. Oh well. The second place ten minutes away happily participated.

If you use FIFO and never just hold for one straight year, your holdings never get to age over one year. That means you get taxed at nearly double the capital gains rate than you would if you had separate long term holdings. 
Your strategy is fine in a down year or for spending small amounts that didn't have a big gain, but it breaks down when the balances are high in a big up year. At least with LIFO you have a chance to let big investments "sink to the bottom" while little amounts come and go up by the surface with little change while you held.
'14 was a down year, so not a lot of people are thinking about how to minimize their tax bill because they don't have one.

Nah, some of us have been dealing with Open Source since before half the Reddit community was born ('93, myself). I didn't necessarily point a pitchfork - well, maybe a little - but it did bring PTSD flashbacks from the front lines of the war back in the late 90s. We went through hell to get to this point and to see someone well respected pull us in under that premise and then just flip like that was more than a little jarring. I forgot what it felt like to be around someone new to OSS playing host to an actual community. That was a violation of trust and abuse of our dedication the likes of which I haven't seen in many years.
You may be familiar with DD-WRT and alternative firmware for routers but you may not have been around when manufacturers were found to be illegally sneaking Open Source code into their products. They either didn't realize it was wrong or thought they could get away with hiding it deep in their products where no one would ever find out. Well, they did, and that's how DD-WRT and similar alternatives were born. That's also part of what led to Microsoft trying to ban the development of Open Source software using their compilers -- they literally claimed that developing OSS with their compilers may retroactively cause some of their proprietary software to be changed to an Open Source license. Therefore it was banned.
tl;dr Don't mess around with the Open Source community, no matter how small or seemingly inconsequential the product.

To throttle the rate at which inflation through block reward will be replaced by mining fees. Shorten it up too much, and you risk cutting off the inflation before there's enough volume to warrant increasing the transaction fees. Extend it too long and you run the risk of providing too many coins, lowering the overall value of all of the issued coins.
He needed to strike a balance between inflation and volume. Every four years, there should be enough new transaction volume that the fees will replace the new coin creation.

As an alternative to loading different addresses in the same HD wallet, you can always generate a new HD wallet from the same base key (word list) and send a portion of the overall initial balance to the starter address in each HD wallet. 
Each HD wallet will then have its own sequence of addresses that will be used as you spend down that portion of the original balance. 
Mycelium makes it very easy to create a new sequence of addresses whenever you want to start a new chain, and all chains are restored should you lose or destroy your phone and need to restore on a new device.
They also make it easy to generate one off, single use addresses but those are unrelated to your word list and are NOT automatically restored should you need to restore. You would need to back them up separately.

1. Yes
2. Paper backup consists of writing down 24 words in a particular order. If your Trezor is lost, stolen or destroyed you can enter those words into another one or free software if you don't want to buy another one. 
3. You can't. That's one of the key differences between them and Ledger devices. Ledger devices check themselves for evidence of tampering each time you use them. 
4. Receive yes, send no. You need to use the device to authorize send requests. That's the entire point of this industry segment. 
5. No idea, but I doubt it. 
6. I highly recommend Ledger products. They make the Nano and the HW.1 as well as other products currently in development. The Nano and HW.1 are identical in features and technical specs and only differ in packaging. They both use a secure connection to your phone to enable visual confirmation of attempted transactions. 
They both run everything in the same style smart chip you see on credit and debit cards. The Nano has a nice metal cover and a ring for your keychain and is about the size of a house key. The HW.1 is barely larger than the smart chip itself. It is tiny. You can carry either Ledger device on your person at all times. You can't carry a Trezor on your keychain without looking ridiculous. 
The Nano (with the upscale packaging) costs $35 while the plain Jane but still the same technology HW.1 costs $20. They use security technology trusted by banks for decades. 
I'm a 20+ year Linux guy, but in this case, I'm with the proprietary guys. A lot of people are saying "a Ledger" without realizing that's the company name. Their currently shipping products are the Nano and HW.1.

Depending on the frequency, amounts and their geographical location, here's an idea. In the US, we have LibertyX. They sell BTC in the form of PIN codes you can buy at thousands of retailers across the country. The person buying BTC puts down cash on the counter, and is given a receipt. The receipt contains a PIN number. The person paying you would just buy some PINs (they come in $50-$300 amounts) and text you the PIN codes. You log into your LibertyX account, supply the PIN code and the wallet receiving address where to deposit the BTC and the transfer starts immediately. If they're near a LibertyX location, would it be too much to ask them to go in and buy some PINs with cash?
They don't need to install any apps or sign up for anything, anywhere. Walk into a store, plunk down cash, text you the PINs, done. Absolutely no KYC/AML anywhere on their part. If it's close and convenient to them, I think that's a great way to do it.

Welcome back. The landscape really has changed since the $1,000 days. A handful of us have been talking about LibertyX for a little while in here. If they're convenient to you, they are a godsend. With all of the problems that you hear about in here buying from other sources, it's always refreshing to know the LibertyX experience. 
* No waiting 3-5 days for your deposit to be converted into a purchase; I usually initiate the transfer from my phone while I'm still standing at the counter.
* No mailing a picture of you holding your photo ID.
* All BTC from the very first transfer goes into a real wallet that you control, not one that holds IOUs.
* No sudden account closures for an unspecified reason, leaving you to guess if someone you sent BTC later used that BTC on a Dark Net Market.
* No fees for the first $1,000, 1% after that. 
* No waiting a few hours for someone to process a cash deposit you made to their account, hoping that their bank doesn't shut them down one day for dealing in Bitcoin
Obviously, no one goes online to say everything is perfect so that list above is just a culmination of complaints we've heard over time from a series of exchanges and buying methods. If you name any exchange you'll get 20 people say they've never had a problem. Still, for small time buying, and if one is nearby, it's hard to beat LibertyX. 
I love the look of shock I get when I explain to the proprietor that I just bought Bitcoin off them. Invariably they never know about it. LibertyX has said to me before that they plan to ship "Bitcoin sold here" signs to the stores, but I haven't seen any myself, nor have I seen evidence in here that they are starting to show up. 
@_date: 2014-12-04 16:51:28
Been a while since I've compared the two, but back then Mycelium was the only one that lets you use QR codes for both halves of a spend transaction. Say you carry paper wallets in your leather wallet. They are BIP38 encrypted for safety. You carry very little or none at all in your phone wallet. Whenever you want to spend, you grab your phone, grab a paper wallet, start the spend transaction, select your destination from your address book or scan the QR and then scan the QR of your paper wallet to use as the source of the funds. The phone never keeps your spend QR longer than the milliseconds it takes to construct the transaction before transmitting it.
Much safer than the original strategy of keeping most of your BTC on paper and some in the phone. Now you can spend BTC just like you spend paper cash.

I think the OP's reluctance to post the tx id reveals an interesting aspect of the Bitcoin world. Do people not fully grasp that the whole idea is to have a public Blockchain? Yes, it serves as the underpinnings of a new global "currency", but it is also key to the openness of the system.
OP was concerned about what would be revealed by posting the tx id.  Meanwhile, all public aspects of every transaction are open to the public at all times. Do we need to better describe the strength of the public key cryptography behind the system? Just how wide is the gap in understanding?
The level of paranoia is appropriate, but needs to be applied to protecting your private key. All public data is exactly that -- public.

We have tiers of balances. There's long term storage and "walking around money". My long term storage is on my Ledger Nano, but I exported the public keys for my HD wallets to Mycelium on my phone. So if I hit up a LibertyX for some pocket money, and then it becomes too valuable, I just transfer some or all the balance from an HD wallet contained entirely within my phone to a different HD wallet since I can only check the balance or make deposits.
If you're thinking, "Fine, I'll make you take me to your house and drain your Ledger" then a) you're adding kidnapping to your list of charges and b) you don't know about my memorized seed in Electrum on TAILS.

It is not worth the effort to get at any BTC that is not immediately spendable from my phone.

Sorry, sometimes I forget when I'm on r/bitcoin vs Decouple the market cap from the per-coin value. It's that simple. Each coin has a different set of capabilities and features. The hope is that everyone will agree on the features and capabilities that they want the surviving BTC to have, but there will be some people who don't want to see the change implemented.
If the group who likes things the way they were is large enough and capable enough to keep the original BTC up and running, then the original small block BTC will stick around and it will continue to have value. That value will be completely unrelated to how much cash was invested up until now. It will be an altcoin that has its own features and capabilities and thus value per coin and fully independent market cap.
No funds will need to move from one coin to the other in order to maintain balance. Each coin will have a value per coin independent of the value assigned to the other coin. There is no requirement for something to be debited and something else to be credited when creating the new coin.
The entire ledger will be duplicated and then the two resulting ledgers will no longer track each other after the split. Perhaps I should have opened with that.
There is no equivalent in USD. Say Wells Fargo ATMs were found to be susceptible to hacking via bluetooth. The only way to fix that is by duplicating the entire Wells Fargo corporation including all the accounts and balances, but in the new version, the ATMs are running a new version of software not susceptible to hacking. Everyone who had an account at Wells Fargo now has the same account numbers and same balances in both versions of Wells Fargo. But the stock price of the version with the hackable ATMs has taken a hit and that version of WF needs to deduct money from our accounts in order to recoup the losses incurred through theft via the still-hackable ATMs.

Thanks, it's a no brainer on Android, AFAIC. Nothing else comes close. The only feature I liked on BC.I was push notifications for all transactions, even watch addresses. With yours, I have to try to remember what the balance was and check the transactions tab to verify that something came through.
I even walked my wife through backing up her seed before sending her some of the BTC I had just bought while we were still in the parking lot.
Oh, and while I have you, I liked how I had a big red warning on my phone when I hadn't yet successfully backed up my HD wallet. On my wife's phone, though, the app came up on her paper wallet watch only address, but when I switched to her HD wallet (which also hadn't been backed up yet), no warning appeared.
It would have been nice to get that big red warning reappear when switching from a paper wallet watch only to an HD without a backup.

Not that I'm supporting the position, but I'd just create a new HD wallet on Mycelium or my Nano and move it there just to keep the coins active. It's not as big a deal as it sounds.
I move "walking around money" from Mycelium on my phone to my Nano all the time. I have recreated every HD wallet on my phone with the same name on my Nano. Then I exported the xpubkeys for the Nano version of each wallet to Mycelium. Whenever my spendable balance gets too high on my phone, I just slide some of it over to the wallet on my Nano with the same name. Takes a few seconds on my phone and I don't need to plug in my Nano.
I'm not selling or transferring it to another party, so it's not a taxable event no matter how much they have increased in value. Also, since I name every wallet with the date and cost basis for that specific purchase (and don't blend BTC from separate purchases), I don't lose track of the cost basis for those funds.

Excellent choice. Now as long as you ensure that you never lose your 12 or 24 words, you won't lose your balances no matter what. Even if you get phone jacked on a subway, you can get a new phone, install the app, enter your word list, and regain control of your balances.
However, if your phone does get stolen or is rendered unusable and you have to reinstall on another device, you may also want to:
* install an additional wallet on the new phone, like Jaxx,
* transfer the balances stored on your old word list to Jaxx,
* generate a new word list in Bread, and
* transfer the balances from Jaxx back into Bread, now running under the new word list
This way, even if the thief somehow gains access to your stolen copy of Bread, there won't be any balance left in there for them to spend.

I have to live with the fact that I was actually in the "sub" (newsgroup) where it was born for years but left a couple years before it was developed. I have a Slashdot ID around 50,000 but left that, too, a couple years before Bitcoin was born to do enterprise IT. I had to learn about Bitcoin when my 68 year old mother-in-law read about it in the New Yorker and asked me for some. 
I am in aggressive buy mode and my goal now is to retire at a normal age but live off BTC in retirement. I am still investing in traditional ways, but in 17 years I don't expect to need to touch that money.

1. Bitwage charges $10/mo if you want to split your payment across BTC and fiat. I have multiple Direct Deposit feeds, so I just send the lesser one to Bitwage and get it all in BTC. I created a new HD wallet on my Nano just for Bitwage payments and gave them the xPubKey for that specific wallet. I also imported that same key into Mycelium so I can monitor the payments and also tag each payment with the amount and cost basis for recordkeeping.
They were a little annoying during the setup, but it has been flawless since getting approved.

There was an obvious winner in the case of Ethereum. You will have coins on both chains after the HF is the point that was being pushed here. If the split is closer to parity and you decide to cash in your coins on the chain that ultimately wins, yes, you will be in a world of hurt. 
If a portion of the community decides that the losing chain will live on, just make sure you have a wallet that will support it and be ready to sell if it looks like the losing team realizes how difficult it is to maintain a chain that was already deemed undesirable by the supporters of the "winning" chain. 
The "losing" team would need to stand up a team of competent developers and maintainers to keep this undesirable chain alive. (Edit to add: Of course, in BTCland, there have been separate teams of maintainers for quite some time already, so the effort to support the "losing" chain might not be as radical as it was in the case of Ethereum.)

The "balances" you see in Coinbase are just IOUs that they would probably honor if you request a withdrawal. Anytime you pull up a deposit address in the app, that address is only used as a place to look for ~~deposits~~
 (Edit: one deposit) that will be credited to your IOU balance. If you try to deposit twice to the same deposit address, the additional BTC won't even likely be credited to your account because they may have reassigned the address to the next person who wants to deposit BTC. Same goes for withdrawals. Don't EVER send BTC to an address that sent you BTC as part of a Coinbase withdrawal. They are pooled addresses and they have absolutely no way of knowing that an inbound transaction is supposed to increase your IOU balance. There is no permanent link whatsoever between your IOU balance, an address shown to you for depositing more BTC and an address that sent you BTC to fulfill a withdrawal request.
When it comes time to fork, those of us who manage our keys will have the same keys (and the same number of BTC) on both versions of Bitcoin. They won't both be worth the same in USD, GBP or whatever you use, but our balances measured in BTC will be the same. You, on the other hand, will still have your IOUs on whichever chain Coinbase chooses to follow. Coinbase is not likely to magically offer to double everyone's IOU balances. They are more likely to tell you which version of Bitcoin they are going to support, align your IOU balance with the indicated version of Bitcoin and then sell off the free Bitcoin that they and they alone will be privy to once Bitcoin splits into two different versions.
That's why you will constantly hear in here, "If you don't own your keys, you don't own your Bitcoin.  You have IOUs." If you're still holding IOUs at the fork, don't be surprised if you still have the same exact number of IOUs after the fork. You don't have any keys with which you may stake any claim in the fork they choose not to follow. No keys, no duplication of chains, end of story.

Uncle Sam always wants his slice. No matter what.
Now suppose you live in Iceland and get cheap electricity from geothermal and free cooling from mother nature. Say people send you $4,000 and an address for deposits. You buy and setup an S9 for them and configure it to deposit mining income in the address they gave you. They would have to declare it as income in the US. They may be able to slim it down if they establish a business on their end.
@_date: 2017-02-17 14:42:12


I do it for recordkeeping. In the US, you're required to keep track of how much your BTC was worth when you bought or acquired it and how it was worth when you sold or spent it. I just put every BTC purchase in a new HD wallet and name the wallet with the dollar amount, exchange rate and date. That way, when I go to spend, I pick a wallet that originally cost about the same or slightly higher than the current BTC prices. I make sure I never have reportable gains on my spends.
That also helps in forensic accounting in that every BTC purchase has its own trail of addresses as I burn through the balance. No entanglement.

8) Guarantee that a digital object existed in a specific form at a specific moment in time. Proof of Existence allows you to post a cryptographic hash of a file to the blockchain, thus guaranteeing forever that the file existed in that form at that moment.
I originally heard this as a suggestion for protecting yourself if someone decides to publish a book similar to one you're developing after seeing a draft. You could permanently record the existence of the document in a specific form and then permanently record an agreement that you shared a copy after that point in time.
Within the past day or two, I read about the suggestion to post public meeting minutes to prevent the rewriting of history at a later date. Excellent idea. It's great for anything that you want to guarantee existed in a particular form at an exact moment in time.

I've long felt they should attack the word lists. That way, you're only looking for a key that has ever held a balance. Once you find a key that now or previously held a balance, you'll know to traverse the chain and keep generating new chains off that word list until you find the end of each chain.
This approach makes it easy to "clear" millions of addresses in just a single search.

You won't lose any BTC stored on bread through the HF. You just won't be able to see or spend any on the chain they ignore until you enter your word list on an app that works with both chains.
They're not going to steal any BTC on the chain they're choosing to hide from you. They're not an exchange. They're just not going to make it easy to see your balance on or spend from the ignored chain. Someone else will need to develop that app or feature in their wallet.

Easy to do, but you can see it rankles some people. I don't necessarily want to see balances removed, but keeping it active is not that difficult as I described above. However, consider this. My sister just adopted a baby. I could put 1 BTC on paper now for his college fund. With your suggestion, it would be empty when he goes to spend it unless she remembers to move it somewhere between his 9th and 10th birthdays. Actually, that might be a cool 10th birthday surprise. Come back and show him what I gave him for his 1st birthday.
I'd rather see quantum computing go after the balance left over in a single-use address that was used in a partial spend or signature. Last year, I found an address where someone moved 1 BTC in and out within seconds to test the process and then moved $42 million in an hour later. That address should be up for grabs in two or three decades. That's the next space race. The "address space race".

Sure thing, no problem. I'd bet you can set a fixed dollar amount for buying BTC vs a percentage of your check. They've been around for a while and are quite responsive. You can't be the first person who would prefer to buy a fixed amount each period in dollars! As far as not wanting to reroute your paycheck, there's nothing that can be said to that. I was a bit nervous rerouting one of my payment streams, but it has been flawless the entire time.
As far as delaying it by a day or two? I keep a 2-year cash cushion, so getting my BTC a day or two after the payment is sent to them isn't a factor for me. Are you buying BTC while living paycheck to paycheck by any chance? I'd be more annoyed at paying $10/mo to split up my payments than a 2-day delay.

Go to poloniex.com/exchange and click on USDT in the top right corner. Look at the price charts for Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC). It is entirely possible and has already happened with another crypto. They will not retain the same value for sure, but there was real money left on the table if you didn't go out and claim it. The pressure wasn't that you were necessarily going to lose control of the keys, but that you had a short window to sell your coins on the chain that wasn't expected to survive.
One chain will lose the battle but no one can force it to go away completely if even a few people want to maintain a (worthless) chain.

I'll give it a shot.
What you think are balances in an address is actually your wallet software totaling up the series of transactions that have transferred BTC in or out of the address. So you may think you have a single collection of BTC, but the network knows you may actually have 7 transactions, 5 of which deposited BTC into that address and 2 that removed some. Those 5 deposit transactions are not lost in the accounting. They are "unspent transaction outputs" or utxos that are contributing to the overall balance shown.
When you spend with an HD wallet, all of the utxos are (typically) transferred out, with the amount you specified going to the address you specified and the remainder going to another, new address that your wallet software controls. Your wallet will always show a balance, but it is your utxos that move from address to address over the course of your transactions that actually contribute to what is displayed as your balance.

I slept through your little back and forth here. My suggestion has nothing to do with exchanges losing keys. It is referring to exchanges swiping any value attached to the losing chain. You suggest below that it is impossible, yet that's precisely what happened with the Ethereum fork.
Whoever holds the keys can sell their balance on the losing chain if the losing chain ultimately survives and when your funds are sitting in an exchange where you don't control the keys, then you don't have a say in what happens should the losing side live on as an alt. 
No, I don't think exchanges are going to lose keys as you suggested. I think they're going to sell off the losing chain's balances. I had my keys in Ethereum, so my funds were safe when it happened. Many others didn't.

@_date: 2017-03-14 02:01:50
Thank you for the kind words, I appreciate it. I'm about to hit the hay, but I can tell you that what would happen to coin on your exchange depends on the exchange. When Ethereum split, many people were completely pissed off that any exchanges even acknowledged the existence of the old version of the coin that was supposed to go away after the fork. The whole premise of what we're doing here is based on not creating money out of thin air and that's exactly what they did by recognizing that the old coin survived the split.
Then, on the flip side, there were exchanges who swiped the value attached to the legacy coin. You can imagine how much that pissed off their customers, but that's what we mean when we say if you don't have the keys, you don't have the coin. People don't have BTC in classic Coinbase accounts. They have IOUs that Coinbase would probably honor if faced with a request to withdraw BTC from against that IOU. If the feds contact Coinbase about a particular account, it would take a split second to shut off withdrawal requests against an IOU.
I'll ask you to do a little more reading of the sidebar or head over to for more basic information if you can't wait for me to reply tomorrow. In short, you have end users who are initiating transactions. Full nodes are systems that know exactly how much BTC is currently available in every address. Full nodes receive transactions that have been initiated by end users and validate that the address(es) that are being asked to transfer balances outbound actually have enough to cover the amount being requested. Finally, miners will take transactions that have been validated by nodes and make those transactions part of the permanent record. Transactions that are finalized are grouped into blocks and each block links to the block of transactions that was published immediately before. That creates a chain of blocks, aka the blockchain. It is the sequence of every transaction that has ever moved BTC from one or more address into one or more other address.
Operators of full nodes are not directly paid for their service. Miners are paid in BTC that is a combination of a "tip" that is attached to each transaction and new BTC that is created and inserted into the system. The size of the average tip required to get a transaction finalized has been climbing to what some say are ridiculous levels.
The software that miners are running is solving complex math problems. As more people run mining software in hopes of getting paid, the math problems automatically become more difficult to solve. Greed can play into the decision of which transactions shall be made part of the permanent record, largely tied to the amount of the tip attached to it.
If you can, locate the Unchained podcast published by Forbes. There was an episode last year with Andreas Antonopoulos as the guest. Great episode. He always does a great job at explaining it.

Few things to remember.
First, the 11th is Saturday. Some people are interpreting the rule that they will wait til Mondays to process new applications received on Saturdays to also mean that they will wait until Monday to publish a ruling on applications already in process.
Second, no ruling means automatic acceptance. If they don't publish by EOD Friday, some people are going to cheer thinking that they wouldn't issue a ruling on Saturday, so Friday was the last day to say anything if they are going to say anything at all. Others would prefer to wait until Saturday night to celebrate, thinking the SEC might put in Saturday hours for this ruling. Others will swear it is coming by EOD Monday. So if they stay radio silent all weekend, I think we're going to see waves of people celebrating at different times, possibly only to have everyone be let down on Monday afternoon.
With those points in mind, I don't think we will have a clear direction and may see wild price swings all weekend if rumors are allowed to fill the gaps. And if it turns out to be an accept by default, we may not have consensus until Tuesday(!), when all the theories of when the ruling may be published have come and gone.
I also think there's a good chance it will be denied before EOD Friday, causing the price to tank but recover very quickly -- as in 20 minutes or less.
I'm flying all day today. I have Bitcoin Paranoid installed on my phone and will see big market moves almost immediately. I may change my interval from 1 hour to 15 minutes for the next couple of days, though ;)

I was thinking that it multiplies the scam factor, but you're right, there's that, too.
I could be mistaken and some people were able to specify where to deposit BTC that was purchased, I don't know I wasn't there.
But on the surface, if the coins are still where they first landed, either this is a scam or he doesn't know he lost it all years ago and thinks he still has it because they're still showing. If he was able to withdraw before the collapse, then they still wouldn't be in their original address.

If you do it, don't pile everyone's coins into the main account. You can create multiple "accounts" (HD wallets) on your Nano and give each of them a different name. Then, have each of your friends install Mycelium on their phones. Then, for each person, export the xPubKey for their specific account via the Ledger app and have them add it as a new account in their local copy of Mycelium.
Now when they want to send their BTC to you for safekeeping, they will send it to the account they just added in their copy of Mycelium. Mycelium also does a great job of spending from paper wallets, so it is very easy for them to do at any time.
This way, their balances will remain independent of one another, they can add to their own balances at any time, and they can always open Mycelium and see how much their BTC is worth all while storing it with the top-tier security that Ledger offers.
If they want to "withdraw", they can start a new HD wallet locally on their phone and text you the deposit address along with how much they want you to send from their wallet.
It's a great way to go if you really want to pull this off. If they were operating above board in the first place, a $20 HW.1 could have prevented the entire meltdown of MTGOX.

I've long felt that LibertyX would be perfect for this. They already have an established cash-to-BTC ecosystem and their system was originally built on collecting cash and printing a receipt with a PIN code on it. Literally exactly what Coinstar does. Plus LibertyX has already ironed out the issues of price volatility between PIN purchase and redemption for BTC. This would truly be a cakewalk for the two companies.
Edit to add: There's hardly any change required to the machines. In case you're not aware, they are already outfitted with gift card printing. It is simply a matter of adding LibertyX to the list of gift cards you can buy through the system. I'm slowly changing a picnic cooler full of change into Amazon gift cards. There's no fee when you choose a gift card for your payout.

Now I see where you are coming from.
No, the coins are not economically linked at all. Once they split, you will have the keys (and balances) in both chains. But the balances will be denominated in that respective coin, not USD. So if you have 1,000 BTC today, you will have 1,000 BTCv1 and 1,000 BTCv2 (in the same address(es) on both chains) after the split. The market will decide how much BTCv1 and BTCv2 are worth in USD, but one will likely (surely) be worth far less than the other.
The market value is determined by the usefulness and desirability of the coin, not by how much cash was invested in it up until the point of the split. Similarly, Ethereum (v1, if you will) is worth about $1.64 each right now, while the new-and-improved Ethereum "v2" (which actually retained the name "Ethereum") is worth about $30.

An output is how an address receives and holds BTC. When that address is asked to send BTC out, it uses one or more outputs as the inputs to the spend transaction. Unspent outputs are what your wallet adds up and shows as a balance in a given address. When spending, enough outputs that cover the amount you're asking to send are converted into inputs in the spend transaction. The transaction takes those inputs and designates at least two addresses to receive the BTC -- the address you specified to receive a set amount of BTC and the next address in your wallet which is where all the BTC left over from the unspent outputs go after being reduced by the amount you sent to a specified address.

In the US, you are allowed to gift someone up to $14,000 before the gift itself becomes taxable, and even then it is taxable to the gift giver, not the recipient. That is the core underpinning to r/millionairemakers. Mods pick a winner each month, and each person who entered but didn't win is supposed to donate to the selected winner. No money is collected ahead of time since that would make it a lottery. Crypto is featured prominently over there. Unfortunately, the mods couldn't hold off waves of players who walk away from their responsibility to pay, and it is quite useless.
That being said, I am no tax attorney, but I would posit that you do not escape capital gains unless you donate to a specific organizations like a registered nonprofit. We see reminders at the end of each year that you can donate to certain organizations and avoid gains. There are ways that families preserve wealth after death, as well.
No, you can't just pass the "free money" you've made back and forth between friends to escape the capital gains.

The bad RNG was and is a real concern. A simple collision is not. Here's how I have described the address scope in the past.
If every grain of sand on Earth grew to be the size of the Earth itself, then there would still be more Bitcoin addresses associated with _each_ grain of sand on _each of those_ Earths than there are IPv4 and IPv6 addresses on the Internet.
Grains of sand. Including the ocean floor.
And that's just the Bitcoin blockchain. You would repeat the process for each unique coin that runs on a different blockchain. Collisions with good RNGs just ain't happening. People typically say it won't happen before our Sun burns out, but I prefer to describe how many addresses there really are vs how long a natural collision would take.

You would need an OTG adapter if you want to use the Nano to do the crypto heavy-lifting for Mycelium. I don't use them together that way. I keep some BTC on native HD wallets in Mycelium and I have several HD wallets on my Nano. I imported the xPubKey for each wallet on the Nano into Mycelium so I can track my balances and transfer BTC off my phone and onto my Nano if I get uncomfortable with how much I'm keeping on my phone.
I create a new HD wallet each time I buy BTC for recordkeeping purposes, so I ended up with a bunch of HD wallets, some on Mycelium, some on the Nano, and some on the Nano with read-only access on Mycelium.
If I were to use it in the way you ask, though, it would be sweet with the OTG adapter. The Nano is about half the size of my house key and sits on my keyring with me, so if I ever needed to spend in the way you're suggesting, I would just pull my keys out of my pocket, insert the Nano into the OTG and insert the OTG into the phone. Super convenient and ultimate safety.

Yup, you understood it correctly.
I have a few HD wallets based on my phone that I recreated on my Nano with the same name but a different set of keys. I list those Nano-based wallets as read-only in Mycelium. Say I bought half a BTC for $100 a couple of years ago and kept it on my phone. I only wanted to keep $100 worth on my phone, so I created a new HD wallet on my Nano with the same name and exported the xPubKey to Mycelium. Any time the balance in that wallet hosted on my phone goes too high above $100, I'll transfer some of it out to the same-named wallet on my Nano to bring the balance on my phone back down closer to $100.
Then if I ever need to spend from my Nano, I just chuck it into my laptop and send whatever I want wherever I want.
Now that you understand this, I drew up a scenario for someone yesterday. OP said their friends want to give him their BTC for safe keeping on his Nano. He could easily create several HD wallets on his Nano, one for each friend. Then he would have each friend run Mycelium on their phone. Then he would export the xPubKey _just_ for their wallet on his Nano to _their_ copy of Mycelium. Now, whenever they want to store BTC on his Nano, they just have to transfer BTC from a local wallet to a read-only copy of their wallet on the Nano all within their copy of Mycelium. They don't even have to meet up, and OP never has to know.
If any of the friends ever want to withdraw, they'll just send OP the deposit address and how much they want him to send from their wallet on his Nano. Super easy to do. I'm sure there are some state and federal laws that get in the way of his holding funds on behalf of other people, but from a technology perspective, it really is that easy.
A $15 Ledger HW.1 could have prevented the MTGOX disaster if they also had the right policies and procedures in place.

I was really effing happy. I buy through BitWage, and I had a buy coming up at any time, but it seemed delayed leading into the decision. BW always seems to charge a little more than the highest price I see on BitStamp on payday, and I thought for sure this paycheck was going to hit at $1,400. Nope. $1,130. It doesn't quite make up for overpaying a little each week, but I appreciated them putting in the effort if, in fact, that's what happened. 
As much as I decry timing the market and put my money where my mouth is, this one felt good.
Update: A week later, we're dropping through 1,000. This situation makes that spread on ETF Day so much better. I could be down $400 per coin vs. $130 right now.

I'd add BitWage to your list. Anyone can send their Direct Deposit paycheck to them and have it converted into BTC. For an additional fee, they will forward a portion of the payment on to your regular bank account or use Uphold to offer about three dozen other cryptos.

Check out the (original) Ledger Nano. It is about half the size of a house key and hangs on your keychain. Pair that up with a similarly sized OTG adapter and an Android phone and you can spend from one of the best hardware wallets available no matter where you are located.
There's no need to spend $100, no bulky devices and no cables. Plug one device into another, the second one into your phone and you're good to go. Sorry this happened to you, but if you do come back it is not difficult or expensive to shoot right to the top in security and convenience for protecting your balances.

Numbers 3, 4, and 5 can get you into very serious trouble if you are not licensed to handle other people's money. It is not something you can just decide to do and stay within the law. 
Something like ShapeShift Prism may be something interesting whereby individuals may place balances in Ethereum and let you use that balance to create and manage a mix of dozens of cryptocurrencies for them. As they would also have the private key that controls the prism, they would also be able to change their asset mix or cash out at any time.

So long as you have your word list, your balances are never at risk (unless someone _else_ has your word list, too). Ledger says this every chance they get.
I, too, recently updated my Nano S after not touching it for 18 months or so. I had never run Ledger Live before and had no idea what I was in for. I got my word list ready, installed Ledger Live, deleted all the apps off the Nano S, updated the firmware, and then reinstalled the coin apps one at a time to add the balances to my portfolio.
I was expecting to have to re-enter my word list, but never needed to. The difference is I've known for years there's nothing I can do to my Nano S that would suddenly make my balances disappear.
Not saying the Trezor isn't any good, but I am saying there are people out here who have come back to Ledger after a very long time and didn't skip a beat. You could drop your Nano off of a cruise ship and still not panic.

Yes, but the feds will take notice after you transact a certain amount. Also, you cannot sell to anyone who lives in the State of NY. There is an extra pile of paperwork and process to go through if you want to compete with financial institutions on their home turf.
They have threatened to go after anyone worldwide who sells BTC to a resident of NY, no matter where the transaction occurs. Imagine a New York resident is just finishing up a trip to Europe and doesn't want to bring any Euros back home. They buy some BTC with the last 100 Euros in their pocket before heading to the airport. NY has laid claim to prosecute the person who sold the BTC to that New York resident. They want every seller worldwide -- personal or business -- to verify that every buyer is not a resident of New York before selling them BTC.
That is why so many exchanges exclude New Yorkers. They shot themselves in the foot and called it innovation.

Keys are generated and held deep inside the secure zone. The users do not get anywhere near them, so there's no user code that can be hacked to send the keys anywhere.
The rest points back to the size of the packaging. If you're familiar with the Trezor, I can understand considering the possibility of having GPS receiver secretly installed. The legacy Ledger devices were _tiny_. The HW.1 was the size (and thickness!) of my pinky nail. That is SMALL. The original Nano is exactly the same hardware as the HW.1, but has some enhanced packing around it for protection. The chip is embedded in plastic, which is in turn covered by a rotating metal, well, cover. The entire original Nano is half the length, the same thickness as my house key (not counting the protective metal sheathing), and is wide enough to double as the USB connector.
For the legacy devices, there is just no room for a secret GPS receiver and the packaging is designed to make it ridiculously obvious if someone tampered with the chip. It is the same chip embedded in your bank card. You can take an old card, cut away everything but the chip, and see for yourself if you think it's possible. 
Now the S is about 3x the size of the Nano and 5-6x the size of the HW.1 and I've seen GPS receivers that size. I suppose it's possible, but the adversary would have to replace all of the internal components of the S with the GPS receiver and install the chip from the HW.1 and original Nano to preserve at least the BTC functionality for an otherwise unsuspecting user. Of course, the built in screen - its main selling point - would not function in this scenario.
That doesn't even touch upon the fact that all of their devices perform attestation tests at boot up, and will not function if the firmware was not signed by Ledger. So even if someone could replace the internals of an S with a GPS plus a Nano chip, they still couldn't modify the firmware and get it to boot. 
Good question. Thank you!

Took me a minute to understand the value in doing this -- basically offering to buy above the current price. Then it struck me as a way to buy at the bottom of a moonshot. Once the price reaches a certain level over the current price, then get in with a buy early on. Nice way to catch a ride without risking a big loss should the ETF get denied.

This comes up quite often around here. Keep in mind that if you buy BTC this way, you can easily reverse the transaction months later, keeping the BTC and getting your money back. And you specifically mentioned wanting to do this without identifying yourself to the seller. If you can find a seller, expect to pay a much higher price because of the persistent risk of fraud. 
@_date: 2017-01-03 12:02:00


No it isn't in the US. You're still responsible for the capital gains you made on that once you sell or spend it. You are also required to report how much each group of Satoshis were worth when you acquired them and how much they were worth when you sold or spent them. Being from a faucet, I'm betting they were all worth $0.00 when you acquired them.
Now that they're worth something, you will be required to pay Uncle Sam about 23 cents of every dollar's worth you sell or spend down the road -- again, if you're in the US. 
With the newcomers here, now is a good time to remind everyone that in the US if it goes up while you hodl, you will need to pay tax on the "free money" you think you earned once you sell or spend it or convert it into another crypto. Some other countries have expressly said it is free money while others are taking a similar approach to that of the US.

It is quite secure as I understand it. It even has some advanced features such as being able to specify exactly which BTC to spend when constructing a transaction. I never recommend it because I consider it to be the reference implementation (software development term). It is not noob friendly. It requires a ridiculous amount of space. And finally, the process for determining the correct fee to pay appears to be mind numbing to a newcomer, which can and frequently does result in transactions being stuck in an unconfirmed state for hours or days.
Also, you can only imagine how many panicked newcomers show up here when their BTC isn't showing up for days because they didn't realize how long it would take for their new wallet to download the entire blockchain and eventually locate the transaction that placed the balance in their address. 
To be fair, when switching to a typical mobile wallet, you are giving up a lot of privacy to the nodes that are assisting in processing your transaction and telling you your balance and that freaks a lot of people out. It is not the pure, decentralized Bitcoin that Satoshi described, although he did say not everyone will need to run a full node. 
I use a Ledger Nano for long term storage and for receiving part of my paycheck and I also use Mycelium on Android for walking around money. I never calculate a fee, and I've never had a stuck transaction. I also start a new HD wallet each time I buy so I don't need to pick the exact UTXO to spend for accounting purposes -- I know the cost basis for all UTXOs in a given HD wallet. 
Go through the history here and see how many usability issues people faced by using Core vs the major alternatives (Trezor, Ledger, Bread Wallet, and Mycelium). Try to find any of the major alternatives with stuck transactions (not caused by the user selecting "none" for the fee). 
On the flip side, I'd say the number of people who lose their BTC by not backing up their wallet.dat just about matches the number of people who lose all their BTC by not writing down their seed words, so that's a wash.

Correct. You may need to explain it to them that you're not running an exchange, but legally you're in the clear. Understand that if they close your account without reason (and we've seen all the majors do it over the years) anti money laundering and know your customer laws prevent them from telling you that they are still suspicious about your activities even after explaining to them what you're doing.
For my first couple of years of buying, I withdrew cash and bought via LibertyX whenever the mood struck me. They partner with hundreds (thousands?) of small stores across the US to sell BTC and only accept cash. I eventually moved on to buying via Bitwage, who uses a bank different from my primary bank so I'm still not getting my primary bank involved in my buying activities.
You can line up all your ducks in a neat little row and still get a generic letter stating they're closing your account and you have 30 days to withdraw your funds. We've seen it _so_ many times in here over the years it's not even funny.

It is new fiat but in an unrelated money system. I recently described it as someone offering to match the number of dollars in your wallet with the exact same number of euros at a specific moment in time. 
I mean, it's nice and all, but you can't take it to the supermarket and buy anything with it. You should be able to find a bank that will change out the euros for dollars, though. 
The second phase of it, though, was when the buyers supported the price. That either came from other cryptos or (more likely, IMHO) came from fiat that was waiting on the sidelines for something like BTC to buy. 
Within the universe of BTC and popular crypto, it is easy to say that it had to cannibalize something else. When you include externalities, you can see the $5B wasn't created from thin air. Your statements (and we see this a lot at fork time) assumes that all money that is destined to get into crypto is already in it.

If you're in the US, you can get signed up at LibertyX pretty quickly. Once you do, look for a local store and check each store's fee carefully. They can vary from $1 + 1.5% to 12% or more. Their transfers are legendarily fast, too, because they only take cash.
You typically walk in, tell them you want to buy from LibertyX and how much you want to buy. You pull up the app, initiate a buy, copy and paste your current Bitcoin deposit address into the appropriate place and click Submit. You'll see a code pop up. Then you'll hand over the cash and show them the code. They take their cut and type in the code. You switch to your wallet (Bread, Mycelium, whatever) and watch the deposit start almost immediately. 
Very fast, very clean. They don't do web wallets and you can't sell BTC to or through them. They do one specific thing and they do it well. Sell BTC to you.

For now, sure. It was $85 for a long time and I was an effin idiot for waiting until it hit $320. So when it dropped back to $150, I jumped on it. It may drop back down to $85 for the September shipment, but I was getting too much into ETH and ERC20 tokens to wait any longer.
tl;dr Yes, but it hasn't always been. Plus, I got same day delivery vs waiting literally for weeks or months.

I don't want every purchase to become a taxable event. It makes things more complicated and it makes everything I buy secretly more expensive. Just cashed out $20,000 to buy a car? Guess what. You'll now owe about $7,000 to $9,000 more next April depending on how old that BTC was and how much you paid to acquire it in the first place. Don't have that much sitting around in cash? Sell more BTC to pay your tax bill, and do it all over again next year. 
Unless you simplify things and cash out to a Gyft gift card every month or two, it becomes a real PITA real quick figuring out how much you made or lost at each transaction.

God damn, this sucks. Why the hell did I go to bed?

They even trace second hops. Say you've never gambled once or bought something off a DNM. If you have sent BTC to someone for any legitimate reason and they in turn spent the BTC at a place that Coinbase doesn't like, you will get banned for seemingly no reason.
Without tumbling, it is very easy to see where the BTC you spend ends up. You could easily transfer some BTC to a paper wallet before sending it on to a DNM and try to deny it was you. Even sending it to a tumbler is likely to be suspicious enough anymore as it is evident you are trying to put a gap between you holding some BTC and where it ends up. 
Simply put, they follow state and federal regulations.

I met Eric and bought my first Nano from him. I've interacted with him and some others many times over the years. They've had plenty of opportunities to abscond with tens or hundreds of millions of dollars by now. If you're concerned about them colluding with US authorities, they insist they've built their products to ensure that only the person with the word list and passcode can access the keys. At some point, yes, you have to trust what they've done.
My experience with open source goes back to 1993. I was on the front lines working to bring Linux into corporate data centers around Y2K. I have a deep appreciation for the ethos of the open source movement. That being said, it does not guarantee perfect safety. An SSL bug was out there for what, 20 years? Plus, the way the Trezor team abandoned the licensing model the moment someone cloned their product proved to me that they embrace it just to get the ticky mark on their product materials.
Now, time heals all wounds and many (most?) people here by now weren't around when that happened, so they likely don't care. It was nasty when it happened, though. They were the first movers and basically created an industry, IMHO, but they have had multiple security incidents and showed their true dedication to the open source philosophy when put to the test.
Compare that to the chip at the heart of the Ledger devices and the experience they brought to design and manufacturing and the choice becomes much easier to me. Believe me, when I showed up at NABC '15, I kept chanting, "Trezor. Trezor. Trezor." in my head until they weren't there and I met Eric from Ledger. He convinced me and they've all kept me as a happy customer ever since.
When I bought my Nano from Eric, he convinced me that they were soon adding 2FA by phone. When he blogged about winning all sorts of technology awards for French companies and the upcoming S, I wrote to him directly and told him that I'm still waiting for him to fulfill his promise of adding 2FA by phone to the original Nano. Five hours later, he shot a video right then and there in the middle of a fintech conference he was attending demonstrating the progress they were making on 2FA by phone and that it would enter Beta shortly. He then wrote back to me personally, said that I was right, and pointed me to the video he had just posted to see the progress. That was pretty cool of him.
tl;dr I've been into Open Source since the mid 90s, so I understand its value and purpose. Trezor abandoned it as soon as someone copied their work and switched back when the community slaughtered them. To me, it's more important to some of the users than Trezor themselves. The Ledger guys seem more mature and way more experienced in fintech and I trust them.

I don't see LibertyX listed. I am allowed $1,000/day or $2,500/week with them. They partner with small stores around the country and sell over the counter for cash only. The fees can vary wildly from store to store, but I did find a store near my current assignment at work that charges $1 + 1.5%. I paid 12% in Manhattan once. Ouch.
Since they only accept cash, transfers are instant. Also they don't offer web wallets, so the deposits go into real wallets that you control (should you specify one).

Yes. They said all along you wouldn't be able to claim the new coin. Besides, you are always at a higher risk leaving balances at Coinbase. As we always say around here, "You don't have BTC at Coinbase. You have IOUs that you have to hope they will honor when you ask for some BTC."

Sounds like you're actually referring to Bitwage since you want to receive some or all of your wages in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency. BitPay is how business owners can easily allow customers to pay with Bitcoin. Nothing to do with employee wages. 
Is your employer based in the US? Once you sign up with Bitwage, you tell your employer to electronically deposit your paycheck into a bank account that Bitwage has dedicated just to you. Then you tell Bitwage how you want to receive your payment.
I believe their basic account allows you to specify two parts for your paycheck. You may wish to receive $100 worth in BTC and then have the rest deposited into your bank account in Pakistan (if they support deposits there, I don't know.) You may also send one of your splits to a company called Uphold, who can then offer to deliver the portion you allocate to them in any of 35(?) cryptocurrencies or cash in your bank account. If Bitwage does not support depositing some of your paycheck in a Pakistani bank account, Uphold will likely do that for you. 
Note that there is a $10 monthly charge for customizing your payments if you choose to receive your paycheck in any arrangement other than purely Bitcoin. Uphold may also charge a fee for their services. I don't use them, so I don't know. 
I receive 100% of one of my paychecks in BTC, so I don't pay any extra fees unless and until I decide to change out some BTC to another crypto at ShapeShift.

I moved five accounts over. It's no big deal. It's just not a big red button to press, that's all. See my other top level comment for the steps in compressed form.
All you need to understand is that the BCH Split view is based on a whole new set of keys. The Main view is using the same keys as your BTC side.
So all you do is go into the BCH Split view, select your account, click Receive, copy the receive address, go into the BCH Main view and send your balance to the receive address you copied in the BCH Split view. I was nervous the first time, so I only sent 4 cents. Then I said, "Oh. That was it?"

I agree with the assertion that it is no longer free software at that point. However, I'm not one of the free software zealots who will use free software or nothing (as evidenced by my support of the Ledger team and their products). 
It has actually been a source of internal conflict for 20 years. I learned about the GPL first and thought it was perfect freedom. Everyone gets everything released under that license for free and pays people for tweaks and support. That's how you end up with DD-WRT and Raspberry Pi. Other license models claim to be freer since people are able to make derivatives and lock them down. That's how you end up with Apple. Depends on how far you want to take the word free. Is the _software_ freely available forever, or are the _people_ free to do as they wish? Even if it means charging exorbitant fees to deliver and support software with minor modifications? (Exaggerating to make a point, of course.) 
I've never looked at Luke's work, but I've heard many people comment about his contributions (both good and bad). I remember when he tried to inject a whitelisting feature into the default compilation options for Gentoo and that wasn't well-received. Would that have made it no longer free? No, but it would have taken Bitcoin in a direction that basically no one wanted -- at least in a very small segment of the community. Another example of too much power consolidated in one person's hands. I wonder if that's why he's swung in the opposite direction now. Maybe he had a grand realization. If what he tried to do was abusing power, perhaps he now refuses to support any condition that centralizes power in the hands of the few. He recognizes it because he's literally been there, done that.
If you really want help forming an opinion on freedom and how it applies in this space, spend some time in Nick Szabo's library, only to be found here now. I'm particularly interested in his discussions about trust.

If you need to prove to someone that you can spend the funds in a given address, you can digitally sign a message using the private key. They can then use the receiving address to verify that someone who can spend those funds did indeed write the message.
That's why it's important to include some unique and specific details in the text that you're guaranteeing comes from you.
So in a sub called r/millionairemakers, they randomly select one person from thousands who enter into a monthly drawing to receive $1 from everyone else via a variety of methods. The payout is voluntary, so people being people, most just congratulate the winner with, "Sent my $1 via PayPal" and walk away. When I was playing, I paid by Bitcoin but made it interesting.
To enter the contest, you write a comment on the monthly entry thread. I used to create a single-use address and transfer $1 into it first. Then I would construct my entry comment and digitally sign it using the private key to the address that held the $1. Since the winner ultimately publishes their Bitcoin deposit address, I made it easy for anyone to go back and verify that I took the moral high ground.
Anyone could see that I intended all along to give the $1 that I set aside for the eventual winner. They could see that I put the $1 aside before the contest even started. Since the winner published a deposit address, it was easy to check the blockchain at any time and see that not only did I pay the winner, but that I paid them right after they won. I didn't go back and pay all the past winners that I had previously ignored like so many other winners.
There was also a side benefit of publishing the address I would use to my receive my winnings should I ever win. I knew that it would be easy to see if I won the drawing for the month because I would have seen dozens of deposits suddenly hitting the single-use address I listed in my entry. Each time I woke up the next morning after the late night drawings and still saw the balance of the single-use address I used for that month at $1, I knew I hadn't won the night before.
When you digitally sign a message, the signature block includes the Bitcoin address associated with your private key as well as cryptographic data that proves the message came from the holder of the private key associated with the Bitcoin address. It's just like PGP or GPG, but with Bitcoin addresses and their associated private keys. Anyone can then take any message you digitally sign, pair it up with the Bitcoin address shown in the signature block, and verify that the signed text came from someone who does indeed possess the private key to that address.

Only if the balances sit in wallets that have ever been used to spend or sign. That's part of the attraction of using HD wallets. Every time you spend any amount, they automatically transfer any leftover balance into a brand new, never-before-seen address. That act alone makes those balances invulnerable to the type of attack I described.
A free app in the major app stores would go a long way towards improving their long term security but a $20 hardware wallet like the HW.1 would go much further.
Yes, many of those missing/lost coins do make the coins still under someone's control more valuable. I just wanted to point out that stale BTC sitting in a non-HD wallet that has been used in a spend transaction before will likely be captured and returned to circulation once that type of attack is developed and matured.

False. Not sure where this started, but a bunch of people over the years thought Shapeshifting between cryptos was tax free. That you could start with a dollar and Shapeshift your way to $10 million tax free until you turn it into fiat.

@_date: 2017-08-19 14:47:12
Yes, but understand that you will pay a transaction fee to move your coins over to the Ledger device. It looks the same as any other transfer between addresses.
Something I forgot to mention in Trezor's favor. From the beginning, they have supported hidden wallets. If you are under duress, you could provide seemingly legitimate details to an "interested party" who would use those details to successfully unlock and gain access to balances stored under that profile. However, your "real" balances would be stored under a completely different profile on the same device. The interested parties would have no indication that they were given a dummy profile with just enough coin in it to convince them that you're actually not that interesting. That feature is just coming to the Nano S (and may already be here). Either way, Trezor had it forever.
Another feature of the Ledger that I appreciate (and Trezor may have this, too) is the native support for multiple wallets all derived from the same word list. I prefer to start a new wallet every time I buy BTC. I name the wallet with the date and exchange rate at which I purchased that BTC. That way, when (if) I go to spend BTC, I look at the current price (which I always keep in the notification area on my phone) and choose the wallet that was funded with coin closest to the current price. If I spend BTC that I paid the same or more than the current value to acquire, then the capital gains would be zero, so long as I can prove it. By having a completely independent sequence of addresses associated with each purchase, that makes it easy to prove the cost basis at acquisition and the cost basis at disposition or sale for a given tranche of BTC.
Therefore, I take full advantage of the Ledger's ability to create a new wallet, complete with its own name and address sequence. In fact, I take it a step further. I do the same thing on Mycelium. Since the Ledger supports exporting an entire HD wallet in one address, I maintain two sets of addresses in Mycelium on my phone: one set where I have the private keys stored on my phone and another set that are imports of all of my Ledger-based wallets using the same name as the wallets I have in Mycelium.
What's the point? Say I have five wallets on my phone and I've created five other wallets on my Ledger with the same exact set of names. I have spendable balances in the wallets on my phone and I've imported the exports from Ledger of the five same-named wallets on my Ledger. Since I've imported the Ledger exports, all I can do on my phone is deposit funds into my Ledger-based wallets and check the balances on my Ledger-based wallets.
So as the price continues to rise, I sometimes get uncomfortable with how much spendable balances are on my phone. All I have to do is transfer some of the balances out of my phone-based wallets into the Ledger exports also listed in Mycelium. That gets the balances off my phone, moves them to the Ledger for safer storage, but has zero impact on the total balances displayed on my phone (other than the transaction fee required to transfer the funds). I do it right on my phone. I don't need to fire up my Nano to deposit funds -- only to spend.
Using that mechanism, I could offer to hold BTC for friends who don't want to invest in a hardware wallet. Just create an account for them on my wallet and give them the export. Then they can deposit funds into their addresses on my Nano whenever they want. They would need to ask me to send any balances out, but they could deposit funds whenever they want without asking or telling me. It gets very messy when you start offering to hold funds for other people without a license, though, so obviously I don't do that.

Mycelium is an HD wallet and aggressively uses new addresses after certain transactions. All of the addresses are linked and Mycelium treats all of the balances in the linked addresses as a single wallet to simplify the user experience.
Were you checking the balance of your Mycelium wallet at blockchain.info or something? The "current address" changes after every transaction but if you're monitoring the fixed address via a web site or other tool, they will often show 0 as Mycelium has moved the balance to the next address in the sequence.

The blockchain is just a list of "who owns what". The coins were just the first "thing" whose ownership is tracked on the blockchain. You may tie ownership of just about anything to BTC: land, vehicles, stocks and bonds, a vote in an election, anything. 
When you see news articles about some big company or government agency adopting blockchain technology, this is what they're talking about. It costs them nothing to store tiny pieces of information on a globally replicated database that cannot be changed (without a lot of work and agreement). The best data to store would be a hash of some digital content, proving to the world that the digital content in question existed in exactly that form at that precise moment in time.
Digital content can be anything. A song. A scan of a signed contract. A property deed listing someone as the rightful owner. Anything that can be digitized can be proven to have existed in a specific form at a specific point in time thanks to blockchain, the technology behind Bitcoin.

I'm sure we can come up with 12 different collections that are tied together by one common feature. Perhaps post all of the most popular videos one month, wiki pages another month, positive mainstream media coverage, false Satoshi outings, Bitcoin obituaries, some popular quotes or actions by high profile personalities, fulfilled and unfulfilled giveaways, big exchange hacks, exchange abuse and unexplained user account cancellations, the most popular approaches to securing your Bitcoin, privacy protection and anonymization techniques, law enforcement actions, tax guidance, socio-political and economic theory, where can you spend your Bitcoin, etc. Then we'd have one megathread on a given topic each month and the multi would have few enough entries that it would be relatively quiet. And an easy place to find stuff that comes up a lot.
Again, I'm sorry it came across so mean spirited. It caught me at a bad time and I honestly thought we saw it last week. At least showing you the search gives you an idea as to the velocity of information and repetition seen in the more popular subs. All subs' rule  is "search before you post".

Some of us remember some issues with Trezor in the past.
When I first showed up in these parts, it was possible to sniff keys in RF leaking from the USB cable. That was fixed quickly  Then, as much as they touted being fully open source, they changed their license as soon as a cheap Chinese knockoff appeared. After two days of being lambasted by the community, they switched back. Also, they relied upon tamper evident seals to reassure end users that the devices were arriving with official firmware. A bunch of devices showed up in the mail with the tamper evident seal destroyed. People were returning or throwing away their devices upon arrival. And now the most recent issue affecting the devices.
Ledger devices have always shipped with internal checks so you know if it boots, the firmware is legit. People freaked when their devices arrived without any kind of tamper evident sticker until they learned that they didn't need one. 
Their devices are built around the smart chip that has protected bank card transactions for two decades (not a general purpose processor) and the Ledger team had deep experience in that space prior to entering the business. The chip itself on the earlier devices doubles as the USB connector, so there was no need to risk a leaky USB cable. You literally have to completely destroy the device to get anywhere near where the keys are stored. At one point you needed $2,000 worth of equipment to get the keys out of a Trezor when you needed over 1 million dollars' worth to "safely" destroy a Ledger device and access the keys. 
Ledger has open sourced all the code they legally could on their earlier devices. I haven't looked at the licensing for the Nano S. 
I bought my Nano directly from Eric's hands at NABC '15 and I grew to trust the company and their skills more and more over the years. They just seem so much more professional.

I've created individual HD wallets for each purchase from the beginning and labeled them with the purchase date and cost basis. 
One way to sanely cash out is to buy gift cards from Gyft in big chunks with the same cost basis. $500 at Amazon, for instance. For a while, I was buying $200-$300 a week. Each of those may cover a month's worth of purchases down the road. 
Edit: I agree that the thought of spending &lt;$10 at a time, all at a different cost basis, would make for an accounting nightmare. Spending several hundred dollars at one cost basis in and one cost basis out takes away much of that complexity.

Ah, so the app that replaces the secure card offers 2FA by phone. If the PC you use is compromised and your keystrokes are recorded, you gradually reveal the entire keymap to anyone who's watching. Switching to 2FA by phone eliminates that risk. In order to execute a fraudulent transaction with this setup, someone would need to hack your Nano (which won't even boot up if the firmware has been changed), your PC _and_ the 2FA app on your phone. You mentioned you don't trust the app, though.
Second is the main subject of our chat, Ledger Trustlet. This is the app that gets installed in the Trustonic Trusted Execution Environment to emulate a Nano. The Trustonic TEE is primarily found on newer Samsung devices (S6 and Note 4 and newer) but can also be found on specific models from other manufacturers. You interact with the Trustlet through mobile apps like Mycelium and Greenbits the same way you would if you plugged your Nano directly into any Android's USB port.
Here is more information about the Trustonic TEE.

A stock split doubles your shares but cuts the value of each share in half. A fork gives you an identical number of "shares" of an entirely new currency that may or may not be worth anywhere near as much as the initial currency from which the new currency was forked.
It is like printing money, but in two different money systems that don't work with one another. Imagine if, at the time of the fork, someone said: "I'll give you 1-for-1 in euros as many dollars you have in your wallet." You can't take euros to your supermarket in the US and expect to spend them. But you can take them to change bureaus or maybe your bank and change them out for USD. (My bank wouldn't take Brazilian Reals when I returned.)
@_date: 2016-11-18 12:04:23
No I, too, have the original Nano. The app that eliminates the need for the secure card is different; that is just a new approach to 2FA.
The Trustlet recreates the entire Nano in the secure area on the newer Samsung phones. There are literally millions of people who have all the necessary hardware to run a Nano inside their phones and have no idea.

Once you find a method, bear in mind that PayPal will come at the worst rates for you, the buyer. This is because you can easily reverse the charges with PayPal months later, but the seller cannot take back the BTC you bought from him.
Therefore, it is always in their best interest to charge PayPal buyers way more than for cash customers.

Exactly. Bitaddress was right in the post. Do people actually believe we all posted an address from the middle of our HD wallets for 70 cents??

Yeah, it was not as easy as MyEtherWallet, that's for sure. Go into the BCH Split view, go into the account, click Receive, highlight and copy your receive address, click Settings, click Blockchains, click BCH Main, click Send, click Max, paste in your BCH Split receive address and confirm the tx.
I have several accounts on my Nano, and my Nano needed new firmware. So after updating, I had to rename all my recovered accounts to their meaningful names. Then I had to rename them all again in the BCH Main view. Then I had to add them and name them _again_ in the BCH Split view so that I could send all the split BCH one for one to their new Split accounts on the BCH side. That was a lot of naming and renaming.
And now that it's down $500, I'm trying to shift out and it's not going so well. I should have split them yesterday so that I would be ready to go as soon as shifting was announced.
Edit: I couldn't take it F5'ing the price while waiting for the shift to complete, so I started the shift and went out to dinner. Came back and it was done. That chapter of my life is over lol

I use Bitcoin Paranoid on Android. The current price never leaves the notification area. I just pull down from the top for a quick peek and there it is. 
@_date: 2016-11-11 01:50:12
You're not required to report any losses. You're just leaving money on the table. I setup a new HD wallet each time I bought BTC, and I put the purchase price in the name. I also run Bitcoin Paranoid so I always have the current price in my notification area. By buying at many different price levels, I can tell immediately if I have any BTC that is "safe" to spend -- meaning I bought it at or above the current price.
I then tag each transaction with the amount, purchase price and reason. It's also helpful because it makes it easy for me to see when I'm losing too much money by spending BTC that has crashed in value since I bought it.
If I didn't have any BTC that was safe to spend but wanted to, I would hit up a LibertyX to get some more at the current price. Now I'm a BitWage customer so I'm _constantly_ getting BTC at new prices.
It's really not difficult to do. It just takes a little work to make sure you're not triggering reportable events. When I go to spend, I just look at my list of wallets and find one that was funded with slightly more expensive BTC. That way I don't lose too much money on each transaction and I don't have any reportable events.
@_date: 2017-08-09 19:02:57
Sure thing. I have to admit I was wrong so far about the price. It was dropping while I was writing it, but it made a pretty solid U-turn at $200. January is a really long way off, but it didn't tank straight to sub $1 as I thought it would.

No. You can multiply 21 million by 100 million to count the smallest measurable unit of value. BTC has to reach $1 million each just to get the smallest unit of measure to equal one cent. It's at $732 right now. And there's no rule that says that the smallest unit of value cannot exceed one cent. That would just be a coincidence if it happens. 
There's plenty of room to the upside to represent value. No need to increase the supply and reduce the value of all of them.

I don't partake in that kind of activity, so I'm not the one to provide advice. I can only tell you we've seen numerous people have their accounts shutdown unexpectedly even when doing perfectly legal things with their BTC.
My only suggestion is to keep really good records of how much each coin costs when you buy and sell. In the US, you are responsible for capital gains when you sell or spend BTC and when you change it out for another crypto. Some people incorrectly believe that all cryptos are equal in the eyes of the IRS and that you don't owe capital gains specifically until you sell it for fiat. They think you can swap in and out of all cryptos and keep all the gains until you sell them for cash. Bad idea. 
@_date: 2016-11-05 05:36:18
I didn't challenge your assertion, but the clip you quoted still sounds like it is secure storage for private keys. I did some quick Googling and saw no evidence that it is a separate trusted execution module, "just" extremely secure storage. I'm open to correction, but I can only see evidence of highly secure data storage.
For true trusted execution, check out the TEE on newer Samsung phones S6 and above and the Note 4 and above. You can deploy code into that isolated environment and you don't have to trust user accessible code to safely generate and push the private keys to secure storage. All of that is done in an area that the user cannot reach. 
Ledger, the team behind the Nano and Nano S is testing a port of their Nano code to the TEE and are calling it the Trustlet. It interacts with mobile apps like Mycelium the same exact way that their Nano and HW.1 do, doing the crypto heavy lifting for the app. The Trustlet executes in a secure, isolated area on the phone and stores the private keys in there as well. 
That is truly like using a hardware wallet. Not "just" pushing keys into highly secure storage. Apple obviously upped the game with secure storage. I just can't find evidence that it is a Trusted Execution Environment like what Samsung has.

Ugh. Blockchain has a history of unsafe key generation practices. You could have 10-way authentication turned on and someone could have worked out your private key just based on you depositing the funds in there. I don't foresee a positive outcome here, unless they determine that's what happened (again) and refund you. 
We _always_ talk about Mycelium for Android and Bread Wallet for iOS in here. If you're not writing down 12 (or 25) words to protect your balances, this can happen somewhat easily and for a variety of reasons.

@_date: 2016-11-17 21:24:37
There is a notable difference. Apple has secure storage for keys but the app that pushes the key into storage runs in userspace. On some Android devices -- primarily the Galaxy S 6 and Note 4 and above -- there is an isolated environment called the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). The Ledger guys have ported the code running on their Nano to run in that TEE, called the Trustlet. 
If you have the TEE, install the Trustlet and you will have truly secure hardware running the Ledger code in a protected area on the device. Not a userland app that is pushing your keys into a secure storage area.

Honestly, your post history is a more than a little scary.
You're desperately selling 8 BTC right now. A month ago you were desperately selling 4.5. You were also begging for $1.30. Someone asked you why you're begging for $1.30 and trying to sell over $5,500 worth. Then you wanted to sell your BTC for eBay credits -- no wait, now it's PayPal. You were selling for half off, now just a slight discount. You absolutely could not wait a month ago, yet here you are a month later with almost twice as much you still desperately need to sell. You tried selling an old guitar.
If you had just registered with an exchange, this would likely have been done a while ago. I was willing to come meet you in NYC according to one of your posts, but you're not in NYC -- that was a typo for BTC. At one point you said you opened a GoFundMe but then posted a Bitcoin address on your GoFundMe announcement. Instead of correcting the post to show the GoFundMe page in the GoFundMe sub, you just deleted the post.
What's really going on? Sorry to be so doubtful, but your comment history is all over the place, especially for a 1 month old account. Begging for less than $2, selling stuff, desperate to sell over $2,000 in BTC then suddenly desperately selling twice as much BTC a month later.

Each block adds a set of transactions to the permanent record. It is supposed to occur about every 10 minutes by design but sometimes doesn't occur for up to an hour. There are differing opinions within the community as to when a transaction is considered permanent or irreversible.
It takes a lot of work to try to reverse or alter a transaction that has been verified as legitimate by multiple nodes. It is damn near impossible to reverse a transaction that has been included in a block and therefore made part of the permanent record.
@_date: 2016-11-18 13:53:09
Correct. Buying alone is not a taxable event. Neither is selling at a loss (but you are leaving money on the table if you don't claim it). Gains are reportable above 50 cents. Gains made while swapping cryptos are also reportable. So if you're going to play with some ether or an alt and can only buy it with BTC, it's better to buy new BTC and swap it into the alt immediately so as to not earn any gains while you held it.
I will even establish a separate single-use wallet just for that transaction. No sense in wasting an HD wallet for something that simple. Hit up a LibertyX, buy some BTC and deposit it into a single use wallet and then ship it right back out to shapeshift or whatever to flip it into an alt.

Keurig. I can't stand single use k-cups. So wasteful, IMHO. I bought a 4-pack of [these]( at Bed, Bath and Beyond and absolutely love 'em. Lets you use any ground coffee with your maker. I only use standard K-Cups when I swipe them from hotel rooms.
Be careful if you go looking for the filters, though, because the K-Cup design changed when their patent expired so make sure you get the right design for your maker.
If you use a French press now, you will be let down, though, because the filters (and cups) hold about half as much coffee as you probably used in the press. You can always run two "halfies" to make up for it. I felt like I was going through detox when I first started using K-Cups lol

Bitwage. They aim to charge a 2% fee on each purchase. If you do not want your entire paycheck to be sent to you in BTC, they charge $10/mo to split up the payment however you wish, so it is better to convert your entire paycheck if you can. My employer doesn't support splitting up my direct deposit, but I have two independent direct deposit streams so I'm able to receive the smaller one as 100% BTC. 
The verification was pretty rigorous and they don't allow you to deposit your own money at a bank branch outside of direct deposit. 
They support xpubkey which is great. You can create a new HD wallet in Mycelium or Ledger Wallet and give the master public key to them. Each deposit will land in the next address in the sequence, improving your privacy. I send mine to Ledger and added the same to Mycelium as a Watch Only pubkey so I can see every deposit and monitor the balance without putting my balances at risk.

Based on the timing and the amounts withdrawn, I assumed they were payments to a lawyer who accepts BTC for payment. I didn't do the math, but it doesn't appear at first blush that the withdrawals were to sweep the donation address the way I suggested above.

It's not my main source of income. I travel a ton for work, and any travel expenses I cover in cash get reimbursed to me in BTC. If I don't want to buy BTC in a couple of weeks, I put almost all of my expenses on my corporate credit card. If prices are on an extended downturn or I want to buy some fresh BTC, I pay for everything in cash and get it all back in BTC in a couple weeks. 
It's not _literally_ one of my paychecks. It's more like a paycheck whose amount I get to fine tune every week.

You have 9 cents more than the cost of the product. You have to pay several cents for the transaction to go through. Based on current conditions, you likely need to pay a lot more than 9 cents for it to go through. Perhaps 18 cents or 20 cents, it varies.

No, you can stack multiple moves into a single transaction and pay one fee. You are already paying the fee to send the BTC you want to send to the address you specify. Might as well maintain your privacy and protect yourself from future attacks by moving your remaining balance to a new address. 
 Spend some time on Blockchain.info and watch the transactions go by. (Click on some transaction IDs going by and) you will see some with dozens of inputs and most with two or more outputs. 
You also don't have to keep your entire stash in one HD wallet. I split up my purchases, placing each one into a new HD wallet so that I know how much money I've made or lost in each transaction.
Edit: I went to bc.i to do what I said, and I see it is difficult to do exactly what I suggested. You only see transaction IDs and total amount moved flowing by. You have to click on an id to inspect it. Check out this one that I just nabbed. This tx appears to have paid 11 recipients and kept the remaining balance (over $1.7MM) in the original address, all for a single fee of 64 cents. This behavior reduces their privacy today and will be downright dangerous in about 20 years. Moving the remaining balance to a new address the original sender controls would resolve both of those issues at once all without incurring any additional fees. Just the last address would be different from the one providing all the BTC on the input side.

In Mycelium for Android, for instance, you can go to the Accounts tab and keep clicking the key with the plus up top. That creates a new HD wallet each time. Then, after creating each new HD wallet, send whatever chunk size you want to use to the receive address shown for that wallet.
That is how I isolate my direct deposit payments. Since each one has a different cost basis for tax calculations, I start a new HD wallet with each deposit and put the exchange rate in the wallet name. Makes it easy to keep track of exactly how much I made or lost while holding each chunk of BTC.

In the future, you can ask them to digitally sign a custom message for you, proving to a certain extent that they at least have access to the private key associated with that address. That way you know that any BTC that may ultimately end up with undesirables passed through their hands before getting there instead of passing directly from your hands to theirs. 
Very interesting thought, though. When someone shows you a QR code for payment, you don't really know if they have the private key behind it. I could easily get a key from someone else and accept payments on their behalf without ever having the private key and it would look just like any other payment someone is sending to me.

I've often daydreamed about finding the boundaries. If eBay bans selling cryptos, how about selling a $50 bicycle with a paper wallet taped to the frame for $500? Or a coffee cup? How about a custom coffee cup with a picture of 12 words? What about a 500 page book with 300 words on each page? Sell it on Amazon for $99.99. When someone buys the book, you pick 12 random words from throughout the book and tell them the page number and word number for each of the 12 words. They reconstruct and then sweep the wallet to complete the sale.
Remember the old days when DVD encryption was cracked and the DMCA made it illegal to publish the code to decrypt them? People put the code on t-shirts.

They trace your funds and may penalize you if someone down the road does something unscrupulous with your coins. Say a tweaker steals his Mom's cell phone and sells it on Craigslist for Bitcoin. You have no idea of the back story, you just know it's for sale at a great price. You buy the phone using your Coinbase wallet. The seller immediately runs to his dealer and buys a new set with the Bitcoin he just got from you. Then the dealer transfers the BTC to a paper wallet he's been using to store his proceeds. Well, guess what? The FBI knows about that address and is watching all transaction flows that ultimately end up there.
They contact Coinbase about it and due to AML/KYC laws, Coinbase closes your account and are legally prohibited from discussing the reason with you. It would look exactly the same way as it does right now. You didn't do anything wrong. They closed your account. They won't tell you why.
It's just a hypothetical, of course, but do you _really_ know everything anyone you've ever sent BTC to has done with the BTC you sent to them?

You were possibly misled or misunderstand about coins not being retrievable if a device running wallet software is lost, destroyed or stolen. So long as you write down your word list (which is true for both mobile devices and hardware wallets), you can easily regain control of your balances. If the app doesn't make you write down a word list, then it is generally not worth considering (AirBitz is a clear exception to this rule).
Hardware wallet is the ultimate answer as everyone has been saying, but apps on mobile devices are not as risky as you have been led to believe. Not all apps are created equal, of course. Mycelium on Android and Bread Wallet on iOS basically set the standard on the two platforms.

Now, some HD wallet apps (like Mycelium) make it easy to generate a single use address and I don't know if Trezor offers that. If they do, then any single use addresses would become vulnerable once you spend from the address or use it to digitally sign some text.

Number 3. seems unnecessary, but yes, you get the idea.
I have a Ledger, so I transferred almost all my BTC to it before the split. Even moved one balance with 40 minutes to spare! Then I updated my Ledger device and app to support the new coin. 
So I went into the app, found the place to generate a new wallet on the new coin with new keys, and grabbed the receive address. I then went to the part of the app that showed me the new coins on my old addresses. I then sent my new coins to the new address to get them away from my old addresses. 
Did that five times for five different accounts on my device.
The last and most important point is that who knows what's going to be left by the time CB customers can access the coin. It'll be a novelty by then. 
It was $750 when I first started thinking about it, and it took so long to split and sell, that I got out at $285 a day later. It'll be close to $200 by the time I finish typing this. Who knows where it'll be come January. I personally think it'll follow DOGE.

By setting up a new HD wallet on my Ledger Nano and sending a copy of the public key only for that HD wallet to Bitwage, Bitwage deposits each BTC payment into a different address. I also imported the key into Mycelium so I can monitor all the payments that arrive in that HD wallet on my Ledger, but I can't spend from those addresses using Mycelium. I never configured my Nano to work with Mycelium, so I have to pop my Nano into my laptop to spend from any of the HD wallets on my Nano. 
I didn't do the Coinbase verification, but I did do the minimum at LibertyX. Bitwage went much further than LibertyX, and LibertyX lets me buy $2,500/wk.
Also, it's not up to your employer if you want to use Bitwage. You just change your Direct Deposit to point at your Bitwage account once you're approved. Only then if you still want to receive some of the payment in cash will you pay Bitwage $10/mo and tell them where to deposit your cash and how much you want. Your employer has no idea about any of it.

I've been working for over 20 years now, and I probably have another 15 to 17 years to go before I retire. I already have my own retirement savings plan, but this is just another one to play with. We practically own our current home and we already know we're going to inherit my wife's childhood home in 15-20 years.
I can afford to play with this money, so I'm picking some up now along the way. Who knows, I may be a Bitcoin millionaire by the time I need to count up my chips and see what I have to play with for the rest of my days.
Our retirement home is horrible in the winter, so maybe in 20 years we'll buy a summer place in the Florida Keys or Costa Rica or Panama, who knows. Or buy a nice RV and "chase 70 degrees"; that seems to be a hobby for RVers.
Combining my Bitcoin stash with selling our current home will give us a good starting point for retirement. I'm not banking on the Bitcoin stash because I don't have to. But it has the potential to make things more interesting by the time I'll likely be ready to spend it.

Gemini is one of the most legitimate operators out there. We're all assuming you are not familiar with Anti Money Laundering and Know Your Customer (AML/KYC) laws that govern businesses like Gemini. If they even suspect that you gained the money through an illegal gambling operation, then they are required to report that to the feds. They may even close your account based on that suspicion, and if they do that, they are legally required to keep their reason secret from you. 
I don't recall seeing Gemini do that to anyone around here, but other big exchanges that follow the law closely have done that to numerous people, sometimes making it difficult for people to get their money out.
If you're in the US, then any gambling site you have used was likely illegal and any exchanges that follow the law cannot legally take those winnings from you and help you invest with them.

This is why it is important for hardware wallets to display the destination address for your payment in a different place. Trezor uses a built-in screen. The Ledger Nano uses your phone. The Nano S has a built-in screen.
Understand that the Internet cannot reach the part of the hardware wallet where the private keys are stored and used. Trezor is entirely open source and will allow you to replace the software that is running on the device, while the most critical portions of the Nano are closed source and the device will not boot if you try to install software that they did not release.
When you send a transaction to the hardware wallet, you are sending a destination address for the transaction and the amount to send. The device receives the request and transfers the request to a hidden area on the device to construct and sign the transaction. The signed transaction is then returned to the device that requested the transaction in the first place (your PC or phone) which in turn broadcasts the signed transaction to the network for execution. The private keys never leave the private area on your hardware wallet.
tl;dr they are designed to work perfectly and maintain transactional integrity even when the devices you're using are loaded with malware

Totally agree, but if we want to double down on his graciousness, sending directly to addresses lets him bundle all the payments into just a couple of transactions.

There's nothing stopping you from buying unloaded coins and loading them yourself. The address for depositing funds and checking the balance can be viewed without damaging it. It's the key used for spending that is typically hidden behind tamper evident labels. 
Note that if the deposit address is not coded into a QR code, you must be PERFECT when entering the address by hand so as to not transfer value into an entirely unrelated address -- from which you will never recover the funds.

If you store BTC in a single use address (aka paper wallet, or an address you got from bitaddress.org) and have spent only a portion of the balance, leaving the remainder behind in the original address, then that entire remaining balance will be susceptible to attack by the next generation of computers expected to be mainstream within the next 20 years or so.
Same goes for digitally signing a message. If you sign a message proving that you are in control of a specific address, then you place that balance at risk of a future attack that has not been developed yet. 
The best way to protect against that type of attack is to use an HD wallet. When you spend from an HD wallet, the balance you request goes to the address you specified and any balance left over is sent to an entirely new address that you also control. That way, every address you control will always be loaded and emptied only once. No partial spends. 
Search Google for the richest Bitcoin addresses and plug each one into Blockchain.info. You'll see that about half of them have been used for multiple deposits and withdrawals. Those addresses will likely be among the first to get drained when that attack is made viable.
IIRC, there's one address where the owner moved 1 BTC in and out "just to see if it works". After satisfying themselves, they proceeded to move $42 million in (valued about 3 months ago, last time I looked).

You will see chatter in here regarding quantum computing, although that is many, many years off. When that is ready, however, any wallets built with current technology will be vulnerable to attack if they have been used to spend any balance or digitally sign a message. Say someone amassed 10,000 BTC in a single address many years ago. They sent $1 to a friend just to show them the technology, but this was before HD wallets so the rest of the balance is still there in the same address.
When quantum computers are eventually able to attack those idle wallets, those funds will be recoverable, again, IF the wallets holding those funds have ever been used to sign a message or send a portion of the balance to another address. Many of the oldest addresses in the system with those huge balances dating back to the early days had dozens of transactions and still have a balance today. Those wallets are likely among the first ones that will be attacked.
Look at the 100 richest wallets. Four of the top five will be vulnerable to quantum attacks unless their balances are moved. I was pleased to see how many have not been used to spend yet, although I don't know if they were ever used to sign a message.
Just looking over the data, here is my favorite. First they created an address 2 1/2 months ago. Then they moved ~~99 cents~~ .99 BTC in and out right away just to make sure "it works". Then over the course of the next 2 months they proceeded to move $42 million into it. They have no clue that that ~~99 cent~~ 1 BTC test transaction has put the entire balance at risk way out in the future.
If you are using single use addresses for multiple transactions, you have about 20 years to learn about HD wallets or adopt a personal policy that you will always completely empty a paper wallet if you ever spend from it (and never use it again).

You've gotta read the sidebar. And yes, the sidebar is reachable in mobile. Also take a look at r/bitcoinbeginners.
Whereas individual banks have account numbers for each customer, Bitcoin is like one big list of account numbers for everyone. There are so many, in fact, that you are supposed to use a new account number every time you send money.
There are three types of users or systems: consumers who hold and spend money, nodes that verify that every requested transaction is legitimate, and miners who get paid to make every legitimate transaction a permanent part of history.
You may buy Bitcoin in person or from service providers, you may earn it either as a straight salary or through a provider that will convert some or all of your paycheck into Bitcoin, or you may sell your stuff for it. Don't think about mining.

If you have your transaction id or addresses used in the transactions, you can use blockchain.info to pull up each address and inspect each transaction. When you mouse over the dollar amount transacted, you will see mouseover text that shows you the value at the time the transaction was executed.
You can backtrack through time, figuring out exactly what moment balances hit each address and their value at that moment in time. Now if instead, you printed paper wallets from bitaddress, loaded and emptied them before shredding or burning the paper, that's going to be a lot harder.

Even if they do send the data structured that way, they are not the final word on what you actually did with the holdings. You are responsible for telling the final version of the story.
Yes, buying and spending or selling right away is a great way to maintain a 0 change in cost basis. That's why I recommend buying fresh BTC if you need to shape shift into ether. Get in and out of your BTC at the same price to minimize the risk of price change while you're holding.

Did it ever come through? I'm surprised no one has mentioned that with large exchanges, the addresses are not yours. You are never supposed to perform an unexpected transaction with an address that was displayed to you for a prior transaction. So if you withdraw from an exchange to a real wallet where you control the keys but didn't actually need all of it, do not EVER transfer BTC back into the address that was used to send you the BTC initially. Always request a new address before sending anything. 
Those are not your addresses and they are only used as a gateway to your account, likely for just one transaction. This why people say you don't have BTC at Coinbase, you have IOUs. If you go to withdraw, they will send you BTC from their pooled addresses. 
If it still hasn't come through after all these hours, contact support. And from now on, always assume that an address that Coinbase shows you is only good for that one single request that caused them to display that address. 
Also note that even if you were transferring to an address that you did control, it is not a good idea to reuse addresses anyway. That's where everyone else's advice in here comes in. You certainly can make multiple deposits to the same address (again, ONLY if you are managing the keys), even if the address is one of several that are linked to the same key. The same is not true at Coinbase, though. The addresses you see are not dedicated only to you. They are only used to execute whatever single transaction you requested that resulted in displaying the address.

Very sorry for your loss, OP.
I echo most everyone else's sentiment here in thinking that you will likely find the 12 (or 25) word list before you get into the computer, identify and eventually break into all of the relevant software. The 12 (or 25) words will get you access to everything immediately without any further hacking necessary -- just learning where to enter the words.
The rest of us can take this as yet another reminder to make sure our next of kin can access our balances. My wife can't access the word lists for my Mycelium instance, her Mycelium instance, or my memorized word list for Electrum. My Ledger Nano word list is in our fireproof box, but I should write up simple instructions to go along with it.
On the upside, I occasionally shift my balances from my phone to my Ledger when they get a little too high, so her not having access to Mycelium is not the biggest of deals. Come to think of it, my wife couldn't care less about her balance, so I really should move it to her own wallet on my Nano and then add it to her copy of Mycelium as a watch only HD wallet.
That way she can look at the balances if she ever wants to, but can't spend it without getting on my Nano.

Circle, like most exchanges, is great until it's not. To get to the bottom of the sentiment, you must learn at least a little about Know Your Customer/Anti-Money Laundering (KYC/AML) regulations. Money Services Businesses must go to some pretty great lengths to know how their customers are using Bitcoin. How they're spending it, how they acquired it. They need to make sure the money that you flow through their system wasn't used to "wash" dirty money.
Those regulations dictate that if they believe you are somehow involved in something illegal, they must report the suspicious activity to state and/or federal law enforcement. If they have a strong enough suspicion about your possibly illegal activities, they may go so far as canceling your account without warning, hopefully granting you access to any funds that you had sitting in there. You may not have done anything illegal, either.
Say you bought some BTC from Circle and used it to buy a phone from some guy on Craigslist. Perfectly legal. But the guy on Craigslist turned around and bought some weed from a popular online seller using the BTC you just transferred to him. The way Circle sees it, you could have easily just transferred the BTC to another wallet of yours before buying the weed yourself just to make it look like it wasn't you. All they know is the second transaction after you bought the BTC was to buy from an address of a known darknet market. They can't prove the middle step wasn't you trying to make it look like you didn't buy the weed with the BTC you just bought from Circle, so they close your account and report it. They don't even tell you why they closed it. They can't. That is not them being evil, that is them following the law.
Just know that if you keep your balances online at the big name places, they take law and regulations very seriously and cancel people's accounts all the time around here. Even perfectly innocent people who just bought some BTC to buy a new phone off Craigslist.
When you store your Bitcoin on an app where you alone control the private keys, only then can you feel safe that your balances are protected from seizure. Now, you still have to take cyber security precautions because anyone who hacks you can potentially spend your BTC if they access a device from which you can spend.
Also, if you're in the US, be careful about your recordkeeping unless and until the IRS comes out with new guidance on reporting gains at tax time. If you buy some BTC at a given price, hold onto it for a while and then spend some or all of it when it is worth more than what you paid for it, you are responsible for reporting that to the IRS and paying some percentage of the profit you made in the course of the transaction.
You need to keep track of how much BTC you bought and when, how much it was worth when you bought it (or the exchange rate so you can do the math) and if/when you spend some or all of it, how much BTC you spent and how much that portion was worth when you spent it (again, or the exchange rate at the time so you can do the math again).
You don't want to buy $5 here, $20 there and then spend $10 here and $15 there without keeping track because you likely bought those amounts at different prices and made different profits from each transaction. Every time I purchase BTC, I keep that BTC isolated from others. If you just buy and hold and never spend, none of this applies to you -- but what's the fun in that? I also keep track of how much BTC I spent from each purchase and what it was worth at the time so it is very easy for me to see how much I made (or lost) on that BTC.
Which brings me to one more thing. Totally separate from the recordkeeping you're required to do, it's also a good idea to keep track of everything so that you know how much you're really spending when you spend it. If you paid $100 for some BTC during a price spike and then spent $50 later on after a 50% dip, you just spent $100 for $50 worth of product. By buying BTC at many different prices and keeping them all separate from each other, I have many different price points at which I can spend BTC without making or losing too much money. I know immediately how much cash I'm giving up for the BTC I'm spending and I know if I have to report anything in April because the value went up while I held it.
Imagine earning 100 BTC a day with your computer back in 2009. It wasn't worth any money back then so there was no need to report it to the IRS. 4 years later each BTC was worth $1,100. You're a multi-millionaire in BTC. So to celebrate, you went out and bought a $120,000 Tesla. Guess what? The entire balance you just spent was a long-term capital gain. Your tax bill for next April just went up about $30,000 and your $120,000 Tesla actually cost you $150,000.
Sorry to end on a negative note. Just be cognizant of what you're doing. If you spend $1, make sure you understand how much that $1 actually cost you. And if it didn't cost you anything, then you owe about 25 cents of it to Uncle Sam next April.

If it never left Coinbase then they should have the full records for you to just pull up and review. They are supposed to be one of the easiest to use at tax time.
And yes, I believe most people use First In First Out (FIFO) accounting here. The $900 balance would be the first to provide BTC when you go to sell. You lost $300 in that trade. And you still hold whatever BTC is left from the original amount you bought for $900. The other $400 worth of BTC is untouched until you sell or spend the BTC left over from the original $900 worth that was purchased.
Then, even if you buy more, the $400 purchase is next in line to be spent or sold.
By using FIFO, you can buy a decent amount your first time and keep adding to it but don't spend any for a year. Then you can start spending after a year if the price has gone up from the first purchase. Just make sure you don't spend any coin that you've had less than a year if the price has gone up. That minimizes or eliminates your tax bill.
I don't blend any BTC that was acquired in different purchases. I know the date, price and exchange rate for each purchase and therefore I know if it is up or down in value today and when one year has passed in case the current price is up and the purchase price is never coming back (like $235). They are literally in separate HD wallets so I don't have to keep track of exactly how many bits I can spend before a new cost basis kicks in. Each entire wallet only has one cost basis.

Yup. If someone has attacked the DNS entries for the site, then all traffic destined for the site is instead being redirected to the attacker's site. And if the site looks convincingly enough like the original, people will keep trying to login, giving their credentials to the attackers.
This is one of the many reasons we always say around here _don't use web wallets_. You have absolutely no control over this situation and if what I described is happening again (it's happened before) and you tried to log into a site but failed, you may have just given your credentials to the attackers at the same time that the attackers may have cut off the real site from the rest of the Internet.
Don't use web wallets.
Hopefully, it's not the worst case scenario but if the site does come back and you still have your balances, move them.

(Assuming you mean the first address in an HD wallet -- I'm unaware of a hardware wallet that supports single use addresses, but I could be mistaken) That would be better but they would want to code up a dynamic display that shows a different QR for each donation based on the xpubkey. While you can always receive funds at any address in an HD wallet, you may need to periodically rescan to pick up transactions that are hitting addresses that aren't in the neighborhood of the first unused address.
It is much easier to have just one address to spam all over websites and social media, asking for donations. 
Finally, they also had a meaningful donation address, starting with 1Ross. That, I assume, also contributed to their desire to disseminate it and help people remember why they're doing this. That also makes it easier for multiple people to collect donations in parallel without coordinating their activities.
Imagine if you had a small army of people soliciting donations or placing ads. Would you prefer each person or sticker to show a different address, or would you like for all donors to see the same address (starting with 1Ross) no matter how they answered the call? This is just about the only situation where I'd prefer to have one address reused for accepting donations.
If every sticker showed a different address, I'd be wary of donating to one in the wild. But if the one I found started with 1Ross and when I checked the history has received and swept thousands of donations? Or matches the one shown on their website? I'd definitely have more faith in that one.

The new way they sell BTC. Instead of using the PIN machine, the store uses a laptop to log into the LibertyX website to process the sale. Also, instead of buying a slip of paper with a PIN code written on it, you bring up the LibertyX app on your phone, indicate the address where you want to deposit BTC you're about to buy and then the app displays a PIN code.
You hand over the cash just like before but now you show them the PIN code on your phone. They enter the PIN code on their laptop and the BTC gets transferred to the address you specified. The transfers are still just as quick as they've ever been. The process is just flipped. You give them the PIN instead of them giving it to you.
Still works great, but many of the stores appear to be charging a higher fee under the new system. There are a few 1.5% + $1 stores, but many around me are 9-12% which is nuts.

The scam was including the word list that the new user should use with the device. Just be clear that the buyer should reset the device and make the device generate a new set of words for them. Also, if this is a Ledger device, remind them that it will not boot if someone has altered the firmware. Things kinda got off the rails for a bit there where a whole bunch of newcomers thought it was standard practice to disassemble their Nano and visually inspect the chips. 
If it boots, it is legitimate and they should generate a new set of words.

I assume you're familiar with using hardware wallets to improve the security of mobile apps like Mycelium. You can attach a Nano or Trezor directly to your phone's USB port and still use Mycelium or Greenbits as the interface. This works the same way.

No, I only went with the easiest solution based on your question. You can only do that with a couple of wallets. So if you have it in a mobile wallet like Bread Wallet or Mycelium, you can't choose exactly which UTXOs to spend. You did specify wanting to select a chunk, not necessarily a UTXO.
@_date: 2016-11-11 14:33:40
The apps are programmed with the algorithm that derives keys (and key sequences) from your word list. The apps don't need to store your words anywhere. Using your word list, they generate the master key and then the first few addresses in the first derived HD wallet and store them within app's own storage space. The app will generate more keys and associated addresses from the original master key if you have a large number of transactions. It is up to you to safely store your words somewhere. Then if you need to restore, you enter your words in the same or any compatible app and your wallets, keys and addresses are automatically regenerated. Some wallet apps like Mycelium also support creating multiple HD wallets all derived from the same word list (and therefore master key).
So when you restore on Mycelium, for example, your first HD wallet will reappear automatically. It is up to you to keep adding new HD wallets the same way you always did. When you're restoring, however, all of the previously generated HD wallets will reappear in the same order as you add them, as will all of their transactions and balances. If you have multiple HD wallets and someone steals your phone, make sure you regenerate all of your HD wallets when you're restoring your setup on another device. Just keep regenerating them until you hit a wallet that hasn't been used.
To be extra safe, you should really use two devices -- one for restoring your original word list and wallets and another one to start fresh with a whole new word list. Generate the same number of HD wallets on the new device and transfer all of your balances, one for one, from each legacy HD wallet into the corresponding new one that is replacing it.
Airbitz is different, though, in that one login connects you with all of your HD wallets, yet they do not have access to your words or keys. I'm sure someone else here can describe how that works.

I would be more concerned with buying a cell phone off Craigslist from some tweaker who turns around and buys some meth using the BTC I just gave him for the phone. Next thing you know, the FBI already knew the drug dealer's address and is asking Coinbase for every customer whose BTC eventually landed there. 
In other words, you have to worry about your BTC's future just as much as you think you have to worry about its past.
@_date: 2016-12-30 10:45:14
I believe Mycelium doesn't remind you until you place a balance in the wallet. Once you do, a warning appears in big red letters on every screen that shows a balance that you have not made a backup yet. When you bring up the menu and choose to make a backup, that's when you will write down your words and re-enter them to verify that you wrote them down correctly. 
It will become second nature to you and you will look back on this with less disdain.

Here's the taint analysis. 
Back on December 18th of 2013, you moved 2 BTC into the 1Lp address. You moved them in two different transactions of 1 BTC each within the same minute. Each move was worth $539.
Then, 2 hours later on the same day, you moved 1 BTC out to a 1LVz address. It was worth $556. It went up $20 in 2 hours -- nice rise. Then 15 minutes later, you deposited 28 cents for some reason, maybe to round out the balance to 1 BTC.
Then about 5 weeks later on 1/23/2014 you moved half of the BTC remaining in the 1LpA address worth $409 and then 7 days later you moved the final 0.5 BTC out to 1CETE in the transaction you are trying to remember right now. Think about it -- in a 5 week span, you split up 2 BTC worth $539 and $556 each and then moved half of a BTC worth $409!! The value of BTC rose from $539 to $818 in those five weeks! You may have been splitting up paper wallets to avoid keeping too much balance on any single one.
The source address here (1LpA) is likely a paper wallet or perhaps a Blockchain.info address. You are never supposed to reuse an address once you have sent BTC out of it which is what you did repeatedly here, so you were using an old, deprecated system back then.
What were you doing at the end of 2013 where you moved 2 BTC onto a paper wallet (in two transactions of 1 BTC at the same moment) and then moved 1 of the two BTC out 2 hours later? Then you added 28 cents a few minutes after that?? Then five weeks later in late January, you sent half a BTC to one address and a week later sent the final half of the original 2 BTC to the address you're now asking about.
Why are you loading and spending repeatedly from the same address? You are not supposed to do that. If you had used just about any software, you would have different addresses for each transaction. At least the 1LpA address is now empty so maybe you were moving your balances into an HD wallet.
Now that I have reminded you of your transactions, do you remember why you put 2 BTC in a paper wallet and then took one of the two out just 2 hours later? And then added 28 cents immediately after that? Think and it may come back to you. The final transaction that you are asking about right now was worth $400.08 at the time.
I looked at the first BTC you moved out 2 hours after depositing the first 2 BTC into the 1LpA address. 20 minutes after depositing the BTC, there was a transaction that emptied the balance but it looks like that was using an HD wallet. 0.4 BTC went to one address and 0.59 went to another one. The .40 BTC address is interesting. Blockchain is showing that you deposited .407 BTC for $227 and then somehow sent .48 BTC split across two different addresses. One for $9.66 and one for $267. Doesn't make sense that Blockchain would say you deposited .407 BTC and withdrew .48 BTC just 20 minutes later. That's supposed to be impossible. You were very busy on 12/18/2013.
Did you start splitting up your balances across HD wallets at the end of 2013 to try them out? Bread Wallet? Mycelium? You kept reusing a single address early on but it looks like you eventually moved the balances to an HD wallet.
Hope this jogs your memory.
If you use Android, go to Google Maps on a PC browser, bring up the side menu and click "Your Timeline". Go back to December 18th, 2013 and see where you were. Maybe you were visiting a friend and showing them how Bitcoin works by moving some balances around. Maybe the 1 BTC transfer you made 2 hours after depositing 2 BTC was to sell him BTC? It was a Wednesday. I went to Cheeburger Cheeburger for lunch and then for some reason dropped by my in-laws. No idea why.

Are you sure you can't cancel a recurring ad and ask for any remaining funds to be returned? Understanding what customers went through to learn about Bitcoin, I can totally see them only wanting to go through this say once a year. 
We all know that simply accepting payment for goods and services in Bitcoin is not enough to require a Bitlicense. They're not selling BTC, so that leaves holding customer BTC balances as one of the few qualifying use cases. Any other ideas?

People who want to buy Bitcoin for the purpose of trading it like a foreign currency.
That's why exchanges were all the talk this week. They exchange fiat for crypto or one kind of crypto for another. They also hold balances on behalf of customers, and that is what made NYDFS ask, "Wait, say what?"
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:49:05
So you want to do work for and get paid by this business in crypto and you want them to accept Bitcoin as payment from their customers?
My first thought is that Coinbase and BitPay both allow businesses to accept Bitcoin. They also allow the business to decide how much of the crypto payments they want to receive in crypto vs fiat. So, for instance, they could choose to receive enough of the payments as crypto to cover your salary and the rest in fiat to keep it simple.
Another on-ramp is for you to use BitWage to manage how you invoice them. It's great that you're working to drive adoption on "the front side" of the business, but you are also free to make unilateral changes on your side and use that as a demo to the business.
With the current variability in price, I'm not sure this is a good time to push a business to start adopting crypto.
Either way, BitPay has always been a leader in helping businesses accept crypto and BitWage has been a leader in helping workers get paid in crypto.

Bitlicense applies to exchanges and businesses that hold balances on behalf of users, but does the escrow service actually take control if they're 1-of-3? They can't send balances anywhere without approval and cooperation by one of the two other parties. All they can do is prevent the sending of balances.

The blockchain.info wallet used to chime whenever you received a payment. I don't know if they do HD wallets yet but if so, you may wish to load up yours as a WATCH ONLY wallet. Don't use it as a wallet with private keys.

I like to see what winners do with their BTC. I smile when its clear that someone "gets it". The 6th winner published three different addresses early on in the payout cycle, but he eventually got his mind wrapped around what he was doing, swept his ChangeTip into his final winning address and then swept it all away (or sold it). He got it. Pretty much all the others still have balances in their published winning addresses. Some have swept but eventually stopped checking. It seems others never even looked.
I also got played for a buck by someone who claimed to not know what she was doing. Someone gave her $1.20 to play with but she derped out and loaded Core. I got her to load Electrum and gave her a buck for that. She swore she was going to donate it to the next winner -- four winners ago. It's still sitting right where I sent it. Checking her Reddit history and all she did for a long time was beg in FairShare.
I also like to watch goofy stunts like the guy stapling the free bitcoin to the telephone pole or on the corkboard in the bar. Or stuffed in a brick when building a house. It's fun watching people throw in a few bits (or more) from around the world. Just a reminder of the kinds of things you can do.
So yeah, I have a bunch of watch only addresses up in Mycelium.

Oh I got that. That's why I asked if you checked to see how many transactions have sent payments to that address. That's something I would do to gauge how much Bitcoin business they do.

It also applies to entities that offer to hold balances on behalf of customers. They must prove that they are being responsible custodians of those balances. It sounds like customers can fund an account that is then used to pay for recurring ads. If you are storing other people's money, you are acting as a bank.

Ledger (for now) only needs to have its initial prep done on a clean computer. After that it can be used on any system with a Chrome browser and mobile devices as the app compatibility gets finalized.
Clean means booted from media such as a Chromium installer or live Ubuntu CD. AFAIK, they are making the devices bootable, thus providing the clean system you need for configuring the device the first time.

I've been wondering how long this was going to succeed. Someone posts here frequently and very prominently declaring that they sell BTC exactly the way you describe but declare very clearly that they never check ID. They have accounts with multiple major banks nationwide. I obviously don't know what kind of AML/KYC your seller has been following, but there's one in particular who very clearly states they never check. Your seller may have recently or soon may be arrested.
@_date: 2015-08-13 00:40:22
Yes you may send and receive BTC to either wallet and you may generate even more wallets. Since you're never really supposed to use the same address more than once, the system identifies a sequence of millions of addresses to use, one after the other in a specific sequence. The number of private keys that are associated with a given wallet indicate the number of transactions you've performed with that wallet. The "useless" keys are actually just "used" keys. 
Because of the fact that you're supposed to keep track of how much your BTC increased or decreased in value between the time you acquired it and sold or spent it, I make a new a wallet every time I buy BTC and name it with the rate I paid. I also include the rate when I name each transaction to make it extremely easy to figure out how much it went up or down in value while I held it.

Good start. Also, wallets don't hold "Bitcoins". They hold private keys that allow you to transfer BTC out to other Bitcoin addresses.
One of the main points to all this is that everyone agrees how much BTC is allocated to each address, not how much BTC is stored in a given address.

Did you try restoring to software? I would think that would also help a great deal. If someone steals or you accidentally destroy your device, you can get up and running again using your seed on compatible software titles. 
For me, I personally went with a Ledger Nano because it is an entirely different way to solve the same problem in the same general way (offline key storage and transaction signing with 2FA). The main difference is they use a proprietary chip like those that have been protecting bank cards all over the planet for nearly 2 decades. The data protection features are unbeatable. For a short time there, it was possible to steal keys from a Trezor by monitoring signals leaking from the USB cable. There is no USB cable for the Ledger devices. You literally plug a bank card smart chip directly into the USB port. 
The fact that Trezor needs to beef up their packaging actually highlights an issue with their design, not a benefit. The Ledger products on the other hand won't start if the firmware has been updated to an unofficial version. You can't carry your Trezor on your keychain the way I carry my Nano, so if you're under investigation and someone secretly swaps out the firmware on your Trezor while you're out you would never know. Even if it needs to be reinitialized, I'd bet a number of people would just shrug their shoulders, say, "Huh. That's weird." and go right ahead and reinitialize their device.
I'm a 20+ year Linux guy and even walk around in a Free Software Free Society shirt. Unfortunately(?), I have to side with the proprietary guys on this one. They appear to have a solid grip on security and sell great products for 1/3rd or 1/4th the price of the products sold by the guys who seem to be learning this stuff. Not necessarily fintech, but the concepts of security, embedded software and even Open Source principles.

If you're in the US, LibertyX would get you close. I became fully verified in less than 10 minutes, and that unlocked $1,000/day buying limit. That's 3.9 BTC right there. Cash only, available at thousands of retail stores nationwide, immediate transfers.
@_date: 2015-08-10 22:41:44
Go to libertyx.com/locations to see if any stores are near you. They are usually check cashing places and need to be on the QPay or ACE networks.
If you go to a QPay store, tell them you want to pay a bill to LibertyX. They will ask how much you want to pay up to $1,000/day or $2,500/week in denominations of $50, $100, $200 or $300. Pay them and they will hand you a receipt with a PIN code on it. Go to libertyx.com/store and click Redeem a PIN. Flip over to your wallet, copy your current deposit address to the clipboard, flip back to the browser, enter the PIN code and paste in your Bitcoin address. The transfer usually starts before I leave the store.
I haven't used a store on the ACE network, but I believe they'll ask you for your account number and the exact amount you want to pay -- any amount. Give them the mobile number you used to register. I believe you'll get a text message asking for your Bitcoin deposit address. Reply with your current deposit address and the transfer should again start immediately.
0% for the first $1,000, 1% after that. Up to $1,000/day or $2,500/wk with easy KYC. It's the way to go if you want a clean, commercial Bitcoin buying experience that leads to surprisingly few complaints around here.

With the understanding that the seller, not the buyer, is breaking federal law by selling BTC to the buyer if they are not licensed. 
I know it is silly, but every single seller around the world should be asking the buyer to present ID if for no other reason than to satisfy themselves that the buyer is not from New York. 
Buying face to face in Paris? Yup. The seller should ask for proof that the buyer is not from New York. There is no place on earth a resident of New York can go to legally buy BTC from an unlicensed seller. Period. 
It's not the location of the seller that determines the requirement to be licensed - it's the residence of the buyer. He is F'ed from a legal perspective.

I've had two successful buys in four tries. First time the store had left the QPay Network a year before but no one told LibertyX. Second time was perfect.

So I drove down the street to another location that was more than happy to sell me some BTC.

I agree that they're more than a bit out of touch with the entrepreneur community, but there is something to be said for responsibly holding onto other people's money. I'm of the opinion that there are thousands of products and services that can be developed that don't require the business to hold onto customers' balances -- and none of them require Bitlicense.
It's one thing to wake up one day and say, "I'm going to disrupt the taxi industry! There's no reason for all those regulations to exist, fuck old people!" and it's something entirely different to be MagicalTux. Now when you want to hold onto half a billion dollars' worth of other people's money on some paper wallets, I would hope you (not YOU, of course) wouldn't just run around in circles yelling "disrupt! pivot! disrupt! buzzword!"
That's getting closer to the spirit of this thing.

That's cool. I read the first option as "buy and spend" or "use it like money". I read the second option as "buy and hold" or "use it like an investment". Sure, investing could include trading. That's just now how I read it at first. Notice also that these are types of consumers that are listed, not merchants.
If you're a consumer who wants to buy and spend or buy and hold or buy and trade, you're exempt. If you're a merchant who accepts digital currencies as payments for your goods and services (coffee shops and massage parlors), you're exempt. If you want to facilitate the exchange of value between different types of liquid assets, you just became a money transmitter. If you want to hold other people's money for them on their behalf, you just became a money services business.
Consumers are exempt from applying for the license. Money transmitters and money services businesses are not.

BitLicense made it illegal for anyone to sell to or store crypto balances on behalf of any residents New York without accreditation that you're capable of managing other peoples' money. Not people located in New York. Residents of New York. To this day, it is illegal for someone on Earth to sell crypto to, even face to face, or offer to store crypto for a resident of New York unless that seller is properly accredited. Anyone with a banking license does not need to pursue a BitLicense. Coinbase went out and got accredited. It's a pretty big deal. 
ChangeTip either needed to filter out residents of New York, get accredited, or liquidate. I believe North Carolina and the State of Washington have since followed suit with similar laws.
It was a nice little tip jar. Rendered illegal by the home state of America's banking industry and a global financial center. This is my shocked face. :-| Residents can't even leave the state to get legal. It is literally illegal to service them unless you qualify. This was done in the wake of MtGox.

0% for the first $1,000 of BTC purchased over your lifetime. 1% after that. Max $1,000/day and $2,500/week for fully verified customers. I entered my driver's license details and linked my cell phone and was verified in less than 10 minutes.
Also, the fixed price PINs are at stores on the QPay Network. ACE Express stores are totally flexible. You specify the exact amount you wish to purchase.

"Have any of [us] ever actually bought anything with Bitcoin?"
Yes. I bought coffee at a little shop on Tampa's Bitcoin Blvd a couple weeks after the Bitcoin Bowl college football game. I also paid for a dinner at the Clevelander during the North American Bitcoin Conference back in January. 
Both use cases were a little slower than credit cards by a few seconds, but the safety concerns are nonexistent. Both establishments used BitPay - one on an iPad, the other on what looked like a Samsung Galaxy S6, or 5 if the 6 wasn't out yet.

You have to tell the router the address at which you are running Core and tell the router exactly what kind of incoming connection requests to forward to the PC where Core is running. 
That's why I brought it up. Unless Core tells routers how to process incoming connection requests (which is a very bad practice from a security perspective), then the instructions you gave are incomplete and are hurting Bitcoin, not helping. 
There's more to it than just installing Core. It's not difficult for technical people to do, but you left it out, that's all.

First and foremost, make sure you are creating a new address for each transaction. That way you don't have to struggle to sort through your payments to see how much was paid to you for a given transaction. You can do this by using an HD wallet.
Even better would be to create a new HD wallet for each client or customer who signs up. Especially if you expect them to make several purchases from you. 
No matter which method you choose, you want to arrive at a 1:1 ratio of invoice number to Bitcoin address. Then it becomes a very simple task to make sure the balance transferred into the address matches the total shown on the corresponding invoice.

Yes. This is only for businesses setup to exchange ~~USD for crypto~~ any two currencies (fiat or crypto) or for businesses that hold balances on behalf of users. This does not apply to selling goods and services for BTC, both at the personal level and the commercial level. Coffee shops that accept Bitcoin for payment are still perfectly able to do so. 
Even startups that are developing a new wallet or other Bitcoin related apps don't need to apply so long as the parent company doesn't hold customer funds on behalf of the customer. If you want to be a bank, it takes responsibility, and Bitlicense was designed to force you to prove you're ready for that responsibility.

It's the fact that they're trying to do business inside the State of New York that brings it under their jurisdiction. That's why the short answer is to block New Yorkers and call it a day. It's a bit of a stretch to me that every face-to-face seller worldwide needs to make sure they're not getting caught in a sting selling to a New Yorker, but if they offer a web site to residents of New York, they are doing business in New York. Maybe that helps.

We haven't heard stories about Circle shutting down accounts without warning because users' BTC eventually ended up at shady sites the way we have about Coinbase, for instance.
In addition, you may wish to check out LibertyX.com. Click on Locations and see if any stores are available nearby. They don't hold Bitcoin for you on their website or app, so it would help if you spend a little time with a wallet app, such as Mycelium on Android or Breadwallet on iOS. Learn how to identify your "Receive" address and copy it to the clipboard.
When you get to the store, there are two different ways to identify that you want to pay LibertyX, depending on which type of store it is. The approaches are outlined on the site. Whichever way you choose, you should end up with BTC being transferred into your wallet before you leave the store.
Only the app on your phone will likely be able to spend the money in your wallet, so make sure you follow the prescribed steps to back up your wallet data. 
Once your phone wallet shows a balance ready to spend, you should have by problem paying the bill at nfl2go.

Even upon rereading my comment, there are 100 million satoshis _per BTC_. Not 100 million total. 1 satoshi will equal 1 cent if/when BTC is worth $1 million. So there will ultimately be 100 million satoshis x 21 million BTC, not just 100 million as I mistakenly said. And in case you're thinking that it will be a long way before the final satoshis will be mined, it will take 55 years to mine the last 10 BTC. The rate at which new satoshis are being created is about to get noticeably slower in the next 10 years.

Ledger Live is installed on a PC/laptop and mobile. You only install a small bit of code on the Nano S for each coin you want to use with the Nano S. If you remember adding support for each coin on the Nano S that part has not changed. How you interact with the Nano S on your PC/laptop/phone has changed, however.
With the latest firmware, you can't install support for too many coins at once on the Nano S, that's why it is valuable that Ledger Live keeps track of all your total balances across all of your coins at all times. You can fire up the Ledger Live app on your phone to check your balances without risking any of your balances since you can't send anything (no one can steal anything from you) without you physically attaching the Nano S and authorizing the transaction.

Bitlicense is needed by any business worldwide that wants to hold onto BTC for anyone residing in the State of New York (which includes New York City). That's the only aspect of the business model that triggers this requirement. 
You take on a lot of responsibility when you plan to hold onto other people's money and promise that it will be there when they try to withdraw their balances. Bitlicense was designed to tell businesses how to behave when holding customers' money. If you want to be a crypto bank for New Yorkers, well, there's actually a lot that goes into being a bank.
If you don't want to do all that stuff, don't offer your services to residents of New York. Businesses are now cutting off New Yorkers due to what is being demanded of them in the name of consumer protection. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 09:45:34
That's a tough call. You have to make the decision as to what (if anything) to sell. I sold my BCH at the first opportunity at $265. It tripled in price after that and has since settled down to double that price. 
You should see both coins in your Nano S and won't be forced to sell anything. I'm not going to rush into dumping either coin like I did last time. 
@_date: 2015-07-24 10:06:41
The primary goal of Bitlicense is to ensure that companies that bring bank like features to Bitcoin follow the same practices that banks do. If the company holds money for customers and shows IOUs as a customer balance screen, then the company needs to have a certain amount in reserve. The business needs to prove how they plan to track everyone's money and properly report balances. Also, reserve balances must be held in local currency to protect against loss. 
Basically it is designed to protect against everything that went wrong at Gox. And it applies to any business worldwide that offers these services to residents and businesses located in New York State. If you are running a business that holds BTC for customers and controls the private keys on their behalf, like Coinbase and ChangeTip, then you either need to apply for a Bitlicense or block everyone who could possibly be a resident or a business operating in the State of New York.
Businesses that buy or sell goods in BTC do not need a Bitlicense. Developers who have published a wallet but don't actually hold any of their customers' funds don't need a Bitlicense. It's only if you hold a customer's balance and show them an IOU when they check their balance.
You cannot move to get away from it. You have to cut off every resident and business in the state to get away from it. 
I suggest you do some more reading on it and watch Lawsky's talk from the day of the final release.

Ah. Looking at your graphic, I assumed you only bought one. Did you click back and purchase a second one? And if so, did the browser just show the cached version of the page, including the address? I'm also surprised they knew to sweep the balance from your second payment and apply it to your (second?) order. Or did you change the count to two after the screengrab and somehow get asked to make two separate payments to the same address? Sorry to dig, but this is very intriguing. How did it go down?
It looks like they don't reuse addresses since the only purchases at that address are yours, but then again they may reuse that one address and yours could also have been the only two purchases paid with Bitcoin.

That's correct. You're the one NY is trying to protect by not allowing you to transact with just anyone who woke up one day and decided they wanted to be a new kind of bank. There's no place on Earth you can go to escape the requirement that anyone who wants to sell you BTC must be licensed to do so. Imagine buying some F2F in a French cafe, and the seller asks to see your driver's license because he "has to make sure you're not from New York"? That is _literally_ what is supposed to be happening with every BTC sale worldwide now. LOL, I know.
Coinbase has said they're filing, so you're not completely screwed. On the upside, anyone you buy from who is licensed has almost a zero chance of becoming the next MTGOX.

All of the wallets exist under the same seed word list. Should you lose or destroy your device, you'll only need to enter your seed list once when restoring on a new device. As you add new HD wallets on the new device, all of the wallets you defined before will come back, including all of the transactions that have occurred within those individual wallets. It's actually pretty cool. 
The only thing that does not come back are your labels. Any names that you've applied to the wallet or the individual transactions will not come back at this point. They are working on that feature, however. 
If you search for Mycelium restore here, you will find a number of people who panicked after restoring only to find one HD wallet become relieved when all of their wallets came back, just by adding a new wallet on the Accounts tab.

If it's just the commercial experience you're looking for, I buy from LibertyX in the US. Sure you register online, but that takes two minutes. Then you go to any of thousands of stores across the country, put down cash in multiples of $50 and get a receipt printed. Log into the website again from your phone, enter a unique serial number off your receipt and give them the Bitcoin address where you want the BTC deposited.
The transfer usually starts before I leave the store counter, let alone the store. No dark alleys or eyeing a safe corner in a coffee shop. No mailing in pictures of you holding your license. Oh, and 0% fee for the first $1,000. 1% fee after that. Max purchase $2,500/week.

Bitlicense has nothing to do with where the business is located. It applies to all businesses worldwide who want to offer their services to residents of the State of New York. It also only applies if you want to hold funds on behalf of your users.
If you want to offer a web wallet or store funds on behalf of your customers, you either go through a rigorous, expensive process designed to protect against accidental or fraudulent loss of customer funds and get a Bitlicense or block access to residents of New York and call it a day. That's why they're offering to help New York residents withdraw their balances.

Sounds good, I'll have to bookmark it in Google Maps to remind myself to check it out sometime. 
As for the payment approach, this sounds perfect for the "restaurant just getting started" approach I've described in the past:
* Place a Piper printer near the register.
* Print a new wallet whenever a customer asks to pay in Bitcoin
* Tear the wallet in half and staple the payment address to the customer's bill
* Have customer send BTC to the address shown
* Drop the private key in a lockbox
* Open the lockbox at the end of the day and integrate the payments into their books. 
Or just sign up at BitPay, flash a QR and wait a day or two for the USD to hit their bank account if that's what they prefer. 
Flashing the same QR to anyone who asks is not optimal. Did you check the address you paid to see how many transactions they've processed? I'm guessing not too many. But still, at least they do it and they have some sort of process.

Can't each transaction handle hundreds of inputs and outputs? Not that anyone does it that way (yet), but IIUC it's possible. A single transaction can move huge amounts in many directions at once. The more centralized transactions become within Coinbase and BitPay the easier it will be for them to process transactions off chain and with fewer on chain transactions containing higher numbers of inputs and outputs. Also think of Bitwage on 15th and 30th. They could probably pay all of their users with one on chain transaction each payday if they put their minds to it.

Don't think of it as so much a wallet for each transaction but a single (use) address. I understand why people around here say that every time you reuse an address you hurt EVERYONE'S privacy. I don't necessarily preach that, but I get it. 
This is a different use case to me. I'm not coming at it from the angle of tying in addresses from around the world to a BBQ joint in Central Pennsylvania. I'm thinking of it from an accounting perspective. By stapling a unique deposit address to each bill, it is extremely easy to verify that the bill was paid and fully confirmed. Also, consider tips. If you reused a single address throughout the day (and people are assumed to be good), then no Bitcoin payments sent to that single address will match a bill from that day. How do you identify any bills that were short paid, and how do you identify tips for the server or the team? If you scale up the transaction volume in the future, that sounds like a nightmare to me. 
That's why I suggest using one address per bill. There will always be one deposit and one withdrawal. The amount can be compared to the amount on the bill with which it was associated and you can easily spot any anomalies or tips beyond the amount requested. 
That's also why I like the Piper so much for that situation. It's one of the safest and quickest ways to make a paper wallet. Push a button and a few seconds later a new wallet is printed on the receipt paper the business is already accustomed to handling. Believe me, I'm not suggesting some convoluted system of making a new address for each bill and I totally get it if that's what you were thinking. Watch some videos with the Piper if you haven't seen it yet, and maybe my suggestion won't seem so over the top. Thanks for asking!

If you want to take it slowly with them, tell them they can get a discount if they pay with a receipt from LibertyX. They don't even need to open an account, just go to a store, pay cash and give you the receipt. 
Go to  and enter "kcy". There are numerous locations throughout the area. Better contact support before doing that, though, to find out how they handle expired PINs as I doubt anyone using your services will buy the PIN on the same day they pay you. At worst, I hope they would just recalculate the exchange based on current rates or honor the rate at the end of the 24 period. They don't seem like the kind of people to abscond with your money. 
Seriously, though. "$100 off if you pay with a LibertyX money order available at these stores." Your clients don't actually have to get into Bitcoin to pay you in Bitcoin.

I also wonder about coffee shops that give change in BTC. Buy a cup of coffee for $2. Pay $100 USD and ask for $98 back in BTC. That might be a bit too obvious :) What about refunds? It's not just coffee shops that are exempt. It is almost all kinds of merchants. Bike shops, too. Or can you only get refunds in the same type of currency you paid?
Suppose I want to sell someone $1,000 worth of BTC but I'm not licensed. I could buy a bike for $1,000 worth of BTC, sell it to someone else for USD and have them return it for BTC because the bike shop only refunds in the same currency. Now who's laundering money? Imagine the confused look on the shop owner's face if that goes down right in front of them. Even if they only issue refunds in BTC to the address that paid them, there's nothing stopping you from paying them from a paper wallet using Mycelium. Make a paper wallet. Load it with $1,000 worth of BTC. Buy the bike, paying from that address. Sell the empty paper wallet and the bike for $1,000. Buyer returns the bike and the store refunds the $1,000 worth of BTC (less a restocking fee, I'm sure) to the address that initially paid for the bike. Done.
I think Newegg only refunds in cash, probably to avoid exactly this.

I started studying it back in Nov '13 at the peak. Luckily I sat on the sidelines long enough to watch the MTGOX collapse. That gave me enough time to study the underpinnings and read a LOT about it. I was actually reading alt.cypherpunks back in the early 90s but had gone corporate soon after and got out of that life. When I learned that all of this came from that community, I was blown away seeing these abstract concepts had come to life. I've been a technologist for a very long time and an old cipher geek so this stuff came to me very quickly. I have a deep appreciation for how Satoshi solved a wide variety of very real problems and still enjoy reading Nick Szabo's library. So much great stuff in there.
Separately, having worked low level jobs in finance, I knew that there was no such thing as free money, and that there were going to be tax implications for how Bitcoin is being used. Sure enough, I watched the Senate hearings, the NYDFS panel and read the FinCEN notices and IRS guidance and I knew this is simply not just cash that can gain or lose value while it sits in your pocket. Once the dust settled and I developed a strategy for when to buy, how much to buy, what I would actually do with it and how to meet recordkeeping requirements, I finally bought for the first time in January of this year. I keep each purchase in a separate HD wallet so that I know exactly how much I paid for each tranche and I tag each transaction with how much it was worth when I spent or sold it. I only spend if I'm making less than 50c in capital gains on the transaction. Spending at close to the purchase price is always preferred,  but I've had to spend some that was way down from purchase.
I think some people tend to lose sight of how much you're spending to convert your cash into BTC and sometimes back again when making a purchase. I'm still below $1,000 at LibertyX so I'm still paying Bitstamp +0%. I once bought via Google Wallet just to try it out with this seller and paid 15%. Ouch.
What gets me is the fold app. Do people realize that in the US you're supposed to keep track of the exchange rate and date of purchase and the exchange rate and date of sale of all your BTC so that you can calculate how much value your BTC gained or lost while you held it? If all my purchases were in the form of 99c or less worth of BTC every time I swiped my card, I would be in an accounting nightmare. Capturing the exchange rate and purchase date for each transaction isn't even the hard or annoying part. Say I go to buy something worth $500 off Craigslist and pay in BTC. At tax time, I need to sit down with every single fold transaction (all less than a dollar, right?) and figure out which 600 or so BTC purchases contributed to the $500 payment I just made. For each and every one, I need to figure out how much each BTC purchase went up or down in value while I held it. Then, after canceling out the gains with losses in the table, I need to look for those that went up more than 50c while I held them and I need to write another check for 42% of the total gained. Holy crap, what a nightmare. And forget about the price fluctuations! Sure, its dollar cost averaging but I may be averaging purchase prices between $200 and $300! That $500 purchase may have actually cost me $575 during a long, slow decline. If I must pay that much for something in BTC, I will go to a LibertyX to buy it and spend it in the same day and get it all in one big tranche at one price. I'm convinced everyone just ignores that and treats it like cash.
I could never use fold unless they made accounting a dream. is adding an Export to CSV to Mycelium at my request specifically to address this. Whenever I buy, I create a new HD wallet in Mycelium, tag it with the current date + 1 year and the exchange rate. I walk into a LibertyX, plunk down $50 cash and get a receipt. I go into the "Receive" view for the new HD wallet and copy the Bitcoin address to the clipboard. I go to the browser, bring up LibertyX, click Redeem a PIN, enter the PIN code on the receipt and paste in my Bitcoin address. I switch back to Mycelium, see that the transfer for the full $50 has started and go about my day. I do NOT blend BTC purchases from different dates and exchange rates in the same HD wallet. If I do, that blows up my system.
When I go to spend, I look for a wallet that has enough balance to cover the intended purchase and was bought at or slightly above the current exchange rate. By spending at or below the purchase price, I avoid spending "free money". That's what gets you into trouble if you're not careful. has been an awesome resource in here for a long time.
OTOH I don't get to spend all that often. Usually just the monthly drawing in I use it more as a showcase for some of the capabilities of crypto vs hoping to win a few thousand dollars. For each drawing, I grab a legacy address at bitaddress and import it into Mycelium. Then I move $1 (that is safe to spend!) into it and cryptographically sign a text message using the corresponding private key. I then post that text message with the signing data around it as my entry in the contest. Doing it that way guarantees that anyone can verify that the address has $1 in it before the drawing is held and that the redditor who claims to be me inside and outside the signed content also has the private key to that address. The IRS will accept one average price to use on a given day. So if I ever win and donations start arriving on the legacy address, I will have to create a new HD wallet for each day and transfer the winnings that arrived that day into the appropriate wallet. Same for ChangeTip donations. I always watch winners' crypto wallets to see if they ever add their ChangeTip winnings or move their overall winnings to another wallet for safekeeping and management. The 5th and 6th have done it and the 7th is trying to keep up, sweeping new donations every so often. The 4th one has never moved their winnings and probably still has no idea that they have over $3,000 still sitting in their wallet.
Sorry for the book. tl;dr I'm an old geek who grew up in the community where Bitcoin was born; I watched for over a year before making my first purchase this year and I can prove I break even or lose a little money every time I use BTC. I have loved the crypto technology behind it for over 20 years and I look forward to the day when I can step off an airplane in any country and buy a cup of coffee with BTC. Maybe even a house.

In the US, LibertyX offers 0% fees on the first $1,000, 1% after that. $1,000/day and $2,500/week maximum purchase. Available at thousands of retail locations nationwide. They will give you an extra $5 if you're the first customer at a location. When you buy the minimum $50, you'll get $55 in BTC. 
Cash only transactions. Transfers start immediately and go directly to any address you specify, which should be a real wallet that you control, not a web wallet that shows IOUs.

Thanks for reading and thanks for the welcome, I'm glad you opened this thread.
I find it easier to think of Bitcoin from the IRS perspective as investing in investment grade art. You buy it,  hope it goes up, and sell it maybe hoping to buy a boat or a house on the Riviera. That gain in value is not free money. They always want their share. Just by following the steps I outlined such as setting up a new HD wallet for each purchase named for the rate and labeling each purchase within each wallet with the reason, value in USD and exchange rate at the time that can make things much easier in terms of recordkeeping. Collecting hundreds or thousands of tiny BTC purchases into one HD wallet really can be nightmarish.
I've also considered using Bitwage, but the same thing applies -- I would end up making a new wallet every two weeks named with the exchange rate and purchase date just to keep the recordkeeping straight. Even if I swept the balance coming into my receiving address after each paycheck arrived, I still wouldn't be too hot on having one address show every paycheck coming in and getting swept out. I would rather give Bitwage a master public key to a Mycelium HD wallet and then have them transfer each BTC purchase into a new address every two weeks. Until they implement that, anyone can monitor my paychecks as they come and go through one public address. And I'd still have to move each payment to another HD wallet to keep the tranches apart. Ick.

Once you install support for each coin on your Nano S using Ledger Live, you'll detect all of the wallets established for that coin. Ledger Live will remember all of the accounts (wallets) associated with each coin. Keep in mind that you can only install the supporting app for a few coins on the Nano S at once. But once you install support for each coin and detect the wallets you've been storing for those coins on the device, you can then uninstall the support for that coin from the device. The wallets for each coin remains in Ledger Live even after you uninstall the supporting app from the Nano S. You need to have the supporting app installed on the Nano S for any coin you want to send.
So again, once you install the app for each coin and register each wallet for each coin in Ledger Live you can then uninstall it from the Nano S to make room, but Ledger Live will always show you the current value for every wallet and coin you detected all along the way.
If you only have one coin and one wallet on your Nano S, then none of this matters to you. If you didn't realize you could store multiple wallets for each of multiple coins (dozens?) perhaps this has piqued your interest.

They've never asked me for ID at the stores. Only online at signup. At the store, they couldn't care less. I give them cash, they give me a receipt. There's no mechanism at the store for them to check your ID for verification. At least there wasn't when I bought there. You tell them you want to pay LibertyX on the QPay Network. They ask how much in $50 amounts. You pay cash and they give you a receipt. Of course you can't cash in the PIN code unless and until you sign up and sign in. So if you're having trouble establishing an account then you won't be able to convert the PIN into BTC. That's not a function of the store, though.

I have entered (and paid!) since about the fourth drawing. I like to use it to showcase Bitcoin's capabilities. I use Mycelium to digitally sign my entry comment. That way, anyone can verify that someone claiming to be me controls an address that has $1 in it BEFORE the drawing, ready to be donated to the winner if it's not me. Of course if I do win, the public address is listed in my entry, so there's no need to wait for my Thank You note. I'll wake up on Sunday to an address that has a lot more than $1 in it!
It's really the best place I've seen where crypto is part of normal everyday conversations. Between BTC, ChangeTip, LTC and Doge, chances are you'll find someone donating to each other and to the winner.

What priority have you set for the transfer? Are you sure you have the correct wallet selected for the transfer you are trying to initiate? Are you trying to send the entire balance of that particular wallet? If so, what happens when you hit Max for the amount to send? Or did you load it up before a big drop and expect the entire balance to still be in there?

This. Five minutes to sign up. Transfers start within seconds after you complete the purchase and go to a real wallet you specify and control. Available at thousands of commercial retailers across the country. 
No fee on the first $1,000. 1% after that. $1,000/day and $2,500/week limit. Excellent choice.

Last two times I bought cars.
Once the seller and I walked into a branch of the bank we both used. I told the teller how much to transfer from my account to his. Done. Signed the paperwork and we drove two minutes to a shop to change the registration to my name. 
Second time, my wife and I drove both my cars to a dealership. They gave me credit for both my cars, I wrote a personal check for the difference between the two credits and my new car cost. He called my insurance company for me and they asked me to verify the changes. I took a loaner home while they prepped the new car overnight. Went back the next morning and took my new car home. 
That's how it normally goes in the US. Way less complicated. Next time will be to buy a Tesla CPO, give my wife my car and give her car to my sister :)

The rules only apply if a crypto firm wants to store balances on behalf of their customers. I understand that LBC offers web wallets to users in order to provide speedier transactions. If that's the case, then, yes. 
Businesses can do whatever they please in the crypto space, but when it comes to storing other people's money, that ramps up the responsibility and care that must be taken to protect those balances from accidental or fraudulent loss.

I normally fly about 40 weeks a year, but this year I haven't flown that much. My last flight was two days before I got the S, so I haven't had a chance to take it on a plane yet. It'll be fine. We would have known by now if they get fried by TSA. I've taken the original Nano on dozens of flights and never had a problem.

Thank you for this. I'm not sure I could give what you describe to Bitwage as a standing order on how to break up my paychecks, though. This looks great for one off payments or for automated requests, say on charity donation pages, but I would want a set it and forget it mentality when it comes to my paycheck.
1. Create a new HD wallet, preferably in Mycelium
1. Export the master public key for that new wallet (assuming that feature exists or is coming)
1. Sign up at Bitwage and provide the key at signup
1. Add the Bitwage routing number and account number to my Direct Deposit and specify a fixed amount to divert
1. Every two weeks, pull up the wallet in Mycelium and make sure the payments are still coming in on schedule
1. Rest easy knowing that each payment is arriving on a different address within the same HD wallet
1. Move each paycheck to a new HD wallet named for the date of purchase and exchange rate of the date so that I can choose which cost basis I want to use when spending

Sure you can. From anyone who has a Bitlicense. The regulation applies to anyone who wants to sell YOU Bitcoin no matter where in the world they are located.
@_date: 2015-08-17 23:21:04
It's not about the bank checking ID. The person selling you BTC is the one who is supposed to keep records about you and your activities. Sorry I didn't make that clear. Your post never mentioned that they were able to find the correct address, nor that you were eventually able to make the deposit -- only that your deposit was the only one the seller said was having problems.
It may not be as bad as I originally read your post, but unless the person selling you BTC keeps records on their buyers, there is a real risk it may go away one day.

Practice installing and deleting coin support apps from the Nano S using Ledger Live. If you have a wide variety of holdings, you're going to be doing that a lot. What's nice is that the Ledger Live app will show all of your holdings (for supported coins) regardless of whether or not the associated app is currently installed on your Nano S. Then it is also interesting importing all of your wallets into Ledger Live Mobile at once. Much better experience than how it was previously.

Interesting. A couple of QPay sites I've either used or mapped out earlier this year are still there. They may have also cleaned up some cruft as I once had to remove a location that "dropped QPay a year ago".
Maybe they found a more updated location database.

Whenever we're driving through shady areas with a Boost Mobile store, she always comments, "I bet you can buy Bitcoin in there" (referring to our LibertyX experiences).

Read up on Bitlicense. A recently released regulation developed by the State of New York was developed to prevent exactly what you describe. If a business is offering to hold BTC on behalf of any residents or businesses in New York, they need to prove their reserves and hold their reserves in a "high value, highly liquid instrument". It is fairly expensive to obtain and can be very expensive to maintain compliance. 
Almost everyone misunderstands some key points about it. First it applies to any business worldwide who wants to offer to hold BTC for any resident or business located in New York. Not that the Bitcoin business needs to be located in New York.
Second, it only applies in the scenario I described. Coffee shops don't need to apply to let customers pay in BTC. Even Bitcoin app developers don't need to apply unless their app allows customers to access BTC being held by the business. 
Basically, if you want to be a Bitcoin bank, you must prove you are up to the task and are responsible. 
@_date: 2015-08-27 11:32:49

When I say wallets, I mean HD (or single-use) wallets all defined under one seed. So it's not like I manage a dozen different word lists or anything like that. One word list on a cryptosteel can be used to recover a hundred wallets spread across two dozen coins and all of the balances of all those wallets from all of those coins can be seen on the Ledger Live dashboard, regardless of which coin-specific apps are installed on the Nano S at the time.
You don't even need to reinstall the coin-specific app to update your balances in previously detected wallets. If you load up support for a coin, register the wallet in Ledger Live and then remove support for that coin from the Nano S, the Ledger Live dashboard will always show the balance, even if you send more coin to a previously detected wallet.
You only need to connect the Nano S when you want to send some coin, start using a new coin or register a new wallet for a coin that you've used previously.

mobi.me? It changes between dozens of currencies worldwide and transfers funds with a simple text message.
It's a little weird, though, in that the balance is reported in BTC, but is apparently pegged to the ~~dollar~~ original deposit amount. So you can deposit $100 worth and your balance will always show $100 worth. Not sure how they plan to withstand bear markets and downturns. Maybe by hedging in other currencies. Developed by BTCC so do what you wish with that information.
Supposed to be very simple to use worldwide. I haven't tried it out. I heard about it on the Unchained podcast.

Stolen vs withdrawn, who knows, but $24,000 yesterday and $30,000 in all between Christmas and the day before yesterday. Very infrequent withdrawals before that, typically once or twice every month or two, whenever the mood struck them it seems.
@_date: 2015-07-08 18:57:31
Is no bank verification good enough for you? Did you know you can walk into any bank and deposit cash into anyone's account without having the bank identify or track you? There is a user here who sells BTC to people who deposit cash into his bank account. He uses most big banks, so if you don't want to use your bank branch where people recognize you, just use a different branch or a completely different chain if you're that nervous. He's held thousands of transactions and is very active in here.
But first I think you need to decide just what it is about banks you're trying to avoid: them knowing what you're doing with your money in your account? or just the act of even walking into a bank, even if no one knows who you are or checks your identity? If you don't mind depositing cash anonymously into someone else's account, then LBC isn't so bad.

No idea. At this point I seriously doubt anyone who hasn't obtained a Bitlicense yet but needs to is blocking their service yet. That was one of the complaints about the implementation: the difficulty in determining who needs to be blocked and how to block them. 
I appreciate your attempt at highlighting the need to fight Bitlicense. You just happened to focus on the wrong criteria. It's the fact that they offer a hosted wallet service presumably available to residents and businesses in New York, not that they're based in New York. 
@_date: 2015-07-18 12:08:29
I keep seeing comments like this on this guy's posts. Bitlicense has nothing to do with where the business is located. It applies to anyone worldwide who offers their services to any resident or business located in NY State. 
It also applies specifically to businesses that hold balances on behalf of their customers. I'm sure that's why OP keeps saying they prefer that customers get off their online hot wallets as quickly as possible - he doesn't want to attract the attention of NYDFS. 
If a business wants to offer to hold clients' funds, they have two choices: get a Bitlicense and follow the rules or block New York residents and businesses from accessing their service. That applies worldwide.

You kinda went a little New Hampshire there, but just in case you're serious.
BitLicense was developed in the wake of MTGOX. NY basically said, "We are the financial capital of the world. If you want to hold money or assets on behalf of other people (in this case, New Yorkers), you're going to have to jump through some major hoops to prove that you're serious about this and aren't just some guy in his Mom's basement."
Exchanges have to prove they have all the policies and procedures required when holding other people's money, cyber security to protect against internal and external threats, and also a certain amount of cash reserves in case everyone tries to sell at once. 
Even if you're not in NY, you can know that a company that has been authorized to operate in NY has gone through A LOT to prove they are a legitimate business and are capable of being very responsible when it comes to holding money or assets on behalf of other people.
Just the application process is said to cost over $100,000. Forget about the cost involved in establishing and funding the business to be able to handle other people's money responsibly. If you are licensed or got a free pass to skip the license because you already have a license with even stricter requirements, you have proven that you are taking this responsibility very seriously. 
Unfortunately for many people in here, "taking it seriously" means following all the Anti Money Laundering/Know Your Customer laws.

The ShapeShift integration has piqued my interest, that's for sure. I just need that on the Nano S. 
@_date: 2017-04-12 12:30:15
Not much, really. I give some to friends to demo the technology. I also occasionally play in r/MillionaireMakers.
If you're not familiar, you submit a comment to enter a monthly drawing and if your comment is chosen in a random drawing, then everyone else who entered is supposed to send you a dollar. No one is compelled to pay (and the mods can't legally request money up front), so you can guess what happened with participation over time. 
35,000 people will enter and about 400 people donate about $1,000 to the winner. 
That offered a way to practice using Mycelium. I would first move the $1 I intended to give to the winner into a single use address. Then, I would digitally sign my entry comment using that address and finally post the signed entry into the contest thread. After each drawing, I would wait for the winner to post their BTC deposit address and pay them the dollar I always intended to pay. 
It was an easy way to prove ahead of time that I intended to donate and made it easily verifiable exactly when I set aside the $1 and exactly when I paid each winner, unlike the 800 people who just write, "PayPal sent!" and go back on their merry way. 
@_date: 2017-04-03 01:17:17
Wow, what a whacked out thread. 
The Nano was the original Nano. Not the Nano S. And the HW.1 used the same technology as the original Nano (and both are different from the Nano S). The original Nano doesn't have a screen, but the Nano S and the Blue do. You don't have to use any of the Ledger devices on an offline computer, but you did have to SETUP the original Nano on one. You don't even need an offline computer to setup the new Nano S.
The Nano does run some proprietary code, but it also has an attestation test, so it will not run if someone messed with it in transit. You have to inspect the tamper evident sticker on the Trezor box, but there is no need for one with Ledger. If it runs, it's legit. 
Both the Ledger devices and the Trezor can optionally provide the crypto backend for wallet apps on your phone, but only the Ledger devices are small enough to hang on your keychain. 
Finally, the older Ledger devices may be sold out at Ledger, but there are plenty available via Amazon. Again, if it boots, it has not been molested. The older Ledger devices only support Bitcoin, so you may not be interested in them. Also, the older devices didn't need USB cables, so they had an edge there, but the S uses one now, just like the Trezor.
@_date: 2017-04-03 12:02:54


You may have meant this, but you should create a new address for each transaction, not each user. Every purchase should generate a balance due, and you should link one address to each purchase.

Not "development hurdles"? That shim was TINY!
For those who don't know, it doesn't actually run on the SIM. It's a device that fits between the SIM and the contacts of the SIM socket and fools the phone into thinking that the SIM is running secure wallet software. That's a pretty wild innovation, IYAM.

Thanks for the tip, but I'd rather you spend it there if you can and encourage them to keep it going. There's also Daiquiri Shak in Madeira Beach. They tried, but the BitPay app crashed when I tried to pay. 
They were super apologetic, and tried hard to fix it so I could pay with BTC, but no one had the credentials to log back in -- not even the owner when they called him on the phone. Hopefully they take it a little more seriously by now if they still take it.

Bitwage does it. You may either sign up as a regular employee who wants to receive some or all of their paycheck in Bitcoin or sign up as a business owner or independent contractor who wants to invoice companies in fiat but get paid in BTC. 
Does exactly what you're asking.
@_date: 2016-09-08 16:47:56
When you order something to be shipped to you, you expose some information about yourself. No, that information is not exposed to everyone just because you used Bitcoin. As described by the other commenter, though, everyone can see the balance in every address. So think about what information you're releasing since it can be tied to the address you'll use in the purchase. 
If you have a ton of BTC and need to make a sensitive purchase, you may wish to exchange the amount you're about to spend (plus a pad for fees) into another coin and then immediately exchange it back to BTC in an entirely new wallet. Then make the purchase from the new wallet. Then no one can link the funds you used in the purchase back to your original (and presumably much larger) stash. You may even wish to change your location and use a different WiFi at different stages of the washing process if you really want to get nuts about it.

Buying and spending quickly to miss the price swings also helps you avoid the capital gains taxes that would apply if you hold for a little while before spending. Similarly with day trading, no one talks about losing 43% of your gains to short term capital gains taxes. So you lose almost half your gains right off the top.

This is a lot of work and assumes someone who steals your phone is going after your Bitcoin. People keep saying that hardware wallets are for large balances, but the Ledger HW.1 has the same exact hardware and runs the same exact software as the original Nano, but costs just 15€. 
You plug it into your micro USB port using an OTG adapter and it works directly with Mycelium. You only need to physically insert the device (which is about the size of your thumbnail) to spend BTC. You don't need it to "make a deposit" or check the balance. The HW.1 or Nano stay somewhere safe like on your keychain or in your bugout bag. If someone robs you of your phone, they can't do a single thing with your balances without the wallet, the OTG adapter and your PIN. 
I travel constantly for work, so my laptop bag stays with me like the nuclear codes with the President. I have several HD wallets in Mycelium and a couple on my Nano. I added the critical one on my Nano as a "watch only" HD wallet on Mycelium.
Note that Ledger HQ also makes a software version of the HW.1 and Nano, but it only runs in the secure embedded processing area on a handful of cellphones, like the Samsung Galaxy S6 or newer and the Note 5 or newer. From what I can tell, that only improves protecting the keys from malware and doesn't provide the physical separation I described above.
@_date: 2016-09-16 15:58:50
Ugh, sorry to hear this.
I can't help but think if you used Electrum on TAILS and memorized your seed words, this would be an entirely different post.
You can also work with someone located anywhere else on Earth to help manage your spend transactions. You only need to show your deposit QR to receive donations and you can send other deposit QRs to remote people via SMS/MMS in order to coordinate spends. There is really no need to store your keys on your person in high risk areas. 
Or spend $20 on a Ledger HW.1 and jump right to the top in Bitcoin security. Again, sorry for your loss.
@_date: 2016-09-27 22:54:28
Also check out TAILS OS and it's built in copy of Electrum. The OS is designed to not leave a trace of anything you do online during each session. An added benefit is that you get to (need to) enter your 12 or 13 seed words into Electrum each time. Perfect if you can memorize a string of words. Some people remove hard drives from old laptops and boot them up from a TAILS CD. If you can memorize a few different word lists, then you can establish your own honeypot address lists that you can display under duress and make it look like that's where you your business.

That's how LibertyX is able to protect themselves while offering instantaneous transfers. BTC is usually coming in for me before I leave the store. And they don't offer web wallets. They transfer BTC into an address that you specify in the app. Sure you can tell them to deposit in a web wallet, but that's like pouring Tabasco on a banana split sundae. 
The fees charged by the red stores can vary wildly. There's a 9% store in Manhattan near the Empire State Building and a 1 or 2% store way out in Brooklyn or Staten Island or something.

Exactly. Any security site will tell you to turn off uPNP. So unless someone who rolls out Core also knows how to setup port forwarding, it does no good to just install Core and run it as described. That's why I brought this up. You don't just install Core and drink a beer.

Also missing two of the best options we have in the US.

My wife is pretty disgusted with the government and banking system, so she was pretty receptive to learning about Bitcoin back in 2014.
We bought our first coin in Tampa a couple weeks after the Bitcoin Bowl, and I gave her a quarter of the balance. Then we paid BTC for some coffee on Tampa's "Bitcoin Boulevard" in the shadow of the stadium where the game was held. A week later, we attended the North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami. A week later we bought some quartz with BTC thanks to someone advertising his girlfriend's family's stone business in here.
Not sure if I can point to any single video. We just dove in (well, stuck our toes in) and now that she has an inheritance coming, she asked about skipping the bank and putting it in BTC.

1. Do NOT publish the numbers you were given either here or in a PM. 
1. This is a very strange way of doing this. The sender should have asked you for the address where you want it sent. 
If you're familiar with PGP or GPG, you would normally verify digitally signed content against a public key. It's similar in Bitcoin, but not exactly the same. We can verify digital signatures against a Bitcoin address and can also look at the balance of any address without necessarily being able to spend the BTC sitting in that address.
If he sent you a private key, there is a high risk that he can take the BTC out of there before you untangle the numbers he sent you.
Your best course of action right now would be to install a high quality mobile wallet like Mycelium if you're on Android, click Receive, click Copy to Clipboard and paste the address into a text message or email. Verify that the numbers and letters you paste match the ones shown on the Receive screen and send it, asking him to send it to you there. 
No one should make you jump through hoops like that to receive BTC. Also, as soon as possible, back out of the Receive screen, go to the Accounts tab, click on your wallet, hit the the dots in the top right corner and click on a menu item that says to make a backup. 
You will write down 12 words and keep them safe and secure somewhere. Should something ever happen to your phone, those words will get you access to your balance in other ways and will prevent you from coming back here with a "My phone died and I didn't have a backup" post.

I travel about 40 weeks a year, and my employer offers to direct deposit my expense reimbursements separate from my regular paycheck. So I just went all in with BitWage on my expense reimbursements. Whenever I don't want to buy BTC, I use my AMEX for everything. If the price is looking good, I just spend more out of pocket since it all comes back to me in BTC. 
I like the safety and convenience of xpub support. They pay to a different address on one of my Nano HD wallets every week and I can monitor the deposits and balance from Mycelium without risking anything. 
Very happy so far. Not sure I would send my entire paycheck there, only because I have so many normal bills to pay.
@_date: 2016-09-28 09:02:27
Exactly. Just spend the 15€ on an HW.1 to at least get a foot in the door.
@_date: 2016-09-11 19:06:23
I get that you don't want to use a HW wallet, but you specifically said "old laptop". I would strongly encourage you to just spend the $20 on a HW.1 (a Nano without the "fancy" packaging). Much safer than pulling something off the junk pile. Unless you're doing it just to learn -- then have at it. Otherwise, not such a hot idea, IMHO.

In Mycelium, go to the Accounts tab. Click the key with the "+" up top. Type in your PIN if you have one. Click Advanced at the bottom. Click scan up top. Center the scammer's QR code in the picture and when it is scanned, you will be shown a suggested name but allowed to change it at that time. 
Next go to the Transactions tab and locate your transaction. Click on it to select it and click the tag up top. Enter a short meaningful description, like "My tx". That will make it easier to spot in the list of transactions, assuming there are more than a couple.
@_date: 2016-09-26 10:58:50
Fyi, the Nano and HW.1 work directly with Mycelium. Using an OTG adapter to convert a phone's micro USB port to a standard one will let you plug in the Nano or HW.1 and spend directly from the device attached to your phone.

Definitely agree with getting the screen replaced. Also, if you're not aware, having a Note 5 puts you in a unique situation. Ledger, the makers of the Nano, HW.1, Nano S and other devices have developed an app that basically converts a secure area of the phone into a software equivalent of the Nano. If you continue to use Mycelium on the phone going forward, be sure to check out the Ledger Trustlet. Gives you all of the security of one of the best hardware wallets without an additional hardware purchase required.

@_date: 2016-09-17 11:35:51
Not sure if you're familiar with hardware wallets. They are hardened devices that are specifically designed to never expose your private keys ever, under any circumstances. Trezor and Ledger are two of the best known brands out there. Ledger has a few different items in their product line.
The two devices they started with are based on the chip on bank cards that have been protecting personal bank transactions around the world for nearly twenty years. Ledger has developed specialized embedded software for the chips and came up with a physical design for the chip that allows the physical contacts on the surface of the chip to also serve as a USB interface. You literally insert the device directly into a USB port. No cables required. 
These devices are small, too. Like thumbnail sized. The HW.1 is barely double the size of the chip itself. The (first gen) Nano, which is what I have, is comparable to a small house or locker key. Both are built using the same exact chip and software. The HW.1 starts at 15€. It used to be that you needed a computer running Chrome to send BTC from the devices, but a while ago they partnered with Mycelium to provide extreme levels of protection that only a hardware wallet can provide for an already excellent mobile application. You only need a small adapter to convert a phone's micro USB port to a full sized one. 
They also didn't stop there. If you have one of a few different cell phone handset models, such as the Samsung Galaxy S6 or above or the Galaxy Note 5 or above, then you also already have an embedded controller capable of providing a high security isolated operating environment. Ledger is porting their embedded code to run on that embedded environment. It is called the Ledger Trustlet and can be downloaded from the Play Store. All of the benefits of having a hardware wallet without having to actually buy one. It, too, is already compatible with Mycelium. 
I've only described a couple of their Bitcoin-only devices. They have a few more and also recently released the (only?) hardware wallet for Bitcoin AND Ethereum, the Nano S. 
Check out ledgerwallet.com, r/Ledgerwallet and look out for u/btchip and u/murzika. They are constantly around here and provide awesome levels of support and interaction.

You do have to watch how much your BTC was worth when you bought it and when you spent it. You need to pay taxes any time some BTC you spent went up while you held it unless you can identify other BTC that went down in value while you held it. If you haven't been watching how much your BTC has gone up or down between the time you bought it and spent it, you may be way out of compliance.

Bitwage lets you sign up in two different ways. First, for ongoing regular employment, you can get some or all of your direct deposit paid to you in BTC.
For one time billing events, like what this sounds like, Bitwage also enables you to send out an invoice. The payor will pay the invoice in fiat and Bitwage will send it on to you in BTC. 
Bitwage has you covered. I don't work for them, I just recently went through the setup process as a user. I haven't even processed a payment through them yet.

I used to play r/millionairemakers where your comment becomes a "ticket" and you promise to pay the winner. Explicitly not a lottery. 
The winners were selected by running an algorithm against the contents of the Bitcoin blockchain at a specific moment in time in the future and the drawing code was open source. Participants could even run the drawing code in parallel with the mods to make sure everyone got the same results. Winners would list half a dozen ways they were accepting payouts, including many different cryptocurrencies.
For me, I used to move my future payment for each drawing to a new address, write my entry comment, and then digitally sign the text with the private key of the new address. I used the blockchain to prove my intent to pay the winner before the drawing took place. That also established an easy way to verify my paying each winner along the way should I eventually win one round myself. It was cheap fun at $1 a month, and I got to learn a little about blockchain stuff. 
My method never caught on, though, and there was hardly any way to publicly verify anyone who just wrote "sent PayPal" and lied through their teeth. The system eventually fell apart when each month, about 3,000 out of 65,000 participants would send about $3,500 of the promised $65,000 minimum. It really brought out the worst in people and therefore the worst on Reddit. 
A new crypto-only version aims to rise from the ashes, and maybe it will happen one day. It'll be pretty cool if it does, especially if the whole system no longer relies on the general goodness of man. Just an ice cold smart contract.

And just because of the other conversation, I've been a happy customer since 2016. 
Note that you will find complaints about their exchange rate. They bury a 4.5% fee in there. Also, they only offer payouts in up to two of three coins they support at no extra charge.
They charge extra fees if you want to receive any of your original paycheck in fiat or any of dozens of other coins or more than two wallets. I'm lucky in that I receive two independent Direct Deposit feeds. I send the smaller one to BitWage and convert 100% of it into BTC only going to one address. I must be one of very few clients who do not incur any extra fees for their services.
100% of my payment goes to one coin at one xpubkey address, although it's about time I switch to another coin.

At one point, their random number generator was found to not be quite random. Someone was able to figure out the private key from the public key. Luckily, a white hat went in and scooped up as many addresses as he could before the black hats did. He setup a system to return everyone's money if they could prove ownership.

Yes, you are absolutely correct. Since the context was his spending BTC through his card and my regular use of the phrase "while you held it" (being past tense), the fact that you are no longer holding it was implied.

The keys must exist in memory at least long enough to sign a spend transaction. If you root your phone and get some targeted malware, it may be able to access the key while it's in memory. Even though using a key to sign a transaction typically results in emptying the balance from the associated address, it is said that if someone gets their hands on one key used in an HD wallet, they can calculate all of your keys.
I personally haven't seen the details behind that, but that's what is often said.
Luckily, you can offload the key management activities to hardware wallets like the Ledger HW.1 or Nano or if you have a recent Galaxy S or Galaxy Note, install the Ledger Trustlet which runs the Ledger embedded software in a secure section of your phone.
@_date: 2016-09-12 11:18:28
They don't hold spent transactions either, only unspent transaction outputs, aka utxos.
The entire point of Blockchain is to agree what balances are associated with each address. Balances move by transactions that shift a balance from one or more address to one or more other addresses. In Bitcoin, when you go to send BTC from your wallet to another one, the protocol actually sends your entire balance. The portion you requested to go to the recipient goes as planned, and the leftover amount goes to a new address (intended to be another address that you control). The balances that move are not combined with other balances that may already be in that address. The amounts that arrive remain intact. 
They are the outputs from prior transactions that have yet to be spent. They are unspent transaction outputs or utxos. 
So when you go to send some BTC, your client scoops up all the utxos sitting in your address and constructs a transaction that sends almost enough utxos to the recipient and splits the last needed utxo to send the last amount needed to send the requested amount. All unneeded utxos and the unspent portion you got to keep from the last one that was split go to your next address in your HD wallet.
Your new address now has all of the utxos that were not needed to complete the prior transaction as well as the portion you got to keep of the final utxo that completed the prior send. If anyone sends you BTC to your current receive address, the utxos from that receive action will join the other utxos already sitting there. You will see an updated balance but the utxos do not merge. They remain intact. 
This becomes a problem when spammers will send you ridiculously tiny amounts with a spam message attached. It becomes too expensive to pay for the cost of attaching a utxo to a transaction when the value of the utxo itself is less than the cost of attaching it. 
Read up on dust to learn more about that.

There's a difference between the public key and the Bitcoin address. Every Bitcoin address that has received BTC is listed in the Blockchain. The associated public key is only exposed when you digitally sign a spend transaction (or text message, I would assume). Therefore, if you use a new address every time you spend (standard practice on most wallet apps), you don't expose the public key for the address holding your current balance until you are emptying the address with at least a portion going to a new address whose public key has not yet been exposed.

I use Bitcoin Paranoid. Keeps the price in the notification list, so just pull the notification bar down for a peek and the price is always right there. 
Edit to respond to other comments: The update interval is configurable. The price is also available on the lock screen. It also offers green and red up and down arrows to show large movements of a configurable percentage. My _only_ nitpick is when the large movements occur, the notification shows the percentage movement "from" and the amount it changed not the price that it is using to determine a large movement. So it may say "Down 6% from $7.89 to $10,500". It is worded strangely, but you get the point. Other than that, it's a great app. They even have a donation link that is handled properly by Mycelium! Very impressed.

OP, you deposited cash into a Bitcoin ATM and displayed a QR the scammer gave you as a deposit address. You have no technological link to the Bitcoin transaction. There's so very little you can do at this point. You didn't send the Bitcoin yourself, so you can't even try to double spend it. You don't even know the address from which your payment arrived. But if you got a receipt and look at the transaction history of the scammer's address, you can likely figure that out. 
If you install a mobile wallet, you can add the scammer's QR code as a Watch Only address and see how many other people are sending them money.
Since you went to the authorities, it doesn't sound like you were trying to buy anything illegal. If you see tons of transactions sending money to that address, you could go to the FBI with it. Since the amount stolen from you exceeds $500, they're already in felony territory. If the scammer periodically empties the address and slips up once by forgetting to use a VPN, they may be able to find the offender. But if the offender knows Bitcoin well enough to have each victim send cash to a different address, then the task just became monumentally more difficult.

In addition to the quality answers you've already received, this is where the Blockstream Satellite makes things interesting. For about $100 in parts, people on 5 continents can monitor Bitcoin payments without Internet access (and without anyone knowing which addresses you're checking).
So if you use a simple HD wallet for all of your sales, you'll know ahead of time the sequence of addresses in which your customers will be asked to send a payment. Alternatively, you could establish an ongoing relationship with each client. They will tell you where to ship your product when setting up their account with you. You will give them a QR code that establishes the entire sequence of addresses they will use to pay you. You will detect an order when a payment arrives on the next address they were scheduled to use. You can make this arrangement with each client so they only need to send you the shipping details once (or when it changes). 
Any time you detect a payment to a specific address or set of addresses, you'll know exactly who paid you without ever logging into the Internet to check. Payments go right to your hardware wallet and no one has to know.
@_date: 2016-09-13 16:55:31
Exchanges will sell you BTC for fiat or exchange between cryptos (BTC and others). Wallets are just a mechanism for storing the private key(s) that let you spend balances and make it easy for you to tell others how to send BTC to you.
You can go to bitaddress.org and wiggle your mouse around until you get a wallet. You can get wallets there all day, but no one there is going to sell you BTC -- that's what an exchange does.
Similarly, before signing up at Bitwage, I used LibertyX for my purchases. They are an exchange but they do not manage any wallets for you. Part of the buying process involves telling them where to deposit the BTC. Same for Bitwage. You must tell them where to deposit the BTC that they will give you in exchange for each paycheck you send them via direct deposit.

It does require a PIN code, though and will wipe after a few incorrect entries. IMHO not entering the seed words in a random order is the real problem. I also wish it supported opening different accounts with different passwords. I can open entirely different HD wallets in Electrum on TAILS for instance by entering a different set of seed words. Great if i ever have to do that under duress. 
That being said, I love my Nano and wouldn't swap it for anything.

Sure thing. There's another option, too.
Get another cheap phone (but not an old one that's prone to dying) and install Mycelium on it. Create as many HD wallets as you want on that copy. Export the public key for one or more HD wallets and add them to your walkaround phone. Then you can deposit BTC and check your balances all you want. You just can't spend from those new accounts without using the phone that's sitting safely at home or somewhere else.
My point being if you truly want to treat a specific HD wallet as a savings account, make it easy to deposit funds and check the balance but make it a tiny bit harder to spend from it (like, you can only spend from a specific phone, not the one you carry all the time). Just about any Android will do. You don't even need to activate it with a carrier, just put it on WiFi long enough to install and update Mycelium and those rare times where you spend from it.
Even then, this approach still is not price competitive against an HW.1, a device that was built from the very beginning to transact in BTC and protect your balances under all circumstances.

Exactly as ohituna says, plus the same applies when you swap between cryptos. So when I want to get into Ethereum, for instance, I buy new BTC and swap it into Ethereum right away so that I don't have to worry about losing or making money on it while it was in BTC.
If you have some old BTC sitting around that has risen from $200 to $600, you would trigger a taxable event if you changed some of it into Ether.
I start a new HD wallet every time I buy BTC and record the exchange rate and purchase date for each one so I know exactly how much I'm making or losing each time I spend or convert BTC. I can also just look at the name of the wallet and compare it to current prices to easily see which BTC is at or below current market prices (or if I have to buy fresh BTC because I would make too much profit off all my current BTC). Luckily, I still have a batch sitting there from $670 earlier this year so it'll be a while.

Check out steganography tools. The text version of the address is encoded into the binary data that constructs the picture. A QR code is just another graphical representation of the address. One wouldn't typically go to the extra effort of embedding a QR code inside a picture when it would be far easier to just encode the text version of the key you are trying to send. Again it's not impossible, but doing so is a whole bunch of extra work.
With steganography, you can embed a smaller digital file inside a larger one. If you secure it with a password, it will be difficult to detect with street-level tools. Once you provide someone with the password, their steg detect tools will find and extract the hidden file.

For 5 and 6, there are no taxes due on BTC that you purchase unless and until you spend it, sell it or exchange it into another crypto AND it has gone up in value while you held it. 
So if you buy $1k, it grows to $1,200 over 18 months and you move all $1,200 into Ethereum, you are responsible for 23% of $200 in capital gains the following April. If you buy and exchange it to another crypto on the same day, then you shouldn't have any gains to declare from the short time you held it as BTC.
There is a contingent of people who believe it is never taxable until you sell it for fiat. That you can somehow swap in and out across all cryptos, exchanging your way to millions of dollars' worth tax free (until you sell it for fiat). This is incorrect. 
Mining income is taxed as income and taxed again as described above if it increases in value before you have a chance to sell or spend it.
@_date: 2017-09-23 14:08:22
Yup. If you look at the BTC rich list, you'll see a handful of addresses that have been reused but now store tens of millions of dollars' worth of BTC. I think they are something like a canary in the coal mine. If several of those addresses empty in rapid succession, they may have been cracked. 
The worst is one case where the owner deposited and withdrew 1 BTC just to make sure it works before depositing what was recently worth $42 million. That simple check likely placed the entire balance at risk a few decades from now.

The QR should either be a link to a bitcoin:// URL which would be handed off to a wallet app or accompanied by a text version of the Bitcoin address that is encoded into the QR. Copy that address into the clipboard, launch the wallet app, and paste the address from the clipboard into the form you are completing in your wallet app.

I installed Bread on an old 5S I had just to play with it. Never wrote down my seed words. It also never asked me to setup a PIN and is demanding one. Can't wipe the seed and start over. Uninstall and reinstall left me in the same position. Searched Google and found a bunch of people reporting the same thing. Wanted to see it. Tried to get serious with it later but the app won't let them. I can't do anything with it now. 
I'm a 24 year Linux guy in IT so I'm all about Android and Mycelium is the way to go for me; that and my Nano. We can talk to Rassah, BTChip and Murzika all day in here. Can't get a lick of help resetting Bread and starting over, just like a bunch of others. Not on my recommended list.

Check your records, get the TX dates and see if you made any money during the exchanges. If you made less than 50c in any transfer (or lost money) then you have nothing to report. So if you got out of BTC because it was tanking and lost a little before you got out, you're still good. If you got into ETH to participate in the DAO and got killed there, you're still good. If you got into XMR after it took off (and then plateaued again), you're still good. 
On the other hand, if you got into BTC with $10k, rode it from $250 to $700 and then exchanged all $27k into ETH immediately after the DAO collapse and rode that recovery from $4.50 to $11 before taking your (now) $62k into XMR then yeah, you have some untangling to do. If that was all in less than a year, then yeah, you likely owe 43% on the $52k you made in swaps. 
Download ALL of the IRS guidance on cryptocurrencies and find a tax professional. You need to know how much you paid per unit each time you bought anything and then figure out how much it was worth when you got out. 
That's why I start a new HD wallet with every BTC purchase. So I know the exact date, time and cost paid each time.

_can be_
It's likely an accounting nightmare, to be sure, but it's only a reportable event if you made more than 50c in capital gains while you held. You could only fund the debit card with BTC that was purchased at or above the current price but make sure your withdraw cash at an ATM before the price has a chance to rise, making it taxable again. 
That's why I like Gyft. You can buy gift cards at hundreds of places using BTC that you know is safe to spend and sit on the gift cards until you're ready to spend them. 
You're absolutely correct, though, it takes a lot more work to identify funds safe to spend with a debit card. 
@_date: 2016-09-19 23:32:49
Sometimes I feel like a broken record, but consider the tax implications. You need to record how much BTC you bought each time you bought it and what the exchange rate was at the time you bought it. Then you need to record those same values when you go to spend it at a later date. If the BTC you are spending has gained more than 50c in value, then you need to report it to the IRS so you can pay either 23% or 42% on that increase in value, depending on how long you held it. If BTC goes up between the time you buy it and the time you spend it, that is not free money. 
Now, which would you rather figure out: how much you owe if you bought $200 worth one day which became $250 a few months later, or 100 different $2 purchases that all increased in value different amounts until you have 100 different profit margins that all require a different tax payment? Or maybe some that went down and others that went up?
Now Coinbase makes it easy to figure all that out, but is it worth it? Especially if you follow the (correct) advice to get the balances out of Coinbase immediately.
I'd just buy the $200 and watch it go up and down. At least I'd know at all times exactly how much I've made or lost at any given moment in time.

Necroposting here. I somehow missed until now the Blockstream Satellite announcement back in August. I was reminded of this conversation as I learned about the service and the requirements of the ground terminal to receive the feed.
Knowing about it when you posted may have provided a more interesting (and reasonable) solution. Anyone who can get a minimum 45cm satellite dish, a Ku LNB, an SDR, and an old laptop can now receive a live feed of Bitcoin transactions free of monthly charges. They would need to seed it with the current full blockchain, but Blockstream is working on a way to bootstrap entirely off the sat feed.
Anyone with Internet access on their phone can send BTC and anyone with the dish on the island can verify receipt. For transactions initiated by Cubans, customers would need to find a wallet that sends signed transactions via SMS to a gateway that broadcasts the transactions on the network.
There is the added benefit of privacy as no one can detect who is receiving the feeds. There is no inbound Internet access required in order to validate inbound payments. There is no outbound Internet required (by the sender) to send transactions. The sender only needs to get a signed transaction to someone with Internet access. The service is designed to bring Bitcoin to people where Internet service is severely limited or does not exist.
"Just get a dish, LNB, SDR, and an old laptop" may still be a monumental task, but the bar is definitely lower than trying to figure out how to build a nationwide mesh network, including an off-island gateway. If a shop can setup a dish and a paying customer can send an SMS, you can make it work.

I assume this is a Reddit or millenial "no one". Gyft.com allows you to buy gift cards at over 220 stores and restaurants using Bitcoin. Amazon is just one of those retailers. You install the app, setup a buy, complete the buy with your Bitcoin wallet, and spend the gift card in store or online.
Yes, this means only one vendor in the whole discussion truly and directly accepts Bitcoin, but it does nothing to reduce the ultimate utility of it. Amazon alone meets most everyone's needs at home.

There is plenty of room for upside movement during our lifetimes. At $1 million per BTC, the smallest unit is still just worth 1 cent. We just dropped back from $5,000. There is _plenty_ of room to absorb increasing value.  We'll all be dead before the orphaned BTC starts applying pressure on the price. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 08:17:26
Amazon is just one of over 220 vendors whose gift cards you can buy at Gyft. Their cards haven't had an expiration date in 12 years. Some states banned the practice before that. I bought a fridge at Best Buy last year using a pile of cards, some of which were approaching 10 years. 
Do some cards expire? I'm sure. Just not the big name ones I use.

Mining is never designed to end. Miners receive new BTC plus the mining fees attached to every transaction that the miner includes in each mined block. As the amount of new BTC awarded to the miner of each block drops over the years, the fees attached to the transactions were expected to grow in value to gradually replace the new BTC being rewarded. This provides incentive to keep using the system even after the last few Satoshis are mined in the year 2140. If users are still transacting, miners are still collecting the fees (but no new BTC).
Also, the amount of new BTC being created slows down so quickly that it will take 55 years to mine the last 10 new BTC.

It actually doesn't have to be that complicated. With Mycelium, he can create a new HD wallet for each client paying in BTC [and name each one after the patient]. Just pull up [the HD wallet bearing their name] on his phone when they go to pay, click Receive, and then click the keyboard to enter an optional amount.
The patient scans the QR and their wallet will be ready to send the required amount. 
His wallet will show each individual payment sent by each client and all payments from each client will be grouped together and isolated from all other clients. 
It really doesn't get any easier than that if he doesn't want to change their payments to fiat. Just pulls up their name in his list of wallets, clicks Receive and enters how much they need pay. Receive the payment, wait for confirmation, and done. 
Edit: I left out the most important part. Every payment will be received to a different address, exactly the point of the discussion.
And if he doesn't want to store the BTC on his phone, he can actually create the wallets on a Ledger Nano or Nano S, export them to Mycelium and only use the phone to receive the funds on behalf of the Nano. An unscrupulous client could grab his phone while getting ready to pay and not actually get anything. All the payments go straight to the Nano and don't even stop on the phone.

Nah, not with a new private key (and therefore Bitcoin address) being generated for each transaction. If Wanna Cry had been coded correctly, then every single payment to unlock each of the hundreds of thousands of infected computers around the world would have gone to a unique address. 
They screwed it up, though, and the main wave of infections went to just 5 addresses. That makes it look easy to track, but it was just a poor implementation. Imagine if they got it right, and after unlocking each desktop, ShapeShifted each payment into Monero? That money would have gone poof.

When you use an SPV wallet, you always have to ask someone else to tell you your balance. You also expose several addresses at a time to the server. It is difficult to maintain privacy under those conditions. 
If you are a shop that accepts Bitcoin as payment for goods and services, you'll want to do your own verification of receipt of payment. 
If you're worried about bandwidth requirements and are talking strictly about BTC, then Blockstream Satellite makes things interesting. Once you get your node caught up, you don't need an Internet connection anymore. You can stay up to date with a repurposed satellite dish and about $100 worth of equipment. The service itself is free and coverage is expanding around the globe. This offers extreme levels of privacy, as your balance checking activities stay completely off the Internet.

A few years ago, I wrote up a scenario about the [RV homeless]( in Venice Beach. Tons of people live in RVs parked along a couple of streets in the area. Imagine QR codes on the outside of the RV. The code takes you to a YouTube video profile of the person or family living in the RV, and includes a Bitcoin donation link in the description or a shows a QR code at the end of the profile video. People watch the videos and decide who they want to support.
Then, at the weekly farmer's market, have vendors accept Bitcoin as a payment and make sure the area is covered by WiFi.
The homeless would only need a throwaway phone (no service required) and each week at the farmer's market, they'll have some BTC to spend on healthy food options. Maybe they could even find a mechanic or two in the area who would accept BTC to keep their RVs running.
Donors from around the world get to feed some homeless. Farmers get paid directly. Homeless have easy access to some healthy food options. Win, win, win if you ask me.

Hey,sir. I was just looking at the next section in more detail.
    People set up powerful computers just to try and get Bitcoins. This is called mining.
I would also change "powerful computers" to something along the lines of "special purpose computing devices" just to further stress that "there is no computer equipment currently in your house that can help do this." As you know, people keep coming back with "but what about this &lt;insert random GPU here&gt;?"
Actually, as I'm reading more, the more it seems the whole section may need some tweaking.
    It could be years before you mine a single Bitcoin.
    You could end up spending more on electricity than what you will earn in Bitcoin.
Those are accurate statements, of course, but I don't think they stress enough the points they're trying to make. This may have had the right amount of influence back when the article first appeared, but it may not have the punch it needs to make sure people get the right idea the first time the read it. People need to understand you can't compete with today's commercial mining operations with a PC or a block erupter.
Please PM me if you'd like to keep chatting about it or if you'd like some help. I'll be happy to help out in any way that I can (or stay out of your garden!) I can show you some examples of my instructional writing from the past, so you may or may not be interested in new text.

Two things: chip and PIN has already been defeated and cloned cards with some kitting will approve any PIN; also, the US is getting chip and signature, not chip and PIN.

Nice and easy, right? Did you check to see if the Trailblazer bonus is available for the T-Mobile store you visited? If you can't figure it out from the website, forward your confirmation email to support to tell them how the sale went and ask if the bonus is still available. If it is, they'll deposit another $5 worth of BTC into your address for free. They also want to know if the sale didn't go through or if the name on the building or phone number doesn't match the details in the directory.
tl;dr LibertyX gives $5 in free BTC to the first customer at each store; you should check to see if you qualify (unless you already know you don't).

YIKES. If ever there was a time to not reuse addresses! Reused addresses are the new private keys.
1) Generate a thousand QR codes of deposit addresses spawned from the same HD wallet.
2) Put the images in a folder on the phone
3) When it comes time to receive a payment, flip through the QRs and randomly pick one
4) John pays the selected QR
5) Worker gets a phone call that the payment came through
6) Worker deletes the QR that was just used for payment
Worker can't get robbed because there's no payment system on the phone. Only a thousand pictures (minus a few). Police grab the worker's phone? Nothing to see here. Just several hundred QR codes that reference empty Bitcoin addresses. Worker was caught up in a sting? The only traceable payment(s) are from the sting team.
We must stop with the reusing addresses. It ties people together unnecessarily. I am slowly coming around to this and am starting to see why people have yelled at me about it.

I propose that we usurp the term "brain wallet" to refer to memorizing your 12 words for Electrum or Mycelium. Memorizing 24 for Ledger or Trezor is obviously tougher, but not impossible. I'm not ignoring BreadWallet, I just don't know how many seed words it uses. But seriously, why remember just one key with 36 characters when you can invoke millions of addresses by remembering 12 words? FAR easier and far more effective. No, it doesn't give you the same bragging rights, but it is a much better use of your cells IMHO.

@_date: 2015-04-22 18:31:57
Don't discount the fact that you can likely eliminate millions of addresses to try each time you find that the first address in the series was never involved in a transaction. This ultimately leads to a significant reduction of the searchable space. No, its not impossible that an address from BitAddress lands squarely in the middle of an HD key sequence. Think of the speed improvements gained by checking to see if the first address in the series was *ever* involved in a transaction. If not, you can eliminate vast numbers of addresses from your search space. If you mate it up with a copy of Bitcoin Core running on the same machine or within your local network, your searches will go MUCH faster than hitting an API.
AFAICT, generating the next keys in the sequence is not that intensive -- think about how quickly Mycelium does it or Electrum in a VM. All of the heavy lifting happens when choosing the 12 words. I do enterprise IT, so when I approach thought problems like these, I'm imagining a blade chassis full of 16 blades each running 4-way 8-core CPUs and 128GB RAM. If I could borrow a setup like that for a night, I'd come back in the morning to a crapload of HD wallets to search in a VM on my laptop, and they would all fit on a USB key. I'm retiring in 15 years. I have a LONG time to find my retirement money hidden in there.
If you could generate a million HD word lists overnight, how long would it take to scan the first address generated by each list, looking for one whose first address ever participated in a transaction? Think about how many billions of trillions of addresses you could eliminate from your search if the first address in the sequence never participated in a transaction.
tl;dr you only have to generate the first key based on the word list; if it never participated in a transaction, move on and don't bother with the next few million addresses in the sequence

Only the funds in the private key they grabbed. You chose the word "import" meaning to add the key pair to your wallet without transferring any funds. If you chose the word "swept", meaning you actually transferred the balance from x into y and then someone grabbed y's key, then yes, they would have access to your combined total -- only because you previously combined your balances.

If you find locations near you, you walk in, put cash on the counter and tell them you want to buy LibertyX on the QPay network. You choose how much to pay and they print a receipt.
Go to LibertyX.com/store, login and click Redeem a PIN. Locate the PIN on the receipt, enter it on the website and copy and paste in your current receive address from your favorite wallet. You will see coin start arriving almost immediately.

I once searched Twitter (or was it G+?) for mentions of my small hometown and found a guy who posts every day about how government agents are driving around in police cars and radiating his brain. Then I followed it.... _deeper_..... and found a whole underworld of people who are enlightened about the mind control. They can feel when the police cars turn on the machines and shut down their thoughts. How they turn into zombies for a few minutes up to an hour while the agent in the police car shuts them down.
I stopped searching for my small hometown after that.

Does it offer a mountable filesystem? If so, you could store a tiny text file with at least one public/private keypair in it and be done with it.
If you were looking for offline transaction signing that lights up different LEDs to use for 2FA, that would be awesome but I think it will be a long time before that's even possible.

I agree with you in principle, but I tend to stay away from 100+ year analyses. It should take about 48 years to mine the last 10 BTC, down from 25 BTC every 10 mins on average right now. The reward is going to start noticeably slowing down in about 17 years from now.

Hmm. Doesn't know that the Ledger "wallet" hardware is actually called a Nano. Calls it USB based like it is just a USB flash drive. Hint: it interfaces with a PC in the exact same way as a Trezor - via the USB port. Author makes no reference to the secure element and offline key storage or multiple approaches to 2FA to verify and sign transactions offline just like a Trezor. Wraps it up with "Trezor is the best" without comparing features. 
Trezor may indeed be the best. Author makes no effort to understand the complete landscape in this "complete" guide and doesn't explain their plainly worded advice in the end.

I understand you're drawing a distinction, but the two should never ever be linked together even in the slightest way. I'm not sure how long you've been around OSS, Linux and the development of POSIX-compliant UNIX-like operating systems. 21 years for me. It's been so long that it didn't dawn on me that there are some people out there who could possibly think that Darwin spawned from Linux or anything from anywhere in the ancestry of Linux until I looked for a link for you and others to read. It seems like there are quite a number of people who think UNIX and all its variants and derivatives were born from Linux. It was an eye opener for me.
There are still religious wars going on in terms of what constitutes true freedom in Free Software. The two camps really have nothing to do with each other, besides the look and feel.

Posting for future readers who come across this well written comment. 5 days after you wrote this, Ledger announced 2FA by smartphone. It was already in Beta when you wrote this, but went GA yesterday or the day before. 
You will need to wipe and reflash your Nano and reinstall the Chrome extension, but it works great. The app sends a cryptographic hash of the destination address to your phone for verification so you can see if malware has attempted to change the address.
Basically, the Ledger now has a screen but is still about half the size of your house key on your keychain. They've also released attestation tests to help put an end to the arguments about the number of stickers securing your shipping package. Doesn't solve the risk of a changed firmware hacking the host, but people have to remember it is a smartchip and by no means just a basic USB storage device.

An HD wallet (the new standard found in apps) contains multiple addresses. A paper wallet (the classic approach to generating an address at bitaddress.org) contains just one.

It would be very easy for someone to redirect payments for candy to their own Bitcoin address. Of course, OP should never reuse the same address or should at least watch the wallet from behind the counter to see deposits as soon as they are broadcast. 
So if someone pays while the shopkeeper watches from several feet away and the guest leaves before the payment shows up with 0 confirmations, either the shopper stiffed the shopkeeper or someone covered the QR with their own. 
Alternatives include putting a different QR on each bucket of candy (but that results in several transaction fees) or placing a Piper printer near the candy. Shopper prints out a wallet, picks up candy and takes it to the counter. Shopkeeper tears it in half, tallies up the total and asks the shopper to pay. Shopper pays the public address and takes the public half of the wallet as a receipt. Shopkeeper sweeps the private keys at the end of any day that had a Bitcoin transaction. 
This would be one of those cases for a wallet that supports paying multiple outputs on a single tx fee. The shopper would make their selection, scanning the QRs on each bucket, sending the appropriate amount and finally sign a single transaction paying all the buckets in one tx.

My pleasure. FWIW I went to the Miami conference looking to buy a Trezor but bought a Nano directly from the Ledger CEO instead. It is an amazing little device.
I live on the road with my laptop, so having my Nano and laptop with me everywhere provides me with quite an impressive experience. 
Just the same, I didn't appreciate bootable Tails with Electrum until someone compared it to my Ledger Nano (and I'm a 20+ year Linux guy, just on the enterprise side). Nothing about my wallet addresses exists until I recall my 12 words. That's some formidable competition to the hardware products compared herein. 
@_date: 2015-04-12 10:55:57
This was something of a flash in the pan story around here. Apparently every 7-11 in South Korea sells Bitcoin through a machine that I guess normally sells top up cards. You choose how much you want to pay and get a receipt printed. Show the cashier the receipt and pay them. Enter a code on the receipt at the website and BTC starts coming in. 
Works almost exactly like LibertyX in the US. 
@_date: 2015-09-16 13:05:08
Maybe you were thinking this and just didn't come out and say it, but I like the idea of enhanced functionality coming and going from the app so long as the user is paying for it to be there. It needs to come and go, though, not just be a one time payment to activate those features -- a tiny trickle of a payment only when the users need those functions to be present.
Also, unfortunately, you're counting on the goodwill of mankind. There is no technical solution that can solve the problem of piracy so long as the exchange of money is involved. There will ALWAYS be someone looking to use paid software for free.
Now if the desktop version of the app dynamically generated a one off bitcoin address just for that user at install time and used the approach I described above, then perhaps you're getting closer. Then when pirates install the pirated version, they'll only get the free functionality until they send BTC to the address generated for them at install time. The key is to make it impossible for the pirates to alter the BTC address generation algorithm, thus causing the same address to be generated each time.
tl;dr Distribute the software for free but unlock the extended features via payment to a specific address generated at install time, and consume that payment over the course of hours of use.

Rough guideline, if you plan on having more than say a few thousand dollars worth of BTC over the long term then I would definitely get a Ledger Nano. Nothing better on the market at the moment for the money. It uses commercial grade security trusted by the financial industry for years and it is small enough that you can easily carry it on your keychain at all times. Since you're a security guy, you'll appreciate how small the attack surface is. You'll need weeks alone with $500k in gear to steal keys from the device and you'll destroy it in the process. It also performs a secure 2FA using your cellphone. Finally, thanks to the attestation tests, you don't have to count the number of stickers that held the packaging together. It will fail safe if someone gets their hands on it and manages to alter the firmware. All this for 1/3rd the cost of a Trezor. 
If you don't want to spend money on a hardware wallet, look into Tails, a special purpose version of Linux that boots from a USB drive and runs entirely from system memory. It has a copy of the Electrum Bitcoin Wallet installed. When you start it up for the first time, write down the 12 words randomly selected to serve as the key behind your wallet. Everything you do when interacting with that Bitcoin wallet is destroyed every time you shut down the OS (hw keyloggers aside). If you eventually memorize the 12 words behind your key, you can burn your original paper and have one of the safest wallets on Earth. It's configuration details literally don't exist anywhere until you boot up the OS and restore the wallet by entering the 12 words. They even included an On Screen Keyboard for safely avoiding hw keyloggers when entering your key words. Very safe, free (other than the cost of the USB flash drive) and also small enough to put on your keychain like the Ledger Nano. This is one of those rare cases where one of the best solutions available is also among the least expensive.
@_date: 2015-09-13 19:51:22
Yup. I wish the classic definition of brainwallet would just go away leaving it to only refer to memorizing your seed words. Far more useful and effective, especially if you carry a bootable TAILS on your keychain. The Ledger I carry can only mean one thing. TAILS can be for anything.
@_date: 2015-04-29 23:53:07
Someone directed you to download the reference implementation of the software. This app needs to start by downloading every single transaction that has ever occurred since the beginning of time. Unless you have already sent some Bitcoin to your receive address, I suggest like the others that you check out other apps like Electrum for PCs, BreadWallet for Apple devices and Mycelium for Android. It will make for a much more pleasant experience.

Cool, another happy customer. I got the same $5 for a location that dropped off the network a year earlier, although I didn't get the $5 for a location where the girl said, "My boss only lets me click on T-Mobile". I got my $5 for the other two locations. I love 'em. Customer Service is about the best I've seen. Very convenient (to me) and, like you said, some of the best prices out there. My favorite part is explaining that they probably didn't realize they sell Bitcoin. They've always heard of it but had no idea it was sitting right there on their terminal for who knows how long.
I've also had support change the name of the shop as shown on the map to match the name on the building. Usually those small businesses will use the proprietor's initials but put an entirely different name on the outside of the building. So "MJN Solutions" on the map might be "Cellular Connections" when you get there. 
Always happy to see someone else give 'em a shot. Glad it went well for you in the end and that you kept at it after the first location turned out to be invalid. I really hope they survive for a long time. They are some great people and super convenient.

Yeah, this was a huge slip up and shows a misunderstanding of Open Source Software. I once had someone ask me why IBM ported DB2 to Linux stating, "I thought you're only allowed to run Open Source software there?"
You can find all of the social structures and contracts that you find in traditional environments in OSS as well, including paid developers. The suggested approach that was described from the beginning for commercial entities was to give away the software, but charge for support and access to developers.
Put it this way, when IBM invested $2 billion in Linux, it wasn't to buy licenses from Red Hat. It was for, among other things, contributing improvements to the operating system to make it an attractive option for every single computing platform we (used to) sell.

No, when you use an HD wallet, all of the private keys are cryptographically related to each other and are tied together by a list of random words stored in a specific order. A modern wallet app knows all addresses you've used previously and will use in the future. When you send a balance to another address, you actually send the entire amount contained in one or more unspent outputs -- enough to cover the transaction -- and specify where the excess balance beyond the amount you intended to send will be sent. This second address is called the Change Address. When you use a paper wallet with an app that is properly equipped to spend from a paper wallet (like Mycelium for Android), the app will specify your paper wallet's deposit address as the Change Address, returning any unused balance back to your paper wallet.
In a traditional payment scenario, your app will configure the transaction to send the balance you wish to send to the destination address and the app will specify your next deposit address in line as the change address. Since the app knows all of the addresses that are cryptographically related to your HD wallet, the app will always show the correct balance, no matter where in the sequence of millions of addresses your balance currently sits. If someone you've sent BTC to tries to go back and figure out how much BTC you own, they will only know the address from which you sent them their BTC (which now has a balance of zero) and that address will only show two transactions: the first transaction that loaded it either as a Change Address or as an amount you received from someone else and the second transaction when you sent them money and any leftovers to a change address.
tl;dr Each time you send BTC, you send the balance where you wanted to send it and the remainder of your balance will end up in the next address you were scheduled to use -- unless you're (properly) using a paper wallet in which case the excess balance is returned to the paper.

Paper served as a great introduction to me as a bridge between fiat and BTC. I've used Mycelium almost from the beginning of my time here and they very quickly figured out how to spend from paper wallets the right way. This enabled me to carry around paper wallets that were empty until I used Mycelium to load them. Gave me an instant working understanding of Bitcoin. 
I went to TNABC Miami hoping to buy a Trezor but I left with a Ledger Nano and I couldn't be happier. It takes all of the key features of a Trezor but implements it with technology trusted by the commercial financial industry the world over and packages it in a device size that blends in on my keychain, all for 1/3rd the price. The attack surface is miniscule and you don't have to count stickers on your box thanks to their attestation tests. 
The main feature a Trezor has over the Ledger Nano is that if you ever need to restore, you will enter your words in a random order, defeating keyloggers.
INB4 "Screen!" A lot of folks don't seem to know that the Ledger Nano now uses a secure channel to perform 2FA via cell phone.
tl;dr Paper helped me learn quickly and easily, but it soon embodied the wrong way to go about everything in Bitcoin. Also, don't ignore Ledger; this isn't a two party fight.

@_date: 2015-04-20 20:55:53
I would consider doing it for a six month lease. I would be too cognizant of price swings, though. Therefore I would literally likely walk into a LibertyX, pay cash, and either deposit the BTC straight into the landlord's wallet or into my own and then immediately into theirs just for the sake of record keeping. I'd want them to use a different HD wallet for each property and send me a different receive address for each month's payment. They could even give me a sheet of paper in my rental agreement with all the due dates and associated QR codes. That way I can load up all the addresses in Mycelium and pay the appropriate address each month. I saw an IFTT that adds a received Bitcoin payment straight into a Google Docs spreadsheet. Imagine how easy it would be for a landlord to just open a spreadsheet on a given date, see who has or has not paid and then send out a form letter to those who haven't paid? That actually sounds pretty cool. 
Also, what does your business plan to do in terms of reserves or deposits? Place the funds in an m-of-n with the landlord? Or an escrow company? We always talk about abolishing _everything_ around here. That should include credit scores. With smart contracts and m-of-n signatures, you should be able to do it entirely within the Bitcoin infrastructure.

My family is highly distributed and we'll often gather at resorts for holidays. I can't bring myself to buying into a timeshare because I don't need one at all. I have and earn enough points to last a long time. 
"m-of-n" refers to storing funds in an address that requires more than one signature in order to initiate a transfer. So if you placed funds with an escrow agent, none of the three of you would be able to send the funds anywhere else without at least one other party agreeing to initiate the transfer. 
Either you and the escrow agent will transfer the funds back to you if they agree with you in the event of a dispute or the landlord may convince the escrow agent that they deserve the funds. Of course you and the landlord may agree to send the funds on your own if you don't need mediation. 
M of N refers to a subset of the parties involved coming to an agreement. The example I gave would be 2 of 3 parties. Also works for 3 of 4, and so on.

It is surprisingly easy to remember the 12 words. Unfortunately you do lose all your transaction labels, so it works great as one huge bucket of BTC.

Assuming you're in the US, have you tried signing up at LibertyX.com just to see the process? You may have one of their thousands of retail locations not far from you. They are typically check cashing shops or prepaid cellular providers. You buy some PIN codes from them with cash. Enter the PIN code and your current Bitcoin receive address on your mobile-optimized account page to start receiving BTC immediately. Some of the lightest KYC in the US and instant transfers during business hours. These shops also offer some of the best pricing in the US -- Bitstamp + 0% for the first $1,000; 1% after that. The same approach in the UK -- buying in "top up shops" -- offers some of the worst pricing on Earth.

Be careful here. If you read down you'll see many others taking into account the risk of robbery where a client may force her to empty her wallet. Much better to take deposit QRs on paper, randomly pick one for each John, have him pay the QR while she loads it as a watch only address. She can verify the confirmations right away and is also protected because it's impossible for her to spend without going home to fetch the corresponding private key. This is not a regular Bitcoin transaction scenario and shouldn't be treated as such.

Understanding that the coins are not actually stored on any of your devices or any websites under your login is really important. As was said below, either you store or the website stores on your behalf the right or ability to move balances out of one or more addresses. You don't have to protect the "deposit" addresses -- everyone can see them and that's what you give to others when you want to receive some BTC. It's the "spend" addresses, or private keys, that you protect or trust someone else to protect. 
As for ease of buying, if you're in the US, I recommend you check out LibertyX. They piggyback on bill payment retail stores to make buying Bitcoin work the same way that millions of people across the country pay their utility bills with cash.
You could also walk into numerous banks across the country and (by prior arrangement), deposit cash into someone's account and wait for them to deposit an equivalent amount of Bitcoin into a wallet of your choice.

People are becoming intolerant of having multiple transactions ever occur with the same sending or receiving address.
If you could spend a little time learning how to generate a different (but cryptographically related) donation address each time the user asks how to donate, that would be viewed as a very innovative and unique approach. If it's a PC or console game, you can display a QR but that won't be of much use on mobile. Include a button to copy the donation address to the clipboard so that donors may paste it into their wallet app and send a payment. On your end, running a single HD wallet will allow you to process all donations as they come in without any concern as to which (again, cryptographically related) donation address receives the payment -- they are NOT random -- they are hundreds of thousands of addresses that collectively behave as deposit addresses to your one HD wallet.

Not a good idea in the US if you're planning to be tax compliant. You need to record the date, exchange rate and purchased amount of BTC each time you buy and the same data again each time you spend or sell BTC. 
Then for each little bundle of BTC you need to figure out if it went up or down while you held it, cancel out any gains with losses and then calculate if you earned more than 50c on each bundle of BTC you held. If you did, you need to pay the feds another 23% or 42% on those gains, depending on how long you held the BTC. Imagine your calculations if you had to figure out exactly how much every 75c worth of BTC went up or down when you spend $200 at Amazon.
I find it far easier to buy BTC in larger bundles and place each purchase in its own HD wallet. I name each wallet with the purchase date and exchange rate to make it easy to only spend BTC that has lost a small amount of value since I purchased it. No reporting requirements that way.
Lawnmower sounds like an accounting nightmare to me unless the purchase happens every one to four months. Then it might not be so bad. 
@_date: 2015-09-02 11:41:18
From a BTC perspective, it depends on how you do your accounting, whether or not you need to report it to the government and whether or not you do if you need to. 
Remember, you only need to report your transactions to the feds if you mined the BTC (and it actually had value at the time) or if the BTC you bought and spent increased by more than 50 cents while you held it. So if you buy $40,000 worth of BTC and spend it at or below the purchase price,  you never need to report it.
If you mined it, you were required to report and pay income taxes on the value of the mined BTC all along the way anyway (and a new round of taxes when you spent it, if it went up!) If you mined it years ago at $0, you wouldn't owe back taxes on it, but you would owe 23% capital gains tax on the entire $40,000 once you transacted. That adds nearly $10,000 to the cost of the car.
It is cool having old BTC around mined at $0, but in the US, every $1 of that spent adds another 23c to your tax bill.

No bc.i needed. Just load the payment address as a watch only address in Mycelium. You can immediately see when a payment arrives and when it has been confirmed. You don't want the phone to be setup to be able to send out payments in case of a robbery. Just make a pile of deposit QRs and when you go to receive a payment, load it as a watch only address and hand it over for the John to make a payment. Mycelium is a great way to go. Just don't load it up with any BTC that can be spent under threat of force.
You may even go so far as to delete the Watch Only address after payment has been confirmed in case LE grabs the phone in a sting. There will be nothing left on the phone if Mycelium securely deletes old account details after its been deleted.

Using Electrum on Bootable Tails for example. I memorized my 12 words and I get the same exact sequence of addresses every time I boot up and enter my 12 words. Granted, I did not scroll down and pick a random starting point for my address use. I just picked the first one and I assume many if not most other users do the same. 
That's why I keep saying that you only need to check the first address in the series. Not that it's non zero, but that it ever held a balance. If it never did, then you can eliminate all of the millions of addresses behind it -- unless a lot more people pick a random starting point as you suggest. 
I understand millions is still minuscule in this context, but a million word lists per night eliminating _x_ millions of addresses each greatly reduces your search space. If the first address once held a balance then you know to follow the chain of addresses until you find the last place the change landed. 
Perhaps I still don't have an appreciation for the space involved, but a million word lists per night eliminating millions of addresses each over 15 years is a lot of space marked as searched. Of course you still have to double back and keep rechecking addresses that may have picked up a balance after you checked it last.
Also, if you find a few mBTC don't ignore it because it may be an active wallet that can suddenly get a deposit at any time.
I appreciate you doing the math. That's beyond me. I'm just thinking conceptually.

I will have to sign up at Coinkite to see what it has to offer. I prefer to keep all my BTC purchases in separate HD wallets and name them with the purchase price and date. If Coinkite will allow me to create a bunch of separate HD wallets with my Nano assist with signing all of them, that would be good. I'd start to get nervous about the number of websites and apps that would be needed to authorize a transfer, but I'd still check it out. Multiple named HD wallets on ledgerwallet.com is all I'm looking for for now, though.

Wow, that's painful to read. In the US, we have one of the easiest ways to buy BTC. There is a company that sells BTC in thousands of retailers across the country for cash only. It took me about 5 minutes to sign up and 10 minutes to drive to the nearest participating retailer. You walk in, tell them what you are buying and how much you want, hand them the cash and they hand you a receipt. On that receipt is a PIN code. The person who wants the BTC enters that PIN code into a web site and the Bitcoin address where they want the BTC deposited. Because you pay in cash, the BTC is available immediately. I usually don't leave the store until the transfer starts in Mycelium. 
Fees? 0% for the first $1,000 purchased, 1% after that. Dead serious. There are buying limits, however. $1,000 a day and $2,500 a week, so it would have taken three people to get it done in one day, two people in two days, or your Mom would have had to make two purchases 7 days apart if she did it alone. Of course, buying $2,485 (for $2,500) in two days would already beat the amount lost in the wire transfer, with another $496 (for $500) coming next week. 
Your Mom could have sent you each PIN code for you to claim the BTC using her login or she could likely have done it herself. There are only two fields to complete. If she wanted to do it, you'd have to give her the deposit address to copy and paste into the form if you trusted her to get it right. Easy to do with text messaging. 
I understand the UK has a nearly identical setup with retail stores, but regularly features the worst exchange rates on the planet, not the best. 
In the US, LibertyX is the way to go for small(ish) non investment grade purchases.

I appreciate your note. I should have said that the random words assigned by Electrum actually work as key words in two short sentences, almost like haiku. That made the two halves of the sequence very easy to remember.

Couple interesting things about that one. First, the $149 million it was originally worth has lost $30 million since then. Second, it was (almost) exactly 6.5 BTC short of exactly 195,000 BTC.

I was bored one time and paid 15% for an anonymous, reversible purchase, so it's not the worst I've ever paid, but again it was reversible. I now pay about 2% with Bitwage. You paid way above the norm but maybe not into "ripoff territory".

3) Hand them your cash and they'll print out a receipt
4) Locate a PIN code on the receipt, grab your phone and enter the PIN code on their website along with your Bitcoin receive address
5) Click Sumbit and the transfer starts almost immediately.
Here's the kicker: Bitstamp + 0% for the first $1,000, 1% after that. I believe it's either $1,500 or $2,500 per week limit. I don't know of any vendor or local seller who prices it that low. That's pretty impressive.

I have said this before, but it's been long enough to repeat. I would like to power my SiriusXM satellite radio with it. I would go to the website and configure which package or individual channels I want when the radio is active. That sets a "burn rate". Then, whenever I want my radio activated, I will deposit BTC in the address associated with my radio, and they will activate my radio and consume the deposited BTC according to the burn rate I selected when I configured the channel lineup associated with that radio. 
I normally drive my car for 4 hours a week -- 1 hour each way to and from the airport and 2 hours at the most while I'm home on the weekends. I spend way too much on the service while my car sits in an airport parking lot all week (although I do use the app on my phone as well).

First, if you run Bitcoin Core your computer already knows every address that has a balance. Second, you can start attacking the address space by trying random 12 word seeds and looking for collisions. Of course, you can't just look for a non-zero balance in the first address. Even zero balances could have held a balance at some point in the past, so if it has ever held a balance, just traverse further down the generated key list and you'll likely find where the balance sits right now. Don't just attack the complete keyspace, that's nuts -- attack the HD space instead by trying random word combinations. Each iteration generates millions of addresses -- far more efficient.

LibertyX sells BTC in thousands of retail locations across the US for cash only. Because you paid in cash, they know your side is done and they can release the BTC into your wallet immediately. Transfers normally start before I leave the store. $1,000/day or $2,500/wk limits.  
It's also important to many people that they transfer the BTC into any address you designate, not a web wallet they built for you. You have BTC in your wallet not an IOU, and they can't shut down your wallet or force you to cash out because they don't like where you or someone downstream from you eventually sent some BTC they sold to you.

Remember, with their new policy you still have 24 hours to float your rate and transfers are instant to a REAL wallet. Can't get that anywhere else. It's like going to a meetup on LBC and telling the seller "I'll pay you cash right now, but don't transfer the BTC to me until I call you to lock in the price sometime over the next 24 hours. And you better send it to me the instant I tell you to and at the going rate at that moment in time -- not when I paid you."

I think this is the crux of how we're approaching it from different directions. You seem to base your points on addresses whereas my focus is on the word lists.


Again, you're focusing on a million single addresses. I'm thinking a million 12 word lists generated per night. Each one would then be used to generate the first address in the sequence which will then be checked to see if it ever held a balance. If it did, it's the leader of what at least one point was an active HD wallet. I'm not thinking about storing millions of addresses generated by a million word lists per night. I'm only thinking of storing a million 12 word lists a night. 12 words by average 5 letters by one million or ~~60~~ 71MB a night total. As you traverse the database, you generate the first address for each given word list and check to see if it ever held a balance. If it did, copy the word list to another database . If it did not, move on and check the first address generated by the next word list.
It appears I'm taking less of a purist view than you are. I'm not aiming to hit every single address. I'm using a non-numeric approach to take the fewest number of shots at the largest part of the field. If most people are using the first generated address in the list, then you'll quickly knock out huge swaths of addresses that likely never held a balance. To your earlier point, perhaps check the first 10 or 20 addresses for a random starting point.
I am by no means talking about generating millions of addresses and checking them one at a time. Moving to soft figures, what small actions could yield the greatest number of addresses that are "likely" to hold a balance? Check the first address from a million word lists to see if each one ever held a balance. If it did, the change is likely somewhere down the line. Don't bother generating any additional addresses until you get a hit on the first one (hit being it was *ever* used). See the difference in our approach? You seem to go right for the addresses pretty quickly whereas I prefer to figure out which ones are worth calculating before expending the resources to do it.

I see it like a self-managing prepaid phone account. I load up BTC into an address that uniquely controls whether or not my radio can be activated. Then I choose the channels I want to receive and whether or not the radio is activated. Whenever I activate it, they slowly drain the BTC out of my radio's address into their main accounts. Whenever I deactivate it via the app or website, they send a deactivation signal and stop depleting the BTC in my radio's address. If I cancel completely I will specify where I'd like for them to send the unspent BTC. 
I'm not paying my radio, per se. I'm still paying the service provider but I'm using the app or web site (and balance of the specific address) to customize my channel lineup and specify whether or not the radio is activated. Ultimately, I would leave it set as activated, but turn it on or off by depositing enough BTC for each span of a couple days or couple weeks that I want it to actually work. Need it for the weekend? $1. Taking a two week road trip? $7. 
So long as there's BTC in the address linked to my radio and I want it activated, it'll keep running and they can deplete whatever 50c/day costs per hour or per half hour or per 15 minutes.

The auction only limit is for use with their daily auctions. Buyers continuously bid to purchase a certain amount of BTC at a certain price. At 4pm New York time, Gemini fills as many orders as they can using the best price to volume match they can find. Then the bidding for the next day resumes 1 hour later at 5pm New York time. We were seeing the 4pm volume and price in here for the first week or so, but I think that died off.

I'm 15 years from retirement. I have a few pre and post tax investment plans. I'm also accumulating BTC and I doubt I'm going to need to touch my retirement savings.

Oh man that's a great rate if it works out. The PIN stores normally work much better than the QPay stores. Keep in mind that if you need to send a specific amount in BTC, always buy a little more to cover any fees and fluctuation. We've been riding a a pretty good climb this last half week or so, so don't go in there thinking you're going to get $150 when you give them $150 in cash -- it just doesn't work like that.
Between fees and any corrections that may be coming shortly, you may ultimately spend $160-170 to get that $150 in BTC by the time you're ready to spend it and have $5 or so left over. That's okay, though, you can throw $1 into the hat in next month's drawing over in r/millionairemakers!

Check out Proof of Burn. Some people would trade BTC for a new coin by sending BTC to a "provably unspendable address". So many people focus on 21 million coins and figuring out the exact total number that can ever exist but you never hear about coins that were intentionally sent to addresses without a known private key. That's a horrible way to spend BTC, IMHO.

I know you and go at it all the time, mostly (but not always!) as friendly competition.

I think you guys definitely got the ball rolling in terms of pushing thinking in the right direction, but I *really* like the way the Nano fits on my keychain. I'm fine with the remote screen on my phone. If you go back through my history, you'll see that I refused to activate my Nano until they delivered on their promise to make it happen. promised it to me back in January at TNABC so I bought it on faith. It was either going to complete fully with your product or it was going in the trash. All the arguing about stickers and packaging also has me happy that I didn't need to worry about it.
Don't get me wrong, I will always appreciate what you guys did in this space, but this is one case where I prefer their approach to the technology and packaging (the device, not the box it came in!)

I think wesellcrypto will do the sale for you. Keep in mind that you can reverse your PayPal payment months later and take your money back yet they can never reverse the Bitcoin payment once it goes through. That means you should expect to pay very high rates to complete the transaction. BTC is at $713 on BitStamp right now, so don't be surprised to see $800 for PayPal.

Pretty sad, actually. I started working in IT at a university in '92 and was even reading alt.crypto on USENET back then. I eventually "went corporate" and even had my desk on a datacenter floor from '97 to '00. I was all over Slashdot back then with a low UID. Then I got a flashy new job as a virtualization architect at Big Blue and got out of the nerdy stuff.
In late 2013, my 68 year old mother-in-law read about it in the New Yorker and asked me to print out a paper wallet for her to put in her currency collection. I did, and the more I read about it, the more shocked I was that I missed the whole birth of it.
I was in between gigs and had all day to study it when the FinCEN and IRS rulings and guidance were first coming out. I watched the MTGOX debacle unfold minute-by-minute. I watched the NY state hearings live and watched BitLicense unfold. I finally got a long term gig in South Florida in time to attend NABC in Miami. I bought my Nano directly from the hands of the Ledger CEO and also bought a book assembling all of Satoshi's writings.
Now I'm a happy BitWage customer and get all my travel expenses reimbursed in BTC.

GPU mining earns pennies per year and costs you about $60/mo in electricity. Also, mining pools have minimum amounts that you must earn before they pay you, so you could wait years before they finally pay you 25 cents.

@_date: 2015-04-29 00:48:57
No it isn't. It would take years to earn a penny, and the places where you could earn it require you to earn more than that before they'll ever pay you. We encourage you to study it and learn the concepts behind it, but understand that you cannot do it with a PC anymore. 
If you spend $400 on specialized equipment and $300/mo on electricity, you'd earn about $20-30 per month in Bitcoin. Spend a lot, get a little.

There's also my old favorite low tech way for replacing the donation cans at convenience stores: generate 100 Load &amp; Verify QRs from the same HD wallet and place them in a loop on a simple digital picture frame. Then just put the frame on a random loop. Chances are very slim that any two shoppers will make a payment to the same QR. No need to sweep as they're already in the HD wallet from the beginning.
In my original example laid out about a year ago, I put a new QR after every four pictures of animals. Again, low tech, but it gets the job done. No one can steal the coin can and you just need to replace the batteries every week or two.

Yes. That's the biggest PITA about BTC in the US. When you sell, spend, or trade any crypto for fiat or another crypto, you are responsible for reporting and paying tax on any gains you made on the portion you no longer hold. Doesn't matter why you don't have it anymore. You enjoyed gains on it, so you pay tax on the gains.
I start a new HD wallet for each purchase named for the purchase price, so I know when I'm flat or down a little before each spend. I'm not flat or down anywhere right now, so I'm hodling.
Now if someone mined in high school, held all the way through college and bought a Maserati as a graduation gift, they will then owe an extra 23% of the price of that car the following April. Basically, all of the BTC acquired through mining had a cost basis of 0, making the entire purchase price capital gains.
The primary way to avoid paying tax on the gains is by donating it to a qualifying charity.
Note that as best I can tell, this doesn't apply if you live in Puerto Rico. No capital gains tax on assets acquired after moving there and becoming a bona fide resident. Act 22 sure reads like you can move there, get recognized as a resident, and then daytrade tax-free. I'm still reading and watching videos to validate this theory.
@_date: 2016-10-22 19:18:17
In the US, you are required to declare income from mining on your income taxes as well as any realized gains. That means you declare for the purpose of capital gains once you sell a holding if the asset increased in value by more than 50c while you held it.
Note that this is not limited to exchanging to USD. This is true any time you change cryptos. Put it this way, you cannot swap back and forth between BTC and altcoins until you build up $1 million worth and not expect to pay taxes on the gains until you sell it for fiat.
Every time you change between coins to fiat or any other coin you need to declare and pay if your holdings increased more than 50c while you held them.
I buy and hold and I setup a different HD wallet each time I buy and I label the wallet with the cost basis. That way it is easy to tell exactly how much I gained or lost whenever I spent and I also know if I have any BTC that is safe to spend -- e.g. was bought at or above the current market price. If I don't have any that is safe to spend, I either pass up on spending it or hit up a LibertyX  to get some fresh BTC at current prices. I've also recently signed up at BitWage, so I will be getting fresh BTC every couple of weeks. I will have BTC at a wide variety of prices soon enough.

They are a quirky bunch. After my initial application, they said there were "inconsistencies" with my ID data and needed a second batch. That was total horseshit in that I'm a grown man twice their age and I'd know if there were inconsistencies.

@_date: 2015-09-14 12:38:25
I'm experimenting with running Electrum on TAILS. It's only an experiment so I don't have a lot of BTC in there. Just a small token transaction. TAILS is a customized version of Linux that is designed to be identity protecting. Part of that involves running EVERYTHING over Tor. As was discussed again recently in here, that is inherently unsafe when you are exiting Tor before hitting the Electrum server. You are not supposed to trust the exit nodes.
So to combat that, look for services that exist only inside the Tor network. Here's an example Electrum server that resides inside the network which, as I understand it, is much safer than hitting Electrum after a Tor exit node. When taking down SR, I thought interested parties had deduced that some TLAs have infiltrated Tor, but I don't know to what extent. 
Do with this as you wish, but there are people hosting Electrum servers as hidden Tor services.

Mycelium started out as a great wallet on Android and the dev team has been working hard at integrating with other partners. They make it very easy to watch your balances and make deposits while requiring you to insert a physical device in order to spend. Plus, if you have Galaxy S6 or Note 5 or higher, you can download an app that will turn a hardened section of your phone into one of those hardware wallets that are compatible with Mycelium.

Mycelium for Android. It was a great wallet from the beginning and it already supports tight integration with the best hardware wallets.
Also, you don't want to spend the least in fees when sending. You want to send the appropriate amount for the conditions at the time. I never take mine off Normal and you have never seen me asking why it's taking 6 hours for a confirmation.
@_date: 2016-10-19 12:33:30
If you're in the US, check out LibertyX. Go to liberty.com/locations and see if any stores are near you. Once you sign up for an account, you can walk into any of the stores in their system. You walk into a store, pay cash and the BTC typically starts transferring before you leave the store.
If you go to a store that uses the "old method", you tell them you want to buy LibertyX from their gift card machine. They ask how much you want in increments of $50. They print up a slip and sell it to you for the cash amount. The slip contains a PIN code which you enter in their app along with the Bitcoin address where you want the balance transferred. The transfer begins immediately.
If you go to a store that uses the "new method", you pull up the app and start a purchase. You copy and paste the Bitcoin address where you want the deposit to go and click submit. A PIN code will show up on your phone. You then tell the cashier how much you want to buy (down to the penny, but leave room for fees). You give them the cash and show them the PIN code. They enter the PIN on a laptop or other device and again, since they already have the cash from you, the transfer starts immediately and goes directly into the address you specified.
It can be Mycelium, Bread, Jaxx, a paper wallet, or an address managed by someone anywhere on Earth it doesn't matter. The worst thing you can do, though, is give a Coinbase or Blockchain deposit address. That defeats the whole purpose.
No, you can't use them to sell BTC or swap into another crypto. They take the UNIX mentality to selling BTC. Focus on one small thing and do it cleanly, do it well. I've since moved on to BitWage who does basically the same thing -- simple, clean purchases -- but using a slice of my paycheck.
If you just want to buy BTC and deposit straight into a real wallet you control, check out LibertyX. Be sure to watch the fees, though, they can vary pretty wildly from store to store -- like 1% to 12.5%. The last time I bought from them, I literally slid $300 under the bulletproof glass in the cellphone store and got $270 in BTC deposited in my wallet. Ouch. Each store is very upfront about fees. Just pay attention, that's all.
Oh, and if you like their model but can't find any stores near you, they'll pay you $100 for each store you get added to their network! They'll even set you up with paperwork you can leave with the store owner.

Changetip makes it easy to exchange crypto with other users on social media like Reddit by using a simple set of words in your comment. Think of it as turbo charging your likes. Instead of just saying, "Cool!" you can actually buy that person a cup of coffee or a beer. 
~~You can also just buy your $5 worth right inside the Changetip interface, too. Nice and easy.~~ Not anymore.  
Finally, PayPal has long been used to rip off Bitcoin sellers, so if you continue down that path, expect to pay a much higher cost for your BTC than the rest of us. You can take your money back with PayPal, but if the seller legitimately transferred the BTC to you, they can't take it back. Your offer to buy that way is seen as very risky in this community.
@_date: 2016-10-17 17:28:30
They are very safe. I agree with the general sentiment about how much you should be willing to carry around, but understand that there are a few major differences between these and paper cash.
I use Mycelium for Android. I have setup a PIN so while anyone who can get onto my phone can launch the app and check my balances, they will need to know my PIN to do anything like send BTC.
If my phone were to get stolen, I usually travel with one or two spare backup phones ready to be activated in case of an emergency. There is nothing stopping me from installing another copy of Mycelium on my backup phone and using the same seed words to quickly regain control of my funds.
Say I have two spares. Another phone and a tablet that I wasn't carrying when I got robbed. The phone is configured with the same seed words as the one that got stolen and Mycelium is not loaded on the tablet. I'll install Mycelium on the tablet and let it use a different set of seed words. I'll pull up Mycelium on my backup phone and make sure that all of the HD wallets I created on my primary phone have also been generated on my backup phone.
Then I will turn to the tablet (again, running on a completely different set of seed words), and generate all new HD wallets, one for one, to replace those created under the old seed words. I will then traverse the list of HD wallets, transferring my balances from each original HD wallet into the corresponding new one, until all of the legacy wallets have been emptied.
So even if the thief somehow got past my screen lock password and knew what Mycelium was, they still likely wouldn't get past my PIN code to spend any of the balances. While they tried to figure out what to do with it, they would start seeing all of the balances across all of my HD wallets suddenly start dropping to 0, one after the other. That's me moving my funds to another copy of Mycelium and out of the reach of the stolen phone.
So it goes way beyond the concept of "how much are you willing to have stolen?" They are very safe and when paired up with hardware wallets, reach into the extreme levels of safety. If you wanted to, you could put a small device -- let's call it a digital key -- on your keyring. You can always see your balances right on your phone. But when you go to spend, you need to pull out this digital key and insert it into an adapter that's plugged into the USB port on your phone. Then you'll still have to type in a password to authorize the transaction. That's not off in the future or on some roadmap -- that technology exists today.
It sounds like a lot of work when you go to spend BTC, but think about the chances of someone knowing that to get to your BTC, they'll need your phone, your keychain AND your password or PIN to use to authorize the transaction. Infinitesimally small.

With all the crap we've heard about in here over the years with banks closing accounts associated with Bitcoin activities, I didn't want to risk it. When I bought on demand, I used LibertyX. Cash only and no web wallets.
Now that I'm a little more serious, I switched one of my two direct deposit streams to BitWage, again keeping my primary bank completely out of the loop. On the upside, BitWage charges if you want any amount of your direct deposit forwarded to another account in fiat. I don't need that service, so every week or two, I'm buying at about 2%.

Something I will likely never do. I consider that a holdout from the old days. I do my Ledger work on my corporate laptop and Mycelium on my corporate phone, both of which have extreme levels of protection.
Granted, there's no way I would use Mycelium on a rooted phone, and would probably start using my Ledger in Mycelium on a personal phone if I lose my corporate assets, but I'm not moving to an offline computer when the top class in hardware wallet security is available for way less than $50.
For absolute paranoia, I have also memorized a word list in Electrum on TAILS, but I haven't put anything out there. But offline computer? No thanks. People normally suggest an old laptop they have sitting around, which is the worst thing you can do since it is probably old and prone to failure.

I have some in the $1,600's that I'd like to shapeshift into Ether without incurring capital gains if we'll ever see that price again. All of my holdings are currently locked because the tax from spending, selling or shapeshifting them will be too high.
If we see a crash across the board affecting all cryptos, there's a bunch I will shift into ETH and maybe even ETC for the cherry on top. None of this is going away for good. I don't need it to be worth anything for another 10 years, and even if it's flat at that time, I still have my "plan A".

Yeah you can definitely go down a rabbit hole if you decide to start playing the exchanges against each other in arbitrage. I used LibertyX before switching to Bitwage, and both tend to anchor their prices against Bitstamp. It's just what I grew up on :)
Now with Bitcoin Paranoid installed, you may see a green up arrow or red down arrow in your notification area. They indicate significant (and configurable) price movements. Unfortunately, the exact wording of the notification is off, so you'll see a weird notification like
BTC up 6% (from $0.23) 2 days ago to $609.42
It obviously didn't climb from 23 cents, but you get the point. Up x% in y hours or days to a new recent high or low. That was how I learned of the last hack. Had two red arrows. Major crash. Came here to see wtf happened.

Aside from the answer you already received, I only implied the era and therefore value of the coins at the time they were mined, but wasn't specific enough: very early on, and therefore 0. No income tax at the time and cost basis 0 since the it was very early on in the life of Bitcoin. Also, being a young teenager in my example, they also likely didn't have any expenses such as electricity nor did they likely setup a business to handle such expenses. 
Kid mines early on for tons of $0 BTC and spends a bunch of it years later at the original $1,142 high. Massive long term capital gains tax.

Don't worry you do have the private keys. Keep in mind that Mycelium uses an HD wallet by default, so a string of words is used to generate a new private key / public address pair after each transaction (send or receive). With your Account open, bring up the menu and choose Backup. You will write down a series of words, type them back in to prove that you wrote them down correctly and then store them in a very safe place -- one where no one else will find them by accident, yet will be able to get to them in case of your death. If you lose your phone, you simply install Mycelium on your next device and choose Restore Wallet at install. Re-enter the words you wrote down and all of your keys and addresses (and your respective balances) will return.
Any nicknames (tags) you apply to your wallet names or individual transactions will not be restored, however.
Finally, with your Mycelium up, touch on the QR for "Receive funds" and copy the deposit address to the clipboard. Either paste it into Coinbase or email it to the PC where you do your Coinbase transactions. Send your Coinbase balance to the Receive address shown by Mycelium and your funds will start to come over. You really should get in the habit of using a different address for each transaction, so make sure to grab a new address before initiating each transfer if you have BTC sitting in multiple places. You may wish to do what I did and empty your ChangeTip account into Mycelium first just to get a feel for the process. Again, get your (current) deposit address from Mycelium (it changes after every transaction) and then on the My Money page at ChangeTip, initiate a withdrawal to the deposit address you got from Mycelium. If you have a few dollars in ChangeTip, practice sending small amounts back and forth between the two systems. It's free to withdraw from ChangeTip and only costs a couple cents to deposit back into ChangeTip straight from Mycelium.
There are numerous advanced capabilities of Mycelium -- these instructions are just to get your funds transferred and protected.

I took it slowly when learning at first as well.
This is not a very secure way to do it, but it is by far the easiest and takes no time at all and is great way to get over the hump while risking just a few cents.
Go to bitaddress.org, click in the text box and start hitting random keys on the keyboard while moving the mouse around randomly. Keep doing this until the percentage shown reaches 100%. Once you see a new screen, click Paper Wallet up top and you will see three images. Print that page and cut out the three images. They are roughly the size of paper money.
Now fold them in two places horizontally to create three equally sized panels. The Load and Verify panel is supposed to be visible out front, the middle panel hidden behind the Load and Verify panel and the Spend panel is to be hidden by the other two panels folded over top of it. When folded, they fit perfectly in a photo slot in your regular wallet in your pocket.
Now you can put 25 cents' worth of BTC on one. Then go to blockchain.info and enter the Load and Verify address in the search field. You will eventually see the transaction you made to put the balance on it.
It is very easy to learn without risking a lot of money. If you have an Android phone, we can show you how easy it is to spend from that paper wallet. In the meantime, just start by printing one out and loading a few cents on it.

I believe Airbitz follows the same standard as Mycelium and Electrum 2, so you should be able to enter your seed words into Airbitz and gain immediate access to and full control of your BTC.
Because your seed words generate thousands (millions?) of key and address pairs and you never know when someone might send you funds on one of your earlier addresses, you really want to avoid trying to convert your seed words into an actual list if possible. You want an app that listens for transactions on all your keys.
Also, keep in mind that with Electrum, you are also free to run one of their mid tier servers. You can host your own private intermediary directly to the Blockchain. Setting up your own Electrum server will likely get you up and running with all functionality restored faster than extracting and importing a list of key pairs potentially with millions of rows (assuming Airbitz doesn't actually accept your Mycelium and Electrum seed words).

Thank you for this. I will be interested in seeing if the signature verification moves the visual inspection from human to machine by asking me to submit several handwriting samples -- or even worse, gets them off receipts that have been submitted. My signature varies WILDLY and can often appear to represent just one full phase of a sine wave resting on the signature line. Similarly when signing last night, the digitizer was all screwed up and my signature looked like a DNA double helix with a bunch of [broken chromosomes]( in it. I would hope that wouldn't pass, but who knows.

My wife and I had coffee on Tampa's "Bitcoin Blvd" about two weeks after the Bitcoin Bowl college football game was held nearby. During the run up to the game, BitPay ran around the city, signing up stores and vendors. That was my first ever purchase with BTC and it very much felt like "Bitcoin has finally made it". We could see the stadium from the little table where we were sitting and many of the participating stores had "Bitcoin Bowl" stickers on their windows. They were actually supposed to close 45 minutes before we arrived, but when they heard we had basically come from Philly they gladly served us and rang it up with BitPay on an iPad.
That was a cool day.

Actually, now that you mention it, I believe an Act 20 business needs to be based in PR but provide services off the island, such as a consultancy to clients in the mainland. So scratch my idea about owning a bunch of properties. Your business could own the properties and then teach people how to move to PR, trade crypto, and profit enough to buy properties!
I'm more interested in Act 22, myself. Move there. Get approved for Act 22. Start buying crypto and shapeshift your way to millions. Spend it with Gyft. Convince local businesses to accept it since they don't have the capital gains complications either. Perhaps convince some real estate sellers to accept BTC for houses and land.

You only need the private key. You never see the public key. The string value you see and can safely share is a hash of the public key, called the Bitcoin address. All wallets will generate the Bitcoin address from the private key. 
In a perfect world, you will never come into contact with the actual private key. Only words that when listed together in a specific order will generate a virtually unlimited sequence of private keys (and therefore Bitcoin addresses) designed to be used one after the other.

Thank you for stopping by to vouch for the page, much appreciated. It seems the "Donate" link at the top leads to your off-site donation page, complete with the Bitcoin link, while the "Donate" link at the bottom of your pages leads to your /join page. If there's anyone who wants some level of anonymity, I would think it would be someone who is donating to an organization dedicated to holding government accountable for their actions. This is one of those times where it would be great to have a web application that takes your HD seed words and only generates a list of safe addresses from it. Some of us brainstormed about it a week or so ago.
Consider one of my ideas, for example: use a script that takes your HD seed word list and generates 10,000 deposit-only Bitcoin addresses (no private keys). Then run those addresses through a utility that generates QR codes from those deposit addresses. Finally, whenever someone visits your /bitcoin page, show them a random QR code from the many thousands stored in a directory. You don't ever need to place private keys anywhere near your web server and donors will enjoy some level of protection based thanks to the randomness in your display script. You could even do it with client side scripting -- send the browser a random address from your collection and have the browser generate the code, just like on BitAddress.org.
Finally, and this will not be popular, you may wish to check out how the Wikimedia Foundation uses Coinbase to process donations. There was quite a backlash here when it seems Coinbase applied their standard KYC/AML rules to the donation page as people just wanted to donate Bitcoin straight to the foundation. It may make your lives much simpler in the end, but it may also cause some consternation among a rather vocal minority.
tl;dr Thanks for validating its legitimacy, but you may wish to do a lot more than adding a link in your CSS to a plain, single deposit address. It's a start, though!

I don't purport to be an expert in just about anything myself :) In fact, when I invoked the "left hand/right hand" problem, my original intent was to discuss how FinCEN decided that Bitcoin exchanges (and high volume personal exchangers) need to register as a Money Services Business followed shortly by the IRS declaring Bitcoins as property instead of a foreign currency.
One group with a law enforcement arm declares it as something like a financial instrument while another group also with a law enforcement arm declares it as property and not a currency.
When it comes to tracking BTC back and forth between owners, yeah, the feds love the blockchain. When it comes to everything else about it, I can see how they hate it. It completely undermines a major focus of the federal government and federal reserve.

Totally different purpose. It is designed to give you some Satoshis that you can use as tokens. Data points on the blockchain for you to attach smart contracts or to associate with ownership for physical or digital items.
This is not the "spend $1,000 plus $400/mo to earn $75/mo" kind of miner. It's a "spend $400 so you can link ownership of a few hundred things to a few hundred Satoshis" kind of miner. A Satoshi is 1/100 000 000 of a BTC.

Ehh, there are IRS rules around commingling BTC. It affects the cost basis of the entire wallet and it also affects which BTC you spent according to FIFO or LIFO. If you're going to spend BTC that went up in value, you're going to pay two different tax rates based upon how long you held it -- either 365 days or less or 366 days or days or more. The tax rate on the gains drops significantly on day 366.  
Now if you choose LIFO and buy a big chunk to start, it will "sit at the bottom" while newer BTC comes and goes off the "top". Picture a single, multicolored bar in a bar chart. At the bottom is the oldest BTC, and as you make your way up the bar you are approaching the newest BTC added to the wallet. If you go to buy a $200 hard drive, you may be lulled into thinking "Cool, I have $250 in my wallet" when in reality you have $10 purchased a week ago, $75 purchased last month, $15 purchased a few months ago, $35 purchased before that, $25 purchased almost a year ago, and the last $40 you need for that hard drive purchased over a year ago.
All in one wallet, you have six different cost bases for the BTC that is going into the purchase, four that went up in value, two that dropped in value and also two different tax rates on those that went up, assuming one of the four that increased in value was purchased over a year ago. You have to figure out how much money you earned on each of the four groups of BTC that increased in value while you held it, determine how long you held each grouping, and pay either 42 or 23 cents of every dollar earned in each group, depending on whether or not you held the BTC for over a year. If your records cannot convince the IRS that you separated your holdings and can verify how long you held each BTC before spending it, they may eliminate your claim to lower tax rates on gains or even worse, may disregard your assertion that you lost money on certain transactions.
See what kind of a disaster that is? Sadly, that is the actual current state of tax reporting for BTC use in the US. Bitcoin is property in the US, not a currency, and this outcome is the ramification of that decision. That is why I create a new wallet each time I buy BTC and tag it with the exchange rate and date of purchase. That is also why I only spend BTC from wallets where I'm losing money. Sure, I could take a few dollars off my income statement to reduce my overall tax bill, but it is so not worth it. You're only required to report every gain over 50c. You're not required to report any losses, although you could be giving up a good bit of money if your BTC lost a lot of value before you spent it.
I do not recommend mixing BTC bought on different dates with different exchange rates. Instead, start a new wallet each time you acquire BTC and label it with the date and exchange rate. When you go to spend BTC, check the current exchange rate first and spend BTC that was bought at a slightly higher rate than the current rate. Then tag each transaction with a purpose, amount in USD and exchange rate. For example "Coffee at Duffys $5.25 @ 295". That way I can prove that I always spend BTC at a loss, no matter what. If the rate takes off and I'm up on every wallet (like today), I'll stop by a LibertyX location, buy another $100 at current rates and start a new wallet tagged with the purchase date and exchange rate. The rates should go back down soon, unlocking the funds and allowing me to spend again without all the complications.

Are you guys clear on the fact that mining nets those who find a block both new BTC AND the fees that are attached to every transaction mined into a block? Satoshi's goal was to start out with high amounts of BTC created per block and gradually replace that over time with transaction fees. 
If Bitcoin was to be successful to last long enough, he figured that it would likely be worth so much that the transaction fees alone would serve as a suitable replacement for the new BTC that was still being created in "the old days". 
As the value of BTC rises and the number of transactions rise, the amount of new BTC being created drops, but the miners will continue to be incentivized by the transaction fees.
It's a beautiful system.

Message signing is not a blockchain related event if that's what you're thinking. A signed message will still traverse whatever networks and apps you are currently using to send text-based messages. Email. Reddit subs. Wherever you post text you can post a signed message.
Be careful in how you interpret the presence and verification of a signed message. The fact that someone sent or posted a signed message that verified successfully does nothing to prove that the person who claims to be the author signed it. It just means that one of the one or more people who control that private key digitally signed the message.
That is why it is important to include custom or specifically requested text inside the signed portion of a message. Anyone can send you a signed message with generic text like, "Hey, it's me" inside the signed area and it will verify. But if you ask them to include some text and they also include their name, that improves the chances that they are in control of a key. "This is moronmonday526 and you asked me to write qwertyuiop in my message". That is a far more interesting message to sign. 
If you have an Android, install Mycelium, generate a single use address, select that address from the Accounts tab and select "Sign a Message" from the 3-dot menu. Enter the text you want to certify comes from that address and it will be copied to your clipboard along with extra text that can be used to prove it came from someone who controls the key to that address.
Note that I never said "exclusive". It does nothing to prove that no one else has that key. The more useful information included in the guaranteed portion of the message, the more useful it is for verifying authenticity.

That clears it up, thank you. Over here, businesses (particularly medical facilities) will photocopy your health insurance card and your driver's license and be done with it. The last time I needed to show a piece of mail addressed to me was in order to get a library card when I was 14 about 30 years ago. I wasn't getting a license for 3 more years so I had no other way to prove that I lived within the library's service area. Once I got a license, that was it.
If you want to do some interesting reading, check out how the State of New Jersey responded to 9/11 by upping the proof of identity [requirements]( when obtaining a driver's license. Perhaps that's why we put so much trust in licenses -- businesses know the steps you have to go through to get it. NJ is about the worst when it comes to that, but generally speaking a driver's license is enough over here.
Getting back to our context here, I use LibertyX to buy my BTC in cash at small retailers where you would normally top up your prepaid mobile. I had to register online and enter my license details. No photos, no waiting days for a deposit or an eventual cancellation notice. If you're close enough to a store, you can register and start buying up to $1,000 a day in BTC in less than 10 minutes.

While writing my initial reply, I was considering an alternative solution.
Setup a small digital picture frame and load it with the biggest SD card you can find. Load up about 100,000 pictures that is actually just a rotation of about 25 rescued dogs interspersed with 2,625 different "Donate now with Bitcoin" pictures displaying a QR code. Set the frame to change pictures every 10 seconds and you'll have enough pictures to rotate among 25 different QR codes a week for six months. The key is to write a script that pulls from the dog pictures and the pile of QR codes and copies them into a folder with new file names to ensure the order that they display on the frame.
    dog1.jpg
    dog2.jpg
    donate1.jpg
    dog3.jpg
    dog4.jpg
    donate2.jpg
I realize this does not alpha sort properly, I was just showing the intent.
Even though the "donate now" picture will be every second or third picture shown, no one will notice that the QR codes are actually different.
Since Bitcoin is predicated on no one guessing the same two private keys, I would bet that the chances of any two people donating to the same QR code in the rotation are equally slim.
Low tech but it still likely solves the problem without requiring an Internet connection.  Hell, in 2015 I doubt you still need to change to an entirely new set of QR codes each week. You may be able to rotate through a set of 100 and never get a donation to the same one twice. The "25 new codes each week" was likely overkill.

My pleasure, and thanks for the bits.
Nick is always one of the frontrunners when it comes to trying to figure out who Satoshi really was. The others who are often mentioned may have proposed their own digital currency, but when you look at Nick's library, you can see the foundations of so many topics that were touched upon by Bitcoin.
Not only had he previously proposed a digital currency called BitGold, he asked if anyone wanted to help him code up another one before disappearing for four months and reappearing right before Bitcoin was released. He also made grammatical changes to a three year old essay one day before Bitcoin was announced. He even once wrote that he believed he had finally perfected maintaining anonymity behind a false identity on the Internet!
As you make your way through his library, think about how each paper can be tied to Bitcoin. One of my favorites is the scripting language he proposed to automate the coding and analysis of legal contracts. How often do you hear about smart contracts being the killer app for the Blockchain? All the time.  And yet, somehow, Satoshi had never heard of Nick's work before it was mentioned that he should check it out. _Really?_
Hope you find some good material in there. There's plenty to be found.

Thank you for the link. I see it is tied to signing up with a specific provider for processing. I wonder how much they are without a service agreement. You shouldn't need to go to an external provider to verify a chip &amp; PIN scenario since the entire verification occurs within and between the inserted card and the keypad-bearing terminal.
This, of course, is ignoring the fact that ~~the whole system has been hacked~~ terminals are typically designed so poorly that it is apparently trivial to insert a cloned card that will verify with any PIN.

This comes up a lot around here. Give them to your lawyer with instructions to be released upon your death. No one has to know anything until you die. Or you can be upfront about it and use Shamir's Secret Sharing algorithm where a few family members share pieces of it, but no one can unlock it all until the lawyer releases his portion of the secret.

Holy crap that was a good deal. I bought my Nano directly from the CEO at the Miami conference in 2014, so that's a cool story, but I don't have the whitepaper in the passport format. I keep thinking about printing it on demand at Staples or Amazon if I can get them to do it.
@_date: 2016-10-06 23:06:43
This is not everyday life, but I used it in r/millionairemakers. The point of the sub is to leave a top level comment in the monthly drawing thread. Then the mods run a script that selects a winner from the entries. Everyone who enters agrees to send $1 to the winner. They can't collect the money ahead of time because that would make it an illegal lottery. They literally rely upon the goodness of man. To donate money after it has been proven that the entrant will not receive any money. You can imagine how well that goes. 
Anyway, when I was actively playing, i would get a single use address for each entry, put a little over $1 in it to allow for fluctuations, and then post some digitally signed text as my official entry. That way anyone can see that I funded my donation before I entered and if I ever won later on they could see that I donated to all past winners. 
Unfortunately hardly anyone donates and no one cares when winners can't or won't prove that they donated as promised whenever they played previously. 
I did it all within Mycelium, too. Nice and easy.
@_date: 2015-03-01 16:16:05
Mycelium for Android already does that. Go into Accounts, click the Key with the + up top. Then click Advanced, enter your PIN code and finally click Scan. Scan the "Load &amp; Verify" QR not the Spend QR. When asked, change the name of the wallet from today's date to the purpose of the wallet (car, house, dinner, etc). I typically name my wallets with the exchange rate when I bought that particular BTC. Then I only spend from wallets when the current exchange rate is below the rate at which I bought. This guarantees I never have any taxable gains and therefore reportable events. 
Once you load up and rename your load addresses, Mycelium will show you the balance of each individual wallet address and count their balances in your overall totals all without putting your private key at risk. That's called a "watch only" address and most wallet apps support that function.
As a side note, commingling BTC that was bought on different dates and different cost bases can make things very messy from an accounting and tax reporting perspective. Unless you keep great records outside of the app, you may wish to create a new wallet for each BTC purchase. When you eventually spend it, you must be able to prove how much each Satoshi cost you when you bought it and you will lose money if it went up in value while you held it you can't prove that you held it longer than a year. There's a real benefit to keeping together all BTC that was bought at once and knowing how much all BTC cost when you bought it and when you spent or sold it. The IRS doesn't take "I dunno &lt;shrug&gt;" too well if you don't have those answers. I keep bundles of BTC bought together and always spend the bundles at a (slight) loss.
tl;dr You are already using the best tool for the job, but you may wish to split up your BTC purchases for tracking reasons. Piling in more BTC each week into a single address at a different cost basis will likely come back to bite you the April after you spend it.

Nice. I carry my Ledger Nano on my keychain. It's smaller than the rest of my keys. I can't wait for "Production quality" Ledger support in Mycelium or Chrome for Android via OTG. I believe it already works with Greenaddress.
@_date: 2015-03-30 09:03:47
Very strange that in your example you chose to suggest that Chrome Extensions which is locally installed software may "go down" as opposed to a website. 
That being said, if your Trezor is suddenly unavailable due to their website being unavailable, you could always enter your seed words in an app that follows the same standard and regain control of your coins.
As for Ledger, I don't know of any app that uses a 24 word list like the Ledger in its native mode, but the Ledger can also be used to bring "bank level security" to other apps like Electrum 2. You can't just switch back and forth, though. You need to wipe out the Ledger and reconfigure it to work in that mode, AFAIK.
So in the end, good question about the Ledger. Surely the Chrome Extension interacts with Ledger servers. What happens if they go down temporarily?

If you're from the US, check out Puerto Rico's Act 22. Move there and any taxable events from trading or liquidating holdings you brought with you will be priced at a ratio of how long you held it while living stateside vs how long you held it as a (new) PR resident before triggering the taxable event. So if you hold for 2 years, move there, and hold for 2 more years before selling, spending, or trading some or all of your holdings for a gain, your taxable events will be priced at a 50% discount (2 years held at full tax, 2 years held at no tax). That's one time you'll want to sell on the dip instead of buy.
Perhaps more importantly, selling, spending, or trading any property (which is how the IRS treats crypto) you acquired after moving there (and qualifying for the program) will not trigger any short or long term capital gains while you continue to live there. Sounds like a crypto daytrading dream.
So go buy a condo by the beach, go nuts on poloniex for a year (using fresh BTC if you can!), chase some ICOs, buy a nice house with your tax-free gains and rent out your original condo on airbnb. Wash, rinse, repeat. Set for life^TM.

@_date: 2017-05-13 19:14:52
Puerto Rico's Acts 20 and 22. Act 20 was designed to attract businesses to move to the island. If the business hires at least 5 locals (and you can become one of the 5 if you move there), then the business taxes are capped at 4%. ~~You can start a real estate business, hiring yourself, your spouse and 3 other permanent employees who work on your properties.~~ (I believe an Act 20 business must be based in PR but offer services off-island.)
Act 22 is designed to attract "high net worth individuals" to move to the island. Once you move there, spend more than 6 months in a tax year there and have your application accepted, you will no longer pay income tax on income sourced from there. Perhaps more importantly, you will also no longer pay capital gains tax (on assets you've acquired after moving there), which is exactly how the IRS treats gains from crypto due to selling, spending, or trading.
So you can spend your winters there (Oct-Mar), shapeshift your way back and forth among cryptos tax-free, and keep buying homes and rental properties with the profits. Totally legit and tax-free.
I'm constantly looking at properties on Zillow trying to find a good place to land first that I could hopefully turn into a rental property after a year.
EDIT: And don't forget actually _spending_ your hard earned crypto. While it would be great to convince your favorite watering hole to accept crypto, you can always bridge the gap with Gyft and shop to your heart's content. You don't have the spectre of overly complicated accounting when trying to convince small businesses to accept it. It can actually work like a low friction currency there.

It would reduce the supply, sure, but you know it would be more "like millions of voices cried out in fear and suddenly were silenced". In the end, I don't think 144,000 BTC would move the market while we're still making, what, 3,600 a day [Edit: Hmm.. that *is* 100 mining days -- nothing to sneeze at]. Ten years from now when the supply has slowed greatly, it would make a bigger impact. Regardless of the potential short or long term impact on the community and the price, I'm just glad we don't have to find out.

I like the idea of addresses that get slowly depleted over time. SiriusXM could easily move to a model that activates or deactivates a radio based on a balance in a given address. I pay about $7/mo for all access. I'd pay $1/wk for a lesser tier used much less frequently. Or 25c/day. I go for weeks without turning it on sometimes. I'd love to activate for a weeklong Florida vacation and just have it deactivate itself after a week.

Read up on HD wallets. They use 12 or 24 word seed word lists. The exact list of words, listed in that exact order, generates a list of thousands of addresses associated with your wallet. 
To increase your privacy, you should use a new address after each time you send BTC and the better HD wallets do that automatically for you. 
The specification is an open standard, so if the infrastructure supporting a specific app goes away, you can just enter your word list into another app that conforms to the same standard and pick up right where you left off. 
This is why it is critical to write down your word list when using one of these wallets. You don't need anything but a compliant wallet and your word list to regain access to your funds.

I feel like we're lagging the predictions in terms of transaction fees replacing the block reward. Unless the price or adoption goes way up, I can see a lot of commercial mining companies disbanding and flooding the market with used miners. I expect this to lead to a big shift back into decentralized mining. The ROI on used gear will be a much more reasonable 12-18 months due to the lower cost to purchase, but the innovation pushing the development of new gear will slow. There are airplane hangars full of mining equipment that I see getting liquidated when the business model truly becomes unsustainable for the large miners.
The next generation of miners will have a much more reasonable expectation for potential earnings and will hopefully stop thinking that they, too, can achieve 2009 level mining rewards with a graphics card. $100 for an ASIC and power supply and $45/mo in electricity bills will likely net about $20/mo in BTC and that should keep the hobby level miner happy.

My then 62 year old mother-in-law read about it in the New Yorker in November of '13. She has a coffee table with money from around the world under the glass top and asked me for a paper wallet to add to the display. I started learning about it right before Gox happened, so I took a year to truly learn everything I could about it. 
What kills me the most is that I used to hang out in the Usenet news group where it was born, but was last there in the 90s, long before it happened. I was also a very early reader of Slashdot, but stopped reading that, too, because I left my basement for a data center.

Please Google AML/KYC (Know Your Customer and Anti Money Laundering)  laws. People who engage in exchanging property for "more than a negligible amount of currency" are considered a Money Transmitter and are required to register as a Money Services Business. There are regulations that such businesses must follow in order to aid in identifying and researching possible cases of money laundering. As you know, it is VERY easy to convert cash (no matter how it was obtained) into Bitcoin and back into virtually any country's currency. Federal governments want to be able to follow the money trail, so they make it illegal for people to "clean" large amounts of money for anonymous people.
Some people regard the behavior you're questioning as a sign of legitimacy and being indicative of a serious business person who does not want to violate federal laws by providing this service to the Bitcoin community. Can it be abused? Sure I guess, especially when combined with other data. Is it a required practice for someone who takes this seriously? Absolutely. At least in the US and EU.

The gorilla in the room that is just now starting​ to get real attention is capital gains. Don't beat yourself up on not having the "free money" to spend on stuff because -- depending on how long you held it -- every dollar of "free money" you could have spent would have triggered a tax bill for 23 to 42 cents the following April.
You're kicking yourself for not being able to pay up to 125% of the price of a car. Or college. That's not much to be upset about.
If you move to Puerto Rico and apply for Act 22, you can buy new crypto and sell or trade it all day tax-free. Residents don't pay capital gains tax. Then that "free money" is actually free money. 
@_date: 2015-10-20 09:17:04
I also spend from multiple HD wallets in parallel, but not for privacy reasons. In the US, we are required to track the exchange rate when we acquire BTC and the exchange rate when we sell or spend. If the delta in the exchange rate multiplied by the amount transacted results in a gain of more than 50c, we are required to report those as capital gains.  
I establish a new HD wallet each time I buy BTC and name the wallet with the exchange rate. Then, whenever I need to spend, I pick a wallet that was bought at or just above the current exchange rate. I never have any reportable events. 
It can be a nightmare trying to figure out the cost basis on a "sale" if you are spending BTC that was acquired at a variety of different exchange rates. It doesn't work like paper dollars in your wallet. If I ever need to spend a lot more than any one wallet holds, I'll just hit a LibertyX and load up a new wallet at the current price.

Most everyone agrees not to spend more than once from a single address (not saying you're suggesting that). A subset of that group also believes it is harmful to send BTC to the same address more than once, as it ties together multiple, otherwise unrelated entities. Electrum 2 will change your receiving address only after sending a payment, but Mycelium will change your receiving address even after just receiving a payment. The more you reuse a single address for either activity, the more some people will freak out.
One idea that I can't get out of my head is to use a cheap digital picture frame. I'm sure there's a script out there that will spit out 'x' number of deposit addresses from a given seed word list. Capture those addresses and convert them into QR codes. Place 10,000 of those QR codes on an SD card inserted into a picture frame and then configure the picture frame to cycle through all of the pictures in random order. Then, whenever you go to make a deposit, chances are slim that you'll ever hit the same QR code twice, but you'll know that you'll pick up all the BTC if you enter the word list in a compatible app like Mycelium or Electrum. I'm sure Breadwallet also follows the standard.
You'll still need to securely store your seed word list elsewhere, but at least you won't have multiple deposits to the same deposit address. It helps maintain your privacy.
This "solution" grew out of a hypothetical situation whereby I wanted to replace a donation can in a convenience store with a Bitcoin address. In the example, say a dog rescue, I would intermingle pictures designed to evoke a reaction with "Donate now using Bitcoin" pictures, so they had to be in a specific order. In your case, you just want to turn on the frame and deposit some BTC across multiple addresses as they cycle through. Nothing to hack. No security measures required.

No way. Not with that published research history. Nothing about the history of economics, law, determining the value of commodities, property, smart contracts, programmable money (ANYTHING about money, really) or trusted 3rd parties (a KEY concept in Bitcoin). This guy just has math and key concepts central to cryptography. Bitcoin is so much more than just crypto. WAY more.
I'm sure you already have, but I suggest you go back and look through Nick Szabo's (library)[szabo.best.vwh.net]. All of the key concepts touched upon by Bitcoin are covered there. Nick even once wrote about how he managed to maintain a false identity on the Internet that no one had figured out by then. The hours that Satoshi worked on the project aligned with the free time that Nick would have had as a law student in Washington, DC, and Satoshi once (accidentally) logged onto the forums from a computer in California where Nick was known to have access to some systems.

I think the real benefit comes from their confirming the legitimacy of it. The more they treat it like a commodity with real value as opposed to throwing it away like a broken kid's toy, the better off it is for everyone. The fact that they treat the BTC the same exact way that they treat all property seized as part of criminal prosecution again increases its legitimacy. If they just destroyed the disks with the keys or even worse sent them to the Bitoin eater address, I think that would be far worse for everyone. They are separating the BTC from the crime, which is a great thing, IMHO.

My pleasure as always, thanks for the tip. I still love your app!
I'll love it even more if you add CSV exports of transaction data ;)
wallet name, transaction tag, tx date, tx time (HH:MM:SS), , tx id on the blockchain, my public address, amount sent in BTC, amount sent in USD
I'll enter a start and end date, click Generate CSV, and then the Share context menu should pop up asking me what app I want to use to send the resulting file. I always create a new wallet for each BTC purchase and put the exchange rate in the wallet name - makes it easy to calculate the cost basis of the purchase as well as the sale.

Spending, selling, or swapping BTC at a higher value than when you acquired it is a taxable event. Yes they will report it. Yes it will count because you converted it back into fiat. You locked in the gains by selling. I keep all of my purchases separate and I keep track of exactly how much each bundle cost when I bought it. That way I can look at the current price and see if I have any that is safe to spend. Oh, and I don't use Coinbase. I buy through exchanges that don't offer web wallets. Finally, by buying in all price ranges, I can (typically) sell, spend, or trade at any price range. Just not the current one!
So many people focus on the "free money" aspect of it and go out and buy expensive stuff with the windfall without realizing that they are paying up to 143% of the cost by selling the most expensive BTC they own to buy whatever it is they bought.
I've been buying for 2.5 years. The most I've ever spent was $20 on a stone at a county fair. I forgot to show up with BTC, so I bought some BTC with cash off the vendor first and turned around and gave right back to him to buy the stone! The cost basis was a wash since I bought it and sold it immediately.

You're right. I was over simplifying. Chat Secure supports many different types of logins, but I always used it with Google.

Even that small step is a big step forward in privacy. OTR done right really is nice.

Perfect! The math almost immediately goes over my head, though. Can you tell if any of the implementations offer a command line switch to invoke this unsafe server option? I'd want to know that the code safely drops the seed words if they match the seed words used on a Ledger or Trezor.

So the secure element is paired to the custom decoder card that was included in the box. Every card has a different map. The Nano doesn't transmit any data over the Internet, the open source application Chrome app does that. With the new firmware coming out of Beta soon, you can replace the decoder card with your phone for 2FA, but you must use the card that shipped with the device to pair the phone. 
Just like with the Trezor, the private keys never leave the device. If malware tries to secretly change the destination address during transaction construction, the Nano won't sign it because the addressees and checksums won't match up.
Maybe you didn't know that they have opened all code that they could? Or that each decoder card is customized for and paired directly with each Nano, one to one?
It could also be that I bought mine from Eric himself from a pile that the team carried themselves to Miami.

I wouldn't necessarily hold a law student to very high standards of quality for programming. Remember, too, that he asked if anyone would help him code up a proof of concept. If no one did, that would certainly explain the low quality code. His forte was clearly in theory and real life application over programming. I honestly think it still fits.

For non technical people, I describe it as a new global currency not issued or controlled by any government or bank. It was designed to enable direct transactions between any set of parties on Earth who wish to exchange money -- be they people, businesses, organizations, whatever. It does not need any banks to support the transfers and it cannot have its value tweaked by governments who may want to prop up their own domestic currency. It puts everyone on the same playing field from an economic perspective. 
Some people mistakenly believe that it provides anonymous money transfers, which therefore attracts drug dealers and criminals. Well, the most prolific criminal users found out the hard way that, in its purest form, Bitcoin is easier to trace through the system than cash.
There are plenty of legitimate users (and uses!) of the currency, and as it gains popularity it will become much easier to spend this global currency just about anywhere your travels may take you. The world's leading tax authorities have issued guidance instructing their taxpayers how to deal with reporting any gains made by acquiring and spending or selling Bitcoin, bringing even more legitimacy to the product. 
We are still relatively early in the life of Bitcoin, so the value tends to fluctuate quite a bit, although 2014 showed a bit of maturity settling into the price. As more people and businesses recognize the value and flexibility of Bitcoin, the more people will start using it, driving up global demand, and thus its value, over time. 
"I'll be happy to show you how it works if you'd like to see it in action. Just keep in mind that what I'm about to show you works exactly the same way between any two cellphones or PCs on the planet, at exactly the same speed. There are no performance benefits to be had just because we're sitting here together."

My wife and I chatted up her uncle over the dinner table a couple nights ago. He still plays live music gigs for tips in Second Life, so he's all over digital currencies. I thought he would be excited about Bitcoin, but no, he was really nervous about it. 
He said he won't touch it until there's more regulation around it. I explained the FinCEN and IRS guidance that has already been published, and he immediately recognized that the government has given it full legitimacy. I also explained how the SR auctions further solidified that position. 
He asked, "What about all those times it was hacked?" Bitcoin the protocol and the pure base functionality was never hacked. What was hacked were the equivalent of banks and financial institutions that people trusted to hold their Bitcoin. You're not required to trust anyone to manage your Bitcoins for you, and you're seeing what happens sometimes when you do. Then my wife whipped out a paper wallet from her purse and I handed him my keychain with my Ledger Nano on it. He was intrigued by the fact that the secure element that is just now making its way into American bank cards was already being used to secure Bitcoin. The "be your own bank" moniker can be taken a little more seriously when you can demonstrate the same exact technology protecting cash and BTC. 
What about the criminal element? To criminals, cash is and will always be king. It is untraceable, but can be a little bulky to carry around, depending on the quantity and denomination. Bitcoin was designed from the beginning to make every slice of every penny traceable back in time through every wallet that ever held it, all the way back to the moment it was created. The biggest arrests made to date involving criminals using Bitcoin were enabled because it is so easily traced. "Wow!"
He talked about how one of the items in his bucket list is to sell just one song. I asked about his YouTube channel, but he hasn't done much with it. I explained ChangeTip and it's integration with YouTube.
All in all, it's like he waited the perfect amount of time before becoming willing to check it out. So many things have changed just in the last year, that I wouldn't have been able to answer his questions and offer real functionality that pertains directly to what he does in SL and wants to do on YouTube. 
I think he genuinely felt that I answered all of his concerns and he summed it up with, "Cool! I will definitely check it out!" I could have had him load up an app so I could send (or sell) him $5 right on the spot, but I didn't want to take it from a Q&amp;A session to radical preaching. We'll see if he reaches out to me with more questions.

I totally support and encourage entering your word list on a different app and recovering your funds.. Mycelium to Electrum or Airbitz or whatever. I think it's a mistake to try to generate raw keys from the word list on your own, unless that app or command line parameter already exists on a client. I'm afraid you're getting stuck on actually seeing the private keys with your own two eyes in order to trust the process. Hopefully you're coming around and will start by just entering your word list on a different app. Maybe after that you'll still feel the need to develop an app to generate the actual private keys, but hopefully you won't. That will be a ton of wasted effort and reduce the security of that particular word list by exposing thousands or hundreds of thousands of keys in raw text.
If you do eventually get to the point that you're concerned about your app sending thousands of your keys to a server for processing, Electrum has you covered in that you may also choose to run your own server. There are people out there running open servers who donate their processing power to Electrum clients, but you may also choose to run your own server and either keep it private for your own use or open it up and make it public for other end users to use. Running your own server enables you to keep all of your keys contained within systems that you own and manage. Hopefully you have the sysadmin skills to keep it protected if you decide to go that route.

Just a quick point. Divisibility doesn't affect the total amount in circulation. If slicing a single gold bar into 100,000,000 slices (the same - but changeable - limit for BTC) somehow created 100,000,000 gold bars, people would be slicing them up all day. A lot of people think it does, though; we see that a lot around here.
Divisibility only increases the usability of each BTC, not the total number of BTCs that have been mined. That limit doesn't need to change unless each BTC reaches $1 million. 
@_date: 2015-11-30 23:31:05
As has been mentioned, it is very easy for you to take your money back after the sale, ripping off the seller. Expect to pay way more than the going rate in order to make the seller feel safe. Also, the "ID crap" is federal law, so you can expect to pay even more (again) if and when when you find someone who is willing to ignore that requirement. You are basically asking for the most expensive way to buy by a long shot, with your only two requirements being two big reasons to charge way more than the going rate.
Preev is showing $377 ATM. A seller should charge you $500 per 1 BTC. If you pay their price, they will either make $123 in profit or lose $377 if you choose to rip them off by taking your money back. If you do try to rip them off, I believe PayPal is getting better about understanding how to prove that you actually did receive the BTC, though, so who knows how much longer that scam will actually be successful. It's just a hassle for the seller if you try to rip them off and the $123 in profit goes to the effort they would need to put in to prove that you lied if you try to get your money back.
This is true for all forms of reversible payments for Bitcoin. That's why I pay cash at LibertyX locations. Its the fastest way to buy BTC and at the cheapest rates around. But I did give them my ID.

This really belongs in r/bitcoinbeginners.
That being said, hardware wallets are different from plain old USB keys because they contain an isolated CPU and associated secure RAM that cannot be reached from the computer or phone you are using.
Software on the device you use sends a request over a one-way channel containing the destination address to pay and the amount to send. The isolated processor running its own internal software picks up the request on the other end of the one-way channel and asks you to confirm via another device that you did indeed request the transaction. Once you verify your intent, the hardware wallet software selects the keys and inputs to use to honor the request. The processor then accesses the private keys that are stored in the secure area that your PC or phone cannot reach, constructs the transaction that will fulfill your request, signs it, and returns the signed transaction over a different one-way channel back to the PC or phone you are using. In case you are not aware, it is perfectly safe to expose Bitcoin addresses and signed transactions. Those are what all participants throughout the network see. 
You should be able to see why hardware wallets are resistant to malware. No software on your PC or phone can reach the processor, RAM or secure storage area on your hardware wallet where the private keys are stored and transactions are constructed and signed. If you store raw private keys on a USB key, you have to go to great lengths to protect that information. With a hardware wallet (just like any modern HD wallet), you only need to protect your 12 or 24 words. You can buy a metal plate from Cryptosteel with the first four letters of your 12 or 24 words etched into it.
Bread wallet on iOS uses the iOS device's secure storage area to safely store the private keys used by the software to sign transactions, but there is no secure, isolated processor or execution environment that is protected from malware. Only the private keys are protected.
Samsung takes it a step further on the Note 5 or S6 or higher by presenting an actual isolated processor and RAM to accompany that secure storage. In fact, Ledger ported the software they run on their older generation hardware wallets to run in that secure area called the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). Mycelium and Green Address on Android are able to interact with the TEE in exactly the same way those apps support a Ledger HW.1 or Nano Classic.
The Nano S and Trezor are hardware wallets that support different types of coins. I believe only the Nano S supports ERC20 tokens, so it supports a broader range of coins and can easily be configured to support new ones that it might not support out of the box.
As far as losing the devices go, the protection mechanism is the same as any modern HD wallet. When you setup the device, you will be asked to write down 12 or 24 words. Those words are all you need should you lose or destroy your device -- same as if you lost or destroyed a phone with an HD wallet installed. Just get a new device (or a different device or app that uses a compatible word list) and restore your setup using the word list you were given when you setup the device you are looking to replace. Software and hardware HD wallets all work the same way in that regard.
Finally, in terms of monitoring your balances. In case you are not aware,  you can actually create multiple HD wallets off a single word list. Many HD wallets (software or hardware) offer an xPubKey for each HD wallet you've created. You can then import that xPubKey on a phone-based wallet app as a watch-only wallet. You will then either be able to monitor the balance of that imported wallet or transfer funds into it. You cannot spend from a watch-only address or wallet, so it offers perfect safety for monitoring the balances on your hardware wallet without risking accidental spends from those watched wallets.
I start a new HD wallet every time I buy BTC since we are required to document the purchase date, amount, and price paid for each purchase. So I have several HD wallets on my Nano Classic. I have exported the xPubKeys of each of those wallets into watch-only wallets on Mycelium on my phone. I also have a handful of HD wallets where the primary balance is on my phone, but I have created their equivalents on my Nano Classic and exported their xPubKeys to my phone as well.
What this means is that I can go into Mycelium on my phone and on the Accounts tab, I can see a few HD wallets with balances in them on my phone as well as a list of watch-only wallets that I can only spend from when I plug my Nano Classic into my laptop. When I become uncomfortable with the amount of BTC that I am keeping on a specific HD wallet on my phone, I transfer some or all of it to the watch-only HD wallet with the same name. That moves the balance over to the safety of my Nano Classic but doesn't change my total balance at the bottom of the Accounts list.
There's a lot to read in here. If you don't get it on the first try, read it again. Also head over to r/bitcoinbeginners for more help if you still need it at this level.

Ledger is the company. They built a couple of products around the same security chips that have been protecting bank card transactions for nearly two decades. I bought the high end model for $30. There is a no frills version that costs half as much. So there's really no "investment" to speak of.
I love the premise of it. They are updating a LOT, though, and I often find myself 1,000 miles away from my decoder card that is used to reinitialize it after a major update.
The product is great, very strong. The functional model is identical to Trezor - you have a device that generates and never exports the private keys. You connect it to your USB port and a web based app requests that the device construct and sign transactions. The device delivers the signed transaction to your PC which broadcasts it via the website. You may also use it with other services, such as multi sig and hardware authentication to websites. 
For a very short time, it was possible to steal private keys from a Trezor courtesy of a leaky USB cable. The chip based Ledger devices plug directly into your USB port. There is no cable. When the Chinese released a crappy version of the Trezor, the company decided to give up on their principles and change the software license of the released code to prevent anyone else from using the code to release a competing product. The user community freaked out on them and they relented. 
The Ledger devices are too small to include displays for secure transaction verification. They included decoder cards customized for each device, but were roundly mocked for doing that. Given enough transactions, a snoop could eventually map the customized decoder card. It took them several months but they eventually added the ability to securely verify transactions using your cellphone. That keeps the devices smaller than a house key, a feature that I absolutely love. 
The Ledger team just seems so much more professional in every way. I've had the opportunity to interact with Eric on a few occasions. He's pretty cool and seems to know exactly what he's doing. I'm a 20+ year Linux guy, so believe me when I say I appreciate the purpose of Open Source. The Trezor team already showed their true colors the first time they saw any direct competition based directly on their product.
Ledger has taken a more pragmatic approach, releasing all the code they can as Open Source, but keeping the secret parts hidden as specified by the licensing agreement for the chip hardware. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the innovation and forward thinking that Trezor brought to the hobby and industry, but I can't carry it on my keychain, I can't trust their security practices and I definitely can't trust their principles.
Besides, when you go to securely log into a website, would you rather reach for something about the size of an Apple TV remote with a USB cable or something about the half the size of and blended in with your house and car keys?
@_date: 2015-03-17 11:12:41
I think you're trying too hard to get back to a raw list of private keys. The market is moving in the direction of keeping them away from the user as much as possible to increase safety. If you can't get to them, they can't be stolen from you. Focus on letting the app generate the keys based on your word list.
Don't worry, the apps do not rely upon the server in order to access the keys, but you should be aware of the security implications of those clients copying some or all of your keys to the servers for processing of transactions. 
You can always take your word list somewhere else and have another wallet app regenerate your list of keys based on your word list without needing to "export" them first. This isn't like Coinbase where they have your private keys. You still own all your keys. They are just safely hidden away from you to make it more difficult to get fooled into giving them away.

I'm right there with you and it even pained me to type it. If we see a huge drop in centralized mining, then the difficulty should drop. The market may get flooded with cheap used ASICs, causing hobbyists to strike a new balance between cost, expenses, ROI and a new metric of satisfaction with the hobby. Again, I hope the next generation of miners will be willing to replace a desire to get rich quick with a desire to help the network, even if their own ROI is over the horizon.

I read this sub from Nov/13 to Jan/15 before making my first purchase. I was really weird about buying in person via LocalBitcoins. The markup was too high and too many people were reporting getting robbed.
I managed to build up some tips by posting helpful answers around here, installed Mycelium on my phone and transferred some BTC to my phone and back to ChangeTip -- just to learn the mechanics.
When LibertyX announced, I went to a location nearby just to ask if they were still on the network LibertyX uses; they were not. A couple months later I tried again at a different location and the buy went perfectly. 
I just installed Electrum for the first time tonight. After buying and spending through my phone for several months, using a wallet on a PC still seems weird to me, having "grown up" using it on a mobile device. It just feels like it was born to be mobile.

So if an employee is being sneaky, then there's a risk that any donations sent to that address won't actually make it to the foundation. If the foundation was behind it, one would think they would have a far more robust page. 
Someone should send a donation there and then email the foundation to thank them for accepting Bitcoin. That it's great to see yet another high profile organization realize that they were missing out on a potential revenue stream by ignoring Bitcoin until now. That will get their attention.

I don't know if they sell things that were initially stolen but whose rightful owner can easily be identified. So yes, they sell cars that were seized from criminals who used them during the commission of a crime, but I don't know if they make an effort to return stolen vehicles used in crimes to their rightful owners first. 
That being said, when my father in law's car was stolen and recovered a few weeks later, the insurance company wouldn't let him take it back and return the insurance money. They said they already sold the title (?!) and now it belonged to someone else. 
Some people insist that the SR BTC was stolen from MTGOX and it should be returned to the account holders who got shafted. Perhaps there was no easy way to truly identify how much BTC belonged to each account holder or they just didn't want to go down that rat hole.

Imagine if a contingent of Bank of America employees decided to mutiny and duplicated the entire structure of the bank, calling the duplicate Bank of Shamerica. They recreated every single bank account with the same exact account numbers and retained the passwords. They couldn't fund the new accounts with USD, so they funded them with an equal quantity of something called Sham Dollars. All of the original BofA customers can log into the new Bank of Shamerica website and see their existing balances, but the balances are now designated in Sham Dollars. This whole endeavor has no impact on their accounts and balances that still exist at BofA. 
Customers still have their USD at BofA. They just also have Sham Dollars at BofShamA. If you keep your BTC on an exchange like Coinbase, you don't hold your keys and Coinbase can go and claim the Sham Dollars that you would otherwise be able to claim. It may not be worth much in the end, but it is basically free money.

You've got a lot of reading to do.
1) You don't hold Bitcoins in a wallet. You hold pieces of data that authorize you to spend BTC sitting in one or more addresses.
2) This is the exact problem that was solved with the release of Bitcoin. Everyone agrees on how much BTC is stored in each address with the assumption that everyone would love to fake out the system and artificially increase their balances. Nodes verify how much BTC sits in each address and miners make transactions part of the permanent record.
3) The number of Bitcoins created each day drops by half every four years. At first, 50 were created every 10 minutes (on average), and it has already slowed to 12.5 (again, on average). Starting in the year 2085, that will mark the beginning of the final 10 BTC being created, and it will take 55 years to create the final 10. The creation of new coins has already started to slow dramatically and the ecosystem will really start to feel the pinch 3ish years from now. It is volatile because the rest of the world is starting to learn about its features and capabilities. The price is rising at a meteoric rate, and traditional investors are taking profits at regular intervals.
4) Hardware wallets provide the highest levels of security and you'll get your $100 worth out of one very quickly. It's (almost) always a good time to buy because a lot of us believe it is going to rise dramatically even from here. But it is not a get rich quick scheme. You could easily buy at $1,800 and see it drop to $1,500 in a couple weeks and stay down there for months. If you can't handle that, then don't buy. I personally don't feel the price should have risen this high this quickly, but I've been holding for a couple years and have seen the prices go way up and down during that time.

That's an interesting update. I made two purchases back in January, before they introduced fees. I saw the email and knew that the fee structure was being implemented. When I logged in after the announcement, I started seeing indications of being able to store USD at the web site. What happens if you don't redeem the PIN code within 24 hours? Do they just bank the USD for you? There has to be more to the story since they already have your cash. 
I'm definitely a happy customer -- I just want to know more about this 24 hour time limit and what happens when you miss it.
@_date: 2017-05-29 16:48:54
If the BTC you used to spend on your purchase increased in value while you held it, yes, you are responsible for reporting that increase in value and paying the appropriate extra tax on it. The length of time you held it determines the tax rate. The rate is high if you held it less than a year and drops if you hold it longer than a year. 
Say someone started mining at the beginning of high school 8 years ago. They held the BTC all the way through college and are now sitting on a ton of money with that BTC. They celebrate graduating college buy buying a nice new car with by selling that mined BTC. Well, that was not free money. They will now owe Uncle Sam an extra 23% of the cost of the car next April.
It also gets more complicated than that because if you bought small amounts at wildly varying prices over time, you will need to keep track of all of your purchases. How much did you buy, on what date, and what was the exchange rate at the time? Then when you go to sell or spend it, you need to document all those statistics again and figure out much you made or lost on each chunk of BTC you used in your purchase.
Spending BTC that has significantly increased in value is simply not attractive in the US.

While ChatSecure and other high quality implementations of OTR Messaging are really the best approach you can find for the use case, the whole use case breaks down, I think, because the first thing you do is establish a link between your ID and IP address and your chat partner's ID and IP. You will never be able to decrypt messages sent via the system (not even under gunpoint -- which I love) but it doesn't mean you won't do jail time until you reveal the contents. I don't think a judge wants to hear that entire purpose of OTR is to make sure that no one can EVER decrypt a message after a few seconds -- not even the sender or recipient. All Google can do is prove that you two exchanged messages. They don't even know which messages had content since it sends junk to fill the gaps.
If you've been around these parts long enough, BitMessage is like the old Quicksilver and anonymous remailers and newsgroup posters. With BitMessage you broadcast your messages with a pseudonymous recipient listed and hope that the intended recipient scans the message pool looking for messages addressed to them. Now no one can read the messages you send, nor can they identify the intended recipient based solely on the destination of the original message. It's going to a pool, not a specific Gmail id. I'd like to see BitMessage get a solid foundation like OTR so it can become the basis of many private messengers. When you can't ever decrypt a message you sent and no one can detect even the eventual intended recipient, now you're getting somewhere. I love OTR, but it starts by handing over the solution to a big hurdle that needs to be crossed -- identifying point to point connections.

So I did some more checking this morning to get the straight scoop. Turns out I work with two people who were in the group that became the IBM PC Company. One was employee  and the other was employee  maybe 36. They both worked directly for Don Estridge, the name on the Middle School.
While the building I pointed to yesterday on Clint Moore was the location of the first manufacturing line (probably the huge FedEx building), they both say the prototype was developed in a skunkworks-like building called "Bldg 203" located two streets down from the Middle School on Banyan. Very close to what you were originally told.
I've been working for IBM for 15 years and I had no idea this area was steeped in so much history for the company. I always thought NY's Hudson Valley was the home of every major development. 
Thanks for bringing this up. It was fun doing a little research about it.

Interesting. A friend of mine who worked on the team in this building
4650 Broken Sound Blvd
said the PC was invented in one of these buildings

Maybe a little work was done throughout the area. I was surprised when you said it was shuttered since the building on Clint Moore isn't. I was expecting you to say someplace up in Poughkeepsie thinking that's where IBM did most of its hardware development.  I would have expected that long before Boca.

The answer is always, "it depends". It depends on how long you expect to live in retirement and _how_ you expect to live in retirement. I probably have 12 more years to go and should live about 15-20 years beyond that. 2020 is _way_ too early for this kind of talk.
My wife grew up in the house where we will spend our summers, and I'm looking at buying a condo in Puerto Rico for the winters since we're about to complete our first mortgage. We'll put in our 183 days a year in Puerto Rico enabling us to spend our crypto without capital gains taxes. We'll visit my family in California, maybe do some Viking river tours in Europe, tour A/NZ and see Southeast Asia along the way.
At the opposite end of the spectrum, check out Those people are semi-retired, but not always by choice. They literally have nothing going on and have no money to do anything if they wanted to. You can retire right now if you want to live the NEET life. Doesn't sound like it's for me, though.

There's always going to be a vocal group. People rarely go through the trouble to say everything went and continues to go perfectly. They have so many customers that you could fill a sub with "non complaints". For every complaint you could probably find 100 or 1,000 happy customers. 
That being said, I don't use them (or any web wallets). I buy BTC with cash at LibertyX locations. BTC transfers start immediately. No cancelation notices five days after you initiated your purchase. No sending in a picture of you holding your driver's license. No needing to describe to them why you want to transfer BTC out of your web wallet (because there is none -- all BTC deposits go into real addresses you control).
Those are all real complaints that we hear about in here multiple times a week attributable to well known web wallets. I just use Mycelium on Android and instruct LibertyX to deposit my BTC straight into my Mycelium wallet.

I studied this stuff for six months before I ever asked my first question (last May). I studied it for over a year before I bought my first BTC. I long believed the feds were behind it before I learned about Nick Szabo. It's a perfect replacement for cash in terms of law enforcement. It is so attractive to criminals, yet was perfectly traceable (until tumblers came along). Pair that up with the NSA ECDSA elliptic curve conspiracy theory, and it seemed like the perfect honeypot. Move millions of dollars in seconds for almost no fee right from your phone! No one* can figure out the identity of people moving coins!
Part of the reason you see the left hand/right hand problem within the US Federal Gov't with respect to "What is Bitcoin?" is that the law enforcement arm wants to see greater adoption while the revenue side wants to kill it. I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop during the second half of this year when the audits start coming in for people who didn't report properly. I know it was generally a down year overall, but there opportunities almost every single day for someone to spend at a gain yet not report it. The feds want to see every gain over 50c earned during the year. Sure you can wash it against losses, but they still want to see those gains shown. How many people are going to get charged with tax fraud for willfully not reporting gains? The year started out at a pretty low price, so I think we're going to see a lot more people have an "up" year this year.

Thank you for the quick reply. The only merchants whose ear I have would need to replace an older (but still digital) cash register and still need to process cash and credit/debit alongside BTC with full (certified?) accountability built in. Preferably at around $200, including two screens, one facing the cashier the other facing the customer. The unit must be able to integrate with traditional back end processors as well as either take straight BTC or, as yours, integrate with BitPay or Coinbase for BTC payment processing. Counter space in the really small shops tends to be at a premium, so anything larger than an external credit card processing terminal would be too big for the shops I interact with.
Thanks again for the quick reply. Hopefully this will help shape your product a bit.

LibertyX has locations throughout the Miami area. Sign up takes under 10 minutes and allows you to buy $1,000 a day or $2,500 per week. So it'll take you two buys separated by a week to complete your purchase. Plus they only charge 1% over Bitstamp after the first $1,000. So $36 fee on $4,600 if you've never used them before. 
Very reasonably priced and I've had good experience with support.

Are you sure it wasn't posted before?
As for Satoshi, no. I'm in the Nick Szabo camp. His library ( is full of essays on an incredibly wide variety of topics, nearly all of which are touched upon by Bitcoin. He writes about the history of economics, the history of money, valuations, smart contracts, how to codify smart contracts as computer software, the concept of property and ownership, the risks of trusted third parties and many, many more concerns and issues that Bitcoin resolves or attempts to resolve. He also asked if anyone wanted to help him develop his second attempt at digital cash before disappearing for a few months only to return shortly before Bitcoin was announced. He also made minor grammatical changes to a three year old important white paper of his a day or two before Bitcoin was announced. Finally, with everything that Nick wrote about for years before Bitcoin's introduction (including his first attempt at digital cash, Bit Gold), Satoshi "magically" never heard of Nick's work but credited a few other guys who already tried digital cash but didn't contribute knowledge to the supporting topics.
If that wasn't enough, he described perfecting the ability to maintain a secret online identity that no one had figured out as of yet.
Nick was already a renowned expert in numerous specialty areas of finance, law, economics and technology before Satoshi appeared but Satoshi was not familiar with this work -- only the work of guys that Nick interacted with about these topics quite frequently. Riiiiiiiight.

Sure you can. That's the point I'm pushing here. As soon as you create an HD wallet, you should write down the seed word list. You can then take that word list to any other app that applies the same open standard and "restore" your list of keys by entering the same word list in the same exact order on any other app on any other device. Every compliant app will generate the same exact sequence of private keys and Bitcoin addresses when the same exact word list is entered in the same exact order. The keys are protected from direct access by you to prevent malware from accessing those keys using your access privileges. And if the keys are encrypted in such a way that only the app can decrypt them, then even a privilege escalation attack won't reveal the keys. At best, the malware will be able to copy the encrypted file.
It's like a one way diode. You can take your word list anywhere and generate the same exact set of keys on any device running any compliant app and you don't need to take steps to export your keys before restoring them elsewhere. If you drop your phone off a boat, you can go home, pull up your word list and enter them on another device running a compliant app and immediately regain access to all your funds. So long as the app you're using now is compliant with the standard, then they could shut down all of the servers and you would have immediate access to all your funds on any other app or service that is compliant with the same standards. The word list unlocks your funds anywhere that uses the standard approach.

@_date: 2015-10-22 17:21:55


True. I left it up to the reader to surmise that the restaurants would distribute tips to the servers at the end of the day. If guests paying by BTC deposit to the same address and it never moves then it is certainly not full blown reuse.
If you assume that the restaurant could untangle the payments from the tips and pay out tips to the serving staff all from the same address all the time then, yes, that would be full-blown reuse. Repeatedly receiving and spending to and from the same address all day, every day is what we're talking about here.
I'm sure there are plenty of people who feel like they don't need to hide their tracks or concern themselves with the implications of doing so. They also inadvertently link themselves to other people and other people to each other. Say someone buys some pot using an HD wallet from a vendor who has been compromised. The feds see every public address that pays this seller. The customer then buys a cup of coffee at a diner that uses a single address. If all that was known about the customer of both places are the BTC address that used to buy pot and the change address used to buy coffee, then the diner with known Bitcoin and street addresses just put the customer with a drug buying past at a given place at a given time.
Finally, those tip jars are typically emptied throughout the day. The money is pooled and people are paid shares. Once it's empty, it's empty. On the BTC side anyone can see every satoshi that has come and gone from that tip jar since inception. It's not analogous in terms of privacy and openness. You'd have to stare at the jar all the time and ask them how much they received each time they emptied it.
I've previously described a simple approach to reduce reuse in situations like that by standing up a small digital picture frame. Make jpegs of about 100 addresses and intermingle them with fun pictures of the staff being friendly with customers. Show three pictures of staff and customers, followed by a QR for tips. Put about 25 pictures in rotation blended in with 100 QRs and you'll likely never see more than one tip in an address. I usually use that solution to describe a donation jar for animal rescues or similar organizations, but it works the same for tip jars.
Not everyone wants or feels the need to provide basic privacy, but there are side effects if they don't even try.

Kinda hard to get registered on an exchange. Can you sell stuff on Craigslist and accept Bitcoin? I will occasionally search CL for "bitcoin" just to see what people who will take BTC are selling.
I would look into registering with BitWage as soon as you turn 18. Then when you get jobs that pay via direct deposit, send it to BitWage and they'll split up each payment into any mix of BTC and cash you specify. It really doesn't get ANY easier in terms of buying, and you're buying the most sensible way -- Dollar Cost Averaging.

Ledger is supplementing the "secret decoder card" for 2FA with this feature and will support using your phone to securely verify the destination when sending BTC. The signing still occurs offline within the secure element, and the Nano will not sign a transaction to an address that does not match the one displayed on your PC and phone. 
If you're thinking "malware", the only way for malware to alter the destination address of a signed transaction is for it to infect the PC, the phone, both communication paths AND the firmware of the secure element on the Nano -- a feat that is said to take weeks with access to million dollar equipment. 
Once it goes GA, this will mark the end of the argument that the Ledger does not have a screen or buttons, and it will certainly bring an end to the argument that the secret decoder card can be mapped after x number of transactions.
Very exciting development. 
@_date: 2015-03-08 15:10:32
I created a different wallet each time I bought BTC, and I labeled the wallet with the purchase price and date. When I needed to spend, I only spent from wallets that were funded with BTC where I was losing money. I also tagged each transaction with the purpose, the value in USD and the exchange rate at the time.
I never commingle BTC purchased at different exchange rates in the same wallet and I never spend BTC that would result in a gain if I spent it.

If someone maliciously steals your balance, you are not likely to get it back. But if someone steals or you destroy a physical device that is managing your balance and no one else can control your balance, then you can regain control of your balance easily on another device or app that uses the same method for generating your private keys.
Hardware wallets are very safe and resistant to malicious theft of your balances. Even HD wallets on your phone are relatively safe so long as you take steps to prevent unauthorized access to your phone and use 2FA to verify your intent on another device prior to executing a spend transaction.
If you have your word list protected somewhere, and you lose or destroy your phone or hardware wallet running an HD wallet app, you are still fine and your balances are still protected. 
@_date: 2015-03-21 09:10:51
This is why the big payment processors advertise that they accept all risk in handled transactions. If you insert BitPay between the customer and the accounting books, the shop is always credited with the payment, even if the customer manages to kill the transaction. And if the shop keeps the payments entirely as BTC, that's a great way to eliminate any risk to the shop owner while still expanding the Bitcoin universe.

Move to Puerto Rico and apply for Act 22 exemption. No capital gains on assets acquired after moving there. Plus you pay a ratio on capital gains made on assets you held prior to moving there. So if you held for 2 years, moved there and held for 2 more years before spending, your tax bill drops by 50%.
You must really live there, though, and spend at least 183 days a year there. Between Gyft and Xapo, you shouldn't have any trouble spending your crypto there once you get approved. Maybe even buy a home with crypto if you can find an interested seller. I saw a house drop $70k in a week recently on Zillow.

a) presents a different payment address for each transaction, and
b) uses a safe HD wallet in that it only generates the Load addresses
That way, you can load up the seed words from a Ledger or Trezor but the cart software and web server will never know anything about the private keys -- it will only generate the Load addresses in the same sequence as your hardware wallet. Your entire system will be protected from hackers, but it would be up to you to manually issue payments, such as refunds and the like. Even if your hardware wallet isn't notified of which address is being used by each transaction, it should still be able to find those transactions because it would eventually use those addresses anyway. Sound about right?
Has anyone published an algorithm that generates only the safe addresses from a seed list? I feel like it can't be that difficult to build. All the payments would go straight into hw cold storage, never even temporarily sitting on your hosts. Your server would never hold anything but safe addresses.
EDIT: I wonder if it could be coded up as a feature in the Ledger or Trezor -- generate a CSV of the next 100,000 Load addresses and transfer them to the host.Now you have keys for 100k transactions which, for a small business, would likely carry you for a lifetime. I could see there's a risk of a hacker changing the CSV. Maybe it sits on an SD card with the write protect switch thrown. Maybe, depending on your website setup, the CSV sits on a CIFS share that is mounted read only on your app tier and the read write option is password protected. Maybe the CSV (and the cart software) runs from a CD or uses other secure methods to prevent changing the executable code.

Trezor and Ledger are the way to go based on your specifications. Trezor is giving back to the community by using Open Source software, but Ledger is bringing ultra secure technology trusted by banks and the financial industry for a decade or more. 
I bought my Ledger Nano from the CTO for $30 at a conference, but it's hard to find that price anywhere. Before anyone says you want a built in screen, they are currently developing 2FA with your cellphone as the screen.

Interesting point. I usually look at the far end and point out that starting 70 years from now, it will take 55 years to mine the last 40 BTC, or what we mine now every 15 minutes (on average). Your view actually talks to me directly about the last five years before retirement. 
That puts a very different spin on it for me.

Don't know. Just heard about it and confirmed seeing it on their website today. I still don't know what happens after 24 hours. They may buy and hold the BTC for you, requiring you to transfer the BTC to a wallet address of your choosing the next time you login. 
@_date: 2015-02-22 21:29:49
When I was first learning about it all, I had an aha moment when I realized that instead of transferring coins (or slices of a coin) between participants, balances are nothing more than what everyone agrees upon.
What really makes the mechanism special, the Byzantine General's Problem, is that the network is able to achieve consensus - get everyone to agree on everyone's balances - while operating in a hostile environment. Everyone would love to have the network agree that they have a million extra BTC. The fact that everyone agrees on balances while expecting anyone or everyone to try to hack the network into crediting them extra BTC was a groundbreaking moment in computer science history. 
tl;dr coins don't move anywhere. Everyone agrees amongst themselves how much BTC is sitting in each address, which was thought to be impossible to achieve (until it was achieved).
@_date: 2015-02-08 10:44:46


You may call this convoluted, but if I wanted to send BTC via SMS to a friend who was already familiar, I'd generate an address at bitaddress in Chrome right on my phone. Copy and paste the private key to an SMS message to send to my buddy. Then copy the BTC address to the clipboard. Flip to Mycelium, send my payment plus 2c to the BTC address in the clipboard. 
My buddy receives the private address in SMS, copies it to the clipboard and adds it as a legacy account in Mycelium, right from the clipboard. Once my send gets a confirmation, he can sweep it to his HD wallet. I included an extra 2c to cover his fee to sweep it.
It is functionally identical to loading and handing him a paper wallet, except over SMS.

I am isolating BTC into groups that were bought together. I am absolutely not commingling BTC with different cost bases. I studied for over a year before purchasing my first BTC. I can prove the purchase date and cost basis and spend date and cost basis for each satoshi that has moved through my wallets, and prove that all BTC spent was spent at a lower cost basis, and that all BTC bought together stayed together in a single address while I held it. No commingling. No mixing cost bases. Never spend BTC that has risen in value. 
I appreciate your concern. I spent over a year making sure I have a painless way to buy and spend (or hold if I bought it too cheap). I think the key is being able to prove when I bought, where I held and when I spent using a different single address for each bundle of BTC. I'm not just periodically loading and spending from the same HD wallet. You're absolutely correct that that would be disastrous. 
That being said, I've only purchased $150 worth of BTC ever, so we're not talking about big balances here. It's more about experiencing the phenomenon.

There are a few things that are different. I understand you also don't have the secure, encrypted chat function in the local buy/sell feature. We can encrypt chats using pseudonyms between just the sending and receiving wallets during a private sale. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 11:34:57
I'm led to think not necessarily so, considering how long they've had Chat Secure, a secure chat client that uses Off the Record messaging to provide secure chat using Perfect Forward Secrecy over the Google and AIM chat systems. 
The clients destroy and subsequently negotiate new keys after every message sent (!!) or every 10 seconds, whichever comes first. There is nothing anyone can do - even under threat of violence or incarceration - to decrypt any message ever sent in the past or in the future. The only giveaway is that if Google is ever subpoenaed to produce chat logs, they are filled with useless encrypted messages. The clients even send clutter (with new keys!) when no chats are being sent!

I often say it's about the same as getting struck by lightning while being attacked by a shark. And even then less than 0.5% of the addresses with balances likely have more than $100 (totally made up, but may even be over estimating by several orders of magnitude).

In reading some other Amazon posts in there, they also suggest amz2btc.com as well as on Reddit. I'm sure you can find a way. Just know that most sales tend to run around 80% of the face value (i.e. $40 worth of BTC for every $50 in card value).

Yes, it uses the EMV chip that has been on bank cards in Europe for a number of years but is just now coming to the US this year. 
It uses the strongest commercial encryption and security technologies that have been trusted by the world's financial services companies for years. The security mechanism is protected by NDA but whose behavior can be tested against a published open spec. 
When it originally shipped, the Nano used a cipher chart that was customized to each unique device. When signing a transaction, the device (which only knows about your paired cipher card) asks you to enter a few characters off your cipher card. Many people felt that wasn't enough so Ledger has been developing a new firmware and mobile app that moves the 2FA function to your cell. 
Some people will complain that even the new process lends itself to hacking but they don't realize that malware would need to hack the phone, the PC into which you've inserted the Ledger AND the specialized security chip on the Nano ALL AT THE SAME TIME. The Nano makes the checksum and verifies the counter that you supply on the cellphone. Even if the PC and the phone were hacked to show a different address, the Nano would not sign a transaction that does not match the internally generated checksum. 
Now, I'm a 20+ year Linux guy, so I get open source. I also understand the security provided by the EMV chip. Add to that it fits on my keychain and is smaller than all my keys and it cost me $30 cash at the Miami Bitcoin Conference. It's an amazing device, especially for the price.

It carries through to the traditional financial system as well. Our equivalent of the Bitcoin network is called the Federal Reserve, with capital letters. That is the name of the oversight organization. Our unit of currency is the dollar (lower case), abbreviated as USD. It is not the name of a person or organization. It is an object, whose name denotes its value. We also have portions of that unit, including the half dollar, quarter, dime, nickel and penny, all in lower case. 
In the case of Bitcoin, the oversight organization is hosted by the network of miners and full nodes. That's why it is considered fully decentralized. The oversight organization is actually a set of rules encoded into software that take priority based on the number of participants running each version of the software. The participants elect the oversight plan by selecting the version of software that has implemented the rules each participant wants to see enacted and enforced. It's a rather abstract theory. The oversight may not be as apparent as it is in traditional finance, but it is there nonetheless. 
I hope that helps, but I understand if it does not :)
@_date: 2017-05-18 10:33:07


No additional effort? The calculations are not additive. You don't start with a solved empty block and then add transactions to it. They try to solve empty blocks for a few seconds while bundling up transactions and then work on solving blocks with transactions. If the hash you tried on the full block doesn't qualify, you throw it out and try another hash. 
If you found $22,000 before the rest of the mining world did, would you throw it away in hopes that you might start all over and be lucky enough to beat everyone else again, this time to $30,000? No way. You take the $22,000 now and try to find $30,000 about 30 seconds from now.
This is why I originally said you're getting close to the root of the issue. People say the miners are acting in the best interest of the entire ecosystem, but they fail the test when they are lucky enough to be presented with a zero tx block. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 12:21:37


This date keeps coming up and will keep coming up in these kinds of discussions. I try to remind myself that the decline is actually going to go much faster. We've only seen the 50 and 25 BTC reward eras so far. Looking at the controlled supply charts again, I'm reminded that the last 40 BTC will start being mined just 69 years from now in 2084.
Let that sink in for a minute. Within 70 years, we are going to slow down from 25 BTC mined about every 10 minutes to the 55 YEAR run to mine the last 40 BTC. The fact that it is going to stop in 2140 should be of far less significance now.

Thanks for the bits, glad I could help stir up some ideas.
The network that LibertyX uses is called QPay. When you buy BTC from LibertyX, you're not buying BTC directly. The process is equivalent to paying a bill at a check cashing place. You ask the teller to go into QPay, locate LibertyX, and indicate how much you want to pay. Each payment can be for $50, $100, or $300. They take your money and print out a receipt. Written on that receipt is a PIN code. Visit LibertyX.com/store, log into your account and indicate that you want to redeem a PIN. Go to your Bitcoin wallet and copy your deposit address to the clipboard. Return to the browser, type in the PIN code found on the receipt and paste in the deposit address. Click redeem and the transfer begins almost immediately. You can cite libertyx.com for all those details.
You may wish to research how the unbanked pay their bills and use prepaid cellular via these little specialty shops. Buying LibertyX PIN codes for BTC uses the same exact mechanism in many of the same stores. There are numerous networks that vendors join to allow walk-in payments. QPay is just one of them.
I understand your point about the unbanked staying outside of the traditional financial system by primarily using cash and getting paid under the table. I would think not reporting capital gains earned on a property investment (which is exactly what gains earned on BTC are) is a more serious offense than not reporting traditional income. When you don't report income and get ill, you cannot claim the unreported income when calculating your disability payments. When you don't report investment income, that's a different story.
If you receive cash and stick it under your mattress, it is not earning interest. It is also likely not gaining in value due to inflation. If you receive BTC and hold onto it, it may triple in value before you get around to spending it. On the other hand it may sink precipitously in value during the interim, and that's a whole other part of the essay.
Finally, to deepen your understanding of how BTC is an investment and not cash (if you need to do so!) search Google for "fincen bitcoin", "irs bitcoin" and "crs reports bitcoin" (no quotes for any of the searches, of course). They will turn up short, easy to digest documents describing how the government views Bitcoin and how they want you to treat gains earned by buying and selling or spending BTC.

That's the point of Proof of Existence. I can prove the data that was on it, complete with a verifiable bar code at a precise moment in time (before any other time that anyone can try to prove that they completed it). It's not just a cryptographic hash of the proof. It's the hash loaded onto the Blockchain with a timestamp that can't be faked. Anything anyone else claims will be after I proved that it existed with my info first.

That's why I keep multiple wallets in Mycelium tagged with the exchange rate at purchase. I only spend from wallets when the exchange rate is close to BUT BELOW the rate at which I bought the BTC. I never realize any gains and never lose too much capital. I also never have to go through any of this. Notice how most of the automated systems take a transaction dump from Coinbase. It's not so easy for people who manage their own coins. 
Always spend at or below your purchase price and you never have to care. If your BTC takes off, just hold onto it and buy some more at recent prices.

I haven't activated it yet. I refuse to use the decoder card as a 2FA, and I've been waiting for them to release the new firmware. I use Chrome all day, so I'm fine with the premise of it. I need real 2FA before I'll start using it though.
I think it will leap ahead of Trezor for one third the price once the new firmware ships. It was a no brainer for $30 though. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 09:16:36
Posters are making a big leap and talking extremes around here. The fee, if it applies in your scenario, is $5,000 to file an application in order to interact with New Yorkers. A lot of people don't realize the role New York plays in global finance, and think it's just some guy meddling. They've been taught that on the Internet in this new globalized world, everyone is truly equal. Therefore, they're making the leap that if one state can require this, then every state can. A $5,000 fee to seek permission to operate in all 50 states would cost you $250,000 if the 49 other states declared themselves the real world's center of finance and decided to draft similar regulations.

Agreed and understood. Rereading my comment, I can see how I imply that Coinbase and BitPay won't touch due to the huge volumes of cash and volatility, not due to the banking regulations. Thanks for clarifying it as I did not finish my thought for that sentence.
I've been trying to figure out how to setup a Bitcoin ATM or money service bureau next door, but at some point you're relying upon a bank to take the cash. Can drug money ever get "clean"? Dunno.

LibertyX. If you ever wanted to walk into a store and buy BTC with cash, that's how you do it. Instant transfers, no fee for the first $1,000. No meeting people in weird places (other than check cashing joints ;) ). No mailing in pictures of you holding your ID. No web wallet that can be shut down because they don't like where BTC they sold you eventually ended up. You tell the cashier how much you want to buy then you tell LibertyX where to deposit the BTC in a real wallet that you control.

Fair enough, but you didn't even hint towards resorting to physical violence. All of your examples were logical or technical in nature, not just a stickup.
I think it will be a long time before someone asks to look at my keychain during a robbery. Compare the physical characteristics of a Trezor and a Ledger Nano. A Trezor is quite obviously something electronic, like the guy who claimed it was stolen from around his neck by the cops during a stop. A Ledger Nano, on the other hand, looks just like a 20 year old USB jump drive with a hole drilled through it for a keyring. I would be AMAZED if within the next 20-30 years a) I find myself getting robbed, and b) they demand to see my keychain to see if I have something on it that looks like it might be valuable.
Now, you may reply again saying that it may not be random -- that I may be targeted if I make it obvious that I'm carrying BTC on my keychain. If that's your point, then so be it.

@_date: 2015-10-18 21:30:56
Since you're in the US, you can use LibertyX. They only take cash and transfer real BTC directly into a wallet that you control.
1) Install Mycelium or Breadwallet on your phone, depending on the platform. Learn how to identify your current deposit address and copy and paste it into your browser. 
2) Sign up at LibertyX and give them your identity details (no bank account required).
3) Find a location and buy enough BTC to cover your needs. An ACE location will let you specify exactly how much you want to buy, but a QPay store will only let you buy in chunks no smaller than $50 (so you'll need $150 for $105). You'll hand the cashier cash, and they'll print a receipt for you. Go to the LibertyX website, select Redeem a PIN, and then copy and paste your current BTC deposit address in the appropriate field. Enter the PIN found on the receipt and click Submit. 
4) Switch back to your wallet app and you should see your BTC coming in almost immediately. 
Because of the fact that they don't manage your wallet for you, a) it's your responsibility to secure your funds, and b) you can actually specify any BTC deposit address. No one's going to know who actually owns that address. They'll only know that you placed those funds in there. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 02:19:42
1) You're right. That's what sidechains are for. See ChangeTip. Plenty of micro transactions that are directly compatible with Bitcoin. 
2) I use LibertyX. No fees from fiat to Bitcoin for the first $1,000. 1% after that. So no, there are no steep fees ever to get out of fiat for most of the US.
3) Can't fix that without broader adoption. How do you convince a farmer in the Andes to use a new currency because he can use it to get a burger in Miami if he ever goes there? There needs to be FAR broader adoption for the remittance market to use a catch phrase like, "Just keep it in Bitcoin!" It'll probably help in Venezuela where people buy dollars on street corners after the govt tells the banks they've sold enough for the day. 
@_date: 2015-02-24 09:44:16
Trying to be a little less sarcastic here. Yes, you will make a little money... after you've spent a LOT. 
People who spend about $1,000 on equipment and $500/mo on electricity might earn about $20-50/mo in BTC. Mining on a personal scale hasn't been profitable for a almost two years now. 
@_date: 2015-02-21 18:24:20
Breadwallet is also a special case because they take advantage of enhanced hardware encryption that was introduced with the iPhone 6. This, like the chip on the Ledger wallets, provides a higher level of security than software alone. I believe the iPhone only stores the private keys in highly secure environment while the Ledger actually generates and signs transactions offline in the secure element. The iPhone's enhanced security is stronger than ever, but unless it signs transactions offline in a certified secure storage and processing area, it's still not as strong as the Ledger.
The Trezor also creates and signs transactions offline, but does it using software that is certified by the "million eyes" approach.

Get a Ledger Nano and put it on your keychain. Wait for the new firmware to emerge from Beta test. Once it does, activate the Nano on a clean PC and download and upgrade the firmware. Install the companion app on your phone and pair the phone to the Nano. Like all modern solutions, make sure you write down your seed words. 
Install Mycelium for Android or Breadwallet for iOS. Again, write down your seed words - these will be different. Keep a little BTC on your phone if you spend some day to day or use it for demos.
When your phone balance gets a little low, stick your Nano into a USB port on your PC and transfer some BTC to your phone. If you wait for the new firmware, you will be prompted on your phone to confirm the address where your Nano is about to send the BTC. Even if malware somehow infected your PC and your phone, the Nano still won't authorize a false transaction because the checksums will fail in the Nano hardware.

I was thinking more along the lines of making the whole island off-chain. Remember ChangeTip? The vast majority of their transactions never hit the broader blockchain. The addresses mostly just moved balances amongst themselves. You can provide coverage through mesh and periodically true up with the real blockchain as people bring microSD cards on and off the island.
A visitor can easily inject millions of dollars' worth into the island economy by carrying a single transaction that just needs to be broadcast on the island network. You are correct, of course, that it would be difficult to carry the island live on the blockchain, but luckily you don't need to do that. Just run enough Pi 3's to create a mesh and enough nodes and miners to maintain the island-specific blockchain.
Now, the authorities shutting it down is another matter. Sure you can run the mesh on hidden WiFi and Pi Zeroes are making that easier, but it is still something to overcome. I'm thinking of tossing 4-inch cubes covered in solar panels with WiFi antennas on the flat rooftops.

On the My Money page, look for three bars that show you x amount deposited out of a certain limit over time: day, week and month I believe. The daily deposit limit always shows close to your current balance out of a certain max. So mine showed $2.18 / $5 for instance. Then I complained about the low max and the limit was raised so now it shows $2.18 / $15. What does your daily limit show? I guess the only way to limit your deposit amount is to return the excess to your sending address after the fact. That's how I would do it.

IMHO that place is _primed_ for a crypto/blockchain explosion. Not just because of the fact that the citizens have unfettered use of crypto, but look at the government, too. I work for IBM but not in the Blockchain business. I'd still love to be part of a team who moves there and starts to port government agencies into DAOs. Think of the transparency and cost effectiveness. They actually have the opportunity to recreate portions of a functioning government in a DAO or series of DAOs.
This can also help with the pension issue. Shave 1 month off the pension payments and convert one of the 11 remaining months to pay out in crypto. They might even come out ahead if the price continues to rise! Then push businesses across the island to accept Bitcoin or other coins, since no one has to track cost basis or calculate capital gains.
Imagine blockchain permeating every aspect of society there, both in obvious ways as well as not-so-obvious ways.

In the US, LibertyX gives you a 5 minute signup, minimal KYC, $1,000 a day, no fee on the first $1,000, thousands of walk in locations across the country and instant transfers since the buys are cash only. It's like having thousands of LocalBitcoins sellers standing around waiting for you to walk up to them during extended business hours. 
Best of all, no waiting five days to find out what rate you got or that they canceled your order.

Yes, exactly. They only publish the hash of digital files so as to not clog up the blockchain. Took a picture.

The website was dynamic and automatically updated itself throughout the process. Very nice. I was impressed.

I'm beginning to wonder if they don't actually block deposits over their declared limits or return overages to the sending address. I've always respected the top line and never tried to just ignore it. If it says I can't deposit any more than $5, I just blindly accepted that.

The small corner stores and tiny bodegas can benefit from the reduced transaction fees, allowing the shop owners to keep more money in their pockets. 
Additionally, keep this in mind. LibertyX is one of the easiest and safest ways to buy BTC using only cash in the US. You just walk into thousands of retailers across the country and buy BTC. No scheduling meetups. No risk of getting robbed by an unknown third party. No risk of the seller absconding with your cash. Within five minutes, you can start buying up to $2,500 per week. 
This is particularly relevant to your essay because the retailers that sell LibertyX BTC are those commonly used by the unbanked population to pay utility bills. So one of the easiest ways to buy BTC in the US without a bank account already happens to be tightly integrated with the way the unbanked move money. I've always said that BitPay should use the LibertyX location map as a guide for where to focus their efforts to gain new customers. Every strip mall with a LibertyX location should have at least one shop or restaurant that accepts Bitcoin via BitPay. If they did, you'd see growth of adoption by brick and mortar businesses in urban centers long before the suburbs kick in. 
Being tax season, though, it would probably be best to touch on the quagmire that is the current state of IRS guidance. Do you really think that the unbanked are going to track the purchase and sale (spend) dates as well as the cost basis of all BTC they could start using in their daily lives? If you don't use Coinbase or another service that dumps a transaction history, it can be quite an exercise that I think few would follow. That could put large segments of the population at risk of being non-compliant. I beg the makers of Mycelium to incorporate a transaction dump feature into the app, either by CSV export or Wi-Fi or cloud printing. That would be a huge leap forward. 
I, like many, saw immediately that the IRS regulations effectively killed Bitcoin as a day to day currency in the US. I think that is the elephant in the room. That the sudden widespread use of Bitcoin in the US could lead to its demise. Imagine the reaction of an urban poor person realizing that they were supposed to record and report the details of every transaction that resulted in a capital gain of more than 50c? 
Now imagine them, like me, using LibertyX and Mycelium. If they're not extremely careful with their tracking, they would never be able to go back and figure out exactly when they bought BTC, each time they spent it, which BTC they spent (yes, that matters) and how much they made or lost in each transaction. It'll just take one horrific tax year to decimate a segment of the population and send everyone else running for the hills. 
Edit: Seeing "in university" tells me you're not in the US. The UK has a similar way to buy BTC in, I believe, over 25,000 retailers across the kingdom. One key difference is that in the US, LibertyX offers among the best price (Bitstamp + 0% on the first $1,000, 1% after) while in the UK, this approach nets you some of the worst pricing available. Just about any other method of buying BTC offers a better price.

Three questions:
1) Are there regulations guiding the security practices around POS terminals, at least in the US? Or could someone combine a basic PC with a USB cash drawer and specially built screen for POS situations and call it a legal cash register?
2) If any COTS components could qualify and you're describing the typical parts that could be used to host your POS terminal software, does your POS terminal software also include full functionality for handling cash? What about credit/debit cards? Are there generic EMV chip and pin terminals available at reasonable prices to the general public?
3 Does your software include CSV exports of transaction details suitable for import into accounting software like QuickBooks?
For the small shop owner, I'm wondering if it would be worth it to convince them to add a live Internet drop into their store, or if it would be more cost effective to just turn on tethering on their cell phone to provide the needed Internet connection to your POS terminal.

You're right, the Blockchain content doesn't demonstrate sole ownership. It's the actual image content - my name, address and phone number written in pen on the back that shows it existed in that form.
To be really tinfoil hat like, I should have taken pictures of me handing him the cash, him handing me the slip, me signing the back, a pre and post signature version of a contract releasing me from all obligations, a picture of my coworker and I signing and counter signing said contract and then signed and encrypted ALL of those files and put them all in a signed and encrypted zip. THEN I should have hashed that signed and encrypted zip and placed THAT in the Blockchain with Proof of Existence.

Well, the technology is based on being able to prove that you control certain addresses without needing to reveal the secret key protecting the balances. In a Stingray scenario, they can likely prove that you control a certain address by capturing transactions that spend BTC out of those addresses. That's part of the reason it is so important to use an HD wallet that never reuses addresses. Even if the Stingray does capture a transaction or two off your phone, it can't take that little bit of information and figure out exactly which other coins you've spent or may have. They can trace the route that all the coins took before eventually arriving at a wallet you control, but unless they capture you spending money from other addresses, they can't necessarily identify you as the ultimate source for the BTC.
In other words, every time you spend BTC, the balance you want to send goes to the recipient's address, but the extra amount in the source set of funds you're spending (the unspent outputs) are sent to another brand new address. If someone only captures one transaction from you sending BTC from one address to two new ones, it's very difficult to tell which one is the amount you intended to send to someone else and which is the leftover balance you wanted to keep in a different, new address. That is unless and until they capture another transaction from you sending BTC out from one of the two addresses that received BTC from your first transaction. They can only likely untangle transactions that they capture while you're using the Stingray -- they likely can't put together a picture of all your financial dealings just by looking at one or two transactions.

In the US, gifts from an individual donor are not taxable until $14,000 and even then must be declared by the donor. That's part of how r/millionairemakers came to be. Unless you want to treat this like a business then, yes, it will be income. Verify everything with a tax professional.
BTW, sweet gig. I can only imagine waking up on the 15th and 30th of each month to $5k more in my Bitcoin wallet. Install Mycelium and Gyft and you may never have to work to buy anything again.  Back up your seed words (by writing them down) or you will kill yourself. 
Also watch your balances (and the exchange rate) as you ARE responsible for paying capital gains taxes on the increase in value your BTC earns while you held it. So if you get paid $5,000 today at $650 per BTC but later spend $100 on a day when BTC is worth $1300, you will owe 23-43% on $50 the following April since that's how much it went up in value while you held onto it. The percentage due is based on how long you held it (less than or more than a year).

I have had two successful buys in four tries. First try failed because the shop dropped the QPay network a year earlier. Second try went perfectly. Third try failed when the girl at the counter said her boss only lets her click on (meaning process payments for) T-Mobile. I just drove 10 minutes down the road to another store where the transaction went perfectly. 
When the store is still on the network and the employee knows how to work the QPay system, it's a beautiful thing. Two minutes to sign up and you can immediately start buying $1,500 worth a week. When you make a buy and tell them where to send the BTC (any real wallet, by the way, not some concoction of theirs), the transfer starts just as quickly as any phone to phone transfer. 
I've often said it's like LocalBitcoins, except a couple thousand people are standing around across the country waiting for you to walk up to them and buy for cash. No scheduling meetings. No physical security or reputation concerns. Bitstamp + 0% for the first $1,000, 1% after that.

Please see Trezor or Ledger. The setup uses 12 or 24 words in a specific sequence to generate thousands (millions?) of private key/bitcoin address pairs designed to be used once apiece. You only tell the devices where you want to send a balance and how much to send. The devices construct a transaction completely offline, sign it, and send the signed transaction to a device which in turn delivers it to the network for processing. The private keys are never ever shown to anyone, not even to you, the holder of the funds. If you can't access the keys, they can't be stolen.
Your concerns are correct if you actually touch or manage the private keys, but the safest ways to store your keys involve you never seeing or touching the keys.
So again: you request a transaction, certify through a secondary device that you actually requested it, and then you broadcast the transaction for processing.

An example I often give is a restaurant that is dabbling in Bitcoin without using BitPay. When the server drops off a bill at a table, the customer says they want to pay with Bitcoin. The server goes back to the register, and prints a new wallet on a Piper. They tear the wallet in half, staple the public half to the bill and drop the private half into a lock box. The customer pays and leaves just like they would with cash.
At the end of the day, the restaurant scans all the public addresses that were printed to ensure they have a balance that meets (and hopefully exceeds) the balance on the associated bill. Any excess is a tip for the server. If the restaurant went the SUPER cheap way and posted one QR code near the register or taped the same one inside each bill fold, they would never be able to figure out which bills were paid and how much was given in tips to each server. That assumes that the restaurant sees more than one Bitcoin transaction a week!
Take it to the extreme opposite and think about Bob Evans. Every bill is left on the table and has a barcode at the bottom. Say they gave everyone the option of paying by Bitcoin by also placing a QR at the bottom of every bill. Every customer has to get their bill scanned at the register on the way out today. With Bitcoin, the customer would pay at their table and when the cashier scans the bill, the register would show them that it was already paid and how much tip goes to the server. You definitely want single use addresses in those scenarios.
Same for those Uber drivers who post a QR code for tips in Bitcoin. Do they realize that everyone can see exactly how much they've been tipped and likely still have sitting on their phone right now? Doubtful, IMHO.

Back in my early days trying to visualize it's usefulness, I used a scenario that included the homeless and a farmer's market. There's a section of Santa Monica, California where a bunch of nearly homeless people live in campers and cars.
By giving out deactivated cellphones and printing QRs large enough to post outside the vehicle, locals could donate directly to the homeless. Then when the weekly farmer's market is held, all it takes is one seller or neighborhood business to provide Wi-Fi in the market area. The homeless would then buy some fresh food straight off the farms using BTC, and we all know the farmers could use BitPay to receive the payment in USD. 
This also has the added benefit of their not easily being able to buy alcohol with the funds.
That was an early scenario I used to get my head around how to distribute and store BTC while providing fresh food to the nearly homeless and unbanked. Anyone around the world could donate and the recipient doesn't need to know how much BTC he or she has until the market opens and the Wi-Fi is turned on for them.

I've often said that schools should use blockchain technology to run elections. Give every student a starter balance, and let kids earn more through extra credit. Then the candidates can put QR codes on their posters. Whenever a candidate does or says something that a voter likes, then a voter can send some bits to the candidate. At the end of election period, the candidate with the highest balance wins the seat. Doesn't have to be Bitcoin, it can even be a custom designed coin used only at the school. Maybe even include smart contracts that include earning votes through community service. If any school administrators read this, I think it's a huge opportunity.

I also keep a Ledger Nano on my keychain, and I'm dying for them to enable 2FA by cellphone. I travel all over the place for work and I'm rarely more than a few feet away from my laptop 24x7. Once I'm willing to use my Ledger, I'll be able to transfer most of my balances to the Ledger and just reload my phone when I know I'm going to spend some BTC. It will be so quick and easy to move BTC between my Ledger and my phone once that 2FA feature is enabled. The Ledger uses a security chip trusted for years by banks to store your private keys and safely generate transactions inside the secure element. You can then safely use even the most virus laden machine to verify and broadcast transactions without worry. They have released all of the source code they are allowed to release, but the secure element central to their security mechanism is protected by NDAs.

The worst part about this whole discussion is that it creates a vicious circle. You are responsible to report the buy and sell side of every transfer of BTC out of your possession that has resulted in earning more than 50c in "free money" during the time you held.
If you pay your taxes with BTC that has dropped in value, you are unnecessarily sending more than you need to. If you pay with BTC that has risen in value, you are now generating a new reportable event for next year's tax bill!
So imagine you are one of the lucky few who mined early in the 50 BTC reward era, and you are loaded up with BTC that cost way less than a penny when you mined it. That means you must report and pay the feds 28c of every dollar's worth of BTC you spend all day, every day from that original collection. It wasn't free money you're spending. It was taxable gains.
If you're independently wealthy on BTC and pay for everything with it, you will have a ridiculous tax bill. 28c of every dollar's worth of BTC you spent last year. Then if you go to pay your tax bill with that with BTC, too? Yikes. Under the current regulations, trying to live on BTC will make it all go away within a couple of years, depending on how much you have and how frugal you are. 
People point at me and laugh when I explain that I only spend BTC when the current rate is just below the rate at which I bought. So long as I always spend at a (minimal) loss, I never have to tell anyone about my transactions but I also don't lose a ton of money for the convenience of using it like a currency. I have legacy wallets in Mycelium that I've tagged with the safe spending level, and I tag each transaction with the purpose, exchange rate and amount in USD.
I kind of like the range we've been stuck in lately. It lets me "buy high, spend low", removing the need to report anything while also not overspending by too much.

Other way around. I've always been limited in my deposit amounts by QR code. $5 at first then $15. I don't know about limits when buying via the Coinbase link. Also should be no limits to tips received. Only by depositing BTC via QR. That's why the $75 first deposit shocked me.

@_date: 2015-02-21 17:39:32
Yes, I failed to mention how great support has been each time. If you're the first one to buy at a location you need to write to tell them how it went in order to claim an extra $5 worth of BTC for free. When I wrote to them to tell them a site was no longer participating, they deleted it from the map and gave me the trailblazer bonus anyway. When I wrote another time to tell them that the name of a business listed on their site was the formal name of the business on the paperwork and NOT the name on the outside of the building, they updated their map within minutes.
Support has been great all along.

I tend to take the opposite route. I like to go to places featured on the Airbitz app and specifically tell them that I came because they accept Bitcoin. My very first purchase ever was for coffee near the stadium where the Bitcoin Bowl college football game was played back on December 26th. They were supposed to close 45 minutes earlier and were just about to turn the lock when I arrived. I told her "we drove here from Philly because you accept Bitcoin!" She opened right back up and welcomed us into her shop. It was a blast and the people there were super cool.
The first time I tried to pay for dinner with BTC was later that night when I tried to join a scheduled Bitcoin Meetup. I never found the group, but when I went to pay, the BitPay app crashed. No one had written down their BitPay credentials, not even the owner! The guy who was designated to process payments in Bitcoin started to look really frazzled and was literally afraid to ask if I could pay in fiat. I calmed him down and promptly paid, no problem.

I often travel as part of a group for months at a time. At one particular gig, each time four or more of us would go out to dinner together, someone invariably needed to do an ATM withdrawal. Everyone would pay him/her cash for their meal and he/she would pay the whole bill with their credit or debit card. That would be an interesting way to acquire some BTC. Everyone pays one person cash for dinner. That person pays with Bitcoin and then hits a LibertyX afterward to reload their wallet.

I know we were all trying to help on this thread, but I just wanted to point out that with SPV clients, the thin clients that OP was referring to, rely upon intermediary servers that interact in turn with the blockchain. The thin clients themselves don't interact directly with the blockchain or even Blockchain.info's servers as it appears you may have thought. They have their own layer of specialty servers that act as middlemen. There was a discussion in here recently about how the Electrum clients send dozens of addresses to the intermediate Electrum servers for processing and that if you truly want to protect your privacy you should run your own Electrum "middle tier" servers and use encryption everywhere.
OP didn't yet understand the role that word lists play in key generation in HD wallets and was worried that if the intermediate servers that are tied to a specific app go away, his clients would die and he would suddenly lose access to all his funds. I think he now has a grasp on the fact that the word lists can be reused across compliant SPV apps and that any compliant client will regenerate the key list from the word list and start uploading the keys to the dedicated intermediate servers for processing. So no, the clients don't interact directly with the blockchain. They interact with specialized servers that in turn interact with the blockchain. Luckily, you can use your word list to start using a different app to manage your funds, so long as it has implemented the same standard.
@_date: 2015-02-05 15:32:20
For me personally, I just tag every purchase and spend with the reason, bitstamp exchange rate and the value in USD at the time of the transaction. I also start a new wallet each time I purchase BTC and tag the wallet with the exchange rate. Then I know at a glance which wallets are safe for spending because their value has declined while I held the BTC. If I need to spend but don't have any BTC that is close to (but still below) the current rate for the last few days, I just hit a LibertyX to pick some up and spend it right away before the price moves too much. Always spend it at a lower rate than when you bought it and you never have to report any transactions.
To answer your question, though, if I were running a business, I would check out the Bitcoin integration in Quickbooks.

More like, good luck finding a seller. You are trying to use money you can take back for (90? 180?) days to buy money that the seller can't take back ever once it's been transferred to you.

I just bought from a LibertyX retailer in Manhattan. BC Wireless at 36th and Madison (tiny store, entrance on Madison at the corner). LibertyX changed their primary approach to sales somewhat recently and BC Wireless is using the format that LibertyX will be using going forward.
Customers setup the buy on their phone and show the proprietor a 6 digit code. Customer hands over cash, proprietor enters the cash tendered and the code. Bitcoin starts transferring into the customer's Bitcoin wallet almost instantly.
Seriously, go visit the store and ask them about it. They're cool guys.

Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) means buying a (typically small) amount at fairly frequent intervals, regardless of the price. I do work in the tech industry, but that is not a requirement in the US. If you get your paycheck deposited directly into your bank account, you can redirect it to a company called Bitwage. Then you'll tell Bitwage how much BTC you want to buy as a percentage of each payment and (if not 100% in BTC), where to send the rest of your paycheck as a regular bank deposit. Anyone who has Direct Deposit for their paycheck can buy a little BTC automatically with a portion of each paycheck.
My employer has a massive community of traveling employees, so they actually give us two, independently configurable, direct deposit streams -- one for our regular paycheck and one for travel expense reimbursement. I have my regular paycheck go to my bank in cash and I have my travel expenses go to Bitwage who then changes 100% of every reimbursement into BTC for me.
I normally spend about 35-40 weeks a year flying somewhere for work and staying in hotels. Any money I spend during my typical trips comes back to me as BTC. So that means I normally buy a little BTC 35-40 times a year.
There are many benefits to doing it this way:
1. It was my money that is coming back to me as BTC in the first place, so I don't have to count it as income or jump through any accounting hoops (unless and until I spend BTC that has risen in value)
1. I never have to withdraw or wire money from my regular bank account to buy BTC so there's no risk of my bank shutting down my bank account for buying BTC. We haven't seen those posts around here for a while, but a couple years ago, major banks were closing accounts of customers any time they were wiring money out to buy BTC. I never take money out of my bank to buy BTC. I use money that my bank has never seen so they have no reason to shut down my account. I convert 100% of my smaller direct deposit feed into BTC, so my bank doesn't even see regular deposits coming from Bitwage. All of the money I designate for buying BTC goes to buying BTC. My bank has no indication at all that I'm buying BTC, unlike everyone else who wires money to exchanges or links their bank account with Coinbase.
1. Bitwage doesn't offer web wallets -- all of the BTC that I buy goes directly to my Ledger Nano, where I control the keys. That is the best way to hold BTC.
So I automatically buy a little BTC throughout the year, using money that was my own in the first place (vs new income), using money that my bank never sees, and it automatically appears in my hardware wallet a few weeks after each business trip. So easy.
All of that aside, I'm currently on an assignment close to home so I'm not incurring any travel expenses (and therefore not buying BTC right now). Once I get my next assignment and start traveling again, the BTC purchases will start back up again.
@_date: 2015-02-03 20:31:43

It's not the controller that makes the difference, it's the hashing speed that makes the difference. The USB miners were generally rated in mega hashes, while standalone ASIC hashers are generally rated at giga and tera hash rates.
As is generally said in all similar posts, you should only proceed if you are doing this to learn how to get one up and running and to feel like you are helping the network. If you want to earn BTC, you should expect to spend $500 on a terahash ASIC plus $500 a month on your electric bill. That may net you about $30/mo in BTC. If you want to earn all your money back on it, you can't with the current generation of hardware at the current difficulty level. 
Hashing for profit is only for commercial enterprises now and has been for a year now. Instead, just buy $1,000 worth of BTC the first month and $500 every month thereafter and remind yourself how much money you would have lost if you went with a home setup that actually earns more than $1/mo in BTC. If you don't have the money to do it this way, then you'll never have the money to hash.

Whenever this comes up, the usual answer is that since they are already operating in the outer fringes of federal law -- hoping that the feds will continue to _not prosecute_ -- the last thing they want to do is attract way more attention by storing their hard earned money in a parallel banking system that can easily draw even more attention. Not to mention possibly having a third of their money vanish overnight. From what I understand, BitPay and Coinbase won't touch them. I'd wonder if any of them have approached LibertyX since they specialize in cash-only deals. I can't help but feel like LibertyX would offer the same reaction, &lt;skeptical kid meme&gt;.

Paying the mortgage or rent and utilities may be tough in the US unless you can find a roommate willing to act as a payment gateway for you. He may have to register as an MSB ;) You may also convince a landlord to sign up for BitPay. 
As for food, clothing, small (and large) appliances, the Gyft app lets you buy gift cards at over 220 retailers and restaurants using Bitcoin. That includes Target, Amazon and CVS Pharmacy. Super Target stores have a regular supermarket right in the store. If you can't find virtually every type of consumable and non consumable product between those three stores (even prescription medication!) then you're not really trying.
There are even a couple of car dealerships outside Miami that accept BTC for new and used cars. I haven't heard of an insurance company accepting payment that way, though. 
A week or two ago, someone even reported success buying a Shell gas station gift card with a GameStop gift card purchased via Gyft. So even the gas problem has been solved. 
So yes, if you're willing to make sacrifices in brand names and occasionally working a little harder to make it happen, you absolutely can live daily life on BTC in America today. Reporting every time your BTC gained more than 50c in value while you held it will likely be enough to make you hang yourself in your closet, unfortunately.

I don't know which is worse.
Think of a (hypothetical) kid who mined throughout high school. Mining income is taxable, but in the early days BTC was below $0 and thus not reportable. Kid mines for four years, goes off to college. Graduates four years later. Now, 8 years after he started mining BTC is at $1,300 and he's a paper millionaire. He buys a $120,000 Tesla with the "free" money he made in high school. 
Boom. 
Next April, he owes an additional $30,000 because that free money wasn't free after all. He realizes from then on that every $1 he spends of the free money triggers a 23 cent bill from Uncle Sam the following April. You can even pay your tax bill with BTC but guess what? Selling THAT BTC triggers ANOTHER tax bill the following year. It just compounds and accelerates your depletion. You can get locked up in mental anguish not wanting to spend any of the millions of dollars sitting right there on your phone.
Bottom line, capital gains is not free money.

They want to know about all gains over 50c. It doesn't matter how much was transacted, only the gains earned while the BTC was held. You are not required to report losses, but you may be leaving money on the table.

I'm of the opinion that the best way to buy is through dollar cost averaging. And the easiest way to DCA is with Bitwage. You send your direct deposit paycheck to them, then specify how much of it you want to receive in crypto, how much you want to receive in fiat, and where to send each. Done.

I was a bit dismissive when looking at how young their CEO is. It was a little rocky getting through the approvals and setup, but boy it has been smooth ever since. My employer is so huge they run their own direct deposit, so I didn't have a provider name to give BW. Then BW asked for more ID before ultimately approving me. They needed a driver's license selfie, a utility bill, and passport scan.
You can receive your entire deposit in BTC, a split between BTC and fiat for $10/mo, or split up your BTC into ~35 other cryptos or fiat currencies for another small fee. I have multiple direct deposit feeds, so I take 100% of my smaller one in BTC as that's the cheapest option. They also support depositing into HD wallets, so no two deposits hit the same address. I send it all straight to an HD wallet dedicated to it on my Ledger Nano which I then add as a Watch Only wallet in Mycelium on my phone.
I get a notice at work that my direct deposit was sent. A few days later I get an email from BW that they've processed a deposit and a day or two later I see the deposit in Mycelium. So smooth.

Wait before you go to spend on the BTC side because until protection is implemented, the receiving party for your coins can replay the transaction on the BCC side and thus take the same amount of BCC from you without your knowledge. Don't spend on the BTC side until we are assured of replay protection or you safely split your coins (move your BCC to new address independent of your BTC address).

You can track which address has ever held each Satoshi, back to the beginning. Legally, sure, you can "hit the reset button" but technically, no you can never erase its history. If it was ever tagged as being held by a known drug dealer, it will forever be known as once having been held by a drug dealer. And if you ever hold it, you can be flagged as one, two, or x number of hops away from a drug dealer.
If you unknowingly buy a stolen item off Craigslist using BTC you bought from a KYC exchange and the seller immediately buys something off a DNM with the BTC you spent, you can rest assured you're up for some unwanted attention. Imagine if you deliver the BTC on a paper wallet to protect yourself from phone theft during the transaction and the seller just hand delivers the paper wallet to his dealer without routing it through his own wallet? Your KYC BTC just went straight to a dealer in one hop without even stopping at the drug user along the way.

More established? I'm coming up on a year with BitWage and I thought they were one of the earliest providers in this space. They have worked flawlessly for me going back to the beginning. Once you are approved by BW, you will receive a new routing/account number as you suggest. You will then tell BW how much you want to receive in crypto (and where to deposit it) and how much you want in fiat (and where to deposit it; i.e. your regular bank account). Then you just change the routing/account number on your direct deposit at work and the money flows to the destinations you specified.
It is so easy and carefree working with BW. If you could even talk to your employer about paying you in BTC, you will likely need them to work with a provider that has been doing this for a shorter time and for fewer workers than BW.
BW sets the gold standard if you ask me. I am not an employee nor compensated in any way for this. Just a satisfied customer.

Someone here turned me onto Bitcoin Paranoid. It has a nice alert when the price moves a selectable amount, but the wording is a little off. Instead of saying the price is up or down x number of dollars and/or cents, it reads that it is up or down FROM x number of dollars and/or cents.  Makes it sound like Bitcoin was $0.22 yesterday. 
Other than that, I'm happy with it.

The cost basis is $0 so the entire balance would be capital gains.
The cost of mining it can be used as a wash against the income made by earning it, but the cost basis is the value of the asset at the time it was acquired, regardless of how much it cost to acquire it. Aka $0.

Necroposting here as I'm visiting NYC this week and reading NYC-related posts and comments.
As was already said, Bitcoin is not illegal in New York. Selling BTC in the State of New York is more highly regulated than just about anywhere else on earth. They have added a layer of regulations on top existing federal laws that make it more cumbersome to sell BTC. Outside of that, the new regulations have no impact on Bitcoin. Consumers holding BTC, paying for goods and services with BTC and businesses accepting BTC as a form of payment for goods and services. If you as a consumer want to mine, hold or buy stuff with BTC the regulations changed nothing. If you as a business want to accept BTC for payments, the regulations changed nothing.
If you want to straight up sell BTC for cash or hold BTC on behalf of other people, then you'll have to jump through some extra hoops and prove to regulators that you're serious about being in this business and are able to operate more like a bank or investment firm.
You can't just wake up one day and decide to hold other peoples' money and agree to swap it in and out of BTC (or other cryptocurrencies) based on their placing an order with you. Think of it as "anti Gox" regulation. They thought they could be a bank and fucked it up royally.

I demoed Mycelium to a geek executive friend of mine recently as well. I had been carrying around an unused paper wallet in my real wallet since when folded they fit perfectly in the wallet sized photo pockets. I whipped one out, gave him my phone and my paper wallet and walked him through sending a dollar to it. I explained how I can do that the same exact way to pay my restaurant bill in just about any country where work may take me without exchanging to or from their local currency -- it is the currency for planet Earth. When he realized that there are no boundaries between any two entities on Earth (people or businesses), that's when it hit him. Then I swept the paper wallet back into my phone and ran a sharpie through the private key.

That typically means the fees plus the amount you're trying to send exceed your available balance. Sender pays for transactions here unlike how the recipient pays with credit or debit cards.

Sounds like you got it, so now you can practice with free mobile HD wallet apps. Set them up, write down your words, take note of your first deposit address, uninstall, and reinstall the app (even on a different device if you have one!) Choose to restore a wallet instead of setting up a new one and enter your word list. You should see the same deposit address ready to receive some BTC. 
If you enter the same exact list of words in the same exact order in any software using the same algorithm as the app that gave you the words, the app will derive the same exact addresses every time and check on the blockchain for activity to see your next address due to be used.

That was key to me. No web wallets! Deposits go straight into any single use or HD wallet.

Eek, no way. "Direct Deposit" in the US = ACH, wire transfer, Electronic Funds Transfer, whatever you want to call it. They gave me a new routing number and account number for electronic direct deposit just like any bank would. In fact, it is a bank in California that receives the deposits.
I have two payment streams with my employer, each with their own configuration for electronic transfer. The larger one hits my bank account as cash like always. The smaller one goes to Bitwage who then buys BTC with it. They even support xPubKeys on HD wallets, so each individual payment hits a different address on an HD wallet on my Ledger that I setup just for that purpose.
Don't worry, it's all good. No paper here.

Can you check again? You don't see an Advanced button under the create new HD account button? We have to click Advanced and then Scan.

For now, LibertyX requires you to buy BTC in set amounts ranging from $50 to $300 at a time. If you are the first customer to buy a LibertyX PIN at a certain location and then email LibertyX support to tell them about the experience, they will send another $5 to the address you redeemed the PIN (or another one if you choose). Since they charge the Bitstamp rate with NO MARKUP for the first $1,000 you will pay $50 but receive $55 worth of BTC. $5 is 10% of $50. That's a 10% bonus on top of the no markup above Bitstamp.
You must be the first customer at a location and buy $50 worth and ask for the $5 bonus. When you follow the steps, that's Bitstamp + an extra 10% free. You can only do it once per location and the math only works if you buy $50 worth.

It actually highlights the primary solution to a major problem. Sidechains assist with the max transaction rate problem. Also, all those tips are free as are withdrawals to on chain wallets (for now). They actually serve a purpose and give a concrete example for other businesses and industries to refer to and follow.

Fine. Off chain transactions.

The Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) on Samsung Galaxy S6 and up and Note 5 and up. Provides a secure, isolated operating environment. Ledger ported the code that runs their HW.1 and original Nano to run in there. Mycelium and Green Address interoperate with the Ledger TEE code exactly the same way as they do when you attach a Ledger hardware wallet via an OTG adapter.
