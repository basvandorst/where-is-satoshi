Hey so I deposited about .19995 BTC into OKex on January 8th and for some reason they 'froze' 0.15 of it??? Dafuk. I checked through their entire dogshit system to make sure I didn't black out and make a buy order with telling myself... nope. I then bought some shit coin with the 0.05 BTC they let me keep, did something else and forget about the 0.15 until today I decided to buy some other chinese "whitepaper only" "never to be coded" platform coin, and I noticed I still had this frozen 0.15. I then decided to email them, and a few hours later POOF! It disappeared! what the actual fuck? When I check the deposit history for my BTC it doesn't even show the BTC I deposited! I then went to check out blockchain.info to see wtf had happened from the offset, and correct me if I'm wrong but there is some weird shit going on with their wallet distribution. I saw my transaction for 0.19995 BTC hit 'my' BTC wallet their scamsite generated, and then it got pooled into some other wallet of theirs, wherein it got divided or something weird, but I couldn't track it anymore. This wallet is also holding 1,588.65083771 BTC after receiving 160,487.32706104 BTC
No. Transactions	8239
I checked it again just now, some 10 hours later and their quota reads:
No. Transactions	8251	
Total Received	160,603.20765326 BTC	
Final Balance	1,486.45933438 BTC
Ok, so obviously this is their exchange wallet, but as such, why would my BTC that was frozen move from the generated wallet and then go into this massive BTC pool wallet and then Ninja from there? I'm 100% certain I'm not insane/blacking out/sleep trading, as I can't see the deposited BTC entering my account at all anymore. Is this the Mandela affect? Did I slip into an alternate reality that's only slightly shitter than my previous reality? Shitter by 0.15 BTC? I can see my BTC going into the original address, so wtf? I am confooosed, anyone seen this kinda shit before or can maybe explain what might be happening here?
Also, just on another note, I sent an email threatening to social media/reddit alert about them stealing my BTC and they didn't just email me back they tried to call me. But I'd left my phone upstairs on silent, so they're listening, even if they're just not giving a fuck.

No worries ChunnyW. They're such a high volume exchange, it makes no sense for them to steal... except for the fact that they have no actual income from the exchange. It's really weird. I think they depend on deposit/withdrawal fees and stealing here and there, and most likely running APIs through their exchange. Glad you got your stellar back. What's up with XLM fud lately?
