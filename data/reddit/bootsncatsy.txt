Damn that's scary. GATA seems so underpowered. Do you think bitcoins are being manipulated?
@_date: 2013-03-01 02:02:20
I deposited like $5 and clicked the bet more. I forgot I had noscript on and the deposit disapeared. What happened? I had game ID 72.
@_date: 2013-03-02 11:46:15
Cool. Looking forward to its delivery!
@_date: 2013-03-12 01:38:16
What does that mean for 0.8 transactions? Do they get wiped out or something?
@_date: 2013-02-18 23:45:46
What illegal download sites are they talking about?
@_date: 2013-03-10 23:01:12
The site for terracoin is  How about namecoin? I haven't really looked into it, but I thought it had some value by providing a DNS?
@_date: 2013-02-21 21:41:05
What you say is true for sure. It's still the banking side with all the rules and regulations that would delay bitcoins. There probably is a hassle-free way to send money in the US but I don't know it yet. I just imagined how nice it would be if it were all easy as sending btc.
@_date: 2013-03-07 02:20:03
Why do you think it'll plummet to lower 20's after a rebound?
@_date: 2013-03-06 21:36:53
Where did you hear that?
@_date: 2013-02-14 21:17:51
Please post an update. 
@_date: 2013-02-19 22:18:30
Sounds good to me. I don't really kick myself for not buying more, but if it hit $1m/btc, I'll cry for a week straight.
@_date: 2013-03-02 11:33:29
Is the discount automatic?
Unfortunately many things were too expensive for me (though I want a lot of stuff on the kitchen section) or could be found locally (I didn't compare prices for the foodstuffs-could be worth it). I did buy the light saber chopsticks. I've been eying that for a while and it's the cheapest I've seen. Win-win. I'll post an update when it comes in.
Link to it if anyone's interested:

Yeah we initially tried that because transfer was instant but we found out it was only dwolla to dwolla accounts. The bank to dwolla and dwolla to bank transfers took a bit longer than what we needed. I guess I'm supposed to have a bankroll at dwolla, but I'm not really comfortable with that.
@_date: 2013-02-19 02:34:16
And it hit.
@_date: 2013-03-15 10:16:57
It is real value, but if no one is using them, those businesses will start to close. We are probably going to see Bitcoinstore lose the deal they have and reddit was losing money by having bitcoin as a payment option because no one is really using it to buy reddit gold. It just seems like there isn't enough spending to support these new bitcoin specific businesses.

Here is a post of starwars chopsticks I bought from JapanBit a while back:
I ended up buying some more things afterwards that haven't come in yet.
@_date: 2013-03-07 22:27:23
This is an interesting experiment. I would have liked if you didn't give out hints to see how long it really took. Either way, keep us updated.
@_date: 2013-03-03 19:45:16
I'm sorry! I just realized that I came off as confrontational when I wrote 


I meant that I was broke otherwise I would have bought more things! I did not mean to imply that you were overcharging! And I really like the kitchen section items because they were stuff I've never seen before. So, hopefully I get to buy more in the near future. Again I'm sorry.
@_date: 2013-03-16 04:29:00
Bitcoin economy at work!
@_date: 2013-03-07 00:48:53
Damn I wish money transferred faster.
@_date: 2013-02-19 08:05:09
While your heart is in the right place, I feel this is futile. There are many more things that are worse off. Nice point of discussion though. I didn't even think of that.
@_date: 2013-02-21 21:31:46


That's exactly how I felt. I had no idea what charges might pop up. Stupid amounts for fees for sending some bits over the internet.
@_date: 2013-03-14 15:22:12
I'm glad they included disposable income, but I think they should have included household income, too.
@_date: 2013-02-19 02:19:22
How do you know it was not pulled?
@_date: 2013-03-02 01:55:49
@_date: 2013-02-17 07:33:49
Search for free bitcoins. I haven't tried it but you get them for free, it'll be a very small amount.
@_date: 2013-01-23 02:14:44
What is the cause? How do you know? I bought some bitcoins a while back for around $5. Now they're 17 and I came here to find out why. I really wish I had bought much more.
@_date: 2013-03-02 01:52:42
 is why I'm more confident in bitcoins now. You see a lot more places accepting bitcoins (and gambling- I can't wait for someone to launch poker, not video poker, but Pokerstars style). A year or two ago, it was only the silk road and the infamous buying pizza for 10k btc. I've gifted reddit gold using bitcoins and I like it way better than using paypal. And reddit (or any other store) didn't have to pay the 3.x% of processing fees. Everyone wins in that transaction except paypal or credit card company.

What happened to the huge ask walls?
@_date: 2013-03-22 21:06:43
Easier to see here: 
@_date: 2013-02-21 11:58:02
Yeah, I know where you're coming from. I definitely won't mind if that good fortune came our way.
@_date: 2013-02-23 02:46:49
I didn't know it got bought through. I guess the owners of the higher priced walls changed their mind.
@_date: 2013-03-07 00:06:34
Would one miner find it all at once?
@_date: 2013-03-06 21:49:12
I don't know I kinda have a feeling it's going to be like torrent sites where more exchanges will pop up in the place of the big main one taken down. 
@_date: 2013-02-21 21:29:30
I googled transfers for BofA and they seem to charge fees. I couldn't find anything on their official site, just other forums. I don't like that I'm never sure what charges may show up. There most likely is a way to send for free that I have to look into. For bitcoins, I meant that if it was widely adopted, it would have been very easy. I just send btc, he receives and spends. I hope it gets to that one day!
@_date: 2013-02-21 21:34:31
I wish I knew about that. I'm in the US and this is the first time I've heard of that. I will definitely look into it. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-03-07 01:04:25
Hahah yeah, and all the scared people are jumping ship right this moment.
@_date: 2013-02-19 02:21:48
Almost broke $28.
@_date: 2013-01-28 03:21:14
What is the likely hood of it happening?
@_date: 2013-03-06 23:10:51
Just another "Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme" guy.
@_date: 2013-02-21 11:54:30
It was a joke in a joke thread. Even $100/btc is a quite a ways off in my opinion. I can dream of $1m/btc!
@_date: 2013-03-16 08:15:07
Wow that's nice to hear. I'm glad you posted as I didn't want it to seem like I was spamming r/bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-03-02 11:35:22
Just bought the star wars chopsticks! 
Too bad physical items can't be moved as fast as bitcoins...
edit:I would like to try out suppai-chew pointed out by noosterdam! Didnt' even know those existed.
