We discussed this one to one via direction conversation. You check your logs im sure they will still be there. I understand that these things can happen but the way you handled it was just unprofessional. If you done this I would be appreciative as its the principal of the issue. I PM you later and we can have a chat about it.
@_date: 2016-04-23 09:42:32
No its not an issue. if it became such an issue then payouts would just be bundled together on the pools discretion. I would be surprised if this is not done already its common sense.
@_date: 2016-04-27 01:07:09
You can check 21.co for their implementation of payment channels.. its  a stop gap I believe until a bunch of other soft forks are integrated by miners into the network.
@_date: 2016-04-19 17:28:57
Either way works. If you have a regular income and buying as you go, it is much less likely to cause a disparity on your overall expected wealth. By using something like  you can have the convenience of regular fiat but with the potential of bitcoins.

@_date: 2016-04-21 10:54:35
In a word, no.
Pretty much everything you read about alternatives either have the same scaling issues that they have not hit yet or features which can eventually be built as an integration with bitcoin. Its a typical example of putting the cart before the horse.
If people really think forward we could issue national currencies on the bitcoin blockchain and use them with zero friction on the lightning network.. then you have a REAL competitor to visa/mastercard etc.

Bitcoin does not depend on transactions. Blocks are still processed with or without transactions. Block rewards still go down, even if there there are no reasons for a block to fundamentally be processed, it probably will.

Well the block reward is split from the transactions, it is a long term goal of a way to bootstrap and distribute the wealth and security of the network in exactly that, an arbitrary way.

Its a consensus rule. If it was to change it would create a hard fork and *everyone* has to change to avoid creating two coins. A larger block size is not the answer though to fix capacity without damaging the main features of bitcoin.

actually this was suggested to our group not so long ago.. I think there is a little merit in the idea. its a direct copy paste not to basterdize it at all..
The problem with demmorage coins is noone wants to hold them so noone buys them so everyone gets rid of them. So why not airdrop coins with a hardfork from every bitcoin block? Its a true bitcoin dividend and people could have a transactional crypto without having to spend their bitcoin. The benefits could be to create an Oracle: a blockchain of price history, create a stable crypto-fiat, and a crosschain atomic swap platform. It use the onchain data from atomic swaps between btc and this coin to facillitate decentralised exchange/
Lol. If i had my way I'd call it 'Cash' just to fuck over Ver and Jihan. 
:"Whats that, bitcoin - cash?"
:"it looks a lot cheaper than that BCH"
:"Think I'll sell some BCH for that"
The inflation mechanism is easier because all the inputs are digital. For the period of each block you could moniter price feeds from exchanges, option markets, local bitcoins ect. And use an algo to produce an averge btc price for the duration of the block, say btc/usd pair. As a fork of btc the token would be segwit enabled so ideally an algo could moniter both blockchains for atomic swaps and use this to peg the 'cash' token to a dollar, by increacing new issuance of 'cash' upon btc apreciation, and contracting the supply of usd tokens through demurrage upon btc depreciation. I was thinking about the best method of demurrage; a decay of oldest coins, decay of total stock of coins or burn of tokens as a percentage of transaction fees a bit like eth gas. Im not sure if mining would be required as its more like proof of stake. I like the thought of getting dividends to buy more bitcoin! ����
I'm sure all of this could be built into a wallet that does atomic swaps and pays you dividends. No third parties  needed and no worries about a tether token backing being fractional or siezed, cos the crypto usd is collateralised with bitcoin.

What? That same argument applies to ever single way you can use bitcoin. In fact applies to almost everything about computing.

People have real actual physical wallets that contain nothing more expensive than a drivers license and cash. Wallets which cost at most 10% of the value of what they are holding.

Investing in individual companies is a lot of risk. These are a *lot* of competing startups in the same field. You really need to pick you battles or have enough cash to cover all eventualities. Investing in startups is very akin to gambling. Especially when they are building on something which is also still being built. The actual definition of a house of cards.
Im not saying its not profitable though if you get it right. Its just... unlikely.
If you want to start, maybe you can register on somewhere like angel.co or secondmarket.com

It is actually trivial to setup a private VPN network to route traffic out of the country under the guise of something else. It only stops the general publics access. Anyone with average knowledge of tech can get around the nations firewall.

This can be automated fairly easily. Simply generating the remaining combinations with a script and bitcore lib to check wallet validity to create a prepopulated list then fire out the first address in the sequence to an API to check if it has a historical balance in the blockchain. This could even be done locally to your own node. Found a historical balance? Generate keys until they are no longer recognized.

I think (as expected) any insurer can calculate the odds of being "done over" with a suitable equation. It is not any different from bitcoin. As time improves the architecture, platforms and the reliability of the transactions we will see the cost of insurance decrease.
What I do like is their mitigation techniques what parallels my generall feeling of how bitcoin services can improvise.

I guess what you could do is a sign a message from one address that the following address you are sending coins to. This way the original address has been used but a statement of intent has been provided. Not perfect but not bad.

I actually quite like this proposal. Be nice if you wrote up a white paper for it.
@_date: 2018-08-13 21:35:42
It would reorganise automatically to the longest, valid, proof of work chain which each node will see and relay. There may be some disruption but broadcasting blocks at this stage is very reliable and for this to happen would see catastrophic failure and overall very unlikely. If did we would have much bigger issues.

Yes and no. It would reverse a bunch of transactions if they were not seen on the other chain but if we were aware that such a split was happening and raw tx could be stored by the possibly effected party and rebroadcast and integrated into the final chain. You still can't falsify moving funds if the keys are not present.

Multisg 2 of 2 with your account at London Underground. Internal network hosts a full node. NFC enabled device on the payment app. All that together would be very close to those speeds. If you want to remove the funds from the card, just send to a different wallet. Simple. also allows people to self fund.

The fundamentals is that something is valuable because someone else wants it. It does not matter at all in the slightest that it has utility. You can take any object, for any purpose, if someone is willing to give you some sort of currency for it, it has value. If nobody wants it, it has no value.

yeh basically automatically create bitcoin tokens which can be used within a system, or multiple exchanges which are backed, cryptographically by a real time auditing server and when it goes outwith one of these systems, it uses the blockchain to do the transfer. This is how micro transactions will pan out in the future. all backed by bitcoin, but not using the blockchain.

A protocol shouldn't change though. Improvements yes but not in this case. If enough services were using OT it would be fundamentally impossible to tell which have been blinded / tokenized / moved and out of the system.

That depends where your located and their connectivity to the actual forex market..
I will take my example as the Croatian Kuna, if I went and spent say 500HRK which is 88.50USD at spot rates and they can get that rate from BTC to HRK on however they balance their accounts it would be cheaper than doing a triple jump from BTC to USD to HRK.
It really depends on how the books are balanced. More information is needed, which I doubt they would provide but we can probably reverse presume when we see their rates.

My affiliation to Bitcoin is the following... should have multiple options. I invest and I purchase things.
Which of the following people has its own Bitcoin fund? Richard Branson owns coins... and the Winklevoss have not actually released their fund yet.. So its an odd question.
Over the past twelve months, the market price of one Bitcoin was... within the range of other commodities from YTD  Volatility is relative.
I do not think banks will ever support Bitcoin. This is worded badly. Multiple questions are worded with the negative and some with the positive. It makes it difficult for the person taking the survey. Requires a double take on which way to respond.
As others have said the regulation question seems out of date also. Also what defines regulation? many countries have regulated bitcoin but declared it a safe heaven like Isle of Man..
I think Bitcoin will be worthless one day. very open ended. Everything will be worthless one day. We talking 5 years ? 50 years? 500 years?

1. Explain the difference with a distributed ledger (secret book only your bank can see vs public book but nobody knows who owns what.
2. Explain about keeping keys safe, paper wallet may not be the best. Mention how as it is digital you can replicate it but only spend it once.
3. Explain how volatility (albeit not to this degree) happens in all markets but people are usually abstracted from it as they only use their own money.
Anything else that is usually mentioned is good also. I have found, personally, bringing these topics up in this way helps those I have explained it to along with the more regular definitions and methods.

Switching between fiat systems is one thing, switching to an entire new way money is even created and integrated into society is another thing altogether. What if bitcoin had a flaw? the entire economy would halt. Not as in "oh our systems are down" but as in "oh we have to implement an entire new system ASAP so we can contnue on the EU / world stage"
Anyone suggesting BTC as a currency for Scotland is beyond daft and should be dismissed. Im all for a new currency but BTC should not be it, yet. Maybe as a secondary officially supported currency but not by itself.

I understand this, my point is most services are not attempting to use a multitude of ways to collate an aggregated list of plausible changes an individual is making to split people apart. installing a new font or changing your resolution etc may make that service think you are someone else.

It does not matter if we want to live outside the system. We are attempting to do our best by using BTC. When something goes wrong we do not have a replacement to the system. We cannot simply go and execute those who have wronged us because the current system will punish those who take action into our own hands. Replacing the current legal system IS coming. Its about working with what you have though.

We use digital surety bonds to protect the interests of the clients. I could issue for instance 100kg of digital gold. Pay 10,000BTC to the contract itself which would guarantee my perforamce or reliability. 
We could use a pool of trusted sources to have an M of N amount required to be able to redistribute X% per voting round if I was to fall on a single large order for instance, or if I was to disappear completely.
"proof of reserves" takes on a whole new meaning and this is what I meant, these companies issuing such information is only a half step as to where this is going.

Fraud team is usually open 24/7 with UK banks. There is reason though. When people wire money out of their account for the first time to buy a non reversible digital currency, if it not the real owner it is the *bank* who is liable, not you. At the end of the day they are protecting themselves.

Ok by all you literally mean **all**. I disagree though as if one person held all the bitcoins *someone*, including myself, would purchase them for novelty factor alone giving them whatever value collectors would put on it. Lots of things have value that have no utility, plush toys have no utility but have value.
I understand the merits of bitcoin. It requires all actors to take a part in the system and a very large part in that is actually holding on to coins. What do you think would happen if everyone sold all their coins as soon as they got them?

Basically the 12 words works exactly as you describe, as a seed value. From that point on the seed can determine (in a mathematical way) the next private key generated is related to the previous and as it is a standard way to generate addresses we can safely assume it will work out exactly the same sequence. So address number 1583 will always be exactly the same. Yes crypo is magical.

tokenisation of bitcoin in predefined escrow contracts will fix 4. switching between a real bitcoin and a token will be seamless and secure in the future. It is being worked on. 
@_date: 2014-07-03 15:27:00
Ok, bitcoin as a sole currency would have to be tokenised by a central authority for trust in use for OTC transactions, as the blockchain could not handle the volume of transactions. Every large corporate would have to adjust their hardware to work with the blockchain or tokenisation system (tesco or w/e). Massive education of how this. Currency would be used would need to take place. How would pricing work? Would it be pegged against the USD and floating prices? Too much volatility for day to day for an entire nation when pricing is affected by a global market, there would no border insulation. This is just of the top of my head..
@_date: 2014-07-25 16:38:01

Check which transaction went to SatoshiDice. Provide me that address, what you want to sign and the resulting signature.  It can be tricky if you make a lot of transactions but you should know what is what considering you know you won and there has been x number of confirmations.

@_date: 2014-06-09 23:10:56
actually it depends what data they use to fingerprint you. If the specific service uses IP as part of the identify information, switching to a different server would identify you as someone else. It really is service dependant.

You need to sign that message with one of these two addresses.
When you sign something it must be exact or it will fail. Even the capitalisation I had would break it. Once you get used it it makes it very easy but you need to provide us with exactly what has been signed so we can verify it without the trouble.

Settlement layer is *exactly* what it is. In its current form, as with all blockchain based systems, we will have issues when scaling. People here screaming for the hills thinking some other altchain is going to save the day are delusional. There are techniques how we can have high speed trustless transactions that can scale but on-chain is *not* the answer.

Ok, I'm going to play devils advocate and ask if anyone can explain why multisig makes a difference. I'll explain.
When a hacker gains access to a server to try and relieve them of their funds, what is to stop them mimicking the server running a withdrawal the same way the server does? I'm assuming it sends a request for the 2nd signature as an automated process. How are they to know if it is a legitimate or fraudulent request? Multisig seems to miss the vital point of audit ability of funds moving about, or am I missing something?

Need more information. Which country are you moving to and from? A wire fee is usually at most 50USD. If there is no currency exchange there is no fee on the spread (where banks usually sap all a lot of the money, especially with higher amounts).
Probably need more information to make an accurate statement.

You are clearly not who you say you are so I will bite. I believe this is a self audit so...
Wireless keyboard is definitely the weak point. A script could essentially inject a stealth command to write a transaction, hide it in memory and replace it with the one he intends to write before it goes back on the USB. Only once broadcast it would be realised it was not his intended transaction.

A digital notary using triple signed cryptographic receipts are also immutable by any party in the trade so your single point - is wrong.
You can call it what you like. I'm glad you know the fault in your point. You are basically just full assumptions and new accounts aren't you?
@_date: 2015-01-12 17:44:16
At no point I would say it is a good idea. It is plausible but honestly there are much better ways to consider. OpenBazaar being the obvious choice. the implications of financing an organized criminal is probably the biggest concern and it would be a long drawn out argument between two lawyers to define the outcome. Probably something you would not want to be involved in over a few pieces of art.

Wire generally uses the SWIFT network. bank transfers is a term for internal to the country (Faster Payments / ACH (?). One crosses borders, one doesnt. Generally speaking anyway, SEPA is the exception rather than the rule.
Not to put words in mouths here but from my experience  LBTC is generally local transfers. As a trader it will deeply impact your stats if you have to wait 5~ days for a wire transfer. 
@_date: 2016-01-14 10:03:30


No. RIPEMD-160(SHA-256(public key)) is how we create an address pair. The mathematical limit to this is incredibly high.


See above. Also a address is only known to the network once a transaction is sent to it.


a bitcoin is a note of account on the ledger, an address is where the note is placed, a wallet is what you use to store all your addresses.


This is essentially what SPV wallets are doing. You broadcast to a full node to which then relays the transaction to the other nodes.
...sorry about the order.

Transactions are very very cheap. The entire blockchain so far could be doubled in size for about 5m USD. Chump change for an attacker.
Jeff mentioned the idea of having a aggressive fee structure above the normal blockcap which would help with this greatly. so exponential cost above the standard to create the increase to greatly reduce the ability for such an attack.

Well this is what the funny thing is, the 1MB seems to be a sweet spot for now for limiting damage that can be done from creating transactions that are hard to verify. SegWit does solve this problem which makes scaling the blocksize directly in the future *much* safer. Although we can hope that other technological advance can save us from ever having to do that, which would be amazing.

Just for some clarity about the machine..
The coffee is automatically dispersed on a transaction being received by the machine. During the process you are asked about your next coffee choice to fill the machine with (best ethics, best flavor, best or the eco system etc)
The machine also does a reward program for maintaining it so if the the water is empty of the beans are out, it pays the users bitcoin or offers a free coffee to fix the problem.

Not so much assumptions but their available bandwidth on running a node, seeding blocks, relaying transactions, being a useful participant generally. I think 4MB would be a limit for now. Doesn't really matter because hardforking to get there isnt worth it.

@_date: 2016-06-30 20:52:44
OK il explain a little more, as I have the opportunity. It is one of the fundamental reasons I am not *too* worried about centralisation of mining in the long term. As we advance in technology and better ways of storing, moving and trading electricity we will actually be in a surplus. We can already see this in the media with consumers even being paid to use the energy (Chile) once people catch on that all excess energy can be used to mine coins this will cause a natural leveling out of the industry away from large datacentre type institutes.
@_date: 2017-01-30 20:59:13
f2pool could go gangster. signal for segwit on litecoin, push it across the threshold. Dump litecon as price rises, buy bitcoin as people freak out. Once you make a tidy profit, buy up the cheap bitcoin with your litecoin then signal for bitcoin to have segwit while mining blocks for litecoin which no longer have segwit by pusing that 45% over to 51%. Boom - there is your dinner.
@_date: 2016-06-29 10:03:37
I slightly disagree here already, technically Bitcoin is outside of the law as it is worldwide and laws are country by country. Some places may not ever require KYC/AML for bitcoin yet they will be tarnished in the same way by this BIP.

We had two bags of grass, seventy-five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high-powered blotter acid, a saltshaker half-full of cocaine, and a whole multi colored collection of uppers, downers, laughers, screamers... Also, a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of beer, a pint of raw ether, and two dozen amyls. Not that we needed all that for the trip, but once you get into a serious drug collection, the tendency is to push it as far as you can. The only thing that really worried me was the ether.

Make a replica of reddit whereby you need to sign a username with a lightning channel address. The more value held by this address makes it cheaper to vote. Those with small balances can still make a vote but it costs a little more. We can mitigate vote brigading this way and its not possible to falsify accounts and those with more value gain a small increase in the say on what is being upvoted and down voted.
Go easy on me the idea is a work in progress but I think there is something here that can be done.
@_date: 2018-10-15 14:10:02
Coins only exist on the sidechain once bitcoin is locked away on the main chain. To falsify that the entire federation would have to cheat. I agree it is more centralised but once you give your coins to an exchange you are already under their rigmarole of attestation so its really six and two threes. If you dont like it, dont use it.

What you can do is provide a salt for each user, they then concatenate that with their bid and hash it. Write that as a transaction so you would have something like this
SHA256(Tony-ae31515ea-BID-500GBP) = d4b087e4620a143a3b23f91e55fefe490d34f636539bf2402c195e93033ec7e9
This original input then can be revealed to prove the bid was specific amount and placed onto the chain earlier in time... 
This is napkin stuff but its definitely possible, probably a better way to do it but you get the idea.

Its a bad way of working generally. They should be using a system with a float that they can buy/sell on the exchange in and relay coins to there when low.

Cost of creation. Actually this is a very good solution to Sybil attack issues. When we know a channel must be created in order to validate a user (which is fairly static) that identity had a non-zero cost of creation. If you want to run 1000 identities and create bots for nefarious reasons this soon becomes unfeasible especially if they get banned, the general premise of this is a pay-to-play system where we no longer question the logic of bots but go along with it, as long as they pay the price.

A real identity can last a user for years, a bot may only last a few days to run its purpose or get banned for behaviors like astroturfing. Using a long term identity for a legitimate user may be viable as a one of payment for 5usd... 10usd.. depending on cost of block space at the time. Bots will (likey) soon be unviable to use in such a manner.

Nonsense. As the value of bitcoin grew we seen a greater expenditure  of bitcoin (based on USD). A better analogy is to compare it to the tech market. We know a computer will half in value in 18 months and has done since the past 30+ years. That does not stop anyone from going out and buying one. 
A functional market is a mixture of both aspects. We need it to be used as a speculative asset for holding AND as a currency secondly. After all who wants a type of money which nobody wants to hold? Why would anyone accept it?

you can create a UASF on many things you want. If people who actually use bitcoin don't agree with your rules and don't run your software you will be barred from their network. Your UASF will fork into its own chain (if there is even miner support for it). Creating 5000 nodes that do nothing but shout your rules wont help. Sybil attacking with no miner support or economic value is pointless.

This may help you map out a plan. The escrow partner does not need to interfere unless there is a complaint by either party.

When I have had dealing with businesses in similar situation I would use a a structured payment method whereby the initial funds were released on good faith to cover initial costs and more would be released on completion then delivery.. Can you not structure multiple escrow payments in such a way? If these people are your regular suppliers you should have *some* level of trust even if its only a small amount of the overall total.. If you dont maybe its worth a trip to China and visit them in person - most  decent Chinese businesses will oblige and be happy to have you round.

Well it depends. You can fork it and make changes, additions etc with very little effort.
Part of the proposal could be economic experiments in what you plan to change, then following up (this can limit the amount of properties which need to be changed and you can backpedal easier if need be with the timeframe) on these. Creating one from scratch is a large project though if you ain't using an established code base.

Yeah, your numbers are way off. WAY off. Quadratic scaling is a very real issue and there were blocks which had TXs in them that were created to be specifically hard to verify., creating individual txs which took minutes to verify on average hardware.
At what point does it come that transactions are being created faster than an individual can verify them. this is a non negotiable issue when it comes to requiring to update and verify the history of the chain.

A question in an abstract sense that relates to this is thought of a heap of sand. If you remove one grain from the heap at a time, when does it no longer be a heap? What makes bitcoin bitcoin? Is it the price? is it the development team? The users? The infrastructure? The POW? The ideology? Hard forking clearly starts a process of the ability to break down some of these properties and should be avoided at all cost in my opinion. I love this quote from ICANN recently which should be noted in the bitcoin sphere also;
"We would rather proceed cautiously and reasonably, than continue with the roll on the announced date of 11 October. It would be irresponsible to proceed with the roll after we have identified these new issues that could adversely affect its success and could adversely affect the ability of a significant number of end users."

Some of us have been banging on about this technology since a long time, the thing about it is, it doesn't actually require to keep track of transactions.

Out of the box item registration on the blockchain essentially giving an item a "passport". If you can identify an object, you can do business with an object.

I feel you may be over complicating this. This private key business I think is not required...
With Open Assets you would assign maybe 10,000 individual satoshis as "licence instance". These are non divisible assets that you know and your customs know what they are. The software requiring licence just has to monitor the blockchain for one of these satoshi and the owner of may need to sign a message with the key for it.  As it is transfered around on an after market none of these features would be lost...
Maybe I am missing something but seems like your making more work for yourself when the system is already in place.

It is really not that simple for a single institution. Once it is outwith their system they cant just arbitrarily change the numbers.

I have set up OT server and moneychanger client locally. Created my own assets and played around with stuff. It certainly works but getting the system from there to a working exchange would  take another layer of code and a change of mindset on how to build such an application.

I think we are thinking down different lines... if someone sends you money and it is reported as fraud.. the banks under no way in hell will call you to be like "excuse us.. we think this transactions is fraudulent.. give us some details please?!" otherwise what your saying is a a non statement.

With compact blocks and fiber this is reduced significantly... but the basic concept that due to networks inside china being significantly faster internally than externally that other miners inside china can start building on top of a new block before those outside get to see it. This sways it in  favor of those in China. The larger the blocks are the more of a problem this becomes.

I think it can. actual uses will go higher and higher up the food chain. Realistically you can use a bitcoin backed visa card to spend 20k in a single transaction. If bitcoin is a successful store of value the sort of value which will be transfered will be exceptionally large numbers compared to the majority of what we have today.

So your logic is make development more difficult ? Multiple people are already implementing LN clients. I think we are up to about 5 companies implementing the same protocol.  SW fixes issues that makes it much more simple to implement. From bitcoincore.org : 
The Lightning Network: with third-party and scriptSig malleability fixed, the Lightning Network is less complicated to implement and significantly more efficient in its use of space on the blockchain. With scriptSig malleability removed, it also becomes possible to run lightweight Lightning clients that outsource monitoring the blockchain, instead of each Lightning client needing to also be a full Bitcoin node.

I recommend you look for the larger traders on localbitcoins they might be able to help you. Talk to them directly and explain what you may need. You should be able to get the rates knocked down to 2% above spot price for that amount.

This is an interesting point as it actually depends on how the address was used that stores the coins. If an address has been reused and coins reside in that address then using quantum theory there is belief that the private key can be derived based on the public key and signature of the address used. This can happen in a polynomial time which is an issue for someone who is dead an reused an address. If you want to research more it can be is related to  An address which has never resigned to resend money does not have this issue. I am not a math guy so excuse any mistakes in this.

Nobody wants to preload the dam card. This is a very easily solvable issue im sure. I don't get why everyone is doing it this way.
Make the available balance on the card the equivalent in USD terms then when someone makes a purchase, sell of the BTC value, alter the available balance on the card. This way it can always be kept in bitcoin.

So gold? fiat based currency has not existed for that long. Around 100 years, as for currency backed by a commodity, that doesnt really exist anymore for the majority of situations.


Nothing to do with that. Big time investors who have institutional rules process to follow cant get into bitcoin due to risk management within companies. Nothing to do with retail use. 


Many are just replicas of bitcoin with a few tweeks, many of the issues they will face in the future when people actually use them will come in time. Bitcoin has the network and infrastructure already and is trying to solve the hard problems.


If I made a MaxCoin2 (one already exists) with a premine of 100m coins and sold 1 for 100usd, this is added to a list of crypto currency and valued at 10b and dilutes market share. Extreme example but you get the idea.

The fact when SW activtes it will cause a lot of USP of altcoins to pop especially when there will be multiple technologies rolled out on bitcoin. Also if tether doesn't fix itself up by then the only "escape" is literally bitcoin from the alts. Very few go back into fiat directly and even if they did,, the ones that don't will cause a bitcoin run-up and in turn other money will follow. Self for-filling prophecy.

Not sure. Maybe cause alts are mentioned? Automod rules here have to be strong due to a barrage of attacks generally. .
There is a few reasons generally. Network effect is very strong, wide knowledge and acceptance of this. The "alts" which have more to offer don't really have much more without massive drawbacks involving centralisation and scaling problems. The reason you dont see this is mainly because nobody is actually using them.
Bitcoin has the most users, infrastructure, development and attention generally. Those that are trying to "fix" things dont even see the bigger picture.

It would have zero impact. Someone holding bitcoin and claiming they are destroyed is the same thing. Off market coins are off market.

Calling it "bitcoin 2" is a bit silly. Monetas platform is the most logical possible way to include all these advanced features people think of as "bitcoin 2" esque such as smart contracts, asset issuance etc. They just instead of building another blockchain use a much more logical method of implementation. If a  service *does* need bitcoin their software can utilize its benefits.

A cashiers check is not cash its a piece of paper. In the UK every single bank has a withdrawal limit of 2.5k GBP. Anything over this without 48 hours notice is by their own discretion. An ATM limit is not included in this so if you have 500GBP daily limit on your card this can be taken out separately..

Its a service. nice way of sending small amounts to other people on certain services.
It will definitely go up, unless it goes down.
Its a wallet. That is YOUR wallet, take funds from services like ChangeTip and move them here. Only you have access to this. There many wallets to choose from but that is the main client.
Generally not unless you build a good reputation on somewhere like localbitcoins.
Yes, in one form or another.

It depends on who issues these tokens. Also it works as a store of value in GBP before tokens are sent outward.

I actually think we are referring to the same thing. A full node, that is used by any economic party is an economic node. I am just differentiating between this and someone who spins up nodes to give the impression of adoption... like what happened in altcoins and unlimited for instance. Its the difference between a say 5k real nodes and 35k thousands nodes ran by 200 people. To a clarify, all nodes are full nodes, even ones which are being Sybilled, but they are not economic.

An economic node is one that actually is being used by its owner or even a group of users, although everyone should be running their own. It is a way to separate the difference between a Sybil node (someone who spins up 50 nodes on AWS to make it appear their is support for a client but in actuality they are not being used by people).

That will not be an issue for many years to come unless transactions pick up massively. The block reward is much to large to worry about transactions fees.

You can issue a GBP token back by bitcoin... it floats value based on the GBP value based on bitcoin.. not sure why you think that is not possible? Some smaller altcoins are already doing it (market cap is too small to work in a lot of situations though).

The individual user is the *most* important thing they are protecting in this approach. I am very much a proponent of layer two solutions as they, for a long time, have been the best solution. People are brining even better solutions closer the bottom layer with techniques like the lightning network. This gives the best of both worlds. It you can get the features which the world expects like mircopayments, high throughput *and* decentralisation with this methodology it should be the route taken. On chain scaling as it stands would *never* scale to anywhere close to what is required to keep up with worldwide adoption of any sort of significant amount.
The secret is barrier to entry. I honestly believe in the next 5 years mining will actually have a lower barrier to entry than it does now due to home storage of electric. Lightning nodes can also be setup by individuals if this is what they choose to do with their coins, decentralisation of this I dont see being a problem at all. Keeping full nodes running on the network which is still feasable for an average user is very important to keep all these other things in check. Its also the one with no tangible incentive which makes all the more important to make it accessible.

It may not be *either* of their faults. The system is pretty broken generally. I cant confirm about how the US works but I have wired money before and it literally has gotten lost.

As a regular seller this is not true. In the UK no bank keeps that sort of money. I struggle to withdraw anything above 3kGBP in cash.
but overall all this is just b/s. just get the bank to check notes are real and send bitcoin. 
If your a seller get the payee to text you the address the coins are going to, this gives proof that they requested the payment to this address if they try a fast one. even 99% of scammers are not stupid enough to rob someone in a bank.
Overall stop freaking out so much and trade. ive sold to over 400 people and never once had an issue of scammers or people out to rob me, most people just want BTC.

This may be true but its very short perception to say this will always be the case, also retail sales below three figures really cant justify the tx fees needed for writing all this data into a blockchain.

This exponential growth is quite something. It may be rising too quickly but the likelihood of it dropping significantly is low in my opinion. even of a drop of 4-5USD would recover in not so long. Id rather risk holding than selling for sake of volatility.

I for one would happily use my bitcoin on ebay. Im pretty sure its acceptable, someone else has listed a post here mentioning how to accept bitcoin by default on your lisitings.
Please note that is the US policy they are discussing so its worth switching to the .co.uk one to confirm.

In what time frame? Have you ever seen the governance of any sizeable organisation that would have the funds to do this? Christ, these things don't happen over night and to get people *actually* doing stuff down the chain takes time. 
Even these small operations have taken a significant time to get on their feet and products are only going out now, for this to happen it would take incredible efficiency, I am not saying it couldn't its just unlikely.
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:57:44
Im optimistic.. I just wired more money to the exchange to buy more haha. I still hold coins and didnt sell. Im more keen than ever to see what new is going to pop up.
What people seem to forget is all these people who cashed out.. now have significant sums of fiat that can be used to put back into development and new creative projects. *cough* high speed exchange *cough*

Saving bitcoins is not a problem, if you need something and can use bitcoin though, do so :) you can always buy more.
@_date: 2013-07-28 17:09:10
Glad im not the only one. In all seriousness though, Its under a 4% swing. Yes its a lot but its not the same as 4USD price change when it was at 15USD. Massive difference. 
When a swing is considered under a 1% change in value then thats "stable enough", for me anyway. Obviously we will need the price to be around the 400USD mark for 4USD price swing to be at that percentage.
@_date: 2013-08-19 15:41:09

@_date: 2013-02-25 16:14:15
What country are you in? Makes a difference. If your UK based I recommend localbitcoins, most top sellers accept bank deposit and 1BTC is not an issue.
I used to sell to plenty people only wanting 1BTC and value was half of it is now.
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:19:32
50USD to 10USD?
Think about how much the price would have to change for this to happen on mBTC level. Now times that by 10 fold if the market grows. That sort of swing is really ridiculous. People need to look at log scales and work out how they relate as linear mathematics in trading is retarded.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:42:02
Sell lol... naw people panicking all over the shop.. I have wired more money to the exchange to buy though...

@_date: 2013-08-12 18:25:42
This is a hard one in the Bitcoin investment world. Its like a real world investment. We will need to wait years to see a return.
How long do you intend to offer the 20% IPO for? is it there until it sells? Will the next batches be the same rate as the original of 0.15BTC?
This may look much more appealing when you have a front facing functional site and the registration process has all been completed, basically everything than can go wrong has not.
