I've thought about people shorting futures as the cause of the price move - I actually thought the price would move back to $18k as that's what so many futures were priced at in December. I'm curious why all the big alt coins dropped so much as well. I understand Bitcoin often drives ups and downs with other cryptocurrencies, but, for example, Ether went up a lot recently independently of BTC, BCH, Litecoin. I think the China and Korea FUD really freaked people out.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:05:05
I thought it was actually a good sign that the dip was only about 10 minutes.
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:44:13
But, if you are a vet you would have seen the correction coming after $19.8k, when it went to $19k then dipped hard. Could have sold and bought at a lower price.

Usually the seed is only good for the wallet type that created it. The wallet usually creates them. It's safer. Sometimes the user can add a passphrase in addition to the created seed phrase. You can write the seed down and put it somewhere like a safe deposit box, or if you want to be more hardcore you can use something like Cryptosteel to record your seed.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:12:47
I agree - not necessarily evil, but they are a company in a capitalist society with the power to do basically whatever they want in the crypto space. They chose to make money supporting BCH instead of making things easier/smoother for BTC users. Also, BTC's scalability problems are really a big hindrance at this point.  
  
Kraken is, unfortunately, pretty unusable.

No spikes. Pretty consistent. I don't think anybody knew what was going to happen.
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:53:31
No. 
1) the miners 'take' the fees - not Coinbase. Coinbase might take a little of the 'network fee', shown to you, for themselves before sending to miners. 
2) they don't use the highest fee. Do you see any $500 fees? $1000? $1m?

An exchange hooks up buyers and sellers. Depending on what buyers are asking and what sellers are willing to pay (orders), the price will vary. Some, maybe most, use algorithms based on available orders to put their own pricing on top to make money. Like Coinbase might show $11k on their main chart, but when you click Buy, the price they sell to you is $11,100.

I dont think you can specify the fee on Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:27:56
I think best time is 1) immediately when possible, or 2) wait a few months. When BCH first was given out in Aug, it was a race to sell and the price kept dropping as the transaction rate was so low people couldn't get in to dump quick enough. It took me 18 hours to get my BCH into Bittrex. B then, the value had dropped 50%. Obviously, the price has rebounded since August, so if you can't sell within a few hours of available trading, you can be in good position if you wait a few months.

@_date: 2017-12-15 00:59:55
The CBOE futures didn't cause a dip. Futures were trading at a 13% premium. People who shorted lost money
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:07:58
1) I don't believe this is possible. A transaction must be verified by all available nodes. Then it is allowed to enter the mempool. This is part of the decentralized design.
2) Even if this was possible, Jihan's ability to mine would be so much weaker than the current total BTC mining pool that these 'private' transactions would probably never make it to a new block.
And, I would not say it's necessarily a *minor* advantage. ASICBoost allows up to 20-30% more hashing 'power'.
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:13:09
Their loudest proponent is an ex-con who is trying to use the name Bitcoin on Bitcoin.com to refer to BCash in an effort to confuse newbs into buying BCash instead of Bitcoin, they have spammed the Bitcoin network in attempts to congest it, the main miner moved to BCash from Bitcoin because SegWit takes away their mining advantage - which is a technology that is patent pending in the US but they use without paying royalties in China, they don't really have a dev team, their bigger block size leads to centralization as it's more expensive to run a node.

If Jihan wanted to mine BTC and Segwit is enabled in Coinbase, he/they cannot use ASICBoost and have no advantage for those transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:21:17
Wow, you say something incorrect, ask for enlightenment, get a valid explanation then can't accept you are incorrect. You're not 100% going to get a transaction in the next block. There are many scenarios where this would not happen. 100% is 100% - no exceptions. Good luck trying to grasp concepts
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:28:45
False - Coinbase could set the fee to whatever they want. Any wallet creating a transaction can specify their own fee value. The transaction might just take longer to go through. Coinbase just doesn't allow its users to specify the fee.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:08:21

They can't. They're just trying to make money. BCH is controlled by a few shady characters. It's not decentralized.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:02:30
That's steep but depends on how quickly you want the transaction to go through. Low fees aren't really being processed very quickly now.

There probably is a dip coming. BTC network is clogged with low fee transactions. Once the futures start, it's going to get even more clogged. Panic sells ensue.

1) miners can pick whatever transactions they want to include  
2) quite often an empty block is the next block mined. Your tx, no matter how high its fee, will not be in an empty block
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:47:32
The funds would have never left. You can use replaceable fees in certain wallets. You can update the fee after you have submitted.

Your wallet can give you a notification e.g. Electrum. You can create a payment request as well (Bitcoin receive request). A hardware wallet like Ledger allows you to email the request. It will update in near real-time upon receipt of BTC. You should wait for about 3+ confirmations though technically 1 confirmation is probably good enough *right now* (based on current mining distribution). 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:20:52
Bittrex doesn't require an ID, afik. They don't work with fiat i.e. banks. It will take some time to transfer in and definitely transfer BTC out. The BTC network is clogged up, and Bittrex requires a lot of confirmations for deposits.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:12:20
What exchange? You can transfer out of Coinbase through GDAX for 'free' - you have to provide 2 forms of ID to register on GDAX. I don't think anybody can predict if the fee will go down. It's high because of so much congestion on the network. That fluctuates.

Hmm, well we'll have to disagree on whether or not there is 'the mempool.' As far as not relaying transactions, I do think the validation latency issues could be detrimental to mining rewards, but it's hard to say. As far as 20% hash power, etc - yes that would be the same, but what I'm saying is Coinbase will probably have a higher transaction rate than the 20% hash power is able to provide. Therefore, transactions would build up faster than they can be processed. I think at the current 20% rate, ~90k transactions can be processed / day. Coinbase surpassed this years ago (how many are on-chain nowadays, I'm not sure).

No but you claimed "It is provably impossible to design a system which is immune from an attacker with unlimited funds. It cannot be done." You are apparently confused. Strong cryptography is an example that shows you are not right. A large military isn't going to be much help if you don't have unlimited time. Also listing one hypothetical situation that you think meets your hypothesis is not a formal proof. That is not how logic works.

I don't see BCH staying if they can't increase their mining abilities drastically or mess more with the difficulty algorithm.
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:27:00
Bitfinex - a very heavy exchange - is probably involved in pumping the BTC value using money they basically printed. Now, if they disappear - what is the effect on the value of BTC?

Nothing I wrote is specific to America. Thanks for the snide attempt at usefulness.
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:12:00
Sorry you guys didn't learn from BCH. The value of BCH tanked as people frantically tried to sell, BUT if you held for just a little longer, BCH rose back up in value after the initial surge of desperate sellers. Also, for B2X, if you sell immediately, those coins may also be spent on the BTC chain since there is no replay protection.

Definitely some strange campaign going on. This guy's only been here 3 weeks and is writing uneducated nonsense.
@_date: 2017-11-07 04:12:53
also, BTC is severely limited in Tx rate. Sidechains will arguably lead to much more centralization. "BTC not fast enough? Use our network" Basically back to big banks.

Don't use Kraken. Their engine/site is just so slow. Even slower than Coinbase. I used to use Kraken all the time. Simple limit orders may not go through in a timely fashion.

Amazingly accurate assessment of this subreddit, except missing “attack” conspiracy theories
@_date: 2017-11-07 03:41:31
This 'attack' stuff is getting old. 1x is not all of a sudden disappearing. If some exchange wants to call 2x "BTC" that's their choice. Miners want to mine another blockchain...that's their choice.

"Traditional sense" - it's an economics definition. I see you're trying to look up the definition but don't understand it. Your apples example is missing a lot of context but if that's it then YES it's a free market.

Pretty amazing how much time Roger Ver will waste on something like this. Just makes look bad.

Oh look another new Redditor talking about dumping. If all you guys dump, great - cheaper B2X AND BTC (replay) for others to pick up, haha
@_date: 2017-11-03 13:59:59
Shaking my head...buying to dump is super risky. The value could drop before they're able to dump, or the price would just continue to rise and they would have just wasted opportunity cost. Also, there's no direct link to say 'Doing that, 2x price will rise'. All these '2x attack' doomsayers haven't come up with one plausible theory on what will happen. A fork is not an attack. The original coin doesn't cease to exist. If the mining power goes elsewhere, that is not an attack.
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:46:09
Still was never an attack smh
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:35:45
No proof. was actually the ones attacking this site and blaming mods. People like you are just are easily convinced by fake news.

Doesn’t matter if any of that was a coincidence or not. They can mine whatever they want.

@_date: 2017-11-24 01:18:19
How is the fork malicious? And if a miner wants to mine something that is not Bitcoin, who are we to say what they should be mining? I think BCH is promoted by very shady people and dumped my BCH immediately, but besides their spam transactions and FUD I don't see an attack.
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:47:52
I think the better question is more general - what's preventing the ISPs from controlling access to any specific content? For example, some of these ISPs have subsidiaries that create content i.e. compete directly with say Netflix. 
I think what would stop them would be the possible loss of customers. Piss off enough people and maybe people will move to wireless like hotspots.
@_date: 2017-11-24 03:03:04
You didn't really answer my question. If by "the segwit2x announcement" you mean when Bitgo CEO blogged about the cancellation, that was Nov 8. BCH was down Nov 8 from Nov 3's value.

No. I would not partake of ANY online casinos. I used Full Tilt - it was obviously rigged and then they were caught. Same with Seals and Clubs - one of the first BTC poker sites.

@_date: 2017-11-23 21:05:42
Sadly lots of people are susceptible to fake news. Fine with me - BTC is a finite resource. If gullible people are tricked away from it, more for the reasonable people to grab more at reasonable prices.

Unfortunately, it seems a lot of users just see what seems like a lot of research by an unrelated third-party and accept the premise. I, at first, even believed it. Then took 5 minutes to try and decipher what the hell was being proposed. It falls apart pretty quickly. censorship_notifier only monitors 3 Bitcoin-related subreddits - it's not some righteous bot monitoring all of reddit for censorship trends.
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:01:57
I'd say a thinly veiled attempt by to undermine The funny thing is this censorhip_notifier account could have scanned more than 3 subbreddits and it would have looked way more valid. Whoever came up with this idea to post as a righteous monitor of censorship couldn't think of the simple details. Then get people to tip, but coincidentally only tipping in BCH - lol, shows their true motive/connection. If they can't think of these details, how bad do you think their technology is? Software is all about the little details.

is moderated by Roger Ver. Convicted felon who owns Bitcoin.com and is trying to push Bitcoin Cash as "the real Bitcoin" (his own words). has launched numerous propaganda campaigns trying to trick people into believing things mods have done (censorship_notifier fake news).  has some of the core devs of Bitcoin as moderators. A lot of users here are on the defensive since Segwit2x was on its way and BCH happened.

Sorry you are correct. The S&amp;P is going the opposite direction as BTC the past few days....

Nice. Downloaded it. I wish the table view of holdings showed total holdings value per row instead of P/L.  
Also - would be nice if I could enter a sale in holdings.  
I'd also like to track my current holdings w/o having to enter purchase price. For example, I know I have 10 BTC and want to see how it goes up/down in value but don't remember all the ways I procured that total BTC.
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:01:10
"Literally is probably similar" lol huh
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:11:04
I hope so but every large dip is not the same. This one was due to some big news items (China, Jamie Dimon's opinion).

Depends on what you consider a big increase. Also, not really crashes. More like corrections.
