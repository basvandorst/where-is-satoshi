Wait, what? I don't see Andreas Antonopoulos anywhere in this photo...
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:38:00
What if he actually was Satoshi?

Instructions unclear. Started a game of hang man instead.

My question is what will be the incentive for people to continue mining bitcoin as it becomes more and more difficult to mine?
@_date: 2015-12-12 00:41:51
I just hope this equates to the price quadrupling so I can get paid.
@_date: 2015-12-09 16:56:47
haha yea it would. He insists that he's not satoshi but I don't buy it. He seems like one of the few people hellbent on making bitcoin hugely successful and every time I watch an interview with him or listen to his speeches, you can tell he cares very deeply about bitcoin.

My money is on Andreas Antonopoulus.

Wait wait wait. How do we know that's the REAL Donald Trump? Because it's 'verified' on Twitter? Nah bro, dude's definitely got handlers. Why do people even buy into this shit? I know Trump's a horrible dude, but cmon. Posting a tweet as if it were proof of something is silly.
@_date: 2016-01-15 09:09:56
Why not put a limit on the hashing power from the get go per miner so it doesn't become controllable by the very few?
@_date: 2016-01-15 23:41:25
Maybe he's doing this fully knowing the impact it would have on the price, then buy up as many bitcoin as he can before the price bounces back. 
@_date: 2017-03-12 05:18:21
So... Just like cash then.

Here, buy these when you can afford em:

Maybe not $1 million, but if the dollar continues to degrade with constant printing of money and inflation, prices will continue to rise in the dollar economy while wages continue to stagnate. This is an untenable solution that only a cryptocurrency can solve in the long run.

I think he's probably referring to the spike in bitcoin effectively being caused by the Brexit situation, but you give no proof to back up that claim. In fact, the price spiked well before the vote even occurred. There are likely many factors involved, and to single out Brexit as the only reason it spiked is doing a disservice to journalism and the bitcoin movement.

We all know who the real culprit is... Andreas Antonopoulos
@_date: 2019-04-16 09:05:47
It's nice to finally see you admit it, Andreas.
@_date: 2019-04-18 03:07:17
No, it's actually Andreas. Think about it.
@_date: 2019-04-16 20:02:49
I was just about to comment this lol. That would be epic.
@_date: 2018-03-26 23:37:36
If this happens, I will blame you.
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:44:33
No problem. Down with the man!

Wasn't the product he brought to market originally going to be shelved because it would not be profitable for businesses to offer it,  so he released it anyway despite the high cost(which he had no control of), as it was the only alternative option so people could still get their life saving medicine?

Their family lineage, dating all the way back to when they were apes, were too scared to wade through the shallow ocean waters, which is argued to be the primary reason apes developed such a big and complex hippocampus, paving the way for human evolution?

Let me just get myself securely out of debt real quick, then I'll be able to invest in Bitcoin. - said me a year ago, and I'm still drowning in debt.

I feel like we should get Mcafee and Ted Nugent in the same room together. 1 of 2 things can happen: 1 - They both get raging hardons talking about guns and Donald Trump and end up fucking each other on a bear rug, or 2 - They kill each other, as there can not exist 2 alpha males.

My guess is it will top out at $6666.66, then plummet to next to nothing after Satoshi Nakamoto withdraws all his BTC.
@_date: 2017-09-04 01:39:52
Lol, I saw a TED talk where an anthropologist discussed the idea that wading through shallow waters not only helped our brain evolve, but helped us to stand upright, as standing up while in the water is easier on the joints and skeletal system, so in effect, it boosted our evolutionary clock by a lot. This is just theory still, but it's interesting to consider a possibility.
@_date: 2017-09-04 05:02:55
Ah, yes. The stoned ape theory lol. I'm sure there's a number of factors that helped us evolve.

Silly billy, we all know who the real Satoshi is... The one man who is Blockchain's biggest advocate... 
Andreas Antonopoulos
@_date: 2015-11-13 20:24:42
Earlier this year they also announced they were taking a [light touch]( approach to Bitcoin instead of just throwing a bunch of regulations on it from the start which I think will help Bitcoin grow even faster.
@_date: 2015-11-13 19:25:20
Here's a good video where Andreas Antonopoulos discusses in great detail the benefits of Bitcoin to Canadian Senate members around this time last year:

Satoshi is obviously Andreas Antonopoulos, a great advocate and speaker for bitcoin and blockchain technologies.
