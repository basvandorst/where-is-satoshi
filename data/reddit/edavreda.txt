I dunno. My experience has been different. I didn't have to add a credit card for the student voucher. I did pay with PayPal previously though so it may have been waived. One reason why they probably did that is to prevent abuse.

Yeah. I ordered an Amazon GC from Gyft with coinbase. Bad idea. The 15 minutes came by and then after like another 15 minutes after the initial order I get an e-mail telling me my order was processed. I guess I lucked out. Never going to use coinbase to pay for things. Gonna send it to another wallet and then pay that way.

This is so awesome!
You actively add the new addresses, right?
@_date: 2013-11-23 22:41:25
Wait, you got half the bitcoins you ordered?

Oh. I was under the assumption that the link was an onion link, so we can't visit it unless we are running tor. But it is a proxy so we can visit it; Guess I was wrong. Sorry.

Have chase; They haven't called me yet.
@_date: 2013-04-02 01:30:14
Yeah, they just packed it :)
edit: you*?
@_date: 2013-11-24 03:32:24
Because that might not be true. You are supposed to receive the amount of bitcoins that you ordered from coinbase. Contact them.
@_date: 2013-06-02 16:17:31
Are you sure?

Bought some computer fans. $3 dollars cheaper than Newegg. This is awesome! How's the shipping speed?

You get the amount you ordered. If you ordered 1 BTC at $1 you will get 1 BTC even if it is worth $100 on the Friday that you are receiving the coins on. (I hope)
I ordered .05 bitcoins at 540 each, and got .05 bitcoins when they were worth 600ish.

Only one domain per account/per person/per household ;)

Full price.
