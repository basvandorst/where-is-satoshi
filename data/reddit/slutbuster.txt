Hi buddy. My name is Dan and I am from San Diego. I just wanted to drop in and say that there can be only one.
See you soon.

That's absurdly false. 
Like you said, you pay taxes on *profits.*
If you don't have a record of the purchase price to deduct, then - for tax purposes - you take 100% of the sale price as profit.

1. Bullshit. The IRS doesn't automatically audit you for overpaying taxes.
2 ...why would you *have* to prove a purchase of any asset, exactly? I'm failing to understand where you're getting this blatantly false idea.
Seems like you didn't actually come in here to have a discussion, seems like you came to pick a fight.

If you buy one bitcoin for $650, you'll be charged $650 when your payment clears, and you'll get one bitcoin.

Accepting a non-currency and paying out a non-currency? Replace bitcoins with points and you've got any play-for-fun online casino in the US... If it's not a recognized currency, it's not gambling.

Or the framer could use cash to buy drugs from a dealer and then plant the drugs on/in the victim's property.
I'm sure it's been done plenty of times, which is why I'd bet that most judges won't issue search warrants based on anonymous tips about small-time drug possession.
Now if the framer had thousands of dollars and access to the vacant property, maybe he could plant evidence of a major criminal enterprise - a meth lab, a cocaine cutting/distribution center, a marijuana grow... Those might be serious enough to go after based on an anonymous tip. Especially if the frame-job included evidence of illegal activity that could be seen from the street and used as probable cause (like leaving an open trash can full of weed trimmings on the corner.)
In any case, Silk Road is just going to complicate the process. Support your local businesses.

Then you're old enough to spell out the words "you", "you are", and "people".
This "u ppl r" shit is not how adults communicate. It's for kids.


You missed the point. No one expects Apple to allow any other forms of payment inside their little walled garden.
This is about apps.
Paypal has an iOS app. Square has an iOS app. You can't buy media or apps from the Apple market with Paypal, but you can use the Paypal app on an iPhone to pay 3rd parties.
Apple will not allow BitPay or Coinbase to offer their apps on iOS. Has nothing to do with Apple allowing or disallowing bitcoin when making payments in Apple-world.


I'm no Apple fan. I'd like them to have a more open software environment. Until then, I'll continue buying Android.

So does this mean that Bitcoin casinos operating in California will now be breaking the law when they pay out to Californians?

Yep, bartering is still taxed. And will be forever, because that'd be a huge loophole.

I'm assuming Overstock uses some service (maybe BitPay's API, maybe Coinbase, maybe even something developed in-house) to sell their BTC for fiat as soon as the transaction is confirmed. Not much volatility risk if they do.
Square is providing the same service for merchants, and I'm assuming that Square is selling to fiat in much the same way.
The only real risk for a company like Amazon is that they allow 3rd party sellers. Generally, if a buyer claims that he never received his order and the seller refuses to refund, Amazon can turn the dispute over to the credit card companies. With BTC, that option isn't available.
Of course, Amazon could mitigate that issue by withholding seller payouts until the refund window closes. They might even be doing that now. But if they aren't, it becomes a major logistical headache.
Amazon is usually ahead of the curve. I'm guessing that this is just more trouble than it's worth for them, since Gyft offers a relatively easy workaround through which BTC can be used for Amazon purchases.
It's all speculation of course, but it seems like a solid reason to me.r
@_date: 2014-04-01 09:09:23
Square does the conversion and pays the merchant in fiat.
I don't expect Square to hold onto BTC, but if they're selling back to an institution that's *not* an exchange and holds a large BTC reserve (BitPay or Coinbase), wouldn't it more or less bypass the open market altogether?

Did you read the article? Bitcoin wasn't created to be an investment vehicle, but its certainly become one.
Buying and holding bitcoin as a 3-5 year investment is a high-risk, decision with potential for high-rewards. And your ability to buy bitcoin now, while its still volatile and the price has the potential to go just about anywhere, gives you an investment opportunity that has many things in common with the investments that only VCs have access to.
It's not a perfect analogy, but it's similar enough to be a valid comparison.
Edit: The "profit" part of the headline is misleading. Of course you could see the same huge returns, but just like VCs, you also risk losing your entire investment.

If you own a brick-and-mortar and only accept BTC, you're gonna fail. It's a horrible business model. If you run an online shop and exclusively deal in BTC transactions, you're may not have the overhead that will equal certain failure, but you will be leaving a lot of money on the table, and you'll be less competitive than shops that offer a choice.
BTC should always be a choice. If you want to promote the currency, do what Gyft is doing and give people incentives to use BTC over PayPal or debit/credit (
much lower transaction fees that you can pass on to your customers.)
But the idea of only processing BTC transactions is a losing decision for any business that's not in a very narrow, high-risk niche. Online casinos and illicit goods, for example.
Two things need to happen before you see the average consumer start adopting BTC for day-to-day purchases:
1. Lower barrier to entry. They need to be able to be able to buy a prepaid Bitcoin card for cash at Wal-Mart. If it's more difficult than that, John Q. Public won't go out of his way to save 3% at the gas station.
2. Price stability. Which is a Catch-22, because stability is going to rely on BTC behaving like a currency, rather than a commodity. But until bitcoin value gets less volatile relative to fiat currency, it's too confusing for the average person, and it makes posting prices way to complicated for traditional merchants. Sure, you can say that you're charging "$3.50/gallon for gas - or BTC equivalent", but between the time the customer pulls up to the pump and the time they've finished filling their tank, their BTC-to-dollar ratio may have changed pretty dramatically. 
It's a great idea, but until those two issues are sorted out, it's not going to see that kind of universal adoption.

I bought gold with bitcoin a few weeks ago and saved a decent amount of money vs using credit/debit. (And a decent amount of time and hassle vs using ACH or check).
It's fun to actually use BTC for something practical. Don't be salty.

...how do those transactions get confirmed?
