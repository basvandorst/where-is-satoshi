This is sensationalist clickbait garbage, serving only to demean the reputation of bitcoin. You need to compare purchasing power and wages, not just one commodity price.

You have it backwards. A deflationary currency incentivizes saving over spending. 
@_date: 2017-09-25 19:10:31
Right. OP's post is the whole point of inflation. Anyone who advocates for a deflationary currency should understand that it will by definition deincentivize spending in favor of saving.

A good number of people post with this complaint, try to verify a credit card also. My transaction went through fine. Remember, unhappy people are more vocal than happy people, so you are more likely to see complaints than praise.

Basically, ridiculously high inflation

Don't learn what, that this is a great buying opportunity?

Why can't you buy back, just because you don't have the money back yet and that is the money you'd need to buy with?

On the flip side, I know some old guys who got caught up in onion speculation at one point. Instead of missing out on it, one guy sunk a massive portion of his life savings in a badly timed buy, and instead of trading onion futures, he ended up with truckloads of them delivered to his house! :)

In an environment where long positions are earning double digit percentages weekly, what could possibly possess someone to take on the risk involved with daytrading for what they percieve to be a best case 0.6% payoff? Ludicrous

Who the hell would downvote this post...

Ya, was thinking of cross posting there. Maybe after lunch. However, high Sharpe values encourage buy-and-hold strategies, which I think lines up more with The markets sub seems more interested in day trading topics.

It is kinda funny that they are so afraid, I just calculated the Sharpe Ratio of BTC to be 3.21 from 09-2011 to present. That is huge, and if it was a regular security, investors would be murdering each other to get in on it. The source of their hesitation, however, is understandable because the "value" of traditional stocks/investments is defined in a way that make them comparable to eachother, but not really comparable to BTC.

Why can't we like... talk to them, or something. Maybe write them a letter? Is reddit censored in Chinese ISPs?

You may not have English as you primary language, so I'll just let you know that it is actually a Bald Eagle, named because of the white feathers on its head contrasting the black body. Interesting that it sounds close to Bold though, many Americans might like that you think that.

Probably just a reaction to the correction in China: [Chart](

I've been denied a couple times so far, and know for a fact that the answers I gave were correct. As others have stated, I've been through these types of verification tests for other purposes and NEVER have they been so asinine.
