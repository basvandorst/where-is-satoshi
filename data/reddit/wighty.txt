Agreed somewhat. On the contrary argument if you bought Bitcoin at the highs over the past month you've now lost up to 40-50% of your money whereas if you bought stocks/indexes you'd be up still. It's all about perspective.

That is honestly a really bad point for you to be trying to make.
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:05:12
Yeah, but none of the highest market cap stocks are going to lose that unless there is a market wide correction, and there's no "high flyer" crypto than bitcoin. What you just said would be like you predicting Apple is going to be $90 in a month. That's just not going to happen without some serious market wide action. I can make the same exact comparison right now where the majority of cryptos just lost 15-20% of their value in a day. Do you have any idea what kind of mass panic would occur if the total stock market lost that? It looks like from this site the DJIA has only once lost more than 15% in a day (-22.61% in 1987):   
  
You absolutely are allowed to compare cryptos to stocks. Right now they are both more or less investment vehicles. The use case for cryptos as actual currencies is such a minuscule use of the technology. That may change, but I think we are &gt;10 years from seeing if that is true or not.

You are right, I sent that when I woke up and actually was going to go back and edit/apologize for it. My original post would have been more accurate if I just left it at index ETF/funds but to be honest the level of investor knowledge is not that high in this subreddit, at least for the people that actually post, so I stated stocks with the implication of talking about large cap and well known companies, which even if some of them have gone down a few points the overall market is up still, and certainly the household names have not dropped 40%.

You think the US only represents 3-5%? The first few links on Google trying to estimate it say maybe 5% of Americans own Bitcoin, which puts it around 15 million people, and the same page I saw estimates 28 million world wide. That's just talking about active wallets though, and doesn't paint the picture of actual percent of ownership, which I would estimate is actually a higher percentage than active users.

I don't think you can compare Bitcoin to prohibition. It doesn't have nearly the traction (popularity) or use compared to a consumable substance.  It's best use case right now is a store of value, if it is banned that goes away. I wouldn't be surprised if the price went below $500 and stays there for a decade if the US banned it right now.

I realize I didn't type out the most eloquent post, but no I didn't mean bitcoin would be maxing out the plant, but rather the population as it is built up around the plant (ie in the future as the plant approaches its projected capacity that they planned for based on population studies, company development, etc). In that situation you now have the general population being supplied around the plant competing against the bitcoin miners, thus raising price. Not exactly a "green coin" situation as Andreas put it.

Is there any evidence/examples of his points here? I mean they make sense somewhat, but I am completely skeptical of "mining" being the driver "decentralized energy production". Yes bitcoin takes up a lot of energy in mining, but it is actually still quite small compared to overall energy production/usage. I just don't like his verbiage here and I want to see actual concrete examples of "hey we are going to build a new power plant because we want to bring in miners" because I don't believe that is actually happening. It is much, much more likely that it is the miners going to the power plants that have overproduction of current energy and now offering cheap energy to make up their capital expenditures. But what happens once that power plant is now at capacity from need other than mining? Are these miners now going to completely pack up their warehouse and move it to the next new power plant? Again, I'm skeptical that will be what happens most of the time.

Actually you would be liable for taxes on the gains from holding eur.. the big difference is those fluctuations are no where near like Bitcoin so it isn't like it is usually worth the effort to go after someone for it usually. Money market trading is a real thing.
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:47:34
I meant you owe taxes on the increase in value of the Bitcoin, which could be capital gains tax or at your current income tax level depending on when you spend it. That isn't the same as being double taxed though, it is as if you are taking your paycheck and investing it immediately. You've paid the income tax, then whatever your assets appreciate you will owe taxes on as well. There is no way getting around that gains tax unless your account is in a Roth designated account. You are right that you will also be able to tax looks harvest if you're lose value.

I think you'd be due for taxes on any gains still. Your cost basis would be your salary at the time it was paid. This seems like it could be really annoying to keep track of if the boss isn't doing it for him automatically (unlike say buying on an exchange where those transactions are saved).

I think you don't understand that you don't have to pay any additional tax on the asset scenario as long as the asset hasn't appreciated in value. Your cost basis is whatever the price was when you were paid, so if you use it at the same price there is no additional tax owed.

I know, but I wouldn't commit to a short contract like the one he was proposing without having a guaranteed minimum time. If I covered the short early I'd obviously pay the correct amount of interest! If I had an exact time frame I'd actually much prefer to get into options contracts instead, woo.

I was not being serious, just making a point about the mechanism for short selling.  It's great that you were immediately ready to offer your BTC for use, but that isn't exactly a reasonable thing to assume to most people involved in bitcoin. I would also never, ever take 10% interest.

I'm actually not well versed on the exact fees behind shorting stock, so I'm just gonna make up some stuff. Would you be willing to lend 10 BTC at, say 2% yearly interest, for the next 1 year (at a minimum)? ie you are giving me those 10 BTC and I'm paying you $200 or so to borrow the BTC for the year. Because that would be the mechanism behind short selling.
@_date: 2014-01-30 01:39:11

@_date: 2014-01-30 19:05:45
FFS that isn't shorting. Read some intro guides to the stock market. You are placing bets on that site. Shorting would literally be selling a borrowed bitcoin to someone at a specified price, and then you return the borrowed bitcoin at a later date (with the hope that it is cheaper). The whole point of shorting is to have negative price pressure so that if the market thinks something is overvalued they can actually influence the price downward (ie short sellers will continue to sell bitcoin at lower and lower prices to make sure they sell until they think the actual value price has been reached).  Otherwise you get almost exactly like what is happening with bitcoin, the vast majority of big stake holders just hold onto their bitcoin and create more demand for it by limiting supply on the market. And yes, I'm treating bitcoin more like a commodity than currency because that is what I believe it is behaving like at the current time.
@_date: 2014-01-30 02:52:48
Can you show me where it allows you to short btc? I see bets more akin to options plays, not short selling.
@_date: 2014-01-30 21:20:54
Seriously, go read.  
  
Edit: here, this starts to explain:   
You are correct in that predictious is the closest thing to being able to monetize your belief in bitcoin's value falling, but it still isn't short selling.
@_date: 2014-01-30 05:10:28
Are you talking about the bets like "Price of Bitcoin January 31st to be more than $1000"? That isn't shorting, these are almost like options in the stock market (though not really at all). You are placing a bet, it's quite disconnected from the bitcoin market. A true short would place downward pressure on the overall price of bitcoin. If I'm wrong please correct me.
@_date: 2014-02-05 22:16:47

@_date: 2014-01-30 02:22:04
I was upvoting you until now. I very clearly wrote what my point was half an hour ago. I'm very happy for you and your endeavors. Congrats. Four years ago I didn't have the balls to put $500 into bitcoin like I mulled over for a month (at the time I was just starting grad school, so it wasn't an insignificant amount for someone with no real income). You've quite obviously been the correct one on that call. I just hope that you learn about humility sometime in the near future.
@_date: 2014-01-14 02:48:09
I don't really have a concern about the computing power required, as you say it is pretty much self regulating. Does anyone know how many transactions the network can process? IIRC back in November at the senate hearings it was artificially limited to 6/second? Comparing to 20,000/s for Visa/MC?  Would the system get overwhelmed and backlogged if people decided to just slam the network with sham transactions?
@_date: 2014-01-14 04:27:05
yeah that is kind of what I thought.  Has there ever been talk about this as a method of attack?
@_date: 2019-11-20 20:45:47
I really don't think you are going to see that high of gains from playing just yearly options (unless you are already starting off with a large sum of money). You would have to be trading much more frequently. If I had a good resource for historical options pricing we could do some testing of it but I don't have access to that.  
  
 And if we are going to talk about trying to time the market with options, I would still argue it would probably be easier to do it with Bitcoin. The above $1 to $160,000 analysis is doing a single trade, but if you got relatively close to trading on Bitcoin's peaks and troughs that $1 could actually be around $190 million based on 8 trades (buy 20btc at $0.05, sell at $30, buy at $2, sell at $200, buy at $90, sell at $1100, buy at $200, sell at $18,000 and finally re-buy at $3500). If you can do that in 8 options trades I will concede.
@_date: 2019-11-20 23:52:52
Okay, that still doesn't really matter though. Put $3.6k into bitcoin in 2010 at $0.05 and that is $576 million currently. So again just a single investment and order and we are essentially in line with your single all in... this would also give you the option of selling at any point so you can use that money (rather than continuing to live on $36k a year until your one single bet).
  
Just out of curiosity, do you think you would be able to buy an options position that would cover over 50% of outstanding shares? I don't doubt that you could buy a good portion, I just feel like someone trying to buy that level would not keep the price of the call at $1... nor that it would even be $1 to begin with, though I don't look at calls OTM 3 years out.
@_date: 2019-11-26 05:01:06
Right? You are talking about a literal financial institute. It essentially is *only* about pricing.
@_date: 2019-11-21 18:10:00


And were they a consortium of 28 countries? No.
@_date: 2019-11-20 21:59:50
You are changing the original starting point in your analysis. Rather than starting with $1, you are talking about $25,000. $25,000 * $160,000 = $4 billion (and sure, I'm overestimating here assuming you put $25k in at the very beginning rather than $3.6k a year, but if we are talking about trading look at my edit and see how you could turn $1 into $190MM on around 8 trades, just knowing the peaks/troughs and not worrying about having to actually know the exact timing.  
  
I will concede that it isn't impossible to do it with options trading, but I still argue it is easier with knowing the price history of bitcoin and would take less effort. You bring up a good point about the share float/moving the market yourself, so I am sure my $190MM might have some influence and the actual number would be different.

More details and actual arguments, less rhetoric.
@_date: 2019-11-23 19:57:10
I understand where you are coming from, but there's more to it than just the underlying costs of mining. If there are no buyers willing to pay the current prices, then prices will inevitably fall (it is not a matter of if, but when)... and that could go below the cost of mining. Think about a lot of the US fracking companies that are operating below profitability, the issue is they have spent the up front capital and are trying to recuperate whatever they can (up until they go bankrupt). The difference with miners is that if they go bankrupt/stop mining then eventually the difficulty will adjust and keep the system moving.
@_date: 2019-11-21 17:18:42

I don't think you can find any single one play that would outperform Bitcoin's rise over the last decade. A series of leveraged options plays might get you there but unless you have encyclopedic memory of price action of a stock (both price and date) I'm not sure you would be able to do it, and even if you do it is not going to be anywhere near as easy as buying Bitcoin "once".

Authors argument has more than just a statement like yours, it has at least some semblance of research and evidence backing it up. The counter argument is to actually come up with evidence disproving it or your analysis showing his conclusion/research is flawed, not just spouting you think it is wrong.

Well... Considering 3% of &gt;$30 trillion is &gt;$900 billion, or almost 5 times the size of the entire market cap of Bitcoin, I'd say it is a little warranted to worry compared to Bitcoin's bigger percentage drops.  
  
If I do damage to my house worth 5% of its value I'm going to be a lot more upset than if I drop my phone and destroy it (100% value loss).
@_date: 2019-08-17 20:05:57
A lot more money is in the stock market, more people have money in the stock market, and a 3% drop destroys a shitload more wealth in the stock market compared to Bitcoin, so of course the media and public at large is going to make a bigger deal about it.

I made this post earlier and was hoping someone could fact check/point out the error (because it seems like I made one)?  


  
Click on "All time" and try to look at the hash rate at the beginning blocks throughout 2009. The first year seems to range anywhere from 0.5M to 9M, average somewhere in 3-5M? If I am reading that right, it is 500,000 hash/sec to 9 million hash/sec.  
  


  
Intel E7300, retail price of a little over $100 and released in Q3 2008, so easily available. This would be a low/mid range CPU. It does 2.5 million hash/sec as stated in that post. That single CPU could be roughly 50% of the network for almost the first year, when 2.6 million bitcoins were mined. If I am reading the numbers correctly, that means you would actually own about 1.3 million bitcoin if you were able to start mining at the genesis block and did it 24/7. (this seems way too generous to me, so I admit I'm probably wrong with this calculation).

Yeah it was just part of a reply to the reddit thread about being transported back to 2005 with your current knowledge (front page from yesterday). So basically what I was not sure about was how long it was just Satoshi/Hal mining on the network, which looks like it was a good majority of the first year.  
  


  
In the context of the post, this wouldn't be a concern because the theoretical is the person would know it would be worth a lot of money. Someone was arguing that you were better off buying the bitcoin than spending money on "high end rigs"... my point to him was that if you knew the starting point you could get in and use most any old PC to mine more bitcoin at the very start than you would be able to buy later when they were starting to be traded.

Other than "good on you for doing this at such a young age", this was the biggest thought I had.

I just went through it again and it actually worked this time (3rd time trying it). It is as you say, it's just the program wasn't letting me click next after typing in the first 12 word program generated seed, and then the next screen it asks to confirm your custom words.

@_date: 2017-11-04 19:11:10
I don't know why you are so upset (edit: maybe not upset, just spending the time trying to explain mathematically something I understood when I was 10) about wanting to add your own randomness to it on the exceedingly slim chance that the underlying code is "broken" and reverse engineered to make any 12 word seeds generated by it easily broken.

I think if you changed it to income based taxing only you'd have to change the tax loss harvesting rules. Something simple would be no limit on the tax loss and you can carry forward indefinitely. Of course you'd have to make sure this couldn't create loopholes (I don't know enough about the tax code to adequately say definitive recommendations).  
  


  
Again this seems like speculation to me. I'd love to see definitive evidence that would show an increase in the tax rate actually leads to decreased investment... what else are the people going to do with the money? edit: caveat here... decrease in investment over the long term. I imagine you could find some short term decrease if any changes in the taxes are thought to be not indefinite, but even still this is usually limited to when people try to take the profits (when there is the actual tax hit).

If trading coins, presumably you are exchanging your coins at the same usd value so you would only owe taxes if you want to redefine your cost basis right? Ie you have 1 BTC at a cost basis of $1000 USD, if you trade it for the equivalent ethereum you could pay gains tax on the $1000 to $8000 increase and you now consider your cost basis for the ethereum to be $8000, or alternatively you don't pay taxes and your cost basis for the ethereum is $1000?

I really don't like it when people say "make a plan and stick to it". It's such a definitive statement when any number of things can occur that it would be foolish not to adjust your strategy.

The IRS doesn't care about the source, but that doesn't mean law enforcement and prosecutors will turn a blind eye.

I hate it when people say shit like this. He's allowed to hedge by not short selling, and plan on making his money just with the buy based on his thesis/prediction. If he is planning on buying at $2500 he is just putting himself at higher risk short selling into that position. 
@_date: 2018-11-11 03:07:50
Hmm, so that's like what, $1500 total or something like that for the cost of the 2 these days? So 8 month return on investment, plus I guess we are heading into the winter months for some so maybe you get some duel benefit with the heating. That's not... terrible. If I could say the same thing for GPU mining I'd go for it because you could always use them as for playing games, but if the S9 becomes unprofitable for mining per cost I'd hate to have that as a paperweight.  
  
Edit: did a little further searching, looks like you might be able to get S9+psu for more like $350? So $700 investment, 4 month pay off. Not too bad. 
@_date: 2019-01-13 19:09:00
I'm not sure what you think you need to prove here, the IRS will consider your cost basis to be 0 if you don't have any proof on where it comes from, which in this case is accurate. I don't think they are going to give any thought at all about the origin, especially with crypto where there are going to be a lot of people that won't have any real way to prove their origin (particularly early miners or off exchange transactions). AFAIK the IRS doesn't give any thoughts for illegally obtained income either, as long as you claim it and pay the appropriate taxes.

Just want to point out here that this is not a binary move. You can pump a price by spending a LOT of money very quickly, and then selling off slower to make money while the price takes longer to stabilize from the pump. The reason this works is because your pump is meant to draw in a lot more money than just yours, and they tend to not know when to sell off/hold on longer than the pumper. If you sell off just as quickly as you purchase then yes, your statement would be true.

Hopping on the credit card point, if you have never had a credit card before that initial application to finally getting the card and being able to use it could easily exceed 1 week.

You treat the taxable event as if you sold it. You calculate the price at the date you traded, then subtract your cost basis. You pay it as short term if you held less than a year, and long term if you held longer than a year. If you aren't following I can type out an example when I'm back from work.
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:03:06
For this past tax year it is a little ambiguous. Starting in 2018 you are creating a taxable event any time you are exchanging one coin for another. I think to be on the safe side I would consider treating it as the rules have been clarified for 2018 going forward.

@_date: 2018-02-04 16:52:27
I was more curious about seeing the data. This looks convincing enough for me (along with my leftover knowledge from physic 1-4): 
@_date: 2017-10-21 13:55:22
Small use cases are fine. You are in the less than 0.1% though I bet.
@_date: 2017-10-19 19:16:08
Can you explain what the benefit is for doing this? Using just a regular computer doesn't contribute like anything to the overall hash rate correct? Is it more of a statement against 2x?
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:00:25
I think you are correct. The only hesitation I would have is whether or not the BCH would still be considered LTCG. My best comparison to this would probably be a stock split, so if you sell the extra shares I believe those are considered to be purchased on your original date and not the split date.
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:50:48
I've never seen an attempt to do that.
@_date: 2018-02-04 16:54:16
Haha I just found that link a few minutes ago as well :) I was just looking for some data like that. It doesn't go through large HVAC/whole home systems but it is probably close enough as you say.
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:30:55


...no, I'm not.
@_date: 2017-09-25 04:04:57
Can anyone chime in here... I really don't think Bitcoin is deflationary anymore because it can be forked.
@_date: 2018-02-05 02:24:11
I suggest listening to the This American Life episode about money that came out probably 5 years ago.  
  
Edit: 
@_date: 2019-09-09 22:54:41
Maybe it is just one part of the gift?
@_date: 2018-02-08 19:52:47
There is one way this could be safe. Accept the payment and don't send the Bitcoin for 180 days (which I believe is the last day someone can try and reverse the payment).
@_date: 2017-10-20 23:19:00
I get annoyed at all of the people on this subreddit that refuse to acknowledge what you just said. Bitcoin is only a place to store value right now IMO.
@_date: 2017-10-18 04:31:49
I think we've kind of proven that trickle down economics doesn't work.
@_date: 2017-10-18 04:29:49
Does the ledger include the information about how much you actually spent in USD?
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:38:00
Still wouldn't help if it was a consensus amongst all of the majority governments, no? If all ISPs were forced to block it VPNs wouldn't help. I obviously don't see this happening.
@_date: 2019-09-22 21:53:26
I'm all for promoting Bitcoin, but I agree the original post doesn't make any sense. Maybe try making the argument about the quickest appreciating asset?
@_date: 2017-10-19 19:10:24
If you read my post I was saying if that crash occurs prior to more widespread adoption of Bitcoin. If you can't directly use the Bitcoin to pay for food, gas, rent or mortgage then you'd have to liquidate it to fiat in the same situation people had to unload their stocks to make ends meet around 2008 to 2010. I think it will be a very interesting situation if there is another financial crash in the next 5 years.
@_date: 2018-04-23 13:56:42
Thanks for your excellent DD.
@_date: 2017-10-31 19:02:19
It would be pretty funny if their whole intention was to get rich enough to buy Facebook.
@_date: 2018-04-19 03:26:18
Definitely exaggerating. That's like $150 with a market cap of $150 billion :D
@_date: 2018-04-19 17:14:57
Nope. His initial number is a percent, you need to divide by another 100.
@_date: 2018-04-10 18:20:49
Because anecdotes are better than your sources, duh.
@_date: 2018-04-12 23:44:52
This is absolutely a pump. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 05:36:04
You definitely screwed up. With that said, in my experience most scammers will stop communicating once they get their money, so there is a chance he really is just having trouble with his bank.
@_date: 2018-04-19 14:58:36
Ah yeah you are probably right. Increase my number to $150,000, which is also probably quite low.
@_date: 2017-05-26 00:39:40
Well take some solace that reading your woes makes my thought of spending $100 when they were $0.05 at the start of grad school much less depressing.
@_date: 2019-05-13 19:09:11




I'm sorry but you have clearly delusional thinking here. Whenever I see people compare stocks to gambling but then right away say (or are at least implying) Bitcoin is more stable they immediately lose all credibility. Both have their risks, and smart investors would still consider stocks a much safer bet.
@_date: 2019-05-12 15:40:24
This wouldn't matter to a sufficiently large whale.
@_date: 2018-12-20 14:50:17
&lt;insert "until it doesn't" quip&gt;
@_date: 2019-05-19 22:33:42
$14 million is all it would take to get the price up to $14k? Um, no.
@_date: 2018-12-03 18:47:12
Well this is certainly going to predict the price 2 months from now.
@_date: 2018-12-05 17:40:35
Foreplay is easy, hindplay is hard.
@_date: 2018-12-07 04:47:18
Better than investing and holding onto HMNY (moviepass) through that same time period!
@_date: 2018-12-21 02:18:08
I went back and re-read, I think I understand my confusion. You stated "commercial banks do not create US dollars" and I kind of skipped over that. They are part of the process, but I think you are just saying that it ends up being the Fed is really creating the money, right? 
@_date: 2019-05-13 19:16:34
The tone very much seems to be implying what I said, that you think Bitcoin is less of a gamble than stocks.
@_date: 2018-12-25 03:26:20
mmm... yeah you should use a better number than that for Apple. Current valuation $697b with about $240b cash on hand. They are at a minimum worth 34% of the current valuation in cash alone, neglecting literally everything else.
@_date: 2018-12-20 23:52:42


Isn't the point not that it is actually like a physical equivalent, but that you are changing the balances on ledgers which are now all done digitally? So not "digital USD" like bitcoin is digital, but digital in the fact that it is all done electronically.
@_date: 2018-12-19 06:20:07
I, too, watched Andreas' explanation of this.
@_date: 2013-11-19 06:22:01
I don't really follow mining a whole lot... but can someone give me an estimate of the processing power of the latest ASIC vs the first ASIC vs say a few Radeon 4850s (IIRC these were popular for mining early on)?
@_date: 2018-12-03 20:09:49
My interpretation: girl on the left is huffing the Bitcoin glue. Girl on the right was found guilty of checking the price too often and for punishment they took an eye and gave her a Bitcoin patch.
@_date: 2013-11-28 03:58:30
Or better yet, announce it when you don't actually have it to waste the hackers time!
@_date: 2019-05-01 00:07:47
If that is the case, I'd say Satoshi would have a good argument he owes $0 in taxes for mining still since the price at the time was $0 (note I don't know when the last blocks under the supposed satoshi were mined, so maybe they were in to the pennies region but still a pittance compared to overall amount). Satoshi would definitely owe capital gains though.
@_date: 2013-12-19 00:22:12
Hah, there's no way bitcoin uses less energy per transaction.
@_date: 2013-12-09 03:18:28
My understanding is that there are many branches coming off the end of a blockchain, and only one ends up being added to the blockchain ledger after it is solved.  What happens to the transactions that were part of a block that ends up not getting added?
@_date: 2013-12-23 06:35:10
Would it only take 2 tries?
@_date: 2013-11-28 04:43:26
Everyone on this sub would disagree with you.
(the total market cap of bitcoin would then only be around $25 billion).
@_date: 2013-12-09 04:31:49
It does to an extent, and this was kind of my understanding... but says, for the transactions in 3a, since they aren't added to the block chain they didn't actually happen.  So say I send btc from my wallet to someone else's and that transaction was in 3a. Now 3a is discarded... that transaction is then discarded.  If I actually sold btc for USD to that second wallet owner, now that owner loses out on his btc without my good will?  
  
Or is it that once 3a is abandoned, all the transactions are added to a new upcoming block trying to be solved? (this seems like it could lead to problems in and of itself)
@_date: 2013-12-14 03:07:16
Necro post, but just have to say I occasionally have thoughts that it is the banking system and government behind bitcoin... hey, maybe it was designed as a way to pay off the US debt :P
