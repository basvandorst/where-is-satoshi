wow, this is a good idea, maybe someone should try creating a mathematical model to use on the stock market!!!

holy shit so much misinformation in this thread.  I really hope nobody takes any of the tax answers/comments here as fact without verifying independently.

bought at 7k, not selling til its long-term capital gains (or long-term capital losses :D ) at the very least.

well, maybe just buy a traditional investment at this point.  because nobody really has any idea where bitcoin or cash are going, could be you switch back, then bitcoin drops to 7k and cash goes to 3k.

lol you must trust your friends to keep track of a usb/piece of paper for weeks/months/years a lot more than me.

bitcoin is a terrible way to teach kids about investing and finances.

because you dont know when its going up and when its going down, and how much.  
could just as easily sell, but then it keeps going up, then what do you do, buy back in while its higher, missing more gains? then maybe you buy and it goes back down, then what, do you sell and start the cycle all over again?

dude just look up the words.  you're on the internet you have access to it.  why say something wrong with such conviction when you could easily just actually check.

a 6-7k correction means dropping by 6-7k, not dropping to 6-7k.

this seems like maybe a good place for me to ask my super stupid question that i've been trying to understand.
i have a trezor, but during setup it makes me create an account with trezor wallet the website.  if my trezor is unplugged, is my wallet offline? or since i access via the trezor website (but can only access it while my hardware is plugged in), its an online wallet?

i have a trezor hardware wallet, during setup it had me create an account with the trezor wallet website.  i can only access my account on the website if the hardware is connected.  when i disconnect the trezor hardware, is my wallet now offline? or because i created the account on the website, it's now an online wallet?
