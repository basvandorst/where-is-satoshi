I bought most of it ~1000, and I'm still holding because it is an investment for the long run, I didn't buy for quick exchange...

yes! the one that starts with 1kaipi? it's my vanity address, my nickname is kaipi.. :)
if you manage to make the functions, if you want, I can add them to the gist, with proper attributions of course... ;)

I think you have to ask explicitly for the buy or sell depth, and then the results will appear in the spreadsheet, something like:
    function getBuyDepth(market_id, nonce) {
      var depth = cryptsyRequest({method: "depth", marketid: market_id});
      return depth.buy;
    }    
    function getSellDepth(market_id, nonce) {
      var depth = cryptsyRequest({method: "depth", marketid: market_id});
      return depth.sell;
    }

yeah, you shoudl replace the &lt;Key&gt; with the actual key, in the following format
    var cryptsy_private_key = "123abc455asdf";
The code will fail until you provide the keys in this format.
Best regards!

there we go, i've updated the gist... thanks!
@_date: 2014-01-22 18:11:55
is this you? 1KhrTX...
then thanks! :)
@_date: 2013-12-25 18:56:56
thanks mate! you're awesome!

'cause you know, bitcoins don't destroy forests...
@_date: 2013-12-20 03:55:07
ok, yeah, it wasn't very flexible for other inputs, but I just updated it for it to be!
now, if you want, for example, your trades, you would create a function like this
    function getCryptsyTrades() {
      var trades = cryptsyRequest({method: "mytrades", marketid: 71});
      Logger.log(trades);
    }

i have only 25% on exchanges, the rest is in offline storage (encrypted mac DMG on dropbox)
@_date: 2013-12-19 15:36:29
yeah, but more forests = more air cleaning power, so there's that

i bought my six coins at an average of 1000, i'm also at nine, but not willing to go any further
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:51:59
is this related to seeing 0 BTC balance in my account? 
edit: estimated portfolio value
@_date: 2013-12-03 03:28:03
im just getting in now, and I believe that in a while, 1000 USD/BTC is going to be considered cheap... so.... we're still early :)
@_date: 2013-12-13 14:45:16
just as cryptsy knows your private keys, and any other exchange
@_date: 2013-12-16 03:09:55
that's something I still haven't figured out... I was thinking of a service that pings you every month, and if you don't respond in 2 months, it sends an automated message to certain contacts with all the passwords you have... the hard part of that service is convincing everyone to store their passwords on a service, which can't be encrypted or has to be easily decrypted...
@_date: 2013-12-19 17:11:46
i guess 15 now, but skipped 10 to 14
@_date: 2013-12-15 05:19:19
thank you! :)
i edited the gist to use the last mtgox price, before i was using another api which was a 24h average
