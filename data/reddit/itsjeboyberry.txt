i am on a bad decision streak so this doesnt help haha. first lost 10% btc in de ''correction'' last weekend. yesterday i buyed LTC right on the point that it went down, and sold it within a few minutes. now i look at the price of LTC and hear the ''hello darkness my old friend'' song in my ears.

LTC was a fast buck for those who were smart ( not like me, panic sold yesterday and lost some money)

i wish i stayed strong last week :( thougth i was going to sell it and buy it cheaper. i sold it right on the bottom.. rip 10% BTC
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:48:45
high risk high reward is the deal right. some men take this one step higher.

@_date: 2017-12-12 13:20:48

@_date: 2017-12-08 14:55:09

idk mate watch litecoin for a few hours and if its not going down just buy for a few k litecoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:24:08
