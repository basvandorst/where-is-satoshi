 Censorship 


 Discrimination


What PayPal is doing is both censorship and discrimination. I don't like InfoWars or the guy behind it. But that doesn't mean it isn't censorship. Just because this isn't the government doing it doesn't mean it isn't censorship, as censorship isn't the fourth amendment which only deals with the government ability to control speech. Anybody restricted information is censoring it
Now is what PayPal doing wrong? I don't think so it a private company they can do whatever they want and people would decide to use them or not. But we can say if it's good for their business or not.

A lot of Africa isn't mapped and the lot of the rainforests are not as well.

The only post apocalyptic scenario where gold is good for anything is jewellery but then you would have to wait a bit for people to be good at the basic needs before gold becomes valuable again.

How is it support to work without everybody agreeing they spent the money or the majority. Just having two people saying they transferred money isn't enough as far as I know.

So it will only work if there is enough people around you? How much is enough do you think?

Bitcoin is going to fail before gold is mine from asteroids.
I think cryptocurrency is going to be around for some time to come. But I don't think bitcoin is going to outlast gold. It is still going to be expensive to mine asteroids. And like with diamonds they are not going to let the gold price crumble. And if it does you have some nice metal for jewellery and/or computer components. But if bitcoin fails you just have some worthless numbers on your hard drives.

Do you know why they stopped using Bitcoin? It is still on the help pages. So I assume it's recent.

It's a lot less than that

Yeah, if that's the case I wouldn't trust experts as well as I have no way you are verifying what they are saying.

I don't mean to $20,000 but to the up and down has seemed to have stoped. I know it has been on a gradual decline since the $20,000 but it is seems to just be falling off cliffs at the moment.
