From what I understand it's the same process as Bitinstant if you do the cash deposit. You don't have to actually meet anyone, they assign you a specific number amount to deposit, like $200.13 or something. When you deposit it, they send you the BTC. Pretty much how the cash deposits at Bitfloor and Bitinstant used to go before they stopped. It actually seems easier to me than the whole ZipZap thing, IMO.
Also, I'm a girl, so dudess or something. :)

I am female. I bitcoin. I just don't really feel the need to point out my gender every time I post, so it mostly goes unnoticed. I would bet there are more women that are interested in bitcoin than you imagine.

It's so hit or miss. A few weeks ago I used their Zipmark service (not available anymore) to buy BTC with my bank account, instantly. The very next day I tried to make a larger purchase which has STILL not been executed, two weeks later. I have been charged for the second, larger amount and essentially recieved nothing but support emails telling me they're working on it. I will probably not continue to use their service after this, IMO it is totally unacceptable to hold my money like this and keep stringing me along. Though I have used their ZipZap payment option in the past, I have also heard of others experiencing similar problems using this method. I would advise using another service, coinbase or localbitcoins.

They don't have an integrated checkout, you message me and I send you an invoice based on market value.

Sorry if I came off irritable, this is just one of my pet peeves: when guys act oh-so-surprised when girls like computers, crytocurrency, coding, video games, porn, science, reddit, etc.. one of my other pet peeves is when girls play on this assumption to get attention (see: girls gone bitcoin). Of course you were only curious and asking for feedback and deserve none of my misplaced annoyance, my apologies.

I have a ton of just regular acrylic plugs, maybe I will start just offering them! I've also considered adding some things like scrabble or keyboard tiles that could be worn by either sex. I am also going to be adding regular post earrings as well. Thanks for the ideas and feedback!

Well mine seems to be have troubles as well, using the Zipmark app. Yesterday it worked like a charm and went through nearly instantly. Not so much today. It's stuck at "Payment Initiated" event though I've paid the invoice. Customer support just gave me the generic "give it 24 hours". Guess I'll give it 24 hours ....

Yes! I have made a few pairs and just need to take photos and make the listings. Hopefully I should have time over the weekend to get a few pairs on the shop, so check back soon. Thanks for the kind words!

[My CoinGig Link]( I am still putting the new listings up but it's got some featured items.

If you ma'am me, I will moon you. Just sayin'.

Coinbase, it takes a week, but when I saw that my Bitinstant order hadn't cleared my bank after like 4-5 days, I went ahead and placed another order. If you need coins sooner there are people on localbitcoins that process cash deposits at banks, see [this link]( which shows the users online who do cash deposits. Make sure to check their feedback, etc, before making the purchase.

Wow, I just tried this as well and even though it says there may be a 2-day hold for your first transaction, mine literally took 10 seconds. It took longer for me to set up accounts at bitinstant and zipmark than it did for the BTC to come through.. No more running all over town for moneygrams, no more waiting a week for my bank clearance, INSTANT! I love it!
@_date: 2013-07-11 14:27:44
Yeah, it really sucks because I went ahead and spent the money elsewhere thinking that the order wouldn't go through. So I've essentially paid for twice the bitcoins I intended to buy, and only received half. So I am extra broke and it's gonna be a ramen week next week. Considering selling the coin I did get. :(
@_date: 2013-07-09 13:12:50
Yeah, sorry, maybe I should have clarified more!

Can I add my Etsy store? I handmake jewelry, while it is mostly aimed toward women, I know there are some lady bitcoiners out there. Plus gift ideas!
I'm at [PerfectionPetals]( and I accept bitcoins.

Yeah, no kidding. Who are you since you know me? Elvis? 
@_date: 2013-09-02 13:55:08
I actually do have listings on CoinGig. I will link when not on mobile!

When it went to $15 last summer I kept waiting for it to fall back to around $6 or $7.. sigh..
