Well, there is a reason why he is a politician and not an engineer. Thinking is not his thing.

Because their stream is the worst thing ever made, and they know it.

I have a better alternative. Why not go and lobby the existing government, that has a monopoly on force and legislation, to use only 'that' private company for selling electricity.

Because other fiat currencies don't lose value like.... all the time. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 17:30:40
but governments already own courts and prisons..... and they have a monopoly on the rules. Don't you see the irony in your comment?

Very simple. Child indoctrination, similar to religion. For example my parents are way more religious than me (I'm an atheist actually) because they were forcefully thought that way. While I was left alone to figure it out, and I did at 14 when I was smart enough.
Once children stop being forced to go to government schools we will be able to see changes. Force and violence towards children is the root of the problem!

A law cannot be broken! It just shouldn't exist.

Ah I remember the good old days when Bitcoiners were only libertarians and anarchists. I guess we are going mainstream.

private security, private construction companies, private courts..... basically voluntary services that the community wants/needs without using aggression to achieve them.

More like there has always been a warlord with an army that has monopoly on services (security, schools, roads...)


Usually what happens is a state is created with a very small government (usually just an army, police and a couple of laws). Then the free market starts doing its magic and people become wealthier because they can exchange stuff, work, ideas through negotiation not violence (regulation).
After people become wealthy government gets greedy and tries to get the muney. Then they get control of schools and media (for propaganda) and start creating laws for the "good of the many". Of course government (monopoly on power) is unsustainable so it always collapses and the same thing happens again.


Government is the definition of monopolies. It's is impossible for a company to get monopoly on a service, product in a free society or if it's possible (like if they own all oil sources on the planet) it's extremely difficult and expensive. Negotiation and trade is by far cheaper and easier. 


Ok are you talking about government or capitalism? I'm confused.

How can you demonize something that is already evil?
@_date: 2014-05-25 17:51:45
That's great! Come for a debate! You know where I don't have to plug the subbreddit :D
@_date: 2014-10-27 05:45:45
So you don't think that government is evil. Violence is virtue! Theft is a good!
@_date: 2014-03-31 17:42:47
The magical fairytale government will prevent that because reasons.
Don't you see, they thought of everything!
@_date: 2014-07-17 18:30:05
Nice try sociopath!
@_date: 2014-10-21 17:04:13
Many??? Private schools still teach about government. But a kid would never in a million years hear about anarchy or philosophical anarchism. Even the simple definition of anarchy ("no rulers") is changed (to "chaos").

They would't need guns if they were trying to debate or help.

Shortly after central banking there were two world wars + later cold war + later war on terror. That's for only 100 years!

Ha have you even worked at an IT company. Watching porn for 8 hours in office is only possible if you are a politician. Anywhere else you will get fired mainly because you don't do any work.
The point was that being a politician is not a job. 
@_date: 2014-05-25 17:46:31
You have to check what is the definition of government. I will save you the time. It is a monopoly on force. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 10:12:55
Thanks! Very helpful!

Really! You are dismissing the whole video because of that. Stop avoiding the real issue!

Lobbying is a natural consequence of government power. In Europe it's called corruption. And the EU corruption is enormous.

Same here. /rest of the world

A quick quiz. Who said that:
"We are gonna give you security and other benefits as long as you give us half of your profits. Or else...."
Government or the Mafia?

Why would you send your friends and partners to a jail you control?
@_date: 2015-02-05 00:43:03
So where's the victim? By that logic a lot of people should go in jail for life for selling you know...weapons.

Focus on cartels in Mexico and store your money in banks in the us.

Have you ever bought a knife? Cause that's a weapon.
@_date: 2015-02-05 00:58:02
Don't forget terrorism. Great results in the past decade
@_date: 2015-02-05 13:52:35
Whose talking about differences. It's the principle. Is knife a weapon?
