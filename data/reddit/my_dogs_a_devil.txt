Fine but if you're talking about "little bits of cash" then in the context of a larger portfolio it is "a little risk". I'm not advocating riding your entire retirement on it but peppering a bit in as a moonshot is fine in my opinion.

If you've been holding pretty much any crypto for a couple months now you've most likely made a lifetime of gains on it by now. Exposing yourself to a little risk doesn't mean you're financially illiterate.

The exchange isn't receiving a local currency that people are "running away from". They're receiving USD. I would imagine the issue is more that people don't want to keep their USD in bank accounts or in hard cash for fear the banks could collapse or army could confiscate it. They can't easily get money our of the country so they'd rather keep it in bitcoin. The exchange on the other hand likely has some way of getting the USD out of the country.

Ironic though that your proof that it's not is to post a fraud site that accepts bitcoin as payment, lol.

I don't think he even realizes it's a third party lol. And yet it says right there "Canadian Passport application assistance... Government fee not included"

In terms of an economy and getting people to spend money (I.e. actually making bitcoin a functional alternative to currency), that's not a good thing at all. Deflation is terrible for an economy.

All modern economies are built around consumption. How am I supposed to start a business if no one wants to buy stuff from it for fear of losing purchasing power? Sure it's good for savers, but all that means is that the rich people who can afford to save get even richer and those living paycheck to paycheck miss out on all the gains.

Simply put it slows down an economy. People aren't going to go out spending money on luxuries, buying better cars, going on vacation, etc. if they think they can wait a week or a month and get 10% more value. They're going to live as frugally as possible. On a wide scale this can have a crippling effect especially on industries that thrive on non-essential services (tourism, luxury goods, etc.) Whether you believe this is good or bad is a matter of opinion but I do think it has large consequences that many people don't consider.

Not true. The reason the ETFs are being brought up is specifically because bitcoin derivatives (I.e. Futures) have been approved for sale, and will likely be the basis of the ETF.

FYI there's actually already a bitcoin trust (GBTC) that supports tax advantaged accounts. The difference is that the the ETF shares can be traded on a public market whereas trust shares have to be bought or redeemed with the trust itself, and also the ETFs are likely going to use futures to replicate bitcoin performance instead of actually buying/selling bitcoin itself.

Lmao I hope you didn't already pay this site. That site is not the "Canadian Passport Office".

That might be your opinion, in my opinion having access to cheap credit and being able to invest in ideas is what allows us to achieve technological advancement and human growth. If you can only borrow at a rate of 100% because that's how much the currency is going to go up, then you can only invest in the safest ideas that have a guaranteed profit, and not take as many chances on things that may or may not end up being fruitless.

I'm specifically referring to the second point in the link you posted, and quite frankly I don't think either of those two examples are good examples to negate the concern. The Swiss dinar may have appreciated and still allowed consumption, but I doubt it was appreciating at 400% a year. And I'm aware bitcoin can't continue that rate of appreciation forever, only saying that that kind of hyper deflation definitely isn't "good" as OP is stating. And as for the computer example I think it's clear people still have a need to purchase whatever tech is available at the time and can't delay consumption forever.
