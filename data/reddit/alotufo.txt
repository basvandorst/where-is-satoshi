I have done most of those things listed here to get the A+ rating from SSL Labs, but I will check the others.  Thanks.
@_date: 2015-12-05 19:05:05
Great. I think it's important not only to have SSL for everyone as Let's Encrypt is trying to do, but to also understand how to do it properly.

Some people send dust transactions begging for bitcoin or spamming their website with messages.

Bitcoin mining secures the network and validates bitcoin transactions. A mining reward is given to miners who successfully solve blocks on the blockchain.

That seems like a really large donation.  I hope it wasn't a mistake.  Regardless, keep up the good work.
@_date: 2015-12-05 15:21:52
That was my understanding as well. I'll be doing some testing with Let's Encrypt soon and wanted to be sure I was doing everything I could to make it as secure as possible. Thanks.

Grade: C on SSL Labs test:
I get an A+ rating on my site with a Comodo DV certificate. Is there something that can be done better with the configuration on your server, or are these problems inherent with Let's Encrypt? I'd like to start using Let's Encrypt as well.

Isn't a Bit worth 0.000001 BTC?

You listed your site URL four times in this post, and three of the four times it was linked and spelt incorrectly.  Please fix.

A fin is 5 bucks, so a Finney should be 5 Satoshis.
@_date: 2014-02-12 05:21:22
I wouldn't call ~3600 BTC/day with a total of 12 million+ coins already out there "flooding the market".  That's not a lot of pressure at all.  0.03% total volume increase a day, and when the reward halves while total volume increases, this will be even less significant.  Since these 3600 BTC are spread out to a lot of miners out there, it means there are even less hitting the market every day.  Therefore, there is very little pressure to drive the price down from miners selling, and as more miners come on board, there is even less pressure going forward.

I think you misinterpreted my comment, but it doesn't matter.
If your goal is to get coins without any history, make that known on your website.
@_date: 2015-08-09 22:50:53
Why would anyone risk mining to your address for an extra 0.2%?
Here's a deal I have for you.  Send me BTC to my address and I'll send you back the amount + 0.2%.  What you are saying is the same  thing.
@_date: 2015-08-01 01:38:37
blockchain.info is wrong (again).

If it sounds too good to be true, it probably isn't.

That's fine.  Nothing wrong with wanting untainted coins, but your request looks like every other scam out there is what I'm saying.  You're basing this on trust with a trustless system.
@_date: 2015-08-09 22:31:46
What you are saying is that you want other people to mine to a bitcoin address that YOU control, in exchange for a PROMISE to pay them more than what they mined at a LATER date.  How can anyone NOT see that as a scam?
@_date: 2015-08-12 01:43:14
About 0.013 BTC.

uBlock works on BitcoinWisdom.

If you have uBlock Origin enabled, this will happen.  Disable it for circle.com

Exactly.  The caption under Peter Smith's name reads 'Blockchain CEO' where it should read 'Blockchain.info CEO'. A big difference.

If you don't plan on running the bitcoin node anymore, save the wallet.dat file which is a small file and contains the private keys to the addresses in the wallet, then you can safely delete the rest.  If you want to find out if the wallet contains any bitcoins, you would have to obtain the wallet address by running the client, and then either let it finish syncing or verify the balance on an online blockchain explorer.

Check to see that you are not setting a maximum number of connections in your bitcoin.conf file (e.g.: maxconnections=5)
If you have 5 connections made already, the website will return the unreachable error.

Turns out it was blockchain.info and a problem with random number generation.  My address is the 1DH address.

This is a third party generated list and not one that can be used to accurately judge where people are in the pre-order line.

This has been difficult as BFL have been denying refunds.

Or just create a new wallet address for each unit, mine with that address, then when finished "testing", print it out as a paper wallet and include it in the box with the order, proving that the unit worked and mined x bitcoins.

Since this was a CSRF attack, I wanted to ask if anyone has had a similar occurrence as I did, except this was from blockchain.info.  I only had 0.11 BTC taken so it wasn't a big deal, but I can see that the same address has received coins from others as well.  I was probably logged into my Bitcoin wallet at blockchain.info at the time as well.
Has this happened to anyone else?
@_date: 2013-07-08 16:45:00
It also doesn't take into account upgraded or canceled orders.  Not everyone would have posted their order either so there are many ways that this list could be inaccurate.
