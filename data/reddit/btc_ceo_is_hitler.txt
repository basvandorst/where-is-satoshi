..of course not; at least not towards *that* god.
Though, there are (or might be) many gods, but let's say any one of them is proven to exist which btw. would make one atheistic towards the other gods. Also the proven god *himself* would have the same problem we have; he'd have to prove that he is the only god and so he'd perhaps find himself an atheist also. What is the rational manner for us and even a god to deal with this?
None of this changes what I said above. Science and logic towards dealing with unknowns would still be the same – and yes, the god(??) we found would have to deal with this in a rational or nonrational (imagine a god that himself is religious!) manner also.
(..i'm not a native English speaker, but i hope you see that i'm hinting towards the error in the question itself..)

Not gonna happen. Mods here don't like to see the truth about anything.
edit: I can see my own comment points. I'd like to report that my comment here currently has +8 points. Yay! Let's fix @_date: 2015-12-09 14:35:19
Yes, a big mistake of many "intellectuals" (???) is thinking value is anything but subjective.
This doesn't change the fact that Bitcoin need some value (subjective, yes) to work or more importantly be useful at all. E.g. for liquidity reasons and also security reasons (incentive for hashing power).

Better buy some of those Blockchain shares.

Next step is negative interest rates (where this isn't already the case).
@_date: 2015-12-09 06:54:52


Uhm, science and atheism deals with unknown variables just fine and in rational manners; very unlike religion. Science also changes and revises itself constantly; something which cannot be said about religion. It is quite an error to say that atheism is similar to or just another religion.
...whatever; don't really care about this guy until he signs something using Satoshi's PGP keys or Bitcoin address; tho he'd probably never do this regardless.
edit: I'll also add that this text has a couple of typos, and overall the "tone" is not like Satoshi at all.

You're a piece of shit as far as I'm concerned.
..I don't support core or XT; I only support decentralization, so to say, and openness of discussion and I think dangerously clueless people like you are the biggest threat to that.
Oh, and by the way? You WILL lose and you WILL end up totally irrelevant and no one will have anything to do with you ever again once this is over which is pretty soon now. You'd better hold on to those BTC you've stolen. PS: You're a loser. 
@_date: 2016-01-12 16:29:13
Yeah, and best thing about using Bitcoin instead of fiat to short legacy markets is that profits will be in Bitcoin also. I.e. the exchange you're using will need to buy Bitcoin in order to pay you your profits which in turn drives the price of Bitcoin up. Winning while winning.
IMHO this kind of thing (speculation) is one of the best killer apps for Bitcoin and it's here already.

On [1broker]( ..they've been around since 2012 and they are solid.
You only need an email to sign up. No papers, documents or other bullshit needed. Just an email then it's Bitcoin in and Bitcoin out. Pretty nice. Just don't use too much leverage (aka. greeed!) and you'll be fine.

Correction: Ez spending money that's rightfully yours anyway.

Yeah, I been around since 2011 and want this guy gone. Never seen such a disasterous handling of things. Infuriating.
@_date: 2015-11-03 00:30:46


It seems sad to just give in like this..

Bitcoin wouldn't be able to do this if it wasn't scarce. Divisibility is STILL not the same thing as scarcity. 
This is also why you can't use your printer to print out USD paper money and think you can get away with this – because without at least SOME scarcity for the USD it would never work as a medium of exchange.
@_date: 2015-11-21 12:46:24
People like this always float towards the "top".
@_date: 2015-11-02 21:50:03
I think that's a terrible way to go about this. No one owns the "Bitcoin" name. There must be a way to deal with rogue mods. I mean surely if someone hijacked, say, many years ago and started trollmodding it today the Reddit owners would do something about it...?
At this point even no mods would be better that what we have now. The Reddit algothims would do a much better job on their own. In a way this is why Bitcoin was invented in the first place; it was done to replace stupid, greedy, flawed humans with an algorithm.
@_date: 2015-11-02 18:44:10
Yes, this is all terrible. It's the most depressing and disappointing thing that has happened to Bitcoin since MtGox in my opinion.
FWIW I'm a long term holder since the beginnings and I used to be very active on this sub with another account, but I won't participate in when things are like this. It's a joke and it's embarrassing to see the mods here weasel around with their language and "decisions".
@_date: 2015-11-03 01:27:49
Where are the admins? Do they have a sub where these things can be discussed?
@_date: 2015-11-16 05:34:14
Yeah, feel free to help out and make Bitcoin more fungible right now: 
@_date: 2015-11-18 12:12:19
1. Not really a miner (buying the BTC needed for dev and testing purposes is way cheaper).
2. Not really a "dev kit" (because it's way too expensive for that considering what's out there).
..so it's the worst of both worlds.
@_date: 2015-11-02 22:09:52
You seem very stupid.
@_date: 2015-11-14 14:50:17
SILENCE!!! Respect da authorethy!
@_date: 2015-11-02 22:19:51


Exactly, so the current mods do not own "Bitcoin". It's a global, decentralized public ledger, but they have claimed ownership of "Bitcoin" here on Reddit. 
In the case where "Microsoft" was claimed; they where in the wrong because they did not own the name. In the case where "Bitcoin" was claimed; they where in the wrong because they did not own the name.
I don't think this reflects well on Reddit in general. Just because "Bitcoin" is a *public* thing it can be treated as shit by a bunch of 20 year old something kids who happened to hijack the name early on?  It's a terrible thing and does not look good for Reddit at all.
@_date: 2015-11-21 12:45:03
I honestly hope it happens. Then all business will move to EU, Africa and/or Asia. Their exports to US will be [crippled toys]( while the rest of the world continues forward.
@_date: 2015-11-26 10:16:15
You can "realize" this without this overpriced product. It's horseshit; they are selling some sort of dream for people who are asleep; no one with half a brain falls for this.
@_date: 2015-11-26 18:28:56
Actually, it must have some value or it won't work as a medium of exchange etc. at all. 
@_date: 2015-10-28 22:04:40
Step 3. Profit
(..for a select few..)
@_date: 2015-11-01 00:58:33


Sounds fine by me; stupid people are assholes anyway.
