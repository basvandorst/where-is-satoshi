Gold is dead, it was a good asset before. But it will turn into the next copper, transporting energy is the only thing metals are used for. Using them as a regular iron would be a waste.
The gold standard died in Nixon's days, it was strong because all of the countries in the free world were supporting gold because the barrel of oil was valued in gold. after that dissapeared and the petro-dollars were starting to comeup and fill wallstreet, because now is valued in US dollars, gold only survived  because the market had conditions, it was "cheap", new, and everybody wanted gold, because before that, nobody could have that much gold. After a few years that the gold to oil dissapeard and the dollar to oil was started to be used, the price of gold rised because of a simple game of supply and demand. 
Now is useless, the recesion is present and even with no recesion, people are not as dumb as before now (maybe, i hope). The new "gold" are stocks and industry and assets that are actually valuable. 
 
Bitcoins are a joke as well, it has no real backup. The only way posible that bitcoin could be staying on float, is that it's being backed up by the black market, and that it has those trillions of dollars/euro/yen,etc.. that are hiding under the bed, trying to come out. 
Either way, bitcoin is more real than gold now.
So unless you are the dragon of the Hobbit (the film trilogy), you should be selling your gold, or just waite for the rise up, but dont expect too much, just a couple of cents, maybe if you are lucky a dollar orndollar and a half in the best of the situations.
