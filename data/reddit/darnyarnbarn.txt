Never, just shitcoin popping
@_date: 2019-07-03 23:42:22
many shitcoins go 100x even more, they just have really small investor pools at that period
@_date: 2019-07-03 21:42:52
lol I seen at least 100x in the period of a few days, if not one day

But how much are we going up per year?
@_date: 2019-03-12 14:45:54
Pretty sure the US is against what is going on right now in Venezuela. 
Even Trump is against it, that shows you how bad it is.

If the effort involved would pay off, people wouldn't be spending energy to literally throw the money out.
If the effort involved would pay off people wouldn't be standing in lines to fish through dumpsters. (they were doing this months ago, and the situation has only gotten worse)
If the effort involved would pay off people wouldn't be farming gold on video games to sell to players of other nations. They would be picking free money up off the street. 
I don't know how old you are or what your life experiences are, but I can guarantee you picking that money up would be a complete waste of time even for a Venezuelan beggar.
What do you think you could buy with that?
@_date: 2019-03-12 15:07:57
It's worse than that.

To be fair you could probably bribe your way out of anything given the inflation there.

Of course trillion or quadrillion would be a thing without banks.
The burden of proof is on you, how would there not be?
You can't answer that because you're wrong, unless of course if you further specify and put further conditions on your argument. Your original statement is just flat out wrong.
Numbers are a thing without banks, period. All numbers existed when the concept of numbers was created.

Wow! Thanks!

Yeah, but not anymore. This isn't making the assertion that paper money was never backed by gold, it was making the assertion that it is not backed by gold.
I think more people still think it's backed by gold than you might think.

But it isn't safe to say that they are all scams, or even intended to be scams.
There are some genuine projects out there.

Make a long enough timeline and every inflationary currency is a scam.
Value is what you're after, and people inherently see value in different things. There are many deflationary cryptocurrencies which aim to tackle different problems.
It is in Bitcoin's nature that it can't accomplish everything. It does a good enough job at what it needs to right now, but it certainly can't do everything a tokenized asset could do... and it doesn't claim to either. 
Maybe one day the Bitcoin tx fee will be considered ridiculous, and someone may aim to make a faster, less costly alternative. Someone may call Bitcoin a scam; eventually once it's all mined out, it rewards the nodes with transaction fees. It's the classic case of the few taking from the many all over again. Technology changes quickly, I think by saying everything besides bitcoin is a scam you limit yourself to a certain point of history where bitcoin was certainly the most relevant, but not even the only legitimate project out there. Undoubtedly in the future new tech will arise, or may be rising right now. New things happen all the time, and could be happening without your knowledge. It would be stupid to say that everything besides Bitcoin is a scam when you don't even know the totality of everything. 
This is for examples sake: 
I think everything except food shelter and water is a scam because anything besides those things doesn't directly translate into survival. The more gates you have to pass through to sustain yourself the further you are away from direct survival, the less 'liquid' your assets are. Even though those efforts may have a higher exchange rate at this time compared to the direct energy to sustenance relationship. If the Grocery stores shut down, where are you going to spend your money? If the internet dies, how will you spend your bitcoin? The surest way to maintain survival is by accomplishing everything you need to on your own. 
Of course none of us do that, I'm just trying to make the example that if you move your goalposts to ideal or extreme lengths you can really make all sorts of bizarre claims. The one you chose to make is that bitcoin is the only non-scam crypto out there. You don't even know all the cryptos or what they are about, you also can't predict the future.
What would it take for a crypto to be considered not a scam in your eyes, and why do you think that is impossible?

So close with the Turing one, didn't expect middle name to be a thing!
