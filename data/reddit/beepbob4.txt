You pay taxes on crypto gains and this is all it needs to win against such practices in court. They simply cannot do this anymore.

Split your sum and invest the first half slowly within 30 days and eventually buy in with the rest at mid January or whenever you're feeling comfortable. Put your limit orders a bit above the last low price in the last 24 hours.  I'm waiting myself for a consolidation of 15 to 20% of the current rallye. But nobody knows what's coming up.
Or put double the amount you want to invest at risk and start with a lump sum and DCA in with the second part on good opportunities. (And take out the lump sum again when it reaches a point above where you have a small plus including taxes)
*Rdy to get smashed by better strats*

The governments already accepted your right to own crypto by taxing them. They cannot reverse this imho. But it's officially an asset not a currency.

A large sell order (or grouped orders) set a specific price which stands tall in a graphic displaying the order book.

I'm glad it worked out for you, now get your bills paid and hodl 20% again for a few years more :)

Delta is not a wallet but a portfolio app like blockfolio

Here in Germany you need to hold for one year. Trades are taxed fifo with regular income tax (&lt;12montgs). Do not be afraid, there will be taxes somehow, and regulations to ramps like Coinbase but it will stay. They cannot ban it anymore, at least not here in the EU.

Look here:  I can understand your anxiety in such a situation. But keep in mind, that the network is slow. If your wallet shows the coins and you can send them, it should only be a matter of time.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:04:28
I'm not your friend, pal. ;) Your transfer showed up as expected, so what's the deal? Send all, be happy and read the docs later about what was your problem today.

You're hanging the wrong goat here ... really. The order book was populated by traders trying to get a fine premium off their free bcash shitcoins. Post only = first order sets the middle. Same with EUR and USD pairs...
Gdax fucked up by not setting a small order first at normal market price before opening the book.

So, I don't know Bitcoin at all, BUT I read earlier today in a Ledger Wallet thread, that to send btc you have to send out the rest in the wallet as "change", maybe this is what happens and you just don't know how to Bitcoin?! Edit: and your wallet manages this for you already and correctly.

It is no hack to create a small interface to import unsupported gateways. No full accountant will get this to work for you, you need to pay a programmer a few bucks or satoshis to create this for you (and maybe you can sell this knowledge later on). 
Sorry, but imo  your answers lack creativity.

Seems like I wasted my time in this thread.
There are many possibilities to get this easily done, but it won't be spoon-feeding.

Without going into many details, I think anybody having any knowledge in VBA/API can build you a full accounting Excel spreadsheet in a few hours. Then export the sheet daily with fiat values to your accounting software and you're good to go.
Why not use bitcoin.tax to export to your accounting software?

Italy and taxes. That just a bit more realistic than Greece and taxes. Thanks for making me smile today.

WTF? The German hyper inflation started with not being able to pay the reparations for losing WW1.

And when it's not a business (like a barber shop) accepting it.

No, it's buying.

No, usually the guy putting up the sell wall is going to scoop up things (well) below his wall and when it's done he pulls the wall.

I'm glad free crypto came first.
@_date: 2018-02-21 19:35:03
Well said and just wrong in every single point. ;) 
@_date: 2018-02-21 20:32:56
Everything. Really, I'm sorry but I am not in the mood to guide you right now. Google your assumptions.

There are definitely some that should be imprisoned for life.

You have to let the volatility flow through you. Then it's perfectly reasonable.

Bad Bitcoin and monero, said the news anchor :D
