Yeah, I get the functionality part. But, I'm a little worried about the prices part. A lot of people have put their life savings in crypto. 
But what Vitalik says influences the price. Remember his death stare?

It's always a good time to buy BTC.

Utterly stupid thought. These guys plagiarise Whitepapers.

Wow. What the feature!

Nothing apart from renaming?

Anonymity was a good thing. Because, if Satoshi Nakamoto would have been arrested by authorities for all the Silk Route and stuff, that would make people fearful about using it.

The winklevosses are the real HODL'ers.

But a probable situation here can that of collusion between a set of miners(offering lower transaction fee for relatively for faster transactions) and users making them richer and richer. 
There is always going to be some level of centralisation in a decentralised mechanism. There is no escaping that. Even, Satoshi knew that. 
ASIC Ressistance is not really effective because parties will find a way mitigate that because it will be a money minting machine for them once they crack it.

Hey, Thanks. Would be great if you give us 50 claps and yes, don't forget to share it with 5 Nocoiners.
@_date: 2018-07-16 20:39:08
A Nocoiner is someone who does not believe in cryptocurrencies and therefore doesn't own any, in this case. That's what we are aiming to show via this article.
