tested on some dummy wallets, takes max of 1.06 seconds and returns one balance with corresponding public address and private key

I have a script that finds all combinations but reports only private keys that have actually have a balance (including balances of 0) in case for some reason you are trying to track down worthless keys lol

That's not what market cap is....
It doesn't represent money in circulation, it is an instantaneous estimate of a market/company's "size" in terms of some currency that then allows you to compare the market value of one asset/asset group to another. When the price of the asset changes so does market cap.
On it's own, the current market cap of bitcoin has no predictive power, so it doesn't indicate the possibility of a bitcoin rise. It does reflect a drop or rise in the price or supply of bitcoin.
Your gold/btc example is the exact purpose of market cap: The current total value of all circulating bitcoin is $X, for gold it is $Y, because Y&gt;X, the gold market currently holds more "value"
There is no harm in making that comparison... and there is no harm in waving a towel and shouting about the moon and btcs market cap.
I think you should read up on market cap, or avoid making decisions/judgements based on it.

Yes but what is the harm in assigning a (technically accurate) value to the btc market? Anyone who will actually use that number to make decisions already knows how to use it. The posts you're talking about are the same as every dumb gif or "10k fuck yeaaaah!" You're correcting something that 1) doesn't need to be corrected and 2) isn't actually incorrect.

Your econ 101 only covered perfectly competitive markets then?

That's not really how market cap is/should be used. It's main purpose is asset comparison because stock prices don't tell you anything unless everyone has the same amount of outstanding shares.
It's perfectly fine to compare the btc market cap to another company. And it technically does represent the asset's current value: "the current market value of all outstanding bitcoin is $X"
It's a simple measure that does what it's supposed to. But its mostly just used for clickbaity headlines these days
