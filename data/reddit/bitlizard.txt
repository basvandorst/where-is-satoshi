they are demanding that the government address economic inequalities (a completely absurd proposition). So its pretty safe to assume that as a group they have a complete lack of understanding in terms of; economics, politics, philosophy.

Most bitcoin users (IMHO) have rejected the kind of keynesian economic principals you have based your argument on in favor of more commen sense based Austrian / free market ideas. Politicians and government contractors much prefer Keynesian economics though as it provides justification for the debasement of currencies to enable the buying of votes and funding of massive state projects. That is why it is taught in college and university.

Joe Rogan frequently talks about the following on his podcast; government corruption, military industrial complex, corporate greed and scumbaggery, marijuana legalization, big brother, science and technology, ancient aliens, porn, stand-up comedy and much more. bitcoin would probably be right up his alley.

Bitcoin has one huge and obvious quality that mintchip and just about all other digital currencies lack. Allow me to state the obvious 'bitcoin is not centrally issued and controlled'. If the bitcoin experiment succeeds, it will be a deflationary currency. This is a very big deal with enormous social and economic implications. Lets not make an apples to apples comparison between mintchip and bitcoin. mintchip is nothing more than an extension of the centrally controlled worthless fiat currency that has been used to enslave humanity for a very long time. Bitcoin is something much greater. 
@_date: 2012-04-09 19:01:42
I don't see mintchip as competition to bitcoin. bitcoin is global, open source and the nature of its design has and continues to incentive IT people on monetary and social levels to voluntarily participate in the development of the network. Does mintchip of have such qualities?

IMHO at this point it is easier to make a case for bitcoin as a pure investment for capital gains than for existing businesses to integrate. Rational; bitcoin as an investment is moderate risk insanely high return. This can be easily demonstrated with basic math. Secondly large businesses considering bitcoin will probably look first to the market cap of bitcoin, presently it is only $80M but as more investment capital flows into bitcoin the market cap will grow and so will the interest of prospective businesses. That being said if anyone can persuade a business to accept bitcoin, they are doing a real service.

Good answer.

i think they might be taking a run at bitcoin, looks like they are trying to incorporate some the the key bitcoin characteristics. 
"The Royal Canadian Mint, for example, is exploring how to issue digital currency in the future. Its chief financial officer Marc Brule said Bitcoin's biggest problem was that it is not backed by anything.
"The system we would bring in would be backed by a fund," he told Reuters. "Bitcoin may work for the small group of people that believe in its value, but that could change very suddenly."
Without that backing or a similar power base, Bitcoin lives with the ever-present risk of failure.

bitcoin is dying for its one killer app that will broaden its appeal placing it squarely in the mainstream consciousness. Whether it be a big player like google, apple, or facebook integrating bitcoin into their business models (not gonna happen), a really well executed porn site or porn site business model that actually makes money (could happen), an awesome music download site or filesharing site, a complete A - Z solution for international remittances. Eventually something is going to come along that has very strong appeal to people outside the bitcoin community and then we are going to grow the biggest bubble that cryptographic currency has ever seen. The potential is there without a doubt.

Some fun math for the OP. please feel free to correct if I misstate anything. 50 btc are created every 10 minutes. That's 7200 per day. That's about $54,000 USD flowing into the btc ecosystem per day. I know some miners hold their newly minted coins, but still the value exists and should be included in equation. In the fall the production of btc will get halved. The prices keep going up because bitcoin is attracting more and more capital. It's basic supply and demand. 
@_date: 2012-08-25 03:50:39

we could prevent the exchanges from shorting (selling btc they do not have unbeknownst to the other party) by auditing them somehow. We should for a number of reasons; 1) its tantamount to fraud on a massive scale, 2) a large scale theft of value from the btc network will reflect very badly on the btc network. IMO in the future it will become very apparent that bitcoin and the value of its market capitalization are purely a function of reputation. I.E. bitcoin's market cap is proportionate to bitcoin's usership. And bitcoins usership is reputation dependent. BTC exchanges are the single point of entry for many users both present and future. The integrity and security of the network as a whole should be the highest prerogative of the network. Exchanges are a vital part of that network and must be kept honest.

"As coins move from you guys (geeks, anti-establishment types, crypto-enthusiasts) to those with money (the 1%, hedge fund managers, elite banking dynasties), power remains in the hands of those who held it under the old system, and away from those who really truly believed in change and dismantling the current system early on."
 The power they hold now is a function of their proximity to the printing presses, which are rendered obsolete as people opt for bitcoin over paper.

The bitcoin ATM is actually a very clever idea. Unlike a typical ATM,  a bitcoin ATM could possibly manage its own cash reserves by simply adjusting exchange rates to make cash to bitcoin transactions fee free when required. The machine could automatically send a tweet offering waived fees whenever it required cash. Doing the opposite when it needed to unload cash. This could make the machine very cost efficient.

"Has there been any evidence of a Mt Gox customer's BTC balance being unavailable for transfer?" I don't know, but the absence of such evidence does not preclude the possibility of market manipulation described by the OP. The only way to ensure honesty is for all users to store their bitcoins off exchange. In fact now that I think about it, any third party website that allows users to store BTC balances could be 'shorting' bitcoin.

" the bitcoin ledger is distributed. Hundreds of thousands of independent nodes all over the world store its data and work in a coordinated fashion to regularly update it. Bitcoin technology is fast and efficient. A user can instantaneously sell their spot in the ledger to someone on the other side of the world and, thanks to the architecture of the system, all parties to a transaction can be pretty sure that the spot being transferred isn't a fake or a counterfeit. Neat stuff, and people want to be part of it." Hmmm I wonder if a globally distributed ledger secured by the worlds most powerful computing network could be useful at all, or be worth anything???

"Fortunately, bitcoin allows a method to prove they own coins to sell. Ask them to send you a message encrypted with their private key, and their public address. If the message can be decoded with their address, they have proved they own the account, and you can check the balance and transaction history. Of course, they won't be able to do this, because it's a scam, but in general bitcoin allows you to check up on sellers, and this is a very useful feature." That's great info.

no charge backs, no need for customer to share personal info, supports micro payments, easily converted to USD or whatever currency you want. very little competition in the market space, no third party payment processor to gouge with excessive fees and or freeze account funds, sooner or later someone is going to figure out how to get 1,000,000 people to pay 0.001 BTC to see a naked lady. they will generate $70k in the process.
