If we've held BTC prior to the Aug 1 fork, what other forks are worth a shit besides BTG and BCH? I've only claimed BCH
@_date: 2018-01-19 19:12:46
Just curious why you go ACH vs wire?
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:59:44
Yep, this

Wait til you see a cashier hold up a mBTC to make sure the watermark is there /s

Am I missing anything by not integrating crypto into my wardrobe? Can we see some of your signature pieces, or are we talking diamond chains and the like?

Yea maybe they flipped it for BTC right away but it seems here they aren't accounting for it. And getting in at $24 per, I assume it's quite a hefty sum

God bless this woman and the other people out there doing good with their excess fortunes, especially with the Holidays approaching. Spread the love spread, happy holidays everyone!

And if you're nervous about transferring onto the hardware wallet, start with .01 or smaller. Wipe the device and go through a restore so that you're confident in your ability to do it again if ever needed.

I wake up every morning fully expecting it to be less than when I went to bed

What happened to all the BCH you got from the Aug 1 fork?

This reminds me, while traveling in Missouri for the eclipse yesterday, I came across a chain of small banks called BTC Bank!

Should have went 99% crypto, 1% trees to calm the anxiety

3-5 business days is what it usually has taken (closer to 5 imo), but that was 2+ months ago. Might be longer now with their increasing users

And the plate will read "MYLAMBO"
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:27:31
And that's more like $150K but maybe they aren't converting to USD
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:05:10
Unobtainable? Less than 60 days ago you could have got in for less than $5K. Less than 120 days ago you could have got in for less than $2800. Don't talk about unobtainable just because you *think* you're late to the party...this party never ends!

This is fucking GODL right here I tell ya! Bravo!
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:52:18
Cool shit OP! I'd pay at least .1 for that!

If it's the same size as the original, my fingers are way too fat to be able to effectively hit those small digits on the touch screen

Where's a good place to sell or exchange it for BTC now that Bitfinex (what I used before) isn't available to US customers?
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:08:11
I use Exodus for my daily transactions - no complaints from it. About a month ago one of my exchanges (ETH--&gt;BTC) got hung up and their support was swift and had my issue and coins returned quickly. Other than that I've had no issues.  For long term storage, I'd look into a hardware wallet though as others have said

Anyone familiar with Presearch?
@_date: 2017-07-07 16:36:43
You should. It took about a week for me to get it with the expedited shipping option, and I got it last week
@_date: 2017-06-29 16:16:47
What's this shortcut you speak of?
