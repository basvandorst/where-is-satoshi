Fair point. But had you considered Orange man bad?

Check and mate.

All those float tank sessions he does ....

You're resorting to ad-homenin attacks. His statement says nothing about his character. Maybe he donates 50% of his net worth each year. You've never met the guy. Relax and treat people with respect.

So you're telling me there's a chance?! Awesome!

The situation in Venezuela is total corruption at the state level with regards to its official currency statistics.

Gizmodo is a stupid waste of energy.

Actually a few do have the death penalty for blasphemy. I found "death" listed as a penalty under Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Yemen. 


How would you write that into a law exactly? 
@_date: 2018-11-29 18:20:27
That's what happens when you fork.

It's about the acceleration, not the absolute velocity.

Sounds like you're describing people who produce "hate speech". The problem is who defines what that made up term means and what penalties they put on it. For instance, in some parts of the world it's "hate speech" to criticize Islam and you're put to death if you do.

It is, yes. We could spend an eternity I'm sure debating who and what beliefs need to be opposed. 
I appreciate very much your style of discourse. Have a nice day!

Fact of the day: it's actually a way to test gold. A moderate bite should show some markings.

I think calling them "scum who need to go" would piss them off.

Economics dictates that the fees will lower when supply increases. It's a good thing that they're high right now because it incentives new companies to enter the market, case in point the Coinstar machines that were just added the other day.

What's the point of this satellite network when I can just route a payment around the globe normally?
Edit: answering my own question: 
Seems like overkill to me though?

Would be nice if some wallets implemented something like this.
