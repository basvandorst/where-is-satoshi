Reboot your computer in safe mode, wait a bit and see if those nodes are still sucking your bandwidth. If they aren't anymore, your computer was either mining or downloading the entire database. It should be doing neither.

This is a great idea! Make sure you make some calculations about withdrawal limits, starting balance, etc before you open to the public. Otherwise I promise you will be pumping your forum with your own Bitcoin. I wish you good luck. :)

While I don't know of any, I'd like to stop people before they send you to a tumblr profile page with CSS on it.
For those people, A bitcoin tumbler attempts to sever the links between your old address and a new address by sending coins from you to other people and coins from them to you. It also randomizes transaction amounts and sometimes adds time delays to the transactions. 
It's like a buffer in the mafia. 
@_date: 2015-01-07 19:03:03
Woah no kidding, just imagine if you could buy these with bitcoins. If I was up in microsoft I'd run a "Fund your phone using only bitcoin" campaign.

What he is trying to say is that after you die, your bitcoins stay in your wallet. With none to gain access to them.
I suppose the only thing this does is increase BTCs value over time. If Bitcoins became used for generations, then we would be using bitcoin fractions just like we do today. Just those fractions would be worth more.
@_date: 2015-01-07 20:08:45
You have a great idea, I'd recommend doing a bit more work on it's presentation before you try to go public. Good luck! :)

I see, I apologize for calling you out as a troll, as there are many trolls living in this realm. While I personally want bitcoin to take off, I also suppose the world wouldn't end if it failed. 
You're right, there WAS an issue with it. But there are just as many issues with regular fiat as well, if not more. This issue was a tiny blimp in the many years of bitcoin, while most issues with regular currency have existed for far too long. Use what you like :)
@_date: 2015-01-05 19:18:57
I see, that makes a lot of sense! Thanks!

To have investment in only one currency would be crazy. If you want to be safe from economy issues, you need to have some of every currency.
Also, USD in a bank isn't "crazy" as long as you have plenty to live off of stored safely at home. Why skip the advantages of a bank? :)

Don't understand why people just downvote stuff. Reasonable posts here had higher upvotes last time I checked. If you're gonna downvote, at least leave a reply that's worth something.

The best part about price rising is everyone rushes to buy even more making the value rise even higher faster

Your receiving wallet needs to rescan the blockchain, it's there. I promise.

Not sure why you were downvoted. You're absolutely right. While its true there may be a scam, DidHeJusts point 1 is a very high possibility. Stuff like that happens all the time in small businesses as well as large ones.

Doesn't matter how much money you have, you can still own minor fractions of bitcoin. However if you are financially struggling, I'd focus on getting a bit more stable before putting money into bitcoins.

I see, so you just want to make a bitcoin tool that we'd find useful?
Make a BTC wallet that can send bitcoins on user set repeat. Ex "Send bitcoins to -address- every -number- days"
@_date: 2015-01-07 15:45:23
Just curious, how does using something like this appear in legal terms?

I'm well aware that 13 cents isn't going to assist him. If I wanted to fully support him, I would've sent him $200. Changetip is designed for showing your appreciation. The amount of bits I send; I see as more of a rating than a reward or donation.

There's a strange amount of bitcoin hate weather today isn't there? It's never really hurt much I suppose. Forecast says it should blow over.
@_date: 2015-01-07 16:46:22
I'm not defending him by ANY means.  
I'm sure most of us are capitalists, so he says he believes in a real market, where you work for your pay. And you then pay for work. Nothing wrong with that at all, I believe in it as well. "money for the people" sounds like the stupid Obama paychecks (funded by us), and that's where you both got mixed up.
@_date: 2015-01-08 21:59:30
I'd also like to point out that bitcoin is falsely accused of so many errors, that it can't make too much ground. We need to do a better job of explaining what it is and how it really works. It's because of the misconceptions that we're called crazy.
@_date: 2015-01-07 01:05:45
Bitcoins are secured by the laws of the universe. The only reason there have been "hacks" and robberies is because of the original owners not taking the required precautions.

They are replacing the users balances with their own earnings. When do you see a company do that? Better than the Gox situation.

1. That is not a lie, there can only be 21 million bitcoins to mine. Right now, there are about 14 million mined, and the last block will be mined after we are dead.
2. That is the risk we love taking, and the smart users stay away from exchanges.
3. Easier than using an online credit card. Faster too. 
4. That's not quite how it works, I suppose you're kinda onto something.
5. The value will simply go up for that.
6. Finally a REAL point. Not one I could argue against.
7. This is the whole idea behind point  We don't have to worry about the government taxing us to pay the lousy citizens who don't work or contribute anything. 
8. Okay??? I could say the same to you..
9. ???? Use what you want buddy.

I once had .28 BTC stuck in the blockchain and this worked for me
