Seriously wtf. In the amount of time it took to post that, google would have given you about 1,000,000 answers... yes

why is using coinbase a bad thing?

The cringe is strong with this one

set up a stop loss order if anything. cashing out now would be foolish

Research and find out for yourself which coins resonate with you the best.

Dollar cost average means basically take whatever your max investment is, cut it in half, and buy that now. Then, keep watching what BTC does, and put the remaining half in when you see a dip, maybe 2-3 weeks later.
Not always how it’s done exactly, but that’s it in a nutshell

What if you lost your job? What if you got in a car accident  and required insanely expensive surgery? Emergency fund? Or are you already THAT loaded?

I wasn’t disagreeing! I can see how it could be construed that way though.

Wow I really didn’t think the /s would be necessary for that...

Look at the housing market. I know that’s apples and oranges, but those bubbles last years. This is an infant of a market and is being redefined constantly. Using historical examples, though, this shows some bubbly signs.

What?? Bitcoin has had a flat growth curve for probably 90% of it's lifespan.
Once from September to December 2013 did it grow from $100 to almost $1000.  For the next year, it showed *some* erratic behavior, but it never broke the ATH set in late November 2013 again until Jan '17. It also maintained a floor that went no lower than  ~$220. 
So it hit one exponential spurt of 10x growth. Nothing like that has happened since then, until this past year of 10x growth from $1000 in January to ~$10k now.
So. Seven years of exponential growth, eh?

That’s some of the strongest evidence FOR a bubble IMO. Erratic, exponential growth is not sustainable for long. Hence bubble.

Wtf, he was actually correct more or less up to 2017. Let’s see if he continues to be correct!

He means sell everything when you freak out at the drastic dip, and panic when it starts to rise again, buying back at the new ATH
