Dude could have bought a car twice as nice if he had waited like 2 days...

I actually much prefer this to the r/Bitcoin vs r/btc crap that we had a while back. Thankfully they finally forked and know r/btc might as well be called r/bch so there isn't much left of that I hope

So we're just going to forget about how jaxx was found to have crappy security and they just kinda said "fuck it"

*costs twice as much in fees and you need to stand in line for 20 minutes waiting for a confirmation*

THIS. Satoshi envisioned Bitcoin as an alternative to fiat currency that is used as, well, currency. Bitcoin was never supposed to be for hoarding/hodling just to be traded back for fiat later. When you exchange fiat for Bitcoin, it should be no different than exchanging CAD/EUR or any other fiat conversion

It isn't all that easy to go directly fiat -&gt; XMR, but you can use pretty much any exchange (even shapeshift) to exchange Bitcoin for Monero. I recommend the "official" gui as it is the most secure, and relatively easy to use.

That's where monero comes in ;)

The USD isn't backed by gold and is used by criminals

I used to use Bitcoin for smallish online transactions, similar to OP, but sadly the huge transaction fees have made transactions worth under like 100 USD unideal. It's honestly pretty sad because it was actually so much easier than using a credit card or PayPal.
