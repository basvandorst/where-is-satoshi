would be nice to know when the limits go up. Do I just have to buy $50 multiple times and wait and see? or is it like 30-60-90 days after a successful buy?

yes, if you happen to live in one of the few places that have them and want to give in to even more verification and then pay 10% above market. Now I see why people actually use Purse.io

I don't know where you got this idea, but maybe you should try a dictionary. Consensus has never meant total agreement by all parties.

to be fair

Even the cancellation isn't so much of an annoyance as one of my orders did get through. It happened to be exactly the same size as the others, which seems strange. What is upsetting is the drastic reduction in my buy limits.

general agreement is not the same as unanimity. Furthermore, I assume you've heard the phrase 'a growing consensus'? meaning more and more people in a group are agreeing? that can't happen when you already have unanimous agreement.

There was a message from Coinbase support here saying this kind of thing was over and that was why they now start out with slowly increasing buy limits. I slowly increased my buy limits just to see them reduced almost all the way back down to the beginning.
