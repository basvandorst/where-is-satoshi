Very cool

They should have the means to roll back the transaction even after the fact, which is my preferred approach to the problem. I realize how hard that might be.

Is it just thought crime? They stole real money from people.

Clearly the whales are buying back Bitcoin, don't be fooled by the ongoing manipulations both up and down.

It's a centralized shitcoin. Sad.

So it looks like it was Hal Finney, too bad he got iced before he could cash in on the deliberate value pumping scheme he created. Anyone thinks he'll be able to return from the ice one day?

Haha good one

Fractional reserve banking is actually sensible as anchoring money on real world IS an excellent idea. However, it's warped beyond belief. What's that ratio now, 5% or less? It's all bullshit don't believe the US/Israel dominated international banking cartel. It's really a plot to enslave mankind and you can see they achieved it since virtual money (derivative markets) is already like 20x real money and uh that's 20x more than whatever fictitious reserves they hold at Central banks.
What do they do with all this virtual money? Oh, stuff like weaponizing money against countries they don't like, and giving trillions of dollars to military companies.

I just read a post that mathematically proved bitcoin will be $100M by 2030. I guess that's a no brainer then, sell your house and get in. :-D

HODL is the cleverest strategy because some secret sources tell me Bitcoin is going to be $1M by 2022.

There is only one supply. The return will be worth the wait.

What do you mean you can't fill my tank with Ethereum GAS????

It's unassailable logic. Every difficulty doubling pumps price. Exponential increase forever. Infinite money. It might be on my profile.

I learnt it from libertarian Bitcoin geniuses like Nick Szabo. Bitcoin is better than gold because it has a fixed supply. Anything that's scarce is automatically super valuable, like my butt.

I'd predicted $10k. It's not easily predictable I guess. ��
