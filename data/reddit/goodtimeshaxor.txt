EDIT: Also the 3-4 different font types...

Any option to force our LBC wallets to provide a new segwit address instead of having to make one last deposit into a non-segwit address?

If the Price on markets goes lower it means someone is selling. If it goes really low it means a lot of people are selling

I use KeepKey with electrum. Are there any guide I can follow to upgrade to a segwit electrum wallet that works with KeepKey?
Or is it as simple as downloading the latest release of Electrum and creating a new wallet using the"hardware wallet" option?

All the upvoters would agree with your statement but not the sarcasm
@_date: 2016-06-11 07:19:26
Your wording here is confusing and misleading

The redditor is glad that Bitcoin is trending upwards again

Can you explain why you say "Rofl"? I'm genuinely interested in why argument is incorrect in your eyes.

Me too. Let's give OP a chance to Google it

Awesome! I am one of those mods that has been enjoying early access to 2FA and have to say that I am enjoying it very much. Thank you for implementing 2FA on Reddit. It's something that the community has been asking for for a long time but I'm glad that it's finally being added.
Remember everyone: Secure your accounts with 2FA (including your Reddit account once 2FA is available to everyone)

RemindMe! 1 year "Took out a $30k loan to buy BTC"
@_date: 2015-11-14 22:51:59
Oh! Didn't know. I'm a complete noob when it comes to reading charts. I'll check it out
@_date: 2015-11-15 00:37:59
What in the fuck? So this is showing that someone bought bitcoins @ 2200?
@_date: 2015-11-14 23:19:04
Right on their website

I usually just look at the trade view on BitStamp
