Crypto 1, Crypto 1, recommend adjusting your fuel mixture to a heavier ether blend to maintain velocity, over.

Anyone else starting to get concerned with the amount of time it's taking?

I like how after almost a decade in a coma, this junkie's first words are to check prices. Diagnosis - coma caused by seizures onset from staring at a screen with flashing red and green lights for too long.

Based on your posts and comments, you seem like a fairly befuddled and confused trader. The reality is, trading isn't for everyone and only a small percentage can do it consistently well. Just because you're part of the large majority who cannot do it consistently well, doesn't mean it's a scam. Perhaps instead of looking outward to find reasons for your failure, you should examine what you could have done differently to be successful. I would venture to guess the exact opposite of whatever you did. In other words, the trader who did the exact opposite of what you did is up over 100k.

Ya but Universal is a term throw around pretty loosely nowadays. Ever notice how Miss Universe ALWAYS comes from Earth? Since it's an obvious fix in a very publicized pageant, people think they can call anything universal...even time in the future. And don't get me started on why my remote control is a lying hypocrite.

Good read, very informative! Thank you!

BTC.com was an easy wallet setup. They are going to give all BCC out to their respective BTC owners but you can't liquidate, only withdraw or hodl.

Looks like BTCPOP is an option
