I just had the same thing happen. Was trying to buy something off HumbleBundle. So I send the btc, but since it doesn't verify the ten minute counter reaches zero, I don't have a game, I lost .025 btc :(
And yes of course I send a fee. Was using blockchain.info

After the recent losses, the kid started betting btc, and has now lost everything.
It's sad and stupid and he deserves a slap, but yeah. No father would rather lose his son than 7000 bucks.

If you buy btc now, you'l get it at the lowest price it's ever going to be. Buying $1 a day will lead to huge regrets when in a couple of months $10.000 will buy what $1 does today. Go all in, many of us have already done so. Down with fiat, bitcoin is the new standard.

Cool, I didn't know that. So there's never an address with more than one outgoing transaction?

Do we really want them in btc though? Btc started as an cryptocurrency for a bunch of techies who wanted a safe anonymous alternative free from market manipulation by the FED and bankers. Remember Satoshi's message on the first block?
And now 90% of btc is daytrading and we're cheering billionaires to please buy btc. It would be nice as a strike against fiat, but fiat being controlled by the Fed is just one problem. The assholes with money in the Cayman Islands are another.
Sorry, I meant: god, aren't the Winklevosses dreamy?

One 'order', maybe a group of people involved with bitcoin friday?

It's not anything apart from something I've as of today made two million $ off.

Congrats! What are you going to do now?
@_date: 2013-11-24 10:15:59
You dump 5000 btc, price goes down, people panic sell. You buy 5000 at the lower price point. You wait while the price corrects upwards. Repeat.

Yes, it's bad for bitcoin as a means of payment. 
BUT, and this is something that I haven't heard mentioned before: its a great way to attract users for now.
Let's all just admit it: most users are in BTC for speculation right now, and have seen massive, massive profits. This has attracted media attention, and this has attracted users. More users means more businesses using bitcoin.
Without the huge volatility of the past few years BTC might have remained a stable currency at $1 or so that's a handy alternative for nerds. Now, we've has attracted millions of people to put some money into BTC, who will attract businesses, and the more people start using BTC as a payment method instead of an investment, the more prices will stabilize. Ending with a much more broadly accepted (and thus *more stable*!) alternative currency than if it would stabalize with a small userbase.
All in all, for now the big volatility is doing BTC more good than harm.

e: jenya_ explained it all :)
Why would exchanges keep sending money to (presumably) themselves? The miner's fees would ratchet up quickly.
I just don't understand what could possibly be the use for this. If I ran an exchange with 35k btc, why would I send it to another address, then another, then another, then another, each time sending the entire amount minus some fees and occasionally (but only occasionally) small payments to other addresses. Why not just send the small payments by themselves?
It only makes me less able to pay, since I have to wait on confirmations every time.

Because you've made multiple wrong predictions already and then said "oh, that was my third most likely prediction, so I'm still right", and basically just act like a jerk.

It's the feds, btc they took from DPR.

You should have given that as a btc-tip to someone with a smart reply in askscience, or someone here whose comments you value, or whatever person that just adds anything of value. This guy has seven posts on reddit, and doesn't even have any investment in bitcoin. His post is literally 'give me money'. 
I don't mean to imply anything bad about you, if you want to give random people money sure go ahead. But it's better for btc to buy something for 10c in a btc-related sub than just give some random slacker money for nothing.

The level of tipping won't, but more people getting interested in BTC and checking it out will. If a top-level comment in r/funny or whatever has a btc-tip, thousands of redditors will see it, hundreds will check it out, and ten will get interested in bitcoin.

I don't doubt you're way better at this stuff than 90% of the people here, but you're still often wrong, and it's dangerous to tell people you know the truth when you don't. A false sense of security is really really dangerous when daytrading, and your posts read to me as if you're selling exactly that to people.
