... yet another argument for backup plan. RIP bitcoin. Sorry OP

Agreed. Still a lot of money. I'm not *happy* about paying $4 fees on send, but when a TX is hundreds of dollars and need money into and exchange to buy my favourite shitcoin, or whatever else I'm doing (and will be making $ profit) it makes sense to me.
What I'm saying is that it makes 0 sense to pay $7 for a TX fee to buy a videogame of equal value. The OP should have purchased the game for bro, and sent him the key or download link or account, or something along those lines.

Sold BCC yesterday @ 0.435 btc / $1195.00 USD
Figured that once Bittrex open BCC/BCH Deposits, DUMP will follow.
Donated some $ from Profit taken to Litecoin Foundation.

FFS STOP paying $5-$7 and higher TX fees on small transactions. You WILL get your TX in 5 blocks with $2-3 max, there is NO NEED to overpay!
I have no idea how you people come up with these transaction fees. I made two payments today [27 August 2017], one 0.00095 because I needed a fast TX = $4.15 and an other one at 0.0005 for = $2.15 both went trough, confirmed right away.

My last BTC Bitcoin TX was 0.0001 / 0.43 cents and it confirmed in 10 min and cleared in 30 minutes. This was earlier today, Sunday [ 27 August 2017 ] Sent another one w low fee, that also confirmed in 10 minutes. $BTC

You're not missing anything: In a SHTF situation you wont be able to sell or buy gold silver or bitcoin. That would be the last thing that matters. But it does provide some value once you are safe and can restart your life in some form.
@_date: 2017-07-27 18:56:56
Trying to give some perspective: For your mental health and well being, you really need to put things into perspective. If the loss of 2BTC / 5K affects you so much, then you should no be trading at all. We all lost BTC over the years, (anyone that has been in this long term) and I'm not going to say how much and where. Mt. Gox and various other exchanges affected anyone that has been trading for awhile... There is always risk when trading and trusting someone else with that value, and not having actual control over that bitcoin / balance.
Yes BTC is awesome and making some $ is also great. But I just want to say that whatever $ number is NOT worth getting so upset over it. I understand that we are socialized &amp; educated to care about money, trust me on this, such agony over $5K is not worth it. You will have way bigger things in life to deal with. 
And even tho its shitty right now, try to appreciate the things that you have, and maybe don't even put a value on right now. There is a small chance they may come back and you and many others will be able to recover the loss. Let see how this turn out over the next two weeks. Take care.
@_date: 2017-07-28 14:04:44
you're welcome. you will be able to use the same private key on the new blockchain, and access the same balance as you have now. so nothing to worry about. now we just wait and see how fast this BCC is going to tank.
@_date: 2017-07-28 12:08:35
You coins are *never* inside the wallet. 
All wallet does is store your private keys to access the balance on chain. 
Don't worry, your "coins" are safe ;]

There is: NMC Namecoin
And it's AWESOME, not really being used for it's potential at this time.

Many people forget that the earlier version of bitcoin code had MANY huge bugs and issues, that showed that Satoshi did not understand all aspects of the code. 
It was guys like Hal Finney that pointed out some of these issues, and they worked together to fix it, and bitcoin hard forked a few times before it became fully functional. 
One of the bugs in the earlier version of bitcoin was that anyone could send / spend coins from any address, if they modified a part of the OP_RETURN code. That got fixed, and so many other *big* bugs got taken out.
The block size limit was set initially as a protection against DDoS attacks. This later became a major issue, with people not really understanding WHY it was put there in the first place. Satoshi himself said that may likely become an problem [2009], and should not be much work to upgrade the value if needed.
It was funny for me to watch all these years, all the political debates pro and against block size limits, when all it was a simple upgrade to do. Satoshi would have done it right away. Any other alt-coin would have implemented and adjusted that overnight, instead, bitcoin supporters decided to go ape shit over it.
All in all. Cool idea tho, if you wanna play pretend like children do ;]

What is most likely is that (a Small Country or State) may issue a smart contract based on BTC / XCP CounterParty, Litecoin / Omni Layer, Ethereum or whatever new network, and then "manage" the balance based on Index price of Crypto Commodity. Like a combined BTC Index or Crypto Index price. BTC and Crypto holdings may act as a "reserve" for the deployed network contracts. OR they could use GDP as direct measure of "market cap". Or a combination of resources &amp; assets, including Land Value, Commercial Real Estate, Economic Output, Physical Assets, Virtual Commodities, ETFs &amp; Crypto.
Managing an "asset" trough a smart contract VM is much easier then dealing straight in BTC. And you could set whatever number of units is needed: 1 billion or 100 million or whatever, and manage that # issued to improve economic factors. To be effective, the exchange of units would also have low transaction fees, enabling for effective exchange of small value, high volume ($5-$3 or less) transactions. As you may have more then 1000 TX / second in peak hours.
The current price, structure and transaction fees in Bitcoin do not allow for nation wide money management system. Instead this could be implemented through a smart contract simple VM and an APP powered by the bitcoin network. Management of the Smart Contract is also needed, and this smart contract could be upgraded or moved to different networks in the future, still keeping the Bitcoin in reserve as an asset value.
USDT / Tether running in the Omni Layer is a current example of how this can be done.

If bitcoin was worth 0.50 cents or 0.05 cents no one would really care. Or whatever fraction of EURO or CHF same thing. IMO the technology and concept that is more important, then the actual value assigned / per unit. Most ppl care about $ price.
