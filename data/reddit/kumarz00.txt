hey may I also point out that given (others have suggested that)this might be an inside job(appreciate that u guys insist it isn't), even though withdrawals will be frozen, there is a small possibility of MITM attacks when users all rush to check their balances(exposing login deets) when the site comes up next: please can you(ask your guys to) take steps to ensure that is made less possible? Otherwise the next attack could clean us all out nice and proper :s

hey would BTC in funding wallets, specifically those that were put up for lending or already being lent, have been susceptible to the theft too? I ask because these BTC shouldn't normally be available for withdrawal: users certainly don't see these as available.
@_date: 2016-04-20 11:20:44
agree, I have seen my BTC sell @ 2.5-3% lower than bitfinex prices when I use the card. Thankfully, no other hidden charges tho

wow, total frat move for a new company: clearly they're cutting corners on things like hiring: way bad sign! ... thX for the post OP, good to know
@_date: 2014-05-12 14:30:51
decent, no pizza tho ... I say OP's one is fittingly kitsch and better

bought a few around 350 in mid oct, will add more to stash when this so-called correction is over around 275-300{or if it tanks even further(!)} BTC currently 15% of my net worth, of which 5% was that mid oct purchase. I've been in the game(buying, selling, trading, futures, options etc.) since BTC around apr2013.
@_date: 2014-05-27 11:39:19
I find Bittylicious more expensive than localbitcoins traders: even the open offers.

"no instrinsic value whatsoever": there really ought to be a shoot to kill order on that childpornbuyin' wanker
@_date: 2014-06-02 19:25:56
yeah and snatching money is probly the biggest "UP YOURS" possible right? :P

lol Matt Miller is such a BTC plug! ... love it though, one of the best things to happen to bitcoiners(non-bitcoiners must be so pissed with his persistence heheh)
@_date: 2014-11-21 16:22:21
yeah mate, I also bought(dumb fuck) what is now 1% of my NW around 1000/BTC, so I've been everywhere!
Of course this pales in significance to what I've been making/losing in derivatives, but for sanity I've been accounting for those outside my "stash". esp. now that even leverage with options is a joke compared to 20x okcoin futures heheh.

massive giveaway, top bitcoiner!
Just to clarify, you'll not be after address info etc. ?

WTF man, tell them to buy the coins while in the US !!! ... in Argy even on the blue dollar its more expensive! Those guys will make a small fortune if they sell their coins when they get to Argentina!

thanks for the link ... Aamir makes a compelling argument: I just turned against Gavin's propoasal ;-)
@_date: 2014-06-04 10:34:27
completely agree: I'm at a similar firm(not sayin who) and interest is vastly personal, and nobody(even at higher echelons) is willing to touch these with a bargepole (officially anyway) for a while: banks have this huge reputational risk thing going on: these things are considered more risky than progressive :(
Trade toxic CDO2s? fine ... anything remotely associated w crime: naaa!

yeah we need BigBangII : go on you Bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-05-23 10:31:05
agree 110% mate, this will deffoz help adoption too. IMO since we're already thinking in $terms, might as well {inverse} it: no diff to the analogy anyway.

not being funny, I'd really like to know: how can I short DRK please guys??

I don't think so: if u switch that chart to bitcoins(not currency), you'll see that volume has increased in BTc terms too
@_date: 2014-05-28 19:21:53
yeah can OP please correct the heading? its SR2, not SilkRoad: can be very misleading to noobs methinks

I dunno if spacemonkey has/had a choice tho
@_date: 2014-07-09 12:12:36
lol I like how u say "when" and not "if" ... agree of course
@_date: 2014-06-02 19:18:47
I was a bit curious abt that too ... I'd deffoz remember a 300btc send!! You my man are a BSD!!

agree, I didn't read it as a real threat: the guy is just douchy that way: hopefully they reinstate his account for the sake of free speech. 
@_date: 2017-02-26 12:50:55
very old post: Bloomberg says it aired on 25feb, which is bull. I was actually about to post it too b4 Reddit told me I am duping: OP should have read that warning mebbe
Still, I am baffled that people invest money with this fool: $13bn AUM ... WTF! Clearly this guy doesn't do his research(not just Bitcoin, it seems habitual), and they've actually made some pretty rubbish calls too! Sheeple?

I do like the double entendre on the word "advocate tho" ... props!

no, if it didn't work the first time it won't the next time(I tried hehe): I find that my xapo card gets declined/insuff funds randomly: try at a different place and you'll find it works: I get apologies from xapo by email sometimes, but mostly its random again: Just accept that it works ~75% of the time and you won't be disappointed :D
NB: My balance is always good, so its not that, just the stoopid company/mickey mouse system they run
@_date: 2016-05-19 13:30:49
+1 ... this more or less mirrors my experience in the UK: I lose ~3% selling BTC on a xapo card(i.e. buying things with it), and usually to buy BTC I lose 1-2%(whatever the BTC source)  
ie if u hold BTC and are using xapo, you're kindof betting BTC will rise in value hehe
@_date: 2016-05-27 10:03:27
I didn't think of the EU regs thing ... good point well made!
