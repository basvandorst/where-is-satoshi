Also seems as if the older nodes drop transactions in 3 days but newer ones are 2 weeks. Has it been over two weeks or “almost” 2 weeks

It should be dropped from the mempool eventually, not sure when that happens though or what causes it to happen

Great I will definitely incorporate that, thanks again!
@_date: 2015-12-06 17:29:53
I know the exact cause of this, I'm going to fix it later, thank you!

I definitely need to take a look at shortening the mining page as it is a wall of text haha. As far as Firefox goes, I know what the exact problem is and will fix it tonight. Thank you!
@_date: 2015-12-06 17:29:03
Good point, I'm going to change that part later tonight 
@_date: 2015-12-06 17:33:18
Will definitely do these things later tonight when I have the time to work on it! Also what did you mean about a link to the white paper? Thank you! 
@_date: 2015-12-06 17:29:25
I will take a look at it later! Thank you!

Hello good observation! It is the pronunciation for Bitcoin which is idiotic, it was the definition I found. Going to alter the definition as it isn't all that great. Cheers

Thank you for the reply! I will look into changing/fixing that tomorrow as I'm off to bed in a minute. Pulled that definition straight off coindesk I believe (think I cited it as well) so I will have to check it out. Appreciate the feedback.

I'm sure a simple VPN could bypass a lot of these exchanges IP blockers

I’m not sure if my opinion is an outlier or not but I agree that credit cards shouldn’t be used for crypto purchases.
It’s one thing for someone to buy with a debit card where they have the money available but with a credit card you don’t necessarily have the money. 
It’s a risk for banks to allow it, people that steal credit cards could buy crypto and send it wherever and the banks will never be able to trace it or do anything about it.
People could also open credit cards and max them out buying crypto with no intentions of paying it back and to banks that’s a risk. 
I don’t see why it would affect a market and I don’t feel like it’s the reason for the markets movement recently. I just wish people would actually think about and take time to understand things such as why banks would prohibit the use of credit cards for cryptos rather then immediately start freaking out and making matters worse. Markets go up and down, there was a huge rise the past 1-2 months, it’s not unnatural or out of line for a correction

Could be wrong but if you kept a copy of the public keys you could always check the balance as well as send funds without actually having the device

I would not suggest posting a picture

That’s a good question and possibly a double standard in regards to banning credit card crypto purchases. That being said I’m sure banks are getting a much larger influx of people using credit to buy crypto currencies vs. gambling sites. I think it’s stupid that they allow credit lines to be used in any form of gambling or investing where it could easily devalue quickly or be lost. Most people that would use credit for something like that aren’t putting it into a sound investment but rather trying to take a risky investment and to a bank that could backfire if it doesn’t pay off and the customer can’t pay it back

It seems weird but people are willing to bid above market price because they know the couldn’t buy xx,xxx bitcoins without raising the price substantially. In the end they’re saving money even paying 15% on top of market

Bitcoin ATMs offer cash for small amounts of btc (like maybe $500-$1000 a day). I believe for low amounts like that you just have to verify a text they sent to you. 
Could be worth a small drive if it's your only option, you'd be surprised how close they are to you sometimes

Have you seen how quickly these prices are fluctuating. That along with fees and having to wait for the transaction to get over to the other exchange kind of makes trying to take advantage of it very risky 
@_date: 2017-09-11 05:08:34
Bummer. Maybe try throwing a friend gas money and making a trip, if not you could try finding someone to buy however much you're selling

In my opinion I don't see cloud mining as legit. If they're already running the rigs it wouldn't make sense to lose money renting them out to people. Unless the price goes up heavily and you're locked into a contract for X amount of time, i feel like you usually get the short end of the stick

I'm familiar with nice hash and it's more of a hash loaning then hash selling such as genesis. My comment wasn't directed towards nice hash but rather websites such as genesis
I appreciate the reply though and I'm always willing to learn more
