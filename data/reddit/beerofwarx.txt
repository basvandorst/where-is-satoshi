I bet you don’t even really use bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 04:29:47
Yeah, it’s the top post on right now. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 04:26:15
Your mom has strong hands.

Must be a bear market if pictures of cakes are topping r/bitcoin again.

I thought it was going to be Big Lebowski’s “You’re not wrong, you’re just an asshole.”

It might be faster and easier to offer services and get paid in bitcoin. Maybe you can suck dick or sell drugs for bitcoins. 
@_date: 2018-12-26 05:24:03
Ok how do i do the thing?
@_date: 2018-12-05 21:35:36
Yeah, well this post got downvoted pretty heavily. So I hope you got what you came for.
@_date: 2018-12-25 17:49:35
Look you’re either willing to increase adoption or you’re not.

Different reddit edge servers keep slightly different vote tallies. That’s why a post’s karma can change when you hit refresh. 
Either way, whether you’re at +2 or -1 the community didn’t think much of what you had to say here. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 00:10:03
Your post shows negative to me. Looks like the community has spoken. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 20:57:34
This entire thread is terrible. Why are you still responding to it? LOL
@_date: 2018-12-05 02:11:58
Your shill game is weak. Bitcorn will continue to crash if you’re the best it’s got. And you might be. 
@_date: 2018-12-03 04:34:58


I guess they don’t stick around. 
@_date: 2018-12-04 23:43:38




Makes sense to me. 
@_date: 2018-12-04 03:59:18
Sorry your money lost 80% of its value over 2018. You seem to be coping well. 
@_date: 2018-12-03 04:38:08
No. 
@_date: 2018-12-03 19:15:10
I can get fucked by banks or get fucked by bitcoin whales. The first one is cheaper and faster. If you think that bitcoin doesn’t fund wars and crime then good for you. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 18:08:45
Yes but not in the world of bitcoin.

Tell me more...

If you can’t afford $1.50 you should find a better job. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 00:33:47
Oh my goodness, you’re a mess. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 12:43:19
Yes. My eyes will be filled with tears of laughter. Let’s see how bit-coin did yesterday. Oops, lost another 2.5%. More than the dollar lost all year. Dang!
@_date: 2018-12-25 16:51:37
Me me me
@_date: 2018-12-06 00:28:34
I don’t know, you seem pretty concerned about Reddit points. Why else would you downvote every one of my responses?
@_date: 2018-12-05 23:48:56
Your post right here, dipshit. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 00:11:53
Do your homework about crypto. You can’t buy anything with it except drugs and its value is crashing daily. 
@_date: 2018-12-03 04:36:20
You only lose money if you sell. 
@_date: 2018-12-19 04:46:39
Looks like it’s from a video game from 2003. 
@_date: 2018-12-03 21:45:29
LOL. Just be honest admit that you want to buy crack online. 
@_date: 2018-12-03 13:13:51
My ATM fees get refunded. I get 1.5% cash back on my credit card. Didn’t bitcoin cost $50 per transaction last year. If you’re using bitcoin to save money you’re doing it wrong.
