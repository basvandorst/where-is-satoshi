Yup it ended up going through over night.     I actually punched my TXID into this TX accelerator   and it got accepted so I think this helped.
In then end I got to learn a lot about bitcoin through this.    Im glad this subreddit is running.   You guys are a lot of help.   One of the better communities on reddit.

Is this a super low fee?

Thanks for the response.   I wanted it to go through faster but its no big deal as long as it does eventually.
Lesson learned.    You have helped ease my mind.   Thanks and have a good 1 :)

Blockchain.  The website I am loading money onto suggested that rate.   
I just put the TXID into here  and it got accepted.
So hopefully it will go through. 
I also think I got my first scammer attempt via PM.  
Have learned alot about bitcoin today lol

So Im new to bitcoin.   I just made a transaction with  29.259 sat/B fee.
Is this ever going to go through?   Did I make a mistake?   The site I was using suggested these fees but this is taking a long time.

This is my first time using bitcoin.   Im in a similar spot.
Been stuck for about 8 hours now :(   
How long have you been waiting?
