I think one huge thing everyone is overlooking is just new buyers in general. "halving" "profit" "china" "take my money". I think the amount of blind acquisition looking for easy profit could potentially drastically change what happens post half. Everyone and their grandma that's new expects mid July to mid August to become rich overnight. 
I have had so many friends, co-workers, etc coming up to me all of a sudden talking about bitcoin because it's back in the news sort of again. Asking about investments and getting rich. No one has every approached me in person before about such things. 
I'm going with pixie dust, gut feeling, SJW, idiot people, powerball tickets and the thought "it's guaranteed" fucking things up. As pointed out this is just protocols and I agree fully. I view early days of bitcoin and the bulls and bears of past equivalent of a post menopausal house wife reading a shit rag gossip mag in the grocery aisle checkout to get her information on what to do next in life. Which we were able to I feel leave behind a good amount to make the market more stable. But since it is so new, and renewed interest in "get rich quick" it's going to be fucky and sidways as hell.
I think, hope, and speculate on fairy dust is all the new investors will get scared after the half, pull out because the market is going down, crash it down a good good amount, then recovery back to something stable and reasonable while post months later marginally go back up.
my 9 cents here.
