They are Dutch. The thing about the Dutch is they are good traders in general.

Well, I think he's going a bit far and is quite opinionated, but he has a point with respect to her technical skill, and he also has a point w.r.t. fanboyism. All those guys mentioned have written code before, I think it is very reasonable to say that someone in the forefront of Bitcoin should at least have written something rudimentary.
I'm not hating on the gender thing, I think people like Lisa Su and Ginni Rometty are awesome (well, for me just Lisa is awesome because she's been steering that ship supremely).
dude be a bit more subtle

Yes. It is also illegal to smoke in Beijing.
I went there when the ban was in place, not a single Chinese person I saw was smoking /s

I don't know what proportion of the redditors are just plain stupid, and what proportion are astroturfers. Comments like that one do make me wonder and I think some people genuinely believe that kind of stupidity because they don't know much history, and fill their minds with junkfood news rather than good healthier stuff like The Economist or WSJ (which cost money)

A large group of people who "groupthinked" themselves into printing money rather than let crashes happen and let creative destruction occur.
I also think that you can't really blame them because no one want's to be the guy to blame when everything goes bad. People like Paul Volker are rare.

You say that but I am very cynical about this, I only trust people to follow their incentives and will only go for something they think will benefit them. 
If a downturn happens and everyone is broke cultures everywhere would prefer that their government and central bank step in, because they feel they have more of a vested interest in it, because it looks out for them.
That being said there are many cultures and central banks around and so I am glad bitcoin is here to remind them that they have a responsibility to their currency-more so to markets- because the value of the labour of their citizens will move over to crypto if they find their store of value undermined.

They are incentivised just as much as men already, We should just leave out the gender out of it altogether, they'll come, and if they don't, who cares, it's a level playing field already.
EDIT: I mean with crypto, because it's so out there everyone has equality of opportunity already. There's gender bias elsewhere.
