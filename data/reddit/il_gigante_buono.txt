Clever, did you come up with that all by yourself?

The idolisation of this dick by the community is irritating.

I'm all for the legalisation of drugs. But this wasn't some small scale operation, it was a massive criminal organisation that allowed organised crime to reach new markets. 
I really wish Satoshi would come back.

I'm just stating facts.

Except anarchy is a form of socialism and communism. The ridiculous capitalism version came way after. Not to mention communists always fight in these kinds of things.

Those words don't mean what you think they mean ( and I use thee term think very liberally with what you have just stated).

It hurt his case that when he was caught he was logged in to the account though.

This kind of shit is why the real Satoshi should reveal himself to stop these conmen getting in the media all the time. Also, I'd love to understand the mind of the person behind Bitcoin haha

Only if Satoshi is a tax dodger like Craig Wright.

Jesus Christ this sub is full of retards. The guy tried to have someone else murdered and tortured and payed to do so. Don't try the whole "oh he was totally not the only one on that account". What fucking person with an even decent amount of knowledge about computers SHARES  an account? Especially an account linked to so much fucking money. Jesus Christ.
