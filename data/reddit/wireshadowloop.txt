The only way to make blockchain without Bitcoin feasible would be to create an open market for proof of work. Let any arbitrary chain or transaction or ledger entry bid on height in a single global SHA256 POW Merkle tree. The higher your entry is, the less extra data and hash operations you need to carry along with your specific proof of work. So say Bitcoin txs fill up most of the top branches at the usual fee rate but then there are still cheap entries lower down that can get the same difficulty proof of work with a bit of extra data overhead. This essentially means that everything could be merge mined at a lower total cost and with more security, including real estate records and warehouse inventory and Pokemon cards etc etc.

I'm going to ignore private centrally controlled databases masquerading as  blockchain. For everyone else missing piece in most blockchain concepts is the proof of work authentication that provides decentralized immutability. An arbitrary block chain can't muster enough dedicated hashing power to make it immutable. To replicate the computational power of the Bitcoin mining network you'd have to pay out Bitcoin levels of rewards, so that it mostly out of the question.
So what's left if you want a truly immutable blockchain is to piggyback on someone else's proof of work. This is actually pretty easy to do because of the Merkle tree structure for hashing an arbitrary amount of data into the Merkle root which is then hashed again to get the proof of work output. The downside of piggybacking is that you have to carry around all the extra data to get down to your branch of the Merkle tree. 
Also because of Bitcoins validation rules if you want to piggyback on Bitcoin proof of workyou need to embed your hash data into a valid transaction using OP_Return. You are also restricted to Bitcoins 10 minute interval. It's a lot of unnecessary Bitcoin specific baggage to deal with.
The ideal situation would be if proof of work could be independent of that data it's proofing. So anyone can submit an arbitrary hash and a target difficulty and a maximum Merkle tree height or data baggage limit and miners aggregate it and work on it. The payment can be embedded inside the data like Bitcoin transactions or worked out separately outside. Basically strip mining down to its bare essentials and make everything else external.

At this point it would be easier to increase throughput by collectively spoofing timestamps than by increasing the block size.

what you are describing is a pyramid scheme

I didn’t say bitcoin was a pyramid scheme. I said what the OP was describing was. 
If the sole function and purpose of Bitcoin was to make early adopters wealthy with the money of late adopters then it would be a pyramid scheme.

There was a similar thing, it was called a Merkel tree and a hash pointer but it was not sexy like Blockchain. Append-only data structures existed long before Bitcoin did.

In investing terms, intrinsic value refers to future cash flows. It means the product has some value that is independent of the market value (extrinsic). Bond yields are an intrinsic value because you don’t need to sell the bond on the open market to receive them. Intrinsic value doesn’t mean that you can eat it or wear it. It’s just a tool for valuation. 
This causes a lot of ranting when people read something about Bitcoin not having any intrinsic value and taking it as an insult.

Bond yields are an intrinsic value because you don’t need to sell the bond on the open market to receive them. Intrinsic value doesn’t mean absolute value or that you can eat it or wear it or use it to survive on a desert island. It’s just a tool for valuation.
The definition causes a lot of argument, because when people hear that Bitcoin doesn’t have intrinsic value it sounds like an insult.

...or anyone who got margin called

No cash flow equals no intrinsic value. It’s purely market value (speculative). 
The difference is that if the market were to vanish overnight, a business with dividends would still have the same cash flow and the same value. Bitcoin however would be useless.

Why does everyone forget about the $32 bubble of 2011?
