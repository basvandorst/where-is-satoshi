Yep. And they have infiltrated with their fear mongering and alt pumping as well. There's a large ongoing attack on bitcoin and that sub is one of their main hubs. No doubt they run private communities to conspire as well.

This is what testnet is for.
@_date: 2016-03-04 23:41:34
Theyve been brigading this place for quite a while now.
@_date: 2016-03-04 04:14:52
Unless they are negative and the thread was brigaded.
@_date: 2016-03-05 02:42:17
Your best interests are in having shitcoins succeed. Take a seat.
@_date: 2016-03-04 00:30:40
There's a book called Mastering Bitcoin by Andreas Antonopoulos. He also has a ton of awesome youtube vids. Would be a good place to start.
@_date: 2016-03-05 02:41:26
Real talk.
@_date: 2016-03-01 05:53:56
redditor for 0 hours...21 upvotes....
but there's no brigade right?
@_date: 2016-03-04 23:49:07
Id stay away from xapo too. Anti bitcoin alt pumpers.
@_date: 2016-03-01 07:30:11


Maybe you missed the part where I didn't refer to everyone? I want a block size increase too, but in a safe and smooth manner. Not a contentious hard fork. And segwit is coming soon which is a nice capacity increase which will help until 2mb blocks are ready to be rolled out. You can't ignore the fact that the network is being spammed either. Check the front page. There's a post detailing just how cheap this can be done. Bitcoin is not supposed to be able to handle global transactions on chain right now. There are off chain solutions in the works. There's literally no need to panic. The fear is orchestrated. 
@_date: 2016-03-01 06:57:16
Bitcoin is still in experimental mode. It's not designed for the entire world to be able to use on chain transactions for nearly free. There are plans to implement near zero fee transactions. Quit fear mongering. 
@_date: 2016-03-01 02:56:50
Did you even read the post?
@_date: 2016-03-01 17:21:52
Theres no issue, just spammers. Fixes are in the works/on the way. Quit fudding.
@_date: 2016-03-05 03:48:00
Fine for what exactly?
@_date: 2016-03-01 06:56:02
Is that why caught recently using a sockpuppet of his own on this sub?
Gimme a break. 
@_date: 2016-03-01 16:17:09
@_date: 2016-03-02 14:52:24
Rootstock will be pegged to bitcoin on a sidechain. I can tell by your post history you are trolling as an ethpumper though.
@_date: 2016-03-01 05:37:31


Most people are completely clueless and have no technical knowledge to hold an opinion of their own in the first place. 
@_date: 2016-03-01 00:44:36
Only if you dont understand bitcoin or cant afford a few pennies.
@_date: 2016-03-05 00:24:22
Boycott Coinbase! 
@_date: 2016-03-04 17:40:05
Check his post history. 
@_date: 2016-03-01 01:18:56
China doesn't consider litecoin an alt. To them ltc is on the same level as btc.
@_date: 2016-03-05 00:14:11
I know. Feathercoin is really exploding back onto the scene!
@_date: 2016-03-05 02:24:38
Yes. Coinbase is an enemy of bitcoin and needs to be boycotted. Remove any funds and find a new place to trade. Great news for Gemini It looks like.
@_date: 2016-03-04 00:20:06
Reopen wallet using -zapwallettxes and send again with a higher fee.
@_date: 2016-03-04 23:45:57
Done. 
@_date: 2016-03-01 15:16:26
ignoring the facts now. 
Just start ignoring people when proved wrong with facts right? 
@_date: 2016-03-01 05:28:55
I don't want to make accusations, but this is like the 10th post he's made saying the same thing. I feel like he's purposefully trying to stir the pot. 
@_date: 2016-03-01 06:54:29


Is that why caught (your classsic leader)  recently using a sockpuppet of his own on this sub? 
Who's really the one in denial here?
@_date: 2016-03-04 21:30:54
From the looks of his latest incoherent rambling and lies coinbase is dangerously close to not even being a bitcoin company anymore. I was already boycotting them, but there's a damn good reason to be vocal about it now.
@_date: 2016-03-01 18:05:54
Segwit by april. 2mb blocks snd LN to follow. Do some research.
@_date: 2016-03-01 07:44:45


Guess you never checked my post history cause you're making things up. 
@_date: 2016-03-01 15:31:21
He also was also caught using sockpuppets in this sub. Proof: 
@_date: 2016-03-01 07:17:42
And your proof: 
You're wrong. Now what?
@_date: 2016-03-04 17:46:08
He gets way too much hate and not nearly enough credit. Thank you for all your contributions. There are people who really appreciate it.
@_date: 2016-03-05 01:17:58
@_date: 2016-03-05 00:41:09
Boycott coinbase! Company is scum! Spread the word!
@_date: 2016-03-04 02:50:41
@_date: 2016-03-04 23:42:40
Agreed. Most redditors are mindless facebook intelligence level drones. Still worth exposing at least.
@_date: 2016-03-01 16:41:28
Of course it's not "down". But plenty of tactics mentioned are currently being deployed by the attackers. Agreed the problem isn't real. It's all manufactured.
@_date: 2016-03-01 05:30:54


It seems like he believes 100% of people who discuss bitcoin on reddit genuinely have the best interests for bitcoin. He could easily be playing the part of downplaying the hostile side. 
@_date: 2016-03-01 00:45:37
Thats for 2mb not segwit.
@_date: 2016-03-05 02:51:31
I keep seeing people talk about the past. Hitler also once helped someone.
@_date: 2016-03-01 05:21:32
So much this. thinks it will "bring the community together" but in reality he underestimates how many people there are and how many sockpuppets they use that simply just want to disrupt bitcoin no matter the case. These people don't have bitcoins best interest. If capacity is increased, there will be a call for a new fork, and new fud about some "problem" will be spread. It will *never* end. There are people who are anti bitcoin and there always will be. We can't simply "listen to the (anonymous) community". That is dangerous. 
@_date: 2016-03-01 00:40:38
@_date: 2016-03-02 07:34:51
It's just being pumped/propped up as part of the ongoing attack on bitcoin (classsic/network spam/confirmation fud etc). Just ignore it. They need something they can point to and pretend it's a threat. Etherium is not a currency or store of value.
@_date: 2016-03-01 17:32:15
Edit: wow bullshit this was removed. 
Agreed. I believe he's working to stir the pot and trying get core to bend to comply with a loud vocal group due to manufactured fear. I hate to think of the precedent set and danger of that happening in the future if core did actually bend and give in. Props to them for remaining vigilant, level headed and focused at times like these.
@_date: 2016-03-05 00:14:45
Number 2 can't be trusted.
@_date: 2016-03-04 00:26:09
Sorry, I'm not following. Same thing literally happened to me earlier today and I did what I said and resent and it got confirmed. Hopefully someone with a little more know how can help.
@_date: 2016-03-05 02:08:22
Anyone else get the feeling coinbase is insolvent?
@_date: 2016-02-29 20:19:31
This is being done on purpose by classiccoin supporters. Spam network....then spam about the network being full. Idiots. 
@_date: 2016-02-25 16:24:36
Seriously though...why did you link this post to the other sub? You just showed them where to brigade.
@_date: 2016-02-26 03:13:27
I'm obviously aware. Now it's not a wallet though so it should be removed. I'm sure the link was considered.
Either that or add all the other exchanges /s

Buttcoin ------&gt;
@_date: 2016-02-25 16:32:25
Someone did. They aren't trying to listen or understand though. All it did was cause more of a brigade.
@_date: 2016-02-25 21:36:18
You're clearly ignorant.

Go away troll.

Rootstock renders ethereum completely useless. Http://rootstock.io

No, it's private. Bruce said this was because people act differently in public vs private settings.

Someone needs to remove Coinbase from the list of wallets on bitcoin.org. False advertising.

No. 
@_date: 2016-02-25 05:37:57
Lmao no. Premine. 40% yearly inflation. Its not really even a currency. Also Rootstock being built on top of Bitcoin renders any snd all of ethereums smart contract features 100% useless. 
@_date: 2016-02-27 00:43:58
Can't spell bitcoin without clinton (-l+b)
@_date: 2016-02-29 23:34:54
Agreed. It's a full on brigade. I cant be the only one whos noticing the users here have been higher than usual all day.
@_date: 2016-02-25 21:41:40
Wow lol. Just stop.
@_date: 2016-02-25 14:53:14
True. In b4 removed tho.

Meanwhile this guy still pandering to buttcoin 2.0 Edit: youre supposed to click his name and see recent posts for proof.
@_date: 2016-02-24 14:06:06
This article is false. They are reporting information from a fake Brian Twitter account.

Get your coins off coinbase or you might end up with worthless crappy altcoin tokens.
@_date: 2016-02-29 17:33:08
Spams network...asks if there's a stress test.

Thanks for the laugh.
@_date: 2016-02-24 21:01:53
Fyi this post has been linked to from that "other sub". 
@_date: 2016-02-29 23:25:53
Nothing to do with congested network....70 upvotes and top of page. Not too long ago this would maybe have 5 upvotes. Brigade in full force.
@_date: 2016-02-27 04:35:04
If you have an offline machine you should try a cold electrum wallet or electrum multisig wallet.
Edit: you said you keep the password hint with the keys? Which are uploaded online? That is a terrible idea. 
@_date: 2016-02-24 20:52:14
But it makes sense to expose the scammers.
@_date: 2016-02-25 21:43:48
Boohoo. Tired of his constant bullshit.
@_date: 2016-02-24 23:23:42
That has nothing to do with what I said. This is about reddit subs. That doesn't actually have much to do with bitcoin in reality.
@_date: 2016-02-25 16:04:52
Awesome post!
@_date: 2016-02-28 18:00:43
You should gave the ltc key right? Also, litecoin planning to change the character addresses start with to differ from btc in a future update.
@_date: 2016-02-24 20:51:04
Funny thing...i have you tagged as a classic shill haha.
@_date: 2016-02-26 08:05:01
Guess you havent heard of Rootstock? Http://rootstock.io
@_date: 2016-02-24 15:55:17
Lol. Plot thickens.
@_date: 2016-02-26 18:33:07
I meant /rbtc. Thats the new buttcoin. Actual buttcoin sub can bring the lolz.
@_date: 2016-02-24 21:45:47
You people started your own classic sub. You should stay there. You people opposed this sub with great hostility but yet you can't stay away from it. Go away.
@_date: 2016-02-26 14:54:24
