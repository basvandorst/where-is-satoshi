Hmm.  Yeah that should slow it down a little bit.  Doesn't Google require mobile phone confirmation to create accounts? Or is that just for Gmail

I hope he perfected preventing cheaters! Or this will be exploited really fast.

Simple explanation for this, the "across international borders" line proves it. Amex, along with every banking/credit company in the USA has strict regulations and requirements to prevent money laundering tactics to the best of their ability. Since bitcoin is a potential way to do this they have to cover their ass. Now they have the questions answered if something comes up they can say "well we asked and they said no" and it's out of their hands. 
If they don't "try" to prevent laundering they can face huge fines and penalties if something bad happens.

If Tigerdirect and or Overstock stop accepting Bitcoin (which really would only happen if something horrible happened to Coinbase) then I'd be worried.

I personally really do not care much what the price of Bitcoin is in USD. I don't want to ever convert my Bitcoin back to fiat currency. I simply want to use it for pay for things over the internet without going through a middleman. Or perhaps paying for an international service.

I shouldn't even dignify this with a response, but you're wrong here. Not sure if this is a bot or not. 
I said "I would *of course* sell goods or perform services". If I replace 
that with "would have", we get
"I would *have course* sell goods or perform services".

Shame on Amazon SES for letting these malicious emails out.

Didn't China ban Google a few years ago? and they seem to be doing pretty well. Lot's of stuff is banned in China.

They only just added it so they are likely waiting for the data to get populated (maybe a few days or a week) to add it to the filter/search system. Can't wait until it's active! I don't know any other reliable way to find out who accepts Bitcoin in my area.
Example: I'm hungry right now. I'd love, right now, to say "where can I buy some hot food with bitcoin?" and then just go there and buy it.
@_date: 2014-03-31 17:01:47
In an ideal world, I would of course sell goods or perform services (work) for Bitcoins so I wouldn't need to buy more. But yeah for now that is unlikely. However the bitcoins I have now should be able to last a while, unless the price goes down (d'oh there's that price thing again). 
Also, interestingly it is much easier for any random person to buy something with bitcoin than to sell with it.

If Zynga is indeed starting to accept Bitcoins, I wouldn't say that Facebook is far off. Zynga is heavily tied to Facebook, and Facebook needs all the revenue channels it can get.

From all the bad things heard about MtGox coding and business/security practices (or lack thereof), it is not at all far-fetched to believe that they didn't back up their data. Someone said they didn't even use version control for the code. 
If they didn't backup data (or backup properly), any hacker entering the system might have simply extracted everything they could and then deleted all existing data.

This is a really good way of putting it, and at the same time very chilling when you think about it.

The fork icon or whatever only shows up on github if you fork it through github interface.  This is usually only done for quick fixes and/or if you want to merge them back in to the main repository (with a  pull request). 
In the case of a major project fork, it's best to import it as a separate project.

New York is over 2000/mo for studios unless the area is "run down" or moderate crime &amp;  gangs 
@_date: 2015-08-09 13:21:14
Does this mean NY residents must withdraw all their kraken funds now and close? What about the Mt gox refund feature? 
@_date: 2015-08-24 05:03:36
Yeah this seems like using Bitcoin as a loose adjective, I could see why they'd do it. Imagine if a ceo of a solar power installation company was arrested... They might have a headline "Solar power CEO arrested..." but it wouldn't exactly mean they think he is the CEO of solar power.

Yeah either the truth or just anything to get them to stop. But who cares right!?

My guess is due to strict separation of internal Google teams to slow down anti competitive practices.
