The file isnt corrupt or anything, I simply wanna use my wallet.dat file which is the most straight forward and seemingly common thing to do with a btc client.....
@_date: 2019-07-09 04:27:18
Yep. I have multiple backups.
@_date: 2019-07-20 10:48:09
So I can send all my btc from bitcoin core to electrum. Them open a old copy of the wallet that had the btc using each individual crapcoin wallet and they will be there?
@_date: 2019-07-20 10:49:14
So make 4 Copies of my wallet and open in each crapcoin wallet.  How do I protect my btc? Cant I send the btc off first?

Well all I really wanna do is send my bitcoins, have I asked the wrong question in the OP?
@_date: 2019-07-19 13:53:11
What client should I use to transfer to my new wallet?
Im scared of losing my BTC are their steps to take?
So do I just open up Bitcoin Core and then open up the new client and send everything over while online?
@_date: 2019-07-19 13:22:22
So I need to send my BTC to another wallet on my computer and then to an exchange, is there a best way to do this? Currently all I have is Bitcoin Core as a client l would like to use BCH and I think that list is missing ZCash?
Before making this thread I was gonna send most my BTC to an exhcange to cash out using Bitcoin Core wallet.
@_date: 2019-07-19 13:54:33
What client should be recieving using this new address?
bcash sv, bgold, bdiamond, Zcash are what Im trying to get out.
@_date: 2019-07-09 04:24:27
Okay thanks I will try this.

If you have a new client, trezor, computer or password and you wanna transfer a large sum that is large to you and 15k would definetly be to almost anyone then you definetly would wanna test a small amount like $5 dollars worth and see what happens beforehand, not just for malware but anything else like the address gets rejected or was mistyped or the exchange you are using has hidden fees.

The average person would have noticed though,  this isnt an issue of misunderstanding or mistrust but a lapse in attention, visual memory or a normal healthy level of anxiety.
@_date: 2019-08-09 23:11:47
Its possible.  
My point is a computer solely used for bitcoin from the store with its first installation of windows and no antivirus is infinitely more safer than a computer used for daily use even if it has 2 of the best AVs.  
You want to not surf the web on it at all, keep it regularly updated,  behind a firewall and only have it online to transfer blockchain info and transactions. No video games, no websites not even news or youtube, no documents such as pdf, no viewing family photos, no plugging in peoples USBs or playing music, just crypto. And keep it offline as much as possible even for 10mins.
Every 10mins your computer is doornocked by bots trying to be hacked.

Is there a trezor that is encrypted and decrypted from the hardware? To stop someone recording your pin via software and physically stealing the trezor.
And one that uses a password dat backup rather than a seed.

Laugh now but mark my words.
@_date: 2019-08-12 05:53:32
Because I was told it was something to do with Chinese new year buy up or some BS. Like how theres end of financial year sales.
@_date: 2019-08-09 00:44:47
Ah okay, that works.

I usually get a new reddit account every few months.

If the numbers on the trezor are always the same then the PC needs to send these numbers to the trezor which can be intercepted by software. The only secure way is if the number on the trezor is randomly generated each time.
@_date: 2019-08-08 15:05:15
Any info passing to and from the device can be intercepted by software.

Kaspersky has the best track record. Check out AV ratings websites, but tbh you shouldnt need to rely on an AV. Your BTC machine should only be used for BTC and not web browsing or any other activities.
@_date: 2019-08-08 15:03:39
It doesn't matter if all you are using it for is BTC. I personally use Firefox because it has a lot of privacy and security tweaking you can do under the hood.
I mean written on paper so if someome stumbles across it, its not 12 or 24 random words that seem suspicious but something innocent like a music playlist written down.
@_date: 2019-08-08 00:07:54
Use an isolated machine.
If you use a trezor have your BTC sent to it as a new address and dont type down your seed into any computer or say it out loud. Keep the seed paper safe and have at least one off site copy. No one should know where your seed is kept and if possible dont make it word for word or anything obviously a crypto seed if seen.
Make it a music playlist or something with the seed words  italicized.  
You wanna protect it from loss, theft and weather damage such as flood or fire.
The machine you use the trezor on should only be used for the trezor and should only be online when you do transactions. All online devices get randonly port scanned on average every 15mins by door knocking bots checking for exploits.
Anything can be hacked, no safe is safe.
@_date: 2019-08-14 00:50:15
Yep, a lot of that BTC was put into other cryptos at the time and history always repeats itself. People made money off that shorting and new deals will be made to short other curencies.
@_date: 2019-08-14 02:10:19
Dumb because we are typing instead of speaking.
@_date: 2019-08-14 00:56:12
Mind blown.
@_date: 2019-06-17 13:27:35
Is it the wallet.dat file or the default wallet file you need to keep backed up?
Also my friend has a file when opened it has some text and lines of random strings but no black squares, could this be the wallet.dat file? I know it was renamed but we didn't expect a file readable in notepad.
@_date: 2019-06-17 18:29:00
My friend made it in bitcoin core on linux but on mac it says the wallet file is corrupt and can't be recovered.
@_date: 2019-08-14 00:48:32
I'm not implying to sell, fiat will crash.
@_date: 2019-08-14 17:24:31
@_date: 2019-06-17 17:40:16
If the wallet.dat file is made on linux can it be opened on a Mac or Windows client?
@_date: 2019-09-02 01:52:52
Okay thanks.
@_date: 2019-09-02 01:52:45
Thanks.
