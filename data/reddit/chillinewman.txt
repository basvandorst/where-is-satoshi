Many have argued that clean surplus energy fuels Bitcoin to a significant degree. In the short run, which is relevant for our snapshot, curtailment rates of clean resources may be large in certain areas with Bitcoin mining activity. Especially in southwestern China, hydropower accounts for around 80% of the generated electricity in the provinces of Yunnan and Sichuan.[22]( Yunnan curtailed 31.2 TWh of hydropower in 2016, which equaled 11.6% of the total electricity generation in the province.[23](
However, **mining activities can also be found in regions with coal-heavy power generation**, such as in the province of Inner Mongolia.Pool regional statistics of BTC.com suggest a 58% versus **42%** split between hydro-rich and coal-heavy regions in China. The ratio represents the computing power reported from Shenzhen (server location closer to hydro-rich regions) versus Beijing (server location closer to coal-heavy regions).[25](
If we weight the emission factors of Sichuan (265 g/kWh) and Inner Mongolia (947 g/kWh) accordingly,[26](
we obtain an adjusted emission factor of 550 g/kWh, which we use in our calculations to account for the special case of China.

Please stop with the unfounded claims. Stop denying science. Is not true that the middle ages had 7000 ppm of CO2, the last time it was 400 ppm of CO2 was in the mid-Pliocene, 3 million years ago.  [
There is no agenda to take it to 150 ppm pure malicious insanity if you believe that.

Is not a comparison this article is only stating the carbon footprint of mining bitcoin. Too much bias here against it.

I agree is smaller now but still significant every year, even with hardware wallets and exchanges.  And I don't believe it will stop. Ex. Death, misplaced keys, wallets, no backup. Maybe institutional investors will last longer but even then, they are going to lose some every year. IT issues expected.

what's the yearly rate of lost bitcoins?
when are they going to be lost completely or close to completely? Could that be a long term problem?

Maybe a statistical analysis will help. It might be a problem if is a reason for a loss of appeal. Some people won't risk it others yes. But even backups fail or are loss. Paper backup in a Swiss vault might last  or like the voyager gold disk or crystal storage [ In that extreme that utility value drops.
