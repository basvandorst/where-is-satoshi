This. Right. Here. Bitcoin should be complementary to credit cards (for now), not a replacement. If you want to buy a laptop, use a damn credit card; if you want to buy an app or an ebook for 99 cents, send money to your family in the Philippines, or buy porn without your wife knowing about it, use bitcoin.

This is like asking what stops people from beating me up and taking my wallet. Nothing, really, besides that it's illegal.

Thank Christ. If PayPal/Western Union aren't allowed to just fuck off with everyone's money, neither should any bitcoin exchanges be so allowed. For all the apocalyptic predictions I've read about regulation, US authorities seem to be exercising enormous restraint. Let's hope this is the exception that proves the rule.
