I bought some at $1.85 back when the silk road was brand new, and I had no idea what I was doing. I bought what I needed, and then never logged back into the silk road for another year. When I had logged back in my leftover btc's had a ridiculous amount of value for what I had considered to be a couple coins leftover in my pocket. From that point I bought a few more, because they were still only like $8, and they are currently sitting in a wallet I have no idea how to access. I know I used them with an old college email that doesn't exist anymore, and I have no idea how to go about finding them.

Sorry if this is a super annoyong question, but could you explain what a fork is to me? It would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

And anyone can purchase these futures? Why wouldn't everyone just choose to do that? Simply because of the higher initial investment?

Bro... 6'2" is not thaaat tall. I am 6ft and there's never been a car that I haven't been able to fit in. Your choice of vehicles is essentially endless. Don't be that guy that goes "Oh no that car simply will not do! I am 6ft 2 and you just brought out a Honda accord. What is that a sedan for ants? Are you crazy!" That type of person is super annoying, meaning the type of person that just spews bullshit all of the time.

yeah this worries me about myself. I know that if I study it I can figure it out and understand it, but where should I go to start learning about all of this stuff. It really is a foreign language to me at this point, and just don't know which resources I should be using to clear everything up. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:24:48
or you are just a huge pussy. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:20:24
yes... thats exactly what he is saying.

how stingy are you? $500 is not that much money. I can make it back within a couple weeks. I make tips every night and can easily live off of those for a week or so until i get my paycheck. What is my risk here? That I lose $500. Big fucking deal. I'm not gonna be filing for bankruptcy after that one. Whats the possible reward here? A couple hundred bucks. Sounds good to me lets do it. And for you to tell me I "haven't even done due diligence on this risk," is a wee bit ridiculous to me. How many weeks of research to you expect me to conduct on this simple investment? I have certainly put in a few hours reading and learning about bitcoins and what exactly they are. I think I will proceed after this. Just so I can save your username in order to come back and let you know how successful I have been. I will certainly remember to delete your username if I am unsuccessful.

from mt.gox. And after i did that my coins just disappeared from mtgox. And now their supposed to be in the wallet but I have no access to the wallet.

To me that seems like a waste of time. I can live for a week off the tips I make until I get another pay check. I am a student and know how to make 10 dollars last me a week. Theres no worry in investing everything to my name. It also helps to have parents that are willing to help you out when you need it. 
@_date: 2013-07-28 23:22:41
yes I am retarded. Sleep well knowing that you're better than one more person out there. Fucking cunt. 
@_date: 2013-10-02 21:15:46
Nah it was fine. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 04:02:48
fuuuuuck it. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 03:59:49
thats not what I am doing. Even if i do lose it all I won't need them to bail me out. I make good tips every night and could easily live off of those until I get my next pay check. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 04:01:38
this is great advice and exactly what I was looking for. Thank you. 
@_date: 2013-07-28 22:52:48
fucking christ. Did you even read what he just wrote? 
@_date: 2013-04-23 01:36:51
thank you. 
@_date: 2013-07-28 23:41:40
And I will sleep well knowing that I am not just another pussy who spends his day calculating the variance numbers between a short  stack and a big stack. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 04:34:03
this gave me the exact push I was looking for. Well well said, and I thank you. This advice I plan on using for the rest of my life.

im going big or im not even going to bother. There's no sense in investing $50 or $100. With that investment if the prices to go up considerably my return is going to be frustratingly pointless. I am financially stable because I am a student and my parents still love me enough to help me out. $500 lost will not require me to move back in with my parents or anything. I am just gonna have to live off tips for a week or so. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 04:08:09
basically yeah. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 04:00:08
how so? 
@_date: 2013-04-23 04:35:52
at this point with only $500 i guess you could say I would like to gamble a little bit. I do understand what you are saying though, and at first I wasn't going to, but now I will definitely consider it.

whatever dude. If you are really going to read into it that hard than you could say anything. But clearly he knew that they didn't mind it being shared for a reason.
