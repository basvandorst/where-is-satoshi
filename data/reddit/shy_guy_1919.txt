Specifically, cutting off funding for Alex Jones forces him out of business.  There is no other accessible way for people to give to him without handing him their credit card, which is ridiculous.  That makes him a huge target for hacking.
Bitcoin is nice in that it may help to alleviate some of it, if he can get people on board, but it's still not even close to being as legitimate a replacement as paypal.

It is true.  It's called WeChat.  She isn't using bitcoin in this gif.

Except that PayPal has a monopoly.
This would be like shutting off water and electric to all the members of a certain political party in a town, effectively forcing them out and violating their rights.

It is censorship.  His views are being actively suppressed for things he said years ago.
Censoring people we don't like is a very slippery slope.  Sure, this time it's Alex Jones, but would people be ok with Paypal banning legitimate third party political candidates?  What about minority rights activists?  Environmentalists?
Alex Jones says some wacky stuff, but I genuinely do not believe he thinks he is lying.  He actually believes what he says.  If this sort of stuff continues, it won't be long before we have serious problems.
Alex Jones should be protected for the same reasons that the Westboro Baptist Church should be protected (at least their speech).  You must protect the extreme views to allow political discourse.
Violence and violation of the rights of others should be the only line we draw.

Not to mention the fact that the federal agents who oversaw all the "hitman" stuff he supposedly did stole a bunch of bitcoins for themselves, a few hundred thousand worth at the time.
I'm pretty sure that he didn't try to hire a hitman, and  that it was just a cover for the agents stealing the coins.

It's your job to make challenging shit easy.  If you put challenging shit onto your audience, they're not even going to pay attention.

It's a poll of people who follow Ron Paul, which is to say, libertarians who don't trust the government.
This proves nothing except that Ron Paul, a libertarian, is followed on twitter by, GET THIS, libertarians who the fuck would've thought?

One of the agents only got 8 years and Ross got two life sentences.  
Also, how can you possibly trust an investigation when you have agents actively profiting from the people they are arresting?  That creates major issues in terms of actual justice.  That alone should have resulted in much of the case being thrown out.

If they collect taxes to pay for the government, then they are exerting substantial force onto the currency, likely completely controlling its value.

I'd say it's possible that if we achieve enough publicity for him, that it may be possible for him to get a presidential pardon before he dies.  He is very young and we will have many presidents before his death.  Obama pardoned a lot of people who were in for life for non-violent life sentences for drug sale or use (three strikes law).
I am also very happy to sign petitions like this simply for the negative publicity it gives to the drug war and the law enforcement agencies that perpetuate it.

The federal agents that arrested him stole hundreds of thousands of dollars worth (at the 2013 price) of his bitcoin.

How old are you?
They will tax your income regardless of whether or not you are paid in cash (you don't have to be paid in cash right now, you can be paid in stock or whatever else).
They tax your house.
They tax your car.
They have expensive militaries to enforce taxes.
Don't get me wrong, I love cypto, but I don't see it toppling the established world powers.  I see it circumventing a lot of bullshit rules (drug war) and protecting free speech.

I mean, when OP puts it that way, it kinda makes the fiat look better because the USA is willing to literally murder other people to enforce its value.
You can hack code, but you can't hack a bomb that's speeding towards you.

There's nothing quite like laughing it up as you see your bitcoin profits grow, and the *inferior* shitcoins bow and bend to the utter whim of our god: that almighty bitcoin.
