i am not asking for my own usage. i am trying to learn the architecture that coinbase uses and what they mean by what they wrote in the paper i referenced.

thanks! yep my follow up question diverged from original sorry ;) 
appreciate your explanation

very interesting thanks, by "slow trading" , do you mean 10 min or 1 hr ? or longer? 
so do traders commonly keep all their funds at the exchange completely? or is it possible to say pull it out at the end of day/week?  i am thinking if maybe some kind of hybrid strategy could be used, personal wallet for slow to settle trades, and exchange wallet for instant trades etc. I am just thinking if i was an institutional trader i would not be comfortable storing millions in someone elses wallet longer than i need to :)

thanks! I've been reading about transaction signing and have to admit that's the most challenging concept.  why does transaction signature need to also contain a puzzle? does the recipient of the transaction solve the puzzle using senders public key?

thanks! my Q was more about storing bitcoin in my own wallet. does CB or bisq allow that ?

fuck sorry i mixed 2 of my questions.  please disregard preceding comment! 
I am thinking in terms of designing a trading infrastructure similar to Coinbase. it would not be a personal account, but large volume institutional account. 
so yes, no withdrawal fees, but also security and custody. i want to be able to control what i own at the end of the day/week/month w/out depending on 3rd party wallets.

I am asking from the perspective of creating another coinbase. if i was to design cold storage, how would it work? 
are you saying coinbase stores smaller amounts in "hot wallets"? what happens when a larger amount is needed?  that's the part i would like to learn about.

thanks this is fascinating stuff!! 
as for *"or each address there are an average of 2\^96 public keys"*, that means public keys have a range of values depending on each underling private key? I guess they do but that range would still appear to be random.

hmm so I am reading [Mastering Bitcoin]( by Antonopoulos, and here is what he says: 








... 


    
    
what the hell is he talking about :) 
@_date: 2018-09-17 20:46:37
interesting! 
so why is address space so much smaller than key space?  
are keys shorter than addresses ? 
@_date: 2018-09-17 12:18:02
so i saw this number referenced as 10\^48 in a few places now, while mastering bitcoin claims its 10\^77. which is correct?

thanks! the hot/cold wallet concept is what i needed to continue my research :)) 
@_date: 2018-08-30 14:56:33
awesome thanks

when we look at an address, we she the SHA, not a string of bits. so it seems related. 
@_date: 2018-09-18 16:30:51
wow thanks! this is really filling gaps in my understanding. 
*An address is the result of a series of hashing operations performed on the public portion of such a keypair*
hmm from what I read, public keys is created form private key. and so you only need to store/secure as the other keys can be derived from it. 
i guess what you meant by above a recipient would hash the public key just to verify the private w/out knowing the private?
