Thanks!. Our whole goal is bitcoin privacy, it's not the popular or easy route, and we have a lot of work to do still but it's important and it's our passion. 
CoinJoin Sim: When possible will build your transaction with multiple inputs (that havent been seen together before) and multiple change outputs so that it appears to be a coinjoin transaction on the block chain. It's an obfuscation technique we implemented early on and doesn't work perfectly mostly because it requires a well seasoned wallet with a lot of inputs that aren't linked together.

In the meantime if you are really dedicated to getting Samourai on your phone you can install Android Studio for free and build the project yourself and then load the APK onto your device, it's not too complicated really, Android Studio makes it pretty simple. 
edit: meant to respond to @_date: 2016-04-12 05:43:29
Yes we think so, we have been using it as a daily for the last year plus. Obviously write down your mnemonic and remember your passphrase and it should be impossible to lose funds.
As for changes upcoming, we are still using 3rd party APIs so from a privacy perspective thats not wonderful, so that is being addressed. Other major changes include mobile mixing, segwit support, and more.
@_date: 2016-04-17 10:29:00
You may be interested in [Samourai Wallet]( We are a privacy focused wallet provider developing on Android and soon iOS. Our code is [Open Source]( You should really look into supporting BIP47 as a priority. Good luck with your project!

Hi there,
This may help you. 
@_date: 2016-04-28 06:47:23
Adding the payment code is a one time thing afterwards it is as simple as tapping on their label in the list to send them Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-04-11 22:16:37
Indeed we did. We pledged we would be open sourced by March 2016, and so it was. We are a bit behind in our roadmap due simply to logistical challenges but we continue to chug along and saw no reason to delay the OSing
Our roadmap has been updated on our site to give insight on our current priorities (de-coupling all third party API's, mobile mixing, along with SegWit and RBF stuff mostly). We're really looking forward to getting as much feedback on our initial BIP 47 implementation, and hopefully more of you folks here will try it out now you can examine the code first. 
@_date: 2016-04-11 22:50:29
Will definitely look into getting added. Thanks!
@_date: 2016-04-30 09:09:37
Just to clear up: We didn't fork from Dark Wallet and we aren't trying to be them, but we are big supporters of theirs. Development hasn't stopped on Dark Wallet, it is just slow and infrequent. We have had some discussions with them regarding BIP47 which I would say is about half way implemented in Dark Wallet on a development branch of the wallet.
@_date: 2016-04-11 23:05:39
I've had a read through on their site regarding submissions. I will discuss it with the lead dev tomorrow, but I do not see any reason why we wouldn't do this. We may wait until it is fully released (as in not Alpha) before hand. Either way we'll keep you informed. 
@_date: 2016-04-24 11:46:10
If you still need this ability you can use Samourai or Sentinel (if you prefer to just provide an xpub). Go to the receive screen, note the address, and then press the refresh button in the top toolbar. Hope that helps. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 01:21:40
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:54:45
We respectfully disagree that it shouldn't be an option. Our primary concern is privacy, not transaction fees. If you send from a segwit address to a non segwit address and the change goes back to a segwit address, it is immediately obvious upon looking at the transaction on the blockchain which output is the destination and which output is the change. Our like-type policy is a privacy feature that you may opt out of. 
As for other settings I would follow this guide 
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:49:30
This is correct. 
As of right now users still must **trust** Samourai nodes and servers to report correct information. BitcoinJ is used for signing (etc) on the local device and that is all.
Once we release 1.0 we will also be open sourcing our backend API layer that sits on top of Bitcoin Core. This will allow users to run their own local copies of Samourai API on top of Bitcoin Core and not need to trust us at all.
Hope this helps. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 06:05:58
This will be useful to you
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:41:32
It is open source, licensed under the UNLICENSE. I am also not sure what was meant by proprietary. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:29:31
Hey there. Samourai will do what you need. We are still Alpha, mainly due to lack of UI elements for many areas (very barebones, though some users prefer that), and minor stability issues depending on the device (force closes every once in a while). 
Feel free to do some research and ask around. If you do decide to give us a shot you may want to review these help articles regarding segwit and like-type outputs, and configuring for lowest fees.
@_date: 2018-01-28 16:30:06
It is primarily still alpha due to UI and general stability (random force closes etc).
There has never been a report of lost funds since we started Samourai in 2015, and as long as you write down your 12 word mnemonic and do not forget your passphrase it is pretty much impossible to lose access to your funds. 
Hope this helps. 
PS - Happy Cake Day :)

Because if you connect via 8333 you cannot guarantee you are connecting to **your** own node. Rather, you are just connecting to the p2p network. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 07:32:58
Hey there, glad to hear you are enjoying it. We have noticed the small delay in updating transactions. This is the result of very quick and somewhat unplanned and unexpected growth straining our backend infrastructure/nodes. We have recently made some changes that increase performance and reliability across the board, but at the cost of a small delay in displaying transactions sometimes (usually 5-10 seconds). We are working to get this back to 0.5-1 second delay in both Samourai and Sentinel. 
Thanks again for the support
@_date: 2018-01-03 06:04:31
Hi, 
Trusted Node is totally optional. If you enable Trusted Node, then transactions will not be passed along by us, but rather your own node. Read about Trusted Node here 
Happy to answer any further questions!
@_date: 2018-01-02 13:33:38
Hey, no problem. 
No specific reason other than resources and time. We will release our 1.0 product out of Alpha on Android and shortly after release a 1.0 version on iOS as well. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:30:52
Back then (Feb, 2016) we were still using 3rd party APIs to get balance and tx history. Also the code was not yet open source.
Now we do not use any 3rd party APIs and the client side code is open source.
We have not yet open sourced our backend APIs - this will be open sourced when we fully release 1.0
Happy to answer any other questions here or at support
@_date: 2018-01-12 08:11:13
Hey there, 
You get this behavior on the "Preview your PayNym Bot" box on the main page? The preview is just a preview, technically you can hash anything and get a bot image returned. When actually adding your payment code an invalid payment code will be refused since a valid notification address will not be able to be derived from it which is used to validate ownership of the payment code. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 19:56:14
Yes, if you are sending to a non-segwit address, then by default the wallet will send change to a non-segwit change address. 
This can be disabled in the wallet settings. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 06:05:03
What was going on? Email us at support at samouraiwallet.com
@_date: 2018-01-19 19:54:35
Hey there. Samourai is Segwit by default, however we also will by default send the transaction change back to a like type output, so if you send to a normal bitcoin address the change will go back to a normal address. You can disable this in the settings. Follow the guide here 
Hope this helps. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:20:31

BIP47 is a good alternative.
We will not implement BIP70, as we see it as a slippery slope. Inviting Certificate Authorities into bitcoin to mediate transactions is a slippery slope that we have no interest in engaging in. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:27:46
Hi there. The fee rates you see on the screenshot are not hardcoded, they are the fee estimates provided by our bitcoin core nodes (or yours, if Trusted Node is setup) - of course, by pressing "custom" the user is able to add their own custom fee rate. 
This update didn't add "those fees" it just added a way for the user to visually see the current range of fee rates by confirmation urgency, and to also make it more clear that the user can enter their own custom fee as well. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 07:28:15
Samourai uses our own Bitcoin Core nodes for fee estimation or your own node if you have set up Trusted Node. As for custom fees... we've allowed users to set custom fees on transactions for a very long time, 
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:48:03
All three will work without issue, the only downside is you will pay a miner fee for the sweep and a miner fee for the spend to Trezor.
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:34:30
If you send from a P2WPKH to a P2PKH and the change goes back to a P2WPKH it is extremely easy to determine the change output(s) that belongs to the sending wallet just by looking at the transaction on the blockchain. If you are sending from P2WPKH to P2PKH and the change goes to a P2PKH it is more difficult to determine with certainty which is the destination output and which is the change output. 
As stated, the wallet will attempt whenever possible to match inputs to outputs, meaning, if you are spending to P2WPKH the wallet will attempt to choose unspents that are also P2WPKH meaning you will benefit from Segwit.
While we are a champion of the user when it comes to fees, we also are really more interested in blockchain fingerprinting, and will continue to refine along this line. In the future this behaviour may be optional (much like BIP126 can be turned off in the settings).
Thank you for the support.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:29:54
Thank you for the report and for the ping
We have identified the issue you are experiencing, and have been able to replicate on our end. As you stated, there are no loss of funds nor any risk of loss of funds, the issue is solely a display issue. Now, that is not an excuse, and we understand how scary an experience this must have been. 
We will be happy to provide you with 1-on-1 customer support just email us at support or visit us on support.samourai.io and we will discuss this case further. 
Other than that we will be working on deploying a patch for this display bug. 
Sorry for the inconvenience

@_date: 2017-12-18 23:53:01
Hey there. The amount input on the receive screen is entirely optional but can be really handy if you are generating the QR code for someone else to scan and you want to encode an amount directly into the QR (BIP21). The address of the request shouldn't be changing but the QR will change because the amount being encoded to the QR is changing. Let me know if that makes sense.
Samourai will generate a new address for every transaction. This is intentional and completely safe. The 12 words you wrote down after creating your wallet when combined with your passphrase can regenerate every single address and corresponding private key your wallet will ever create.
Hope this helps. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:25:12

We just pushed out an update that includes support for spending to bech32 encoded addresses. 
Trezor won't be too long now.
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:00:44
Hi there,
Samourai will detect the type of address you are spending to and send the change to an address that is a like type.
In your case, you spent from a P2WPKH to a P2PKH - as a result Samourai created the change output of P2PKH. The next time you go to spend to a P2PKH Samourai will spend those P2PKH utxos with preference. Creating a transaction with like types on both input and output. 
Like typed outputs is part of our ongoing work around increasing plausible deniability of bitcoin transactions on the blockchain in addition to things like BIP126 and BIP69.
Hope this helps

You can sweep any private key with our Samourai Wallet or Sentinel Watch Only app. 
But I recommend you take the advise of and rely on a well backed up seed phrase. This is much safer than a paper wallet approach.

Hey, you can do this today. 
To get the signed transaction: 
Either open Samourai Wallet without an internet connection and compose the transaction as normal and press SEND
or manually turn off transaction broadcasting
Settings &gt; Transactions &gt; Broadcast Transactions (turn off) and then attempt to create your transaction. 
You will be presented the signed transaction after pressing Send.
You can also install our proof of concept SMS relay app here  
You can paste the signed transaction from Samourai into the above app and broadcast the transaction via our SMS relay, or you can run that app on your device and act as a relay for your friends. 
Hope this helps

@_date: 2018-09-29 05:02:59
Hi Bitfroind,
Thank you for the feedback. I am not going to really disagree or counter anything you said, as it all makes sense, and are indeed factors we considered before making this change. Allow me expand a bit. 
As I noted in a previous comment, the transaction type you describe is suffering a UX loss. However, after some research and interviews with existing users we discovered this type of transaction is fairly uncommon as most users are transacting with QR codes already encoded with an amount. However, when we did find users who made those types of transactions they were usually the more advanced type who were introducing someone to Bitcoin in person (as it sounds like you do).
So, we do have a small UX loss for a group of users who 1) are generally advanced in their knowledge and 2) spread adoption not only of BTC, but of Samourai. This is a very important group of users, so we do not take this lightly. I am counting on the fact that the majority of that group will understand the reasoning (even if they disagree with the timing) and use this as an opportunity during their outreach and onboarding. For example, really making sure that your friend understands you didn't repay that beer with some sort of digital venmo dollar, but they now have a static 0.0005 BTC.
We believe this change will serve new users well. It will set expectations early and will not mislead them. We believe most existing users will not be impacted from a UX point of view (but will be impacted temporarily on a psychological level - aka not seeing the fat gainz of your BTC stash). And our gamble is that those users who are impacted, are willing to work with us and understand our long game.
Thanks again,
@_date: 2018-09-13 10:01:11
No, this encourages address reuse which is harmful for you and your counterparty. We will not implement such a feature. Instead we have implemented a privacy friendly contact list based on BIP47 called PayNyms. You can read about it here: paynym.is
Hope this helps. 
@_date: 2018-09-01 17:44:44
The only way you can guarantee you are using **your** full node is via RPC (default port 8332). 
You aren't exposing your RPC port to Samourai, nor is Samourai controlling your node. By default, Bitcoin Core will not allow exposure of the RPC interface off the local network. 
Hope this helps,
@_date: 2018-09-28 15:18:19
You worry about your wallet and we'll worry about ours. 
@_date: 2018-09-28 15:10:12
The vast majority of users pay for goods/services by scanning a BIP21 QR code. This has the amount encoded in it. The merchant is responsible for the currency conversion. The user scans the QR and presses send, just as they do now. 
So for most users there will not be a UX degradation. Now, there are some users who **will** suffer a UX loss, and those are users who tend to transact informally for example asking your friend "hey send me $50 of bitcoin". Those types of transactions will incur an extra step of determining the exchange rate, but it can be mitigated by using our watch only app Sentinel - which retains fiat conversion functionality.
However the biggest loss will be the very powerful psychological factor of opening your wallet to see the gains/loss of your BTC holdings.  This is something again you can mitigate by using Sentinel. The benefits outweigh the negatives in our view, especially for handling logistical tasks like customer support. As you know we aren't a VC funded team, we must be very conservative with how we spend our time. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:41:10
I would recommend using the Segwit address which is displayed by default. Gemini doesn't have to support segwit, as your addresses are backwards compatible. 
The benefit is, next time you go to spend you will experience less fees because you'll be spending from a segwit address. 
@_date: 2018-09-13 13:30:05
If your friends use Samourai or another compatible wallet, you can add their payment code (it begins with PM8T..) to your wallet and label it anything you wish. You can now easily send to them and even receive from them without needing to communicate addresses with each other or without revealing your entire wallet balance and history to them. 
@_date: 2015-12-19 14:11:34
If you just want to track bitcoin addresses or entire xpubs (no spending. Only receive and view) then check out [Sentinel]( It is only on Android though. 
Disclaimer: Sentinel was created and published by Samourai
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:45:55
Thanks for the feedback SpyKnife. I am the one who did all the UI stuff (admittedly it is very very sparse) I can reveal that for our 1.0 build we will introduce a theme system (dark, light, red, blue) along with clearer UI around most areas. 
Regarding the camera, it seems to be a divisive issue ;) Many people seem to say the camera is one of the best at scanning QR codes quickly. We will look into the landscape and flash to see what can be done. 
You can set custom fees already (so about clearer UI...) by tapping on the Fee rate in sat/b on the send screen. A popup will open asking for your custom fee rate. 
Thanks again

@_date: 2015-06-04 17:24:12
Yeah, as I explained in another thread, it is less than ideal, and I would probably go about it differently next time. That being said, it is an alpha product, you shouldn't absolutely trust it with your identity or privacy, as you cannot read our source code yet.  
If you are interested in a privacy conscious wallet, and are into testing bleeding edge bitcoin stuff, and helping us tweak our spending algorithms for maximum privacy on the block chain, then it is probably pretty trivial to create a sock puppet G+ account for the express purposes of testing this out. 
If not, we are hoping to open source and release 1.0 by the end of this year.
@_date: 2015-06-04 16:10:02

Thanks for the kind words. I have noted down your requests for an upcoming UI/UX update that should make a lot of these things clearer. Keep in mind, the current design of TX fee boosting is to get the transaction confirmed as quickly as possible, so it uses the current priority fee rate from either our Bitcoin Core nodes our from your own if you have setup Trusted Node.

A STONEWALL transaction mathematically disassociates inputs to outputs. Whatever you saw in whatever chain analysis platform was only a guess, and would have a relatively low confidence score. 
In any case Whirlpool will solve the issues you claim to have regarding chain analysis, as will two person STONEWALL, and other post-mix transactions. 
@_date: 2015-06-04 16:12:12
Do you have bitcoin in multiple HD Accounts on the XPUB you added? Thats the only thing I can think of that could distort the balance. We will fix this. 
And we are adding fiat values and ability to track multiple xpubs on the next release in a week or two.

@_date: 2018-08-06 13:55:42
We don't need a demo from chainalysis. We have [OXT.me]( - If you enter your txid into OXT.me you will not only see the entropy in bits of the transaction (more entropy less linkage between inputs and outputs) but you will also see the % probability of the connection between inputs and outputs.
STONEWALL TXs are always at least 1 bit of entropy and often provide probabilities of linkage between inputs/outputs around 20-40% 
Whirlpool in testing has been providing transactions with at least 10-50 bits of entropy and 0% linkage probabilities. 
@_date: 2018-05-29 08:16:41
I agree this is the correct and proper way to use Tor most effectively. 
We're working on it in conjunction with offline wallet creation and transaction signing. 
Tor will be addressed and smoothed out in time for 1.0 release of Samourai Wallet.
A private VPN is probably your best bet right now, as it can be configured independent of the wallet, and enabled before the wallet is even installed.

We 100% supported UASF. And thankfully so. UASF resulted in the activation of Segwit and the defeat of the corporate takeover attempt of Segwit2X.
We have never shilled for bits, in fact, we removed bits entirely from the wallet. No idea what you are talking about. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 12:04:35
Yes, but you have to sideload the APK to get it to activate, which usually means building from source. 
@_date: 2015-06-04 16:09:34
I know.... It was a poor decision. Basically, we wanted to run our Alpha program through the Google Play store, so that we could receive error logs and stack traces without our testers having to go through a whole ordeal. Additionally, if there was a criticial issue found it is very easy to remove that version and push a fix, if we have APKs in the wild, it can get messy. However, the whole G+ process sucks, and I am very happy to admit my mistake there. 
Once we release 1.0 we will be fully open sourced and without the crappy G+ process. My Apologies.
@_date: 2018-05-29 09:04:59
Hasn't changed yet, but will be changing very soon as part of an overall introduction to "offline" mode in the wallet. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 19:00:08
Hi there. 
We made the decision to use only one channel for Alpha distribution (Google Play, due to the relative lack of friction to participate for users, and a very valuable developer console for bug tracking and squashing) in order to avoid the issue of many different versions of the APK out there. 
There will be a direct download that corresponds with our 1.0 release - In the meantime you can build from source, which is pretty simple using Android Studio. 
@_date: 2018-05-03 16:01:02
This is the primary reason we are not out of Alpha yet. Once the Samourai server is open sourced and released fully, you will be able to run your own local instance on top of bitcoin core, and bypass our servers entirely. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 05:11:30
That is STONEWALL working ;) 
The wallet is alerting you that the transaction cannot be made into a STONEWALL transaction given the current unspents makeup. You can send anyway of course, but at least you are informed. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 21:51:19
Working on it ;)
@_date: 2018-05-03 15:56:30
Segwit ;)
@_date: 2018-08-06 15:52:12


You misunderstand. The fundamentals are, STONEWALL provides a certain level of mathematical deniability between ownership of inputs and outputs of the transaction. No matter what further analysis is added on top of that by other chain analysis platforms they all start from that base. The rest is generally social meta data leakage, and sloppy utxo selection in later transactions. 


We have not only done extensive research into other platforms, but we acquired one and the research team behind it to make our products more resilient for our users. May I remind you this is a free open source project, we haven't taken VC investment and do not have some lavish R&amp;D budget. Feel free to do the research and contribute here though: 


That is fine

They are pushing BCH usage and trying to discourage BTC usage with the penilization fee. 
There is nothing *we* need to do to help them, they are making a very conscience choice for very specific politically motivated reasons.
Instead of emailing Bitpay, email the merchant and help educate on other, much more fair, payment processors. :)
@_date: 2018-05-04 06:54:06
You can't lose your money. When you created the wallet you were given 12 words to write down. Using these words in combination with your passphrase will restore your funds in a compatible wallet.
Email support and someone will help you out.

Alpha is going very smooth, not a lot of bugs to take care of, leaving more time to feature development according to our internal (and external) roadmap. If things continue to progress smoothly we will be Open Sourcing sooner than we thought. Thanks for the support.
@_date: 2015-05-08 23:32:12
Hi there! That is a fair point. However, keep in mind we are not a web wallet, and offer nothing of any value on our website other than information about the product we are building. We are open sourcing our code once we conclude closed beta. 
@_date: 2015-05-10 19:39:14
we have an idea for that too, but lets not get ahead of ourselves :)
@_date: 2015-05-09 10:24:39
It depends where you are from I guess. Samourai is the French spelling :)
@_date: 2015-05-08 23:30:12
the passphrase is part of the seed generated
@_date: 2015-05-26 16:13:37
This is a serious issue. Today Samourai Wallet added a Secure Uninstall feature, inspired by this article. When a user chooses to uninstall the wallet, or they perform a remote wipe command, the app space will be overwritten 1000 times with random data, which should make retrieving any information much more difficult if not impossible to retrieve. 
@_date: 2015-05-09 11:05:59
Thanks caveden
The coins are fully controlled by the user at all times. The private keys are stored encrypted on the device and are never communicated to any servers.
There currently is not a multi-sig feature, mostly because Samourai is designed to a mobile street wallet, but we see multi-sig as a tool in our back pocket to create some really interesting features down the road.
@_date: 2015-05-08 23:36:27
Samourai is an SPV mobile wallet that collects no information about you. Our source code will be fully open sourced and public once we leave closed beta. We are currently utilising a single API for balance lookups and transaction pushing, but plan to use separate API's for each of those tasks as per the recommendation of the Open Bitcoin Privacy Project.
As for the block explorer, we feel you, but people like to view transactions in a block explorer sometimes, so we at least give you the option to choose your favourite. IP leaking is something we are working on solving right now :)
Thank you for the detailed questions!
@_date: 2015-05-09 18:37:34
Good questions! First and foremost I personally would be very wary of installing any bitcoin wallet on a rooted device, as there are way too many attack vectors. Even the best encryption can be thwarted by a simple keylogger attack. 
That being said...
The PIN can be between 5-8 characters and is not stored anywhere on the device ever. You are prompted for your PIN and upon successful entry the payload is decrypted. 
Samourai payload is encrypted with the AES256 of PIN + secret value. The secret value is a randomly generated GUID that is stored on the device in the Android app settings. (Therefore GUID is theoretically attackable on a rooted device)
Because of this we are recommending not trusting a rooted device with your bitcoins, but are interested in any and all solutions to this. (multi-sig is potentially a good option for the future, for example)
Thanks! These kinds of questions are important for the development of the product. 
@_date: 2015-05-10 09:59:25
We have been looking into Orbot support
@_date: 2015-05-17 13:43:09
Thanks again for your feedback. We are implementing a soft keyboard with randomized key layout on the PIN Entry screen in Alpha 2. We still need to explore the screen recording attack vector but, hopefully the keylogging vector on rooted devices is mitigated. 
@_date: 2016-01-24 07:48:25
Hi there. You can email support 
From experience with other requests like this:
When you are restoring your wallet by 12 mnemonic please make sure that you enter the passphrase you defined when you created the wallet in the field labelled 'BIP 39 Passphrase'. This passphrase essentially turns your 12 word mnemonic into a 13 word mnemonic, so if the passphrase is wrong, even by a character, you won't see an error you'll just see a zero balance. 
Contact support if you need any more help!
@_date: 2017-02-13 18:01:18
Sorry about that. We got it back up as quickly as possible, should be stable now. 
@_date: 2015-05-09 01:14:20
Hey, thanks for the feedback. I think it's more than likely we'll bring in more exchange prices and let the user choose (like we do with block explorers). For our Alpha product we felt it was fitting to draw our prices from the most reliable place to buy and sell bitcoin anonymously.
Thanks again! 
@_date: 2017-03-22 18:12:32
Please note we are still Alpha software and we are not fully reliant on our own back-end and do unfortunately rely on 3rd party API's still. This is planned to be fully replaced Q2 2017 - and until that time you should only use Samourai to help us test and provide feedback to help shape the 1.0 release. 
@_date: 2016-01-23 06:27:45
I'm sure or would be happy to explain further. 
@_date: 2015-05-08 23:27:06
Our wallet enforces the use of a BIP 39 Passphrase when you create your wallet. This means we can relay your HD seed over SMS without worry. Your HD seed is worthless without your passphrase.
@_date: 2016-01-23 04:34:09
Yes but on mobile, and indistinguishable from any other bitcoin transaction on the network
@_date: 2016-01-22 23:08:35
edit: meant to respond to BIP 47 basically gives you a permanent address that you can safely and privately reuse and share publicly. 
For example, You and I share payment codes with each other. At any point in time after that I can choose to send BTC to you and vice-versa, no need for us to communicate addresses to each other any more. 
This can be used to create an in wallet 'address book' of sorts that doesn't reuse addresses or compromise privacy of either the sender or the recipient among other cool uses.
@_date: 2017-02-13 17:59:50
We agree. 
No reason why they can't implement this feature. Pressure your favorite wallets to implement BIP47
@_date: 2017-03-22 18:16:16
Yes indeed. We are aware of this risk, but we decided the SPV risk (especially before this proposal) was greater than the risk of physical invasion. In any case it is a very valid point, which is part of the reason we are building out the Trusted Node feature that once fully implemented will allow users, and even encourage users, to avoid Samourai servers altogether to setup a node of their own.
@_date: 2017-03-14 18:45:53
Hi there,
Please see this comment from Samourai Lead Dev 
@_date: 2017-03-18 06:52:43
Hi Mashuri, 
Just wanted to let you know we fixed the greyed out checkbox bug. If you install the latest version, re-add your trusted node. The checkmark will work. 
Thanks for the help
@_date: 2017-03-14 18:52:00
Hi Mashuri, 
Take a look at the instructions here: 
Short of it is, add the following to bitcoin.conf and restart bitcoin:








You need to be on the same network as the node for it to work by default. Otherwise you need to whitelist a static IP address (from a VPN for example)
Whitelist your static IP with:


Edit: If you do add a whitelisted IP you might need to open port 8332 on your router for that IP address, though I've seen it open automatically on some routers. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 05:07:08
I'm not sure that the greyed out checkbox is behaving as intended right now. If you saw the toast saying successful connection and the node version then it is indeed set up. 
If you tried to send while off of your trusted VPN it wouldn't work. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 18:42:46
You can connect to a trusted node in p2p mode (port 8333) using Schildbach Wallet (Android) and GreenBits (Android).
Samourai Trusted node connects directly to the bitcoin-rpc (port 8332). I am not familiar with any other mobile wallets that connect directly via port 8332. 
As we state on  by default bitcoin-rpc is only available on the local network for security reasons. In order to use this feature outside of your local network you must whitelist a static IP (for instance from a VPN). We will soon be releasing a tutorial intended for advanced users who wish to configure their own VPN server they can use to connect to their Trusted Node. Additionally, in a future update support for your nodes running as a Tor hidden service will also be introduced. 
^And ^for ^the ^usual ^disclaimer:
^Samourai ^is ^Alpha ^software. ^During ^this ^state ^of ^our ^development ^we ^are ^still ^relying ^on ^third ^party ^API's ^for ^UTXO's ^and ^balances ^which ^may ^degrade ^your ^privacy. ^We ^expect ^to ^be ^completely ^off ^of ^any ^3rd ^party ^API's ^in ^Q2 ^2017. ^In ^the ^meantime ^samourai ^will ^remain ^Alpha ^software
@_date: 2017-03-22 13:52:04
Samourai is not an SPV wallet. By default Samourai will communicate with our Bitcoin Core nodes hosted in Iceland. We have stated previously that we will not be changing from Bitcoin Core. Additionally users may connect to their own hosted nodes using our 'Trusted Node' feature. However it is worth noting that the wallet will throw an error if you attempt to connect a trusted node that breaks current consensus (Classic, BU, XT, etc...)
Unlike some of the other wallets we have no problem choosing sides. We fully back Bitcoin Core now, and will continue to do so in the case of a hard fork. 
Hope this helps. 
As for this PR we support it wholeheartedly and are continually impressed with Core contributors and Luke-jr in particular. 
@_date: 2017-03-22 14:18:17
I do not think we are as of yet. Thank you for this suggestion. I am tagging here for future reference. 


Very clever. I do not see why this or similar checks cannot be implemented into our 1.0 release. 
We really appreciate the feedback 
@_date: 2016-01-23 04:52:51
It doesn't. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 19:28:37
I haven't tested it specifically but I cannot see why it wouldn't work if you run the python script in share/rpcuser and append the string to your configuration file. 
I can't test it right now, but if you do please let me know the results. If it works i'll add it to the 'advanced' tutorial I am working on. 
@_date: 2017-03-15 07:33:15
Cool! You should definitely set up a full node. 
As you expect there will be a problem trying to use a home node on a dynamic IP (most mobile connections). This can be solved by using a VPN connection and whitelisting that IP within the node config.
We will be publishing a short tutorial soon for people who want to set up a trusted node at home and use it on the go.
Thanks for the feedback
@_date: 2017-03-14 18:45:14
Where possible we will be introducing on-demand permission control. Allowing the user to accept and deny permissions requests as they occur. However this isn't a priority until we are closer to a full release as you say. 
Thanks a bunch for the feedback and support :)
@_date: 2017-03-15 07:24:26
SSL support was disabled a little while ago and is [discouraged](
The client cert is something we are looking in to. It just increases the complexity of the setup process. 
Thanks for the feedback!
@_date: 2017-03-17 06:29:44
The "use trusted node" being greyed out seems to be a bug on certain devices. Pay no attention to that. If Samourai is returning the correct node version then Trusted Node is setup. 
We are looking into the "use trusted node" display issue
@_date: 2015-05-26 16:50:00
This is a serious issue. Today Samourai Wallet added a Secure Uninstall feature, inspired by this article. When a user chooses to uninstall the wallet, or they perform a remote wipe command, the app space will be overwritten 1000 times with random data, which should make retrieving any information much more difficult if not impossible to retrieve.
@_date: 2017-03-15 07:25:09
If it confirmed connection then it is on. Next transaction sent should indicate it was sent through trusted node. Thanks for the tests I'll include it in the documentation!
@_date: 2019-03-11 08:54:38
Hi there, 
Implementing a reliable and native Tor layer within the app (as opposed to relying on an often unreliable external app as we do today) is a prerequisite to connecting to and communicating with your own full node and utilizing all of its functionality (aka, bypassing our servers entirely) which is what GMax is addressing in your first link. 
The source code for the Dojo software will be released as part of the Samourai Wallet 1.0 release, which will only be when the user can bypass our servers, which requires a native and reliable Tor layer in the wallet.
@_date: 2018-10-25 12:53:54
You'd notice. [There is an alert when the wallet encounters a potential tracer](
@_date: 2018-10-25 15:07:32
Alert triggers for anything under 0.00001 BTC
@_date: 2017-08-27 23:15:16
We will not consider segwit2x support in any way shape or form. We would consider the chain as you describe it as invalid and would continue to run Bitcoin Core backing nodes.
We see segwit2x as a firm attack on the bitcoin network and do not condone backroom deals as a way to push forward development of the bitcoin protocol. 
We are very happy with the quality of code and the responsible conservative releases made by the Bitcoin Core team, and cannot see any reason why we would pull our support from them.  
@_date: 2017-01-20 19:53:31
We won't leave Alpha status until we do not rely on 3rd party API's anymore which we are very close to. Currently we push TX's from our own trusted nodes in Iceland but we still use chain.so and BC.i for balance lookups and UTXOs. We have our own back-end solution in development (also in Iceland) which is a requirement before Beta status. 
Beta in addition to no 3rd party API's **will** contain a mixing/tumbling solution. It will be a premium transaction type for Samourai but will also share characteristics of incentive structures like JoinMarket. We must keep details sparse for competitive advantage, but we will open source this solution just like we have for Samourai Wallet (ricochet included).

@_date: 2017-01-20 20:55:11
As Dev said, we have modifications in the works that will lessen the fingerprint. But also to keep in mind that a blanket ban like that would also return a lot more false positives which would impact their ability to sell their lists. 
@_date: 2018-10-10 10:50:59
Actually you don't need the goTenna app at all, just any wallet that can produce a signed transaction hex (Samourai and Trezor afaik) and the txTenna app. 
You can pair your goTenna mesh device directly to txTenna app
@_date: 2017-08-14 14:20:08
Thank you for this and (and all the others who helped contribute to this project)
The research is great. However I hope it is realised that with both Samourai Wallet and Hidden Wallet committed to **implementing** the ZeroLink framework, users will have the ability to mix their own coins trustlessly and be assured their privacy will not be lost due to post mix wallet transgressions on both android and desktop platform in the very near future. 
This is a R&amp;D win, but also a practical win which will result in tangible benefits for end users. We're happy you reached out to us to work on this with you. Privacy is team work and we're happy to contribute to this project with you. 
@_date: 2018-10-17 08:29:20
No one was deceived. We were very clear about the wallet architecture to our users during that time period. I am not sure why you are targeting us, but I can see that trying to reason with you will not be worthwhile. Have a good day.

Hey, iOS is an actual goal at some point in the (hopefully) near future.
Fiat coming back is just simply dead on arrival
@_date: 2017-08-27 20:06:32
We are not neutral. We are 100% emotionally, politically and technically opposed to bcash and any future attacks on the bitcoin network. If you are looking for a middle of the road fence sitting position you should look to another wallet. 
I understand if taking a position makes you uncomfortable in an age when everyone is dancing around on eggshells trying to avoid offense, but you will come to appreciate our honesty and candor. 
Good luck out there.
@_date: 2017-08-14 15:47:20
Hi there. Yes indeed it has. 3rd party API's have been removed (with the exception of exchange rates) and replaced with our own self hosted custom software. The backend server has not yet been open sourced, but it will be in the near future. The wallet app itself is of course open source and can be examined here:

We will add this as an advanced feature in an upcoming build :)
@_date: 2017-08-27 19:08:04
Of course. Just as it was with BCH. You are in control of your private keys, therefore you can export your private keys into any other wallet that supports the fork coins . Just don't expect us to support it. 
@_date: 2018-10-06 09:23:38
Hey there, 
Sorry to hear you had this experience. Next time shoot us an email on support and we'll get you squared away. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 20:46:01
No real disagreement here. We chose non SPV for better performance for our users, the fact we wouldn't blindly follow longest chain, among other reasons around future feature considerations. 
We are well aware of the privacy trade offs, which is the primary reason why we have 1) enabled Tor/VPN support very early on and 2) have prioritized the Trusted Node feature, which we hope to flesh out to the point where Samourai can act as a nice mobile GUI for your Bitcoin Core node at home if that is what you choose.
Additionally, we plan on open sourcing our back-end API before 1.0 release so that any user may run their own instance of the Samourai-API server locally.
We really appreciate your feedback over the last few years of development and hope to continue to receive it in the future. 
Thanks 
@_date: 2017-08-27 22:46:28
Yes we're open source:

In case it wasn't clear, the Original Post is from Feb 2016
- In Feb 2016 Samourai Wallet was not available openly from the Google Play store, instead you needed to join a private Google+ Community and be manually approved by me.
- Within that community (of around 200 people iirc) issues, bugs, and feedback was collected and reviewed.
- All users in the community were aware we were using BC.i APIs for balance lookups and pushing tx's 
- All users were aware that using those APIs were a temporary measure. 
- We listed "end reliance on 3rd party APIs" as a TODO to cross off the list on our public website. ( 
- **No user was ever deceived, and we have not ever received a complaint like that from an actual Alpha 1 user from this time period**
For a long time now there has been no 3rd party APIs used in Samourai Wallet. However, there still remains the issue that users must trust our nodes to report correct information. This is the one issue we have not yet resolved, and the reason we still classify ourselves as "Alpha" - We hope to present our resolution to this issue by the end of the year. 
I hope this helps clear any misconceptions up. 
@_date: 2016-12-16 22:05:42
@_date: 2017-01-20 21:02:04
It's nothing personal against the devs, we just disagree with KYC in the bitcoin wallet. It is something we will not compromise on, and think there is a sizeable portion of the market who will appreciate that.
@_date: 2017-08-03 14:35:34
Do you plan on updating the repository any time soon? We are advising our users to use Coinomi if they require access to their BCH, though we may need to revisit that policy if you aren't planning on bringing your repository up to date. Thanks.
(BTW Trezor updated their trezor-core repository and many other repositories within the last 24 hours, so they are indeed keeping their repository up to date)
@_date: 2016-12-22 17:29:24
Are there any plans to implement [BIP47]( (Reusable Payment Codes) into the wallet? Seems like CoPay would be a great test bed. 
@_date: 2018-10-03 06:27:14
@_date: 2016-11-24 03:19:05
Yeah good point. Perhaps more simply just say the number of signalling blocks in that period.
@_date: 2016-11-23 06:41:28
Good idea. 95% is needed for lock-in.
@_date: 2018-10-25 14:35:56
You can mark them as spendable again at anytime. While they are not spendable they will not be used for composing transactions nor will they be reflected in your balance. 
@_date: 2016-11-22 17:13:18
Good idea. Added to to-do
@_date: 2016-12-16 19:32:50
Thanks for the shout out.
As stated deeper in a comment thread. We are indeed working on mobile mixing/tumbling solution, but that will not be ready for testing until the new year. 
We are planning an update next week introducing new functionality that currently doesn't exist (as far as we can tell) in any other wallet. We believe it will be a thorn in the side of the analytics companies (though we readily acknowledge that will always be a case of cat and mouse), and provide some level of privacy that currently isn't available in mobile wallets today. 
Edit: Yes, we're [open source](

Thanks for the response guys. We personally use your multisig solution at Samourai and we appreciate all the work you have done. 
As you know has implemented BIP47 in Samourai Wallet and has [open sourced generic code]( for BIP47 to make it easier for other wallets to implement. I know he has been thinking about BIP47 + multisig - so perhaps there is some conversations we can have.

If you are on Android then Sentinel is what you are looking for: 
@_date: 2016-12-18 12:54:46
Not sure what you mean? Shapeshift.io was in the wallet since Alpha 2. We removed ShapeShift a few weeks back in an optimisation update since we weren't making any money on it (indicating no one was using it), and we weren't particularly thrilled by the public API end point for log collection. 
@_date: 2018-06-20 21:29:24
Of course we supported UASF - I think we were the first to publicly do so. 100% stand by that and would do it again if we had to. 
@_date: 2016-11-22 20:06:47
Sorry it isn't clear but the 2016 Blocks is in this targeting period. We're pulling the data directly from the API endpoint that sipa has provided [here](
Based on other suggestions in this thread, we'll update to make targeting periods clearer.

Samourai is available as an unreleased Alpha.
You can install it onto your Android phone by going here:
We're still a little bit away from a fully released version, but the Alpha version is stable enough to be used as a full time mobile wallet.
@_date: 2018-10-25 13:03:48
The "contaminated" utxo wouldn't move, thus not compromising/contaminating other utxos in the wallet when they are later spent together (merging inputs). 
@_date: 2016-12-16 19:20:08
Our wallet is available as an Alpha today here:

We are indeed working on a mobile shuffle/mixing solution but unfortunately that won't be ready until the new year. Up until now we have focused on **obfuscation** - pioneering the idea of decoy change addresses and coinjoin simulation, being the first and only to implement [BIP 126]( and being the first and only to implement [BIP47](
Next week we are planning to release an update that improves Tor support in the wallet and introduces another new privacy technique that can sit *in between* the process of acquiring KYC coins and tumbling those coins. 
Hope this helps. 
@_date: 2016-11-22 16:37:55
All really cool suggestions, especially the first one. Will look into this for the next update. 
@_date: 2019-06-02 16:15:04
There is no other wallet that contains the type of transaction analysis busting techniques that we do. Sorry, that is a fact. When it comes to transactional privacy, Samourai leaves everyone else in the dust. And now with Dojo, your previous concern trolling (where you conflate network privacy with transaction privacy, even though you "are technical enough" to know better) is completely moot. Thanks.
**TX Types in Samourai Wallet TODAY:**
* STONEWALL - Mathematically simulates a CoinJoin using your UTXO set
* STONEWALLx2 - A mini 2 person CoinJoin. Mix as you spend.
* Stowaway/PayJoin - A 2 person CoinJoin that appears to be a "simple spend" that satisfies the most basic analysis heuristics, polluting their datasets. 
**Coming in a few weeks on mobile, but available on desktop today:**
* Whirlpool - Chaumian CoinJoin severs the link between the UTXOs you put in and get out.
Feel free to audit your transactions (or any other ones) using tools that we developed and made available to people like you for free:
* [KYCP.org](
* [OXT.me](
* [Boltzmann (Python)](
* [Boltzmann (Java)](
@_date: 2016-11-23 14:58:56
Yeah sorry about that. Should be all cleared up now. 
@_date: 2019-06-02 17:18:36
1) Appeal to authority
2) Everything has already been responded to, multiple times, on reddit and on twitter.
You're responding to a thread about the open sourcing of our back end with allegations and complaints of our back end not being open sourced.
@_date: 2019-06-02 16:54:00
I'm sorry but I am extremely careful with my words precisely because I do not wish to mislead. I take exception to your claim that we are misleading or exaggerating. Show me where, make your argument, and if I have mislead I will retract and apologise. 
You comment regarding CoinJoin is irrelevant. The Whirlpool coordinator is blinded and when used in combination with Dojo is just as private as a "decentralized" CoinJoin, the only one of which I know is JoinMarket, and that is hardly a wallet. 
Additionally, CoinJoin isn't the be all end all, the wallet must have an appropriate post-join spending strategy to prevent users from merging inputs that will degrade privacy for all participants, no other wallet has those tools but Samourai. 
I stand wholly by the claim that Samourai is the most private bitcoin wallet on the market. Primarily from a Tx analysis point of view, and now with Dojo, even on the network analysis side. 
Sorry for being curt, but I don't appreciate being slapped, even if you are wearing a smile while doing it.
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:41:54
We really appreciate the support. Thanks Bitcoin_Bug and everyone else who sent a donation or who has taken the time to install, test, run, and champion our wallet. It means a lot. We're just ramping up now, a lot more exciting things to come. Stay tuned...
@_date: 2019-06-02 16:25:14
Yes Samourai Wallet supports OpenDime - You can either read the balance, or if you break the seal on the OD, you can sweep the balance into your wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:29:33
Fee customisation on RBF/CPFP is forthcoming. Sending to bech32 addresses is in active testing right now, so shouldn't be much longer. Thanks!
@_date: 2015-08-30 07:58:45


This is a good idea, will explore refining the fee process further into a more simplified workflow. Thanks a lot.
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:49:48
Yes, the keys are only ever stored on the device and never communicated externally.
@_date: 2015-08-24 07:30:34
(please excuse the late reply, I just saw this thread) 
Under certain circumstances the wallet user may choose to have the wallet create a number of decoy change addresses in a single transaction. If the user chooses to do this then in subsequent transactions those decoy change outputs will not be used together in the same transaction. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:39:21
Sometime next year if all goes well, that's all I can say now!
@_date: 2017-11-21 08:35:33
Hey Cassius, 
Great to hear you are considering  Samourai Wallet. We're not about the hard-sell and think it is great you are doing research and asking around. In case you aren't aware the android wallet is open source software available to view and review here:  and we are expected to leave our alpha state around the end of this year. 
Some good resources that should answer your questions around privacy,backup/restore processes, and everything else  can be found here:  and of course can reach support via livechat at the same link or by emailing support
Good luck in your research!
@_date: 2015-08-04 20:56:26
- Start by sending a small amount to your trezor. Confirm everything went okay.
- Go through the restore sequence go make sure you can access the funds in the case of a lost device.
- Use an app like [Sentinel]( (disclosure, this app is created by me) or [myTrezorLite]( to easily keep track of your wallet balance and generate new deposit addresses. Both these apps cannot send bitcoin, and are only useful as a read-only application
@_date: 2015-08-30 07:56:21
Hi there! Thanks for the kind words and questions. This will certainly help us refine our message and make things less confusing. 
**Auto Fee** - We get the calculated fee using the size of the transaction (among other things) and then add a small amount extra to speed confirmations up. Generally this fee hovers around 0.0001 BTC . With Auto fee we want to make sure the transaction confirms quickly under normal conditions. (sadly using purely fee per kb has very inconsistent confirmation times)
**Priority Fee** - When the network is stressed, the mempool reaches a certain threshold, and some other triggers the user will be notified in the app and prompted to send with a Priority Fee. The Priority fee is calculated by looking at the mempool, seeing how much of a backlog there is, and determining how much would be required to ensure transactions are confirmed within three blocks. 
**Custom Fee** - The user enters their own fee.
I doubt there is much out there on Google about CoinJoin Simulation considering we invented it. However I am pretty sure Kristov Atlas of the Open Bitcoin Privacy Project is supposedly writing a BIP that formalizes the CoinJoin Simulation process.
Essentially, if the wallet is able to, AND the user opts in. Samourai can build transactions that are visually indistinguishable from a standard CoinJoin send. This transaction will be composed entirely of inputs and outputs in your own wallet.
Samourai does intend to have a native mixing solution by next release, this is just a stop gap :)
iOS - yes, but we are just two guys, with full time day jobs. We are  passionate about bitcoin and our product, and will continue developing it as long as we can, but from a resources level iOS is completely out of reach at this point, but it is on our long term roadmap!
Thanks so much for the questions. Let me know if I can clear anything else up 
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:35:25
Thanks FA985, I'm not sure if you know, but you can set a custom fee when sending from Samourai Wallet. Just tap on the sat/B label and enter your own custom amount in sat/B  :)
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:37:26
Right now we are solely focused on a single wallet experience... With the exception of hardware peripherals like our OpenDime support and our upcoming Trezor support. Once we feel we have locked down the feature set and have the UI/UX (remember we're still Alpha, and the UI/UX still has some way to go) right we'll look at scaling out to multiple wallets. 
Thanks for the questions!
@_date: 2015-08-29 13:30:53
We are in private alpha currently, but [Samourai Wallet]( allows the user to define their own custom fee, apply a dynamic priority fee (depending on the current state of the mempool etc.) in addition to an 'auto' fee 
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:29:43
@_date: 2019-06-18 05:01:09
That UI is currently being tested internally and will be rolled out to users as soon as possible. I personally think that is when we will see heavy usage. 
The desktop mixing client for Whirlpool is more designed for users who wish to remain in the mixing pool for extended periods of time (the longer you keep your utxos in the pool, the more they are mixed at no additional cost to you) - While on mobile, it will be a more bursty on demand kind of interaction (I need to mix now).
Finding the balance between enough "liquidity providers" who are mixing via the desktop client hoping to score some free mixes, and "on demand mixers" who are paying a small fee to enter the pool and mix funds as quickly as possible will be the real task here. 
Thanks for the support!
@_date: 2019-04-27 08:13:27
Very good analogy.
@_date: 2016-02-05 02:04:57
In the next alpha update (with the headline feature of BIP 47 support) there are a number of changes in the way balances are looked up and transactions pushed to the network. Chain.so is used way more than just as a block explorer. 
Readers should keep in mind Samourai is an Alpha software and is continually updating and improving all aspects of our offering, especially privacy. 
@_date: 2016-02-03 19:50:15
Yes we have taken the feedback in this thread and will be changing the way our canary works, we appreciate the heads up.
@_date: 2016-02-05 01:47:11
These kind of posts encourage me. If we weren't scaring the shit out of someone we wouldn't see these posts. These aren't a concerns of a privacy minded bitcoin user, which I am happy to engage in positive discourse with,these are the concerns of someone who is getting uncomfortable with a bitcoin wallet showing signs of success with a message of privacy no one ever thought can grow at scale.
I won't spend too much time on this because frankly this is trolls trolling trolls and we have tons of work to do.
1) yes we do use BC.i API's
2) We also use various other API's (chain.so being one). Balance lookup and push TX and various other operations use various API providers. As we mentioned the day we launched on reddit and in our private testing group we used these APIs to bootstrap our service. Almost every single service you use in the bitcoin space touches or has touched these APIs in some way.
3) This is the primary reason we chose to make VPN and Tor support a priority in Alpha development.
4) We have been working on our own backend solution to bring us off of third party API's as much as possible. This is also right on our website as a goal.
5) We have been open in dialogue with the Open Bitcoin Privacy Project who publishes an annual report on bitcoin wallet privacy including ratings. Users will be able to read this report and gain this information themselves.
tl;dr - much ado about nothing, if you don't like it don't use it.
@_date: 2016-02-03 16:00:46
That is the current scope of the directive right now. Based on past actions we expect them to broaden the scope of this directive eventually. 
@_date: 2016-02-03 15:05:52
Correct. 
We are based (loosely) in the UK. If the UK remains in the EU AND this EU directive comes into practise then that is exactly what we will do. 
@_date: 2016-02-05 02:09:05
No because you don't have the APK yet as it hasn't been pushed yet. 
Feel free to decompile once it is released or just wait until we open source. 
@_date: 2017-04-11 09:09:07
Useful. Thank you.
@_date: 2016-02-03 14:32:41
@_date: 2016-02-03 14:35:47
Thats a fair point. However there are other contingencies to this:
1) We know nothing about you and do not want to know anything about you. 
2) If we decided to start caring about KYC/AML it would become fairly evident in the wallet and we'd expect all of our users to stop using the wallet. 
3) If we are ever forced to do something under duress that we may not agree with our [warrant canary]( would disappear 
@_date: 2016-02-05 07:32:10
We have been commenting throughout this thread and we wrote a post as well. Thanks. 
@_date: 2016-02-03 14:32:11
Our wallet is in Closed Alpha currently. That means you specifically have to opt in to use it. We have been completely open that we aren't planning to open source our code until we are extremely close to a 1.0 release. We estimate that date to be in March as is stated on our website. 
We completely understand if people do not want to use the wallet until it is open source, that is okay. But we are asking for people to help test the wallet in the real world. We have over 400 users who have opted in to testing the wallet and not one of them will ever say we stole their funds, because that simply isn't true or possible. 
@_date: 2016-02-03 15:07:04
Yeah because targeting a market that has a history of blowing themselves up (and therefore ceasing to be a participant in the market) is a solid business decision. 
@_date: 2016-02-05 07:35:27


This was our understanding as well, however we will look into this further.
As for HTTPS we really didn't think about it because the website doesn't serve anything but static marketing content, though we will probably add it to avoid awkward situations like this in the future. Thanks. 
@_date: 2016-02-05 02:11:39
Okay. 
@_date: 2016-02-05 02:44:44
Hi Greg,


What announcement? The off hand tweet someone posted here? I just want to make sure that we are looking at the same thing. 
The findings here we aren't refuting, and never were hiding it either. From day one we have highlighted - mostly within our alpha group discussion group, but also there is a mention on our website - the need to move off third party API's - not only due to privacy concerns but also the increased downtime we were experiencing due to no fault of our own. Indeed, this is part of the reason we are not publicly available in the Google Play store today instead behind an "opt-in" testing path.


I think it would be unethical to release a 1.0 Samourai that is closed source and this information not disclosed. I however do not see an ethical problem at all in highlighting our goals (better privacy) and actively working to achieve those goals by releasing a series of testing builds. If any of our testers feel that we have been unethical in our practises I would like to sincerely apologise and work to rectify that. 


I believe that was in the context of requiring KYC/AML, but yes overall the point stands.


Yes a closed source alpha testing wallet. Yes it relies on a third party API (in the build being discussed BC.i is the sole API source, in an upcoming build we separate address balances from transaction pushing). I wasn't aware I needed to disclose this piece of technical information on a reddit thread about a tweet I made regarding KYC/AML in Bitcoin. This isn't the first time this has come up, we aren't hiding it, but granted this is the first time you are bringing it up, which means that you are looking at our wallet, which is awesome. Thanks.


That is a fair point and one we will need to improve upon. Thank you. 


You know better than anyway that talk is cheap, code is what matters. We aren't making money on this, we aren't getting paid for this, we do this because we believe in it. So I hope to prove you wrong when you say we are already showing we won't do the right thing. 
Appreciate the criticism and suggestions from someone we respect so much. 
@_date: 2016-02-05 01:51:32
@_date: 2016-02-03 15:54:11


I mean they figuratively could, but we aren't in the US so that would be a pretty big stretch.


Cool so do I




Every transaction you make, "your history", is permanently recorded in the block chain. You can't undo that. If you have a problem with that, Samourai isn't your problem, Bitcoin is.


Admittedly, the canary isn't perfect, but it is a method employed by a variety of companies across the spectrum to be able to communicate information with their users in way that complies within the law.  
@_date: 2017-04-02 08:28:40
We would have loved to attend this. Unfortunately we didn't see any advanced notice of this event taking place. Looking forward to the outcome of this event.

We acknowledged yesterday that there may potential flaws in the canary process we decided upon and will be looking into making changes that make sense. Thanks!
@_date: 2016-02-05 04:05:11
fwiw - we do plan on open sourcing when we have 1.0 product (we are still in alpha) and we do plan on making money. 
@_date: 2016-02-03 15:41:10


No idea, not really sure why that matters. And will matter far less once we open source. We write code. Our code is written in such a way that we do not and cannot know or store information on our users, how people use the code that we write is not something that we can regulate or enforce.


I was speaking in hypotheticals, but you missed my point entirely. If for some reason we decided to completely abandon our entire mission and goals and start requiring ID to use the wallet it wouldn't be a matter of "checking our blog", it would be completely evident in the software, you would literally see it in front of your face when using the wallet. And you would likely leave.


The canary requires two pgp signatures once a month to remain active. If both signatures aren't available for signing the canary expires without us breaking current laws and actively proclaiming "We were subpoena'd and are not suppose to tell you this?". 
Hope this helps!
 
@_date: 2016-02-03 19:54:38
Or we are able to look at past behaviour of EU directives and we see that regulations like this rarely stay narrow in scope and can eventually expand to impact wallet providers. 
@_date: 2017-04-10 05:17:37
FYI: In Segwit there is a new version bit in the block header. SPV clients should be able to tell SW active chain from the invalid one. SPV clients should be able to only accept blocks with that version bit.
Thank you for your concerns.
@_date: 2016-02-03 16:04:31
Thank you. 
We of course would prefer to not sit in a jail cell, and thats why instead we focus on software solutions that make directives like this nothing more than hot air from Brussels. When we say we rather sit in jail than comply with kyc/aml in bitcoin we mean Samourai Wallet doesn't compromise, and we will not allow that outcome to occur, and we sincerely mean that. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 15:11:49
Hi, make sure you send us a message to support and we will get you squared away. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:22:41
We are working on an iOS wallet, but is correct, it will likely be a very watered down version of the flagship Samourai Wallet  on Android. We'll see what we can do on iOS and we'll do it well, but users who want the full experience will need Android. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 09:30:20
Yes that is possible with Samourai Wallet today. Users can create a signed transaction QR code. An online Samourai user can scan that QR code and broadcast the transaction. 
@_date: 2019-01-04 16:11:43
Just FYI - Stowaway isn't released yet, we're still testing (hence testnet) but initial results are very promising. We're hoping to release very soon. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 23:03:20
It is being worked on. We have enough resources for one iOS dev to join our team, and we found the perfect guy recently so it will take some time. It is being worked on though.
Would you be willing to write a tutorial on the bootable android USB, I imagine may people would be interested. 
@_date: 2019-01-04 16:17:13
This would be useful way to spend the utxos that you have mixed with Wasabi, Whirlpool, or JoinMarket. 
It is essentially a mini CoinJoin with just two participants, that looks like a normal transaction (no fingerprint) and has the nice side benefit of masking the true amount spent. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 16:26:38
Hey there,
When we first created Samourai, Android did not have run-time permissions. We are looking at rehauling the permissions management before 1.0 release to add run-time permissions where ever we can. 
Until then you can read about the permissions we do request and why here: 
Hope this helps,

Hello there! I think the most bulletproof way to safeguard from the attack vector you describe is to 
1) audit the code within the github repo or have someone you trust audit it
2) build the code that you have audited from source. This way you know without questions that the code you are running is the code you are viewing on Github.
Building from source isn't that difficult using Android Studio, so if this is something you wanted to do, it would be fairly trivial to get it all setup.
ON github [releases page](
PGP signed (by tagged releases correspond to builds that were issued via Google Play.
We will look into deterministic builds, but later after 1.0 rolls out. 
Hope this helps.

This is correct. Balances are still being retrieved by our own nodes. Trusted Node is used today for broadcasting your transactions to the network and verifying proof of work on incoming headers. We are working on expanding the functionality of Trusted Node and users can expect considerable investment in our Trusted Node feature in the future. 
Once we open source our back-end layer to correspond with our official release, users who are concerned about the privacy loss of interacting with our Nodes can instead bypass our servers entirely and rely on their own local copy of the Samourai back-end.
Hope this helps, 
@_date: 2017-10-15 07:07:48
Hi, sorry for the confusion and misunderstanding, it is easy to lose conversations and nuance on Twitter. 
Samourai is not a SPV wallet in the way Breadwallet is, meaning Samourai Wallets do not connect directly to the blockchain. Samourai Wallets connect to our custom layer running on top of Bitcoin Core 0.15. This back-end layer will be made available to the community with an open source license before we release version 1.0 of Samourai. 
By default our back-end nodes verify PoW via header readings. If the user has setup their own Trusted Node then the client app verifies the headers using their own node. 
I am not sure what you mean by "web wallet". Keys belong to user and are never communicated or transmitted away from the client. Our server infrastructure, and by extension any wallet that relies on it, will not blindly follow a different chain. 
Hope this helps. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 19:06:09
Just to confirm. I am the owner of the  account. It is a normal 'user' account on github.

Hi there, I didn't see these questions. I will answer the most pertinent ones. Hope this helps. 


We welcome anyone to create issues, discussions, or PRs at anytime, we hope to receive more of them. Our wallet client is open source under the Unlicense and completely open to review. You can review the commit history here:  - I am not sure what you mean by code drops. 
 


First, I will disagree about anything being a farce. We have built a custom backend running on top of Bitcoin Core 0.15. This backend does manage balances and transaction history. The backend code will be made available to the community under an open source license before we release the 1.0 version of Samourai. Users will be able to bypass Samourai servers entirely by running Bitcoin Core 0.15 with our backend layer on top. 


I can only speak for Samourai and not any other of ‘these wallets’ but we are absolutely not selling information about users to any third party. There is no identifying information that is collected when creating a wallet, not even email address. Any sensitive information added to the app (like a trusted mobile number for remote commands) is stored on the client and never is communicated to any server (this can be verified in our source code). If users are worried about IP logging (we do not log IPs) they have the ability to use Tor or a VPN with the wallet. 


Wallet code is already released. Our back-end code will be released prior to our 1.0 release. We aren't logging any information about our users or selling any data to any third party.


Samourai wallet gives users the ability to create either standard transactions that look like any other, or transactions that dramatically increase the plausible deniability of linking with any certainty an input to an output. It's a chicken egg problem. If more wallets implemented BIP126 for example, these high entropy transactions would not stick out.

Hey there, 
It isn't that Ricochet is untraceable, it is that in order to trace it, the analysis firms must expend much higher resources to do so, and also increase their rate of false positives.
 Ricochet is designed primarily for sending to exchanges that will lock your coins and account if they see anything they disagree with between 1-4 hops backwards.  Searching farther back costs more for them, while it is very simple for us to add more hops. 
For breaking the trace, STONEWALL is far superior as it adds actual mathematically provable deniability between inputs and outputs of a transaction. Whirlpool -coming soon- based on ZeroLink breaks the trace fully.
So, it isn't about one tool to defeat the analysis firms, it is about a suite of tools for specific problems. 
Hope this helps.

Thanks for the mention
@_date: 2018-07-27 10:40:43
We fully support BIP 44, 49, and 84
You are asking for support for HD accounts other than account 0, which we are not ready to roll out support for. Samourai only works with account 0 on purpose: 44,49, and 84. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 16:27:43
Thanks for that it was very much appreciated. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:06:20
Not really yet, though it will help in the future. Honestly not much can be done other than experiencing the stress and fixing it (either through enhancing existing code, or throwing more hardware at it) as soon as possible. Sorry about the inconvenience. 
If you are experiencing persistant load issues please contact support with information as there might be something else going on and we'd love to help troubleshoot. 
@_date: 2015-09-22 16:25:42


@_date: 2018-07-27 10:48:01
Just FYI - As was pointed out, it should not be requesting permissions more than once, we cannot replicate that yet, but if that is occurring then it is a bug that we will fix. 
SMS is totally optional and not required for use. It is best that you keep the app updated as we try to fix bugs and increase stability with every release. 
@_date: 2018-07-27 10:41:43
Totally understandable. 
Please make sure to send a crash report when the app crashes if you are given the option to. It will help us squash those bugs going forward. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 12:24:45
Have you tried using our watch only app Sentinel? You will need to add both your BIP44 XPUB and your BIP49 XPUB to any watch only app. 
@_date: 2018-07-09 04:20:34
Prior to Ricochet 2.0 each hop would have 1 input and 1 output 
Ricochet 2.0 (triggers when you do a ricochet and have a PayNym connection with us) each hop has 1 input and 2 outputs (looks like a very standard tx) as you have it in this diagram. One output is for your own internal hop and one output pays part of the fee to Samourai across those hops.
@_date: 2015-09-22 18:56:17
haha. 3-4 months if all goes well. We're a small self funded team :)
@_date: 2018-07-08 03:14:48
Hi there, 
Your request is noted. Right now PIN is activated on timer instead of on screen close. However, if you fully exit the wallet by pressing the back key and then pressing ok - the PIN will be forced when you reopen the wallet, even immediately after. 
If you run into any issues or need further support feel free to reach out at support 
@_date: 2017-10-15 07:32:51
Hi there, this should help you.
@_date: 2018-04-26 17:18:28
@_date: 2015-11-08 02:03:27
Thanks for the shout out :)
I just accepted all pending Alpha requests. Enjoy!
If you used an APK from off the Play Store I recommend you re-install from the Play Store so you can receive auto updates (important especially while we are still Alpha). We are testing an awesome new stealth payments feature --implementation of BIP 47--  and want our testers to have access to that as soon as it is ready!
@_date: 2018-04-18 13:46:17
Then they should generate a BIP39 mnemonic externally without a passphrase and import it into Samourai. Certain functionality will be disabled however. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 19:36:09
We're hoping to have an iOS version of Sentinel relatively soon, hopefully you won't have to wait much longer. Glad to hear Sentinel on Android is working well for you :)
@_date: 2018-04-15 09:12:41
While we think it is a bit premature currently, we are excited about Lightning in the future. What we are keeping an eye out for is any potential privacy applications that can be created as a result of LN, that is where Samourai users are most likely to see rapid development as pertaining to LN. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 08:29:14
A passphrase is required to create a new wallet. You define the passphrase. This is within BIP39 Specification. 
@_date: 2015-11-08 02:27:28
Thanks for the awesome shout out. 
Just want to make sure everyone is clear:
Samourai Wallet is still in Alpha (although any tester will tell you how stable it is) and not currently open source. We of course intend to Open Source our entire code-base, but have made the business decision to retain our trade secrets during the course of development. We cannot compete with the funding that the major wallet providers can command, but we can compete with them in terms of building features that have never been seen before in a bitcoin wallet, but only if we don't give them the code before we launch. You can view our time line for development here 
Samourai will launch officially with built in Coin Mixing but that currently doesn't exist within the current Alpha build. We are currently working on our implementation of BIP 47 which is the newest and best standard for making and receiving stealth payments. 
What Samourai has today in terms of obfuscation is a mix of hard coded rules such as:
* [Deterministic sorting of inputs and outputs](
* [Merge Avoidance](
* Address Reuse Warning
and settings that the user can control per transaction such as:
* [Create a random amount of decoy change addresses](
* Create a transaction that *appears* to be a CoinJoin transaction on the block chain
Thanks for being a tester and telling people about our wallet, we rely on users like you!
@_date: 2018-04-15 08:28:08
TDevD and I started Samourai in Feb 2015 :)
@_date: 2015-10-24 21:04:56
Yes as of right now this timeline is still in effect. We are currently prioritising our manpower which is very limited into working with Justus and implementing BIP 47 Reusable Payment Codes as you mentioned. We are quite far along in this on the code side, and are just starting to get the UI in shape. We are very excited about this feature and its implications.
Mixing is very important to us, we are still in exploratory stages on how to mix effectively on mobile and are currently going back and forth on a few proposals, JoinMarket is one of those proposals. We will not begin work on the mixing aspect until we finish our implementation of BIP 47.
I'm glad you brought up logs. One of the most important features of Alpha 3 will be built in Tor integration (no setup, no external apps, it just works). This means that the user can use Shapeshift without revealing their IP address among other great privacy enhancements. But your concerns are certainly noted.
Thanks for the great feedback.
@_date: 2018-04-19 05:07:15
Without a BIP39 passphrase the wallet will not automatically save an encrypted backup of the wallet on your device (the backup is encrypted with the passphrase) nor will Remote SMS commands work.
Hope this helps. 
@_date: 2016-05-16 19:40:25
Sorry, must be a new policy of theirs. According to this PDF there still should be some unverified support.  
I suggest contacting their support before giving up entirely. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 08:26:35
Good show. Thanks for the shoutouts. But I think the co-host needs a shoulder to lean on.
@_date: 2015-10-28 03:19:09
Hi Marcus. We see the force close issue, very obscure bug that goes deep into BitcoinJ. Thanks very much for tripping it, we can now work on a fix. 
Balance and transaction issues should be resolved. 
@_date: 2015-10-24 21:25:24
iOS won't realistically happen until after Open Sourcing. We want to define the core privacy feature set on Android first and then bring over whatever we are allowed to on iOS. Unless something radically changes in our funding this is going to take a while because we are such a small team. 
@_date: 2015-10-22 15:59:07
And now you know which products and services to avoid. 
@_date: 2015-10-24 20:02:27
We did notice the Pin code issue and have already submitted a patch which should hit anytime now. Thank you for testing that though, and do update us when you get the latest update.
Also, were you just testing the Pin or do you plan on using it? We weren't sure if people would use the Pin entry screen on a watch only wallet or not. 
@_date: 2015-10-24 19:37:19
Hey, reposting from my other comment


We understand if you will not use the service while it remains closed source, but if you wouldn't mind at least testing out the product we are positive your feedback will make the world of difference.
Totally understand your feelings there, but we intend to open source completely in March. This is a strategic business decision as we are self funded and completely boot-strapped. Thanks!
@_date: 2015-10-25 06:12:28
Thanks for the feedback. Do you mean Fiat value plus BTC value in the Balance or on the actual transactions themselves?
@_date: 2017-05-22 16:04:07
I may have jumped the gun on wallet support. But it's a great start for BIP148 UASF support!
@_date: 2015-10-24 19:55:29
Hey there,
Thanks for the feedback, we will make sure to look into that issue asap. And thank you for the kind comments. 
@_date: 2015-10-25 07:50:01
Thank you very kindly for reaching out to us early on to give us the opportunity and platform to serve your users. 
To address your points:
a) private key sweep: This currently exists in Samourai and I imagine would be fairly trivial to implement into Sentinel and probably would be useful for people who want to sweep between paper wallets or sweep their paper wallets into their HD address space. 
b) showing fiat currency equivalent in the transaction log: This is planned, it didn't make it into this release but it is on our radar. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 01:39:22
Q3 2017. Thanks :)
@_date: 2015-10-30 06:19:59


We sure have. :)
Thanks for trying Sentinel out and keep the feedback and suggestions coming, that is the only we can develop into a rock solid product.
@_date: 2015-10-24 19:35:30
We are happy to answer any questions you may have about this product or release.
Sentinel is a great solution for anyone who wants the convenience and utility of a hot wallet for receiving payments directly into their cold storage or hardware wallets. Sentinel accepts XPUB's and individual bitcoin address. Once added you will be able to view balances, view transactions, and (in the case of XPUB's) deterministically generate addresses for that particular wallet. 
Sentinel is a fork of [Samourai Wallet]( with all spending and transaction building code removed. We plan on open sourcing Samourai and Sentinel at the same time for more details see the [Roadmap]( page
We understand if you will not use the service while it remains closed source, but if you wouldn't mind at least testing out the product we are positive your feedback will make the world of difference.
Thanks.

Trezor support is firmly on the roadmap. 
@_date: 2016-05-15 02:21:24
Unfortunately this is the correct answer. We have implemented payment codes that do solve for this use case quite well, but it isn't very useful until other wallets with much wider user bases also implement it as well. 
@_date: 2017-07-04 06:26:02
Yes I noticed that as well. We are pulling fee estimation from 21. They're being a little aggressive on the estimation. We will soon have our own fee estimation engine, but until then you can tap on the fee amount on the send screen to enter in your own custom fee in sat/b - I've been sending 15-20 sat/b fees the last few days with very good results :)
 
@_date: 2015-10-24 20:08:56
Yeah, that was our view as well. "It doesn't hurt to give people the option"
@_date: 2015-10-27 05:22:52
It should be fine now! Sorry about that. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 06:04:25
Hi there. Did you contact support? (support or live chat with us on support.samourai.io) 
The wallet cannot 'eat' anything. Since Samourai is a BIP39/44 wallet your funds are always associated with your 12 word mnemonic and passphrase. Provided you know both those things your $8 is quite safe. 
We're standing by to help if you need it
@_date: 2016-05-15 02:20:01
Our watch-only app 'Sentinel' allows you to add an xPub and retrieve the derived addresses for easy sending, but I agree with other posters that this is not the correct solution for the problem. 
@_date: 2017-07-04 06:26:15
Thanks very much.
@_date: 2016-05-15 03:08:28
You can get a virtual prepaid card denominated in USD, GBP, or EUR without AML requirements with a lifetime limit of $2,000 (I think). If you add your identity you can get the limit removed.

@_date: 2017-07-18 18:40:05
segwit.co is counting BIP9 activation of versionbit '1'  [BIP141]( Segwit
We **aren't** counting versionbit '4' which is [BIP91]( or what people are calling Segwit2x. 
You can use[ xbt.eu]( to track in more detail for multiple proposals. We're a bit to busy right now with the wallet to keep segwit.co updated with all the proposals out there. 
@_date: 2015-10-27 05:23:50
Force Closing after a deposit is not good. Next time can you click "Report" when it happens so we get the Stack Trace and can fix the bug. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-07-18 21:49:14
You can disable PIN Scramble in the Settings.
Just to confirm: You haven't lost any funds you are just concerned about it in the future because the recent PIN code issue? That is reasonable, and I hope you reconsider, but I just want to make sure you have access to your funds. 
Thanks 
@_date: 2017-07-18 20:54:26
Hi there,
First, please do contact support - we are really fast at responding and can usually help solve the issue. 
We've been seeing some PIN related bugs and we believe we have fixed them all now. It is impossible to 'lose coins' with Samourai. When you created the wallet you were presented with 12 words. Using those 12 words in conjunction with the passphrase you created will restore your coins in any Bitcoin wallet that supports BIP44/BIP39 standards (most of them). 
In addition to the 12 word restore option, Samourai also automatically backs up an encrypted copy of your wallet that you can use to very easily restore your wallet just by entering your passphrase. 
In fact, once you saw the Toast notification reminding you of your 6 digit code, you had already restored your wallet from the backup and the PIN code that was shown to you should have worked just fine. Let us know if it didn't.
We're sorry to have lost you as a user, but do keep in mind we are still in Alpha and receiving reports on any bugs or issues you find would not only help us tremendously but also all the other users who are helping to test. 
Thanks 
**Edit: It is essential you contact us at our support email address so that we may guide you in restoring access to your funds. We're standing by waiting.**
@_date: 2017-07-04 14:02:35
We are in the final stages of internal testing of our own brand new back-end. In addition many privacy enhancements and reliability improvements, speed of loading wallet balance and transactions should be much faster.

Use Ricochet Send when sending to Coinbase. It should help with situations like this.  
Totally messed up. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:12:08
Thanks for the support. 
If you are a Samourai Wallet user you can add the public Samourai Wallet payment code  and then send donations to that way which is more privacy preserving for both of us. 
Otherwise feel free to send a donation to a static bitcoin address here: 39gg5ZaJmbBm1ky8YE5VW6chr2ijLukFkm

A 3rd party never controls the wallet. The wallet is recreated on the device client side. The user should wipe the wallet once they finish boosting the stuck transaction.
Source is available here: 
However, you are correct, one shouldn't go around entering their recovery words in any app. They must do their own research. We stand by our products and our reputation. There are many people who desperately need a transaction to confirm quickly when it is stuck with a low fee, we hope this app is useful for them.
@_date: 2019-05-02 17:33:16

No problem. You should try to restore from the auto backup first ( - you'll only need your passphrase for this. 
Otherwise you can restore from your mnemonic and passphrase ( This method of course works with Samourai or any compatible (BIP39/44) wallet.
