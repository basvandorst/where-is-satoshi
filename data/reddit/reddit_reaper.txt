@_date: 2017-12-22 17:51:26
Bch at 0.00 lmfao most likely broken but hilarious none the less
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:46:00
Use coinbases gdax site to said fees. Be sure to learn how to use it first though

There's no possible way they can shut it down. They can make it illegal to convert it to usd but then they're basically saying we can't sell anything we consider that has value like gold etc.

$35k pfft. 100k!!!!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:42:14
Ty! I wish i had known that lol
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:27:01
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:24:59
Yup but the guy is still an idiot
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:00:57
Don't invest more than you're willing to lose. You made a very irresponsible decision. This is long term
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:01:11
Send that to op lol
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:29:36
If they're able to process way more transactions per second regardless of it being cheaper shouldn't they actually make more money?
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:38:11
I can't wait for lightning
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:05:14
Yeah but they keep defunding them for no reason and their resources are already shit and they haven't been able to update their IT infrastructure in years. The only reason the US doesn't have automatic taxes done like other countries is because intuit and hr block lobby like hell to never let that happen. This country really needs to make "campaign contributions" illegal but that will never happen with those greedy bastards in power
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:38:16
They already are lol
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:20:13
Ok but was this included in the tax reform bill or is it it's own separate bill
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:45:14
Ach transfer's are taking a bit on cb currently. My friend's took 1.5 weeks and remember it's only business days. Just gotta wait.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:36:25
And they did lol hit 19.3k and dropped back to 16 where it started this morning lol
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:33:39
Never invest more than you're willing to lose
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:25:09
Really now? So if i use my cb account in gdax when i decide to buy or sell id pay lower fees?
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:29:26
I'll gladly HODL on to that for you. I don't want you to be burdened by the guilt
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:21:08
You'd probably need to install an old version of the app for it to work
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:05:48
Sorry fixed now lol
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:59:16
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:08:17
Then you're good. Invest only what you're willing to lose and let it ride and enjoy the earnings or losses. As it goes with investments. There's always a risk, question is if you're willing and able to take it
@_date: 2017-12-26 09:22:28
Hold up is this shit for real? Did this get put into that tax bill? If so we're going to have to start hiding our trades
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:29:51
Probably because he didn't buy early lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:54:19
Especially because of lower fees
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:00:14
Transfer to coinbase exchange wallet and sell and then transfer to your bank account. There's other ways and well but I'm new so I'm sure others will tell you
@_date: 2018-05-02 21:34:42
Hopefully it gives you the private key so you can sweep the wallets
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:20:49
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:07:07
No one knows. It's an investment and a risk. You never bet more than you're willing to lose. If you lost it all tomorrow will you still be okay? You need to ask yourself that question. It can go to the Moon and make you some profit or you can lose it all if BTC crashes. You take the risk
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:32:20
Because of a court case they lost because a bunch of people weren't reporting their capital gains in taxes
@_date: 2018-04-04 18:49:44
Where's my money
