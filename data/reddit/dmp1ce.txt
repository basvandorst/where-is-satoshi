Common law means to me.

I think that is pretty simple to follow and could be consistently enforced without favoring any particular group.

You and I favor these ideals of peace, so I wouldn't say it is intrinsic in the human species.  Are we anomalies or are you saying even a community of people with these ideals would resort to force?
I believe it has a lot to do with how we are raised but also how we communicate.  I think the human condition is to adapt.  If the environment is of violence then we be more prone to violence.  If we are raised with peace then we will be more prone to peace.

You bring up great point about what is "harm".  It is a difficult question to answer. I would prefer a system where people communicate emotions and needs with each other so that they can best get their needs met or harms addressed.  Harm isn't black and white in all cases but that doesn't mean we need a special class of people.  I think it means we need to communicate with each other more productively or seek help in communicating.
I am not in favor of punishment but instead restorative justice.  Meaning we strive to make the harmed whole again instead of punishing the party who was in the wrong.
One name for what I'm talking about is Nonviolent Communication.  On a society level what I'm talking about is anarchy or voluntarism.

The law is arbitrarily enforced.  There is nothing consistent about it.  If police were consistent about enforcing the law most of us would be in jail for victimless crimes and that is ridiculous.
This is me trying to convince you that the current system is broken, which is *something* as well.  The current state only exists because enough of us allow it to exist.  When your buddy or uncle support people being put in jail for the victimless crimes and you do not challenge them then you are complicite in unjust state law.  I'm not saying you do that per se but in general many people just go along to get along.
My point is that the law was not created to be useful for the common man but instead to serve few politically connected.  We have been raised to view crime is bad and that is fine if the law is just and sane, but that is not the case in the US.  To for me the word "crime" seems mostly used to promote guilt and surrender to the state.  I suggest that we take back our language and think of a sane law such as common law or nature law and not statutory law designed by politicians.  Then we won't have these ridiculous victimless crimes society uses to attack peaceful people.

@_date: 2018-06-24 13:55:50
I agree paper wallets have a lot of problems. I find the printer issues troubling. However, bitaddress makes it very easy to store bitcoins offline, which I think is a boon for many who are not good at storing things digitally.
I actually like the mnemonic idea better but which tools do this? Could I generate a one time mnemonic with Electrum?
With Electrum you can go through the process of creating a standard wallet. Copy the seed. Get a public key for sending to. Then delete the wallet file. Electrum now has a "Delete" option. There are more manual steps than with bitaddress but at least you don't need to use a printer if you hand write the seed.

I think it makes sense to broadcast transactions through the Tor network. That way, it is much more difficult for someone to determine that your IP address is associated with an address in the broadcast transaction.
This is easy to do with Electrum and Mycelium. For Electrum, run the Tor browser and use the proxy port 9150. For Mycelium, download Orbot and turn on Tor in the settings.
Simply receiving money is pretty private by default, but you will get better privacy with Tor also, because Electrum, Mycelium and other Bitcoin clients ask a server for address information, which can give away which addresses you own.

I have never heard that definition for racist before. Usually people use racist when referring to someone who thinks a race is superior to another race, which I do not.
However, I do believe their is difference between people which can be seen in personality. Are you aware that IQ has been measured for over a century and regions that have IQ on average less than 85 often have difficultly maintaining democracy? Are you aware that there is a "warrior gene" which is more prevalent in the African people, less so in Europeans and even less so in East Asians?


"Monstrous", "appalling" and "racist" are not arguments. I can see you are angered by the ideas I have put forth but that doesn't make them invalid.


Thank you for the suggestion. Because the Somalian IQ on average is 68, the ideas I am presenting would make no sense to most in Somalia. In the US, 70 IQ is mentally disabled!

Most people would not pay taxes given the choice.


I don't want to move from my friends and family. I want to make my home region better. I want our society to be more peaceful and entrepreneural.
Anyway, Somalia taxes up to 35%. 
Rwanda has the same or higher taxation. 
Both governments have much higher corruption than the US so likely tax rates and other laws will change to benefit the politicians. I already said that I think westerners are a better fit for a more peaceful society, not Africians. But I'd like to be proven wrong.


Which 'no tax' country are you talking about? Because I wouldn't last in another country is not an argument relevant to the discussion.


My parents bought their own insurance. My parents bought life insurance. My parents had family and friends to help their kids.
How do you know you are paying in full for the government services? It isn't like they itemize the services you have used. Some people use more, some use less. I'm pretty sure I use less, but I don't know for sure. I pay all my taxes, so there is no reason to think otherwise.
Everyone is forced to pay their taxes as I already said earlier.


That is certainly what their job is, to FORCE people to pay taxes.

@_date: 2018-07-03 17:27:57
Because you are not creative enough to imagine how services could be provided voluntarily, does not make taxation moral. I am opposed to taxation because it is immoral. 


Many private roads exist. Building and maintain roads is not a difficult problem.


Any community or private person is free to hire protection as they see fit. Military to protect a city or region can be provided by militia.


House and car alarms and locks work well. Tracking devices on cars are an additional deterrent.


I would hope you don't live in neighborhood where people you walk by want to murder you! Anyone could prepare themselves by being trained to carry a deterrent such as a gun or they could hire a bodyguard if they are really fearful.


Fire protection could be provided by insurance companies. Some fire departments are already voluntary departments.


Charity has existed for these situations for centuries. Family, friends and church also have helped with these events in the past.


Reputation for the company putting out poisonous foods would be very bad. Killing customers is not really a winning business model.


Much like roads, this is not a difficult problem. It only requires a demand for clean water and waste disposal. If communities want to attract new people then they will need to plan for sewage systems.


I did and it was pretty awful. I didn't have any real skills until starting to actually work and provide value.


Many parents abuse there kids now. The state isn't stopping them.


I'm not aware of the state doing much disease monitoring now. It is up to each individual to take care of their own health from what I can tell. There is horrible health in the US currently with many people overweight.


Standards can exist without a state. At least consumers would be able to decide which standards they wanted their home to adhere to, if the community or home owners association didn't require one.


Name calling is not an argument. The state is stealing from you. I am not stealing from you. You have little control what the state does with the stolen funds. I'm on your side. I don't want anyone, you included, to be stolen from. It is immoral.

I also pointed out some situations where the state isn't doing anything or doing a poor job. In the absence of coercion the market would provide services for anything that is in demand. This is what currently happens throughout all the economy except for when the state stops peaceful interaction.


It is noble to help people from getting robbed. I pay for every service I use. No one can avoid sales tax or property tax, although I hope someday people will accept that taxation is theft and stop. What pays for much of the services you are fond of is debt created through monetary policy; enslaving the future generations to debt they can never repay.


People couldn't comprehend a world without slavery at one time either. You don't steal because it is immoral.


Taxation is not voluntary, which makes it functionally equivalent to theft. The only difference is taxation is institutionalized and backed up by overwhelming force. It is the difference between love making (charity) and rape (taxation).


The black market is enormous. If you ever left a cash tip for a waitress it was probably a black market transaction because many won't report that.


I agree. Some people and regions are not likely to adopt a laissez faire economy for many reasons. That doesn't mean taxation, slavery other types of brutality are suddenly moral. The west is in a unique opportunity to adopt a more moral society and it doesn't involve much of a change. We only need to accept that taxation is immoral and voluntarily trade with each other more often.

Still not an argument. Labels are not an argument.


Africians are more suited for a sunny climate. Why doesn't that make Africans superior? You are making a value judgement about who is 'superior'. Not me. I don't even know what it means to be 'superior'.


I think murder is immoral. I think planning to murder someone is planning to do something immoral. I would personally be disgusted by someone planning murder, but I would also be disgusted by a eating contest. Disgust doesn't determine morality, it is just a feeling which might hint at morality.


Sorry, feeling is not an argument. Experience is not an argument.


Because it is probably easier to find people who can understand and help with a more peaceful society here in the US.


I'm scared to move to a region with a completely different culture and language which has historically been more tribal. I would also probably be singled out for being white. IQ is a good basis to work from when trying to change a group of peoples behaviour. I already know individuals who agree with me, so if I was just looking for that I wouldn't go anywhere.


I think that is a good idea, but time is limited and I need to make decisions about where my time is best used. I feel I will have more effect here in the US for the reasons I have already laid out. But you are right. I could be wrong because I don't know many Somalians. Or the IQ results could be incorrect.

The basic idea is you, as the owner would run a node which you would have to check into on regular intervals.

I did over simplify the statement. Let me clarify. Taxation is against the will of the person being taxed in the same way theft is against the will of the victim. A voluntary exchange of money would be called charity or a donation.


Insults are not an argument.


I love where I live and I want to make it even better. I have no desire to live somewhere else.


You have no idea how old I am. Insults are not an argument. If you have better use of your time then by all means. Your actions say otherwise.


Rape is akin to taxation and many other immoral actions in that one of the parties doesn't want it to happen. I don't want to be taxed. I would rather pay for the services I use directly. Many so called "services" I don't want to pay for at all, but am forced.

In what way is that story coercive?  Isn't that story completely anarchistic?  There was no boss or central authority telling anyone to build the chair.  Everyone did their part because it benefited them.

If people are free to produce their own food they will keep some for themselves, because it is required for them to survive.
What I'm thinking is community gardens or farms.  Sure, they might send some of their food away to make a profit, but they are going to feed themselves first.  If I owned my own garden I wouldn't let myself or my neighbors starve.  It makes no sense.
Now, if you have government regulation on food production or taxes then it is going to be difficult to grow your own food.  States also tend to make the population much poorer making it difficult to own land and produce your own food.

I don't envision a central organization that resolves all disputes.  The parties involved need to work it out or find someone to help them work it out.  That is the nature of anarchism.  If I, or anyone, could answer these questions and solve all the potential social problem, then that would be a strong case for statism.


I say this just as an opinion and observation.  If parents do not raise their kids and the kids are left alone, the child will certainly die.  If parents are going to abandon their kids, why have them at all?  It doesn't make sense to me.  I'm sure there will be vigilante groups that seek to find and bring justice to child abuse victims, which I support, but I don't think I would personally get involved unless I saw physical and blatant child abuse.  I may take a child in if he/she was abandoned too.


Often the majority make decisions which hurt certain minorities.  An example is slavery in the US.  Slavery is much more difficult to enforce when it isn't enforced by the state.  It is debatable whether or not the US is a democracy or not though.  But no, I wouldn't say that the majority of people are bad.  However, when you can throw your opinions and desires to the state to do the dirty work for you, bad things tend to happen.  No one is held accountable for what the state does if it hurts people.  Being a monopoly on violence, how could anyone hold them accountable?
In an anarchist society, the individual has just as much rights as the majority.  There are no written laws that can benefit one group and hurt another.  The only law is common law or the basic law that all peaceful humans would follow.  Do not harm each other and keep your word.  Keeping your word is the foundation of all contract law, which allows you to build voluntary laws as you see fit between people you deal with.


People would have to take them in or they would die.  There is of course family and friends.  I'm sure there would be orphanages too like you *alluded* to.


I cannot find it.  Perhaps it is a myth.  Maybe not a very good point either, on my part.  I still stand by the majority though.  After all the smallest minority is the individual.  Bitcoin was created by an individual, supposedly.

@_date: 2013-05-11 04:12:31
Anarcho-capitalism doesn't preclude the possibility that capital could be owned among all of the workers.  Everything in a business could be owned communally and decisions made collectively.  As long as people are not coercing each other in the relationship, this would still compatible with anarcho-capitalism as I understand it.
If you are saying that anarchy can only exist if know one owns property, then I do not see how anarchy can exist.

I think that is a great question.  I think it should depend on the circumstances.  If they really have no connection, but the workers on the farm have a close connection, then perhaps the land should go to the workers.  Or if a will was left that the child should get the land, then perhaps it should be passed on to the children, even though they do not have a close connection.
The question you ask doesn't address the "social contract" which you are eluding to though.  I think that unborn children cannot agree to a contract, which makes the "social contract" a fantasy for the people who want to believe their allegiance to the state has a reason and purpose.




You said to stop using the system, so I wouldn't have to pay taxes.  Then I said, if I didn't buy food, then I would die, because there are food taxes.  Then you said I should just go on welfare.  But then I would be using the system even more.  My point is, the government has it's fingers in everything, making it nearly impossible to escape.  Even if I went to another country I would still find myself in another state.  For now, I am choosing to make my stand here, where my friends and family live and support me.


The US is just the gang that was most successful.  Fundamentally, the US government is no different than the mafia.  They take your money for your "protection".  Who knows, maybe the warlords in Somalia are more understanding and nicer than the people in the US government.  If they didn't demand 30% of my income, that would be very nice!


Thanks.  I will definitely give it my best shot.  I'm not looking to change the entire government necessarily.  I just want a pocket of friends and family who respect me enough not to have me put in prison if I don't pay strangers in Washington.  I live in North Carolina, so this applies to that government too.  Fortunately, there are many supportive friends and family that I have already and I am quite happy.  I sincerely hope that others can find the happiness that I have found.  In fact I wouldn't mind the socialist or mutalist society if it meant that everyone could have a happy life.  My belief is that, when coercion is institutionalized, and people have to constantly live under the threat of the state, that happiness is harder than it should be and could be if we only treated each other with respect.
BTW, in the US, the majority do not vote.  So maybe there are more people who don't want a government than you think.  Also, recent polls point to popularity in state succession.  State succession is a trend toward more localized sovereignty, individual sovereignty being the goal.

The parties which have a stake the the property would decide.  If they have a disagreement, but can agree on a third party arbitrator, then the arbitrator can decide.  This presupposes that the anarchist society came about because the majority agree that peaceful interaction are favored over violent conflicts.  If this is not the case, then it is unlikely the society would be anarchistic.


Thanks again. lol


Yes, but with caveats.  I am in favor of unschooling, which means that the child should direct their own learning.  Part of that learning includes learning how to make decisions for themselves.  Of course, it is the job of the parents to protect the child until they are capable of making decisions for themselves.  When they are capable and how to determine that is a subjective problem.  I tend to think that children can start making decisions for themselves at an early age.  It is probably different for each child.


Democracy is simply the tyranny of the majority.  Also, as I mentioned before, most people do NOT vote.  Shouldn't that mean that no one should be in power?  I'm sure the members of the mafia would vote for themselves to be head gang of the city.


Perhaps.  I have empathy for anyone who has went through something like that.  It sounds awful.


You're right.  I didn't read the article very well.  If that is correct though, that is roughly 1/5 of the pollers.  The Revolutionary War only had 1/3 support.  I think dismissing the minority is not a very wise thing to do given that many major societal changes where first supported by a minority before they became popular.

AnCap here.  I like the political links because austrian economics tries to explain why competiion in ALL industries works for the benifiet of society.  As far as I know libertarianism and anarcho-capitalism are the only political ideologies that are based in austrian economics.
So, when someone who knows little about the motivation behind bitcoin asks themselves "why would I want to use bitcoins?  I already have USD and credit card."  Libertarians and ancaps have been there to answer that question.
While not all ancaps agree that bitcoin will work or is a good idea, I think they all will welcome the extra competition and can descibe the problem with the current fiat system very well.

In the worst case a corporation would turn into the same thing we have now.  Of course it is possible.
Factually, corporations are a spawn of the state.  States recognize corporations as legal entities and give them legal protection in exchange for taxes that they pay.  Corporations also lobby like crazy to get the laws and regulation that benefit them most.  Without the government, companies will need to compete head to head instead of getting the government to do their dirty work.  Without violence (government) being the "standard" way of dealing with problems, perhaps people would try to peacefully dispute problems.  I'd make the claim that peace is more profitable than violence, and businesses men like profit.

I would say that anarcho-capitalism and anarcho-communism are effectively the same thing, although supposedly being opposite sides of the spectrum.

I disagree anyone needs to have a boss if they don't want to.  It is not a life or death decision.  Many people do fine with or without a boss.  For that reason, bosses are not a coercive relationship.  Everyone could choose to not have a boss, if they wanted to.
Many people choose bosses because they provide a service.  And those people can quit anytime that they want to.
The state is different in that people can not choose to not participate, because they will be put in jail or killed for not complying.

I can only explain how taxation is theft by defining the terms.
From wikipedia,
theft: In common usage, theft is the taking of another person's property without that person's permission or consent with the intent to deprive the rightful owner of it.
Robbery is the crime of taking or attempting to take something of value by force or threat of force or by putting the victim in fear.
tax: A tax (from the Latin taxo; "rate") is a financial charge or other levy imposed upon a taxpayer (an individual or legal entity) by a state or the functional equivalent of a state such that failure to pay is punishable by law.
More accurately, I should have said that a tax is the same a robbery.  The state will intimidate their subjects by threatening jail, if they do not pay taxes.  If they refuse jail, they will be disabled or killed.  A robber will rob someone of their money by threatening violence.  If the person does not pay, then they will be disabled or killed.
You made the argument that the state pays for things on my behalf such as roads, courts, police, schools, etc..  Suppose the robber were to send me groceries for the week after robbing me.  Would that make it NOT robbery.  Would we say that the person who took my money at the threat of violence was simply doing me a service?  Or lets put it another way.  Suppose it only costs 1 million dollars to build a highway.  If the state taxes 10 million dollars to build the highway, does that make it theft?  What if they tax 100 million or 1 billion dollars?  Or suppose that the state taxes you and gives you something that you don't want at all?
I am very opposed to the state taxing me and paying for schools and wars in particular.  I view the school system as mostly forced indoctrination and wars as state funded murder around the world.  I would never pay for those thing if I was given the choice.  That is why it is theft, because I am not given the choice.  Just like I am not given the choice if I am taken at gun point by a robber.  It doesn't matter if the robber sends me flowers after they have robbed me, it is still robbery.


I can understand your need for a safety net in case people fall on bad times.  I am happy that the state was able to help you.  But again, your gain was at the suffering of people like me who did not want to pay taxes.  There are voluntary ways of getting help if it is needed.  These programs do not need to be coerced, and in the past they have not been coercively funded.  See friendly societies for one such example of what I'm talking about. 


For examples of "more free" markets performing better than "less free", check out the Index of Economic Freedom and notice how the freer the state the more prospity in general.  
I agree, efficiency isn't the most important thing though.  I believe that when people get their personal needs meet in terms of financial security, that they will be much more charitable, and we won't have a need for coercively funded welfare.  Again, friendly societies are some evidence for this.  With such a large welfare state, that we have now, many people feel they don't need to do anything.  They feel like people who are in need are being taken care of already. Unfortunately, the state often does a poor job of actually doing what it claims it is going to do.


Hatred of the Market - 


I mostly agree with you here.  The state reflects the state of human evolution, in my opinion.  When we figure out how to be more peaceful towards one another, then the state will be seen for what it is.  The state will be seen as a relic of our violent past, much like we view the Incan pyramids or ancient Roman colosseums.  We clearly not there yet.  Hopefully we are close though.

The prisons mostly exist because of the state.  In the absence of a state the prison industry wouldn't be so profitable or might not exist at all.
But yes, if there is a need for prisons, competition will tend to make things better.  Competition will lower profits for the prison owners and save money for the customers of the prisons.  As far as I know, the only customers of prisons are state governments.

Welfare is also part of the govenment system.

You say these ideas need to be discussed in other areas and then proceed to all me specific questions here. I think this demonstrates that the bitcoin and anarchy do have crossover at the very least. 
5 years ago (before bitcoin) you might have said, "I don't like central banks controlling money, but I like having a monitary system to buy things. Without government, who would print the money? " The point being, the market (peaceful, voluntary interaction) can provide goods and services which are in demand. You only have to allow it to do so. 
Edit: Sorry,  I thought you were saying you DIDN'T want to discuss anarchism here.

Really, why?  Am I expected to be an expert in every possible problem that could occur.


If kids are being abused, and the vigilante group is actually preventing abuse, then it is questionable whether I'm supporting violence or preventing it.  It is a tough question though.  I understand you desire to nitpick every possible issue to make these ideas look bad, but these tough questions should be individual choices, and the decision isn't clear all of the time.


Of course you have the freedom to live how you want as long as you are not impeding on others freedom to live how they want.  Abuse is clearing a violation of another persons freedom.  To force your will on another person would make sort of a mini-state over the other person.  In that case, those people are really not living "without rulers".  "Without rulers" is the literal meaning of anarchy.  It is NOT "without rules" it is "without rulers".  That is a subtle but important difference.  We all have to abide by many natural laws.  But there doesn't have to be any rulers.


As long as your partner agrees with you not wearing a condom, then I don't see the problem.


I don't think that's right.  Skin color doesn't hurt anyone.  Although I think indoctrinating kids with a religious belief is harmful, I wouldn't support a vigilante group in that case.  I don't think it warrants a reaction like that.


I apologize for the incorrect statement about the revolutionary war, if it was incorrect.  I don't see how having incorrect facts means that I haven't thought critically about a subject.
When you say you changed your mind when you grew up, I get quite frustrated.  I have a need to be taken seriously, no mater what my age or maturity level.  Could you perhaps stick to the arguments?  I would rather not get into a psychoanalyzes of each other.  But maybe that is where this conversation is inevitably leading. *sigh*
I became an anarchist because I observed that the state hurts individuals I know in my personal life.  Then I logically concluded that an organization which is based on taxation and claims to protect is a contradiction.  It is not possible for the organization to steal my money and also protect me.  If they wanted to protect me, then they wouldn't steal from me in the first place.  This means, that in order to have a society which is truly peaceful, a state which taxes the entire population, cannot exist.  What is left is the market, individuals peacefully contracting with each other in order to best get their needs met.
I also believe that anarchism is the most efficient society as far as production goes, but fundamentally I am an anarchist because I deeply believe that we should be stealing from each other to try and solve our problems.


It is easier if I just link to the "evidence".  It is debatable and quite in depth.
Silk Road could be considered anarchistic ?
If I can think of more then I'll let you know.


I don't think that anarchy would exist without most people having good intentions.  But I think anarchy would deal with the minority that had bad intentions (thieves, murders, etc) just fine.  This is why I spend a lot of my personal time trying to get those in my life to communicate feelings and needs to each other effectively.  This is the foundation of understanding and peace in our society.  With the majority of peaceful people, I feel like a stateless society is inevitable.  If we cannot learn to be peaceful, then we can look forward to more of the same.  Look into non-violent communication and unschooling if you are interested in these types of ideas.
The fact that is very visible to me is that the state steals from all of us on a regular basis.  We give this theft the euphemism of taxes, but that doesn't change the fact that states are taking individuals money by threatening violence.  If a society can be conceived of that just doesn't institutionalize theft, it would be worth looking into, in my opinion.  I think it is worth the risk.

Aren't the people working in factories providing goods that are needed by humanity as well?  Both the owners and the workers are working to create goods such as the computer you are using.  Do you view this as beneficial?  Do you think goods such as computers should be produced a different way?
Do you think that people view you, with your computer, as a capitalist who is not sharing your "means of production"?  You could run a website off of your computer and provide jobs for people to work on it.  How would you be different than other business owners who offer jobs?


Many people have come out of poverty due to business giving jobs to people too.  I don't understand how you can conclude that capitalists are responsible for all poor people without mentioning the people who have been brought out of poverty.


Yes, I feel grateful that I have the job I do.  But I'm very confused by this statement.  Factories made the computer you are using.  In a sense, your lifestyle depends on the people in those factories.  Isn't it an insult to tell them that they are being taken advantage of when they might not feel that way?  They might feel as grateful I do to have my job.


I have worked for software companies before where I got an hourly wage and the owners reaped the rewards or paid the costs.  The reason I stopped working for them is because I wanted to take the risk myself, as an owner.  It was nice to be able to depend on a regular hourly wage however.  That is what the business owner was offering me, by shielding me from all the overhead that a business needs to keep up with.  And now, from time to time, I will hire contractors to help me out with my projects.  They get an hourly wage and I make all the profit, if there is any.


I agree.  But I'm confused how you envision anarchy working.  Is there no one who can get an hourly wage in anarchy?  Do factories not exist?  Are all means of production divided between all the workers?
