I am not ashamed :)

There is a huge difference between curing age-related diseases like Alzheimers and curing "aging".
The former is generally improving the quality of our lifetimes on earth. The latter improves quantity at the expense of quality and diversity. A society with these multi-centenary people who refuse to let go and leave room for the younger generations looks *incredibly* depressing to me.

Wanting to cure aging is *incredibly* pointless and selfish.
It takes humility to realize that you are not indispensable and that your dying is a good thing. It makes room for younger generations. This is how life works and what makes it so interesting.

I am not sure if you are implying that I am not real or that I have an agenda, but it is not the case. I registered because it is the first time I have something which I think is worth saying here : "Thank you Core".

If it's confirmed, it's confirmed.

I did not say you should forget about Segwit.

Without 15% hashpower, the difficulty will be too great and transactions on the new chain will not be confirmed after hours, days or weeks. The BIP148 chain will instantly be worthless. So please tell me... how are you going to get to 15%?

Bitcoin could do both.

It does not really fix it, it only makes it less lucrative.
My point is that it will be a lot harder to get Segwit if we don't fix AsicBoost first...

I want Segwit too. Please read my post. Fixing AsicBoost first greatly increases the likelihood we get Segwit in the end.
