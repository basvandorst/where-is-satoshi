This "victim bashing" seems to be very popular on Reddit.
Just as manhunt was after Boston bombings.

I lost many BTC with Gox, but still have many BTC outside Gox. So in my case it would be better to make a deal with Gox, e.g. renouncing a share of my BTC in Gox in order to get the rest back ASAP.
But thanks for being productive and for not trolling others.

Bitcoin cafe will make up all losses of Mt. Gox. :-)

I am open to that! Lost much BTC @ Gox but also still have much BTC in paper wallets. If someone knows a crowdfunded assassination service WITH SERIOUS ESCROW I am interested.
Of course this is just trolling. Really. Reeeally. :D

Your money isn't gone. It just belongs to someone else now.
That's digital robbery. Bitcoin is flawed by design.

Stop that nasty victim bashing.

Ich have ~30 BTC (1/3 of the assets I made with early adopting) in Gox. If Gox comes up with a serious business plan, I could imagine depositing a few new coins.
However, Gox has to be 100% transparent and customer-focused with daily, straight-talking updates and fast replies to inquiries. They should also have a publically known physical headquater you can write, call and visit. Also they have to continually prove they still own newly deposited BTC.

744,408 BTC

This makes me think about a crowdfunded assassination against a fat frappuccino addict.

And as I said before: stop trolling/bashing the victims! :-)

Get the firefox addon "Update Scanner" point it to e.g. " set check interval to 5 minutes and use the Star Trek TNG red alert sound as alarm tune (needs to be a wave file). So red alert will kick in when the cube-shaped frappuccino freighter publishes bad news again.

Ah, fuck it!
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:43:54
You should type more !!!!!! LOL

Clever fake! URL seems to prove the claim in the headline.
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:18:12
When using your link, it works. Thank you very much! :-)
Update: The old link is now working again, too.

All German IP addresses in this tree belong to Hetzner AG.
Important or irrelevant?
@_date: 2014-03-04 15:43:30
Sorry, but I don't think it went that way. Gox most likely had massive BTC inflow due to arbitrage trading.
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:53:05
I just found out Morn is in fact a HOLOGRAM set up in order to lull customers into false confidence!
The real Morn escaped with all the BTC a long time ago!
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:14:47
Perhaps Morn has some BTC left in his second stomach.
@_date: 2014-02-24 13:07:32
Would be interested in buying Gox coins, too. ^^
I'll send 1 BTC to any wallet for 4 Gox BTC. Escrow is OK.

This account is new!
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:56:37
~30 BTC, but a 10,000.00 SEPA withdrawal came through fine a few days ago.
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:22:43
There are some SR people very pissed by Gox for years now.
