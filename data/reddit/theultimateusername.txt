Fog them. Or depending on the amount send them to me and i'll get them cleared and sent to you in cash for a fee. PM.

Dubai; this is a mobile wallet if that helps
@_date: 2014-09-24 13:12:33
Sweet, how is the signup process, how long does it take to get verified?
@_date: 2014-10-03 22:04:38
I swear man.... 
@_date: 2014-10-03 22:05:31
Yeah, basterds....
@_date: 2014-10-07 16:44:41
Seems from OPs post that the items have actually been paid and sent. If so, there's no reason for purse to be holding onto his bitcoin. If they haven't actually been sent, that's a different case. 
@_date: 2014-09-23 19:12:07
Where are you based?
@_date: 2014-09-18 18:22:50
Gold dropped because of market announcements, unrelated to btc.
BTC at 420's now, me buying! Should be a relapse soon, not sure if it'll drop a bunch more but still a good time to buy methinks
@_date: 2014-09-19 17:37:40
Depends how risk averse you are. I like my risk. More risk but more opportunity for profit.
@_date: 2014-09-24 13:47:04
Sweet :'( 
Still waiting for that invite, sigh
@_date: 2014-01-09 04:28:46
I looked for bitcoin on amazon, couldn't find any
@_date: 2014-09-21 17:01:50
@_date: 2014-10-03 22:13:55
That's it? Figured it would be a lot higher. Pretty sure a ton of cash has been stolen too. Haven't you seen Ocean's 11?
@_date: 2014-09-21 12:15:57
Actually, bitcoin is money, it is a currency. No, not a stock or contract or network, or a software. Or any of the other crap. It is money though.
@_date: 2014-10-03 22:09:08
No, pretty correct. They only accept US credit cards. 
@_date: 2014-10-03 22:10:13
Smart guy eh
@_date: 2014-09-21 12:26:18
They're not the same.
Bitcoin is more like cash. 
Paypal is more like a bank account that you put cash into.
@_date: 2014-09-23 13:28:04
@_date: 2014-09-22 20:55:17
Fuck those guys.
@_date: 2014-09-23 19:10:03
About to? You're soooo 2 hours ago
@_date: 2014-09-18 18:13:57
It's not that difficult, but it does need a little bit of effort. You can use the bitcoin ATM in Dubai, buy localbitcoins to meet someone and pay cash, use virwox (if you want credit card payments etc), or use one of the hundreds of services out there by transferring cash to them one way or another. Bitcoin isn't as straightforward as setting up an account and getting cash right there and then, but with a little bit of effort you can pretty much get whatever you want. I'm between Dubai and Bahrain and i've bought well over 10btc over the past 2 months.

Anyone else worried when it dipped below 5k? I was excited buying in the 6-8k range but when it dipped below even I started getting skeptical lol. Fomo 1000 now but I have a nice stash so I'm pretty happy
@_date: 2019-06-23 08:15:03
I know I am, welcome to the club
@_date: 2019-06-23 06:46:26
Says me. It's an opinion. As valid as your opinion.
@_date: 2019-06-22 19:52:09
But at whatever price point you want. Just consider whatever money you put in as gone. In general mybstrategy is buying in downturns, not when it's going up. That's when u sell
@_date: 2019-06-22 07:19:28
That was pretty short actually the other cycles were longer. I remember the wait from when it settled at 400-600 to the last rally point took a good 2.5 years or so
@_date: 2019-06-23 02:35:52
I don't think 100k is realistic although that would be nice. I'm thinking if it rallies this time, it tops out around 40/50k max or even 60 if it's an extreme case. As much as I would love it to do it, it can't do 2000% increases anymore, not at this level
@_date: 2019-06-23 02:30:18
Yes of course. I think everyone needs to get into the process no matter what price point. Just put 10 dollars. Understand how it works now.
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:43:11
This post is like, sooooo 12 hours ago
@_date: 2019-06-22 04:23:45
Happy bitday
@_date: 2019-06-22 19:48:28
Well to them it was 20k and it crashed. They'll take note when it goes over 15/16k
@_date: 2019-06-22 19:50:54
Really hope it does. Still have some cash that came in recently  which I didn't in Jan Feb
@_date: 2019-06-23 02:37:27
Yeah let's believe that guy right
@_date: 2019-06-22 15:35:09
I actually would love that! Jan/Feb my liquidity sucked so I couldn't buy as much as I wanted to (bought a bunch in Oct/Nov around 5/6k mark). Have a bit of spare cash floating around now but 11k is a risky mark lol...
@_date: 2015-02-13 18:22:52
Wouldn't recommend. 
@_date: 2015-02-13 18:22:14
Fuck purse.io
They'll do a good job on 9 transactions then rip off 1 completely. That way no one can say they're messing around.
@_date: 2015-02-17 05:23:59
If it really is your card, buy the coins via any site that asks for your personal info. After you get your coins, tumble them. When they come out the other side, you're pretty much in the clear and your personal info has no link to those coins, do with them as you please.
