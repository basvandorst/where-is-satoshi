They all do have local currencies that are regulated. Value of fiat is determined by strength of the economy if not backed by a physical asset. Countries with weak/highly variant economies on an annual basis are in a precurious position. Their individual philosophy is why they have highly variant economies. Iran for example is an oil based economy, a banana republic, that demands authoritative centralized control. Their economy is overall weak because of their system, but leadership deems it necessary to advance islamic ideology. A centralized crypto would be the same as fiat. All about control.
Now the government of a country such as Iran always has control. If the currency declines in value, exports will increase as the labor costs on a global scale decrease. Government of Iran wins by taxing exports even if the people suffer. They don't care.
Decentralized crypto becomes a global store of value as government decisions do not effect savings/net worth as easily.

They change the way they tax. Sales tax instead of Income. Still get the dough, but banks lose power. No reason to store money in a bank that loses 3% annually. Banks have to post savings account rates better than inflation or die. Game over.

I don't think they could do anything if they even wanted to. Crypto lets us transact overseas and back in seconds. Really the only true legal tender is gold/silver coins. Article 1, Section 10 No State shall make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts. US isn't currently paying debts in gold, all fiat.

Institutional investment around the bend. Fidelity, Etrade... Plus block halving 2020 may. Cards are in growth for 1.5 years.

Ha... I'd like to watch as they load up their first search results... And when it sinks in they have no idea what money is.
