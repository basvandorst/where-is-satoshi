This chart could have been great, but the bias in some of the assertions renders it less respectable.

I don't know how I will respond yet.  I'm guessing maybe that I'll recheck my past returns over the next week, losing hours every evening (GRRRRRRRRRR), and then send them a polite letter saying that "Everything looks find on my end, please add that to my file or whatever."
@_date: 2019-07-26 21:57:39
They can still put me through an audit, which is a hell of a lot of hours and cost.  Only to then find out that I paid everything.  I read that something like half of audits end up with the taxpayer owing either nothing additional, or getting more money back.

I mean that's great and all, but these letters are coming after a lot of people who not only did the right thing about paying taxes, but they did so in 2013.  My own trading of bitcoins stopped by 2015, and I paid taxes on everything, yet I got the letter anyway.
@_date: 2019-07-28 17:00:14
You're not out of the woods yet.  From what I read, the letters will continue to be printed and going out for a few more weeks.

I don't think someone who traded $2000 ten times over a year is a whale or day trader.  I think that is a lot of average people messing with bitcoins at that time.

Didn't realize about the link.  Seems to be working now.

Coinbase revealed a lot more accounts outside those parameters when they first caved in to the IRS a few years ago.
@_date: 2019-07-27 01:24:57
Just guessing its the 2017 dump.
@_date: 2019-07-25 22:19:54
Yeah I just got it too.  Not sure why they think I did something wrong, since I believe I'm one of the few that reported everything the whole way.  I'm guessing they got this info from when Coinbase revealed its customers and cooperated with IRS.  I'm not sure what to do next since 6174-A basically is accusing me of committing a crime, and I'm pretty sure I didn't.  At the very least, this is going to be a massive tax on my time, and maybe a massive tax going straight to an accountant to help me refile whatever small thing I might have missed.
@_date: 2019-07-25 22:45:53
Letter 6174 says they know you have crypto and may not have reported correctly.  Letter 6174-A says they believe you misreported and may or may not take enforcement action.  Letter 6173 says they not only believe you misreported, but that they are in fact coming after you.
@_date: 2019-07-25 22:58:55
Maybe.  I see the 6174 as the fishing letter, and 6174-A as something more serious than that.
@_date: 2019-07-29 01:27:39
The letter I got just strongly suggests that I've done something illegal, yet offered no more information than that I should refile if I did.  There's nothing to sign.  Anyway I paid all my tax, so them trying to scare me like this makes me angry.
@_date: 2019-07-26 21:50:35
Many of us DID pay our taxes and that's why we're complaining.  You should edit your "tl;dr" to simply say "Didn't read, but want some attention, so will make unrelated comment."

Trump hates Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-29 15:29:13
You and me are in the same boat.  I do feel a little better.  Gonna re-check my returns, but once I'm sure I did everything right, I'm think I'm done worrying about this.
@_date: 2019-07-29 22:26:23
Thank you sincerely for coming back to update us.
@_date: 2019-07-26 05:11:33
Thanks for the diatribe, but I did pay my taxes on my bitcoin transactions.
@_date: 2019-07-25 23:54:53
I haven't traded a bitcoin in a few years now, and don't even know what you're talking about.
@_date: 2019-07-26 22:01:39
This is valuable info.  Thank you for sharing.
@_date: 2019-07-29 01:29:30
I'm one of the ones who paid all my tax.  Yet I did move the coins to a private wallet for a while.  I think this is why I got the letter.
@_date: 2019-07-26 21:59:33
I seem to have been one of the few who actually reported basis back then, from reading about how a lot of people have done it.
@_date: 2019-10-08 13:27:09
That's what I did too.  Anyway, my understanding is this.  So this is only a guess.  I think the IRS has no way to know whether that was a movement between yourself, or between you and someone else, so they assume the worst.  What you did does not count as a sale or taxable event.  Yet the IRS will probably assume that it was.

I got the email, and it went to spam.  Had to find out here and then go digging for it.
@_date: 2018-02-24 08:05:17
Mine too.  Had to dig it out of spam folder.  A lot of people are going to miss that letter if coinbase doesn't send out physical copies.  
@_date: 2019-09-12 03:45:56
Well, an accountant would say yes.  But I know that I personally wouldn't bother with reporting it, since it is a loss, and a small one at that.  The IRS could only lose if deciding to care about it.

So has he abandoned the idea of paying users?  That was my only interest in this browser to begin with.
