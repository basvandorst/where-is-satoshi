It was good when they had btc trading but they were losing too much money so they removed it. Crazy seeing this but the owners seem to be being transparent. SEC is on a roll today, first Elon, now this.
@_date: 2018-09-06 03:01:41
I planned on selling/buy a game but thats it.
@_date: 2017-12-29 12:04:18
Thank you so much this is very easy/pleasure to read as well. Question, so if i bought and built a new pc cause my old one was laggy and it helps with crypto, can i claim it as a deduction lol?
@_date: 2018-09-28 06:52:15
The copy trading was good for the crypto only traders though, they still havent remade all the features.
@_date: 2018-05-11 22:01:44
yeah, at least here in usa cash says right on it what its good for.
@_date: 2017-08-05 06:02:48
i do not have enough. I sold 3/4s at 2k to make myself feel better about losses lol.
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:59:49
Enough To 15x my investment lol.
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:11:33
Which Is What Im Saying
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:44:20
I have actually tripled my btc through a site that lets you trade, granted I was copying someone else but its so successful they removed the BTC stocks cause the website was hemorrhaging money through fees and no gains from profits due to a bad model. I can mention the site but I would not explain unless i can plug my refferal link lol. Making myself better as Warren Buffet says. Granted I did lose more than I gained in the end cause I knew nothing about normal stocks and got wrecked.

It can be harder to buy a older car than a new one depending on your wants. Also he must spend more finding someone who can say he is getting a good deal rather than a hidden problem. Also theres a rich eccentric guy I can not recall that was crazy yet very rich, he did do things wrong and a lot of people have their own quirks.
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:58:50
In their own way it suits them cause shes old and nokias are near unbreakable and I never see her complain about it but you are right they stick with old sentiments rather then think about new ones.
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:57:26
Did you see it was cause I stuck around when bitcoin was removed? You also say its my website but I wish cause they making bank and losses. I shouldn't included the losses cause they were separate from bitcoin and I was trying to warn you about considering it if you did, so fuck me for that right?  They made a new page for crypto only and its probably going to be the same before the removal if the bitcoin doesnt die somehow.
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:53:21
Ive known about it since it was worth in the dollar amounts but I saw a BTC only sportsbetting website and my opinion was that the election of trump. Was going to cause a price surge due to bored rich people, if you disagree that was my logic and I was not wrong so idk. I also once tried talking about buying bcash at 1200 long before this sub accepted it and coinbase sold it and was told to fuck off cause bcash is trash. Some people use a magic eight ball and I use empty logic lol, they say the brave and fools get money.
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:28:29
Or get another job to occupy you enough to forget about your btc.
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:18:55
I bought at 3k and feel the same cause anything over my starting point is fine.
@_date: 2017-09-04 06:05:07
so is he almost retired at that point?
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:03:35
Vanguards and shit but you know theirs studies on how the "professionals" are about as accurate as a dart throw at a board studies prove that the majority lose money in the long run. Idk what your saying. Warren Buffet invested and held to businesses? My small experiance was the majority of peopled killed the predictions and made money from levaraging bitcoin but they left and the majority of traders who played with those stocks got slayed and theirs new people each month at the top.
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:17:08
Yeah in my case I was helping my dad 60 hours a week while going to college which he annoyed me about. The thing I disliked was his rude reaction to the point Im not willing to ever help him and focus on my own income rather than his. Its aggravating when I think about it cause random ass people asked for loans and he had no evidence on success of them but still gave way more than he had to.
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:33:23
Theres new cars that are very safe and better for older people to use and he does not spend his mass fortune on one that compliments him so yeah its a bit wrong. I am saying tesla cause im biased but I hear they are the safest in the world.
@_date: 2017-09-04 06:08:45
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:18:26
My dream is a tesla the 35k one lol.
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:23:22
Yeah I know Coke will likely out business the Anti-Christ but its a example about how no business means no money to pay for thos multinational things.
@_date: 2017-09-04 06:09:05
So is she also going to be giving out free $10 in tokens.
@_date: 2017-09-05 22:24:22
To the moon to me is when the majority of Bitcoin adopters think 1 BTC is an outrageous price and maybe unobtainable for their income.
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:49:56
Ouch lol its why I take anything from reddit with a rock of salt. I was using a copy trading site using crypto and made almost 3x until they removed btc but they made a seperate page with it now and im excited to hopefully make a killing a again
@_date: 2017-09-03 13:47:32
so many free $10, i wonder how they are even going to be worth anything.
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:24:27
I agree my mom says the same when spews offences about her (divorced). If he would of played along like he does with anything before, I would probably and him also be wealthy as fuck well enough to not worry about money but to him thats not life but I cant judge.
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:15:02
Well pyrimad scheme and "good" product sound similar at comparison you made dont you say. If someone for example (play along) Coke with its massive infrastructure, were to stop having buyers and thus no money, they will have to close things down cause the bottom is feeding them money to grow and operate so anybody whos invested into Coke will get fucked probably same with bitcoin. Bitcoin seems more like a optimistic idea rather than pyrimad although theres a post saying studies prove that one dude controlled the price so your right there. Im in college and when I finish Uni ill most likely not have any debt and even have a savings which seems rare as fuck. The reason I made bitcoin profits was me saving all the money from childhood and feeling correct in that it did not seem to likely to crash from 700.
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:36:07
Hindsight matters a lot though, I sold most of mine at 1900 but rebought at 3k and missed out like I was asking (poorly) on buying B cash before the coinbase caused spike. Oh well though right? Thing is my dad was pestering about investments and how he has too much money to be in a savings bank account.
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:36:49
My dad refused a bitcoin investment at 700 each cause of the same sentiment about how it was a stupid future attempt, i did and made 15x. My dad then proceeds to let anyone who wants borrow money for no interests and has been defaulted a lot but idk he is successful through insane amount of work. My grandma still uses a nokia.
@_date: 2017-10-27 07:10:35
Probably why the forks are useful?
@_date: 2017-09-04 08:02:35
He started an ICO what lol, nice iguess.
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:27:20
I actually agree with him although he may be very misinformed, being rich does not make you smart.
@_date: 2017-09-05 22:22:41
Bill may be rich now.
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:31:00
Im just useing the gains to hopefully start my own thing, I use it to pay for stuff I flip. Im just preaching about what worked for me cause it did.
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:32:24
Ehh if you can predict bitcoin price changes you can retire early so its not a bad thing. In a way your making the better choice using the stock market of bitcoin by giving it traffic, so its just applies differently.
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:44:44
Ehh he also said he does not understand bitcoin which is what i am refering to. Also I probably have more money saved and no debt even after college compared to a large majority. Maybe you are projecting.
@_date: 2018-07-26 23:14:46
My dad asked me for investments 2-3 years ago and I brought up bitcoin when it was 700ish each. His response was getting angry calling it fake money and im a lazy loser for considering it, he also said it was embarrassing for him to have a son like me who collects fake money. At the time all I thought was no was fine but nope he also refused to let me access the $ he said was mine in another bank that I needed his approval to remove (I think). I also wondered what the fuck his idea of "investments" is if crypto is also useful for [purse.io]( discounts cause he buys a lot of stuff. My dad is not supportive of my hopes.
@_date: 2018-04-05 06:17:20
I would if I could lol.
@_date: 2017-07-15 11:36:48
i would be semi retired if i bought eth at 10$ when i wanted to buy btc at 700 lol.
