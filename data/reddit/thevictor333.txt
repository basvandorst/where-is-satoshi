One of the masterminds behind Counterparty, xnova, is developing an HTML5 based, decentralized online wallet that is akin to having Electrum running from a browser.
The implications of this are enormous because that means that even users with HTML5 capable smartphones and basically, users across all types of platforms will be able to send and receive Bitcoins without having to worry about someone stealing their BTC under the pretext of an issue with the Bitcoin protocol.
Besides that, Counterwallet will also be used as a platform for issuing and sending user-created assets and XCP, which is Counterparty's native currency.
For more technical details, I recommend you guys check out their thread with development updates at the Counterparty Forums here:

I would like to quote my favorite American politician, Ron Paul when it comes to taxes:
"Strictly speaking, it probably is not necessary for the federal government to tax anyone directly; it could simply print the money it needs. However, that would be too bold a stroke, for it would then be obvious to all what kind of counterfeiting operation the government is running. The present system combining taxation and inflation is akin to watering the milk: too much water and the people catch on."
'Nuff said.

I totally belong in that class. I rediscovered Bitcoins that same month last year after the surge and I'm never looking back.
Oh, and these crashes don't mean crap to me, but it's easy for me to say that since I don't even own a full Bitcoin yet. I'm 100% bullish on BTC and I view these crashes as a buying opportunity. I even get bummed out when I don't have any cash at hand during a crash. I think a Rothschilds said once, "buy when there's blood on the streets... even if it's your own."

Just keep it all on paper wallets and sweep the balance into Electrum, the QT client, or Blockchain.info when you want to spend it. Seriously, it should only take 2 minutes of your time to import the keys.
While you're waiting for your spent coins to confirm, you can easily create new paper wallet addresses to send the change to or have them prepared before hand.

And remember that some trolls are also paid to troll as revealed in Glenn Greenwald's heavily reddit-censored article, "How Covert Agents Infiltrate the Internet to Manipulate, Deceive, and Destroy Reputations."
I wouldn't doubt it for one second that some of the anti-Bitcoin trolls on this subreddit may actually be hired by those with vested interests in keeping fiat currencies relevant.
The OP has a good idea though. Implementing such a list on the side bar would give them less ammo to troll with.

Why do we have taxes when there's quantitative easing? To quote my favorite politician of our time, ""Strictly speaking, it probably is not necessary for the federal government to tax anyone directly; it could simply print the money it needs.

Fuck taxes. Everyone that's been indoctrinated since birth into believing that we need them and blindly buys into government propaganda and rhetoric in favor of them, needs to wake up and realize how corrupt the Corporate US of A is.

It's possible, but if you're sending to an offline-generated cold storage address, no amount of malware can steal your BTC unless the malware itself prevents you from making this transaction or MITMs the transaction and relays it to another address.
If you even suspect your computer's been compromised, you shouldn't be handling Bitcoins on it.

You're all lucky bastards because I've purchased every single one of my Bitcoins through Localbitcoins and paid way above market value for them. All because I live in a 3rd world country with crappy banks that can't even process simple international transfers and the ones that do, want to charge ridiculous amounts to execute them. Not to mention, the nightmare it is to get an account verified on many exchanges from my country.

Any ways, here's that Ron Paul tax quote again.

I fucking hate taxes because they undermine universal human rights and sovereignty.

You got it. It can't be bruteforced since the passphrase isn't stored online or on the servers. However, your wallet passphrase is stored in your browser's memory so if you wipe out your cache, you lose your wallet. This may not make it ideal to use with your browser in private mode or quite possibly with Tor.

I've only used Localbitcoins so far and it's very easy, however, the marked up prices are a nightmare. I've never bought a bitcoin at market value since I discovered it due to not being able to open up a bank account in Dominican Republic that can let me wire to one of the major exchanges.

You're right. I was thinking about the USB possibly malfunctioning in the future the whole time I wrote that, but I was going with the OP's USB storage method since that what he prefers. 
A waterproof and tearproof, laminated Teslin paper wallet is the best non-electronic cold storage method I can think of. Just print your keys on that, put it in an airtight container, and bury that bad boy somewhere no one will think of finding it.
If time capsules from over a hundred years ago can be dug up with letters that still have legible text on them, then this method of paper wallet cold storage should be good for decades.

When Russia starts implementing their anti-sanction policies and starts colluding with China, and the US dollar subsequently starts free falling in value, I'm going to feel schadenfreude at all these rappers talking about the millions in their bank accounts.
I'd love to see all of these rappers faces after a Cypriot style bank run, a normal prelude to an inevitable economic collapse. Their normalcy bias and head-in-the-sand attitudes will give them a false sense of financial security while quantitative easing continues raping their purchasing power.
It's going to remind me of that chapter in World War Z, where the celebrities had their mansions broken into by people trying to survive the zombie hoards, despite all of the security they put up.
And every nation that depends on the dollar, like my country does, will suffer collateral damage for economic cocksucking. But I will rise from the ashes unscathed, while chaos prevails around me.

Andreas' too smart. As a prominent Bitcoin spokesperson, he must feign statism to appease those behind the curtains that would seek to oppress us. Similar to what Winston did in 1984 when he used to get "riled up" about about Emmanuel Goldstein propaganda.
Deep down... he's an anarcho-capitalist and was probably laughing on the inside when he said that. In the Art of War, deception is very important. You can't let the enemy know what your stance is on any subject related to the benefit of the enemy, especially when the enemy is watching.

LMAO! That is overkill, but you can never be too careful when it comes to Bitcoins. Seriously, all you need to do is:
1. Create a signature verified Tails Live CD
2. Download bitaddress.org from Github onto a freshly formatted USB stick
3. Create a text file containing the addresses and private keys generated with bitaddress.org
4. Use Truecrypt or GPG to encrypt that text file and save it on the USB stick. 
Please note, however, that the Tails developers plan on discontinuing support for Truecrypt in the future, so you'll have to use GPG instead.

I'm in Dominican Republic so the first Bitcoin ATM here is yet to exist. I'd like to be the first person to set one up, but I'm so bullish on Bitcoin that I wouldn't want to sell them at all and when I do spend them, it's during cases where I would've made the purchase with fiat any ways.
Seriously, what happens if you own a BTC ATM with a couple of thousand dollars worth of Bitcoin in them, and there's a flash crash one day? I think it would suck if someone went out there and emptied out your ATM at those low prices and it would suck even more when the price inevitably rises again. Unless there's some kind of price guarding mechanism in place in the machine, Bitcoin ATMs will always have this risk.
