It is. Think outside the US. Also gets around kyc. Taxes?

Coinbase was the cheapest exchange in the world today. They are clearly trying to suppress the price. Bad actors. CME Futures manipulation. They could be wash trading. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 09:56:23
This dip occurred exactly when Gemini went down for maintenance at midnight. Clearly shows they are causing the problem.
@_date: 2018-01-07 10:19:26
No doubt risky. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 08:38:26
How? Ohhhhh!

23 Trillion in Debt.  How else do they manage it?  The only way is to cause inflation AND deflate the value of USD.
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:32:54
This is the only stock I trade now. I live GBTC. Liquid. Low float. Easy technicals. Bitcoin Futures. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:34:24
Those years were the worst in Bitcoin history.  What if u lost money?  Is it a write-off?
@_date: 2017-12-25 11:40:20
Bitcoin is a bubble like Facebook is a bubble. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:27:25
I like Coinbase. Always have. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 11:36:20
Buy 150k more. Average down. Break even. Sell half. Trust your instincts. Know 2020 halves the Bitcoin Award. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:39:40

This is a Land grab before options trading starts in September. Also governments and corporations buying Bitcoin too. 200 Billion in 1 yr easily 
@_date: 2017-08-13 05:27:29
Same!! I gave him Coinbase and 100. Now he has 150. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 20:15:47
I moved to Bittrex exchange. Received BCash. Sold today for more Bitcoin. Free money. Wallets are tricky. Don't trust them. Other than Bitcoin Core on pc. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:32:57
Thanks ! Great video 
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:41:24
ETF are exchange traded funds! Derivative. Mostly fake.
They don't hold actual Crypto assets. Only one I like is $GBTC. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 20:17:54
They may disperse BCash to record holders of Aug 1. Win. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 03:43:44
Finally someone calls out how bad gold has been over last year. Dollar down. Gold down. It's broken. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 18:23:54
Oh hell yeah. I love it!! I want one. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 01:59:25
It is older. 2016. Doesn't paint Bitcoin in the greatest light. Focusing more on past issues. But does point out the massive hypocrisy with Fed regulators that all started their own Crypto consulting business in private sector.  I just watched it with my wife. She was a little confused. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 19:38:23
Are U with the IRS? 
@_date: 2017-08-02 02:48:45
Yes. I tried to buy Bitcoin today in the am. They reversed it. Luck for me Bitcoin dropped. So now I can buy cheaper. Honestly I'm impressed with Coinbase. 
@_date: 2019-08-17 20:50:24
I know. So? Look at silver.
@_date: 2019-08-16 19:59:58
But look what happened last time when CME Futures came. They pumped and dumped it. How is this different?
@_date: 2019-06-21 08:14:28
The manipulators move it out of the way. After they long 25x on Bitmex.
@_date: 2019-06-21 21:34:36

What happens if you buy Bitcoin on Coinbase but don't receive them until after the fork? I would say your screwed because of limits. Local btc won't sell that much. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:10:43
Bitcoin Core has a wallet. But Trezor is best. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:19:01
Lol. Fake Gold all over. Gold is done. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:15:37
US based. Just pay the fee and buy now. U don't have time to transfer usd and then buy Bitcoin before the Nov 16 fork. I have been on Coinbase over a year. Why didn't I buy more I say every time. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:08:25
It's called buying the breakout. Momentum play. I bought more highs then I can remember. Just buy more if it dips. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 03:24:16
TD Ameritrade. Think or Swim. Look no further. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:12:58
That's a win for Bitcoin.  I know one of you hacked his computer. Bitcoin rules.

Transfer to GDAX free and get no fee limit orders. Joy. 
@_date: 2019-04-18 04:34:43
Just use ACH bank transfer with Gemini. Instant.

Please. It digital Gold. Store of value! Use fiat or Visa  for bread and Starbucks. No money in Micropayments. Yet. 
@_date: 2018-11-18 15:31:14
The price fluctuates.
Can the trillions in US 401k Retirement accounts be used to buy it?
@_date: 2018-11-18 14:13:59
They buy the underlying asset monthly. A basket of crypto. 
This is good I assume. Now the real question is will it have Options. Or be shortable. That's were the big traders make huge money. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 04:41:08
Thats BILLIONs pouring out of Banks and Stocks.  Just the beginning.  Millennials new money? My store of value.

What is the worst? 
@_date: 2017-09-22 21:56:20
It's just art. Draws the eye in. I don't expect people to be that ignorant to send Bitcoin to a qr on a shirt. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 03:26:06
I have a water cooled EVGA 1080TI Hybrid.  As good as it gets.  39 mh without even trying.  How much for it?
@_date: 2017-09-10 01:47:16
Be careful of mobile wallets. Some are a scam. Exchanges are relatively safe. Use Bitcoin Core wallet. But it requires u download the Blockchain. 160gb. 
@_date: 2017-09-25 20:14:50
This is a bad wallet

This changes nothing. ICOs will just move out of China. Neighboring countries will welcome the millions of dollars. This was just a misinterpretation of the older ICO notice?

Yes. Works too.  The shirt front has Bitcoin logo and QR below it centered. No other words. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:23:27
Someone bought that note pad for 3 Bitcoin right? 
@_date: 2017-10-05 23:47:23
Coinbase to Gdax. Then Ledger Nano S hardware wallet. Welcome. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 23:48:29
Nano S better. Never used bread. Only Bitcoin Core wallet. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 06:24:04
Use coinbase and gdax. Beware of third party wallets. Easy to send your btc to wrong address. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:18:02
How are fees on Ledger Nano S with Segwit? 
@_date: 2017-10-05 23:50:21
I would give to Tone Veys or World Crypto Network if I could. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 04:26:43
5k certainly. The world is watching Bitcoin now. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 19:24:21
How and where did u get Airdropped Bcash?
@_date: 2017-10-06 06:28:28
Up vote this. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 03:43:29
How many? The coins should be on the blockchain so if you have the password your ok.  U could import then to a bitcoin Core wallet I believe.  Or send them to an exchange or Ledger Nano S hardware wallet. Congrats. 
@_date: 2019-09-25 01:31:22
Bitcoin doesnt need Bakkt.
@_date: 2019-09-25 01:28:57
Volume 40000 Bitcoin on Coinbase!  Who bought those?  Top 1%?
@_date: 2017-10-30 00:43:09
Massive 48M short margin call. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 12:51:02
How can they search your phone without a warrant or cause? Coinbase etc requires a password? Ask for a lawyer before they do. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 12:58:52
"Carrying" implies outside your body I assumed. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 03:11:17
I agree.  Its debatable if it is Currency. Bitcoin is a commodity.  Like gold or diamonds. Its freedom. 
In Dubai you can walk into bank and buy gold bars. Do you have to declare that crossing? 
Side note. Sad how little gold has appreciated. So manipulated. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 03:48:03
Bitcoin just rebounded in Asia. Depends. Should rally Tues. am. As FOMO kicks in. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 12:51:33
Excellent point. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 23:48:46
It's acting like a penny low float stock. Not tied to Bitcoin price. If any other alternative comes to market this will tank. 
I had 40 at 230. Stopped out at 215. Bitcoin was 1950. 
Sell at first pop I would. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 17:41:13
Don't lie. It's 2330. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 01:33:05
Doesn't say that. It says are you carrying $10,000 or foreign equivalent? I use Mobile Pass App. 
Carrying is debatable and foreign equivalent also. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 19:34:24
Its the perfect storm.  Everyone will sell Bcash to buy more Bitcoin.  Shorts cover and WHALES move in.
@_date: 2017-07-25 00:11:52
Really? Let me get my cash ready. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 01:52:27
Same. Next week I'm pushing in a lot of my cash. This is just like 1999. Even with fork it's a win if the fees are reduced and speed increases. Fees are killing Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 00:14:19
Curious to see the result. I just ordered Nano. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 07:55:43
So If is it splits do I get 1 of each coin? 
@_date: 2017-05-25 04:13:04
How to cold store?
@_date: 2017-07-25 00:16:45
I'm so confused. I'm all Litecoin and Ethereum. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 00:33:11
Don't use Blockchain. It doesn't work well and I almost lost coins. I recommend Bittrex exchange. Or Bitcoin Core. 
@_date: 2017-05-09 22:37:50
GBTC up 23 today. Damn. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 01:32:49
Can u short BCC?
@_date: 2017-07-25 00:23:43
Now I'm worried about manipulation by the Investment banks. Like gold and silver. The Big Short. Or they buy it up huge. Goldman Sachs will inside trade the Call and Put contracts. 
Also Look at the resumes of the Ledger X staff. Algo experts. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 07:58:43
How the hell are exchanges going to keep track! 
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:57:41
You have to view bitcoin and ETH as a commodity rather than a Currency. Limited supply. 7.5 Billion humans. 21 million Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 04:46:42
The article doesn't explain how Coinbase is integrated in fidelity. Has anyone called them?
@_date: 2017-07-28 10:28:16
Bitcoin is Bitcoin. BCC is just a new coin with little hash power and support. It's a free coin to me. Does not take from the value of original. 
@_date: 2019-05-07 15:35:32
Sucks carrying gold bars. How do you know its not lead in the middle? Gold can be faked.
@_date: 2019-05-06 19:53:32

@_date: 2019-05-07 03:22:54
This was before Bitcoin. Bitcoin is new gold.
@_date: 2019-05-06 19:51:04
I am suggesting it be an annual celebration.
@_date: 2017-06-26 01:45:05
Average down. Don't sell for a loss like I did once at 600. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:43:52
None. They are improving. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:43:07
Dinner too. 6to 7. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:46:46
Would like to do this also. How is the Bitcoin Core wallet? 
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:42:24
I'm buying LTC here. Mkt cap so low. Limited supply. Segwit. And holding 1 btc. 
@_date: 2019-05-18 21:41:14
Or the 800 to 500.00 bubble. Every dip a buying opp.
@_date: 2019-05-07 03:27:33
Serious question. Are drug cartels buying crypto?
@_date: 2017-06-13 15:17:56
Is Armory safe? 
@_date: 2017-07-25 02:36:18
Yes.  Coinbase seems confused about the issue.  So just to be safe I switched. This will all be history in a week.  Like 1999 computer crashes that never happened.
@_date: 2019-05-07 03:26:14
J agree with this post. The next recession will create a blackhole effect as fiat collapses and crypto gains more and more mass. Stampede effect. Safe haven.
@_date: 2017-06-28 19:56:45
Awesome recovery!
@_date: 2017-06-15 21:55:18
Yes. This is quite obvious but I only buy based on the fundamentals of the currency. Litecoin has limited supply I'm told. Ethereum has DApps and Tokens for fund raising massive capital globally. Bitcoin was first. 
@_date: 2017-06-04 00:46:27
What he said! Always wondered. 
@_date: 2017-06-28 19:58:04
Are use coinbase. Get verified. First step. Do not hesitate to buy on the dip's
@_date: 2019-05-06 20:02:01
He did actually sell this for close to three Bitcoins or more. He had the guts to hold that sign behind Janet Yellen during a live interview.
