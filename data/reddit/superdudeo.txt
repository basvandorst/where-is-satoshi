Someone has given them gold now. Urgh.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:30:12
You can't be, I already paid out to the 500th
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:38:28
Can we give it a break with these shitposts?
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:49:28
There’s no reason for you to be paying fees. Join the uk bitcoin sub.
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:47:12
Isn't the pound kind of irrelevant though? Most purchases will be with USD or Euros.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:49:38
but what is the dip? That's the question?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:55:20
stupid plan more like
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:16:08
Its mega cringe I know
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:24:53
Another shitpost.
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:44:59
If you go into any specific crypto currency sub they will all say the same thing. Highly untrustworthy.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:58:29
Jumping in 500 EU amounts. I reckon its going down to 12k
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:20:20
Based on complete guesswork like 99.9% of comments in here
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:41:18
Is that the limit into Revolut? I just did multiple transactions, I think my limit might have gone up after the first transaction. I haven’t had any issues with that yet and only just started using it, just sent across a thousand euros a few days ago, no problem.
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:15:33
Why don’t you try doing it? It’s not instant transferring, that’s the issue.

What do you think is the best crypto to invest in after bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:02:19
1 bitcoin goes to the 500th subscriber
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:17:33
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:34:17
Have you sunk anything in to the alt coins?
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:38:18
Why not just keep your deposit on GDAX and set a limit?
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:39:37
That's the beauty of limits, just got in by the looks of it
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:24:15
It would tell you if there would be a fee
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:38:44
Kind of feel the same way but not quite as brave as you. It's a case of go big or go home. I want a return that will make a difference not just a few thousand.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:05:41
I love the way everyone who sells up says there's going to be a crash.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:51:05
what about the uk sub?
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:42:44


BS statement
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:42:42
if you want to buy straight away yes
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:50:55
Don’t ever think coinbase is a wallet. It’s just an IOU.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:23:19
Any idea what a good buy limit would be if I set one? I can't sit and watch GDAX all day!
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:19:16
Yeah that’s the one. It’s weird, I send two lots, one to ‘myself’ with my own name and then another to Coinbase ltd which is the correct payee name. Guess which one goes a lot faster? So I only send funds using my name now.
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:56:59
Another clickbait shitpost
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:43:52
How much have you invested out of interest?
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:41:45
hold on for dear life
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:22:05
amen to that, sick of it
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:51:29
Why would you buy at 17?
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:56:24
There aren't psychological barrriers for people who aren't really trading in Sterling. I'm from the UK, everyone converts it to buy. It's not a milestone, there won't really be a wall there.
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:45:30
I’ve set a few limits, when it dropped a few days ago, for a brief period you could have bought at around 8. That’s the beauty of limits.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:54:14
It's not a wallet
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:48:58
Can’t see it myself, it’s not cheap enough any more so interest will just drop off
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:00:15
what do you think will happen when futures comes?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:57:24
Not in any definition of a wallet it can't.
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:07:45
Don’t get me wrong, I’m a noob but it would depend on how much you have invested. Also you have to ask yourself, what your goal is. Most people are sitting on it waiting for high gains so who cares if you bought at 8 or 10 when bitcoin goes to 100k? Gavin said that, if I had invested at 10k for 1 bitcoin I would probably set a limit of 10.5 to sell and then set another limit of around 9. Easily achievable right now.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:42:30
Sure, I have limits set but the price just keeps going. Just wondered what you think a sensible limit would be to buy if it dips.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:35:17
What do you think a good limit would be to buy at? I can't stare at GDAX all day long!
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:07:31
Question is, do you buy some etherium whilst it’s still low also?
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:04:19
Have you tried topping up multiple times at 200 pound a time?
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:46:06
This time it’s personal!
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:49:58
I just top up on Revolut using a debit card, I think it’s instant.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:23:35
Any idea what a good buy limit would be if I set one? I can't sit and watch GDAX all day!
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:49:35
Is Bitcoin going to go up or down when futures arrives? 
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:03:14
I think you’re a bit confused. GDAX buying and selling is instant. You don’t need to wait for any bank accounts. However, the wait period is getting the money into GDAX but this isn’t an issue for this person.
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:08:55
No all online. There’s a YouTube video of the process in the uk sub.
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:40:35
What do you mean support?
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:36:24
What is the daily limit?
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:52:12
I think the issues you're having will be ironed out but it might take another year. It's certainty troubling when Bitcoin isn't that new anymore. I'm trying to work out if there will ultimately only be one crypto in the future or any of the others are likely to take off.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:30:49
I have money waiting on GDAX but no way am I buying at this price
@_date: 2019-08-02 13:13:30
The new definition of trolling is having a different opinion to someone. That’s how bad it’s got.
@_date: 2019-08-13 15:35:37
Fuck off with these shitty memes
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:40:48
I can’t figure out the cheapest way of buying amounts of around 1000 dollars at a time. Coinbase has set my limit to 325. Any help would be appreciated. Also, I do have an ATM near me but I thought they were a rip off with their high fees?
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:00:33
So coming from a complete noob, is the coin base app a good way to invest in it?
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:09:42
Watch this for limit buying:
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:34:31
So a TLDR Eli5 would be- don’t try and be a smart arse, getting on the ladder is more important than when you get on the ladder?
@_date: 2017-04-01 22:17:34
The same way as you go into a casino with cash and then bank out with your 'winnings'. Bitcoin fluctuates so often that you could claim you got lucky.
@_date: 2017-11-30 11:04:16
I'm limit buying right now but waiting for funds to transfer
