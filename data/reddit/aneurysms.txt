Thanks for this post. These are all ideas I've been reluctant to consider for some time, and I appreciate your clarity.

"Real" is a totally unjustified answer. Making a appeal to nature makes you look silly. Provide qualitative evidence that this can't work, otherwise you're relying on gut impulses, like bitcoin skeptics that make misinformed claims.

You don't need science to experience reality, but you do need it to make a positive statement about "real" food versus Soylent. You need to expose the actual shortcomings in Soylent that make it not live up to its subjective benefits to a consumer. Otherwise you haven't proved anything.

They're not anonymous, but pseudonymous; the transaction could be traced back to you by a dedicated enough party. New infrastructure like ZeroCoin will have to be implemented to achieve true anonymity.
However, your original point stands. If everyone used Bitcoin, criminalizing it would be akin to enforcing the criminalization of BitTorrent.

Only if you constantly put your coins through mixing wallets on secure computers on Wi-Fi hotspots that can't be traced to you. That's about as good as you can do right now. Seriously, look up ZeroCoin, it will solve that problem once it gets developed.

Nice ad hominem you got there.

Some may be "playing the market" like throwing dice, but that does not diminish the value of any entrepreneur who decides to invest in bitcoin. Speculators provide a real service, and they take on the risk of failure like every single other free-market enterprise.  Speculating in bitcoin is as "real" a job as running a blog for ad revenue, because it is an investment of scarce time and resources. Hating someone for providing a service, voluntarily, needs to have some other basis in some concrete principle which you have yet to provide.

Not quite. I'm talking about tracing someone through their transactions. The protocol itself knows nothing of your ip address, but since all transactions are on a permanent public register, someone buying from a service using their real name could have their identity attached to their transactions for all time. Disguising your ip is still a good idea for the reasons you're thinking of, though.

It's not right to say that it was just speculators; it was an increase in aggregate demand by speculators and tangentially interested people who learn about btc and like it. The Google trends tracking reflects the bubble precisely, with references to recent articles that may have helped spur it.
