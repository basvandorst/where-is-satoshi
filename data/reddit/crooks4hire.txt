BITCOIN FLASH SALE!!! BUYBUUBUY!!!!!
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:35:09
That's correct. And the world-at-large treats bitcoin as a pyramid scheme while people who truly understand it back it as a currency. That's why the "value" of bitcoin is currently measured by how much fiat someone is willing to pay for it.
Bitcoin is currently a pyramid, bubble, jenga tower, whatever the fuck you wanna call it. Keyword = currently. The bubble will pop eventually, there will be mass exodus. But the coin will survive.
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:18:58
Because not everyone understands that keyword. That's why crypto is so volatile: the price is 5% below your buy-in...currently. The typical move is to sell. That's why you see flash sales happen.
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:21:17


Because you can see the coin move from wallet to wallet. Not from user to user. If it wasn't anonymous, then there would be absolutely no problem tracking down the hackers that seem to be breaching security protocols every few weeks.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:07:17
Really? Bitcoin is a currency based on anonymity, privacy, and eluding government control and regulation.
I'm not saying "It's my coin and you can't have any!!!"  I'm saying "It's my coin and the government will NOT tell me what to do with it!!!"

Because miners process higher fee transactions first on a set 10min per block schedule. Low fees get buried and build up until high fees get cleared.

@_date: 2017-12-07 18:21:10
There's the argument of sustainability and the argument of useability. There's 35% swings in value scare off corporate adoption of bitcoin as a currency. The world is adopting bitcoin as a stock (store of value) not as a currency.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:53:05
You're trading token values on GDAX. Your bitcoin is not realized until you attempt to withdraw it. There is always the possibility that GDAX has spent/lost/embezzled/stolen/destroyed/etc the coin you invested into the exchange and will be unable to supply it to you when you request to withdraw it.
@_date: 2018-09-11 10:50:59


I'm listening to (reading) all of these comments with an open mind. Don't stop preaching. I'm particularly interested in the simple methods you mentioned above. I have ~~very little~~ no experience with TA...to the point where I can't even tell if a TA is/was successful vs. just a lucky break.

To me, he didn't seem unhappy with the money he made. He seemed unhappy with the losses incurred (however great they may be) from listening to FUD.
@_date: 2018-08-22 19:27:43
Ok, this makes a lot more sense to me now. I guess I grossly overestimated bitcoin's progress as a secure store of value; and, as a result was worried that it was in danger of being pigeon-holed by misguided regulations (kind of a cart-before-the-horse scenario).
@_date: 2018-05-08 11:02:11
No that's pretty much a fact. You can't "store value" if you can't predict the value of your storage medium. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 16:16:44
The danger I worry about is that bitcoin ends up getting regulated (in the US at least) as an asset whose value is tied to USD. The US already taxes it as a capital investment in the form of capital gains taxes.

@_date: 2018-08-22 17:34:25
Idk what concern trolling is.
This is the perspective I'm talking about. Bitcoin having a "price level" is grounding its value in fiat. 
I don't see the future of bitcoin being: "I will trade you 1 bitcoin for a sandwich because 1 bitcoin = 1 dollar." 
I see: "I will trade you 1 bitcoin for a sandwich because 1 bitcoin = 1 sandwich."

@_date: 2018-08-22 16:55:57
Def not trolling.
No, I worry that US regulations might have a significant negative impact on adoption due to bitcoin's current perception as being a digital investment rather than functioning as a currency.
@_date: 2018-05-07 22:50:52
Yea a lot of people tout bitcoin as a "sure thing" when it just isn't. It CAN be rendered obsolete by a better coin, and users need to be aware of that.
However, we need to do something to move away from the mentality that bitcoin is an investment. It is intended to be a currency
@_date: 2018-05-08 02:54:28
Because risky assets are not stores of value. A store of value requires a substantial amount of stability. You wouldn't call a box full of unscratched lottery tickets a store of value... 
Bitcoin (any crypto for that matter) cannot function as a store of value when it's value is so volatile. 
@_date: 2018-05-08 13:39:05
Within reason, yes. Cmon, you guys can't seriously be arguing that the price of bitcoin is stable enough to be used as a store of value at this time. 
When was the last time gold double in value and subsequently lose 70% of its value in a single quarter in a stable market?
@_date: 2018-05-08 17:18:53
In this context, value is the usefulness of bitcoin as a transaction medium (or the willingness of society to trade goods and/or services for bitcoin). 
Bitcoin and fiat both have no "inherent value"...only the value that the community at large places on them. Bitcoin is *currently* not a store of value because of its volatility. If you had bought, invested, stored value in, or [insert preferred verbage here] bitcoin when it was at $19k+ then you would NOT consider it to be a good store of value...
As someone stated elsewhere in the comments, adoption mandates the value of bitcoin and, therefore, it's viability as a store of value. Until we see widespread adoption, bitcoin is not a good choice for storing value.
@_date: 2018-08-23 10:39:15
That's exactly the danger I'm concerned about. People are treating it as a static investment rather than a fluid currency. I don't want regulation to make that treatment permanent, and I feel like things like the ETF will do just that.
I've never heard of an ETF for the Euro or the US dollar... Why would we want one for Bitcoin?

@_date: 2017-11-28 12:57:54
I would argue that if it's not an investment, then it can't be judged whether it's in an investment bubble or not... The only people affected by the "bitcoin bubble" and whether or not it pops are the people who are mistaking it as an investment opportunity. The popping of the bubble will not affect its viability as a currency or as a store of value. It'll just jip a whole bunch of people who bought in expecting a free ride to the moon.
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:14:50

This recent blast of growth has been a 'confidence game'. It's powered in bulk by newcomers and people thinking bitcoin is a get-rich-quick scheme. Not to mention a lot of wall-street whales coming in.

I'm not sure tbh. I just think it's odd that the backbone of bitcoin is becoming more and more centralized while decentralization is the cornerstone around which the currency is built. 
Yea the bitcoin is decentralized in the fact that the entire community will validate the transactions...but someone has to put you in the chain before that happens. 
Maybe force pools to distribute their efforts? Maybe distribute the reward across all active miners so that it's a true community effort to mine as well as validate?
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:51:58
Good for you man!! Here's to many more profitable days ahead!
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:18:23

If you say so.
Either way, it's a win-win. Bitcoin will not bottom out. Its viability has been proven. But just like all new things, it's finally seeing a mass influx of curiousity. This incredible volatility will stabilize with the establishment of a long term user-base.

TLDR - You literally can't lose by buying bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-22 12:57:09


I've more often seen people view Bitcoin (and most new technology) as fluffy and unnecessary. "We got along fine without it before".
His/Her dad comes from a time where fiat was the standard because it was "backed" by the federal reserve, aka gold. The system was/is complex enough that the layman understood enough to have a conversation about it but not much else. Now throw bitcoin at them, and you're in a situation where they just shutdown and say, "I'll stick with the evil I know, thank you".

If it fails, I want it to fail due to evolution. Due to the fact that we developed something better. Not because the 3 biggest mining pools decided to pack their bags and mine something else.

It's increasing, and it will continue to increase as more and more business accept bitcoin as a form of payment. [620 stores in South Korea have jumped on the wagon.]( 
Volume has been steady in recent months because there have been relatively few new commercial outlets for bitcoin.

I'm not totally familiar with bitfinex's security track record. That's the main reason I've avoided them up to now, there's a lot of hate on this sub revolving around Bitfinex and I'm not sure how much is justified.
Has Bitfinex had any actual security failures and/or have they facilitated any criminal activity through negligence or something? Or is everything they're blamed for similar to "someone stole a bunch of Tether and is moving it to Bitfinex so Bitfinex is shitty"?

I do have bitcoin. Currently I'm hodling because there are very few places in America that accept it as a form of payment.


Radically more expensive compared to what? USD? Euro? Zimbabwe Dollar? The mistake everyone seems to be making is that they believe the only thing giving bitcoin value is the fiat for which you can exchange it. That's because the pizza place around the block isn't accepting bitcoin for pizza...they want fiat.
Commercial adoption of bitcoin will be meaningless if it's not treated as a currency. As an American, I don't know of any business outside of exchanges that accept multiple forms of currency for their products. The ones that do accept bitcoin immediately exchange it for USD.
Bitcoin has a VERY long road before it is fully realized as the currency that it is; however, being decentralized, it has the potential to grow into a ubiquitous currency that transcends national borders. Technology is making the world incredibly small...we now have the need for a global currency that is controlled by the people - not by institutions. 
All this being said, I'm absolutely not against selling bitcoin for fiat. That's the world we currently live in, and to ignore that would be ignorant. But I believe in bitcoin's future well past the moon as a sustainable, openly accepted currency. That's why I own bitcoin.

On a related note, does overstock accept bitcoin?

Bitcoin gold / litecoin silver. I had a ltc transaction verify in about 15sec yesterday.
@_date: 2016-09-13 18:32:21
Here or there?
@_date: 2018-03-31 18:12:52
It's ok man, them days hit all of us. It felt like 15sec but was probably longer. I tried to look up the info from order time to confirmation time, but all it would give me is when the transaction received first confirmation. I can say this though, I created the account at congrevape at 12:55 and I had confirmation by 1:01!
I don't wish to spread misinformation. I'm here to learn, make money, and hopefully one day swap to 100% crypto one day :)

LMAO good point. 
On a serious note...is bitcoin mining fully out of the reach of hobbiests/amateurs? I've done some cpu/gpu mining on Nicehash, but I've avoided diving into bitcoin/litecoin mining due to what appears to be a monumental up-front investment.

It's a metaphor for relating the "difficult to solve/easy to prove" idea...not a direct explanation for how bitcoin works.
@_date: 2018-02-02 23:38:52
No. It's a virtual entity that is currently poorly regulated due to it not being tied to any seat of power. When a hard link between bitcoin and a seat of power develops (WHEN), then bitcoin will behave more predictably. Until then, it floats in a sea of speculation and social influence. You can estimate, approximate, and guess about its future...but you will not be able to reliably gauge it's behavior until it drops anchor.

Oh shit... now I gotta resist the urge to blow my HODL on overstock x.x

I'm new to the game lol. Do you mean transfer from cb &gt; gdax &gt; hardware? I am only using coinbase because I bought some BTC on it back in 2013 and would like to move it to hardware before the fork.
@_date: 2017-10-30 18:11:28
So then how do you get your bitcoin out of coinbase?

That being said, Abra is a nice way to exchange money from credit cards / bank accounts directly to crypto.

But you're not paying in dollars man. Why wouldn't the UK get a cut of that action because bitcoin has a GBP value? And Japan for the yen and every other fiat that you can value bitcoin against?

You forgot the key... The modern world is lazy and does not want responsibility. This is why we have things like the FDIC and insurance etc. The modern world would much rather pour their money down a hole as a trade-off for not having to worry about an accident or being responsible in the future.

Competition is probably why the increase in efficiency is marginal. I wouldn't be surprised if Halong is already capable of a significant increase in efficiency with the 10nm circuits, but it's throttled so as not to hit the ceiling with their first product on the market.

Because you're spending bitcoin. The only interface you had with fiat is purchasing the coins. You didn't sell anything if you're performing a bitcoin transaction.
If I trade you a rock for an $800 cellphone, we don't pay any transaction taxes...

Me too...and loafwallet somehow lost my wallet, but my seed is at home. So now I'm at work, frantically trying to remember where I stashed the seed :)
Pretty sure it's in my lockbox, but I won't relax till I hold it lol! No worries, bitcoin will rise from this stronger than before! My only regert is buying a house right before the dip so now I can't buy coin x.x
