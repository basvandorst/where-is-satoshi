It only took a minute or so for me after that message for the download to start. I suppose it depends on how quickly the service can receive the file's first chunk.


The latter

I tried, it resumes automatically

That's possible with this service, you don't *have* to use the command line script. It's all just regular HTTP to a .onion address (= end-to-end encrypted).

Man, that user experience is **gorgeous**, at least for people who don't shy away from the command line. I'm swooning it's so elegant, no more messing around with ssh+screen+rtorrent+rsync to a seedbox. Would definitely pay for this once it's out of trial.
Have you considered adding a way to download a whole torrent's contents without worrying about individual files? Maybe zipped/tarred up.
Also, a way do download the .torrent file itself so I can verify the content files' integrity and don't have to trust your service in that sense.

No, because there is no upload traffic going through Tor.

... but then your connection to the "open Internet" torrents isn't anonymous.
