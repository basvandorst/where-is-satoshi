Yeah the year questions sucked. Left most of mine blank or just guessed.
I've been in crypto since 2011 but pretty much ignored alts

That magnet might allow the floppy to slip and fall as the Bitcoins in it get heavier and heavier.
Drill a few holes and use some sheet metal screws to secure it. That should hold it.

Yup. Still have a fpga and early jally from them. Modded the jally to 8 gh/s 1st week I had it. Both still run. Well not running *now* but they do fire up.
Have a block errupter too. Ah memories. Some good, some bad. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:30:48
They do make bitcoin silver rounds. Just do a search.
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:29:33
Yup, correct. Even to the point of the passphrase functioning identically .

This. When my phone died, it was not a problem as I just put the key in the new phone.
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:51:00
Yes. It's crazy to blindly trust your ability to restore, even though a trezor forces you to verify all 24 words. Initialize, write a couple adds down. Wipe, recover, check for same addys. Seriously, do it. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:35:17
When you are at the "close account" help page at coinbase make sure to click the "like" button heh.
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:32:30
Yup, another one of the same, or the other brand. They function identically even to the point of the passphrase working the same.
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:53:47
Yup best way to do it if you have coins on it is to get a second device and restore to that. I sure wouldn't  try it with coins on it. Trezor and ledger nano s use the same protocol for the seed list (bip 39) so you use either one to check the other. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:29:13
You just import the 24 word seed into the ledger nano s. Or any bip 39 compatible software or hardware wallet. The seeds are the thing you need to protect securely, you can lose/break the trezor or leger and still recover all coins and tokens. Just follow the recovery instruction for whatever wallet you recover with.
For better security you should use a passphrase (25th word) with trezor. Same with nano s (2nd pin).

Heh I know the feeling, finally got my 2012 armory wallet password right a few weeks ago. Mined with a 6870 and 5830. And congrats to you and the op.

And hope the compiler itself isn't compromised and insert a back door when it's triggered by some byte sequence in the source code or something.

The gpu's I mine with have a better life than the gaming gpu in my daily driver. The mining cards have better airflow, are undervolted, and run at a constant temperature.

paper for long term hodl. with bip38 i have many copies stashed about. 
trezor for coins i may use in the near(ish) future. trezor makes it easy to send a specific amount rather than sweep the whole amount stored in a paper address.

Since I've paid taxes on crypto for years  I'm already in many databases. I'm very glad I did, including listing stuff I paid for in btc because sooner or later the IRS will find most all of that stuff.
Pay now, or pay fines and penalties beyond belief later.

99% sure is not enough. if it were me i would reformat and reinstall the OS. keep the old wallet.dat but rename it to something like "possibly compromised btc wallet.dat" and not use it again. of course move any remaining btc to somewhere temporarily. but i would keep it as i keep all old wallets.. maybe someone will send to that wallet or youll want to sign an addy from it or prove you had coins from somewhere on that wallet some day.
then make a new wallet, move any funds back in and post a new stake address on bct with an explanation as to why youre posting the new addy.
and seriously consider getting a hardware wallet.

Very thorough article. Gonna print it and go through it step by step.
@_date: 2017-04-08 13:53:55
true, this. ive bookmarked this thread and set a reminder on my phone to go off 13 years from today.
@_date: 2018-03-12 11:39:53
Paper wallets, when properly made and stored (and backed up securly), are VERY safe, I used them for years. Use a passphrase (bip38).
Problem is you have to trust the program/wallet that sweeps them when you cash them out to wherever. That's where the risk comes in.

Sync back free for files. Miners, blockchains, notes, wallets, whatever.
Macrium Reflect Free for disk images. So you don't need to reinstall the os when things go into the weeds. Saves a ton of time configuring a new install.
Make sure at least one copy of everything is offsite. Use at least 2 disks. One for An online disk on a network is ok for automatic runs but make sure one disk is offline. Rotate that one every week or something.
You can never have too many backups and too many offsite locations. Especially with crypto.
@_date: 2018-03-18 04:09:42
Both reasons, actually.
@_date: 2018-03-26 00:35:23
Yup I use macrium Reflect Free version. They also have a paid version but the free has everything I need.

Dumbest article ever.
You know btc algo is open source right?

Sweet. Sent ya a donation. Will send pm with TX id.
I will build this just as a backup to my trezors.

A gpu miner when *properly* set up largely is maintanence free. Aside from monitoring profit swithing maybe.  Get a good psu and cabling and hook it up right. Seems a lot of folks cheap out. I check my gpu miner once a week or so. Only maintanence is dust them every few months if needed. Need to update miners as new versions come out and sometimes yoy need to retweak the cards if theyre wound up tight with memory mods. Ive has No problems except when i got getting carried away with clocks.
Some Asics, like the s9, seem to have poor quality control. Gpu miners just run.
I mine alts and trade for btc mostly.
One main rig, aOnda b250 d8p ver 1, 8 cards, riserless. Couple 1080 tis, 1070ti, 1070, couple stapped 470/4s, and a 460/4 with the shader unlock, couple 390s but they are pretty much retired. My daily driver game machine mines occasion also.

Because the .dat file will have all the notations/comments you've entered. I've used the same wallet.dat since 2011and documented most transactions as to what it was for , and it's very useful at times
The seed will only have transactions but no details as to where it went and what it was for. 
I just copy the file to several types of media.. nas, flash, and USB harddrive. I do this file backup every month or so.

nope, it almost never leaves the house. i do bring it on vacations though.
@_date: 2017-05-02 17:15:50
cant see how that is moving money anymore than bringing a check book along is. its just a way access to my own money thats already there.
anyway i usually vacation in my own country (usa) so its a non issue but will look into this if i ever vacation out of the country.

coinbase links to my bank account. so buying is not problem, selling them is taxable if you make a profit.  at least my accountant does it that way. sell for more than i bought it for is taxable on the difference.
@_date: 2017-05-19 16:56:17
yeah its nice. found 5 btc in a paper wallet i had stashed away and forgotten about. it was like checking under the sofa cushion for change and finding a couple thousand bucks :)
@_date: 2017-05-13 11:49:07
actually here in the usa we still have a lot of medical systems running on xp for specialized medical equipment too. mostly embedded controllers for stand alone stuff but they are still networked. cost too much to replace. 
heck many offices still run xp/vista. with hardly any updates.
some IT companies do not like to update servers and systems as they are worried it will break their ehr software. sigh. so many usa medical systems are wobbling along just ripe for something like this.
some practices like the one i work at are pretty hooked up software, hardware, server wise and all patched but i fear we are the minority.
@_date: 2017-05-15 13:46:37
my theory is a few script kiddies fired this off. they probably figured they would infect a few hundred regular people.
but then it went way way beyond that. 300 USD to decrypt medical systems that effect a whole county?? they could of named any price. they are probably kicking themselves.
gonna be interesting how they will cash out to fiat. these folks are in serious trouble especially if/when they get caught especially  if people health declines in a huge way (maybe some deaths? sure hope not.)
@_date: 2017-05-02 16:47:44
why would i worry about that?
@_date: 2017-05-13 12:09:58
good call in my opinion.
i made back my initial investment long ago, back when btc was very volotile. so now the btc i play will is all profit. if it all crashes to zero tomorrow i still came out ahead by a fair amount. sure makes it easy to hodl now.
could i have made more by not selling back them? sure but i had to make sure i covered my initial investment. at this point is all just fun and profit is profit. im not greedy (well not *too* greedy anyway).
so its worked out for me.
all the crypto i have now is all profit

till this btc thing gets sorted out, i will pay in ltc. faster,cheaper. be stupid to not use ltc at this point.
that being said i am long on btc. heres to hoping it gets sorted out.
@_date: 2017-07-24 15:48:02
i get the impression that it is that software that monitors the windows clipboard for btc addys and replaces it with its own. when the user pastes the addy into the client and sends it the btc goes to the bad guys addy.
like when you copy a payment addy from a web site or store or whatever and paste it to the client you get hosed.
@_date: 2017-05-13 11:53:08
ive seen offices like that. i cringe that some my medical records are stored there.
funny enough my pcp still has paper charts. strange that their records are probably the safest ones nowadays. LONG LIVE PAPER!
@_date: 2017-05-03 00:40:55
if thats the case then when bringing my phone or a notebook with a btc wallet on it out of the country means i have to declare all my btc? seems unenforceable.
@_date: 2017-05-12 19:45:53
medical systems should be locked down with heavy security and user training. and users should not be running unvetted software and browsing facebook/ebay/whatever on medical computers.
and what happened to the hourly off site backups??
BIG IT fail on that.

if an exchange that says it is not going to support BCC sold off client BCCs wouldnt it be visible on the BCC blockchain? after all most exchanges have at least some known addresses, which would be duplicated on the BCC chain. if those coins in those addresses are sold off their credibility would go down in flames.

some. nowhere as much as if i had HODLed everything back in the day. but at that time i was trying to spend btc when i could as that was the point of it. mine it, use it as currency so it would get exposure.
@_date: 2017-06-13 13:13:58
yup been here since 2011. saw some crazy stuff.
had an account at mtgox but luckily moved the coins out via dwolla before the crash , had one of the 1st revision  bfl jalapenos (flashed to 8.5 gh/s), that one actually earned some money. cryptopia, pirate saw those it was my daily entertainment when i came home from work and logged on to follow that stuff.
sold a bunch at $30 as it was amazing at the time as i had mined around $3.00/coin back then on gpus. proved to the wife this "crazy" crypto thing could actually work.
now, i mine gpu alts and convert to btc via nicehash. i check prices maybe once a week, sometimes longer. now i just HODL as it is the best long term strategy. much less stress :)
@_date: 2017-06-13 20:42:04
archive quality CDs, 50+ year lifespan. paper wallets - laser printed and laminated. hard drives (not SSDs).
but best of all hardware wallet like trezor. 
i would use several different mediums, and distribute them several places. fire/floodproof safe, safe deposit box, even bury one if you own land.
@_date: 2017-06-29 14:57:40
i have bought three times  at overstock with btc. two used the "use coinbase account" option, and one was paid from my core wallet.
the one from the core wallet gave that message "Error: We detected your payment on the network, but it looks like the fee included might not be enough. For this reason, we're waiting for the payment to confirm before completing this order." but it did confirm withing 15 or twenty minutes.
the ones where i selected "use coinbase" were instant.
