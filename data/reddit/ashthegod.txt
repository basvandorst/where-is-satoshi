Hardwallets are backup up &amp; can be restored using a 24-random “seed” aka words you wrote down when setting up your wallet.

Yes. from the LedgerWallet site. 


         When you need to import your accounts in another compatible wallet, you must enter these 24 words in the new wallet, it will automatically synchronize all your transactions from the blockchain and shows your correct balance

Hacks, of websites, of people who keep their BTC on a web wallet. It is &amp; always will be vulnerable to hacking. That’s why hard wallets are highly recommended &amp; why i kept mine on me 24/7

Look up Ledger Nano S, it’s a hard wallet, and allows you to keep your backup offline &amp; safe. Highly recommended.
