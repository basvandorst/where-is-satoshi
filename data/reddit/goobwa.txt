Well, in fairness to the butter, the internet was adopted after years of massive government subsidies were used to create it, design the computers to run it, etc.

Give the guy a break.  In 25 years, the kid might need to buy a little pot and not have enough left over from his job at the burger joint!

They were "audited", but it wasnt a financial audit, and it wasnt done by a CPA, so to answer your question, No, they have never been audited.

This is  20 times the legal limit for consumer fireworks, which is 50 milligrams.  Also, M-80's are not legal consumer fireworks either.


Cabelas was not shipping them through the US postal system, nor storing them in an apartment.


It is illegal for anyone to ship explosives through the USPS.  To ship them through UPS or Fedex, you have to have them properly labeled as Hasmat, as well as pay the extra Hasmat shipping costs.
Apparently you were trying to save money by shipping them illegally.

I really liked this part
BitPay’s BBB rate is based on the order books of bitcoin exchanges that we vet extensively – BitPay adheres to extremely high standards of accounting and regulatory compliance. When considering a relationship with an exchange, BitPay takes into account a number of important factors including liquidity, legal and regulatory compliance, AML &amp; KYC standards, banking relationships, a visible order book, counterparty risk, and our internal auditing requirements. We require both proof of reserves and a BitPay-managed review of trading volume
Bitstamp is probably just fine, guys, they have been vetted extensively!
