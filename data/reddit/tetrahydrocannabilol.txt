Show him performance graph from 2010, $0.0025 to $1163 top in 2013. Market performance aside:
Bitcoin is safe. What is required is greater knowledge and understanding of bitcoin to avoid having your bitcoin lost of stolen, many counter-measures exist from offline paper-wallets to encrypted private keys.
Accusing heartbleed of being a bitcoin problem is a joke, Heartbleed is a problem with OpenSSL and not bitcoin. 
I hope he didn't log in to his internet banking!

I think it's a great idea, so I'm going to give you a little guide about how to go about this.
1. **Create paper wallet**
You're going to need a printer to do this. A paper wallet contains a printed bitcoin address and the private key (access to that address) is tucked away and folded.
Generate a wallet address, and print the wallet, cut out the shape - buy tamper evident holographic stickers and waterproof bags from the same site if you want.
The paper wallet is what you should gift to your son on his 18th, he can then import it using the private key to any computer using any online wallet to spend or sell his bitcoin.
2. **Buy ฿itcoin**
Once registered, you can buy a bitcoin from somebody using popular website:
 
Many people can meet in person, but using a bank transfer is quickest, easiest, and reliable using the escrow system to protect bother the buyer and seller.
The price is slightly higher, as people operate as their own 'exchange' for bitcoin on this website - but it bypasses the need for identity verification at an bitcoin exchange website like bitstamp.net, international bank transfers (in some cases) and etc. I use local-bitcoins.com and highly recommend it.
3. **Load your paper wallet**
Assuming you have gotten your paper wallet printed safely, and your bitcoins are in your local-bitcoins wallet or another online wallet:
Simply send the entirety of the bitcoin balance to the public address of your paper wallet. The public address is recognizable by the prefix of **1**.
Don't forget to account for the transaction fee's, to avoid a final balance of 0.9999.
*Make sure you understand the difference between the public address, and the private key.
DO NOT NEGLECT the importance to hide the private key.*
That makes your printed paper wallet hold the value of 1 bitcoin.
I hope you the process of bitcoin, and I'm sure your newborn will appreciate the gains made from your investment.

Erowid is a wonderful source of information, I've just given my share of mBTC to sustain such a thoughtful and useful source of drug info - all for free. It's about time I show my gratitude!
Many thanks to erowid!

When you use shared send it takes an entire input from your public address and it will send the change to a new address for additional privacy purposes.
The new address which is generated by the shared coin function should be in your wallet, with your change.
Check that you have an additional public address in your wallet which you have access to, if the balance is not showing it might have been archived somehow.
Check for any archived addresses in your wallet.
Did the shared send function properly?
There is also a button that says "**Recover Intermediate Addresses**" on the shared send webpage, in case something goes wrong.
Good luck!

Your best option is to encrypt the private key with a password of your choosing at this point. This will require you to decrypt the private key, using your password - to import the funds from the wallet.
That way, if the wallet is stolen the thief cannot import the key, and you would hopefully have a duplica laying around. (Safe deposit box is a great safe place)
EDIT: bitcoinpaperwallet.com lets you encrypt the private key with a password.

If you go to wallet home, then "Account Settings" on the right.
Hit "Export Unencrypted" on the left side menu, and check for bitcoin addresses in your possession in the exported format. Hopefully you can understand the format ;)
If you have further problems, you might of had lost the change address in some unfortunate event that makes me reluctant to use shared send again.
At this point your best option is to email support about the issue. I would take a look myself if I could - but Mandrik from blockchain has posted here and he is very helpful.

If you use blockchain.info, I'm sure you've seen the **Shared Send** option. That makes your paying public address anonymous.
Pretty sure blockchain don't correlate any public bitcoin address in your control with any IP at any given point in time.
Bitcoin is pretty anonymous.

If you buy 1 bitcoin, you have a total balance of 1.0 bitcoin.
When you send this bitcoin to another wallet, you will need at least 0.0001 unless you want the transaction to potentially take days to confirm.
That would leave a nasty 0.9999 to gift instead of a beautiful 1.0

This method can easily reveal your private key if somebody has a copy of the image file too. I would not recommend sending a considerable amount to an address generated like this unless you don't share the image file, or intend on the balance being stolen.

The bitcoinpaperwallet.com wallet generator has options to encrypt it in different formats I believe, I haven't played with it too much.

This is not an exploit. This title is fake and unwarranted.
@_date: 2017-08-02 08:58:18
Yes, is it clear. Mental gymnastics wont change the fact researchers are biased just as supporters are biased. Being a supporter of something means you are biased, you are not neutral... Not to mention how irrelevant that supporter argument is to the context of research and researchers.

I call it by it's specification, emergency difficulty adjustment. Let's face it, would the Bitcoin Cash chain be alive if EDA was not implemented? If it were BCC would probably still have 6 hour periods between blocks. I care to argue BCC chain is functional because of EDA.   
Your beleifs of scheduling are false, as blocks are generated on a probabilistic basis which does not abide by a schedule, but aims to average a block every 10 minutes, achieved through standard difficulty adjustments. The average block rate on BCC since the fork is a lot less than Bitcoin.  
What a minimalistic representation of the eco-system you provide, neglecting standard difficulty adjustment every 2016 blocks, assuming there will indefinitely be 2 miners on the BCC chain and ignoring incentives of others miners to participate in the network. I'm going to go right ahead handwave you away. ��
@_date: 2017-08-02 08:43:26
A very delusive argument totally unrelated to the context that further solidifies that argument of biases.
@_date: 2017-08-21 21:27:05


Messing with what 'rules'? Rules that you imagined? The legacy Bitcoin network does not precisely create 12.5BTC every 10 minutes, it aims to average that value. The supply of Bitcoin Cash is much less than that of legacy Bitcoin at the moment, and therefore an average supply of much less than 12.5BCC every 10 minutes since the fork. Do you truly not realise EDA is a mechanism to 'catch-up' when the supply is **literally running behind** that of legacy Bitcoin, this is far from excess inflation, and definitely not an exploit, and is certainly not abusable without serious coordinated miner effort.  
Have you even considered standard difficulty adjustments? Your fantastic semantics in this title are entirely false and you should own up to your fake and literal bullshit claims that block reward has been affected, when it is functioning as expected as the specification declares.  
How about you pull out some mathematics as to why you believe this instead of making claims with no basis.

You're being entirely immature, its not by becoming a credible member of the bitcoin community that Gandalf will grant you the right post on this reddit. 
If you truly believe OP is attention seeking, then I invite you to stop posting here.
Regardless of ignorance, status or reward. People should have the right to ask for help without being labelled as an idiot or wealthy and somehow concluding it inst worth your time. Of-course OP knows it was entirely his fault and it needs to be undone.
Fact: Higher rewards = greater professional assistance.
OP, I feel your pain. I wish I could help but I'm sure someone can assist you.

Sure, adding to the pot of the block reward to be mined by an uncertain lucky pool is a form of donation. Most people like to donate to a specific organization. All it is, is being generous to the miners which most people do unintentionally. 
The real reason to change your transaction fee is to prioritize a transaction.
@_date: 2015-09-04 20:07:06
Absolutely yes. There is no reason to be able to output such a high transaction fee.

Hey I am too! ;)

Hi Bitfury,
Here is the transaction.
Thanks for your time.

That's just an interesting way to put something less pessimistically lol

And upvote for you.
@_date: 2015-09-11 08:59:50
Will be processing this now. You are absolutely correct, that it is my mistake and you have just as much right to walk away since I did hand my bitcoins over as a transaction fee. Once again my mistake, but I would highly appreciate the money back.
Absolutely my mistake:&gt; The confirmation transaction will be done and replied here today.

Simply negligent, I have used blockchain.info custom send many many times and I just wanted a quick transaction. Just somehow got the two mixed up and didnt double check.
Interesting to know that the blockchain.info transaction fee limit is 1 BTC, I just missed it!

Thank you so ever much BitFury_Group, I am very very appreciative!
I have sent back a little tip in donation towards BitFury for your efforts.
Here is a thank you thread:
All bitcoin transactions are being double checked ;) from now on.
Take care, I wish you the best.
Kind regards.

I don't think that using Coinbase is using bitcoin as it was intended, despite the features that Coinbase add to bitcoins functionality by means of their platform.
