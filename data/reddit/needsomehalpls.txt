Its funny how these threads appear now, the day before tomorrow. Greeks had years and years to buy Bitcoin, its not like we havent bailed them out 3 times already. I'd say if your greek ur fucked should have bought months ago.

All this repeating... Everyone here knows about nyse and nasdaq. It has not increased btc demand one bit.
Next thing you repeaters like to say is blocksize blocksize. 
Think about this: The people that need to start buying and using bitcoin for it to become "mainstream" don't even know there is something like a blocksize, or a block at all for that matter.

In times of full blocks
@_date: 2017-01-25 15:20:06
Id rather ask for pools to implement a bigger blocks implementation. SegWit is not going to activate, lets be honest. On top of that a developement monopoly is bad, and with an implementation like unlimited we give the choice of blocksize to the people.
@_date: 2016-11-16 11:35:09
You chose to misinterpet my comment, probably intentionaly.
You'd have to be retarded to think free there indicates cost, its free as in free from the burden of special interests and lobby in the form of funding a big part of the development  to gain a say in the developement and future of bitcoin. But ofcourse its easier to stroke your epeen and score circlejerk points here in by throwing it on tx fee's and taking shit too literal when it suits you.
@_date: 2016-11-16 10:31:28
My bank account charges me zit for a transaction, you don't have to explain why or how you can still live with a unneeded arbitrary limit on bitcoin. The point is we dont need it and we dont have to live with 9 cent transaction fees. Who honestly gives a shit what you think is acceptable, bitcoin should be free to grow to its full potential onscale

@_date: 2016-11-22 10:40:52
Still buying, price does not really matter. More the outlook of bitcoin. For example ill stop buying when segwit activates and we wont get bigger blocks. I will buy more if I see that consesus is going the right way to bigger blocks, bigger demand and bigger prices
@_date: 2016-12-27 13:59:40
It does not work like that. The limits you will meet are not I cannot do X calculations per Y and now I can try every private key.
Its more like there is X energy in the Universe, 100% energy and time efficient calculation would take more than X energy to try every key. 
Quantum computing will not per definition break Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-12-27 13:52:52
If only TX fee for 1 TX was cheaper than day of living. Cant use it on a daily base unless we get bigger blocks and with it less tx fee per tx. Why use Bitcoin if sending it to my mom cost as much as 5 KG rice. Shits useless

Idk what he is implying but hes right, same with IT, men are light years ahead of women,but because of diversity en and equal rights BS women get hired where men would excell (equality lols). So now you can reply to me like someone stepped on your toes. The other guy wasnt clear enough, yes women suck at finance, IT, automotive technolgies etc etc (dont even try to reply with some grace hopper-esk dike's wikipedia page about some ancient rare women that did something technological, these are called exceptions which exist  for all rules)

I havent even totalled 1000 dolllars spend on Bitcoin, then in 2013 i started looking for jobs I had all my bitcoin stuff on my papers. Been working almost 2 years in a fintech company making way more than Ive ever put in btc. So come to think of it, it was quite enriching for my life, not that I became an overnight bitcoin millionaire but I did have enough knowledge to find common ground with a guy to give me a well payed job without me having any prior fintech experience but some playing around with btc

1. People that dont care about bitcoin are most likely not here.
2. People that dont care about bitcoin will not feel very inclined to read a book about bitcoin. Because they dont care about the subject. Like would you read a book about your mother in law ?

Before any of this happens we need to leave the "desperately try to come up with some way we can use bitcoin without using bitcoin" because we dont ever want to give away control and power. And for this the bitcoin community and everyone else needs to accept the fact that banks will never admit to a better technology and give away their power. They are in power because they did everything they could to get there, its no coinsidence.
For the banks, the money, the system, all of it is the means to the goal that is Power. And defently NOT the othet way around.
Once you can accept this you will know that we will NEVER naturally and gradually evolve into (something like) bitcoin because the people in control want to stay in control. And again they are not in control because they control the money, they control the money to be in total control. A small but very important perseption shift.

Because you are a statist faggot that needs someone else to tell you what to like, what to dislike, what you can do and what you cannot do. Because you lack the mental capacity to seperate right from wrong for yourself. 
The reason why the intelligent and civilised humans have to live in this fucking kindergarten matrix society is fools like you and it pisses me off.

That reddit is full of frustrated nerds that feel like they have something to prove. But yeah I learned mainly about different mining protocols like stratum build by slush and the original getwork. I learned about different wallets and how they work. Ive made several verified accounts at exchanges  and other very usefull stuff

People are not going to switch from credit card slave to bitcoin rebel overnight. When do bitcoiners start to understand that 'other people' will never ever ever start using bitcoin for the reasons we do.

They always make it sound like: the currency will never be worth anything but the there is allot of vc money pouring inti btc.
How can bitcoin evolve but the price stay low ? More use = More demand, no expansion of supply = higher price per unit ? Where am I going wrong here, where is all that fantastic evolution or where is my understandig of supply and demans wrong ? 
@_date: 2015-02-25 15:46:18
Well downvote me all you want, its proven that more options lead to a higher bounce rate.
Adding a payment option that is not used could in fact cost the company money. The only motivator you have to say it doesnt cost them anything is because you want it to stay there to help bitcoin adoption, the merchant does not give a damn about btc adoption and just wants to have a high as possible conversion.
It will never happen because `it makes he world a better a place', it will only happen when alot of people need something, they need it yesterday and bitcoin being the only option to pay for it.
