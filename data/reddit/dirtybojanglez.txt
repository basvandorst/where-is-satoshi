If Net Neutrality passes, they'll count every bitcoin and charge anyone transmitting them.

If you get nervous about one coin, switch to another. There's always some coin on the cusp of rising. But you are dumb tho lol.

It's what happens to any industry that has futures launched. The price dips then goes above the previous ATH. Sometimes this process takes years.

I think people sold because of the rate bitcoin's price rose. If it increases slowly, I think fewer people will sell. I am not an expert tho.

He says the value in bitcoin is in the network that allows the exchange of value. Was bitcoin made to be a store of value or a currency? Right now it seems to act as a store of value which means it would not be that valuable since it doesn't use the network as it was originally intended. What value does bitcoin have if transaction fees are extremely high and confirmations take a long time? Surely there are other cryptos with better utility, right?

just smashed it for a second

So is bitcoin being pumped because of brand recognition? It doesn't seem to work as intended since people are flooding in. Which cryptocurrencies work well under loads equal or similar to what bitcoin is currently under?
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:45:01
That's me

I'm new to crypto so I'm finding out about other cryptos that operate better than bitcoin as a currency. Is it possible for bitcoin to be a type of "gold" and bitcoin cash to be the currency? We do it in America with gold and the dollar. Bitcoin seems to be the prototype for a lot of different cryptos and seems like a reference point for all of them. I don't know though. I'm trying to figure it all out. What do you recommend?

Haven't fucked with btc since April but the dispensary I frequent in Colorado accepts btc now and there are a few ATMs out here in Denver.

It's risky because exchanges might go down. Just hodl.
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:16:57
Futures are gonna tank bitcoin for at least 2 years. You done fucked up.
