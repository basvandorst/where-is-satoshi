Yes, people are sure to hold a lot more than before, they slowly realize there's no point in panic selling... except not, they will always panic sell, unfortunately.

Seriously, screw the coins right now... you are in a serious situation, let them do whatever they want and avoid giving any financial advice to anyone. Maybe post in on financial advice sub or something. I can't give you any advice on how to proceed.

If this is a true story it goes to show that you don't mix friends/family and money. It was both parties' fault and they if they were that stupid and careless to give you that money well, that makes them pretty stupid and careless. You too, though, you never should have placed yourself in that situation. I would, if I were you, negotiate a better agreement with them and pay back in small monthly payments.
