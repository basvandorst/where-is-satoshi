Greed is good in a trustless network.

The debate is over the size of blocks, not the size of the blockchain.  
I know very little about it, but from what I gather, the core devs don't want to increase the size because they fear it will lead to further centralization of bitcoin.  I'm not sure if that refers to miners or nodes.
I think the argument for increasing block size is that as more transactions are coming through the network, they will take longer to confirm because only so many transactions can fit in each block.
Experts, please correct me where I'm wrong.

I know I'm quite late here, but I've been using the fold app for about a month now and I have some feedback for you:
First of all, I love it.  I almost never went to Starbucks before, but now thanks to Fold, they've got the cheapest latte in town.
However, if you guys really want to raise awareness about bitcoin, you should make it more obvious on the barcode screen.  Right now, it says "Spend bitcoin at Startbucks™ &amp; save 20%".  But it's too small.  It should be way more prominent, like a huge bitcoin logo or something.  When the employee scans my phone, they often say something like, "What is this, a gift card or a coupon?".  I'd rather hear, "What's bitcoin?".  And maybe you could add a QR code at the bottom of the page linking to the answer.
Also, when you load more bitcoin, you get a new gift card added to your account.  Any remaining balance you had is still on your previous card which is still accessible from the app.  (swipe left and right)  This wasn't immediately obvious to me.  Perhaps adding a note about it on the reload screen could help reduce customer service emails.
Finally, I love the fact that you can use the service without being logged in, but it would be nice if users can log in with email instead of using social media accounts.  Perhaps emails containing account or balance info could be signed and encrypted as well.

Mine survived and still worked afterwards.

You can cut the chip out of the card with a razor, or you can put your card in the microwave for 10 seconds to fry the circuit.
