0 takes up to 10 minutes, 1 takes another 10 minutes after that. [but that's not always enough]( and who is going to wait 20 minutes for their payment to go through after finishing a meal?

Counterpoint: yesterday I checked my credit card statement and noticed $360 worth of charges to the iTunes store, even though I don't have an apple account. I called my credit card company, and they said it would be refunded and I'd get a new card sent in the mail. If that had been crypto \(like someone stealing my private key\) then it woulda been tough titties.

most human beings are neither communists nor full fledged libertarians. it's possible to believe in a decentralised currency and also not want to see your children shot at school, the two are unrelated. the only ones who benefit when we try to split politics into two extremes are political interest/lobby groups and probably most commercial news media.

You know gold itself doesn't actually allow confiscation either... It's not like the Au atoms have the law of the US baked into them any more than anything else. I'm sure if BTC becomes part of the economy they'll find a way to just arrest you if you don't hand over your coin, same as they would with regular money (or gold in the case of the link).
You could hide your gold under your mattress, and you can hide your private keys, but if they can prove (to their standard of proof) that you have crypto, and have the motivation to extract it from you, then there's nothing in the the blockchain itself that stops you from going to jail.

If nobody is accepting btc as currency then it's just a way of moving between fiats. and if that's the case, then banks 100&amp; still control your ability to use it. they have blocked transactions with exchanges before.

I'm all for Bitcoin, but the other day scammers somehow spent about $600 with my credit card, and when I called the bank they refunded the money. So banks aren't all bad.

It's kinda embarrassing to admit on this sub, but I've never actually seen a Bitcoin before.
@_date: 2018-02-15 01:20:46
If people were using BTC to pay for things, what would banning it actually do? You could tell shopkeepers not to accept crypto, but how would they enforce this? You can arrest everyone you catch exchanging crypto, but if (as happened in India) all your Fiat savings are suddenly worthless, and you need to put food on the table, it's probably a risk people would take. And I'm sure the right shopkeeper would accept the risk for a little premium.
I agree that there are not yet sufficient structures in place to support crypto payments being mainstream in developing nations though, it's why I made the post to begin with. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 11:20:34
is it just me or are reddit's explanations of bitcoin movements akin to fortune telling or some kind of astrology.

Not true, the use of cash is controlled by the government. [In late 2016]( the Indian government announced that smaller notes would no longer be valid currency, without any notice. There was only a window of a few weeks where you could exchange it for other notes, and a limit on how much (4500, then later 2000 rupees) you could exchange.
The problem was that a lot of India's less wealthy population are unbanked, and kept all their money in the form of small cash, more or less under their mattresses. There were obviously massive runs on the bank and ATMs, but the poor were most badly hit by it due to their high dependence on cash.
It's a pretty good lesson in why Fiat isn't as secure as a lot of people think.

half the people trading in december were buying - that's how a market works. and there's no guarantee bitcoin will ever return to december prices. anyone who tells you there is is either a liar or a fool.

if this is just some junky finance terminology that i'm not familiar with, then i retract what i said. 
but otherwise, if a limit to something isn't known, that doesn't mean its unlimited. there is a limit to how much i can drink without dying. i don't know that limit. but that doesn't mean i can drink an unlimited amount of beer without dying.
unlimited means there is no limit, which would imply that the price of bitcoin could potentially rise to infinity, which is stupid beyond measure. 
so stupid that i'd say it's unlimited.

why is any of this inherently good? i'm all for blockchain, but binance is just a private company here to make money. 
you could easily look at this another way and say look how much of peoples money binance is dealing with, yet they have no branches and only 300 employees, and are making a killing with their (possibly) shady practices.
you may think that bitcoin is the future. but a dodgy guy on the street selling bitcoin is still a con artist.

A lot of people have *heard* of Bitcoin, but almost none of them know what it is. Firstly because its not very intuitive, even to technically minded/skilled people. Secondly because there is so much bad or mis- information out there. I'm a Solidity (Ethereum) developer, and whenever people ask me to explain what I do, even the ones who have heard of Bitcoin, generally I need to explain Blockchain and Bitcoin first. Most people just know Bitcoin as "that new internet money?".
@_date: 2018-04-09 03:44:31
are these traceable? do you just give it cash and a wallet address or does it link to your bank card/phone number etc? also is there a camera mounted in it like with a real atm?

If USD has hyperinflated and crashes, then it will have long ago stopped being a relevant measure of the value of something. This is a pointlessly narrow minded argument. Even if crypto circle jerkers get their dream, and *every fiat currency* has somehow crashed, and we are all now using bitcoin for every transaction, it's still going to have a fixed value relative to things you want to buy. Even if you could buy a coke with 1 satoshi that's a finite value. Even if you could pay for the entirety of all mankids achievements with a single satoshi that's a finite value. Even if the value of bitcoin doubles every second forever, that's a finite value too, because the universe will reach heat death in a few billion years. 
The universe is finite, and the small world of crypto investing, even throughout its entire history and future is *much* more finite than that. 
saying that the value of bitcoins is unlimited is the sort of willfully ignorant nonsense that makes people buy bitconnect and verge tokens. 
here's the only accurate price prediction you will ever read in this sub: the value of bitcoin will not asymptote vertically.
