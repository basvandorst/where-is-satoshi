Oh yeah. I too am still feeling the pain from the post-2017 valuation.
EDIT: I also wouldn't say the whole market is ponzi. There just isn't regulation to prevent things like Bitconnect and other ponzi schemes.

It does look cool, I was making a joke. The classic "borrowing bitcoin joke" 
A kid asks his dad for $10 in bitcoin. He says, "what do you need $12 for? Get a job and make your own $8."

Why would you need 11 monitors? It's not like 6 monitors will help with trading. But you do you, enjoy your 8 monitors.

I feel ya. It can be overwhelming for sure, especially given the current market. I personally go back and forth between consolidating and diversifying. When the core coins (BTC, ETH, LTC, NEO, and BCH (in my opinion)) go up, I diversify into other alts and project coins. When the core prices start to drop, I consolidate. Some core coins do better than others and there are a lot of factors involved in that.

Diversify to get rich, consolidate to stay rich.
