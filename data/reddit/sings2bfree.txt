They never seem to be in gridlock when it comes to their donor's interests....hmm....

Where were they when it soared to 16k?  NBC is bought and paid for.

Im sorry we disagree. Thanks for reaching out.

Because single payer, $15/hr minumum wage.  The right to clean water.  The right to work 40hrs/wk and not be in poverty.  The rights of the Native Americans.  The right to have an education.  The right to have representatives that actually work for the working class.  The right to love who you choose.  The rights of Mother Earth.  Being against wall street fraud, pharma fraud, oil fraud, and war profiteering.  Being against selling B12 bombers to the Saudis for 3.2 billion dollars.  These things will always matter regardless of me...

I watched him talk myself.  I know people personally who have business with him. He lies with such a vigor, you second guess yourself.  I believe he is psychologically unstable.  It is not one or the other.  As long as everyone gets paid, right?

You know this is virtual world and I can be home right now, right?

In solidarity, brother.  Good luck to you.  I hope you and your loved ones stay well.

You try winning poker with a pair of pocket kings only to find out they made a pair of 3's the top hand.  Go take a look at the DNC fraud lawsuit where they stated anyone who gave money knew that it was rigged and therefore are complicit.

Your right.  Fall in line or else. /s  Very Dark side...  How do you not see that only a Sith deals in absolutes?  You're with us or you're against us.  Remind you of anyone?
@_date: 2017-05-12 21:25:50
Ouch man...the insults.  I guess I'll just take my ball and go home then. /s.  
@_date: 2017-05-12 21:17:48
and what are yours for backing a corrupt party and the worst candidate in US history?
@_date: 2017-05-12 21:20:31
Tell that to the Haitians.  Tell that to the Wal-mart employees on food stamps.  Tell that to the "no fly zone" that is "gonna kill a lot of Syrians, so there's that"  Tell that to David Brock, CTR and the brigade of bots.  Where's your excuse for not beating Trump?  Who's fault was that?
@_date: 2017-05-12 21:08:04
We will never forget the DNC's fraudulent election no matter how many Russia boogeymen you throw at us.
@_date: 2017-05-12 21:07:07
And you are...shittiest candidate in history or bust eh?  How'd that work out for you?  Still can't admit you were wrong, huh?

Right, anyone against Clinton and her Dem cronies must work for Putin. /s  Considering she pocketed a lot of money in a 3 way deal that just happened to send control of 20% of US Uranium to Putin, I'd put this bullshit to bed.
@_date: 2017-05-12 21:29:32
Still waiting on a constructive reason for why you think Clinton was a good idea...
@_date: 2017-05-13 00:05:22
I'd like to know more..
@_date: 2017-05-12 21:26:32
This is a term called gaslighting.  Look it up.
@_date: 2017-05-12 21:03:59
What if I told you you can hate Trump and still be critical of corruption of other people....
P.s.  I'm a Berner.  Why do you expect your representatives to take money from special interests who only care about exploitation for profit and then wonder why you're being exploited?

I honestly can't remember the last time they were right...

If he had shown one iota of actually doing any of this instead of what he has done (which is the exact opposite), I'd consider it.  But he's a scam artist.  That's what he does.  Makes false deals and leaves his business partners in shambles.  However, 2016 very much taught me about the dangers of consolidation of power in government. I understand the concept a lot better now.
