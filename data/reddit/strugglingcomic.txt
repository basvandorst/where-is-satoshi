I think you severely underestimate the holiday "bump." Many retailers make the majority of their annual revenue between November-December.

I just remember being hella impressed when I was looking at colleges circa 2005. Perhaps it's become more common now, with this whole "internet of things."

This is a school where you can check the status of your nearest laundry machines online, to see if they're full or not or how long your wash cycle has left. I'm sure they'll figure something cool out very quickly, AND have a smart/techy userbase to experiment with.
Sure, laundry machines that accept Bitcoin (one obvious hypothetical) might not seem like a big deal, but that's exactly the type of mundane day-to-day transaction that Bitcoin currently has no ecosystem for.

I see you must be quite new to Bitcoin, if today's prices seem low to you. Or you have an exceedingly long term time horizon (&gt; 10-15 years).

Seriously!  I have no idea what their management is like, but generally speaking older companies struggle with being agile and adaptive in changing marketplaces.  With just a little imagination and foresight, this could make them as big as traditional banking giants within the next 5-10 years.  They'll make some money straight-up from normal collection of fees in fiat, but the real money will be in running the exchange, being paid in BTC, and sitting on that pile while it appreciates (see the guy that ran Silk Road and his 140k coins that were seized - now worth ~$100 million, and that was one dude running an illegal marketplace).

Perhaps your information is a bit outdated?  Here's an article from July 2013 describing how high savings are blocking growth: 
It's true that high savings rates are a relatively recent phenomenon (up fom ~23% of disposable income to ~30%+ in the last decade, from same article).  Anecdotally, my parents who were middle class white collar workers back in the late 80s/early 1990s in China made about $10-$20 USD/month.  What would have been the point of saving money back then?  In 10 years, even with rising salaries, they might have saved what, a couple thousand dollars, at most?  Scrimping for 10 years just so you can buy a couple of iPhones would have been disastrously inefficient.
As the article mentions, people nowadays in middle class jobs are saving a huge amount of their much higher salaries because now they have to worry about buying their own apartments/houses, their own cars, paying for tuition (college used to be almost entirely free), etc.  And more working class folks save because they have to; no matter what they do, there's generally little upward mobility for these folks, and even though they make more money working in large cities than staying in the countryside, it makes even more sense to send large portions of their salary back home to relatives anyways.  Also, 20+ years ago, there was almost nothing for individual consumers to buy anyways.
You're right that the government doesn't want these savings leaving the country, but it's not because they've spent decades encouraging savings.  It's simply a way of maintaining their chokehold on the economy, and fighting the decentralizing powers of Bitcoin.

Because if enough people wanted to watch this, someone somewhere would start to kidnap poor people in poor countries and force them to do it (i.e. just like today's real world human sex trafficking).

I believe all transactions over 10k are reported to the IRS, and trying to structure transactions to avoid the 10k line is even more suspicious. That being said, nothing really happens to you or your money, but if you get audited there's more of an established paper trail.

Damnit Windows!  But seriously, that blows.  I'm afraid to ask about backups and whatnot...

Fwiw, most places that accept Bitcoin as payment now, have dynamically set prices in BTC, relative to a (mostly) fixed price in USD or some other established currency.
So, if say Steam wanted to accept BTC, they'd just have to allow for variable BTC pricing.  A new game like Bioshock Infinite might debut at $60 USD and 0.3 BTC, and if the price of Bitcoin doubles overnight, then the next day's price should still be $60 USD but 0.15BTC.

You can't complain about the dangers of a deflationary currency, and in the same breath make assumptions about how the suppliers in your supply-chain aren't going to accept Bitcoin as payment for goods/services. Why the fracking frack wouldn't they? Deflationary currency, remember? Everyone should be thrilled to accept them, if offered the chance.

Hey, at least you're helping to spread awareness and adoption (I assume)! In 20 years when we're billionaires, we'll look back and laugh about giving away $200 million USD cuz someone posted a funny cat video or whatever.

Ooof. Hopefully it's just another one of those silly things that couples rack up in shared experiences over the years ("honey, remember that time you forgot the groceries in the parking lot and drove off?").
Does she know anything about bitcoins? Maybe it's time for a little chat about cryptocurrencies?

On the bright side, good on you for fixing a financial problem and keeping up with college.  Keep it up!
