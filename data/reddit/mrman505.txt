If you transfer money directly from your bank account to a gambling site, your bank will freeze your account. Happened to me. Since his bitcoins are still on CB, they are acting as his bank. Not their fault.

I think this will be my first ever bitcoin purchase. I haven't had a fly trap since I was little.

To be honest, I don't know how any currency works, and I own USD, CAD, BTC, LTC, and DOGE.

Don't use eBay. I tired to buy it a while ago 3 times from there, twice the seller never sent it. Luckily eBay refunded me after I opened a case against seller.

I am doing this too, and am trying to think of what to include on the paper explaining what Bitcoin is to someone who has never heard of it, or just briefly heard it in the news a year ago.
