Wow! What an amazingly generous thing to do. Good on ya.
I've donated several times to Charity:Water. It's a great organization and 100% of your donation goes towards bringing clean water to people in need.

You're welcome I guess.
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:14:51
Thank you. That's the hope! It's not a feeling I would want anyone else to feel.

Just like many other naive Bitcoin holders, I visited the BTG website after the fork curious how much BTG I would receive. On their site they linked to the mybtgwallet website which asked for your recovery seed. Before typing it in I thought that it probably wasn't a good idea, but it *was* linked from the official BTG site and the BTG developers even [tweeted]( saying that the mybtgwallet website was safe so I felt that it was secure – which was part of the scam.
I typed in my seed, hit enter, and immeditaly felt like I made a mistake. I considered moving my funds and wiping my wallet, but I figured I was being paranoid – I wasn't. Not too long after, I loaded up my offline wallet and there was just a big goose egg where my all of BTC and ETH were. At first I thought it was just a bug with my device, but then I checked the transaction log and I knew exactly what happened. All in all, they stole [1.8 BTC]( and [31 ETH]( from me. I wish I could say that I got into crypto really early and that amount was nothing to me, but that's not the case. That was A LOT of money to me and I feel sick everytime I look at the Bitcoin price since I missed out on some very large gains. I even feel nervous checking my balance on my new wallet even though I've been very protective of my new seed.
I feel embarrassed and stupid just writing this, but hopefully I can be a cautionary tale for all the new Bitcoin holders that are joining this community.
What I learned:
* Never share your private seed. If for some reason you have to, move all your funds first, and never use that wallet again.
* Trust no one. Why did it matter if the BTG site linked to mybtgwallet? For some reason I thought BTG was trustworthy, but looking back, there's no reason why I should have assumed that. Just because their site ends in .org? Stupid me.
Here's a good write up on the scam if you want to know more:

Thank you

Yeah, I don't know what I was thinking. I'd heard horror stories in the past – we all have — of people losing their money. I guess I always thought, "that'd never happen to me."
I learned a very, very, very expensive lesson.

I lost ALL of my Bitcoin to the BTG phishing scam. Is that the same thing? :-(
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:50:23
Thanks man. I appreciate it. Yeah, the offline storage I was using could store multiple coins on it. Once they had access to the seed, they had access to all the different coins I had.

It's hard to take ZeroHedge seriously when their articles are written by fictional characters.

I forget, how many developers created Bitcoin again?

I can spend cash instantly without having to wait for a confirmation. How is Bitcoin better (or how will be) than cash?
