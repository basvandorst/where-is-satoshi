It’s about time. I had to quit using Kraken because I could never get on the site without an error.

I just posted this but you beat me to it. This quote could have been the whole article.

Thank you for the explanation

I think you're not taking into account the impact NK's nuclear capabilities will have in the region that surrounds it. 
These events will surely destabilize Eastern Asia to an extent, which I'm sure will have at least somewhat of a positive effect on cryptos because Asian currencies are not as strong as the dollar and are more volatile in nature.

"If a group of CEOs can simply get together and unilaterally change bitcoin, then that means a government could – and hence bitcoin is dead."
Great quote to end the article.

Exactly. If we reach that point, money (fiat or crypto) will be the least of our concerns. Strict survival will be the name of the game.

All of my friends: “you don’t have to buy a whole bitcoin?”

Nobody told him to HODL

Although I disagree that these groups will "tame" Bitcoin, I appreciate how Melamed said that he's changed his mind on cryptocurrency which is a rare sentiment from these types.

I agree, I just found it interesting that Buffett decided to chime in.

It's called arbitrage, and it's a common technique to take advantage of lags in the marketplace. Some markets aren't as liquid which means the price takes longer to approach the equilibrium.

Hey! I was also an Econ major in Undergrad and I did a research project on Bitcoin for International Finance back in 2014.
Our work was similar to yours in that it analyzed Bitcoin and the benefits it provides. What you could do to show that Bitcoin can stand on its own is to look into how it's used for remittances. We discovered that countries in the Middle East, like Iran, have used it in place of their own currency when their currency was weak.
We also described some of the negative implications, such as making money laundering a bit easier and that it can facilitate the growth of underground networks. 
One of the best research projects I've ever done -- really sparked my interest in Bitcoin.

I was not expecting your comment to end that way, but I think you may be on the right track. It's still early and a lot of people view BTC as a speculative investment, so I think that lends credence to the idea that there will be some sort of selloff related to Aug 1.
However, I think some of the effects of the Aug 1 event have already been baked into the market and will mitigate some of the effects.
I believe it's only going to be a short term phenomenon as BTC and other cryptos have so much potential and the people that are HODLING will be the ones to carry BTC into the future.

I'm very anxious to see the outcome and I can't even say what I'll do with my own. But for now I'm just enjoying the present!
