I will be watching ghash.io closely for further evidence of selfish mining. This is troubling to me.

Looks like a fishing email from Gox h4x0rs

is this true? proof?
@_date: 2014-08-06 04:52:09
How many technology schools are there in georgia? Not many. How many papers have there been on "FPGA based bitcoin miners"? Not many. 
This is horse shit unless you post real proof of who you are, but that burden of proof is on you.

Are you investing in bitcoin to save up for your next lego set?

hahaha best comment in the thread

My 2 cents: did a bitinstant transaction for $480 earlier today to my Mt Gox account, got the email saying my mt gox account was credited while starting my car outside of the store. Will use again.

You are relying on too limited a time period to make these predictions - I doubt it will ever get below its 50.1 recent low. Its hard to say when it will start climbing, but yesterday someone put in a buy wall at $70 worth around $800,000 - makes me feel like we are going to be above that value for the forecastable future.

You cant replace Spotify with Pandora, just as someone cannot replace their television with a kaleidoscope.

I have to agree with you - I dont think that this is the start of a fedral war on bitcoins. 
But its very hard to say with real certainty that that is the case. Its all just a guessing game at this point. 
@_date: 2013-04-25 04:47:12
THIS IS SO CLEVER.
Ingore all the script kiddie talk, no one is going to find this guy via the email(he obviously took the very simple precautions for this). The only people who can find it are either a) within his group of associates, or b) at Liberty.
Why is this clever? Because its reversing the power of bitcoin: someone who knows him can turn him in and anonymously collect the money, OR someone at Liberty can use their proprietary information (if it exists at all) to track it down and make a quick 5k on the side one day at work. 
Either case: if anyone at all other than the hacker knows about this, or recognizes the image linked, then the attacker has a new angle of risk to worry about. 
@_date: 2013-04-15 18:50:34
Short answer: Yeah, Bitinstant is a quick, easy, and still fairly reliable way to bitcoins.
I actually did another transfer for a friend on Tuesday of last week - it didnt go quite as fast, and he said it posted to his account 8 hours after he made it. Still far and away faster than any other funding option.
As for cash/debit, I would think that would depend on the moneygram processor. You could try calling ahead and asking the business where you plan on sending the moneygram. If I had to guess, I would think most places would accept debit, but I havent done it.
Enjoy your cryptocurrency!

I just read through this whole thread and yeah, this is the best comment. Well played, sir.

After 90 days, if no other claim has been received for the same url, your Instawallet balance under 50 BTC will be refunded. If several claims have been filed for the same url, we will process those claims on a case by case basis, under the presumption that the claim we received first belongs to the legitimate balance holder.
**Claims for wallets that hold a balance greater than 50 BTC will be processed on a case by case and best efforts basis.**
That is not the sort of thing you say if you plan on giving it all back, honestly. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 00:35:19
I deserve that. But hey, it worked fine for me all afternoon though!

Current lag is at 30 minutes. I really appriciated the AMA by Mt Gox the other day... but that only goes so far. They are making an insane amount of money every day from just having their website up. They need to scale that shit up ASAP - and as a software developer, I understand that its not as easy as people wish it was. 
But shit man, its not that big of a price drop, and 30 minutes lag is crazy. 
Though ultimately: bitcoin is not an ideal platform for day trading. The price moments are so erratic, and the lag is such an issue, that its really hard for me to justify much trading activity. I might make some limit orders from time to time, but generally I am playing the long game. Lag doesnt really effect that very much.

An opensource currency getting opensource hosting implimentation? It makes me a lil teary eyed.
@_date: 2013-04-16 07:39:54
This is generally true - just out of the nature of type of person that wants to spend time talking online about cryptocurrencies. I dont see many people saying false information in support of their ideas, though they certainly can be biased towards optimism. 
@_date: 2013-04-25 19:12:58
hkckoo I do not disagree with you - though I think there is a small but non-negligible chance that a idle worker at Liberty could try to do a follow-the-money sort of op, and deposit some funds and try to see where they go. 
@_date: 2013-04-04 02:45:19
Listen, thats the best case scenario. No one is going to be able to sue them for the value of the BC, who knows who runs instawallet. Even if you found out, served them within the legal boundries of whereever in the world they might be, they could easily say that their bitcoins were all stolen and that they have no assets. 
Now I hope that everyone gets there coins back, absolutely - but there is just no reason to expect that. Why else would they say they will be able to help over 50bc accounts on a "case by case" basis? If you still have all the money, you tell people they will get it all back. 
And with bitcoins, generally there is no halfway hacks - either the hacker will have compromised Instawallets security and been able to take all the coins, instantly, or they will have gotten close but not gotten any of the money at all. Low probability of a middle ground.

PayPal has nothing to do with mining. They are a payment transfer service. Its not anything at all similar to their current business model.

Any associating the attack today in Boston with the bitcoin price movement is simply your imagination and coincidental timing. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 18:36:55
^ this. Its awesome news (and expect it to be part of the reason for the giant rush past $150), but until its included in their quarterly financial papers, its too early to start celebrating. 
@_date: 2013-04-04 01:46:45
Why bother shorting them if you can just seize them and say it was hacked? Not saying its true, not saying its false, just saying, this is the wild west and who the fuck knows whats going on at Instawallet.
@_date: 2013-04-16 07:47:52
...thats exactly what a real bull would say
@_date: 2013-04-17 06:13:35
This is exactly the answer I was looking for when I made this post - and I agree with your conclusions.
@_date: 2013-04-17 20:30:25
This does not seem genuine. They would make a post on their website for this sort of thing, no reason to distribute to just a few people at a time. 
I trade on BitFloor, and I am continuing to do so, and I have not had any problems. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 22:08:12
This was my reaction as well. Agree that yahoo news is entirely a joke, pretty much like the rest of yahoo.

double upvote this. "Every time the price rises, its the market realizing the power of bitcoins. Every time the price falls, its a DDoS by HFTs and Anonymous!"

I use Bitcoin Ticker as well, its price alarts functionality is great.
