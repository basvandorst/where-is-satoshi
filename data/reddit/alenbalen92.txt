What a garbage website. Please ignore it. 0 quality.

Uhm... Responsible for that? I am pretty sure the low quality code/devs is behind it since they won't do anything about it.

My thought about these posts is that... Why don't you take your time to read the FAQ and information on the right as well as Googling yourself? Obviously your internet works just fine?
@_date: 2017-08-15 07:26:43
Lol these posts are so worthless. Mind sharing WHY you think like that or was the most important thing to mention you work with "very wealthy individuals"? So lame.

Oh gosh. Cant you guys shut up with these pathetic posts? Let people cash out any time they want, how much they want. Maybe they have a life to pay. If You wanna "hodl", do it. If others dont, let them... Its their loss if it goes to the moon not yours. So why even bother crying? Fucking baby..

Thanks for taking your time to write such solid reply. Appreciate it!

Hahahaha. I love that these lunatics are so mad they missed out on buying in very early. Ok you don't like bitcoin. Get over it. Move on you fucking loser lmao. Who cares if you don't believe in it? Why is it so important to you then? Sigh.

Can someone please tell me how they exchange quickly to fiat with BTCPay? Thats the only benefit I see with the others. Much smoother than sending to an exchange, exchanging and request a bank withdrawal.

If a p2p payment system cant handle micro transactions its just lame to blame it on "United Bitcoin" for clogging the network, rather than the code, which is the real cause here. Dont you agree?
