Essentially zero - I developed my own payment processor so there were no [centralized] payment processors, in the spirit of Bitcoin's decentralization - again, I was a mod here for two years so it's not like I accepted Bitcoin just for shits and giggles, I was an active member of this community and an ideological supporter of the technology.
The cost was due in part to the paradox of choice - if I offer too many payment options people will take the easy route and just not chose any, whereas if I only have one or two payment options they are much more likely to complete a purchase. Additionally, the negative social stigma attached to Bitcoin certainly didn't help - I had numerous customers complain that I was associating with "drug dealers and pedophiles".
Whether that's the actual demographics of Bitcoin or not doesn't matter, it's the public opinion (ie my customers) that matters. And when I ran an A/B test, I found there was a 5.8% reduction in revenue when I offered Bitcoin payments. 


I'd rather not receive more death threats (nor have my employees harassed for my statements - just *yesterday* one of my CSRs was yelled at because we no longer "support Bitcoin") - especially for "old news", but a cursory google search should produce some results.

I didn't stop accepting bitcoin due to low sales - the ample amounts of data I published over the years showed I had low [Bitcoin] sales for *well* over a year before I dropped bitcoin, yet I stuck with it since I believed in the technology and was an active mod here who thought bitcoin could revolutionize the payment industry. 
I ultimately dropped bitcoin payments because 1) it cost me more money to accept than the amount I made by accepting it (a 5.8% loss in revenue, to be exact) and 2) everytime I brought up [very legitimate] issues with the bitcoin protocol or community in general I was immediately written off as a paid shill/professional troll, just because I didn't parrot the hivemind  popular opinion.
When I started getting death threats and my employees started getting harassed for me simply posting statistics, that was the straw that broke the camel's back for me. 
I'm a tech geek through and through - I know new technology takes time to become more widely used.
My issues with bitcoin weren't due to low sales volume, if I was frustrated with that I would have dropped it 4 months after accepting it when sales leveled off at less than 1% and stayed that way (actually, they declined further) for the next year and 8 months I accepted it.

The chart isn't manipulated at all. 
It actually *uses* my raw sales to create these datapoints. 
The only difference is that the axis is not labeled with the *exact* number of dollars I made, leaving the graph to serve as a visual representation of Bitcoin *relative* to fiat. 
Just because I'm *not disclosing my sales to the internet* doesn't mean I'm manipulating data. 
On the contrary, I *used those very sales* to create this graph as I felt it better to visually portray that raw data and allowing the reader to make the visual comparison rather than simply one graph of "percent difference in sales." 
To me, a graph showing "Bitcoin sales 5% more than fiat today, 10% less than fiat yesterday" would be more "manipulated" than a graph simply made up of raw data points.

It isn't necessarily about a merchant directly giving the consumer a 2% discount (although since the Bitcoin economy is still small that is essentially what we are seeing currently) but rather that goods and services will be priced according to their true market value instead of them having an additional 3-4% tacked on to account for MSFs, chargebacks, and the like.

While I totally agree that storing credit card numbers (not even in plain text, but at all) is a serious issue on the part of the business, my point is that Bitcoin makes this a non-issue.
Right now companies receive your plain-text credit card number and *have the choice* to store it or not. Businesses with good security practices will *not* store the number, but that doesn't mean others will be as vigilant. 
Credit card transactions are "pull" transactions so you as a consumer provides the merchant with [for the sake of argument] total access to your account and you have to trust the merchant to only "pull" the agreed amount out of your account.
Bitcoin, like cash, is a "push" transaction, so you only "push" as much to the merchant as needed. The merchant only has access to the amount of BTC you determined. 
In a pull transaction the merchant opens your account and pulls out the amount you agreed to. In a push transaction *you* open your account and push to the merchant what is agreed to.
UPS Example:
You want to ship a package from you to me. You go to the UPS store and they tell you it will be $20. 
Card: You hand the merchant your card and they swipe it through the POS which opens your account and pulls $20 out into the UPS account. Good to go.
BTC: The merchant shows you a one-time-use receiving address and waits for that address to receive $20. Good to go.
Both systems work great when the merchant is honest, but a nefarious merchant can, when using the card, pull $200 instead of $20 and you would have no clue until your statement came.
With BTC the merchant can only receive what you sent them and not a penny more. 
How push v pull transactions look on a code level:
**Pull transaction through Stripe**
    Stripe_Charge::create(array("amount" =&gt; $TOTAL_AMOUNT,
                                "currency" =&gt; "usd",
                                "card" =&gt; $token));
You are trusting the merchant to keep $TOTAL_AMOUNT the amount you agreed to, and common sense says a merchant that wants to stay in business would be honest, but unfortunately this doesn't account for the high school student behind the counter not being as honest as the business owner.
**Push TX with Bitcoin** [below is a pseudo-code copy of the logic I use on my site to process BTC payments]
    $ADDRESS_BALANCE = &lt;!-- this variable is actually the output of a script that I have which monitors the blockchain and spits out the real-time balance of the receiving address provided to the customer --&gt;
    $INVOICE_TOTAL = &lt;!-- the amount expected --&gt;
    if( $ADDRESS_BALANCE &gt;= $INVOICE_TOTAL ) { // process payment }
So in this case the merchant cannot change a thing on the programming level to steal more than what you agreed to. They can hypothetically alter $INVOICE_TOTAL to force you to send more than what was agreed to, but this would be analogous to giving you an invoice for $50, waiting for you to pay $50, then saying the invoice is now $100. 
And then comes data storage, what this entire article is about. In the card transaction the merchant stores the $token variable which is best described as a way to safely charge a card without actually storing the info on your server (if you're lucky, some store the raw card data without any encryption/PCI compliance). At any time, the merchant can call the $token variable and charge your card again. For a BTC transaction, the merchant has only stored the public address from which you sent the funds. So anyone wanting to steal from you would be able to *see* your address but never be able to *access* it.

Yes, a Visa debit card provides one degree of separation but at the end of the day, if someone is able to make a withdrawal from my bank account using only a 16 digit number embossed on the front of a plastic card, I'd call that direct access.

Accepting Bitcoin isn't as easy a just dropping in a plugin.
There's the accounting work involved (a valid point brought up by the reddit admins when asked about BTC), employee training on how to handle BTC transactions (case in point: the technical glitches (BTC isn't even v1.0 yet. There's still a few hiccups here and there, and many businesses would rather not be guinea pigs when it comes to selling their products/services and would rather go with the system they *know* will work seamlessly), and finally, basic consumer perception. Here in we're all pretty well-versed in Bitcoin, but out in the "real world" there's a lot of skepticism surrounding BTC. I've personally lost customers and got in heated discussions with individuals who *swore* I was laundering money and my business was simply a front all because I accepted BTC, and other merchants have had [similar issues](Accepting BTC is a big decision for a business to make, and IMO it takes a motivated CEO like Patrick Byrne to make it happen, because those that accept BTC solely for the short-term marketing benefit will experience burnout after the initial wave of BTC customers dries up.

While off topic of Bitcoin directly [from the sidebar]


I believe this article and similar ones about data breaches - when posted in moderation - serves as a good reminder as to why exactly Bitcoin is better.
True, this article is only talking about UPS being hacked of credit card numbers, but the only reason this is news is because UPS is actually *storing* credit card numbers - direct access to your bank account. With push BTC transactions, all UPS would have had was the customer's sending public address and nothing more. 
@_date: 2014-07-01 16:42:43
The only difference is the method (and security) of the transaction.
Credit Cards are "pull" transactions in which the merchant has *full* access to your account and (by the grace of their honesty) only "pulls" out the amount you agreed upon (here's hoping they're a reputable merchant!)
Bitcoin (and cash) are "push" transactions in which you as a consumer "push" the proper amount from your account to theirs, meaning the merchant only has access to the amount agreed upon and nothing more. 
Personally, I've had my credit card info stolen more than once and since it is a "pull" system the fraudsters were able to empty my account. Conversely, I've never had anyone steal my cash or bitcoin in the process of a transaction because I'm only handing over the transaction total and not complete access to my entire account.

It's not that I *want* exposure to volatility, but rather that I want to use Bitcoin as it was intended, as a decentralized payment medium.
If I outsource BTC processing to a centralized third party then I'll just be in the same boat with BitPay as I am now with Visa/MC/PayPal.
The whole point of Bitcoin was to take back monetary control from the central banking houses (or government, whichever ideology floats your boat) and give it back to the individual person. 
If that individual turns around and gives total control of their newfound financial liberty to a third party corporation, it's starting the cycle of trusting big business to protect the interests of the citizenry all over again.

These "leaked" emails are actually emails from the ~~(months old) bitcointalk leak~~ EDIT: Possibly the Gox leak, not bitcointalk, as states that they did not use bitcointalk and I used this email for both bitcointalk and gox.
My dedicated coinbase email address has not seen a single spam email while my dedicated bitcointalk/gox email address (which is not connected to CB in any way) has been receiving CB hack spam.
EDIT: This does not negate the fact that it is horrible practice to allow the general public to query your database to see whether a given address is in your system, nor does it negate the fact that rate limiting exists for a legitimate reason.
CB said "but look, other services allow you to see whether a user has that email address in the system!" but in actuality they will simply say "email address/password combination false", so the attacker does not know whether they simply got the password wrong *or* if the email is invalid altogether.
Finally, linking IRL names to an email address for "usability" is stupid, especially in the wild west world of Bitcoin. We value our privacy and I'm guessing CB will see a significant decrease in users after they not only openly acknowledged they give out our names, but *defended* the practice.

Since all this data comes from my own store, I don't really have "outside" review. However I'll do my best to outline how I came to these numbers.
- Bitcoin transaction speed
   - [Avg] Bitcoin transaction time: 1 minute
   - [Avg] Fiat transaction time: 8 days = 11520 minutes.
   - Percent difference: 1151900%. 
- Bitcoin vs fiat order size
   - Easy, just percent difference between fiat and BTC sales. While I'm not going to give out my *raw* data, I can tell you another interesting informational snippet: While BTC users spend 10% more, there is a 11% *reduction* in return customers when looking at BTC vs fiat. This could possibly be due to the fact that the majority of fiat sales are part of our target demographic whereas a portion of Bitcoin sales were simply to "show support". The true test will be after a year, and with outliers (such as adoption day and Black Friday) removed. 
- Portion of sales in Bitcoin
   - Similar to above, I simply related the number of Bitcoin sales (since adoption) to the total gross sales.
- Bitcoin sales on Black Friday
   - Again, just Bitcoin Sales/Total Sales.

I would say give them some time. 
Bitcoin completely turns the way orders are processed on its head and it's certainly difficult to educate all employees on how to handle Bitcoin transactions overnight.
Their job is to come in each day and answer customers' questions, not stay up to date on the latest financial market technology. 
You have to remember that the customer service representative you are talking to is most likely someone working a 9-5 job, not a crypto-enthusiast like us.
I've been accepting BTC for over a year now and still my employees don't really have a full grasp on how BTC payments are processed, and I don't blame them. 
Sure, they can confirm payment, and even help a customer with the basics of payment processing, but as soon as there is any sort of hiccup or need for a refund, they have to send the support ticket over to me because they (again, as to be expected) have not spend weeks reading up on the Bitcoin protocol and do not have an innate knowledge of how Bitcoin works. 
And since were not even at v1 yet, it's still a pretty dirty and to-the-point UI so CSRs used to working on a support dashboard with big "open ticket", "update order", and "process refund" buttons are forced to relearn everything.

For those that offer it, I certainly use 2FA.
But some of my vendors don't even have a functioning ecommerce site - in business there's this mentality that if it's not broken why fix it - and a lot of companies have gotten by for decades without the internet and don't see the necessity when their CEO just recently got a cell phone and still thinks the internet is just a fad. 
So their security practices aren't the best. 
I remember ordering a few gallons of glue and when I called the company (they don't have a working site), Marge (their ~70 y/o sales rep who couldn't figure out how to email me my invoice for the life of her) answered and took my card details over the phone, *wrote them by hand* on a piece of paper, then walked over to the cc machine to process the payment. 
I can only guess that in their office is a piece of paper with hundreds of customers' credit card details scribbled on it as Marge punches them digit by digit into the dial up machine.

I do not use Coinbase, I use a custom implementation.


If a transaction is not broadcast within 15 minutes I contact the customer to see whether they sent payment. Whenever the customer says they did send payment I ask them what wallet they used. That's how I know it's Coinbase. 
Blockchain.info wallet, MultiBit, Electrum, QT, Mycelium, and others all seem to broadcast instantaneously [Android Bitcoin wallet seems to have a couple minute delay, nothing too serious].
Coinbase just seems to take a lot longer in broadcasting some transactions. 
I personally use Coinbase for most of my Bitcoin exchanging and when I send funds to/from Coinbase I never personally experience a delay. 
But once in a while Coinbase seems to take a little bit longer in broadcasting transactions.

Too often I've found people either blindly against or blindly in favor of Bitcoin, with neither side backing up their arguments with actual data.

That includes client fees and conversion to fiat fees.
So in reality, those fees aren't even transaction fees; as more suppliers begin to accept BTC (which I strongly believe they do considering I'm sending them thousands of dollars at a time using a credit card, sometimes over international borders, all of which mean more fees for them) those "fees" will go down as I will not have to convert to USD to buy materials.

To circumvent this just set up an "account" system of your own where someone can fund their account with a set amount of Bitcoin, and then you can "bill" that account as needed.
Once the account is depleted just notify the user by email and pause the service until the account is replenished.

I understand the ease of installation factor but it looks like you're undermining one of Bitcoin's greatest features, total decentralization.

Overstock uses Coinbase to process payments. Both BitPay and Coinbase operate basically the same way: take BTC from customer, sell on market, and give fiat to merchant. None of these merchants actually touch the Bitcoins they "receive". In actuality, their respective payment processor accepts the Bitcoins and provides the merchant with the equivalent amount of fiat. Using one over another is simply by developer's preference (and a few differences in the service) however neither is "better" for the Bitcoin economy. 
The *true* support comes from merchants who accept BTC, hold their BTC, and use it to pay suppliers/employees. Currently the Bitcoin economy is too small to support such a "closed loop" system, however there are a few merchants abound that have been able to achieve such a model. *These* are the true supporters as merchants who accept and immediately sell their Bitcoin actually cause a depressive effect on the market (imperceivable due to the market's size, but existent nonetheless). When merchants hold and *utilize* Bitcoin in covering expenses, it reduces market volatility - less BTC-&gt;fiat "dumps" and more casual use in transactions means goods/services can be priced in BTC rather than a USD conversion. If I know my supplier will be selling the required materials for 2 BTC this month, next, and six months from now, I too can price *my* goods at a fixed BTC price and keep it there because in this closed loop economy the value of USD is irrelevant when I can cover all my expenses in BTC.

Coinbase is notorious for being less-than-expeditious when it comes to broadcasting transactions to the network.
When you click "Send" in your Coinbase account it can take anywhere from 10 seconds to 10 hours for the first peer to see the transaction.
As a merchant, this is the most frustrating thing because Coinbase generally attracts Bitcoin newcomers so when they try to make a purchase/transaction for the first time CB delays, and the newcomer's first interaction with BTC is a negative one (Bitpay will cancel an invoice after 15 minutes of nonpayment, and some merchants like myself will not even process an order without the tx being broadcast to the network). 
Then the Bitcoin newcomer comes yelling to the merchant saying that we used BTC to purposely steal their money, and it's difficult to explain to them how one of the most trusted and widely used exchanges and wallets is in fact not as efficient as their sleek blue responsive website would lead you to believe.
Just a preemtive to those who say "I've never had these issues with CB before" or "you're just spreading FUD, GTFO buttcoiner" (because I get those whenever I bring up CB's tx delays):
- CB is my go-to exchange for selling BTC. They provide a great service and their site is easy to navigate and great for introducing the general population to BTC. 
- We need to recognize where companies are successful and where they need improvement. CB is successful in new-user and merchant adoption. CB can however improve on their tx broadcast speeds.
- Just because you haven't personally had this issue doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Ask any BTC merchant what they think of CB and if they handle payments natively (ie do not use a third party such as BitPay or Coinbase that does all the "dirty BTC work") they will immediately begin telling you about tx delays. 
- Whenever I have a customer whose Bitcoin transaction is borked it *always* is Coinbase transaction delays. ALWAYS. So much so that I had to add a manual "Place Order" button on my BTC checkout page. Usually, my site monitors the network and as soon as payment is received for your order, the site processes your order. But not with coinbase. With coinbase you have to send the BTC, manually press "Place Order", then one my employees or myself has to manually confirm the tx in the blockchain before processing the order.

Oracle_of_Knowledge, you are completely correct. I've updated the page to reflect that.


From a merchant's perspective, a transaction begins when the customer hands you the payment and ends when you receive it. For bitcoin, that happens in one minute - when the transaction is sent.

How about [at least] once a year?
When you run a business a lot of your information is publicly accessible, and since you run a business there's an expectation that you have some money so you're a prime target for identity theft.
At least once a year I have fraudulent charges in my account, and it's not as though I'm doing anything nefarious, it's just that each time you pull out your card it is another chance to attack, and as a business I'm pulling out my card quite often to cover various expenses. 
My most recent fraudulent charge was $3,800 for concert tickets or something. 
The first time I saw a fraudulent charge in my account I freaked out thinking I was out a few thousand dollars, but now it's just become another boring aspect of business - calling the bank and proving I'm not flying 20 people to Europe for a weekend concert. 
Granted, the banks have never taken longer than a couple weeks to reimburse me for the fraud (something Bitcoin clearly cannot and will not do) but the only reason the banks are so willing to reimburse you is because they know this is such a common occurrence.
I started accepting BTC last April. Since then I've had three fraudulent charges in my various fiat accounts and 0 in my BTC wallets.

I personally have two wallets on Blockchain.info alone (neither of which I've used in the past 9 months), not to mention the numerous other services that publish their user numbers as a representative number of BTC holders.

So should Overstock accept my offer of being the first vendor to sell merchandise to them for BTC, my business will generate BTC revenue through both [existing] B2C sales as well as B2B sales and then use a portion of that BTC revenue to pay employee wages. 
While the majority of my business expenses are wholesale orders and large pallets, I certainly can purchase various office supplies with BTC through Overstock which would close the hole even more!

Completely agree that a n of 1 is not going to represent the entire economy, however with a lack of *any* merchant data besides BitPay's "number of adopting merchants", I figured I should contribute what data I've compiled so far.

All sales are represented in USD at the time of the transaction. Since the USD is less volatile than Bitcoin, I pegged all numbers in USD so the volatility point is moot. Black Friday's 29% increase was an *actual* 29% increase, not artificially inflated by the high exchange rate. I do not convert immediately, but rather on a biweekly basis or when I need to make an order with a supplier. I sell mainly through coinbase however I also use CampBX on occasion. The price I sell it as is whatever it's going for at that moment.

Because usually when a business receives an email saying "I will start supporting your business when you start accepting my magic internet money" they either delete it straight away or respond back (and rightfully so) that they aren't about to change their entire payment processing system so that one person can buy an $18 widget.
I've been accepting BTC in my store for over a year now and I *still* get the culty-emails from people trying to "convince" me to accept Bitcoin so that they can "support" my business. When I tell them I already accept Bitcoin, they disappear, never to return and "support [my] business."
We have all these people going around proselytizing for merchant adoption, but as soon as merchants begin accepting BTC they are forgotten as we go and search for the next business to convert.
@_date: 2014-07-17 15:39:33
While I agree that in general merchants who accept BTC will be paying less in transaction related fees I think we shouldn't expect every merchant who adopts BTC to immediately institute a discount.
While merchants may be saving 2-3% per transaction they still are vulnerable to an unstable exchange rate and they take on added risk in accepting BTC. 
Again, I'm not saying all BTC merchants shouldn't provide some sort of incentive to purchaee, but rather that we need to look at a BTC transaction from both sides, not just the consumer side. 
If we want BTC to truly succeed we can't keep telling merchants "use bit pay it's just like getting USD" because they won't actually be handling BTC but rather bitpay tokens denominated in USD. 
I myself am a merchant who accepts BTC and I too offer a substantial discount for BTC purchases. But as a merchant I am susceptible to volatility as I do not cash out immediately or use bitpay/coinbase. I received a few orders back when it was $635/coin and now that we're down to $625 I lost 2% right there. 
Granted, volatility now is much less than before, but I just wanted to make the point that we should be happy if any merchant adopts BTC and we shouldn't expect them to give us discounts when they are making a much riskier financial move in accepting then than we are spending them. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 16:16:03
Love to see businesses help the Bitcoin economy by holding as much of their Bitcoin revenue rather than immediately liquidating it. The more businesses who use Bitcoin in everyday transactions rather than dump it for cash immediately upon receipt will help curb volatility while at the same time producing greater consumer options for use.

Merchants don't want to use a currency if they have to have a third party intermediary to protect them from volatility.
Merchants will begin to adopt Bitcoin at a quicker rate when they can actually hold their Bitcoin revenue for more than two days without it crazily dropping or rising in value. And contrary to what you hear on merchants do *not* want the currency they use to go "To the moon", they want a currency that will be able to hold its value for longer than a day. If it can shoot up, it can just as easily (and arguably more easily) plummet and merchants are well aware of this.
So currently you have two camps of Bitcoin accepting merchants: Those that use BitPay/Coinbase that accept Bitcoin for the marketing advantage, and those that accept BTC natively (no third party payment processors) to support the network.
True, those that use BitPay/Coinbase don't really care about volatility because they are protected by the intermediary. But in the same vein, they don't really care about Bitcoin at all, as it is just a flash-in-the-pan marketing gimmick for them and not used for its comparative advantage over fiat. 
Instead of creating third party services that attempt to "protect" merchants and consumers from the very-real issue of volatility we need to work on minimizing the volatility itself. 
When we have to rely on third party services to protech both merchants and consumers from volatility, it instills in people that Bitcoin is inherently unsuitable as a currency as it (perceivably) requires a litany of third party trusted services just for it to act like "normal" money.

I actually started with a line but moved to an area because the intention of this post was to show how Bitcoin can beat fiat sales, or at least compete with them. So where the orange is visible but not the blue, Bitcoin "won" that day in sales. Where the blue is visible over orange, fiat "won" that day. The graph wasn't intended to be studied intently, but rather to serve as a visual aid to show "oh yeah, Bitcoin sales are quite close to fiat sales, and no, they did not precipitously decline immediately after adoption."

Be wary when using coinbase to pay merchants who do not use coinbase themselves to accept BTC. While coinbase-to-coinbase transactions are instantaneous, they sometimes have a delay in pushing transactions to the network and merchants who use bitpay to accept BTC will void the invoice due to nonpayment but then a few hours later coinbase will finally broadcast the transaction.

If a pool controls more than 50% of the network it allows them to commit a [51% attack]( 
While pools reaching 50% of the market share is not unheard of, GHASH.io has been acting quite aggressive and the fear is that the pool owner (if they so wish) could commit such an attack. 
So there has been a drive for miners to move away from the GHASH pool and toward P2P, a decentralized peer to peer pool that does not have an overarching "leader" capable of using the hashing power for nefarious reasons.

It's very easy, no matter the volume. When you swipe a credit card, it authorizes with the card company and sends back verification to your POS. With Bitcoin, the customer sends the BTC and your POS will "authorize" it with the blockchain, automatically send back verification, and process the transaction.

Every time I receive an order that does not have a corresponding payment broadcasted, I contact the customer and the issue is ALWAYS Coinbase. 
It can take anywhere between an hour and 6 hours for CB to broadcast a transaction.
While I can manually override an order being canceled for nonpayment, third party services like BitPay will nullify the invoice, so by the time CB actually sends the payment the receiving merchant has already canceled the order (IIRC BitPay has a 15 minute window).

See the top of the comment chain. Back in Q3 and Q4 of 2013 (coincidentally around the time of the price rally), Bitcoin accepting merchants reported very significant sales. Bitcoin has a market cap of over $3.5 billion. There's money behind it, and when they want to, Bitcoiners spend so much so that companies clamor to being accepting Bitcoin.
But as the price plummeted and stayed essentially stagnant all year 2014, the people who bought it high HODL'ed waiting for it to rise, merchants stopped seeing sales and removed Bitcoin as an option, and then when the once-in-a-blue-moon bitcoiner comes around to spend money at one of the merchants that used to accept Bitcoin, they no longer do.

I still accept it on my site but have moved the option to a more obscure location, and I have seen an increase in revenue (with the business' growth rate taken into consideration) that is validating the A/B test results.
My next split-test will see if removing the Bitcoin option altogether will show similar increases in revenue. 
In 2013 Bitcoin sales were a significant portion of my revenues, and I was seeing sales from all around the world. 
But come 2014, sales just dropped. Actually, since I love stats, in 2014 Bitcoin sales as a real value [fell by 1.7%]( (page 4) over the year (not comparing it to 2013). Compared to 2013, Bitcoin sales in 2014 fell by 19%. 
As the business has grown and Bitcoin sales have dropped, Bitcoin sales relative to USD have gone from significant (15-30% a month) to statistically insignificant (0.1%-2%). I'm expecting Bitcoin sales to be at ~0.01%-0.08% by the end of Q4 2015. 
@_date: 2015-04-06 20:28:09


I'll be running another A/B test in a couple weeks to test this point, but it looks like unfortunately I'm actually losing money every day I continue to accept Bitcoin.


I thought about this which is why I measured revenue, so to answer your point, yes, this is measured real-value dollars lost.


At the end of the day, I am not seeing any additional profits from Bitcoin sales. From the data I have been seeing, I may actually be losing profit from accepting it.

Merchant here.
Why should I subsidize your exchange fees? What incentive do I have to reduce the price for Bitcoin when everyone who uses USD pays the stated price?
If you want merchants to begin accepting your new internet money, you can't say "Take my magic beans, but I want a 1% discount off if you take them!", merchants will look at you like you're a nutjob.
And before you say "But you're saving 3-5% in merchant service fees and chargebacks!!!1!":
Chargebacks are negligible, anyone who says Bitcoin gives them a tangible advantage RE chargebacks is either selling porn (or other high risk products), or lying.
Merchant Service Fees: Credit Cards take ~3% in fees. Bitcoin is ~1% in fees, *plus* the cost of acceptance: 
In [this thread]( the popular opinion is that it is the merchant's fault for not training their employees to accept Bitcoin. If we really want to believe that, then we have to recognize that it *costs money* to train employees on accepting Bitcoin, however as OP in that thread said, *they were the first person to try to spend Bitcoin*. 
So what incentive does a merchant have to adopt a new currency, train all their employees on how to use it, work with their accountant and board to get the logistics of accepting a new currency worked out, only to find that *there is no one (sorry, I mean one person) using it as a currency*.
So to ask them to, on top of all of this, to provide an *additional* discount for your Bitcoin, is a little much to ask.
Oh, and on the subject of "cost of acceptance": I ran an A/B test [similar to Mozilla]( and saw very similar results: By prominently displaying Bitcoin acceptance on my site I was *losing* 5.8% of my gross sales. So, sure, I'm saving 1% on MSFs, but I'm losing 5.8% upfront on just revenue. 
Bitcoin needs to provide value to the market that does not already exist. If it's up to merchants to subsidize Bitcoin adoption it will collapse as a currency. And if merchants like Overstock and myself only see less than 1% of our sales in Bitcoin and actually a loss of revenue by accepting it, we will re-evaluate our position on the currency.
Businesses currently accept Bitcoin because it's potentially a source for more revenue. But if the numbers say otherwise, businesses have no reason to prop up the Bitcoin economy.

What I'm trying to say about the name is that they're clearly just a bunch of annoying little shits, yet believes that is actually some sort of impediment to mass adoption. 
*They* are not what is holding us back.
is actually a lot of former and current Bitcoiners who just got fed up with the rabid community over here. It's all a big joke, and the fact that takes them so seriously just gives them more fodder.
I mean, you've spent more than half of your day arguing on the internet over a parody subreddit. That's the kind of stuff laughs at. 


The same can be said about I've already covered the proselytizing, witch hunting of "non supporters", but what about all the times posts come up about "So and so had their money confiscated... wouldn't have happened if they used Bitcoin!"
And this is what I'm (clearly unsuccessfully) trying to get at. can *never* take a step back and look at themselves in a mirror.

Even with payment processors, accepting Bitcoin isn't as easy as we often hear. 


My original post linked to an A/B test run by the Mozilla foundation (arguably a very large organization) where they found that [publicly] accepting Bitcoin would *lose* them $140k.
For my own business, the loss rate for accepting Bitcoin is 5.8%. That means if I didn't have Bitcoin as a payment option, my gross revenue would rise by 5.8%.
The savings in accepting BTC are around 1-2% (not counting the time it took to train employees - who have still not processed one transaction, the occasional hiccup as detailed in the links above, or volatility since I accept BTC natively and not through a payment processor - what's the point of using a decentralized p2p currency if the first step is to centralize payment processing?). 
So even with the high end 2% savings, I'm losing 5.8% by simply accepting Bitcoin, so I'm net -3.8%. No matter the volume of sales generated by Bitcoin, the proportional loss of sales will always outweigh the proportional savings due to processing fees.
Oh, and if your organization is large enough that you're theoretically able to subsidize that loss with "savings from smaller processing fees", your overall transaction volume is likely at the point where you will be paying only 0.8-1.5% for each credit card transaction, making the hypothetical savings a moot point.

Unfortunately the only people capable of removing me are rational thinkers as well.
I am really disappointed in all the hate thrown my way. I don't know why I expected a respectful and rational discussion, but I certainly didn't expect to be immediately written off as a troll.
I've been in Bitcoin for a while now. I'm not some troll plant here to destroy this community from within.
But instead of reading what I have to say, people just mash that downvote button and yell troll, which is ironic because that's the very thing I'm trying to address.
I don't even know why I'm writing this right now, no one is going to read it and it will just be downvoted to oblivion because it is critical of Bitcoin.
What a shame.
We had so much potential, but we've turned this forum into an echo chamber, and even attempts to turn back that trend are met with rabid hostility.

I don't consider myself to be some Bitcoin Jesus - that position is already taken by Roger Ver.
There have been conversations both in modmessages as well as publicly in the forum (although they have been downvoted and therefore hidden from immediate view...ironic) as to what to do about it, but there never was a definitive solution.
I found that whenever I would go into a thread and have this conversation we're having but on a smaller scale within that thread, by just kind of tempering the up! uP! UP! or "let's stalk _____ until they accept Bitcoin" attitudes with publicly available information, the rest of the thread was full of really balanced and high quality content. 
It was my hope that if that conversation was started on a grander scale that the community could see itself from the outside looking in and return to something more like we were back in '11 - '13 - optimistic for the future but rational about the current position - instead of what we see now: *believing* we're *right on the edge* of skyrocketing from $250 a coin to $2,500, and calling all those who disagree a troll.

Scenario 1 is very possible, reddit has gotten very good at cracking down on "voting rings" but that means unique individuals on the same network are sometimes considered to be colluding.
Scenario 2 is true, there's trolls and bots downvoting a lot of things in here. While we can ban the trolls from commenting (if, you see, the "fuck off coinbase" comment that was on this post automatically disappeared after a couple of seconds) we can't ban them from voting, that's reddit proper's deal.
Scenario 3 is probably the most significant one. I've seen quality OC flounder in /new, and I've seen junk rehashed articles shot to the front page for 18 hours. 
It's all about the time of day you post, the current activity of the particular subreddit - which is particularly low right now, giving those first few downvotes more weight and thereby keeping you in /new and not /rising or /hot - but you already know this stuff as the CEO of coinbase haha.

Many of the mods of lurk in - when you spend hours of your day every single day of your life reading through vitriolic comments and posts about Bitcoin, sometimes it's nice to relax with a laugh at the expense of a technology we're clearly passionate about (otherwise we wouldn't volunteer our time to mod here). 
exists because *freaks out* whenever there is a criticism of Bitcoin. Buttcoiners find it *hilarious* that truly believes there is a global conspiracy against them (I know you said you do not believe that, however that is the prevailing opinion here - again, I don't have a well-organized chart to show this, but if you spend as much time here as I do, you wouldn't really be questioning that fact).
The fact that gets so up in arms over a subreddit called *BUTT*coin is what I'm getting at. We think we're these captains of industry, on the ground floor of an economic revolution, yet we claim a forum called *BUTT*coin is undermining us. Come on. That's really funny. 


Oh, that's *certainly* the case. But you know that saying about throwing stones in glass houses... when we're organizing a list of people who oppose Bitcoin, harass merchants who stop accepting it, and call all dissenters paid trolls, we can't really be pointing fingers saying "Yeah but they started it!" We should be above that rancor, yet the *only* thing that spurred this discussion is me joining them to show that we can't really yell at them as a crazy cult when we exhibit many of the same symptoms. And that comes to...


I strongly believe in Bitcoin. I've developed a few Bitcoin programs, and use Bitcoin in the inner workings of my business. I've gone so far as to develop a decentralized merchant payment portal for Bitcoin (no BitPay or Coinbase), so suffice to say I'm pretty active in Bitcoin and in particular. And yes, acts a lot like a cult, whether we want to hear it or not.


My inbox is currently being inundated with people yelling at me about that very thing, so I'm sorry if I made it sound like I was making that statement about you in particular, I wasn't. But like I said above, if you have never seen those viewpoints here you probably haven't been here for longer than a couple of days. 


The only reason I became a "mod" there (used in quotes because if one looks at the modlist they'll see I'm a mod in name only and have no powers there) was to start this very conversation how is so against dissent that the second one of the moderators associates with people with opposing viewpoints, there are demands to remove me.

I've been accepting Bitcoin for two years now and have continued to provide usage statistics from day one:
- When you first begin accepting Bitcoin, you will see a rise in sales as the Bitcoin community rallies to support a new merchant (this rally effect has since fallen).
    - [This chart]( details my first ~4 months of accepting Bitcoin. As you see, it's not *crazy volume*, but still statistically significant.
- However after that initial flood of sales, your Bitcoin revenue will crash. 
    - [Here is a report of my BTC sales through the end of last year](
        - As you can see, sales just plummeted through 2014, and if I continued it through Q1 of 2015, the decline in BTC sales actually increases, and I'm now estimating my BTC sales to be ~0.01%-0.08% by the end of Q4 2015.
    - Also, there is the cost of acceptance: 
        - The Mozilla Foundation ran an [A/B test]( and found that having a Bitcoin option reduced their conversions by 7.5%. I ran a similar test and found that removing the BTC option from my site increased revenue by 5.8%. 
        - Make sure your employees/customer service reps understand Bitcoin, otherwise you'll get torn apart in the court of PR when there is the inevitable issue with a payment.
In sum, add Bitcoin if you want to support the currency or because you want some short term sales. But don't expect significant revenue from Bitcoin after a couple months of acceptance.
@_date: 2015-04-08 03:04:02


I've addressed this before. I couldn't care less about how much I make with Bitcoin, I was well aware it wasn't a large market. Also, it's not the quality of the product considering the business is growing at over 100% every year. But making an attack at what I do is easier than addressing what I say. 


Look at Overstock. Look at Wordpress. Look at Mozilla. Bitcoin isn't 5%. It's 0.02%. And the costs of accepting Bitcoin, including the costs of the community (that bar that accepted Bitcoin and put in an ATM and then removed it after it cost them more money then they received is now receiving negative reviews on Yelp for them "not supporting Bitcoin") often either break even with, or outweigh, the benefits of accepting it for many companies. 


When they're 0.02% of your potential customers, they and their friends harass you and your customer service reps about accepting Bitcoin until you finally relent and then they never place an order, and they demand a discount if you take their Bitcoins, sometimes it's just cheaper not to accept Bitcoin anymore.

I personally approve every comment that isn't doxxing or otherwise breaking reddit rules. I strongly believe in the freedom of speech, even if it's saying I'm an idiot - first they came.
The community has made that decision. Every time someone posts a dissenting viewpoint, instead of forming a counter argument, downvotes, calls the Suppressive Person a troll, and reports them to the mods.
Every time is linked, it is reported so much so that it is automatically removed by automod.
Every time someone gets their jimmies rustled, they message the mods demanding we ban the "trolls". When we read the "offending" comment chain and say that we allow open discussion, they get indignant. 
@_date: 2015-04-07 02:50:47
I expected low sales from the get go, by no stretch of the mind could one believe that they would consistently receive a significant portion of their revenue in Bitcoin.
Sales dropped off back at the end of 2013/beginning of 2014, so if I were "butthurt" about that, I should have said something way back then if that were the case.
[Regarding your statement the product is overpriced]( I won't go into a discussion on how it *is* the market price at higher quality and yada yada yada, but considering the business has continued to grow at a *very* significant pace, I'm pretty sure it's not my product or price point that is holding back [Bitcoin] sales.
I keep seeing people trying to organize proselytizing campaigns to pressure/harass merchants to accept Bitcoin and make all these blatantly wrong promises and businesses are receiving *hundreds* of copypasta emails/calls/tweets telling them that they NEED to take Bitcoin. And when they finally relent and start accepting it? Everyone is gone, pressuring the next business to accept it.
The organizations that do accept Bitcoin and release their sales data (not just me, but Overstock and Mozilla as well) report not just low, but *dismal* sales. Like, less than half a percent low.
Those businesses that relent to the pressure and accept Bitcoin only to find there is no userbase and subsequently drop it as a payment option are then publicly witch hunted for not being "supporters of Bitcoin".
Yet every day there is a post in trying to organize another door-knocking campaign, or another post saying "I won't spend Bitcoin until the price is $XXXX.XX", or "I won't buy something with Bitcoin unless there is a discount". 
And when someone simply says "you know, that doesn't make much sense. Look at the data released by Overstock, or the data released by Mozilla", they're immediately downvoted, reported (as a mod, every time you hit that report button I have to read the context and make a decision), and called a troll. 
Whenever I would post data showing Bitcoin in a positive light (in the first few months of accepting it), it was shot to the front page and made the rounds in the Bitcoin world.
But now every time I post data (since I've been accepting Bitcoin for 2 years and the "let's support a new merchant" rush is gone, my BTC sales are ~0.2-1% of my gross now) it is considered a "sampling error", is downvoted, and I'm literally called a troll.
When Mozilla (obviously a pretty large organization that has used big data to their advantage - they clearly know statistics) posted their data regarding the 7.5% reduction in conversions and subsequent potential $140k lost revenue, it's immediately deemed an error on Mozilla's behalf, never taking a moment to think that maybe they themselves were wrong.
Dissenting viewpoints/*statistics* are not only downvoted in there are demands to remove them outright. 
The fact that many demand to remove free speech that simply challenges their viewpoints scares me.
The fact that whenever someone says something that is not necessarily against Bitcoin but just a bit questioning, they are called "trolls" and downvoted scares me.
If you take a step back looks so much like a cult. It has nothing to do with the underlying technology of Bitcoin, but the community has gotten so rabid and so opposed to dissent that it has really prevented advancement. 
As for me being invited as a mod of (and now the demands for me to be removed as a mod here when, if one saw the modlog they would see I am one of the most active mods here), it was all a joke to show exactly how crazy some people here are about dissent - simply because I was made a "mod" and talk to people disagrees with, I'm a [Suppressive Person]( and must be removed.
For fuck's sake, they're called BUTTCOIN. If we're in on the ground floor of some revolutionary new p2p decentralized cryptocurrency tantamount to the internet of our generation and an internet forum called *BUTTCOIN* can destroy us, we're royally fucked.

The fact that takes these stupid trolls so seriously is my point - they're meaningless, but by claiming they're part of some giant conspiracy to undermine Bitcoin, we just give them more stuff to point and laugh at.

Definitely not the case for me, I've had *numerous* people tell me that I have the easiest and slickest Bitcoin checkout option out there.


That's exactly how I felt until the results from my 90 day split test came in. 
If you've frequented for a while now you'll know that I've been a very vocal proponent of merchant adoption, and I've always backed up my statements with statistics (which, when they were positive, were eaten up by propelled to position  and sent around to businesses in those little proselytizing pamphlets). So when the data showed me that accepting Bitcoin was not *only* minimally profitable (0.1-2% of gross revenue with an avg savings of 1.5% per tx) but also causing an overall *reduction* in revenue, I was a bit surprised.


I've been accepting Bitcoin for over two years and have a dataset containing tens of thousands of datapoints. Not so small. As for representativeness: 
I'm a conventional goods manufacturer. I don't make ASICs, I don't sell computer equipment, I don't provide cloudhashing contracts - I manufacture products the general population uses.
So my business provides interesting insight into use of Bitcoin among the general population.
I've posted my Bitcoin data previously, and long-time subscribers to might remember how for the first 3 months of accepting Bitcoin, it competed heavily with USD (when looking at proportion of gross). There is a market of people willing to spend Bitcoin if they really see fit.
The fact that Bitcoin sales have leveled out around 7-10 per month shows that this is basically the market size for conventional businesses for now. Certainly, if you're selling mining hardware, digital goods, or darknet items, your Bitcoin sales will be much higher.
But for conventional businesses, &lt;1% of gross in Bitcoin sales is the current market size. For Overstock, it's 0.02%. My estimation is that by this time next year, my Bitcoin sales will be around 0.01%-0.08% (considering the BTC sales are slowly declining while USD sales are quickly rising as the business grows).

The reason I joined (which I had addressed countless times now, if you had read the *many* posts I've made rehashing the same exact thing but get immediately downvoted because I'm now a "troll") was to address the fact that is unable to see itself with a critical eye.

I'll freely admit that I came in here with the super optimistic "this is going to change the world" attitude and I'll also admit that I made a few posts that would now be laughed at as a bit blindly optimistic.
But after being here for a while and understanding more and more about Bitcoin, I wanted less to just talk about how *one day this will be big* and more about "ok, how do we fix the issues we see and really *make* this big?"


I wholeheartedly agree - Bitcoin had (and has) a lot of potential. But every time a newbie comes in here with a legitimate question or criticism, they're called a troll and downvoted. That's not what we need for mass adoption.

Well that's not very nice. What makes me dumb? 


[The business has grown at over 100% a year (disregarding Bitcoin sales) so I don't think it's my product that's the problem]( But I do find it funny that whenever I talk about the downsides of Bitcoin, instead of addressing the content of my statement, people attack me for my profession, as if my owning a soap manufacturing business somehow undermines my credibility.

I remove troll comments daily. What gets on my nerves is when every day new questions and skepticisms are met not with answers, but "concern troll" comments and downvotes.

Merchant's perspective:


Then why would I use it? I thought the whole selling point was fee-free/low-fee transactions?
2. You'll get all the bitcoin nerds


3. No chargebacks


Customer's perspective:


Do it because all the cool kids are doing it! But in all seriousness, if the only upside of Bitcoin over USD/fiat is that it is "cool", it's screwed.


See above.


The whole point of your post is that payment processors and/or merchants should subsidize Bitcoin as a payment option. You don't think those added costs would be passed on to the end customer?

@_date: 2015-04-07 18:11:50


I didn't think about putting together statistics on the divisiveness of the community over the past two years of moderating here, so I don't have them. So does that prove that I am a liar, or just that I spent more time actually moderating than calculating how many times people downvoted opposing viewpoints? 
Also, if I *had* those statistics, they would just be downvoted and called a "sampling error" just like when I or anyone else posts statistics that don't portray Bitcoin in a positive light.


Maybe it's hard for me to address the point(s) you are raising because I don't entirely understand your anger with me?
There are demands to remove me as a mod due to my "affiliation with trolls" (ie people who present dissenting viewpoints), so I apologize if I jumped to conclusions in thinking that was why you were mad at me as well.
So please tell me why you don't like me and I'll try to respond.


You mean by just countering the prevailing opinions with facts?


Kind of ironic when I'm the one being witch hunted for being a bought-and-paid government troll sent to undermine our economic revolution predicated on Bitcoin.


Well thank you for that at least. Bitcoin as a tool for internet commerce is and always will have value. But when the community that surrounds that tool goes around spouting conspiracies such as "the government and banks are colluding - in a forum called BUTTcoin - to undermine our revolution", rational thinkers leave and either end up as refugees in (go over there with an objective level head and you'll see very rational discussion on the positives and negatives of Bitcoin, and many "Buttcoiners" are still heavily in Bitcoin, both ideologically and financially, they just despise the cultish nature of this subreddit), or they leave Bitcoin altogether frustrated over the lost potential.
I know there is a lot of hate surrounding me right now, but if you could believe it, I'm actually doing this to *benefit* Bitcoin. We've become so insulated as a community that we refuse to even accept there are downsides, and it leads to conspiracies becoming "common knowledge" here. 
I don't want to see Bitcoin fail because of the cult that surrounds it.
Unfortunately instead of taking a step back and thinking critically about their own beliefs, I'll just be downvoted as another troll.
People call a cult not because they are part of a conspiracy to undermine our revolution, but because we as a community look and act just like a cult.
I consider myself a pretty intelligent person, and I would never want to say that I was fleeced by the promises of a cult. But now that it's pretty evident that exhibits all the main facets of a cult and that cannot be denied, I hoped to use my unique position as a well-known user of Bitcoin, a Bitcoin merchant, and moderator of one of the largest Bitcoin forums for hopefully temper the rabidness.
Clearly when anyone from the outside tries to show the truth they are called a troll and downvoted.
I was hoping that hoping that I as a "Bitcoin insider", with my statistics, real-world application of Bitcoin, and years of experience, would be able to cut through the "concern troll"/"statist shill" conspiracies and get to the point I was making, but unfortunately it is pretty clear that the community has gone so far down the cultish rabbit hole there is little hope for return.

And the conspiracies that Buttcoin, the government, the banks, or me are trying to suppress Bitcoin is giving this subreddit's clout in the greater scheme of things way too much credit.
And it's just more fodder for Stop feeding the trolls. Every time you get all up in arms about it, they just post and comment more. Stop feeding the trolls and the trolls will go away.

There isn't a concerted suppression campaign against Bitcoin. Bitcoin's [lack of] growth is its own fault, it is not due to some shadowy outside force.
The fact that this is a common "fact" is what I'm talking about. When you start talking about shadowy forces suppressing you and refuse to talk to anyone who disagrees, it really does turn cultish. With the passing out of fliers, refusing to accept statistics (from *numerous* organizations), and refusing to talk to those who disagree, outsiders see bitcoin as a cult and are turned off. The Bitcoin community is currently its own impediment to growth.

Easy. Stop acting like a cult, circlejerk, echochamber, etc.


I joined as a joke and to make a point (the very point you are making for me) - for months now people have been calling me a troll simply for talking about Bitcoin's downsides when in fact I'm one of the most active and ideologically-aligned moderators here.
I figured if people are going to call one of the most active *Bitcoiners* a troll simply because they aren't participating in the RAH RAH pump, might as well give them something to talk about, eh?
I was hoping to start a conversation on how calls a cult, yet the second anyone speaks ill of Bitcoin, they are excommunicated and disregarded as a troll.
We've turned into an echochamber and I was hoping to turn it back by showing a dose of reality, however it is clear now that I was naive to think showing the truth would do anything other than embolden them against me.

@_date: 2015-04-07 05:51:45

If so, then why should I be removed? What is inherently wrong with It is simply a parody. I spend *hours* of my day every single day moderating it's nice to relax with a good laugh at the expense of something I know well. 
You post demanding I be removed is exactly why I became mod over there: to show how crazy has become. Simply because I joined a subreddit that is critical of Bitcoin, I must be a [Suppressive Person]( and therefore be removed. always calls a cult, when they should really look in the mirror. I should add that the cognitive dissonance and inability to see the clear cult mentality even when it is right in your face is just added comedy gold for @_date: 2015-04-06 16:17:45
I've addressed 98% of what you said in the thread I linked and I don't like sounding like a broken record, so I'll just let my previous statements speak for me.
As for this part:


Consumer demand is generally measured by the number of dollars you spend, not the volume of your proselytizing voice. 
For my business, "consumer demand" as a measure of the frequency someone asks if I accept Bitcoin is *massive* (numerous requests a month). 
The "consumer demand" when measuring how much these people actually spend is around 0.1% of my gross revenue - statistically insignificant.
How views economic demand: 
[I demand BITCOINNNNNNNNN](
@_date: 2015-04-08 02:37:31
Yes, because internet trolls on are mass-upvoting Coinbase posts to suppress them. Coinbase is cool, they're my primary exchange, but it's well known that they vote manipulate. It just looks like reddit has caught on. 
I've said it before and I'll say it again: If a bunch of internet trolls can undermine the impending economic revolution brought about by Bitcoin, Bitcoin will never succeed. Trolls are everywhere. Downvote and move on. 
As for you should organize a mass-email campaign to the reddit admins to get it banned because they make fun of the fact that we use Bitcoin.

The fact that we're now calling valid questions "concern trolling" is the point I'm trying to show (and the point that the rest of the world outside of has known for a long time now) - instead of having substantive discussions, downvotes opposing viewpoints and writes them off as trolls rather than taking a moment to think critically of their *own* beliefs. 
Unfortunately this point will not be received as I will just be written off as a "butthurt" buttcoiner. 
I was hoping that if someone who was in for years, not just on the sidelines but actively working in the development and implementation of the technology as well as one of the top mods of the subreddit came forward with the inconvenient truth, hopefully some would realize how far down the rabbit hole we have gone. 
But unfortunately I was clearly naive in believing showing reality would result in anything less than me being accused as a corporate bank shill and supressive troll.
@_date: 2015-04-07 18:55:41
I had no incentive to join I could have just stayed quiet and continued modding here while biting my tongue over the rabid community, but I didn't want to end like that.
Whether you want to acknowledge that fact or simply write me off as a troll or some butthurt ex-bitcoiner, that's up to you.
But from an objective viewpoint, what incentive do I have to instigate this discussion? Clearly it wasn't to generate sales for my business, so we can take out financial incentive. It wasn't to pump up (or depress) Bitcoin, as my years of comment history shows I am *not* a speculative trader. It's not to undermine the credibility of Bitcoin, considering I've spent the last two years closely relating my business to the Bitcoin community, so a loss of credibility for Bitcoin would mean a loss of credibility for me. 
So if I have *no* incentives to discredit Bitcoin, maybe I'm just being honest when I say that I'm trying to stop the descent into madness that has become commonplace in this subreddit.
@_date: 2015-04-07 17:33:58
I spend *hours* of my day - every single day - moderating this subreddit. If you've made a comment, if you've made a post, if you've reported something, I saw it.
Now, while I'm volunteering my time every single day moderating this subreddit I'm not putting together a clean and organized dataset to prove the community wrong.
But since I don't have that dataset you'll just call me a liar rather than taking into consideration that I have given the past two years of my life for the advancement and development of this currency.
I just find it humorous that in your mind, it is more rational that I am some long-term troll who spent two years as one of the most active moderators here simply to undermine Bitcoin, instead of the possibility that I am just telling the truth from my years of experience. 
@_date: 2015-04-08 02:22:42
I still just love how my simply asking for the ability for people to speak their mind about Bitcoin without being downvoted and called trolls automatically makes me a troll. 
And no, I did not have anything to do this. In fact, I'm the one that regularly goes through and approves all the (numerous) posts about the same topic when there's major news at Bitcoin companies that are reported as reposts, and removes the vitriolic trolls, but I guess that doesn't fit into your narrative of me being some corrupt troll plant here to destroy Bitcoin from within.
@_date: 2015-04-07 16:57:09
Ok look at this from an objective point of view. 
- This is a new person with a valid question regarding Bitcoin who comes to ask a question in the bitcoin subreddit, only to be called a "concern troll". If this is the case, we just turned off a potential new user, preventing the necessary growth of the user base. 
- or, this is a concerted effort by a shadowy group of individuals intent on destroying all freedoms on the Internet by asking questions on to prevent us from going to the moon. 
If you really think that Bitcoin's success is being hindered solely by a group of people who call themselves BUTTcoiners and it has nothing to do with the rabid and cultish community in this subreddit, maybe would be more fitting. 
@_date: 2015-04-07 04:44:20
How do we get that message across to the people? 
I've found that when I confront the cultists with reality in a thread, generally the rest of that thread is pretty decent conversation as everyone else can see the juxtaposition of the cult beliefs with reality and instead stick to a balanced discussion, but then the next thread that pops up is the same exact thing.
As you and referenced, we're turing away the very people we need - newcomers interested in this new digital currency. But as soon as they open up it's not a rational overview of the currency and current discussions on the topic, it's a rabid cult that shuns the nonbelievers.
We've been removing "trolls" (defined as anyone critical of bitcoin) for so long and I think it has really led to a one-sided conversation where no one has their beliefs questioned and therefore turns into a cult. 
Yes, fits the definition of a cult, and that really scares me. 
When I first came into Bitcoin (and I was like just someone interested in using digital programmable money. But after two years of moderating every post that comes through this subreddit, I can safely say that it has devolved so much so that it barely resembles what it used to be.
never was *fun*, but for a while it acted a lot more like just trying out new things with this digital currency, playing around with the code, and talking about the possibilities. 
But now it's just a bunch of people who worship numbers in a digital ledger, stare at charts all day, and try to make it rich by hoarding an asset that has no value beyond its use as a near-frictionless digital currency, but since they refuse to use it (because HODL), it's exhibiting the classic signs of a deflationary spiral. 
@_date: 2015-04-06 21:10:02
Hahahahaha I love how any point that is vaguely critical of Bitcoin is immediately written off as a shill "poisoning the well".

First of all, I certainly don't feel like this is a mistake. While I might have a pounding headache from dealing with all the shit that has been thrown at me, I stand by everything I have said and done.
I believe in Bitcoin and I believe in as a community. 
If you see the modlist at I'm a mod in name only. I have no powers there, I can't even distinguish myself as a mod. 
I'll simply remove myself over there once all the dust has settled over here. Again, I was added as a mod there not to exert control/influence, but simply to show how much gets their jimmies rustled *over an internet forum called BUTTCOIN*. 
I have been actively contributing to and moderating this subreddit for 2 years straight, and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. 
I will also continue to provide statistics on the Bitcoin sales from my business. Whether you agree or disagree, considering my data overall is statistically almost the *same* as the data released by Overstock (a difference of just a few tenths of a percentage point) and others, and since I'm still one of the only companies up until this point that releases my Bitcoin sales data, I believe it provides a good insight into the use of Bitcoin in conventional goods and B2B transactions.
Over all, I do hope to see the quality of the posts and discussions to improve here in but I'm not naive enough to think that I'll be able to singlehandedly make that change.
@_date: 2015-04-08 03:32:32
Because I remember when wasn't like this, but it's gotten so rabid and opposed to dissent it's scary. 
We're *losing* users, not gaining users (when measuring our pageview stats), and it's not because of trolls cracking jokes, it's because we've become so insular newcomers who come to ask questions are immediately shot down as "concern trolls".
@_date: 2015-04-07 22:13:14
This exactly. The reason merchants either drop Bitcoin or their employees don't know how to accept it is because there is simply no one using it.
Bitcoin Black Friday 2013 was *amazing*. I know it sounds petty, but when you have Ashton Kutcher tweeting about spending Bitcoin, that's awesome. And businesses that participated reported *massive* sales - like 5-30%, very significant considering today, two years later, Overstock reports ~0.02% of their sales are in BTC.
But then after the bubble burst, everyone was so infatuated with either recouping their losses from buying high or waiting for it to go to the moon and strike it rich, no one was spending it as a currency - the utility which gives Bitcoin its very value.
We need to focus on not *supporting merchants*, but *supporting the economy* by purchasing from Bitcoin accepting merchants.
Often there are posts that say "let's get this new business to accept Bitcoin, if we all ask them then the basic rules of supply and demand will force them to accept it!", but these fail to recognize that "demand" doesn't mean you say "I demand a Bitcoin option", it means people are spending so much Bitcoin that businesses will compete to provide a supply for that demand. 
Back in 2013 companies were fighting to be the first in their industry to accept Bitcoin because there were so many people spending it. 
Nowadays, businesses couldn't care less because they know they'll see 1% *max* in Bitcoin sales in the long term. 
@_date: 2015-04-08 04:44:19

It's not as if I'm going to go to the media with some story about "How I Escaped the Cult of Bitcoin" (if not only because I would like the harassment to stop sometime soon) because I still believe in and use Bitcoin readily.
There was a time when the [positive] sales statistics I posted were written off by because I was "such a part of the community" that my BTC sales were disproportionately large compared to conventional merchants. 
Hell, there's a few threads on making fun of me, and one getting too close to doxxing me than I'm comfortable with.
My business is a recurring joke in along with the alpaca sock guy. I know how it feels to be not only made fun of by them, but actually *stalked* by them.

I feel bad that OP was publicly harangued for making a rational business decision to remove a payment option that was leading to fraud.

And you wonder why calls a cult...
@_date: 2015-04-08 00:18:19
But that's the problem. Bitcoin derives its monetary value from its revolutionary and innovative use as a currency. 
But if no one uses it as a currency, its value plummets, leading to less and less people using it as a currency, leading to a further decline in the price.

Ah, yes, my 5 years of building my current business from the ground up (and over a decade of successful entrepreneurial ventures behind me), two years of accepting Bitcoin, and nearly two years of moderating = no expertise in the subject whatsoever.


If I'm a troll, one of the most vocal Bitcoin-accepting merchants (and one of the only to release their Bitcoin sales data), and a moderator of this subreddit all in one, I guess is screwed!

I ask because those of us who have been in Bitcoin for a while want to have a level headed rational discussion on Bitcoin, not the up! uP! UP! and HODL posts, and all the others that refuse to acknowledge that there are some potential downsides to Bitcoin that are either inherent or that could be improved in the future.
By refusing to even *have* a discussion, by demanding all dissenting viewpoints be removed, and by demanding I be removed as a mod simply because I talk to people who disagree your viewpoint is emblematic of why I say sometimes looks and acts like a cult.

Am I a Buttcoin spy implanted into the modlist from before Buttcoin was even a thing?
Honestly, now I'm just interested. Clearly, in your mind, I am a troll. But if I was a troll, what accounts for the *hundreds* of posts I have made over the years discussing the benefits of Bitcoin? What accounts for my continuing to provide technical assistance to those trying to work on Bitcoin websites? What accounts for my numerous datasets that were propelled to the front page when they portrayed Bitcoin in a positive light?

There are countless reports of businesses adopting bitcoin yet receiving no sales and dropping it.
Wordpress, a *huge* company, dropped Bitcoin because they were getting just a couple orders a week and the hassle to accept it outweighed the profits it generated.
Overstock, one of the largest Bitcoin merchants, reports ~0.02% of their sales in Bitcoin.
It's not about whether or not merchants support Bitcoin, it's whether Bitcoiners support actually using Bitcoin.
Yesterday there was a [post]( on the front page of some guy who found a Bitcoin business. 
One of the [top comments]( asked "Did you spend any Bitcoins there?" and was never answered because the answer is of course no.
Everyone wants merchants to accept Bitcoin, but not many want to spend it once they do.
@_date: 2015-04-06 20:50:10
I didn't just pull that number out of my ass, nor did I look at one month and compare it to another, I've been in business long enough to know a little bit about basic statistical significance. 
I ran an A/B test over 3 months, showing half of my customers the Bitcoin option and the other half no Bitcoin option. For the group that saw no option, I saw a 5.8% increase in revenue.
I just know the what, not the why.
I *have* had people tell me that they wouldn't place an order because I accepted Bitcoin, but I can't say for certain that this is the reason.
It could be the paradox of choice, but again, all I know right now is that when I show my customers a Bitcoin payment option, I get less money.
We can hem and haw as to why that is, but at the end of the day I'm going to do what is most profitable for my business, and unfortunately it looks like that means removing Bitcoin as a prominent payment option.

Thanks for the words of support, it is true that I saw declining revenues from Bitcoin sales, so much so that the cost of accepting Bitcoin is actually now outweighing the revenue from accepting it.
As evidenced by my *years* of previous posts, I'm not some Buttcoin troll, nor am I some guy who had one trade go bad and am now here to shit all over Bitcoin. 
I was (and arguably, still am) very active in Bitcoin, however at the end of the day, I'm a business person, not a cult member. 
I recognize the downsides of Bitcoin, and recognize that it is no where near mass adoption, or even statistically significant adoption (unless you're counting the darknet).
Unfortunately, just simply by making the statement that Bitcoin isn't perfect leads to rabid Bitcoiners to witch hunt me as a "Buttcoin troll". 
HEY PEOPLE: Just because someone doesn't agree with you doesn't make them a troll. Also, if you can't form a counter argument to something someone said, it still doesn't make them a troll. Oh, and please stop reporting "troll" posts - the fact that you think it's necessary to remove simply opposing viewpoints is scary. First they came...
Finally, if this revolutionary, decentralized, p2p currency can be destroyed by people who hang out in a forum in their free time and call themselves "Buttcoiners", we've got bigger problems.

This is why outsiders say looks like a cult.
When someone comes in with a rational question, they aren't curious about something, they're "concern trolling". 
We've got our own terms now to justify why questions about our preconceived notions shouldn't need to be answered.
I remove a *lot* of trolls every single day. But if someone is just asking a question, or if someone isn't immediately supportive of Bitcoin, they're not necessarily trolling.
And the paranoia around here that has led people to believe that every question and every dissenting viewpoint *is* a troll is only food for the trolls at They eat it up when people think there's this giant conspiracy keeping Bitcoin down. There isn't. 
We're our own impediment to growth.

Ok, let's look at Overstock (since Patrick Byrne has been quite open about their Bitcoin sales).
In FY2014 Overstock had $3 million in BTC sales.^[[1]](
In FY2014 Overstock had a total revenue of $1.497 billion.^[[2]](
That means their BTC sales volume was approximately 0.2% compared to 99.8% conventional fiat currency.
EDIT: 


The comment you were replying to was directly referencing data from my business... that accepts Bitcoin... to sell things. I'm not saying Bitcoin isn't used in commerce. I'm saying the proportional volume of Bitcoin purchases is greatly blown out of proportion.
I'm quite active in the Bitcoin world and even my business doesn't break 4% of Bitcoin sales every month. Additionally, as the business continues to grow and fiat sales continue to increase, Bitcoin sales stay nearly stagnant. 
Last year in the month of January Bitcoin sales accounted for ~18% of my sales. This year, the real USD value of Bitcoin sales was nearly identical to last year yet the proportion of BTC/fiat was down to 2%.

Merchant here.
Chargebacks are negligible, if you receive enough chargebacks to even make them statistically significant your card processor will drop you [note: there are "high risk" card processors with much higher rates, but nearly all merchants are conventional boring and not "risky" in the chargeback sense]. 
So we're working with ~3%. If you're using Coinbase or BitPay, they take 1%. So we're down to 2%. 
Figure the merchant had to spend some time (or pay their developer) to integrate Bitcoin payment, train their employees on how to deal with customer service RE bitcoin transactions, and deal with the occasional hiccup in processing (customer sends BTC to address outside of 15 minute window allotted by BitPay? As a merchant they probably don't even know what a public address is and now they have to figure out why the transaction hasn't confirmed).
Now figure the merchant is receiving a *very small* portion of their sales in Bitcoin. For my business, in [FY 2014 only 2% of my gross revenue was in Bitcoin]( This month it's been less than 1%. And I'm pretty active in the Bitcoin world. Other merchants haven't seen a single sale.
So from a conventional merchant's perspective (one who has no ideological or technological investment in Bitcoin), with all the overhead required to accept Bitcoin and the proportionally low amount of sales made with Bitcoin (sometimes so low that the gross revenue from Bitcoin sales is below their ~3% credit card fees), why would they provide a 5% discount when they're only saving 2% on CC fees but have to deal with all the above? We need to work on getting merchants to see the utility of this digital currency, not demand they accept our magic internet money and when they do adopt it, immediately demand that they give us discounts for using it.  
Furthermore, if the merchant is like me and decides to actually integrate the true decentralized p2p nature of Bitcoin and accept it natively in their site, there is not a payment processing fee, but I still have to deal with network fees (for my average order size, it's 0.06%) and conversion to fiat to pay my bills (~1%). So in fees I'm paying about 1.1%. 
But since I accept Bitcoin natively (and hold some BTC for returns, etc), I have to deal with volatility. Had I held all the BTC, a sale made three weeks ago would have provided me with only 2/3 of the real value when I went to pay my bills at the end of the day today.
But either way the merchant is taking on a substantial amount of work and some additional risk to accept Bitcoin - and their sales from Bitcoin are relatively small - to demand that they give you an additional discount for using the same money you just asked them to begin accepting is a bit much to ask.

Alternative Answer (from a merchant):It's a cool device, but considering I only have a couple BTC transactions a month (and all of them being online, never has a Bitcoin customer walked into my shop), I have no incentive to pay for an additional piece of hardware and the time to integrate it into my existing system when my current system - display QR to customer on POS - works flawlessly (at least theoretically, since it hasn't been used for an actual transaction yet).

Hey great to hear from you! 
You're correct in that I do a *lot* of social and economic developmental work with the business, however I do not use Bitcoin for this. I sell my products for Bitcoin, convert the BTC to USD, and then send *that* over in the form of developmental microloans. I actually made a [comment recently]( touching on the benefits of Bitcoin in the developing world and within the field of developmental economics:






And before you say "but when the market does go up, they'll be millionaires!", that's like telling the poor to use their entire paycheck to buy lottery tickets in the hopes of striking it rich.


Bitcoin has a lot of awesome uses, but at this time, store of real-world value is not one of them.
Additionally, a user in the aforementioned thread linked to a great discussion on the use of Bitcoin in developing countries:
I'll copy the tl'dr here:
* Richard Boase visited Kenya for 6 weeks
* He believes that the Bitcoin community only focusses on third world adoption as a means of increasing the value of their holdings, and not because it solves a problem the 3rd world actually experiences. 
* He believes that while Bitcoin solves a problem in the first world, in the third world there's much more pressing issues such as basic infrastructure such as water, sewage, education, internet and electricity. Bitcoin is like learning to run before you can walk.  One of the schools he visited needed a clock, for example. Simple things we take for granted. 
* People in third world nations can't afford to lose half their net worth due to currency fluctuations, whereas here in the first world we generally can. 
* By and large Kenyans use the united states dollar when stability is needed. 
* Due to high import taxes, the £60 tablets he was handing out to the charities were sometimes worth 6 months wages to the people he was handing them to. He believes that it makes more sense to sell the tablet and buy things they need, like a clock. 
* Director of a charity in Kenya said Bitcoin opens up a world of possibility when it comes to fraud, since there's no accountability and no way to confirm that your bitcoins are actually going to the charity. 
* The author thinks we live in ivory towers, and that we don't realise the real problems that face people living in these third world countries. 
* The author went to the post office and asked how much it would cost to send £100 to Kenya via traditional means and the price was £5. And £500 would cost £17. Which is a lot cheaper than any bitcoin related service. 
* He was genuinely moved by the experience and thinks his previous Bitcoin evangelicalism was silly.

Instead of trying to get any and every merchant to accept Bitcoin but then never spending Bitcoin once merchants accept it, seek out those that do and spend your money there.
You want CEOs to be at trade shows talking about how 40% of their sales are in this new Bitcoin currency and how their industry cohorts would be fools not to accept it, not the current situation where CEOs complain about the cultish email brigades they get asking for them to accept Bitcoin and when they finally relent and implement Bitcoin payments they get no sales and the people who pestered them to accept it are never heard from again.

As a manufacturer, why would I deal exclusively in BTC? 
For FY 2014 only 4% of my sales were in BTC. Why would I tell 96% of my customers "no thanks, your legal tender is not accepted here". And inb4 someone says "why would someone buy *your* product with Bitcoin" (a common refrain when business owners talk about the proportionally low number of bitcoin sales they've received), I'm the same guy that posted the graphs of 2013 Bitcoin Black Friday surpassing fiat Black Friday sales by ~30%. I'm the guy that's constantly publishing my BTC sales data. I'm not some fiat shill (hell, I help moderate this very sub). 
Bitcoin needs to be market competitive in a capitalist economy for businesses to see its utility, they aren't going to go out of their way to completely overhaul their processes, accounting, and basic logistical aspects of their supply chain simply to support a fledgeling "currency".
 


Last week, a 1 BTC purchase would provide me with $222. Today, for the same purchase, I would receive $235. Cool, right? Not cool. Manufacturers (and most businesses for that matter) like consistency. We don't want to have to change our prices on a daily basis just so we can cover our costs. 
Oh, and about that 1 BTC order? Had I received the order ~ 3 weeks ago, I would have received ~$300. Which means that if I held that BTC (as a business does with its assets), I would have lost 1/3 of the revenue from that sale. 
I'm all for a BTC economy but we can't be naive and think that if we stick our fingers in our ears the existing economic system will cease to exist.
If a business were to price its goods in BTC how would it pay its suppliers as the value of Bitcoin fluctuates so wildly? Even if *all* the company's suppliers accepted BTC, there still will be fluctuations (this is a free market, after all) as the "real" value of Bitcoin moves to match the "real" value of any other global currency, and vice versa. 
@_date: 2015-02-24 14:53:10
As a merchant who has accepted Bitcoin for two years now I can confirm that there's simply no consumer market as of yet. 
But don't just take my word for it. I just released a full report detailing my sales since accepting Bitcoin, however it didn't paint a [blindly] rosy picture as this fluff piece. Maybe that's why this is on the front page and my report with actual data never made it past /new.

I'm all about minimalist design, I don't want my coveted homepage space to look like a nascar driver, covered in logos from different payment processing companies. 
But even if I did have a huge "Bitcoin accepted here" sticker on my site, my point still stands. All the people who came to my site and demanded I implement Bitcoin (the people who you're saying wouldn't have harassed my CSRs had I had the sticker prominently displayed on the site) never followed through and made a purchase when notified that we did in fact accept it. They never intended to buy anything in Bitcoin, their only intention was to *tell* merchants that they would.


Actually, I had known about Bitcoin for a while, but only dabbled in it. It wasn't until the spring of '13 when it got a good amount of media attention that I began to look into it more seriously. 
Through '13 I don't think I had one proselytizer. It has only gotten bad in the past year or so - possibly as the price tanked, people were trying to pump it back up by boosting the merchant adoption? I don't know, and I'm not going to try to play armchair economist. 


I hope we as a society don't result to being assholes to get our way. Cooperation goes a lot farther than being an annoying asshole (your words, not mine) to those who don't do what you tell them to. But this has been a moderately cordial discussion, so at least we've got that going for us.

What's the point in using a decentralized, trustless currency if the first step is to place your trust in a centralized payment processor?
The businesses that use payment processors aren't accepting Bitcoin, they're accepting USD with a Bitcoin veneer slapped on top. They're accepting Bitcoin for the marketing value of "we accept Bitcoin!", not because they truly want to use a global, immediate, low cost, and decentralized currency.

And this is a kind of chicken-and-egg problem - I currently accept BTC at my Brick &amp; Mortar business but have not trained any of my employees on how to accept Bitcoin. 
Why? I haven't had *one* in-person BTC transaction (all are through our website), so why would I invest my time and money training employees to accept a form of payment that is used so little?
Granted, I've developed a custom Bitcoin sales kiosk that integrates with our existing sales system, but most business owners aren't as proactive about Bitcoin and will just drop it after a couple processing hiccups and few customers using it (like the business owner in OP's post).
The market already has a bunch of Bitcoin POS systems (however competition wouldn't hurt if you're thinking about developing something new!), what we need is greater *consumer* adoption.
If 20% of their potential customers came in asking to pay in "Bitcoin", there would be a reason for them to invest in training their employees on accepting this new currency. But if 0.1% of their potential customers asked to pay in Bitcoin, they wouldn't have any incentive to accept it. 
@_date: 2015-02-23 17:04:11


That is actually pretty close to the point I'm making. I'm a conventional goods manufacturer. I don't make ASICs, I don't sell computer equipment, I don't provide cloudhashing contracts - I manufacture products the general population uses.
So my business provides interesting insight into use of Bitcoin among the general population. 
I've posted my Bitcoin data previously, and long-time subscribers to might remember how for the first 3 months of accepting Bitcoin, it competed heavily with USD (when looking at proportion of gross). There *is* a market of people willing to spend Bitcoin if they *really* see fit. 
The fact that Bitcoin sales have leveled out around 7-10 per month shows that this is basically the market size for conventional businesses for now. Certainly, if you're selling mining hardware, digital goods, or darknet items, your Bitcoin sales will be much higher.
But for conventional businesses, &lt;2% of gross in Bitcoin sales is the current market size. For Overstock, it's 0.02%. My estimation is that by this time next year, my Bitcoin sales will be around 1% (considering the BTC sales are slowly declining while USD sales are quickly rising as the business grows).


This is certainly the case. My adopting Bitcoin (and subsequent holiday sales) correlated well with the late '13 rally and the concerted "Bitcoin Black Friday" marketing effort by the BTC community at large. 
But I think this is a good example of one of the detriments of having a financial tool that is used *both* as a currency *and* as an investment. Those like myself who use it as a currency couldn't really care less about the price as long as it's relatively stable and serves a purpose in the exchange of value. 
But those who see Bitcoin as an investment will *not spend* it if they believe they can make more holding it (as mentioned in the comment chain above), leading to a deflationary trend. 


That's all fine and dandy, but the Bitcoin community should not expect *merchants* to be the ones to take on unnecessary risk for the benefit of *your* investment. 
Merchants are more than willing to take some risk and adopt new technologies if there is consumer demand, but it's naive to think that merchants will adopt Bitcoin, and take a consistent loss from doing so, simply due to the promise of *future* consumer adoption.
There are *numerous* merchants accepting Bitcoin - Newegg, Microsoft, Overstock, Dell, etc - clearly there's not a lack of merchants. If one *truly wanted* to live off Bitcoin, it's actually fairly easy to do. 
There are numerous merchants accepting Bitcoin, there's simply not many spending it.

Within economics there's the ongoing discussion over what's better for an economy - inflation (value of money declining and price of goods therefore increasing), deflation (value of money increasing and price of goods "falling"), none of the above (stagnation), or both of the above (stagflation).
Keynesians believe that moderate inflation will compel individuals to spend their money, funneling money into businesses who then would increase production to meet rising demand, increase employment (need people to work in the factories to make the goods the economy is demanding more and more), and boost economic development. They argue that the steady decline in the value of currency spurs spending and in turn business growth, and on a macroeconomic level, overall economic growth. 
The Friedman camp believes that inflation is detrimental to economic growth and that there should not be an opportunity cost behind simply saving money. The argument that if individuals and businesses are able to save their capital without the risk of marginal losses brought about by inflation, they would then be able to more efficiently and effectively allocate their money to grow their business/personal capital in a way they see fit, outside of the influence of a continually increasing monetary supply (and therefore decreasing monetary value). 
You aren't willing to spend your Bitcoin today because you believe it will be worth more tomorrow. Which is the very argument Keynesians make as to why deflationary economies contract rather than grow. If we all put off purchases because we believe our money will buy twice as much tomorrow as it does today, businesses will have less productive output, leading to economic contraction and a rise in unemployment as no one is spending. As people spend less, businesses have to make less to keep up with demand, and as sales fall so does their need for employment. As unemployment rises, the number of individuals capable of purchasing (whereas previously it was a question of willingness) declines rapidly, further contributing to economic malaise. 
That's the argument, at least.

Unpacking this comment is going to take a bit of work.
-  18% of the sales were from *last* January, about 6 months after I began accepting Bitcoin. When I first started accepting Bitcoin my BTC sales outpaced my fiat sales by nearly 30%. But both real-value *and* proportional BTC sales declined steadily after the initial "we accept Bitcoin" marketing push, and on average Bitcoin sales sit around 2-4%, with a consistent decline of ~0.5-1% per month (but to be fair, that's due *in part* to the growth of the business, where as I stated before, conventional sales are rising while Bitcoin sales are essentially stagnant - actually, slowly falling). And I'm not the only one. In the article I linked above RE Overstock:






-  I *am* complaining about people being pushy about Bitcoin. I've had people literally send over *pages* of their Bitcoin manifesto that reads like it was written by Ted Kaczynski on adderall, harassing my CSRs to implement Bitcoin, and when they say we already accept it, the proselytizer is long gone, flooding other businesses with the same copy-paste "reason" for them to accept Bitcoin. Even worse are the people who rudely tell me that they know how to run my business better than I, and the end-all-be-all solution to all my business' problems is Bitcoin. I'm a supporter of Bitcoin for its utility as a currency, but when people go around telling business owners that it can cut their expenses by 10%, raise their gross revenues by 60%, and cure their cat's cancer, it undermines the *actual* utility of Bitcoin.

I love how the solution to my qualms about people evangelizing Bitcoin is for me to... wait for it... evangelize Bitcoin on my website. I hope you can see the irony in that. 
Also, the way my site is set up, selecting the payment method is the first thing you do after adding items to your cart, before any information is inputted, but I don't fault you for not knowing that as that is the polar opposite of most sites.


When someone opens a support ticket on my site they need to use an email address. My support ticket program ties into my order database and tells me if the person has ever placed an order, and vice versa, whenever an order comes in it will say if that customer has ever had a support ticket. None of the emails that have requested the option came back and utilized it. I can't say that they will *never* intend to purchase something in the future, but I can say that to this date, not one has. But we really can't be basing our arguments on ifs and maybes, can we?


The thread you linked was about a venue putting their customers in mortal danger; what we're talking about here is pestering companies to accept your new money for no reason other than that you asked them to. 
I think we can agree there's a small difference between potentially killing your customers and simply asking them to pay in legal tender.

Right now, that's pretty much the average for conventional goods transactions in Bitcoin.

I've actually seen a *decline* in the number, frequency, and average size of BTC sales and I've been accepting it since '13 (so it's not like I'm looking at a one month sample size or anything).
There just isn't a concerted effort to spend btc and/or support BTC accepting merchants.

Certainly don't want it to sound defeatist, just honest. We can't stick our fingers in our ears when confronted with information we disagree with.


Well for one, Overstock. In FY 2014 Overstock - arguably one of the largest companies accepting Bitcoin - had 0.02% of their sales in Bitcoin. 
For another, Mozilla. They did a full A/B test on the profitability of Bitcoin and came to the conclusion that it was actually *losing* them money.
Now, we can either look at the few companies that *did* release their sales data and call them corporate shills and Buttcoin trolls, but until other merchants open up *their* books, our (Overstock, Mozilla, myself) data is all that's currently available, and considering all our datasets match up almost perfectly, it makes more sense that we're simply being honest rather than the existence of a giant conspiracy of companies accepting Bitcoin then releasing less-than-favorable sales data to undermine the Bitcoin network.
I'm a vocal proponent of Bitcoin merchant adoption, but we can't kid ourselves. There's still a good way to go before this becomes mainstream. 


I'm not impatient. I couldn't care less about the monetary value of Bitcoin, because to me, it has inherent utility simply as an exchange of value.
As for the shortsighted comment, I agree that Bitcoin will completely change the current financial system. But when there's people going from merchant to merchant handing out brochures telling them that if they accept Bitcoin their expenses will decrease by 10% and their potential market will double, it's dishonest and only serves to increase the number of frustrated merchants rather than Bitcoin proponents.
As I said above, I'm an ideological supporter of Bitcoin simply for its utility in business. But we can't get ahead of ourselves and think that we have this huge market advantage when really, we're a sliver of the population, and the demographics that make up Bitcoin users generally do not mix with the consumerist population that businesses generally target. 
Once conventional consumers see the utility of Bitcoin, then we can start flooding the front page with "It's happening!" gifs. But until that time comes, Bitcoin will continue to be a currency mainly used by us internet geeks.

They still follow transactions through wallets. 
I accept BTC for my (100% federally legal) products and have customers send the allotted BTC to a newly-generated public address.
As needed I would then send this BTC from my site to my local wallet and from my local wallet to Coinbase to sell for fiat (and cover my expenses). 
Coinbase somehow noticed this setup and made me fill out a bunch of forms documenting the "business" use of my account.
I have no qualms with giving them my business information, but it was definitely creepy knowing that they're scraping the blockchain and interrogating their customers regarding their transactions, no matter how many degrees of separation.
The only foolproof way is to use a mixer, but I wouldn't be surprised if they begin blacklisting transactions to/from mixers. 
But this is the cost of a 100% legal US-based exchange. Hate the laws? Don't get mad at businesses forced to follow them, get mad at those making them/allowing them to continue - *your* representatives!

Merchants that accept btc natively (without Bitpay or coinbase) clearly know of these companies' existence and have decided to *actually* accept Bitcoin instead of simply accepting USD with a Bitcoin logo pasted on top to give them something to advertise (come buy from us, we accept bitcoin!)
IMO the merchants that actually accept and operate (even just partially) in bitcoin are doing much more for the btc economy and much more to smooth out volatility than those that "accept" Bitcoin through Bitpay or coinbase. 
What's the point of accepting a decentralized trustless currency if the first step is to trust a centralized payment processor?

I've posted many charts depicting my Bitcoin sales data, it's just that the ones that portray Bitcoin in a positive light (like when Bitcoin surpassed USD on Black Friday '13 by 29%) get upvoted to the front page while the ones that aren't shouting "to the moon" (like when I recently posted my long term sales from the day I began accepting it to the current date showing a consistent decline in sales and very low proportional sales) get downvoted to oblivion.
As a merchant I am very interested in the utility of Bitcoin - it does serve a purpose. But as a skeptical, rational, and educated person, I'm the first to say that 90% of the hype here is not rooted in data but rather faith.

Cc processing fees for a company like lionsgate are at/below 1%, and as soon as the number of chargebacks becomes statistically significant any [reputable and fair priced] processor will drop you. Companies are implementing such massive discounts because they know Bitcoiners will "support" their business for about a month until they move on to the next thing that will bring global adoption, and they want to make sure to capture as many bitcoiners as possible in that period of time.

You might be surprised how often you and I hold similar views, it's just that since this is you'll only hear the "RAH RAH TO THE MOON HODL" voices while the generally moderate voices of reason either get downvoted or simply receive no upvotes and flounder (interestingly, the last time I posted data on my business - data that could be viewed a bit more optimistically - it was the top post in the sub for well over a day. This time around it's sitting on page 3 and slowly falling).

But being "as annoying as possible", having people blast their customer service representatives with copypasta "Do you accept Bitcoin" emails, and flooding companies' social media with the same does more harm than good.

I continually release updates on my BTC sales. As of right now it sits around 2-4% of my revenue every month. 
And I'm pretty "active" in bitcoin.
I've also seen a steady decline in sales over the past couple of years. There just aren't many people spending bitcoin. 
What tends to happen is that people go around saying "do you accept bitcoin? If you do I'll support your business if you don't I'll support your competitors." 
So the business owner researches bitcoin, talks to an accountant (honestly, the people saying "taking bitcoin is as easy as copy and pasting a line of code" have never run a business, and certainly not been in an executive position with a board, stakeholders, etc) calls their developer and has them implement it, and trains their employees in how to handle it, and then that first person who said they would spend it is already gone telling your neighbor the same spiel.
Literally twice a month I have someone email my customer support saying "do you accept bitcoin? If you do I will definitely support you!" And then the CSR responds that we've accepted bitcoin for two years now, and the customer is never heard from again.
To a business owner (or frankly anyone who is moderately conscious), these people going around telling businesses to accept Bitcoin have no intention of *spending* Bitcoin, they just want to artificially inflate the perceived utility of their magic internet money. 
I have yet to have someone say "do you accept Bitcoin", have my CSR say "why yes we do!", and have the customer actually make a purchase.

Honestly, no way.
As someone *very* active in the developmental microloan world, I just want to say this is a bad idea.
The people you're trying to target live on less than $1.25 a day. *Horrible* social, economic, and political conditions. Barely living hand to mouth. 
They need our help to prosper, but telling them to convert their hard-earned savings into a highly volatile digital currency is not going to help. Had I provided a BTC-denominated microloan *just two months ago*, it would have lost 1/3 of it's real value. 
That means the people who need the value of their money to stay constant the most, the poor who already live on the margins, will be subject to the wild (and recently, mostly negative) swings of the market.
And before you say "but when the market *does* go up, they'll be millionaires!", that's like telling the poor to use their entire paycheck to buy lottery tickets in the hopes of striking it rich.
Bitcoin has a lot of great uses. I can definitely see Bitcoin be used in the remittance market, but to push it onto the poor as the solution to all their problems is naive to the true nature of Bitcoin.
Bitcoin has a lot of awesome uses, but at this time, store of real-world value is not one of them.

Unfortunately, I'm the only company (so far) willing to release this much data regarding my Bitcoin sales.
Even Bitpay does not talk about gross revenues or even number of transactions per day, they simply mention number of merchants accepting Bitcoin.
Overstock touched on data regarding the first three months of them accepting Bitcoin, however they've been basically silent since then. However since they're publicly traded we'll be able to get to see some more long-term data from them come the end of FY 2015.

That's exactly what I'm getting at - I *don't* hide the fact that I accept Bitcoin. My Bitcoin checkout button is immediately next to and actually *larger* than my PayPal checkout button. 
But the evangelists have no intention of paying with Bitcoin, and they didn't even check to see if I accepted it. They went from my homepage &gt; Contact page, pasted in their pre-written bitcoin request, sent it, and closed the page.
When emailed back saying we do accept Bitcoin (and have done so for ~ two years now), they never returned to make a purchase.

Please don't brigade their customer service representatives with copypasta requests to accept Bitcoin, *especially if you have no intention of actually using their service should they begin to accept Bitcoin*.
Too many merchants have complained that they receive 500 requests to accept Bitcoin, and when they finally accede to "market demand" and begin accepting BTC, they receive one sale.
If you want to spend your BTC at Lyft, ask them! But don't go around to every merchant yelling TAKE BITCOIN TAKE BITCOIN if you don't intend to spend your BTC once they start accepting it.
Because then it's worse than if they hadn't accepted it in the first place. Before, they were skeptical but indifferent about Bitcoin. After, they are adamantly against it as they realize they implemented an entirely new currency not because there is market demand for its use, but because someone wanted to artificially increase the value of their magic internet money.

Miners don't just produce bitcoins, they also act as the network of payment processors for bitcoins. So while Visa, Discover, etc have huge server farms to process payments, bitcoin transactions are processed by individual miners (or more often mining pools) who then receive the fee for that particular transaction.

Okay now that is an interesting argument and I do have to admit I have never thought of BTC being both a currency and a security. 
My point is mainly that businesses will be reluctant to even venture into the bit waters if all they see is a wildly fluctuating market with no [apparent] rhyme or reason. 
I would love to buy my raw materials in BTC (with my suppliers around the globe, a lot of time is spent just waiting for checks/cards to be authed, cleared, etc) and have even asked my (very large) suppliers to accept it, however their response is always "market volatility makes it impossible for us to ensure we are properly compensated for our products".

Agreed. For the few orders I've had that lagged in posting to the blockchain I was forced to manually recheck every hour or so before it eventually showed up. As you said, it's much easier for me to sit in my office and wait for it to post as compared to a B&amp;M merchant who would have to sit awkwardly and wait until it showed up.
The issue with coinbase really blows. I mean, the whole allure of BTC is the instant transfer of funds. The fact that coinbase isn't facilitating that (whereas CampBX, even with their horrendous servers, could do so) makes it difficult and even unfeasible for businesses to adopt BTC. Every business owner who I try to turn onto BTC is always amazed at the idea of *instant* money. Not two weeks, not a week, not three days, but *instant*. 
If coinbase cannot keep up with the transaction volume I suspect many businesses who are less ideologically-tied to BTC will simply chose to revert to fiat transactions. We need to show business BTC is in their best interests. 
@_date: 2013-07-29 21:42:03
Bitcoins are the antithesis of a global currency with central control. Yes, bitcoin is a global currency. But the decentralized aspect of mining and transaction processing prevents one state (or any authority for that matter) from taking control and manipulating it. The only real threat would be a 51% attack but as soon as that happened the blockchain would fork and the offending party would be left with what amounts to monopoly money.

    }

I have a pre-generated list of receiving addresses and I just import them into the site as they are depleted.
If you want to accept BTC and immediately cash out, then BitPay is the way to go. One percent is nothing compared to what others charge (amazon is 15%!). But if you want to develop a BTC economy rather than piggyback on BTCs success, then keeping actual BTC is the way to go. It will prompt the businesses to pursue a more stable exchange that will lead to consistent and steady growth rather than short term booms and busts.
I cash out about 80% to cover COGS, overhead, labor, etc. The rest I keep in BTC. I'm hoping more of my vendors will start accepting BTC so I have to exchange less and less.

Don't feel bad. You'll generally get downvoted when talking about bitcoin outside of It's somewhat frustrating, but it is what it is.
What I just *love* is when someone in or asks about payment options for their new business and I (being in business for a few years, using all major payment options) get downvoted for mentioning bitcoin. 
I guess people just want to stick with the status quo and have a portion of their hard-earned money taken by a company that does basically nothing.
I mean, back in 1980, to send information (a letter), one would expect to pay for a stamp. Now with email, paying to send information is seen as asinine. Yet we are completely content with paying to send money, even if it's just to the guy next to me when we split the bill at a restaurant.

Their value will only continue to rise if we actually *use* bitcoins.

The value of bitcoin is dertermined *solely* by their utility to the market. If they are never are used they will lose all value.

You need to talk to a CPA. NOW. 
You need to file as a 501(c)3 if you want to call yourself a NPO. You have to file with the state and federal government, as you will be collecting money (bitcoin included; all income made with btc is taxed just like cash) under the guise of charity. You need to document exactly how you use the money you collect otherwise it will be taxed as income. 
You can form as a PMB and then operate as a charity but you will have to prove your intentions to donors through transparency. 
Either way, you have to declare the income you make through bitcoin or your charity will be shut down by the government. Like it or not, that's how it is. 
If you haven't started a charity (or business) before, you should definitely talk to an accountant lest you get fucked by the IRS.

This sums up how I mentally compare BTC to other alt-coins


Basically BTC was the first truly widespread online cryptocurrency. Sure there was e-gold and the like, but BTC was the first to really *take off*. Following the rise of BTC, developers and business people began to create their own BTC-esque clones with the hopes of *that* currency taking off as well.
So while other alt-coins have *some* value (such as Litecoins' quicker transaction time and smaller computing load), they won't ever surpass the value provided by BTC simply because of its comparable usage.

Stable? [Not necessarily]( It's brand new and is still finding its equilibrium. We've seen spikes and drops, where it goes is anyone's guess. Obviously with wider adoption the value will rise, but where it goes it all speculation. 
Wise investment? Your guess is as good as mine. Rule  is don't invest more than you're willing to lose.

If you want total control of your private keys you have to set up your own processor. That could entail running a full node of bitcoind, however I simply use a DB with pubkeys to be completely sure my keys are separate from my site. Setting up your own handrolled processor will take some time, but once it's up it will basically run itself. 
The most basic BTC implementation needs only 
1) a receiving address 
2) a calculation of the current exchange rate 
3) a way to determine whether the BTC was received. That's it. 
You can see how I do it on my site (google my name). Like I said, it's super easy to do. I just have a DB of receiving addresses, and display one when the customer checks out. 
I then calculate the coinbase exchange rate (that's where I sell so that's where I calculate my rate) every twenty minutes, cache the rate, and display that to the customer (the caching is to protect myself from sudden rises/drops in price, as well as to provide a single amount to the customer upon checkout - otherwise, they may reload the page only to find the price changed due to a fluctuating exchange rate). 
All the while I am checking that receiving address for funds with a websocket to real-time blockchain data. As soon as the transaction is sent I process the transaction and load the "Thank you" page. All of this is automatic and it took me about three days to implement from idea to working system. 
Then, when I'm ready to receive my fiat, I just log into coinbase and sell the coins I received that day, and the fiat is deposited into my account in 1 business day. Now I have the peace of mind knowing I'm the only one who controls my money. If an exchange suddenly goes under I'm still protected because the only one with access to my keys is me.
Conversely, you can use a third party processor such as bitpay. Bitpay and coinbase are like paypal - they give you a code snippet you put on your site and they do all the hard work for you. The downside there is that they take a portion (1%) and they control your privkeys.

Merchant here.
Chargebacks are negligible, if you receive enough chargebacks to even make them statistically significant your card processor will drop you [note: there are "high risk" card processors with much higher rates, but nearly all merchants are conventional boring and not "risky" in the chargeback sense]. 
So we're working with ~3%. If you're using Coinbase or BitPay, they take 1%. So we're down to 2%. 
Figure the merchant had to spend some time (or pay their developer) to integrate Bitcoin payment, train their employees on how to deal with customer service RE bitcoin transactions, and deal with the occasional hiccup in processing (customer sends BTC to address outside of 15 minute window allotted by BitPay? As a merchant they probably don't even know what a public address is and now they have to figure out why the transaction hasn't confirmed).
Now figure the merchant is receiving a *very small* portion of their sales in Bitcoin. For my business, in FY 2014 only 4% of my gross revenue was in Bitcoin. And I'm pretty active in the Bitcoin world. Other merchants haven't seen a single sale.
So from a conventional merchant's perspective (one who has no ideological or technological investment in Bitcoin), with all the overhead required to accept Bitcoin and the proportionally low amount of sales made with Bitcoin (sometimes so low that the gross revenue from Bitcoin sales is below their ~3% credit card fees), why would they provide a 3.5% discount when they're only saving 2% on CC fees but have to deal with all the above? We need to work on getting merchants to see the utility of this digital currency, not demand they accept our magic internet money and when they do adopt it, immediately demand that they give us discounts for using it.  
Furthermore, if the merchant is like me and decides to actually integrate the true decentralized trustless nature of Bitcoin and accept it natively in their site, there is not a payment processing fee, but I still have to deal with network fees (for my average order size, it's 0.06%) and conversion to fiat to pay my bills (~1%). So in fees I'm paying about 1.1%. 
But since I accept Bitcoin natively (and hold some BTC for returns, etc), I have to deal with volatility. Had I held all the BTC, a sale made three weeks ago would have provided me with only 2/3 of the real value when I went to pay my bills at the end of the day today.
But either way the merchant is taking on a substantial amount of work and some additional risk to accept Bitcoin - and their sales from Bitcoin are relatively small - to demand that they give you an additional discount for using the same money you just asked them to begin accepting is a bit much to ask.

I have my own handrolled BTC setup explicitly so I *don't* have to give my money to bitpay or coinbase. 
That was the whole point of bitcoin, right? To take financial power out of the hands of corporations who do nothing but profit off *our* labor? *Our* money? Now that we've finally got the groundwork laid and the scaffolding built, why would we give it all away to a private corporation whose only interest is to profit by taking your money and handing it to me?
Kind of defeats the whole purpose if you ask me.

Credit card companies and PayPal charge me 2.9% +$0.30USD whereas the only fees associated with Bitcoin are exchange fees (I don't use bitpay but rather accept BTC directly so my fees are less than those who use a third-party integration). So when I sell my BTC I'm charged (on average) 1-1.5% depending on the exchange I use. 
As for a CC fluctuating rate, the 2.9%+$0.30 is written into the contract so they can't really change that, however some processors do charge to process refunds meaning if you decide to cancel your order, the merchant still pays the processing fees on money they never received.

Exactly! BTC makes political borders irrelevant, geographic barriers nonexistent, and sheer distance not important. The process of buying a product with BTC is exponentially easier than the same with a credit card, and as a business, receipt of the funds is nearly instantaneous- no waiting over a week for the Credit Card charges to be deposited in my account.
Once more businesses start accepting BTC I will be able to keep more of my assets in my wallet rather than exchanging them for fiat. If my suppliers start accepting BTC then I will be able to begin pricing my products in BTC (stabilization through widespread usage) rather than constantly calculating the exchange rate every time a customer checks out.
When the market shoots up of crashes down people stop spending. They're unsure of where it will go and so they just contract. That only allows speculators to have *greater* control of the market which exacerbates the trend until the bubble pops. I mean right now BTC looks like the currency of Zimbabwe. If you go to checkout on my website you will be given an amount in BTC to send. But wait a few minutes and refresh the page, and you'll get a different rate. This uncertainty causes a reduction in spending (why buy a product for 5BTC when it will be worth 2.5BTC tomorrow; vice versa, why buy a product for 5BTC today when tomorrow it would be 10BTC and then possibly back to 4?). I haven't had a single BTC order since Sunday when we started this roller coaster ride, and I don't foresee any future orders until the price levels out. 
People who hold BTC right now have no incentive to spend if the value keeps climbing. But once it peaks those of us whole use BTC as a currency and not a security will be the ones who take the hit while the get-rich-quick guys jump out at the top. It's cyclic. Every time we have a big boom and a big bust. Bigger boom and bigger bust. Massive boom and equally massive bust. And every time the people getting rich are the ones who make money off us 'honest joes' who just try to eke out a living through the sales of tangible goods/services.

I run a social business that does just that! The idea behind social business is that since charities are entirely dependent on donations, if you give a social cause a way to generate revenue then it won't have to always be begging for money (donors donate less when the economy is down, and that's unfortunately the time the poor need the most help). This frees up time and resources so the organization can focus on creating larger and larger social value.

The whole point of BTC is decentralization. You're a customer and I'm a business. You want to buy something and I want to sell. BTC was created so we don't have to rely on - or be robbed by - credit card companies or financial institutions.
And now we're begging arguably one of the most exploitative financial institutions to come and take part of our economy and sell it back to us?

I unfortunately discontinued the wicks about a year ago. I continued to sell them until I ran out of supplies, and then I was forced to pull them for good. :/
Big ad networks [blocked me for "drug content"]( so to appease them I 1)created a subsidiary business for the wicks, 2)moved the product to an alternate site, 3)distanced the brands from each other, and 4)completely changed the site/social media presence to fit their desires.
[Still, they blocked me]( from advertising my *quite legitimate* business. It's weird. They allow ads for bongs, pipes, grow products, and the like, but my soap is deemed to be socially destructive, and therefore I am blocked from showing it to the world.
So in a final drastic move I completely pulled the wicks. I figured it was a "chop off a limb to save the body" type of deal. Even with this, [they did not budge]( By this time I was ready to just give up and go back to making hemp wicks alongside my skin care and just forget about advertising (something that is integral to growing a brand), but I had already completely stopped manufacturing the product and other entrepreneurs came in to fill the market void. 
I figured that a good time to reevaluate the business' direction and decided to focus wholly on skin care.

Huge corporations such as BB are reluctant to implement an untested and highly volatile currency. Small businesses however are more willing to take the risk so that they could reap the rewards of the Bitcoin economy.

Basically, yeah. I use it on my checkout page so as soon as the customer sends payment I dynamically load the payment confirmation page so they don't have to send payment then click a "confirm order/check receiving address" button.

I'm really glad to see them focusing on the charitable aspect of Bitcoin and the social nature of the community as a whole. 
Too often we hear about SR and DPR, with the media (and in turn, the general population) completely ignoring the fact that many of us use BTC as a tool to *promote* social and economic development. Bitcoin makes social contributions more efficient, more targeted, and therefore more effective.

Well I had known about bitcoins well before starting but was unsure of whether I should integrate. About two weeks ago I finally decided to do so and it has been awesome. Sales definitely decline when the market shifts significantly, but when things smooth out it's really cool to process payments with BTC rather than credit cards or paypal. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 18:58:50
There's no such thing as a free lunch. The cost of Amazon accepting Bitcoin is the fact that hundreds of BTC-accepting small businesses will be cannibalized by Amazon and their massive market share that was achieved through undercutting retailers and selling at a loss until their competition goes out of business then jacking up the prices however they see fit.

Do you still have the mistyped address? 
@_date: 2013-08-08 15:19:33
Here's how I have my site setup to accept BTC payments:
The most basic BTC implementation needs only 1) a receiving address 2) a calculation of the current exchange rate 3) a way to determine whether the BTC was received. That's it. You can see how I do it on my site (google my name). Like I said, it's super easy to do. I just have a DB of receiving addresses, and display one when the customer checks out. I then calculate the coinbase exchange rate (that's where I sell so that's where I calculate my rate) every twenty minutes, cache the rate, and display that to the customer (the caching is to protect myself from sudden rises/drops in price, as well as to provide a single amount to the customer upon checkout - otherwise, they may reload the page only to find the price changed due to a fluctuating exchange rate). All the while I am checking that receiving address for funds with a simple jQuery call. As soon as the transaction is sent I process the transaction and load the "Thank you" page. All of this is automatic and it took me about three days to implement from idea to working system. Then, when I'm ready to receive my fiat, I just log into coinbase and sell the coins I received that day, and the fiat is deposited into my account in 1 business day. Now I have the peace of mind knowing I'm the only one who controls my money. If an exchange suddenly goes under I'm still protected because the only one with access to my keys is me.

Well also they have less reason to shut it down. Right now they're using money-exchanging laws to thwart us. But if we're exchanging bitcoins for goods and services they can do nothing about it. Their money isn't involved at all.

Just a FYI, a lot of the stuff you buy from Amazon isn't actually sold by Amazon. They just developed a system that works like eBay but appears (to the customer) as a purchase from a single entity. 
When you make a purchase on Amazon the order is split up and diverted to individual merchants who then fulfill it through their own systems.
Oh, and Amazon takes 15%, forcing many merchants to mark up the product even more.
@_date: 2013-07-10 13:50:20
This is just my humble opinion, but in my BTC-related interactions I've found everyone's favorite response is "but money laundering and drugs!!1!!"
Rather than try to convince them of how cash is used for that same function now without everyone getting up in arms, I've instead focused on the practical real world applications. You can buy everything you need with btc. Electronics, food, consumer goods, etc. It's its own small economy and for the most part everything you need is already available, you just have to do some research to find businesses that accept it.

Four bars (16oz) is $16.
Four bars and a jar of lotion (22oz total): $20.
Ten bars (40oz): $27.
Fifteen bars (60oz): $35.
That's why I do flat rate shipping. It may look like a big number, but in the end, you'll be saving $$ :)

Bitcoin is a P2P digital currency that allows people to freely exchange value around the world instantly. Unlike wire transfers/Western Union/Visa/etc which charge 3-15%, bitcoin transactions have fees less than 1% - and that's voluntary.
Additionally, it's truly *instantaneous*. Say someone sends you money through PayPal. While that money is displayed in your account, you won't have access to it for 2-3 business days. Bitcoin transactions happen immediately, meaning if someone sends you money - even if you're in Timbuktu - you can turn around and use it immediately.
The bitcoin bot is a bot that facilitates bitcoin transactions between reddit users. Users can "tip" each other and the bot will send the bitcoins to a unique bitcoin address associated with your username. 
@_date: 2013-08-06 00:51:21
Darn. I wanted to see whether it was a legitimate private key (by sending a nominal about of BTC to the associated public key) or whether it was just a non-existent number.

@_date: 2013-07-29 17:00:08
I just sell my bitcoins on CampBx and/or coinbase for USD. But as said below, if you don't actually want to handle bitcoins you can just contract that out to bitpay and have them do all the grunt work for you.
@_date: 2013-04-03 16:22:44
That's another thing I have a question about.
I've *never* had a chargeback, and the only time I've had to process a refund was when the customer accidentally ordered the wrong item (it pays to keep your customers happy! But I digress...)
The whole payment fraud thing is a little confusing to me (again, I'm looking at all of this from a traditional standpoint... I kind of feel like my dad when I was trying to show him how to work a computer...). So is there no chance of fraud simply because when someone makes a purchase you know for a fact they own the BTCs? Hypothetically, couldn't someone steal someone else's BTCs and then make a purchase with them, similar to cash? Or is the whole payment fraud assurance simply because there is no avenue to contest a charge?
I guess what I'm trying to say is why exactly is there not a chance of payment fraud? What makes BTC more secure? 
I'm really sorry if this is all common knowledge, but I'd like to wrap my head around all of this so I can understand what I'm doing haha.
@_date: 2013-08-27 19:56:09
When I first started I used them and had no issues whatsoever. Granted, this was for BTC-&gt;fiat so I can't attest to their BTC purchasing flow, but from my experience they were pretty good. I have since migrated to coinbase simply because orders go through immediately and transfers happen 1-2 days quicker. But all in all, CampBX has served me well.
@_date: 2013-08-09 22:26:59
Actually from what I've seen when the price goes up in the short term, people stop spending BTC and use fiat because they think "Why spend 0.5 BTC today when it will be worth 25% more tomorrow?" When the price starts to fall I see a rise in BTC orders, and when the price stabilizes so do BTC orders. This obviously doesn't account for the fact that with a higher price would come wider adoption and therefore a broader use (lessening the tangible impact of a fluctuating exchange; similar to how QE doesn't have a visible effect within the US but when looking on a macro level its effects are much more apparent), but humans are behavioural thinkers and when prices rise they tend to hoard more.

How does this work from a merchant's POV? I sell on amazon (obviously they won't let me accept BTC directly, so my BTC shop is on my website) but I'm interested in how this would work for "traditional" merchants. Do you just buy the item yourselves with fiat and input the user's info at checkout? Either way, this is pretty cool!

WOOP WOOP! 
I have a homebrew setup; I didn't want to run bitcoind for fear of someone trying to hack the site and get my private keys so I have it set up where I import public keys to a DB and then display a new key to each visitor. That way all my BTC are kept in my bitcoin-qt and completely separate from the publicly-facing website. Call me paranoid, but I'd rather be safe than sorry hahaha. 
@_date: 2013-08-23 14:02:15
I've updated the site so that is no longer the process. 
Also, The state of the form field played no role in submission. I had coded it so it can't submit without info because it is validated before submission and the validation would throw a "please fill out x form" error. Only when your info is saved *and* btc is received will it validate and submit. Otherwise it would validate, throw an error, and switch to manual submission, waiting for the relevant info. I've thought through the whole process. 
@_date: 2013-08-13 22:40:05
Exactly. I use the coinbase price on my site, it's much closer to the "real" market price.
@_date: 2013-04-15 23:38:05
I don't. I believe in the bitconomy and actively try to purchase raw materials, office supplies, capital equipment, etc with BTC. The only way it will become widely accepted is if businesses begin to adopt it similar to checks, credit cards, gift cards, etc. The only reason any of those forms of payments are accepted beyond cash is that the business knows they can be reimbursed for the face value of their transaction. If we can prove to businesses that bitcoins *do* have an inherent value, we will begin to see their use expand.

- Are contributions made immediately upon purchase, every week, every month, every quarter, etc? 
- Will you be making the extent of your charitable contributions publicly available?
@_date: 2013-07-22 15:07:46
I'm not sure about how OP handles it (and me being online does change the scenario a bit) but what I do is have the website check the (unconfirmed) balance of the receiving address on checkout. If there happens to be an error (such as a network lag, low tx-fee-induced lag, etc) the site will allow the customer to continue checkout but then will notify me in my admin panel that the payment is unconfirmed. I then would just manually check to ensure the coins made their way into my wallet before sending the order out. I have only had a couple payments lag like this as most go through immediately.

True. There is still the possibility for a scam, but the nature of a capitalist system would (as you said) mean if you scam someone *one time* as a business your whole reputation- your name, brand, customer base - would be destroyed and a more legitimate business would take your place. 
As a business you have NO INCENTIVE to scam someone. The customer, on the other hand, has ALL incentive to scam a business. They have absolutely nothing to lose. All payment processors (and the internet personal army) always side with customers in these disputes (as we have seen time and time again with PayPal and the like, the violin story comes to mind). 
If ABC, Inc. scams Joe Smith, Joe can go to Yelp, reddit, BBB, Angie's List, the like and tell his story. Consumer Reports would jump on it and ABC would be dust. But if *Joe scams ABC* there is no recourse. ABC cannot go to Consumer Reports and say "Hey! Joe Smith scammed me!" Not only is this highly unprofessional, it is a violation of customer privacy. So while Joe is going around to all these businesses scamming them, nothing can be done. 
Now, I am in no way saying all businesses are honest. There are most definitely some nefarious business owners out there. But as the victim of chargeback fraud I can attest to the fact that there are *no* protections for the seller. Even with proof of delivery, the onus is on the seller to prove themselves to be honest. I guess what I'm trying to say is that businesses have NO reason to scam customers and this idea that all business owners would wipe out your checking account if not stopped fails to address the fact that just one instance of doing so would destroy their business and everything they've spent their lives developing. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 16:12:40
Small businesses have much more of a vested interest in maintaining the connection with each individual customer. If you've ordered from me before and subsequently come back, I'll know even before pulling you up in the system just by your name. With regular customers, first name basis is a given. Unlike big box stores which couldn't care less about "outlier" or "marginal" customers, each and every person who walks into a small business is treated like the  customer, even if it's just to buy a $0.05 piece of Bazooka gum.

1- more secure. No email/password combo. One time address that can basically not be traced. 
2- faster and easier. No dealing with long forms or verifications. One click, payment sent. Businesses like it because it's like getting cash instantly. I have to wait a week for CC charges to clear and 4 days for PayPal, but BTC is nearly instantaneous.
3- Decentralized. No worrying whether PP will lock your account and take your funds. What's yours is yours. In this vein, businesses have more say and control in how they receive their funds. 
4- so many more, but I have to get to work! ;)

As for processing time (and coming from a business standpoint) it's really interesting to see the voluntary fees. I mean, my CC processor, PayPal, Amazon, etc all take exorbitant fees. But with BTC they're *voluntary*. Lest I sound too optimistic, but it looks like there may be something big here.

You're going to need a bank account. You can go with an integration parter like coinbase or BitPay, or you can develop your own processor. Bitcoins are super easy to accept and if you're developing a website you'll be more than able to create a BTC processor.
The most basic BTC implementation needs only
1) a receiving address
2) a calculation of the current exchange rate
3) a way to determine whether the BTC was received.
That's it. You can see how I do it on my site (google my name).
Like I said, it's super easy to do. I just have a DB of receiving addresses, and display one when the customer checks out. I then calculate the coinbase exchange rate (that's where I sell so that's where I calculate my rate) every twenty minutes, cache the rate, and display that to the customer (the caching is to protect myself from sudden rises/drops in price, as well as to provide a single amount to the customer upon checkout - otherwise, they may reload the page only to find the price changed due to a fluctuating exchange rate). All the while I am checking that receiving address for funds with a simple jQuery call. As soon as the transaction is sent I process the transaction and load the "Thank you" page. All of this is automatic and it took me about three days to implement from idea to working system. Then, when I'm ready to receive my fiat, I just log into coinbase and sell the coins I received that day, and the fiat is deposited into my account in 1 business day.

The first exchange is MtGox. People come into bitcoin thinking it's like fiat - $1 here is $1 there. They aren't aware that it is a free market with differing exchange rates. So if they google "what is BTC/how do I get BTC/how do I sell BTC", the common refrain is MtGox. 
And it's not made any better by the fact that gox still claims to control 80% of the market. An unassuming visitor will believe that statement and will go through gox thinking they're getting the best deal because it's the "largest exchange".
I'm not disagreeing with your statement that there are smart newbies. Of course there are. But for people who see a bitcointip comment in AskReddit, they aren't necessarily well-versed in finance and will feel burned by bitcoin when they go to buy something and realize their money is instantly worth 10% less simply because of the exchange from which they purchased.
@_date: 2013-08-23 03:25:59
Hahah we have to start somewhere! I figure the more everyday goods we can buy in BTC, the closer we get! Soap it just the beginning, but then food, gas, bills; the more it is used in conventional transactions, the more it will become commonplace and the less we need to convert to fiat. Once we can buy all our goods in bitcoin, the private banking industry will no longer control our finances.

@_date: 2013-04-29 13:21:56
What? No. I'm a big proponent of bitcoins as a currency. Anyway, how would I benefit if it fails? I accept BTC and have money in BTC. If the currency fails I'm out a significant amount of money. 
And that's why I say what I do: if we want it to 'take off' we have to accept there are *some* short comings. Namely the fact that it's so volatile I cannot pay my employees in BTC without them fearful of losing money. 
I could sit here and parrot the 'Bitcoin will topple world governments and cure cancer' type of thing but I consider myself a rational person. There are some flaws. And unless we address them we won't see wide acceptance. 
It's easy for you to say you would like to be paid in bitcoins. You already use them. But for a business like myself, we can't just call a company meeting and say "you pay is now converted to BTC. If the value fluctuates, so be it." 
People still want to be paid in fiat. And with current labor laws, paying someone in anything else besides tangible currency would be illegal.

There were a few reasons: 
1) I started making skin care products and they *took off*. I was constantly unable to keep up with demand so I decided to pare down my product line to focus on what had the highest demand. 
2) With the rise of low-priced vapes like the MFLB and countless pen products, I saw the writing on the wall: wicks were waning in popularity.
3) [and this is the big one] I want Wholly Hemp to be a model for socially responsible businesses. I'm educated in the social business theory of Muhammad Yunus and one of the first tenets of a social business is that it does not contribute to or promote anything that can do any harm whatsoever. So selling smoking accessories is basically the company tacitly endorsing the harmful habit of smoking. I figured it better for myself, my brand, and the world if I focused all my energy on super-effective skin care products, that way people are more likely to talk about the brand and its social mission rather than hide the fact that they purchase from a "head shop".

It allows you to transfer money around the globe *instantly* with essentially no fees. Bitcoin can seriously change the way small (and large) businesses operate. When someone sends me a payment I know my money is already in my wallet (no waiting over a week for my money like with traditional payment processors), and there's no more 3% fees. Additionally, it has broadened my market reach beyond my national borders, and BTC orders tend to be from around the globe, allowing me to "spread my wings" business-wise.
It just makes everything so much easier. The biggest thing for me (and probably any other small business) is the fact that it is immediate. I just had a huge wholesale order go out yesterday. While the customer paid in full and I sent out the product immediately, I will not see that money for over a week. So now I'm stuck in business limbo - no inventory to sell, no money to purchase raw materials to make more inventory. Bitcoin makes that problem a thing of the past. If I got 50 bitcoin orders right now it wouldn't be a problem. As they are coming in I could easily buy supplies as necessary.
As a business a lot of my money is tied up by payment processors who make interest off *my* money while *charging me* the whole time. It's just common sense that I would want to have greater control of my own money while at the same time operating in the global marketplace. With fiat you either operate locally in cash or bow to the demands of payment processors who will allow you to sell to a wider market but will charge you as I said before. With bitcoin you can operate globally *and* have complete control of your money.

I could go on and on with the comparative benefits of Bitcoins over PayPal.
It can *literally* change the way global business is conducted. 
I started accepting Bitcoins just two weeks ago and I've been inundated with orders. Speaking of, if you ordered from me and haven't received a shipping confirmation yet, do not fret! completely wiped out a significant portion of my inventory and I just got off the phone with my supplier who notified me that my raw materials should be here soon! For those waiting you will receive some extra goodies for the wait, and I have since increased the amount of raw materials on hand to ensure this problem does not arise again :)

If I did write custom software I would love to share it (open source FTW!), however all I did was write a small javascript function that checks the current exchange rate then calculates the customer's total using their dollar total. I have an array of receiving addresses and when the customer checks out they are provided with a unique address to send the BTC. Once I receive the BTC their order is confirmed, inputted into the system, and sent.
The most difficult part (and this is speaking relatively, as everything with BTC is so damn smooth and easy) is exchanging these BTC for USD. Since most of my vendors won't accept BTC (but I still want to help develop and stabilize the BTC economy), I keep a set amount of assets in BTC in my wallet and exchange it so that I receive the exact amount I would have if I just used USD. If I sell low it will contribute to market decline and if I sell high it would only serve to falsely inflate BTC, so I try to do a straight across exchange. Once BTC begins to stabilize I will hold more and more assets directly in BTC as I truly believe this currency could help small businesses exponentially.

Rather than buying coins for cash I earn all of mine through selling phsyical products on my website.

Agreed. Even the article states how Amazon supports it, even though they opposed a very similar law here in CA. Why? Because the law in CA would affect their bottom line so they fought tooth and nail. But a law that burdens small businesses with collecting and reporting sales tax for every locale in which a sale is made? THAT'S PERFECT! 
Think about it. Amazon has the infrastructure and the margins to do this. But smaller businesses will simply throw their hands in the air and take their shops offline. Want to buy something off the web? Amazon will be the only way. But it's okay little guy, Amazon allows you to sell your product through their *perfect* sales channel! And they *only take 15%, how generous of them*.

They're still wary because of the market instability and are unwilling to use bitpay; they want a currency that they can hold and *use*, not immediately dump for fiat.

Put yourself in the shoes of a small business owner. You know nothing of decentralized crypto-currencies. Some guy comes and says "you need to start accepting this new currency. No one recognizes it except me and some people on the internet. It works great, except its value fluctuates over 50% a day. But besides that, it's awesome. And anyway, there's a business that will mitigate that risk by immediately giving you USD and they just take 1%"
So uh why don't I just use USD? PayPal has been around for years, is trusted, and takes only 2% more. And they don't do all this *confusing internet stuff* converting "real" money into monopoly money, sending it to me in a random string of characters, and then converting it back into "real" money. 
And then when you add the fact that every time they google BTC all they read is articles about stolen wallets, hackers, DDoS, and huge fluctuations, businesses have very little incentive [again, from their perspective] to accept BTC. 
Let me put it this way. With all the perceived negatives of BTC, why go out of my way to contract a third party business solely in place to "protect" me from fluctuations just to get USD when I could much more simply use the trusted paypal/google wallet? 
**Again, I'm simply explaining this through *their* eyes. If you look at my post history you'll see I'm a big proponent of BTC as a global decentralized currency. It has huge potential, but we can't turn a blind eye to its obvious [current]* downsides.**
*Current as in at this moment. Tomorrow things could change. But for the time being, these are some of the perceived downsides cited by businesses preventing them from using BTC.

Not all merchants are using Coinbase/Bitpay so you will not get an accurate proportion. I'm a conventional goods merchant (not SR) and I accept BTC directly, and I'm guessing many other BTC merchants do the same.

I completely agree. Not only does it make companies wary of accepting bitcoins, no one purchases when the market is fluctuating. 
Everyone is going to say "Bitpay fixes that problem" but it doesn't address the underlying issue of a highly volatile currency. Bitpay is just like PayPal only for bitcoins. The point of bitcoins was decentralized transactions based on a crypto currency, why route all payments though another processor? Plus, businesses still worry about the volatility even if they are 'protected' by bitpay. Volatility is a signal of a weak and (to many, untrusted) market. Even if they can convert to fiat, most are still are wary of accepting it in the first place. Additionally, bitpay doesn't actually allow merchants to *operate* in the bitcoin economy. They have *no incentive* to further the bitcoin economy. It's when people and business have an individual vested interest in something (in this case, the bitcoin economy) will they actively work to better it. 
When businesses start accepting bitcoins directly and not immediately converting them to fiat we will see some stabilization. But businesses will not do that *until* the userbase makes a proactive decision to intice business with a vibrant and [moderately] stable economy. 
@_date: 2013-08-05 23:26:00

But our suppliers won't adopt BTC as an option until the market stabilizes and they can ensure their assets won't be wiped out overnight. 
BTC users want merchants to accept it, BTC merchants want their suppliers to accept it, but our suppliers look at the charts and ask "where is the incentive to accept a currency which we don't even know will exist tomorrow morning?"
I would much rather use BTC solely over USD or even a combination of the two. BTC makes global business truly possible. But businesses are quick to point out they can't justify to their investors dropping a significant amount of capital, labor, and raw materials into [what appears to them to be] an untested market only known for extreme fluctuations and no relative stability.
If I go pick up a rock and say it's worth $100 for no reason besides my word (fiat currency on a micro scale), I (and my newfound rock currency) would fail. But if I could convince businesses to accept these rocks in exchange for their products, and back up this argument by showing them that this rock has tangible value in the fact that it facilitates transactions, then the free market would be able to properly set the exchange rate dependent on how many rocks it costs them to produce their widget and how many widgets they can profitably exchange for a rock. 
Businesses would be able to conduct trade on the basis of this fiat currency, and its utility would be widely accepted throughout society. But if we cannot get business on board, if we cannot make BTC widely accepted just as cash, Visa, Discover, or those little disposable gift cards, it will flounder. It is in proving utility to business that we can move past the stigma of confusing computer currency and toward an economy in which BTC plays an integral role.

@_date: 2013-04-15 22:32:51
I hope this is the truth. I see BTC as a currency that could facilitate global transactions with very little friction or political limitations.
The problem I see is that it is difficult for businesses to adopt BTC as a currency if they are at risk of selling off their inventory for BTC only to see the price of BTC fall well below the COGS.
And if BTC is not adopted by business as a currency, it will be overrun by speculators who want to manipulate it as if it were a security.

@_date: 2013-04-19 04:18:45
I collect BTC and cash out whatever I need to cover COGS, labor (I pay myself in BTC but employees still need cash), and overhead, but the rest is kept in my wallet. 
The volatility is worrisome (and is a major detractor for many businesses) but with more businesses accepting it we should (hopefully) see some stabilization.
@_date: 2013-07-31 15:57:33
Actually the *simplest* way would be to say "please send your BTC to this address" and then selling at the end of the day. 
As a merchant BTC really revolutionizes the way ecommerce is done, but by outsourcing payment processing to bitpay it's just like accepting fiat through paypal. BTC is so easy as it is to receive directly. And the *entire point* of BTC was to facilitate transactions between two parties *without the need for a third party processor*. Call me an idealist bitcoin nutjob, but isn't the whole point of a decentralized P2P currency to take back our financial liberty from those companies that make money off of nothing more than our financial transactions? I mean, everyone derides PayPal, Visa, MC, etc for doing nothing more than facilitating financial transactions yet taking a 3% cut. That's why we have BTC, to pull our financial transactions out of that dated system. So why, with the ease of use and efficiency of transfer already built in to BTC, would one willfully give up their financial liberty to a private corporation? BTC decentralizes and democratizes our economy. But if the first thing we do is give up that decentralization, why use BTC in the first place?

Why thank you! :) I tried to make the BTC checkout as streamlined as possible and actually *quicker and easier* than using a credit card.

I just love the fact that you can tap your phone to a computer screen and have money instantly transferred around the globe. 
*This* is what I expected the 21st century to be like. If email is immediate, if file transfers are immediate, if I can watch a meteor crash down in Russia less than five minutes after the fact, why are we still, in the 21st century, using a form of currency (paper money and metal coins) which hasn't changed for literally thousands of years? Bitcoin is revolutionizing the way money is transferred and business is done. Things become more efficient and faster. A businesses' market reach expands beyond their arbitrary national borders. Consumers around the globe get to decide what products they purchase - not based on external controls and tariffs, but based on their personal knowledge and desires. Bitcoin is democracy in finance. Bitcoin is the future.

First confirmation usually comes within a few seconds so I just check the address for an incoming transaction (each customer gets a unique address) and then print a simple "Confirmed" or "Unconfirmed" on my incoming invoice (if things are slow or backed up confirmations can take a little longer than expected so I just check those manually (my invoice automatically gives me a blockchain link) because I don't want to make the customer wait.

Even if they require 6 confirmations, they should email you as soon as it is picked up by the network. Then they can notify you when the funds actually "clear". This is why I'm all for the *true* decentralization of bitcoins by having merchants independently accept bitcoin rather than outsourcing it to Bitpay, the Paypal of bitcoin. When you have thousands of crafty developers all working on creating the *best* customer experience, you will be sure that UX will follow available technology closely. If everyone uses Bitpay blindlessly, the company has no incentive to continually upgrade and provide the best service possible.

I'm a small online business and I'm actually a bit worried about this.
I completely support paying my fair share. I use the state/federal infrastructure to ship goods, capitalize on this broad market to sell my products, and expect the judicial system to act as a fair arbiter in any business disagreements. So in that sense I have no problem paying taxes. 
I even collect sales tax on sales within my state (even for BTC sales!). And if this proposed law would simply institute an across-the-board online sales tax, I wouldn't have an issue with it.
It's when each individual state has the ability to determine their own tax that small businesses have an issue. So if this passes I would have to constantly stay on top of the tax rates in EACH state, update my site accordingly, file taxes in every state I make a sale (all 50), all while running the business.
I'm all for businesses paying their fair share. I even supported the "Amazon" tax in CA that would have online retailers based in CA collect sales tax. But spreading it across the country *on a state by state basis*? I'm fucked. It's not like i can add a broad 10% "Online sales tax". Now I have to follow the sales tax in Roswell GA, Medford OR, Saranac Lake NY, Porterville CA, Carson NV, etc. 
I hope this doesn't pass, or if it does, they at least make it more feasible for the little guy. It's tough enough as it is to compete with Amazon.

Seriously. I run a small business and when I get backed up due to a holiday rush or something similar I wake up at 5am and go to bed at midnight, spending the entire day working on catching up on orders that have already been placed. Marketing is the last thing you should think about when you can barely keep up with demand as is. Yes, small businesses need to grow. But their first priority should be to deliver what they promised to loyal customers who have already paid. They are digging their own grave by spending their customer's money on extraneous marketing expenses rather than bootstrapping and following through on their promises.

Say you purchase something from me for $10 using a credit card. *Technically* I can charge you $1,000 because you gave me your credit card number (essentially total access to your bank account) and *asked me* to only charge you $10. Whether I'm an honest business person or not determines whether you are charged the agreed-upon $10 or something else I decide at a later date. If, however, you handed me a $10 bill or $10 worth of BTC, *that's all I get*, and rightfully so, that's all we agreed to exchange. 
Basically 
Push Payments - You determine how much I get and "push" that amount to me. If I want more I have to come to you and ask for more or go to court and sue you for the remainder.
Pull Payments - You give me free reign in your checking account and *hope* I only take what we agreed for me to take. If I take more then the onus is on you to prove that it was a fraudulent transaction and then your bank will come after me to get your money back. But in the meantime I'm off enjoying life with *your* money.
If I initiate a chargeback for the payments I did not authorize then I lose complete access to my Amazon/BofA/BOE account and it will go into arrears, tanking my credit score. They know this which is why they can continue drafting my account without worry of retribution.

I'm a merchant so every transaction I receive is sent to a one-use disposable address. When I want fiat I just send that to a one-use address at my exchange.

That's pretty anonymous if you ask me.

So if you want *total* control of your private keys you have to set up your own processor. That could entail running a full node of bitcoind, however I simply use a DB with pubkeys to be completely sure my keys are separate from my site. Setting up your own handrolled processor will take some time, but once it's up it will basically run itself. The most basic BTC implementation needs only 1) a receiving address 2) a calculation of the current exchange rate 3) a way to determine whether the BTC was received. That's it. You can see how I do it on my site (google my name). Like I said, it's super easy to do. I just have a DB of receiving addresses, and display one when the customer checks out. I then calculate the coinbase exchange rate (that's where I sell so that's where I calculate my rate) every twenty minutes, cache the rate, and display that to the customer (the caching is to protect myself from sudden rises/drops in price, as well as to provide a single amount to the customer upon checkout - otherwise, they may reload the page only to find the price changed due to a fluctuating exchange rate). All the while I am checking that receiving address for funds with a websocket to real-time blockchain data. As soon as the transaction is sent I process the transaction and load the "Thank you" page. All of this is automatic and it took me about three days to implement from idea to working system. Then, when I'm ready to receive my fiat, I just log into coinbase and sell the coins I received that day, and the fiat is deposited into my account in 1 business day. Now I have the peace of mind knowing I'm the only one who controls my money. If an exchange suddenly goes under I'm still protected because the only one with access to my keys is me.
Bitpay and coinbase are like paypal - they give you a code snippet you put on your site and they do all the hard work for you. The downside there is that they take a portion (1%) and they control your privkeys.

The problem with the ATM is that it isn't actually an ATM but rather a BTC sales kiosk. That means the business in which the "ATM" is located would come under FinCEN MSB oversight. So for businesses unwilling to accept BTC as it is, having to file with the govt as a MSB simply to install a machine for a currency they are already wary about is pointless. 
We need to work on increasing native adoption of BTC, not hacked workarounds that nullify the entire point of BTC transactions.

So I'm guessing you don't want to use a third party payment processor? Me neither (I too run a webshop). I searched high and low for something that would do just what you are asking for and although there are some pretty good libraries out there (this was just posted  I decided to go it on my own.
    &lt;script&gt;
     function Print_BTCtotal(){
     ComputeCartPrices();
       rate="&lt;?php include(' ?&gt;";
       BTCs = (g_TotalCost*rate).toFixed(4);
       document.write(BTCs);}
    &lt;/script&gt;
I then call up an array of pre-generated receiving addresses, select one at random, and display it to the customer. 
You can see it all in action [here]( (Just add something to your cart and click the bitcoin button on the bottom). 
It's probably not the *best* implementation but it surely gets the job done.

It totally is fair and it's how it is logged in my books. It's a fee incurred for no other reason that because I am selling my product on their site. It's a merchant service fee whether it's a percentage or a hard numerical amount. Just like how PayPal charges 3.75% *plus* $0.15. Even though that $0.15 is not a percentage of the charge but rather a fee for simply using the service (whether the order is $0.01 or $1,000), it is still considered a fee associated with doing business with that particular company.

Moving between addresses shouldn't be an issue, issues regarding confirmations only arise when you are trying to sell for fiat. Also, it is up to the accepting merchant whether or not they require all 6 confirmations. Some like myself will accept BTC immediately with no confirmations (and IIRC namecheap relented and now accept 1 confirmation transactions) while others (most often those operating with high-priced products or financial transfers) will require more confirmations.

@_date: 2013-07-29 15:50:52
Uh... no? 
I accept bitcoins on my site and have none of these issues, so I'm not entirely sure what you're doing? If you're accepting bitcoins in a transaction there are no FINCEN regulations, it's like barter. If you're trying to operate as a money transmitter you will obviously come under higher scrutiny, but to "take bitcoins" on your site all you need is a receiving address and nothing more. Also it's quite obvious you would have to register your business if you want to open a business account. You will also have to get a TIN from the IRS, but that has nothing to do with bitcoins, it's just what you have to do when you run a business.

I consider myself middle of the road (I'm in the US) and I'm a vocal proponent of Bitcoins. My father is extremely liberal and just jumped on the Bitcoin bandwagon. My uncle is an uber-conservative financial analyst for Merrill Lynch and supports bitcoin. Bitcoin is apolitical. Sure, it may be used by libertarians and anarcho-capitalists who want BTC to surpass the USD, but it is also used by ordinary citizens who just want an efficient and easy means of financial transfer. To make the claim that Bitcoins are somehow affiliated with one political movement fails to acknowledge that people from all walks of life use BTC with no political motivations whatsoever.

@_date: 2013-04-16 13:51:02
But doesn't that defeat the purpose? At that point they're just piggybacking on BTC, not actually using it or contributing to the market development. For this experiment to really work businesses not only have to accept it, but *use* it. They have to keep some BTC as an asset (just as they do cash) and be able to purchase goods and services with it. But the problem they see it the wildly fluctuating exchange rate which makes companies like bitpay seem good, as stated above, it will lead to a monopoly of bitpay. Plus, the whole point of BTC was decentralized direct payments. If we have the infrastructure to do so, why usurp our payment processing power over to a third party? IMO bitpay defeats the purpose of getting businesses involved.

This is what I keep saying. Bitcoin can seriously change the way small (and large) businesses operate. Don't get me wrong, the market is currently tiny. But every time I get a BTC order compared to a fiat order I breath a sigh of relief. I know my money is already in my wallet (no waiting over a week for my money like with traditional payment processors), and there's no more 3% fees. Additionally, it has broadened my market reach beyond my national borders, and BTC orders tend to be from around the globe, allowing me to "spread my wings" business-wise. 
It just makes everything so much easier. The biggest thing for me (and probably any other small business) is the fact that it is *immediate*. I just had a huge wholesale order go out yesterday. While the customer paid in full and I sent out the product immediately, I will not see that money for over a week. So now I'm stuck in business limbo - no inventory to sell, no money to purchase raw materials to make more inventory. Bitcoin makes that problem a thing of the past. If I got 50 bitcoin orders right now it wouldn't be a problem. As they are coming in I could easily buy supplies as necessary. 
Bitcoin truly will revolutionize the way small businesses operate. There's a bit of a learning curve and it's difficult for one to see the benefits because the market is currently so small so when a business does get a BTC order it's like once a month or so, but taking a step back, it's blatantly obvious the numerous benefits this currency has.

So I can go on for days explaining the difference (and considering I just had my morning coffee I'll have to force myself to be brief) but the tl;dr of *that* rant would be:
- Conventional soaps contain harsh industrial surfactants (the same used in car washes) that lead to dry and irritated skin. A lot of times you'll see a product labeled as "cleansing bar" or "body wash" because it *isn't actually chemically soap* but rather an amalgamation of filler ingredients with some surfactants put in to make it suds up.
- Conventional soaps often use preservatives, fragrances, and additives known to be irritating and for those of with sensitive skin, these wreak havoc on our skin.
- Conventional soaps *dry out* skin which is why when you get out of the shower you feel like your skin is pulled taught and is "squeaky" clean. *That's not good*. You should feel the most refreshed when you get out of the shower, not like you just came out of a desert wind tunnel.
- Most companies formulate their products to produce the highest profit per mL. This means lots of water, fillers, and low quality ingredients. Conversely, I spent years formulating my products with *only* the highest quality materials to create something that *actually works*. If you look at my label compared to others *it actually makes sense*. 
- as always, there's *so much more* but I won't bore you with my soap talk ;)

**EDIT: If it's not clear enough, this post was stating how less tech-savvy businesses perceive bitcoins. NOT my personal opinion.**
This is stated a lot but it's a logical fallacy (when viewing the situation from a business' perspective). 
Volatility is the first sign of a weak market. Doesn't matter if there is an immediate conversion. Doesn't matter if they never even see BTC. The underlying market is very unstable and as seen by traditional businesses, not to be trusted.
Businesses are risk averse and aren't willing to take such a significant risk of accepting an untested, unknown, and essentially unused currency for only a 2% return (from what they see as a negligibly larger market nonetheless -- everyone and their mother uses PayPal; only a small sliver of computer-savvy people use BTC, and of those who do, the vast majority hold it as an investment, not use it as a currency). Businesses just don't see the benefits. 
Even with fiat conversion, the costs outweigh the benefits. Only when the price stabilizes will more businesses begin to adopt BTC.

On Sunday the exchange was ~1BTC=$100 USD. I priced my products accordingly, selling a $5 item for 0.05 BTC. But then the rate dropped down to $50, then up to $70, and now $90. How can I be sure I will recoup the cost of goods when the currency fluctuates over 50% in a day? Say it drops to $50 USD for a week- then I'm selling products at a loss because of BTCs volatility. 
I really want to price my products in BTC. It would definitely contribute to stabilization. But with the price fluctuating so much, the best I can do is accept BTC at the current going market price, meaning my prices fluctuate significantly with market shifts. 
Once the price finds a niche where it can stay between 1/2 a standard deviation a day, then I will fix my prices in BTC. But I lost half my BTC revenue this weekend (physical product, so there are unavoidable costs such as raw materials) simply due to a market shift.

Trust me, it's not something I want to do. I would say the largest hindrance to growing my business is the traditional financial system: money I make today won't be in my bank for (with some payment processors) three weeks. That means if I sell out today, I can't restock for almost a month. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is instantaneously in my wallet and available for use. If I hypothetically had a HUGE day of bitcoin sales, I would be able to scale effectively without hitting a bottleneck because as orders were coming in I would be able to increase my purchase orders for raw materials as needed. 
I really hate fiat. But it's just like why I accept PayPal - with 99% of the world using fiat and PayPal, I would put myself out of business if I didn't accept it. It's a necessary evil but until we can secure wider market adoption by merchants and greater transactional usage by consumers, I'm kind of stuck. And they know that, which is why they can gouge merchants however they see fit and hold my hard earned money for weeks, making interest the whole time while *charging me*.

I'm happy having total control of my privkeys and selling to coinbase when necessary. Considering bitcoin is all about decentralization and not trusting (or even having to use) a third party company who wants to take a portion of every sale or can cut you off from your own money at any time, I like the idea that I can be anywhere in the world, pull up Android wallet/Mycelium and have TOTAL control of MY money. No hoping the coinbase servers are down, no worry of DDoS, no worry of a MITM attack. My money is in MY control. And that's how it should be.

That's why I'm not necessarily a huge proponent of begging Amazon to accept Bitcoin. I mean it would be cool if they did, but it's somewhat ironic to me that we are on the precipice of a global financial revolution underpinned by Bitcoin and rather than going out and building an anarchocapitalistic/leftlib/anything-other-than-big-box economy, we are *begging* the big box stores to accept our money. THEY are the ones who fucked us over the first 100 times. THEY are the ones that make it their mission to destroy small businesses to suck up their market share and pad their pockets. THEY are the ones that buy off politicians to get government to serve the interests of the wealthy rather than the people. Yet WE are begging THEM to TAKE our money. 
tl;dr support small businesses. It's cliché but they truly are the backbone of an economy with a viable middle class.

THIS. People see the warning and think "Well why would a scammer warn me about scams? This is *obviously* legitimate!" without even following through on what the warning says. 
It's just like when ecommerce sites put that little lock/"Secure Checkout" next to the credit card details screen. That JPEG does nothing to increase security, yet sales increase 15-20% with it. So while ecommerce sites are locked-down with super strong backend security measures, people won't buy without a visual assurance of "security".

This. BTC is an *amazing* currency for businesses. It makes financial transfers a snap and faster than credit cards. It makes it possible to conduct business around the world. The problem for business is the highly volatile exchange rate. For BTC to become widely adopted it needs to be used by business. And not just bitpay, because that doesn't help stabilize the BTC economy, it just sells the BTC as soon as they're received. As a business, I can't keep assets in BTC if I can't be sure I will have enough to purchase raw materials. I sold 3 BTC worth of product ($300 at the time) last weekend. Now that is worth $150. How do you run a business when you can't even trust your currency to stay within a $20 range?

My prices are definitely not set in stone and will invariably change over time and with the growth of the company. You're right in that some people see low prices and think the (relatively) low price equates to low quality, however since I had personal experience with spending hundreds of dollars a month on ineffective skin care treatments, I made a vow that when I found some thing that worked, I would make it available for everyone who wanted it.
As for the block chain, it usually takes about 25 minutes for it to show up, and once it is verified your order will ship. Transactions are given a pseudo-random address so we know if there is a transfer for a particular amount, and you're the only person who was given the address, then that serves as verification. I played around with associated the email/order# with the address, but I felt that kind of defeated the purpose of an anonymous crypto currency.

It really helps when people buy products in BTC. Not only does it help us businesses build BTC reserves (so that we can use them to buy our materials and necessary services), it helps stabilize the currency as the free market begins to peg the value of BTC against more stable commodities and services used in business!
I have the strong belief that BTC can change the way business is done around the world. It levels the playing ground for us "little guys" to compete in a global market without huge corporate entities from squelching our voices. BTC is democracy in the marketplace.

That's what I'm saying: it's not a "free market" where responsible adults make decisions if we all have someone holding our hand and promising us everything will be alright. 
Escrow defeats the whole purpose of instant global transactions between two consenting individuals. It takes the power to trade out of both your hands and mine and gives it off to a private corporation who will then charge us money to take something from you and hand it to me.
If you want to have some private corporation "protect you" and determine who gets what money, use PayPal. It has its merits which is why I accept it. But if you want the financial freedom to use your money how you see fit without external intervention, use bitcoin.

Bitcoin Black Friday was my company's biggest day in sales... Ever. Those of you who know me know I strongly support the BTC economy so I converted just enough to cover the COGS so I can restock my inventory. While I'm not a fan of the volatility, I understand it's a necessity [for now] so the market can find the "right" value of bitcoin according to true supply and demand. Ultimately I would *like* to see less volatility just so I can safely keep more business funds in my wallet rather than in my credit union but expecting that before more widespread consumer use would be putting the cart before the horse. Did my business lose money because of the volatility? No doubt about it. However I'm just happy to be a part of this global financial revolution powered by the people. Sure there will be some hiccups. But in the end, we'll come out victorious.

Look at it from a business perspective. His overhead is all in fiat and $1 fiat today will be "worth" (obviously with inflation, SOL, etc it has a different value, but its value is perceived as the same) $1 USD next year. 1 Bitcoin, on the other hand, can be worth $120 today, $90 tomorrow, or $45 next April. He has no clue what it will be worth, but all he knows is that his suppliers want a finite amount of fiat, regardless of the fluctuating bitcoin economy.
It's a Catch-22. The currency will not stabilize until more businesses accept it and it becomes more widespread. But businesses will not accept it until they are sure they can pay bills with it (stabilization) and there's *actually* a market (widespread usage).

Coinbase has a significant delay in pushing transactions to the blockchain. If you are making a purchase/transfer use a real wallet program.
As a BTC merchant it's always a pain to weed out the orders made with Coinbase from the rest - the customer sent the BTC hours ago but I don't get it for hours in the future, with no record of the transaction in the blockchain.
When you purchase BTC from coinbase send them to your own wallet and transact from there. 
EDIT: I'd just like to say that coinbase is *great* for buying/selling BTC for USD, but it's not so good as a wallet. Something like MultiBit, Electum, QT, Mycelium, etc will have the full wallet functionality you're looking for and you'll no longer be reliant on a central server to control your privkeys.

I'm a merchant and trust me, there is risk.
Bitpay does nothing to benefit the actual BTC economy but instead allows businesses to accept BTC and immediately convert them to USD. So this does not help stabilize because rather than using BTC to conduct business (the ideal scenario), businesses are dumping them back into the market as soon as they receive them.
For someone like me who truly believes in the BTCeconomy, the goal is to collect payments in BTC, keep it in BTC, and then use those BTCs to purchase our materials. That way the exchange rate will begin to stabilize according to the commodities required to produce a good which are relatively more stable.
If I sold products totaling $1000 USD in costs yesterday and received 10 BTC for it but then the exchange rate falls so that those BTC are only worth $10 (for example only), then why would I continue to accept BTC? What would prompt a business to take such large risks for such a small return? 
For those interested in profiting from bid/ask spreads, day trading, and speculation, then yes, there is profit in a fluctuating market. But for businesses selling physical goods or the product of manual labor, there are fixed costs that cannot be disregarded when discussing the viability of alternative currencies.

1. Very true; all my bitcoin transactions have been online. Bitcoins are like cash for online transactions (as a merchant BTC is one of the best payment solutions possible) so seeing it take hold in face-to-face transactions will take some more effort. It's easier to prove its efficiency in online transactions where sellers are used to waiting weeks to receive their money compared to traditional face-to-face cash transactions in which merchants *expect* to have their money immediately. The latter would need to be convinced it benefits them over traditional fiat cash.
2. It doesn't motivate them to start using BTC directly, but it *does* show that there are businesses abound that accept the currency for everyday purchases. Many times I propose bitcoins and the other party says "Why, I'm not buying drugs or computer parts?" By showing there is an entire economy with computer repairs, food, consumer goods, accouterments, etc, it will show there is more to BTC than SR or BFL.

For transactions within the BTC economy yes; but if you were to receive Bitcoins *right now* and want to sell them for fiat you would have to wait for the 6 confirmations. I accept 0 confirmation transactions in my store but I still have to wait for 6 confirmations before I can actually convert it to USD (I don't use BitPay, so I *actually* accept bitcoins rather than outsourcing that aspect of my business to a third party paypal-esque payment processor).

While I agree on one level, the same argument could be made for any currency: with the "value" of almost every global currency on the rise, why make a purchase?
But in the end, the intrinsic value of the currency itself is predicated on the use of that currency in the market. BTC is rising because more are using it in transactions. But if we all started hoarding and used BTC as a security rather than a currency and never actually *use it in market exchanges*, over time, the value of BTC would fall.
Currencies get their value through the value assigned to them by the market. But if not in use in the market the associated value will decline.

Yeah that's what I'm looking forward to. I (personally) have been in bitcoins for a while but only recently started accepting them on my site.
Now I just have to sit and watch it until it stables out. I set all my prices in BTC as a ratio of dollars (BTC is still to volatile to price products directly in BTC) so when the market moves so do my prices, and any market uncertainty causes consumers to contract on spending and wait out the roller coaster.

I take 0 conf transactions in less than 2 seconds. I have my site setup to send the customers' order to the DB as soon as the payment hits the blockchain and the only time there was *any delay whatsoever* was with a tx-fee-free transaction. Any transaction with the minimum tx will clear nearly instantaneously. 
Also, coffee shops, donut stores, and convenience stores don't really have to worry about waiting for confirmations. It's comparable to if someone wrote you a check for $3.50. Yeah, they may not have that $ in their account and in that case you would be burned for $3.50 with a 0 conf transaction, but the ease of use would surpass the need to check the balance of every check before handing over the goods. Now if they were buying a $500k lambo then yeah, wait for the confirmations.
But for small goods under $10-20 it's too much work and too little return for a nefarious person to attempt a double spend. Why go through all the hassle to double-spend $3.50?

We're reluctant to do so when we see the exchange rate drop from $104 to $50.01 in one day. If I sold a widget for 1BTC at the beginning I would have lost half my money and the product hasn't even been sent. 
And bitpay does nothing to help the economy. It takes BTC and dumps them back into the market. For those merchants like myself who truly believe in BTC, it's counterproductive. It doesn't help expand our economy. It doesn't create a system in which smaller businesses pressure their suppliers to accept BTC. All it does is codify in business owners the stigma that BTC is highly volatile and not to be trusted on its own. If they have to use a third party service just so they don't lose their COGS, it will be very difficult for them to promote BTC and pressure suppliers to accept it. They don't trust the currency themselves, and without business on board, without private industry, it will flounder. The opportunities for BTC are endless, if we can prove their efficacy. But if no business accepts them, they're pointless.  
Businesses won't take BTC until they know they can have BTC in their wallet without the value fluctuating more than 50% in a day.

It also makes international sales much easier and faster. I'm just always amazed at the fact that someone in Germany can send me money and it is in my wallet *immediately* with no fees taken out. With traditional financial services it takes well over a week and I lose 3% of my gross.
Bitcoin makes the global free market *actually free* in the sense that no central bank can tell me if I can access my own money and how I can spend it. Today is a great example. Today is a holiday so all the banks are shut down. I basically have no access to my own money, and if I try to make large withdrawals I will be locked out of the system. I have customers around the world, yet I'm limited to the 9-5 M-F hours of banks in New York.
It's 2013. Businesses are looking to forge ties around the world. A rising tide lifts all boats, right? But not when the antiquated banking system has placed arbitrary controls on the flow of capital.

As it is a loan, interest is charged so that when the money comes back (which, I should add, happens 98% of the time - the poor have a higher repayment rate than the rich!) it can be reused to benefit even *more* people. There are very lenient repayment terms without penalties and NO collateral required. Rather than using the "stick" of penalty rates, the program uses the "carrot" of future loans, so recipients who repay the loan on time are "upgraded" and able to borrow *more* in the future. 


I don't actually run the micro-loan organization, which itself is a 501(c)3 nonprofit. I'm a social entrepreneur applying business principles to social issues, so I sell my products and a significant portion of the proceeds are provided as microloans. Think of it as having the means of business with the ends of a non-profit. Rather than being reliant on continued donations or grants, it's a self-sustaining business with a social cause as a key part of the business' mission. If you're interested, look up Muhammad Yunus and "Social Business". It's such a simple concept that needs to be replicated elsewhere. Instead of looking at the world in dichotomous terms of "profit VS social good" we should look at how to take the infrastructural benefits of PMBs and apply that to social causes around the world.


Loans are provided in fiat and repaid in fiat. The only time BTC comes into play is when someone purchases a good from my site with BTC, and of that purchase a portion is provided (in fiat) as a loan. So I assume the risk of fluctuating exchange rates. 


**NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO**. I work with like-minded socially active people who are *literally* on the ground in each of the countries these loans are given. There are no governmental organizations involved, no private banking intermediaries, no third party loan sharks. Loans are provided through local loan groups of about 20 individuals who mutually insure each other's investment. [Kiva operates much differently than traditional microfinance institutions]( raising the ire of people like myself who wrongly get lumped in with them. Kiva is more of a marketing program for MAXIMA loans whereas the money I provide goes from my bank account to the account of the 501(c)3 to the people on the ground in Uganda, Tanzania, etc.

So did you actually *use* bitcoins? 
It's one thing for businesses to accept them, it's another for them to actually *take* them. What I mean by that is that for most businesses that are starting to accept BTC, they don't entirely understand how it works/why it's better - all they know is they should accept it.
But when we all start *paying* them in BTC they will see the real-world application and be larger and more vocal proponents rather than begrudgingly accepting it.
Case in point: I LOVE bitcoins and understand their fx and background (well, as much as one can). So while I accept cash, check, credit card, paypal, google wallet, etc, if a customer asks what my preferred method is, I will always start off with BTC. Why? Because I've seen first hand the benefits of BTC over other methods.
So while these businesses *accept* BTC, they may not *understand* it. And it's through them promoting the use of BTC will we see greater adoption. 
@_date: 2013-04-19 20:14:06
While I agree more merchants accepting BTC will reduce volatility (read through my post history and you'll see I'm a strong proponent of this).
I think if businesses would actually accept BTC directly rather than using a third party payment processor which immediately converts to USD, they would have more of a vested interest in maintaining stability. 
IMO bitpay allows businesses to say "we accept BTC" without actually involving themselves in the BTC economy. They don't directly contribute to stabilization because volatility doesn't affect them so they have no incentive to work toward stabilizing the currency - they want to get in and out before the price changes. 
Right now businesses 1) are less likely to get involved in the first place due to volatility and 2) for those that use bitpay, they couldn't care less about volatility *because* it immediately converts it to USD.

The fact that it is so boring is actually good. Bitcoin is becoming mainstream.

The fact that it is so mundane and boring is proof positive that BTC is becoming just another aspect of everyday life.

I probably sound like a broken record by now but I completely agree. Look at my post history and all I talk about is the effect of BTC volatility on merchants (being one myself I see it first hand). Here's a comment I made to this end:
Not only does volatility make companies wary of accepting bitcoins, no one purchases when the market is fluctuating.
Everyone is going to say "Bitpay fixes that problem" but it doesn't address the underlying issue of a highly volatile currency. Bitpay is just like PayPal only for bitcoins. The point of bitcoins was decentralized transactions based on a crypto currency, why route all payments though another processor? 
Furthermore, I think if businesses would actually accept BTC directly rather than using a third party payment processor which immediately converts to USD, they would have more of a vested interest in maintaining stability.
IMO bitpay allows businesses to say "we accept BTC" without actually involving themselves in the BTC economy. They don't directly contribute to stabilization because volatility doesn't affect them so they have no incentive to work toward stabilizing the currency - they want to get in and out before the price changes.
Right now businesses 1) are less likely to get involved in the first place due to volatility and 2) for those that use bitpay, they couldn't care less about volatility because it immediately converts it to USD.
Plus, businesses still worry about the volatility even if they are 'protected' by bitpay. Volatility is a signal of a weak and (to many, untrusted) market. Even if they can convert to fiat, most are still are wary of accepting it in the first place. 
Additionally, bitpay doesn't actually allow merchants to operate in the bitcoin economy. They have no incentive to further the bitcoin economy. It's when people and business have an individual vested interest in something (in this case, the bitcoin economy) will they actively work to better it.
When businesses start accepting bitcoins directly and not immediately converting them to fiat we will see some stabilization.

There aren't really any plug &amp; chug BTC shopping carts, but it's super easy to develop your own that perfectly suits your needs. 
Here's how I did it. All you need for a BTC payment processor is:
1) a receiving address
2) a calculation of the current exchange rate
3) a way to determine whether the BTC was received. 
That's it. You can see how I do it on my site (google my name).
Like I said, it's super easy to do. I just have a DB of receiving addresses and display one when the customer checks out. I then calculate the coinbase exchange rate (that's where I sell so that's where I calculate my rate) every twenty minutes, cache the rate, and display that to the customer (the caching is to protect myself from sudden rises/drops in price, as well as to provide a single amount to the customer upon checkout - otherwise, they may reload the page only to find the price changed due to a fluctuating exchange rate). All the while I am checking that receiving address for funds with a simple jQuery call. As soon as the transaction is sent I process the transaction and load the "Thank you" page. All of this is automatic and it took me about three days to implement from idea to working system. 
If you find yourself in a jam feel free to message me and I'll be happy to help! :)

Can you actually sell your BTC on Gox and receive fiat in a timely manner?
It's supply and demand. There's a lot of buys on gox and not many sells, driving the price past the "true" market value as seen in a more liquid exchange such as coinbase.

Bitcoin really seems *perfect* for small businesses. 
I mean, when you purchase something on my site with a credit card or PayPal I have to wait ~7 business days before I receive the funds. If you purchase through Amazon or redditGifts, that goes up to 14 business days. 
If I have an *awesome* day and sell out all my inventory, I have to wait *half a month* before I can actually access that money to purchase more inventory and supplies.
With BTC, if you make a purchase today, I have the money tomorrow, making it *much easier* to quickly respond to the demands of the market. 
A while back my site got to the front page of a popular sub and sales skyrocketed for a day. I was frantically trying to ship out orders while make new product, but my money was tied up by payment processors and I was dead in the water.
A few weeks ago I got an influx of BTC orders and was not only able to ship them out the day of, I was also able to purchase the materials to restock *immediately*.
Bitcoin has changed my operation from hobbling along waiting for the banks to give me *my* money, to a streamlined and extremely efficient business that can quickly adapt to changing market forces.
When I say Bitcoin is revolutionizing the way business is done, I'm not exaggerating. It's just like cash, except I (nor my customers) are limited by arbitrary national borders. It allows citizens of the United States to the Ukraine to communicate and trade freely without the heavy hand of an oppressive government or big business preventing them from doing so.
Bitcoin is democracy in the marketplace. Bitcoin is the future.

Yeah I took a pretty significant loss this past weekend. Here's hoping the market will stabilize so I can reset my prices in BTC. These fluctuations hurt both the casual investor and the business using BTC as a currency (both because of devaluation and the inherent consumer contraction that comes with market decline). Here's hoping it will somewhat stabilize so we can work together to build a strictly BTC economy!

@_date: 2013-07-31 16:25:07
Don't get me wrong, it will take a *little* bit of time setting up your own decentralized payment processor but when it's done it runs itself. But considering your business is 3D printers made for geeks you most likely know how to code and the most basic BTC implementation needs only 
1) a receiving address
2) a calculation of the current exchange rate
3) a way to determine whether the BTC was received. 
That's it. You can see how I do it on my site (google my name).
Like I said, it's super easy to do. I just have a DB of receiving addresses, and display one when the customer checks out. I then calculate the coinbase exchange rate (that's where I sell so that's where I calculate my rate) every twenty minutes, cache the rate, and display that to the customer (the caching is to protect myself from sudden rises/drops in price, as well as to provide a single amount to the customer upon checkout - otherwise, they may reload the page only to find the price changed due to a fluctuating exchange rate). All the while I am checking that receiving address for funds with a simple jQuery call. As soon as the transaction is sent I process the transaction and load the "Thank you" page. All of this is automatic and it took me about three days to implement from idea to working system. Then, when I'm ready to receive my fiat, I just log into coinbase and sell the coins I received that day, and the fiat is deposited into my account in 1 business day. 
Now I have the peace of mind knowing I'm the only one who controls my money. If an exchange suddenly goes under I'm still protected because the only one with access to my keys is me.

Well I'm a business myself and I don't want to use bitpay (I have an account with them, but I'd rather not use it). I accept payment directly from the customer and simply set a weighted exchange average as the market shifts. IMO if businesses let their prices fluctuate wildly it will only contribute to these fluctuations. But by keeping prices at a fixed price in BTC (relatively- adjusted on an hourly/daily basis) merchants are able to contribute to the stabilization and diversification of BTCs. Plus with more merchants accepting BTC (like my webhost!), merchants will actually have an incentive to keep assets in BTC rather than immediately exchange them for fiat currency.
