This was Satoshi vision. You basically just explained why the BCH people get upset they are said to be stealing some idea when they are the only group that is trying to adhere to the ideology set forth in the original Bitcoin whitepaper. 
Satoshi said eventually server farms will be the ones running the network and that average users can get by with just downloading the header data of the blockchain, not the entire chain. 
Like the guy you were replying to said, everyone just turns it into a massive drama and pissing match. There is room for both to survive. They don't have to work together. Competition brings advancements. 
Without competition you get a monopoly. In the idea of decentralization we should be quite happy there are several choices out there. 
This being said, I sold my Bitcoin when it hit $19,500 because I feel the ridiculous fees and consumer rejection is going to propel it's competitors.  This is just a financial call on my part. I still have no issue with Bitcoin. 
Bitcoin. Bitcoin cash. Bitcoin Gold. They don't matter. They will live until they are outed as being the same hot air as all the rest. Then that money will move to a different crypto. The only way to hedge against all this childish fighting is to own some of them all.

Full disclosure: I use this bot to trade personally and have had amazing results with combining multiple indicators into a single strategy. I use 10-15 bots with different configurations at different times for different currencies. Not one configuration will make you rich, but the program will not allow negative trades if you do not disable its failsafe.

Yep I have received this too. Seems the emails hacked from bitcointalk.org have been put to use.
Btw, the thieves have long been interested in Bitcoin. Some of the largest botnets on the net now target Bitcoin as well. Just stay alert and don't open anything. Best you should do is just upload the file to virustotal.com or another cloud virus repository.

Also, since I still have a balance on here, I will be tipping 1,000 Dogecoin to anyone that shows that they successfully used the code to get the 5% off deal.
Trying to promote this bot for traders interested in such technology as the developer is highly legit and will satisfy refund requests if asked. I personally have made WAY more using this bot than it costs, but that is not a guarantee since you still have to develop your own trade strategy.

Across exchanges with several hundred sell orders properly distributed on price... You are right. It wouldn't.

I personally opened it and allowed Java to run in a lab-setup and did not see it successfully install anything or contact its server. That system was a fully updated Win8-64bit.
Linux is most definitely safe from what it was attempting.
Also, if I remember correctly (I deal with a lot of these), this is the link for the file it attempted to drop. 
@_date: 2017-02-24 17:28:46
The easiest way would be to contact an off-chain broker. They would have access to other buyers that want to buy your large amount. And since the transaction occurs off-chain it wouldn't effect the price at all. This isn't the same method I mentioned but it is far easier for your average whale investor. 
The method I mentioned, it would take several hundred sell orders at minimum properly distributed across price and exchange. The time for complete filling of orders would be determined by current market volume on each exchange you use. 
Tl:Dr; if you are selling 30M Bitcoin, contact an off-chain broker to help.

Explains everything thanks. 
@_date: 2017-02-10 17:18:21
No. The trade is locked into coinbase at a specific date. Then they do a bank transfer which takes 3-4 days but your rate doesn't change.

She took it off for sleep and to clean. I yelled at her many times. When she actually lost it, I won. Unfortunately.
By "gag" I really mean I mined my bitcoin and invested $ around $70/btc so I am not overly concerned about missing a little to get a ring. Also not sure I am wanting to spend $5000+ again at this moment just since I need my money for other investments and things.
I will check Etsy, but I like the idea of Overstock having refund policies and being an established retailer. It will also improve their income numbers that Amazon will be eagle-eyeing.

Well I'm a programmer so if I felt like I would need to dump 30 million, I would have written a script that can do it by using the exchange APIs and creating many small sell orders. 
It would be as easy as "pulling a trigger"
But yeah, maybe you average bitcoiner would have trouble. That's fair to say

Yeah I was just being a stickler about the $12/month. It costs a lot more than that.. but you may be able to offset those costs by pushing them off on someone else. Or ignoring them. But that doesn't help anyone's budgeting.

I never send less than that. And I use trezor too which is actually mycellium creating the transaction. Trezor just signs
@_date: 2017-02-12 20:01:01
Local bitcoins dealers almost ALWAYS have a premium on the cost. 
If the coinbase price is $1000 local bitcoins will be around $1100 on average. Keep that in mind and don't do it JUST because you have a chance of meeting another bitcoiner
@_date: 2017-02-10 17:19:00
Mycelium "normal" fee
And it usually takes about 30 minutes to get 3 confirmations

So I have never had a single problem with delays when sending transactions. What are y'all doing 
@_date: 2016-01-25 03:43:45
The cost of the space in your house. The need to have internet 24/7. The need to never lose power, unplug or rearrange where the server is stored.
Now.. decide if you can handle all that in your own way, with certain failsafes. Otherwise, cloud hosting makes your job easier and your house more firesafe.
@_date: 2017-02-10 06:26:45
I found out long ago that you can make a large purchase order on coinbase and simply withdraw the funds before it executes if you want it to cancel. There is no penalty. 
Do with this what you will..

I just laugh at people like you. 
"I have over $200k in digital funds. I'm cool guys. Like me"
Why would anyone willingly paint a target on their own head like that? Do you just want to brag that you have that much invested? Or do you really want your account prioritized to hackers?
And sure sure. You have it all in cold storage with on a wallet that never made a transfer on the block chain. Sure. We all do. 
Regardless of where you store it, people with millions of dollars often keep that shit secret. Only in the Bitcoin world do they constantly try to show off. 
@_date: 2016-06-21 03:42:22
Hey you. Hey guy..

@_date: 2016-06-21 03:35:20
I was mainly saying I'm sure he took steps to be secure but that may not always work out. 
An off block chain transaction is a signed TX that just hasn't yet been broadcast to the Bitcoin network. Or even the physical transferring of coin from person to person by trading private keys. 
The TX has to be on the block chain at some point. 
My wording was poor. I don't believe you can transfer coin from person to person over the internet without that coin having ever shown up on the block chain. Again, you could transfer the wallets private key, but they would still have been on the block chain. However, the transfer from person A to person B would be unknown since it never happened on the block chain. 
Some of this logic is how Bitcoin tumblers work.
I'm a little drunk and a lot stupid. Dont trust me. 
@_date: 2016-06-21 03:38:58

Btw, probably too late now, but deleting data from a hard drive does not usually delete it. It just frees the addresses to be used by other data. 
If you delete data. Then download a ton of new data, the new data will overwrite the old data and it IS now gone forever. 
You might, depending on how long ago the factory reset was, want to contact drive savers and ask them if they can attempt to help you out here. 
Drive savers can take a hard drive and recover the data pretty efficiently. As long as your phone was not encrypted which I'm guessing yours wasn't. 
Drive savers can be costly, but if you recover even a dollar of your $2500 it might be worth it.

@_date: 2016-12-30 04:28:21
If you think it's far too late then why are you here? Most people here, myself included, see $1000 as just the beginning of mass adoption. We are in the INFANCY of global Bitcoin. Very few large markets are even involved at this point. 
The market cap is $15 BN. That is not much. But it is growing. If Bitcoin competes with gold market cap will be $200bn or more and Bitcoin will be around $100k or more. 
If you think a 100x return is negligible then definitely stay away from forex

That's not even really a comprehensible answer.

The people you are used to talking to on this forum hold either a black or white stance on the Bitcoin thing. Guess what? The diversity of my portfolio makes it where I largely don't give a fuck. I sit back and hold the coins while day trading the ones with the highest volume. 
I'm paid my man. Never going back to a normal job. So I think I'm ok by now. 
Still though. Bitcoin has been toxic lately from what I can tell. The only attack people have against Bitcoin cash is name calling against Roger. That really makes me want to research their view points in depth let me tell ya

Your argument only makes sense if you disregard all context and stay in your bubble your created. 
Good argument ?

Bitcoin.org is not satoshis site anymore and hasn't been for some time. I wouldn't take the stuff said on bitcoin.org as fact. 
Now with that being said ... Electrum is a fine wallet.

Not quite. If it we're more subtle sure. But so glaringly obvious makes it look like a false flag. 
There is no guarantee and censorship isnt how you fight censorship

Bitcoin will be the tool of industry. Bitcoin cash the tool of consumer. 
Anything else in between that gets added obviously I can't speak to. But as of right now my statement is my feelings based on my research and experience in crypto. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:23:31
Keep on shilling that FUD. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:22:47
Turn this isn't politics if you want but the simple fact is the blockstream never intended Bitcoin to be used mainstream. They want people to make aide chains and process transactions off the chain. 
A bch tx fee is less than 20 cents. Compared to around $5-10 for Bitcoin. Yeah ok.
Keep spreading your FUD. I'm just sitting on my profits from an actually usable coin. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:29:46
If you keep changing the world micro transactions to mean higher limits then I guess that argument works. 
$10 tx? That's micro. 
$100? Micro tx you plebe
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:49:56
They we're supposed to be about adding features to the system like smart contracts and what not but with fees exceeding $10 nd constantly rising side chains are mainly only going to be used to process merchant tx at point of sale since that is what will keep generating adoption. 
Bitcoin cash is a direct to merchant and customer implementation that has the desire of having all tx be on chain. This would make the development resources required be far less than if the team had to manage and maintain their own side chain or rely on an untrusted entity to do the same. 
I own both coins. 
They both serve different purposes. 
But I also own ETH and Iota and Dash and anything else that is promising. 
Getting emotional about a particular coin and saying you KNOW it will win is arrogant at best and ignorant otherwise. 
Just stay diversified and hold a little bit more of the coin you like the tech behind the most. 
I quote myself... "This doesn't have to be Bitcoin vs Bitcoin cash"
The people in these subs that are incapable of thinking for themselves or researching this level of tech will latch onto whatever their idol is saying whether they understand it or not.

Wrong. Mempool was growing substantially before the fork. What was your excuse then
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:32:18
Bitcoin is not guaranteed the miners hash power. So no matter what you think about BCH or any other coin "Bitcoin would be working fine if half the hash power" I disagree with that. Bitcoin could have dealt with the politics better and not forced users to vote with their actions 
This is cryptocurrency and the users will do what makes the most sense hopefully. Miners will follow the profits because they aren't going to be altruistic and pay millions for hardware to not make ROI.
You seem to think the BCH hash power somehow belongs to Bitcoin. If it did, it wouldn't be in BCH

Redditor for 3 months talking shit about something they don't even understand. 
Shit isn't clogged. You are just upset blockstream isn't what you thought it was. 
This doesn't have to be Bitcoin vs Bitcoin cash. They are solving very different problems. Especially since blockstream is expecting people to maintain side chains instead of processing on chain tx. 
But you knew all that.

There is an IMMENSE benefit to paying with Bitcoin. And Everytime you pay someone that doesn't know a ton about it you teach another person. I paid my mom $20 in Bitcoin once. Now she has over $20-30k invested. Wouldn't have happened without that first $20

Let's say this is total bullshit and completely fabricated. 
It's still a feel good (fictional) story. It still tells about Bitcoin and hints that even kids are adopting it. (in real life..... Even kids are buying bitcoin.. I spoke with a 13 year old recently that is doing web development work for Bitcoin and making a good income)
It still spreads news about Bitcoin. And it creates discussion about what would be possible for that girl since "she" invested at a young age. 
The OP was creative and put some time to furthering the reach of Bitcoin. The only did you did was complain about internet points and putting a Bitcoin address out there. 
If people are nice, silly, or stupid enough to send this guy money from his unverified claims, who cares?

Then you don't get where I'm coming from. No one said they HAD to make it up for some reason. They just felt like it. 
If you would like, I can go into grave detail about how I quit my job to work full-time in crypto and travel the country in my RV.
Just because we have actual stories doesn't mean fiction isn't still useful. 
When I have to explain a complicated topic to someone, I often rely on metaphors. After an analogy or two that works well, they grasp the concept and we are all better off. This, to me, is like an analogy to help people understand the important others are putting on crypto. 
@_date: 2016-10-29 19:52:51
Point being that any gain seen in the short term can either be shadowed by larger gains to come or quickly lost.
If you are in the habit of checking the price every time you wake up, you are more likely to be investing irrationally and doing things like buying more because the price is rising or selling because it is falling. Both are silly and should be avoided when the real potential is in the long term. 
Unless you can write/find a program to automatically trade on multiple exchanges while hedging your buys/sells, you shouldn't be trying to day trade bitcoin. Therefore daily price means very little. 
No one said YOU had an emotional reaction via a thumbs up, but you definitely got personally defensive to a single comment not aimed at you so the possibility of your emotions to effect your trading are likely.

Every single exchange on that list has plans to support both coins once they can determine it is safe to do so. 
Other, larger, exchanges have already listed the future coin and are trading. ViaBTC and others have made public releases saying they will absolutely be included the new coin. 
You basically linked an article saying "we are going to list it but we have to be careful and do it right" while saying that it means they won't list at all.
