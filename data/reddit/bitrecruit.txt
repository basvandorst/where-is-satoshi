 is a "closed loop" bitcoin business. We are priced in bitcoin and spend it with bitcoin vendors for hosting and advertising. Nothing is converted to fiat. 
Hope that helps.

Nothing to stop an uber driver from also running a Bitcoin based peer-to-peer app at the same time. Extra customers and source of bitcoin for driver.

We use gourl.io and are happy with how it works. Not of use if you need to receive fiat but great for pure bitcoin situations.

Http://gourl.io is a simple solution to your need. Check out their site for sure. 
Good luck.

Thanks. It's the Talent Mining Engine behind the scenes that is the really impressive part but that's invisible unless you are a company getting great results from a job posting.

Thanks for the good wishes. It's genuinely appreciated, as is your frank response. It's a shame you have the web jobs from Indeed blocked as we put some work into the indeed filter to only show direct employer posted full time jobs so the quality is very high. 
The paid traffic we buy with the job posting fee is what eliminates the need to "draw in an audience", pointing it all directly to the specific job post. The system works as well with one job as it does with a thousand.
There are hardly any companies who hire difficult to fill IT positions using free job boards and it's our belief that the evolving bitcoin employment market is no different. It needs a site with the resources to reach out into the community to alert job seekers to opportunities where they are and that takes money. Companies spend money with job boards mostly in an attempt to avoid having to pay much higher fees to 3rd party recruiters. 
I'm confused by your bitcointalk comment, are you suggesting nearly 2 million people would see a job ad posted there? I don't even see a specific area on the home page for job posting. Even Monster and Careerbuilder combined couldn't achieve that. 
Thanks again,

Congrats on finishing the remodel. I was there during construction and its an amazing space with a great outdoor area! Bummed I'll miss the first open house but I'll be back again soon. Keep up the good work.
