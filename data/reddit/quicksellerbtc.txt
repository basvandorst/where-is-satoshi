This is probably not a good idea for a number of reasons
*You are going to want to have one backup trezor in case one fails and/or is stolen (you keep the 2nd one in an off-site location
*By allowing someone to ship you a trezor to you (or vice versa), you are allowing them to potentially tamper with your trezor, potentially compromising it, and/or swap it out with a fake trezor that will cause you to send BTC to an address controlled by the person you are dealing with

On Aug 20, 2012 (the day after the tx in question), coindesk has BTC/USD as being $10.24

No. That does not mean you should invest everything you can afford to lose, it means that the maximum you should invest is what you can afford to lose. You should not necessarily invest the max.

The coins have been long sold. 
Unless you expect the government to somehow double spend the transactions that were confirmed 1+ years ago sending the coins to the buyers, he is not getting his coins back

Is it possible to put your BTC in GBTC and then sell GBTC on the stock market?
@_date: 2015-11-26 05:45:29
You will need to sweep the private key into your wallet a second time. 
@_date: 2015-11-16 03:17:54
You should be careful to avoid spend-linking addresses together. 
Wallet explorer does not necessarily tell you all of the addresses that are in your wallet file

It is fixed, however your actual profit was never actually what it said it was when it was glitched. If you closed out your position at an advantageous price then your account would have reflected the appropriate profit.

The hashrate displayed on bitcoinwisdom (and all other sites) is just an estimate. 
It is possible that the overall network is experiencing good luck and the actual hashrate is lower

The fact that the price moved on all the exchanges almost at the exact same time means that it was most likely a single person/entity. 


I think it was very interesting just how quickly and how far the price dropped, also almost at the exact same time across all the (major) exchanges. 
I did notice on bitcoinwisdom that huobi was displaying only ~90 BTC worth of bids down to 2020 CNY not long prior to when the price dropped, so many there was some issue with the API with huobi
@_date: 2015-11-28 01:49:25
technically yes, however as you said you will not have access to your money until the replacement arrives. If you have any obligations that need to be met prior it it arriving, you may not be able to meet them
@_date: 2015-11-26 05:48:50


It seems more like that you paid for something, changed your mind and is having problems getting a refund. I would not quite call this stealing
@_date: 2015-11-11 04:49:03
right. However the speculation was previously that the chinese were using bitcoin to move money out of China and were fueling the rally. 
Do you think the recent crash had anything to do with the withdrawal problems with okcoin?
@_date: 2015-11-03 06:28:06


That is what happens when bitcoin surges 15% in one day :)
@_date: 2015-11-02 01:01:31
Unfortunately they do not appear to be rising the bid at all. The order is roughly enough to get the price up to $339 or so, assuming no one else piles on to ride the wave up

It is most likely an exchange wallet, potentially one of the chinese exchanges, but it is difficult to say for sure
@_date: 2015-10-31 16:02:36
I don't know the exact context of the sales. There are plenty of reasons why someone might want/need to sell that much BTC that have nothing to do with their belief in the long term success of bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-11-11 05:34:21
At the very least, there was a clear trend for the chinese exchanges to trade at a premium above the USD based exchanges. Regardless of the root cause behind this, the trend seems to have at least temporarily reversed.

Sobriety is against my beliefs

It is more difficult to get USD into and out of exchanges of those countries. If someone wants to sell bitcoin for fiat in order to spend that fiat for goods/services (and they plan on using USD) they will not sell on those exchanges. They will use most likely an exchange that is easier to withdraw USD from

I am not sure, however it appears to be back now
@_date: 2015-10-25 21:04:51
how much BTC are you looking to sell? 
@_date: 2015-10-29 02:00:08
This is a very bad idea. The price of bitcoin is very volatile and buying bitcoin as an "investment" is highly speculative. 
You should not purchase bitcoin with any money that you cannot afford to loose, either because of price declines of bitcoin or because of theft/scams. 
(Do I believe that bitcoin's price will rise over time, yes)
@_date: 2015-11-09 02:11:53
This is a horrible idea. Bitcoin is highly speculative and it's success is likely to be a binary event. When you are investing for something important like your child's education, you want to invest in something that is more likely to produce steady returns over time. 
@_date: 2015-11-15 03:43:11
Probably not. Especially when you are advertising the fact that you live in New York state. 
My advice is to try to get the NY bitcoin related regulations repealed and if that does not work then move to New Jersey (or another state)

That is pretty much the opposite of what they said.
@_date: 2015-10-31 15:22:20
The ownership of satoshi dice has changed a few times since it was sold in 2013(?), so you should take any previous trust they previously had with somewhat of a grain of salt. 
I have noticed that they have had a number of similar issues in recent months that each took a few days/weeks to get resolved. I suspect that their newest owner is not the most proficiently skilled in customer service so to speak, but they do not appear to be outright scamming. 
@_date: 2015-10-31 15:28:13
Last night (est), someone wanted to sell ~2,000 BTC on bitfinex quickly. Just a few minutes ago someone similarly sold around 1,500 BTC on bitstamp, both of which caused the price to quickly drop as the market absorbed these orders.   
@_date: 2015-10-31 17:39:26
No because if a tx were to get "unconfirmed" after the block that confirmed the tx gets orphaned and such tx is not included in the main chain then the tx will still be valid and will still be in the mempool, making a double spend difficult 
@_date: 2015-10-28 22:08:07
Hopefully the cost of using the ATM/Debit card will be lower then it's competitors who have sky high costs. 
Right now using a "bitcoin ATM/Debit card" makes pretty much zero sense because using one pretty much takes away all of the cost advantages of bitcoin over using Credit Cards

The "chick" could have easily been you. I am not saying that it is, however the timeframe is very suspect.

The last time we have 5 consecutive weeks of price gains was immediately prior to November 2013.....just saying 
@_date: 2015-10-28 22:17:35
I guess in terms of Bitcoin, and in terms of how the Bitcoin White-Paper was written this is accurate. The first part is less so when you consider the advent of pool mining. 
It is probably not a good idea to "invest" in any altcoins (as doing so would be considered something closer to gambling for the most part), so most other uses of the blockchain are not going to be relevant to Investopedia

There are actually a good number of companies that hire people with hacking experience to help them protect their computer systems
@_date: 2015-10-31 21:25:05
Take a look at [this thread]( and you will see why using paper wallets is a bad idea. 


In order to be protected from anything that would originate from the internet that would steal your bitcoin, you need to use a computer that has never and never will be connected to the internet, not simply one that was not connected when you generated the private keys
@_date: 2015-10-31 15:38:22
This would cause issues when there is a reorg (orphaned block(s)). If a tx were to get confirmed in the block before it were to become invalid then the receiver would believe they have safely received bitcoin, however their money would be at risk if two blocks were to get orphaned and that tx is not confirmed in the main chain. 
@_date: 2015-10-25 22:56:14
It is not the miners' job to do what is best for the network, it is the miners' job to maximize their financial performance over the lifespan of their mining equipment. 
If an address is reused but the tx still has a sufficient tx fee then it will be advantageous for the miner to confirm the tx in order to "claim" the tx fee. 
This fact will be more pronounced as the block subsidy declines over time because the miners will rely more heavily on tx fees then they are now.   
@_date: 2015-10-31 15:32:17
Trying to avoid taxes, especially in ways described in the OP is a great way to end up paying a lot more then you otherwise would need to and a great way to end up in a lot of trouble. 
@_date: 2015-10-29 04:51:43




If you were to assume the opposite of this then growth in difficulty will decline/halving as the block subsidy approaches, and the difficulty may even decline as the miners in higher electric cost areas are taken offline and those in lower cost electric areas decline to take the financial risk of purchasing the miners that are taken offline

Why don't you post the actual address that you sent to? It would probably be a little bit more help then a screenshot of the address

Are you sure that you did not send that tx to yourself just before making that tweet? The tx that spent the BTC that was unspent from that private key was first seen 7 seconds after the minute, however the tweet was made that same minute, so that means that someone would have needed to see your tweet, create, sign and push a transaction to the network all within 7 seconds.
Please note that a transaction could not have been pre-made because it was unknown what the exact amount of the input was going to be as well as the txid of the output that was going to be spent. 
IMO you were just trying to get followers to your twitter account ::)
@_date: 2015-10-31 21:26:18
how exactly does someone scam via twitter?
@_date: 2015-10-29 01:45:56
The problem with the analysis of this article is that it assumes that miners will ignore the fact that the block subsidy will half in the future until it actually halves. 
As manufacturers continue to sell mining equipment and as manufacturers continue to create new/more advanced mining equipment, people will take the fact that the difficulty will decrease during the course of a miner's useful life into consideration. 
@_date: 2015-10-31 21:29:13
This is a gamble. You will only be able to buy back 20% more BTC if the price of BTC drops 20% from when you sold it (this is ignoring the affect of taxes). If the price were to rise then you would potentially be able to buy back less BTC with the same amount of money you received from a BTC sale
@_date: 2015-10-30 06:04:10
Adoption ultimately fuels price. As more people use bitcoin they will need to 1st buy it. Although a rising price, to some extent will get more adoption, more use of bitcoin needs to come first

One small step for man, one giant leap for (the price of) bitcoin
@_date: 2015-10-31 21:35:08
The selling seems to be primarily from bitstamp and then arbs have been selling on other exchanges to pull down the price on coinbase/bitfinex. Although it appears that a few thousand BTC was sold on bitfinex across two short periods over the last 24 hours. 
The 2nd time several thousand BTC was sold on bitfinex, the BTC was sold at roughly the same time someone was selling several thousand BTC on bitstamp. 
The fact that most of the selling has been taking place on one exchange leads me to believe that the selling is being done by a single entity, and hopefully he is nearly out of BTC to sell
@_date: 2015-10-31 21:41:58
The issue is not your wallet software it is the number of unspent outputs that you have in your wallet. 
The best solution would be to create/push a transaction that sends multiple outputs to your wallet across multiple addresses that you control 
@_date: 2015-10-31 15:55:25
The issue is not so much that there is the possibility of a similarly described attack, but rather that over time, the number of utxo's will grow substantially as bitcoin adoption grows
@_date: 2015-10-26 16:08:07
The damage to bitcoin that address does is long term and will only affect bitcoin over the long term. Mining equipment on the other hand typically has a much shorter lifespan before they will become unprofitable to run. 
The fungibility issue will also only come into play if/when some entities decide to try to block certain addresses.
