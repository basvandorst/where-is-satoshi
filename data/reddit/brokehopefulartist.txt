Hello Bitcoin Community! I'm relatively new to bitcoin and have been slowly converting my currency over the past few months I just made a Changetip account and am not really sure how it works yet.... I'm also a musician and artist studying music at VCU and am working on many projects in my free time. I thought I'd share a link and to my profile and maybe get some love for a lot of hard work i've been doing, because I truly believe in Bitcoins and am trying to incorporate them more into my life.

It's very nice actually. Kind of a maple toffee taste, way better then the taste of tobacco
