The article also mentions that when he says running bitcoin he could mean  mining bitcoin. And by half the world knowing he could be refering to half the world knowing about mining bitcoin

Sure, no problem.
First you go to the wallet login page, then to the right there is a button that says "Reset Two Factor Authentication". Right above the button it says:




Click it, fill out your account info in the form. You have to make sure you provide reasonable proof in the box that asks why you are resetting the account. I provided my email address associated with the account, my old phone number, what happened(I changed numbers), then I provided my "secret phrase". Then I received an email asking if I really wanted to reset it, I clicked the link. Then it took about 3 days, but then I received an email from one of the admins saying that my 2FA reset request was approved. Then 20 minutes later I received another email notifying me that my 2FA was disabled. 
After it was disabled, I logged in and immediately re-enabled it with my new phone number.
I did the same thing with coinbase but they still want me to send them my ID. If I wanted to provide multiple forms of ID to access my money, I would just leave it in a bank.
Then they will email you to get more information.

I verified through my fucking email. It was enough to create the god damn account
@_date: 2014-06-30 23:36:37
Yeah, I won. So what? No big deal...
@_date: 2014-06-18 18:24:01
I guess I have to. I was hoping I would never have to talk to a banker again. But if I cant get my account back/disabled I am going to have to.
@_date: 2014-06-18 18:18:01
I am not denying that. It is my own fault. I am just pissed because I was able to reset my 2FA with blockchain.info without any problems, and not coinbase, a company that already has way to much information about me. They want me to scan my ID and send it to them. Fuck my privacy, let me send them my social security number and picture of my dick while im at it... At the very least I want to stop getting charged for BTC I cant even withdraw...

I've lost 3 transactions of 0.01 BTC because your system is delayed. I placed my bets for down at a specific time and counted the amount of time between the time i placed the bet a and 60 seconds after, i also allowed for a 15 second tolerance due to delays. I would have won if your system processed my transaction one minute after the time i placed the bet, instead it took about 3 minutes to receive a response and when i did i said i lost.... wtf? Can i send you some transactions to investigate? Do you keep logs of this sort of thing?

They didn't mention their no stabbing policy in their EULA... They should really be more clear about these things, otherwise I'm going go about my day normally, which means stabbing every other person I see.

thanks man!

INTJ here
@_date: 2014-05-27 17:43:01
no they don't :D good point haha thanks! Do you know if there is anyone I can contact at localbitcoins to possibly remove the ban? I can use tor as a workaround, but my work has a static IP address so unless the ban is for a certain time limit, it looks like im banned for life(at least while i'm at work and not using tor)

Where do you pull your data from? I may be wrong but i am willing to bet that this services uses legit data, but also has a bit of a random tolerance up or down. Your application appears to refresh at a very high rate, much higher than any service that i have been able to find that provides this data. So my guess is that you get real data every 5 or 10 seconds and then randomly go up or down just slightly every second until the next refresh of real data. Now if this is the case, there could possibly be some logic in the randomizing section of the code that could possibly skew the results in your favor. Or i could be completely paranoid. Could you debunk my theory or possibly elaborate on where you are pulling your data from and try to convince me that i don't have anything to worry about? That being said i am addicted to your app, i really like it, but i would like to put my cynical thoughts to rest.

@_date: 2014-06-18 18:22:32
Yeah because so many hackers are trying to cancel recurring payments. I bet they spend all day brute forcing passwords so that they can cancel recurring payments across the world.

I know, I just needed to rant so I don't slam my keyboard through my monitor and get myself fired.
I've been pretty dick-ish in this thread, but just know im really just mad at myself...

Good luck man, I hope it works out!

Lets say for a second that I am lying. Worst case scenario some random guy gets his bank and credit card account info deleted. If it is his account, he can just add it again. Lets say I am telling the truth, I get charged every month for the rest of my god damn life...
