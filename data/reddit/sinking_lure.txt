My last reply. Ok go for it then.
Yes it seems it is your vocation. Burn out is real and it's tough to switch off; it's more than just a job and it does come with an opportunity cost...And I do have some regret with my career choice. I know there's probably people younger than me, just like me, who would genuinely be happier working in another field.
Point 4; this does not reflect well on you. You are showing a character flaw here that will not serve you well if you do pursue a career in medicine but you're young so that can burn out. I have nothing to prove to you, so I won't. 
I am a good doctor but unhappy and disillusioned. I hope it works out for you.

You are naive. I am telling you this as a doctor myself. Yes maybe I am cynical now but believe me, it is not nearly as rewarding as you think, particularly in the US I should think. 
Sure some of the healthcare systems in Europe serve the people, for now, but there is a massive problem developing globally in healthcare with the greying demographics. Hospitals are massively over run and the tax system in most countries is struggling to keep it afloat; sure it's a different game in the US.
You may want to be a doctor now, but do you want to be a doctor 24 hours around the clock, unable to relax when outside the hospital and drifting away from family and friends.
The opportunity cost is massive. If you still want to do it, pick your speciality very carefully. Please heed my advice. I'm trying to help.

Spending that money on med school in the US would be a massive fucking mistake. Biggest sham in the history of the country lol. Put it in the S&amp;P work a normal job for 5 years and then retire/travel/hobbies/part time work. Time is finite and more valuable so enjoy it.

No one is in it for the tech. Anyone that says they are are full of it.
