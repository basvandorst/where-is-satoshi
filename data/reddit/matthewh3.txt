By around 2032 over 99% of all bitcoin will have been mined and distributed.  It'll then take about another 108 years for the block reward reduction to drop below 1 satoshi.

I think a factor of x10 growth in new Blockchain.info/MyWallet's does help show something.  And I added a note to the comments that should have been in the original article.  About new ways a lot of pressure during the next mega price rally.  Has many more ways to ease off now compared to the winter of 2013.  So this time quite possibly the bubbles correction won't be as severe.
@_date: 2015-06-15 15:51:37
A note was added that many of the Blockchain.info/MyWallet's will have been abandoned and that a lot of users will have multiple wallets.  It was more about showing the growth from 300,000 to 3,000,000 wallets.  And as that growth helping to represent one of the metrics of the network growth.  The network is growing and its intrinsic value is proportional to the square of that growth.  And we all know how big square numbers get as they increase.

If you're a very concerned the way Bitcoin mining is heading and especially if you're a privacy nerd or a fan of deep net projects like I2p.  Then look at -  - the mining algo is heavily CPU biased a lot more so than X11.

I help out at -  - the new UK Bitcoin ATM company and I've put it to the founder.  About potentially having bitcoin powered WiFi hotspots at each ATM location.  He is interested but there's a lot more things that needed working on more important than that right at the moment.  I really like the idea though.
Also with IEEE 802.11ah soon on its way over the next couple of years.  Then as it'll enable much further signal propagation by WiFi routers.  Potentially up to twenty miles of duplex communication with a well positioned antenna.  Then mesh-networking may really start to take off.  While your idea could be useful to reward vital and very useful nodes within a local meshnet.  Like nodes that act as gateways to the clearnet and deepnet within a larger mesh-network.

Yeah but Greece is probably the cheapest place in Europe to do so at the moment.  Plus Greece has a nice mediterranean climate.  Also being in the EU it has a proper legal system and is very likely to always stay stable.  And is a good location for international travel.  While after getting a ferry you could drive or travel by train to anywhere in Europe.  As well as it having Western levels of hospitals and healthcare near by.  Any EU national will be fully covered for healthcare in Greece.

Search the internet for stories on bitcoin by reputable sources to get your dad and Godfather to read.  Forbes online have a good few, the BBC has also wrote about bitcoin and so as the UK national newspaper The Guardian on there website.  Keep trying to prove your dad wrong.

Also try explaining to your dad there are crypto-currency stock-markets you can invest in and that you want to invest some of your coins earned.

Bitcoin mining is a very fast and changing game.  People are starting to pre-order ASIC's for mining.  You could try micro-investing in a few mining company's listed on the bitcoin stock exchange -  - most pay a weekly dividend in bitcoins.  You'll probably find all the info you need about the mining company's on this board - 
@_date: 2012-10-06 11:26:55
I like -  - as they don't store your bitcoins there held in the blockchain.  The security is as good as your password and it can back your wallet up to your email or dropbox on every transaction.  They also offer in-built ways to buy bitcoins.

Use the bitcoin address of a shared wallet like that of instawallet or of an exchange for the donations.  Then when you forward the donated coins do it in random amounts through a mixing service like that of Blockchain.info/MyWallet offers through 'send coins'&gt;anonymous.  That is about the best anonymity you can get.

They may only be 21Million coins but they are 2,100Trillion satoshi's (0.00000001) also extra decimal places could be added.  So even if there was only 1BTC to trade they would be 100Million satoshi's to play with and that's without adding any more decimal places.

At 7% weekly it only takes 11weeks to make your deposit back in weekly interest payments and this has been going longer than 11weeks. So only a late comer could loose any money. Tho with the minimum deposit being very high I'm sure a lot of people would be upset if it crumbled

The growth so far in this spike is a lot more gradual than the last one in January.  So maybe the bubble won't burst or if it does not as hard.

In the long term and if bitcoin price was to drop power consumption could be the 'be all or end all' on whether to keep large mining operations going.  I could see at =&lt;100W many 'small hobby' miners would keep on mining regardless.

With Blockchain.info/MyWallet and I'm sure there is other services too that you can send bitcoin by email.  So maybe try emailing bitcoins to - donate - and I'm sure with Blockchain.info/MyWallet if they don't take the bitcoins then you can always cancel the payment to have your funds returned (I think?).

Thanks for down voting the idea :/ but if you used LTC and provided a web based LTC miner (with rolling ads) people could just leave a browser page open to earn credits to play for money.  ANY computer can mine LTC quite well.  So people people will feel like it cost them nothing to play.  Rather than having to buy bitcoins first to play.  So you could open your game to anyone who wants to play for money and not just the bitcoin community.  You'd also get more people involved in crypto-currency's.  Lot's of young people would like the idea to earn money by playing computer games but a lot less will put their own money into it and even less would go through the process of buying bitcoins.

In the UK each bank account you hold with each different bank is insured for up to £50,000.  Also you can get an NS&amp;I government backed accounts up to £1,000,000 and that is pretty much as solid as the pound.  Tho fiat pfft you'd be daft to leave any real money in it unless it's on a inflation beating tracked rate.  Which was on offer by NS&amp;I until last year I think

I also agree with using Ripple.  It is probably the best idea for a group of that size.  Also you could all back your Ripple accounts with bitcoins.
@_date: 2012-06-29 16:53:58
You should do a version with litecoins due to it's much lower value and offer way to easily exchange or get litecoins.  You could even explain to users how they can easily mine their own LTC to play with.  So people can play without having to buy any coins.  Even my seven year old Pentium D CPU can generate over 3ltc in 24hrs.  You might get a lot more players then.  You could even embed this LTC webminer -  - on to a page with a load of ads plays could visit and leave open to generat some LTC to play with.

Hi the easiest way to put them in cold storage.  Is to use the -  - bitcoin wallet.  It will generate for you a mnemonic seed.  And all you need to do is write that seed down on some paper and store it safely.  Then you can always regenerate your bitcoin wallet using that seed you wrote down.  To do it really securely burn the TAILS OS -  - to a blank DVD.  Or set it up on a USB stick the simple way without persistence.  Then boot into the TAILS OS and it now has Electrum on it.  Every time you start the TAILS OS and use the Electrum wallet.  It will be like a brand new wallet and you can be sure that your original seed that you used for wallet.  Solely exists on the paper you wrote it on.

Online retailers can sometimes offer cheaper prices for people who pay with bitcoins.  Due to the fact bitcoins can't suffer from charge-back fraud.  This could be a big enough reason for shoppers to buy bitcoins.  Also many people and more people once bitcoin is more mature plus stable are buying bitcoins as a store of wealth.  As bitcoins are produced at a predefined rate that will only reach approximately twenty-one million.  The only unknown certainty are bitcoins demand in the future due to it still being a very new currency/commodity.  As the bitcoin project continues to grow and mature more people will put their savings into bitcoin and use it as a store of wealth.  Meaning more and more money being put into bitcoins and continuation of the growth of the bitcoin market capitalisation.

You talk about exchanges difficulties in the US well in the UK we have no access to exchanges.  Since Intersango and then MtGox Barclays shut down.  Unless you want to pay very high international transfer fees.  An exchange you could use with UK banking instant free online transfers could have at least £30Million in transactions a month.  I've read Western Union and MoneyGram* are getting interested in bitcoin.  Maybe they will offer a quick and easy way to buy/sell bitcoins but knowing those two companies with high fees probably.  They could corner the market in the UK and starting to look like the US too with the way exchanges are shutting down.
As for micro-payments the transaction fee needs to be looked at.  Like to send $0.50 (about 0.0031BTC) costs about $0.08 (0.0005BTC) at today's exchange rates.  Although lowering the transaction fee could increase blockchain bloat.

Onion routing (Tor) is slow by design while Garlic routing (I2p) is very fast.  Tor has had a hell of a lot more money and deving donated.  Garlic routing is just as secure as Onion routing but faster by inherent desgin.  The main reason Tor is more popular with the masses as it offers a very easy 'browser package'.  While I2p is a little more difficult to install as you need to download an extra browser and alter its network settings to access eepsite's.
