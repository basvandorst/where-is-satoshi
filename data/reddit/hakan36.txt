So? How does that concern you? Go make money for your family and stop throwing your shit at people on reddit.

A linguist would see them as adverb-verb or adverb-noun pairs.

It would be quicker and easier if you exchanged the btc you would like to be spending for stellar lumens. And vice versa, exchange the value you'd like to be storing back to btc.

Amazing Paint work, you're not joking kid.

This 'only bch-ers criticize lightning' is just an easy way to dismiss all counter arguments and is not really an argument at all.
And also IMO the real and constructive criticism come from people who realize how LN really works and that everything is not as shinhy as is being presented.

Yes that too of course, but his contribution is in reality beyond comprehension.

In terms of scaling nothing significant has changed in the protocol since december 2017 and we saw what happened then.

Scarcity in combination with current distribution may be a hurdle on the way towards global adoption. I mean, if bitcoin would get to be world money needed for economies to function, does someone really expect whole nations would be buying it from a few present-day whale hodlers? There's just about 15% left to mine.
edit: grammar

Good point but IMHO distribution is still a problem (even if it's just a precious commodity) when there is just 15% left to mine and vast majority of the population doesn't have any.

Yeah but LN is second layer, the only "real" bitcoin transactions (which are written in the bitcoin blockchain) are the opening and closing one.
I'm not saying LN isn't good tech, but it's a whole new thing that can't be simply equated with bitcoin protocol. The adoption of bitcoin isn't a guarantee for lightning adoption.

Confirming transactions and securing the network is just a well designed side effect of pursuing your true goal of making money.
That's the true and often overlooked beauty of the bitcoin system, it's like programming the behaviour of players based on game theory and it all leads to desired effects.

It's simply because btc is better than anything else in this particular niche. It will have to prove the same elsewhere if it's ever going to be widely used.

As I understand it, running a specific version of the client can be seen as your 'vote' for that version.

All good if you get rid of taxes, but first offer an alternative solution for financing military, law enforcement, courts, building roads etc.
