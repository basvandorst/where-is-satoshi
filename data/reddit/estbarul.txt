I really hope it doesn't keep falling and rising so sudenly or arbitrarily, I don't care about Bitcoin for making money like people do in Forex, I care about it in the long run as an established currency, and this up and down will never make people use it broadly as a currency because of the fear of losing everything.  Cryptos will never replace ordinary money imo if they can't mantain a "fixed" price in the long run.  It's waaay to unpredictable now.  That's how I see it anyway.

Yes it will! But when it happens, people will start to stay away from "investing" on it, and there is where it starts to find its "true" value on the world and adapts to where it should stand according to current currencies.  
I know people can still get rich with it, just like now with stuff like Forex, but will be a lot less and it will be actually used in the market broadly.  We'll see, I find the whole crypto currency world very intriguing and alongside AI.. a little bit worrying.

Yep, agree, I understand the tech as something really good future wise, but as way to be rich it kinda sickens me also, because just the urge to put money on it to be rich later defeats the purpose, it shouldn't be used as another currency in a Forex system, it should be sustainable, and not a bubble, when it stops dipping and raising so much, we'll have a grounded currency.

I feel like that exact quote is totally the opposite of what OP made.  I don't believe that shit either.
