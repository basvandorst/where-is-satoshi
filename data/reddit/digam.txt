I believe in the fundamentals of bitcoin and I have some in alts. I don't think the two are mutually exclusive.

As a small time hodler, I salute you. Advice like yours could be invaluable for a great many.

Why don't you just install adblock?

What is the weight of the paper used in the notebooks? They look awesome, but I also use fountain pens and I want to know how they fare.

South by Southwest, the annual film, music, and tech conference held in Austin. Lots of bitcoin stuff this year.

That's awesome you should put her on the map!

I quite enjoyed that actually. If you know some basics in french it's fine and funny. Thanks for sharing it.

This is awesome. I'm definitely tuning in for an awesome discussion.

Look at his post history. He did an ama two months ago. 
(I didn't believe at first either.)

Blockchain also has a great wallet app for android. I wholeheartedly agree that it is a simple, intuitive service.

This is a very interesting read. I've always laughed off the 51% attack, but at the back of my head it always scared me. However I believe that the network will grow so large that such an attack will be nearly impossible for almost all entities. That by the time someone wants to attack the network it will probably be too large. 
...but it's not certain and I hope that this nightmare never becomes reality.

Also on that note why would bitcoin not just fall flat to zero tomorrow? 
(Improbable, but this the kind of question I've seen)

I was about to start adding businesses to coinmap, but I realized that problem. The solution of course is that the businesses should accept BTC for dine in.

The first step is to tell them about bitcoin. Introduce them to it, explain it to them, and if it's a small brick and mortar place demonstrate it. Show how easy it is to send bits back and forth.

This looks very interesting. I'd love to see it in action.

Do you think an event like this, the failure of a bad exchange, was necessary for bitcoin to enter what you call Bitcoin 2.0 at the end of the article?
Do you think that the relatively quick stabilization of the price after MtGox's closure is a sign that the Bitcoin system is reaching a size where volatility will no longer be a problem? 
The article is well worth reading and I think it's a good summation of the MtGox fiasco. Also Pinocchio's does make great pizza.

Loving that some politicians don't simply go off emotional knee jerk reactions and actually do research. Bravo Mr. Polis.

Good article, worth a read. I'd point to it if I was trying to convince a merchant to accept BTC, it nicely lays out the advantages.
