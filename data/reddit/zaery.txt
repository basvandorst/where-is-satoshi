No, that's coinbase's expiration time, and it borked.
@_date: 2018-03-14 04:11:31


The "or" in that sentence means they literally don't know if it'll be a refund or a completed transaction. So saying that the merchant actually got the money is you predicting the future.
See if you can find a single sentence that implies that the merchant got the money. That's the closest one I could find, and it definitely doesn't say that the merchant got the money.
@_date: 2018-03-14 14:04:58


He's talking to Coinbase support, they have his BTC. They(Coinbase support) are deciding whether to process the transaction and send the merchant the USD or to refund him and send him the BTC back. A BTC refund would mean a new transaction with a new transaction ID, in the correct amount, sent to the customer(the other bullshitter). It has nothing to do with working on the block-chain.
I asked because we've already been over these details, but I'll reword them to see if you'll understand this time.
TID is very literally irrelevant. It says **nothing** about who received the BTC because Coinbase uses unique addresses for each transaction and only Coinbase and the person who made the purchase(us bullshitters!) would know if it's their address. Additionally, Coinbase only sends USD to the merchant(I think they do allow merchants to accept all/some of the BTC instead, but that's beside the point). The transaction id would tell you **nothing** about whether or not the merchant has the money, even if you could get Coinbase confirmation that it's their address. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 21:54:40


That attitude of distrust is exactly the problem. If either of us provided a transaction ID, you would have just said that we just browsed the blockchain to find a random one that's around the right timestamp.
@_date: 2018-03-14 00:44:28
Are you blind or do you have amnesia? In my screenshot, that big red box pretty clearly said "This order expired", and I did say a couple times that me and him are in the same situation. It's not about waiting, Coinbase's service literally said that it didn't work.

I was responding to this part: 


Since it's clear that you didn't understand the text in the screenshot well enough to know that the transaction didn't work fine and patience was irrelevant, I tried to pick a different angle, and that's too complicated I guess, so back to just what's in the screenshot:


That sentence clearly shows that he did enough research to know that it's not segwit related, and that it is a real problem. If it wasn't a real problem, he'd link [this article]( and maybe a short explanation about it. So back to your question that I quoted in this post, it didn't work fine, and patience was irrelevant.

No, the bullshitter(who doesn't exist, not even the other guy) would find a transaction first, then fix up a screenshot to match. And then if he's smart, provide the screenshot before the transaction ID to throw you off the scent.

I only use it to make purchases on sites like Overstock. But today, I made a purchase and almost 8 hours later, Overstock has the wrong amount of money and I have an email saying that they're investigating.

Doesn't sound like you were mining in a pool, so you must have made a multiple of 50BTC(could be 0). If it was early 2011, there's a good chance a laptop for two days was good enough to get 50. But if it was late 2012, I highly doubt it.

Well, you might be right about that, but since it's a lot of vague marketing bullshit instead of details, I have no idea. Eve has corporations and contracts, but apparently you're doing it "at a lower level", which must be better.


The vast majority of items are manufactured by players and sold to players. If you really want to get anal about "everything in the game world" having natural value, you're wrong about voidspace too, because there will be some stuff in game that is handed to players when they start. And if you think something that's given to everyone for free has natural value, then I don't know what to say to you.


Like what? The only need in Eve that I can think of that is defined by developers is the need for money. And from what I can see, void space is all about money.


Yes, you fucking can ignore NPC's and play a very rich game. Make money by transporting goods for other players, scamming other players, mining and selling to other players, market manipulation, refining goods for other players, manufacturing stuff for other players and that's not even an exhaustive list. Then with that money, you can buy ships from other players and join fleets of hundreds of players to go shoot other players. All of that can be done entirely without NPC interaction. It sounds like you're trying to sell me on a lack of NPC's rather than a richness of player-to-player experience, and that's ridiculous.

Again, the same as Eve. You can completely ignore NPC's and get a very rich experience. 


I don't know all of your details, but no two characters in Eve are the same because of the amount of skills. Sure, each specific skill is the same across the population, but the combination of skills is the important bit.


Again, I don't know all the details, but in Eve basically the only way two ships are the exact same is when you coordinate your fits with other players. And for specific equipment, it depends on the ship you're using, your character's skills, your character's implants, the other equipment on the ship, possibly who's in your fleet, and what drugs you're on.
I get that there's going to be some amount of bias and that's ok, but this just seems dishonest.
