Didn't realise this was still going!

on OSX and iOS I use the [Money]( app. I just added a cash account and set it up as a new currency, then input the exchange rate, and it lists my BTC finances against my GBP. Works pretty well. Only thing is I have to manually input my bitcoin transactions.

Will it not get a bit humid near the washing machine and dryer?

Unlikely. Two examples given by Jacob Appelbaum show that security researchers have rediscovered 0-day exploits and attack methods used by the NSA.
See [at 45:57, Jacob talks about the HDD firmware implant that was recently rediscovered by Sprite_tm]( ([Sprites writeup is here]( and at [47:03 Jacob talks about MONKEYCALENDAR, another exploit previously discovered]( although I can't find the talk or report on it at this time.
EDIT: [Karsten Nohl's write-up is here](

Think it counts as capital gains, though if you convert to sterling, I guess you'd pay tax as normal.

It uses the wallet you store on blockchain's servers, so no private keys are stored on the device as far as I know. No jailbreak required.

You do know he's a big angel investor, right? He's pretty clued up.

I'm not sure what you're implying. They could be 100% reliable because of the backdoors.
@_date: 2013-12-31 17:29:32
Yep, they state in ioerror's slides that they were working on remote exploitation on that date.

And the more, the merrier!

At the time of the publication of those slides. Most likely no longer the case, as they mentioned working on remote exploitation in 2008.

For a company like Mastercard, that troubles me.

That's not *why* they can compromised. The NSA claims a 100% success rate, either because Apple left deliberate backdoors or because they have 0-days that jailbreakers are publicly (re)discovering.
