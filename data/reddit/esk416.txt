yes I've closed and opened the program many times since that transfer... Today was the first time I attempted to pay for something with BTC from MB and it told me I didn't have the funds.  So I just noticed now that my other BTC are unconfirmed.
I ran a Repair on my wallet, that didn't help either.

I just noticed really that on the left it shows BTC in large letters, that is what is available to me.  On the right it shows my unconfirmed balance.
I'm not trying to send all of it, I am trying to send more than I have "confirmed" and that's why the transaction didn't go through.  Which is fine I understand why.
I don't understand yet why my other transaction didn't get updated in my wallet correctly.  I'm hoping their tech support can help me work through it.

After speaking with Multibit support, it ends up that this happened due to a bug in Multibit wallet.  They're looking for a way to fix it.
On their recommendation, I rebuilt my wallet using another wallet (in this case breadwallet) and voila all my coins were accessible!
Thought I'd update in case someone else has this issue.
Either way, it's impressive how this all works with the bitcoin network!

after setting up the wallet, it asked to set a passcode (4 digit).  That passcode doesn't seem to work after.  I reset the wallet, same thing happened.
When I go to change the fingerprint limit, it just keeps asking for the set passcode in a loop, it never stops.  I hit cancel and go to change passcode and it tells me the wallet is locked.
