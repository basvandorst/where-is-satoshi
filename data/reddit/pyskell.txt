Other Cryptocurrencies are relatively secure as well. There's no more risk on Litecoin or Bitcoin Cash or Ethereum or many others.
Edit: highly -&gt; relatively

IOTA I think is unlikely to achieve the decentralization and scaling they want because the network topology seems very flat to me. Although I admittedly don't know or understand DAGs.
RaiBlocks I don't know know anything about.

Is the code for this somewhere? Ideally with comments/variable labels but even if it's just a contract address that would suffice.
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:45:03
Wait. What? My private keys need to be on an internet-connected computer in order to use Lightning Network?
Can anyone confirm if this is true? Wouldn't I only need them when transacting?

This is amazing and you're amazing for it! I'd suggest getting a well known fiduciary to invest some of this money in stable assets so that you can give sustainably over the long term.
$86 million can easily become a lot more.

Okay so support is possible then for hardware wallets and other cold storage?
Otherwise to use my Lightning Wallet on a phone I'd need to pay the normal Bitcoin transaction fees to move it first?
@_date: 2017-12-25 15:31:31
Agreed, hardware wallet/offline signing is fine. Always needing to be online with it is not.

They have large amounts of hash power.
But in reality, none are safe. Most Cryptocurrencies can be taken over with a couple acquisitions. Buy 2 or 3 pools and you can take over a Cryptocurrency. Bitcoin included.
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:07:16
I think Lightning Network/offchain scaling is the only way to have a Cryptocurrency at scale. But I do agree this particular approach is very risky and likely will not work.

Are there stats on specific software versions anywhere? I'm curious to see how frequent nodes upgrade their bitcoin core software without any major changes.
I also realize it's not the only software that needs to be updated but it would be a nice piece of information to have.
Edit: Found some data. Haven't crunched the numbers but it seems most update frequently but there's a long tail of old clients.

I was just trying to say that 2MB Segwit blocks wouldn't be any more CPU-intensive to process than 1MB non-Segwit blocks. So there's no issue of centralization with Segwit2x in my mind. And thus Segwit2x is a good idea to alleviate tx fees.
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:21:17
All nodes are part of consensus. They can and do reject blocks that do not follow the rules. Miners just decide who gets put in a the next block.
The reason everyone doesn't collectively decide on transactions is that scaling it is hard. Every node needs to negotiate transaction validity with every other node. If you have 10k nodes that's 10k^2 negotiations per transaction. So you need more hierarchy (such as PoW). You also have an issue where people start operating nodes to try and influence the network or attack it. So PoW gives you one way to negotiate consensus with less overhead and less attack surface.
That being said PoW is not the end-all be-all final say in how to achieve consensus. What you're describing is probably best implemented by Ripple/Stellar at the moment. These are federated networks with some trusted servers doing consensus and the rest of the network functioning much like regular non-mining nodes on Bitcoin. Though there's valid complaints about centralization here.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:08:01
Not only that but Segwit improved the transaction validation formula.
It was O(n^2 ), now it's O(n), that's a huge gain and in a typical usage scenario a 2-4MB cap on Segwit blocks would be about the same as O(n^2 ) on the old non-Segwit blocks.
What that means is larger Segwit blocks really only cost hard drive space, which is already abundant, and wouldn't require faster hardware in terms of CPUs.
There's no centralization risk to a mild increase to Bitcoin transaction size to keep the network operating healthily until Lightning networks are not only available but used.
Keeping the blocksize the same with Segwit is silly. Enlarging the blocksize without Segwit is also silly. Segwit2x would have fixed these issues.
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:49:12
That sounds like a good way to reduce risk but honestly if I need to do more than 15 mins of setup for this I probably won't. 
Really it should all work from my end the same as always. I should be able to send BTC the same as I do today and not even need to worry about what the topology is that gets my transaction broadcast.
If it doesn't I will probably just use other Cryptocurrencies. Laymen will simply give up their private keys and Bitcoins to others (like they already do).
But I do really hope that this all gets down to a couple button presses. Otherwise I can't see the masses using it.
I also sincerely doubt any always-online server will remain secure no matter how much you harden it. Especially when the incentive to break into it is so high.
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:01:54
Well they scale pretty well to 1.5k transactions per second so far. Though that is a bit experimental and doesn't reflect actual utilization yet. Their validation nodes only talk to each other for consensus and regular nodes handle the rest of the scaling.
There's no blockchain for Ripple as well, it's just a ledger so it doesn't need to keep history to work. Just need the latest entry. But if you want to keep the whole transaction history it does measure in terabytes.
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:29:08
I really don't think fees will drop that low. Especially with increased adoption. Segwit is only a 2-4x increase in transaction throughput. 
Either I need a way to safely use Lightning Network without a live wallet or I need super low transaction fees. If everyone needs to periodically move pocket change to a live wallet then there's still going to be high transaction fees.

Bitcoin Core's Segwit soft fork is ONLY a soft fork because they put the code in years ago. Leaving it to just be activated when miners signal. The same exact thing could have been done to make 2MB blocks a soft fork but Core resisted that for as long as Segwit has been a thing. 
Even more so their current Segwit implementation is basically 1.6MB blocks. The Witness data is stored in the same exact data structure as it always has been and is hardly segregated yet. The Core node just doesn't count it when calculating block size and no longer requires it be present to validate a block. A later fork may actually segregate it and allow it to be sent separately from the rest of the block.
This is all far more political than technical and because no one wants to work together the community is being divided when it absolutely does not need to be.    
@_date: 2017-08-19 16:35:12
I'd be surprised if miners didn't do that. I mean futures markets themselves came about from commodity producers wanting to protect themselves from seasonal price fluctuations. Same motivations should apply here.
@_date: 2017-08-19 16:42:38
As others have mentioned you can sell a short. You agree with someone else to sell whatever your block reward is to them in the future at something close to today's price minus a percentage for the risk the buyer is taking on.
You're locking in your revenue and the buyer is betting that the price is going to stay the same or increase.
@_date: 2017-08-18 23:50:03
ASIC mining hardware does the number guessing for PoW. Nodes do the block processing and transmission.
There's no appreciable difference between Segwit, Segwit2x, or Bitcoin Cash when it comes to mining. You just swap out your node software and you're good to go. Your ASIC hardware does not become worthless.

The article talks about SegWit2x only briefly in the conclusion and mentions it as the solution that should have been sought. The rest of the article solely discuses SegWit / 2MB.


I've not seen any numbers saying SegWit alone will increase effective block size to between 1-4MB. Can you share this? Witness data is about 60-70% of any given transaction on average so you'd expect an effective increase of 60-70% throughput.


SegWit2x is a 2MB block increase on SegWit blocks, it is about doubling the size of 1MB SegWit blocks, it doesn't mention going beyond that. The original agreement is [here]( and was based on the proposal [here](


If Witness data is part of the block and every SegWit transaction just as before (which I agree is the current implementation). Then, assuming blocks are at capacity, how are you getting more transactions inside a 1MB block SegWit block than before? 
If all the data is there, both the transaction, and witness data, and the block is 1MB then wouldn't the amount of transactions per block possible via SegWit be the same as the non-SegWit blocks?
As for the 1.7MB blocks I'm getting that information from the [BIP-141 abstract]( where it says Witness data is stored in the same Merkle tree, which then logically means it has to be included in each transaction and block. SegWit may eventually move away from this but right now if you're including Witness data in blocks, same as before, and achieving higher throughput, then your block size must be bigger.
The Witness data, while present, no longer gets processed, that's what I meant by "ignored", and that's what takes the algorithm for verifying blocks from O(n^2) to O(n), but the data is still there in the blocks.

8% a year is an awfully high draw down rate. 3-4% is what most people consider secure so you should cut all your numbers in half.
You want to balance out your 8-10% gain years with your 3-4% loss years. And weather the abrupt 20% loss years...which is also when you'll want some liquid capital to buy back in at a discount.
Anyway you seem interested in this stuff and if you're not already subscribed I suggest you check out and @_date: 2017-05-07 17:39:15
But it's not a Fiat Currency in the US. It's just a Currency here and if I have some I can trade it but the US government doesn't back it. We agree on all these things and I'm not concerned with who is right.
All I'm saying is that like a foreign currency, Bitcoin is also a Currency. The governing body for it, however, is not a nation, it's a protocol with a majority of the participants agreeing on the rules of exchange. Which, honestly, is how nations largely work in the general sense. And like any other Currency its value is mediated by supply and demand.
Wikipedia's articles on Currency and Digital Currency support this specific definition, as well as your more general definition. In fact the rest of the article on Currency deals with Fiat Currencies only and non-Fiat Currencies are relegated to other articles.
You and I both also agree that Apples are not a Currency. They're a commodity, they have a value and can be traded. But one apple may not have the same value as another. They're hard to store, they depreciate in value over time, they have an intrinsic value in that you can eat them for their calories. I think we'd agree that all these aspects make them not a Currency.
@_date: 2017-05-07 17:02:37
Yes I agree with all of that. Bitcoin and Canadian dollars are both not Fiat currencies in the US. But they are currencies.
@_date: 2017-05-07 15:57:49
Literally every currency we have only has value because we give it value. Fiat currencies do not have any intrinsic value other than we all agree they're worth something.
Not sure why ability to pay taxes with a currency is the litmus test for value. I have some Canadian dollars and coins. I can't use those to pay my taxes either.

Thanks for answering my questions. So there is still a signature/part of the transaction that shows the miner verified the inputs/outputs? Is there a phrase or BIP for what this part is?
@_date: 2017-05-07 18:42:35
Fungibility is super relevant to a functioning currency. If my $1 USD isn't equal to your $1 USD then using them to trade is very hard.
@_date: 2017-05-07 04:45:59
Currencies and commodities and anything that has value to more than one person are all basically the same thing.
In Bitcoin's case though it's much closer to a currency since it's fungible and only has the value people give it.
@_date: 2017-07-30 16:23:41
Okay, so here's the part I don't completely understand.
Miners currently sign each transaction themselves and as I understand it this signature provides easily verifiable proof that the miner validated the transaction.
But with the witness data moved out of the block then a miner can lie and say they validated the transaction when they didn't. No? Or are they required to still broadcast the witness data on the network? 
If it's the latter then what happens if a miner  ends up on the longest chain, and 10 blocks later broadcasts some invalid witness data?
@_date: 2017-07-13 01:05:06
Not really, compared to lots of other markets cryptocurrency in general is tiny. The total market (Bitcoin + others) moves $4 billion per day.
Compare that to something like Forex which moves trillions per day.
The large price on Bitcoin just looks scary because there's only about 16 million Bitcoins in existence, so they're rare. 
Just keep in mind that it's a bear market right now though so price is probably going to drop in the short term.

You don't want to keep them on your computer either. You want a hardware wallet to store them. It's a little USB device that keeps your wallet completely disconnected from the rest of the world except when you want to spend your coins.
There's currently three companies making these: Trezor, Ledger Wallet, and KeepKey.

This is a good place to start: 
And yes, you're correct, Bitcoin and other crypto currencies have no central governing body. That's definitely one of the reasons the price fluctuates rapidly. There's also high scarcity, many speculative investors, and a relatively small market (~$90 billion across all crypto currencies right now).
