Today an error in CoinMarketCap caused the website to display wrong prices for crypto. BTC shot upto $8500 and lot of other smaller coins was 10x the price and then everything came crashing down after a few minutes.
Looks like the price page on Humble Oracle didn't have any errors, plus it gives you a nice Tradingview graph for bitcoin. I've been using it regularly to check prices of crypto :

BTC shot upto $8500 and lot of other smaller coins was 10x the price and then everything came crashing down after few minutes.. And it happened exactly when the news that NYSE is starting Bitcoin futures and Starbucks is going to start accepting crypto payments. Both very good news..  Anyway, so lot people must have thought that was the actual price.
