Good points. Easy to understand even for a newbie like me.

What app is this?

I couldn't agree more. Please stop with the divisive rhetoric. While there might be some players with ill intentions, most of us just want whats best for bitcoin. Even if we don't always agree on what that is, we shouldn't consider ourselves enemies. I hate the increased toxicity I have felt coming from everywhere lately. We should try to reason with each other to solve the challanges facing bitcoin in a productive manner.

Thanks! I was against the way 2x was conducted. But you guys handled it the right way in the end, and I respect you for that. Im sorry for other peoples toxicity, they don't speak for all of us.

Swede here. Im not saying its bullshit, but I haven't heard about this before. This is not something that is discussed at all in the public forum. Yes, we are moving towards a cashless society rapidly. But I haven't even heard any officials even mention that bitcoin would be a viable replacement as a currency. I don't know if I've heard any officials talk about bitcoin period. Fake news.

I'm also a little confused about these things. And the totally contradictory comments here doesn't make it any easier :/

I bet the finish line was at the moon

If it would happen, alot of people would have probably known already and the price would have gone up before hand. Like with the China "ban", bitcoin tanked before the it was known publicly.
