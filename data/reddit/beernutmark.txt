We'll check back with you in a few weeks and see how you still feel. Oh, wait... Then you will say that you are in bitcoin for the long term and thus daily swings are irrelevant. 
Unless, you already sold. Then you made a good/lucky speculative trade and props are warranted.

How is that an argument for using, AKA SPENDING, bitcoin? That *might* be an argument against holding dollars but a recent chart of bitcoin value would be an equally good argument for not holding bitcoin.

No they don't.  I drive a Focus Electric and there are no added sounds.  Dead quiet until road noise kicks in at speed.  It's one of my favorite things about the car.  You do have to pay extra attention to peds though.

Not sure why you are getting down voted.  I have a Ford Focus Electric and there is no added sound whatsoever.  The silence is one of my favorite parts of the car.

This is exactly why you should be regularly rebalancing your portfolio.  
Figure out what percentage of your investment portfolio you want to keep speculative, mid cap, large cap, international, etc and stick to that. Then regularly readjust to keep your percentages on target.
When one of your investment classes moves higher, for whatever reason, you sell off the gains and move the investment into one of the ones in temporary decline.
Repeat this process at regular intervals and you keep yourself from becoming emotional and falling into investment traps.

So, you are recommending that the "average American" use a beta currency because perhaps when it hits full release it will have some benefits regarding monetary policy?

Bitcoin could never handle that volume.  It *might* be able to scale to Visa/MC levels (I doubt it) but to cover the entire US economy? No way.  Thus, the US economy will continue to revolve around USD.  I would bet on dollars being around a lot longer than bitcoin.

The most important question missing from the FAQ is: 
Q: "If this is really a working method of making money off bitcoin then why aren't you keeping it to yourself and making lots of money instead of selling the software?"  
A: "It isn't."

Is there any way to see how many wallets are actively used vs how many have never made a transaction?
@_date: 2014-04-11 16:59:44
If it is really a currency then staying away at this point will not affect it's value as a currency to us hold outs in the future.

Curious what your definition of "stops falling" is. Markets are volatile, bitcoin doubly so.  
The price also stopped falling in January where it went up to about 900.
It stopped again in June where it made it back to just under 700.
It stopped falling in July where it made it back up to about 650.
And now it has stopped falling and is at about 375.
I'm not sure "stopped falling" means what you think it means.

Don't forget that there are other options for investing as well. Almost all of them are far less risky with a much better historical track record.  It's not bitcoin vs cash, it's bitcoin vs all other investment options.  For me I see much more value having my investments in index funds.
Today just wiped out all your profits and then some.  For 99% of us, investing should be BORING.  Bitcoin is certainly fun theater but it really shouldn't be much of anyone's investment portfolio.

You are completely wrong. You might want to look at [this chart] ( for some real facts.  It never recovered back what was lost after the silk road and sheep fails.  It is still way below what it was.  You "want" it to head back to 300 but there is no reason for it to do so.

Which two times and what were the prices at the "top" each time?

Seems to me that your original post and most of your comments suggest that it doesn't even require a central authority or even a government or major power to manipulate bitcoin.  All it takes are a few 10's of millions of dollars. Lots of people/corporations have that.  
Why is the possibility of manipulating "regular" markets more worrisome than your strong belief that bitcoin is actually being manipulated even without a central authority being involved? Seems to me that if the goal is to avoid an easily manipulated currency then bitcoin is failing in that measure.
EDIT: Sorry I am mixing up my threads.  My comments about manipulation are related to [this thread]( and not your's. Still, going to leave my comment as I think that the concerns about other investment vehicles being manipulated while bitcoin isn't is worth thinking about.

Yeah, lucky guy. He's only down 60% since the sale. But eventually he will be owning an island so who cares.
Well, he could have put the money into an index fund like Vanguard's total stock market fund. It was trading at 38.97 when he sold his house and is at 53.43 today.  He would be up $158,692.66 with the index fund but instead he is down $259,200 with bicoin (at today's price of $260).
Add it up and he would be $417,892 USD better off than he is now if he had put his money into a safe total market fund.

And "they" have managed to pull off this downward manipulation for over a year how exactly?
@_date: 2015-03-24 16:41:09
With  ~70% of all the bitcoin that will ever exist [already in the marketplace](
and most of that bitcoin simply being [hoarded in wallets]( and not used for any transactions whatsoever, how exactly is Bitcoin going to prevent "big money" from overwhelming any "bitcoin sentiment?"
I'm not saying that this is what is going on but, if you believe that it is, what exactly is going to ever change to make bitcoin stable enough for use as a currency?

Google "trezor hack" also

These may also be old new, not sure. Don't follow hardware wallets much at all. But they are all from 2018
