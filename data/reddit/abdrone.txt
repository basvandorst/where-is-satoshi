oh man what throwback. I need go and re read that masterful chat log. 
@_date: 2014-05-14 18:59:23
This is the an excellent summary on the reality of the issue. Nicely expressed.
@_date: 2014-11-24 21:01:30
Fuck off
@_date: 2014-05-30 16:14:29
Exactly what I plan to do. That option makes the most sense.
@_date: 2014-04-19 13:50:46
Thanks for compiling this. Useful reference list.

Censor: "to examine in order to suppress or delete anything considered objectionable"
Whether something is voluntary or not does not bear on whether it is considered censorship or not. An author could self censor, for instance, in an effort to tone down his/her content because it is less likely to be published.
In any case, the website is censoring comments they deem objectionable (i.e, comments that paint them in a bad light.)

To clarify, it makes the most sense for me personally at this moment based on my valuation and the amount I've put in. It isn't that I don't anticipate that BTC will grow, but the investment I've put in so far is a decent percentage of my savings. Even if the expected utility is less by taking the option I mentioned rather than waiting it out, it is still positive utility, just with a "safety" cushion, if you will.

Much thanks! Now that these bits are associated with my reddit account, how can I add them to my existing coinbase wallet?
Edit: Ah nvm, I see the account info for changetip. Cheers mate.

Best response. I will be using this to respond to all the idiots who use science as a euphemism for masturbation. It's retarded.

Mr. President, 
How does one go about applying to be part of such an esteemed council? What are the criteria?
@_date: 2014-08-16 23:51:12
Nothing says transparency like censorship.

OP is a damn genius for this.
The BTC may be going down for now, but I'm definitely feeling a rise coming soon 
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
@_date: 2015-01-14 05:43:41
That answer drove me up the wall. What a unbelievably shitty mindset. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 05:44:49
OP missed out. This was the time to strike
