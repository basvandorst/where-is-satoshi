Bitcoin is the original decentralized cryptocurrency, which alone makes it stand out from the rest of the rabble, which are basically just clones of it. It's not just another cryptocurrency, like all the altcoins are.
There's nothing that altcoins can do that Bitcoin won't be able to do, except for becoming inflationary or centralized perhaps. Technology is cheap, and can be copied. Trust, security, user base and brand name recognition however, takes time to build. You don't just switch payment platform the same way you get a new smartphone every year, because something new and better is available. You build and improve on what you've already got. While altcoin shills are busy trash talking Bitcoin, Bitcoin is out there in the front line, fighting all the problems that their shitcoins would have faced too if they had been large and important enough.

Bitcoin is not a ponzi scheme for the simple reason that it has real utility, or at least will have, (in remittance, for the unbanked, for merchants who want to save fees etc.) and solves real problems in people's lives (gatekeeping banks, having to use currencies they don't trust etc.). Ponzis, or pyramid schemes, however, always just sell some worthless shell product or service, for appearances' sake, when the real profits are just from new people buying in.
Now, 99% of the price today may be derived from speculation only, but in the case this blows up, it will be because Bitcoin was in a bubble, not because it was a ponzi scheme. Ponzis and bubbles have many similarities, but are not the same. For one, ponzi schemes are intentional and have someone facilitating them to scam people from their money, while bubbles form organically. Ponzis are also very centralized, at least historically.

* How will LN alleviate today's on-chain fees if you constantly have to move money back and forth between your "hot wallet" and cold storage? Wouldn't there be MORE transactions in the mempool, not less? More than 90% of transactions today are probably just people moving money to, from and between exchanges and their wallets. Not the coffee transactions that this is supposed to deal with.
* If the system is trustless, why do you need to have a cold storage? Can't all your bitcoins just stay in the hot wallet indefinitely, saving you fees and saving the chain from congestion? Why should this only be used for small transactions, and not for large transactions between you and an exchange for example? I could see there are certain situations where you'd want your bitcoins to be in your own private addresses, like before a fork ("dividends"), during times of turmoil, or if you were going to leave the money there for a long time, not paying much attention to it, for peace of mind. But constantly moving money back and forth?

Quite possibly too late. Bitcoin market share is at an all-time-low and dozens of altcoins have seen 50%+ daily gains for the last week. This insane altcoin growth is probably ignited by market manipulation and fueled by the recent influx of noobs to the crypto community. It's almost bound to come crashing down again soon.
If I hadn't sold all my altcoins for BTC months ago, I would, like OP, have found this to be the perfect time to do so.

Yes, I think that Bitcoin is worth *at least* $7.7 trillion, which would put the price of a single Bitcoin at $366,000. It's probably worth a lot more. The reason is that the the value of all the world's gold today is $7.7 trillion. Bitcoin has a lot of the same properties as gold, while at the same time being better at them and having more possible use cases, leading me to believe it it will surpass gold as a store of value.
* Both Bitcoin and gold are scarce. But opposed to gold, miners can't just mine more bitcoins when the price goes up. With gold, if the the price goes up, opening more mines becomes profitable, keeping the value of gold down.
* Bitcoin is easier to transport
* Bitcoin is easier to secure
* Bitcoin is harder to seize
* Bitcoin can't be forged
* Bitcoin is easier to divide 
* Bitcoin is more fungible. A bitcoin is a bitcoin. With gold there are different grades and quality.
Bitcoin has other use cases than as a store of value. Bitcoin will only need to grab a small percentage of the market share of these applications to greatly increase in value:
* In remittance. International wire transfers today suck hard.
* For the unbanked, which makes up a significant share of the world's population
* For citizens of countries where the local currency can't be trusted, like Venezuela, India and Zimbabwe.
* For people in countries where cash is being done away with. This is coming.
* For merchants who simply just want to save Visa and Mastercard's transaction fees
* For people who want privacy and financial freedom. Bitcoin has no gatekeepers.
A 25x increase in value is a lot, but it has happened many times before in Bitcoin's history. The price has already increased 60x since I bought my first bitcoin at $220 in February 2015. Of course the growth will have to slow down eventually since the world is finite, but at this time there's still plenty of room for massive growth.

Bits is short and simple, which is great for people who are already initiated and understand the term. We still need to build and improve on brand name recognition though, so I suggest that exchanges, wallets, merchants and tickers should use µBTC, or microBTC (because of the inaccessible µ) as the default denomination of bitcoin. µBTC, or "micro bitcoin", could be the official name of the unit, while bits is the informal short hand term. Similar to how a one cent coin is called a penny in the US.
One problem with using a smaller unit as the default denomination of BTC, is that people could be lead to believe that Bcash or other altcoins are the real deal, or are more valueable, when their price per "coin" is higher. This is perhaps just a short term problem though, that would soon be shaken off.
I'm bullish on the price, so I think I'd prefer µBTC to mBTC at this point, but I'm happy with either denomination, as long as we start using a smaller denomination soon.

There has to be credit in the world. The optimism, the belief that tomorrow will be better than today, is what has caused unprecedented growth since capitalism and the large scale introduction of credit was invented. In the largest part of human history, people were generally pessimistic. We've had our golden age, they thought, but now it's getting worse, because there are more people to compete for the same scanty resources. Noone would lend the baker money to open a bakery if they didn't believe he could pay it back with interest. And the only way the baker could do just that was if people were willing to buy his breads, which required optimism from the lender's and baker's part, and would be made easier by credit and growth in the baker's community. Credit and growth is a chicken-and-egg kind of thing.
The question is, can we build a system of credit on top of Bitcoin, or will that be meaningless or down-right impossible? With no inflation it will be harder, not easier, for people to pay back loans, causing pessimism. I think Bitcoin can't stand alone as a currency in the world, but only as a supplement to inflationary ones. When there in 2140 are no longer new bitcoins issued, it could end up mostly as digital gold, not an effective cash system.

Some initial and finalizing transactions on chain will still be unavoidable, even with LN. Whether the on chain fees will be higher, lower or the same as today, I do not know. Fees will depend solely on how much people value having their transactions permanently and safely written on chain. I think, though, that for the average user, LN will be mostly a hidden feature. Your wallet will have LN, but it automatically decides everything for you. It just works.
As LN adoption grows, on chain fees could get lower, because many transactions that today would be on chain will move to LN instead as people will want to save fees. On the other hand, with LN, Bitcoin will get a lot more utility, which could greatly increase Bitcoin adoption among merchants, in remittance etc. The larger user base may offset the transactions removed from today's blocks, and the on chain congestion could possibly get even worse than today. Even then, we still have crude block size increases left in our arsenal of ways to scale Bitcoin.
I think we could collectively be paying in total about the same in fees as today, but with almost limitless transactions. I.e. the average fee per transaction is greatly reduced. Microtransactions will again be viable.

The transaction capacity of Bitcoin is only 4-10 transactions per second today. That's measly to say the least, and the reason Bitcoin transactions are so slow and fees so high. Bitcoin today is useless for everyday transactions, so its utility is limited. With sophisticated technology LN can increase the capacity of Bitcoin to millions of instant transactions per second at close to zero fees. There aren't even any drawbacks, because LN is just a layer on top of the Bitcoin network, and is completely voluntary to use. Noone, not even miners, can block you from using LN, because it is the equivalent of just keeping tabs (albeit safer) between you and those you transact with.
If LN does what it promises, and gets successfully implemented and widely adopted, I predict that the price of Bitcoin will continue to skyrocket with 5x+ yearly gains the next couple of years. LN has been grossly undersold, so I suspect the price today doesn't reflect Bitcoin's true value. I suspect that most people in crypto today hardly know anything about LN, and probably think that the fees and transaction times will remain like they are today. The ignorance is even worse among people who have never even used bitcoin.

Currently you need at least about 120 GB free space on your hard drive, but as blocks keep getting added to the chain you'll need more space. Though I think you can run the node in pruned mode at a lot lower space requirement.
That's the danger of "unlimited" blocks. We private individuals may run out of disk space, or even bandwidth, faster than we can add more, and in the end only large powerful companies like Coinbase will be running full nodes, centralizing the network.

To answer your question: Yes, there was "mini crash" earlier today where the bitcoin price fell to $1180 before quickly recovering. It was all over in like 15 minutes. I'm not sure of the cause of the mini crash, but I think it had to with breaking news, either from PBOC or about Antpool mining Bitcoin Unlimited blocks.

One of the great reasons for investing in btc is its potential for growth. Many people think $7,000 is high, but they probably don't realize that at $100 billion market cap bitcoin is still tiny. That's only about 1/8 of the value of Apple's stocks. The potential for growth for such a revolutionary technology is still huge.
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:59:41
If people headlessly invest in Bitcoin simply because the price is going up, without any regard to what it is and what it can be, it certainly is a bubble. And it might be that a lot of people do just that, especially around these times when Bitcoin sets all time-highs and reaches new milestones and therefore attracts a lot of media attention. Bitcoin does however have lots of strong use cases for the future, which a lot of speculation also is based on: 
* in remittance
* for the unbanked
* for citizens of countries where the local currency can't be trusted. Venezuela, Zimbabwe, India...
* for people who want privacy and financial freedom. No gatekeepers.
* for merchants who simply just want to save Visa and Mastercard's transaction fees
* as a store of value, like gold
Currently Bitcoin does a relatively poor job at all those tasks, except for possibly being a store of value, because of the congestion on the network.  **However**, the Lightning Network is soon ready, likely sometime in 2018. The development seems to be going very well. If LN gets successfully implemented and widely adopted, Bitcoin will be able to support millions of instant transactions per second, at very low fees. When that happens we will finally get to see if Bitcoin will serve a real purpose in the world. 
The Lightning Network is undercommunicated, so I suspect that even at $10,000 Bitcoin could be massively undervalued. I don't think most people in Bitcoin realize how close we are to a true scaling solution and what that means for Bitcoin's utility.  The market cap of Bitcoin is still only about 1/6 of Apple's or 2.1% of the world's gold supply. So I don't think the price truly reflects Bitcoin's potential.

I don't know Core's reasons for not supporting modestly larger blocks, but as long as that's the project where all the best developers work, and everything is transparent, I'll probably place my bets with them. Meanwhile, all the crooks and hucksters (Roger Ver, Craig Wright, Kim Dotcom, Jihan Wu, John McAfee...) seem to be lining up behind BCH. Doesn't inspire much confidence in the project IMO.
I placed my bets by selling all my BCH for BTC last month. I think BCH is simply just redundant in today's crypto market. For people who need a better user experience than you get with BTC today, we already have Ethereum, Litecoin and hundreds of other altcoins that are more established. Some of them even bring genuine inventions to the table. BCH doesn't. Similar to Litecoin, it's just another copy of BTC with some tweaked parameters.

You share some interesting considerations on the difference between investing in stocks and in bitcoin. Thanks.
"63% of Americans can't come up with $500 for an emergency. 69% have less than $1000 in savings. Only 55% of Americans invest in the stock market."
That means that at least 18% of Americans invest in the stock market, while at the same time can't find $500 for an emergency. Why don't they just sell of some of their stocks? That way they will surely have $500 for the emergency, unless their stock holdings are miniscule. If only what you have cash is considered to be your savings or considered to be what you can "come up with for an emergency", then I think that investing in stocks when you have less than $500 in your bank account to be a strange priority.

Bitcoin is more limited in supply, more fungible, more divisible and easier to transport and secure than gold. It is therefore, in many aspects, superior to gold as a convenient store of value.
However, it doesn't have the long tradition nor the intrinsic value that gold has. Even if gold becomes worthless you can still make pretty, shiny things with it. The same can't be said about intangible bitcoins, which would no longer serve any purpose. Bitcoin isn't really backed by anything either, only naked trust. Fiat money has no intrinsic value either, but it is at least backed by something that is inescapable: debt.

You conveniently linked to the the article from 2009, which doesn't show hard drive drives prices from 2010 and onwards. Here's the update from 2014:  
It shows the GB price flattening since 2010, which is very much in line with my own experience as an enthusiast and builder of computers since 2004.
If Bitcoin was to have the same transaction capacity as Visa has today, with its 56,000 transactions per second, Bitcoin would need 14 GB blocks (assuming 4 transactions per second per MB). That's 2 TB of added blocks to the chain every single day. Scaling on chain is simply not feasible in the foreseeable future if we want Bitcoin to stay decentralized. If we don't want a decentralized Bitcoin, we could just use any shitcoin, fiat currency or PayPal. I would argue for a modest increase in block size, but only as a temporary measure until the Lightning Network is successfully implemented.

The traffic analogy might be a very fitting one. It's been proven time and time again that just adding more lanes doesn't reduce congestion, as people adapt by driving more and using alternatives like public transport less. By simply widening a road, congestion is at best temporarily reduced.
 
Last year a major road was temporarily closed for upgrades in Oslo, Norway. Everyone expected chaos, but pretty much nothing actually happened. The city dwellers, intelligent as they are, just quickly adapted to this new situation, which was announced and widely known in advance.
Bitcoin is another type of infrastructure where I can easily see similar collective behaviour could apply.
