Yes, but that's what insurance would be willing to provide for cheap.


They do offer proper insurance, for a price...
Under insurance is super common. For example it's an open secret that the Swiss FDIC would woefully fail if any of the major banks failed. Their whole banking system is insured up to 6 billion.
Car insurance in the US may only cover a few tens of thousands, which can be insufficient to cover even just medical cost for one person.
Nuclear power plants in Germany are insured up to 250 million of actual insurance (2.5 billion through mutual liability). Considering the millions that would be displaced and all the homes, cars, offices, factories that would likely have to be abandoned, either number could as well be 0 in a major accident.

I understand why it exists and why it makes sense, but if I'm just *barely* decided that I want to buy something, that additional hurdle can make me go "meh, fuck it, not dealing with my bank tonight, I didn't want it that much" or simply prevent me from buying because I simply *can't* authenticate.

Only BTC was stolen. The value of the stolen BTC was 36% of all assets. This is from the official announcements. Bitfinex had assets that were not BTC, that were not stolen. Ergo, more than 36% of BTC was stolen. 49% is a very plausible number. May also be official, idk. People also tracked Bitfinex' cleanup and the number of BTC lost and kept quite closely on the block chain.

It is not going to happen - for it to happen, it would have to be better in convenience and/or price, which it won't be in the long term.
**Bitcoin won't be mainstream, but it can do two things as a payment system**:
* **Cover markets that regular processors don't cover well**: from "slightly icky" like porn over "technically legal but everyone knows what it's for" like VPN services to plain illegal like recreational drugs or imports of otherwise unaffordable medication from other countries, to cybercrime/extortion (ransomware, kidnappings).
* **Provide a lower bound.** It will not be the cheapest and/or convenient, but it will force regular payment providers to be less shitty. (They can't raise prices too far or people might switch to Bitcoin).
Additionally, it can provide a **store of value/speculation opportunity**, of course, but that's a different topic.
In order to be better in convenience, first Bitcoin would have to overcome the network effect. If I have PayPal but don't have Bitcoin, Bitcoin will not be more convenient. This is bigger than just "be accepted everywhere": If people's income is in fiat and merchants want fiat, the fiat-Bitcoin-fiat conversion will make it very hard to make it more convenient and cheaper.
Holding Bitcoin "yourself" will remain very hard for people, since you suddenly need to run almost bank-grade security yourself (or buy expensive, specialized hardware for it - merchants may have paid less to PayPal for all my transactions so far than I'd have to pay for a Trezor). Especially in case of merchants, it's likely they'd need a payment provider to handle everything for them. At that point, the financial benefit vs. existing solutions shrinks further.
The crypto/decentralization properties don't matter, what matters for people is what the system does and how well. A centralized system is perfectly suitable to take fiat from one place, optionally convert it to another currency, and deposit in another place. If large enough, it can also do so cheaply. Using Bitcoin only makes sense if you need a "common language" that mutually distrusting providers can speak. This way, you can have a remittance/exchange provider that is great at serving Fiat &lt;--&gt; Bitcoin in country 1, and a different one for that in Country 2, and the additional competition may make that cheaper than having to rely on oligopolists that managed to build a centralized system spanning the world. But then again, the existing oligopolists can just lower prices because they already have the infrastructure, and continue being cheaper *and* more convenient.

I think this won't be practically applicable.
Much easier to get two independent battery-powered airgapped computers (e.g. smartphones, possibly with Trezor), a pen, a bunch of dice or other randomness devices, and a sledgehammer, into a shielded room/tent.
Generate key. Enter key. Perform private key operation. Write down result. Verify using other device. Possibly remove result from room (while maintaining shielding) to do some additional things (like sending Bitcoins for additional verification). Wipe devices and apply sledgehammer. Leave room, incinerate smashed devices.
Even if the devices had been backdoored, they couldn't weaken the randomness of the private key (because it was generated externally), and they couldn't leak the key, because they were smashed beyond any ability to transmit before being removed from the secure environment.
What is much more likely to happen in practice, though, is buying some sort of certified HSM, because what matters almost more than the actual security is the ability to prove the security to others.

One thing to keep in mind is that the more complex and non-standard stuff you use, the higher the risk of a mistake that makes you lose bitcoin to corrupted keys etc.
I'm not telling you not to do this, but like with backups, *verify* before you assume it's OK. Send a minimal amount, make a TX withdrawing it, sign it (the private key operation can probably also be done with calculator and paper) and verify the tx with a standard client (without broadcasting it, so you don't reveal the unhashed pubkey). Repeat a few days later.
@_date: 2016-04-17 22:47:22
Yes and no. 
First of all, of course there could be a browser extension. Network traffic might need to be proxied but this could likely be done without requiring trustworthy proxies. Except for that, everything could be done via the extension.
For pure "just visit a web site": It would be doable but not trustless depending on your definition. There is currently no way to securely store general-purpose crypto keys in a browser in a way that the website that made you generate them can't steal them.
If you philosophically accept the site as the software distribution point (i.e. you trust them just like you trust whatever site you download your Bitcoin client from) and don't mind that you're downloading a fresh copy every time you open it (i.e. it could be replaced by a malicious one at any time), then yes, you could run it in a browser. People often consider this insecure or iffy, but it's not really different from any software with automatic updates. The crypto keys would never have to leave your machine, you would just need a proxy as described above.
Of course, there could also be various setups that involve more trust in third parties (basically like trusting an exchange).
This is true for almost *any* system or protocol - I can confidently make these statements without knowing in detail how OpenBazaar works internally. This can be (and has been) done e.g. with BitTorrent clients or Bitcoin wallets.
All of these would require significant software development effort which would be hard to monetize.

Because tens or hundreds of thousands of man-hours of both paid and volunteer time were invested into making Bitcoin work, and insane amounts of well-paid man-hours were invested to make banking work.
Voting, on the other hand, gets contracted out to the lowest bidder who needs to have more bureaucrats than coders because otherwise they couldn't get the bid in. The coders are also not necessarily good, because the good ones avoid places with lots of bureaucracy. Then they hack some one-off solution that just barely fulfils the requirement because there is no incentive to do anything more. Then that system is only "tested" under realistic conditions maybe twice a year when it is actually used somewhere, and since each location has countless customizations and those change from election to election, it's closer to being "tested" *once* in total (during the actual election).

No. The only way to identify and authenticate the owner is the keypair that *will* be broken. The owner could move the coins to a new address before QC becomes a thing, but they'd have to do it themselves, and we don't know if the owner is still alive/if the keys still exist. The assumption is that these coins are effectively dead, and if the owner were to move them (proving that they're still in the game) this alone could significantly affect the price of Bitcoin (and start another witch hunt trying to find the real Satoshi).
The alternatives are either letting ~5% of all Bitcoin that will ever exist get stolen (no action), or setting a deadline for moving coins to quantum-safe outputs and declaring any outputs not moved in 5 years to be invalid (soft fork). This will be extremely controversial.

If the fork happens by consensus of an overwhelming majority of miners and exchanges, yes. Especially if it happens right after a difficulty adjustment - the other chain will be dead. See also the comment below on Ethereum.
SPV wallets won't even need to upgrade.


Because it was a contentious fork, and meant to be one, not a clean, ethereum-style upgrade. There have been many non-contentious Ethereum hard fork upgrades that went mostly unnoticed by most.

Currently, if you were to run a node and pay for it in Bitcoin monthly, the main cost wouldn't be the server rental, it would be the transaction costs.
If you assume that someone who is running a fully validating node is actually transacting with Bitcoin more than just once a month, it becomes clear that the current trade-off between cost to run a node and cost to make a transaction is insane.
I highly doubt the wheel can be turned around. People were screaming about this rather obvious issue for years, and they were ostracized, ridiculed, banned, removed (avoiding the c word here...), cheated with an agreement that one side walked away from after getting their half of a compromise, and driven to create alts.
Given this history, I don't see how consensus for fixing this issue within Bitcoin can be found, implemented and deployed before every payment provider has either switched to an alt or gone bankrupt, and every vendor has either switched or given up on crypto altogether forever. I'd love to be proven wrong of course.
Edit to add: Given the current fee level, it seems very likely that few people are using Bitcoin for payments now, and the speculation traffic alone is enough to keep fees high. Lightning isn't going to help with that: the speculation traffic likely won't significantly benefit from channels, and adding channel open/close traffic for payment isn't going to reduce fees. At $20/channel (a low assumption for open+settle), users would have to lock $400 in a channel to be able to transact for less than 5% fees.

Segwit's main benefit in terms of fees is the one-time blocksize increase. And aside from enabling a different kind of pruning, those transactions aren't really cheaper for the network to process. If you assume rising TX volume, the relief would indeed only be temporary, and non-repeatable.

To tank the price, they'd have to have coins. To have coins, they would have to either already have bought them, or buy them now.
This could be the reason why the price is going up.
If that's the case, and they dump all their coins to tank the price, two extremes could happen: 1. People panic-sell, driving the price lower than what it would have been without this manipulation. 2. The market gobbles up the cheap coins because it was established that a coin can be worth 19k, the price drops a bit, but is still higher than a week ago.
Note that in either case, they can make a lot of money because of the futures.
Once they've dumped all their coins, they can't do it again, unless they buy in again, driving the price up. Which they might, again making money with the futures (at the expense of other futures traders).
However, if they try to tank the price, there will be one group motivated to keep the price up: The people who sold them the futures contracts. So *they* may gobble up the cheap coins, *buy some more*, drive the price up a bit further, and make a killing on the futures.
What I think is likely (but keep in mind that I'm no expert) is that a lot of money enters the market and tries to mess with the price. This will increase volatility, but at the same time drive the price up, up, up.

@_date: 2018-09-05 03:08:20
If I understand correctly, that can only work if
* the real value of the currency is actually near the pegged value, or
* the currency cannot actually be exchanged back and forth anywhere near the official value (in which case there is a black market showing the real value, as in Venezuela), or
* the state has a shitton of resources to uphold the peg against market pressure (e.g. the CHF/EUR one-way peg that got scrapped a couple years ago).
Vietnam seems to adjust the peg every couple years, but not by much, leading me to believe that the first point may be the deciding factor here (with forex and capital controls playing a secondary role). Wikipedia lists inflation at 4.4%, which is obviously more than USD but still pretty reasonable given the circumstances.

ASICs weren't that much of an improvement though, AFAIK.
You are assuming quantum computers  to be somewhat generally available/affordable. If you look at the current d-wave quantum annealer, that is not likely.
Also, we got lucky that ASIC makers sold the chips instead of using them themselves, and that ASICs are cheap enough to develop that multiple companies did it in parallel. We may not get that lucky with quantum computers - since they're also useful for other stuff, a quantum computer owner also does not have to worry about the long-term effects as much as ASIC owners (because their ASICs would be useless if Bitcoin failed).

Disagree. It doesn't provide strong cryptographic guarantees on zeroconf. It does provide good *practical* performance for it.
Credit cards are attractive even though there is a lot of fraud. For zeroconf Bitcoin, the practical fraud risk so far was low enough to make it a non-issue. That might change with such a change.
So far, the low fraud risk was achieved by a) miners having a financial interest in not fucking bitcoin up, and b) it being really hard for miners to do the wrong thing (they'd have to build their own client), which kept them from doing it. As long as the overwhelming majority of miners are non-RBF, zeroconf still works, because it reduces the risk that fraud attempts will succeed, at least as long as blocks are not ridiculously full.
I think this is an attempt to force people from the public Bitcoin blockchain into walled gardens. To be more clear, this is an attempt by Blockstream et al to destroy the usefulnes of Bitcoin in the hopes of profiting off their walled garden offering. The more likely result is that their walled garden will fail because even Bitcoin isn't that attractive, so one of many walled gardens based on it will be even less interesting, but they will still fuck up Bitcoin for everyone.

The impressive part about Bitcoin is not the individual technical pieces. There is almost nothing really new if you look at the pieces individually. Proof of work is old. Digital signatures are old. Hash chains are old. What makes it great is how those pieces come together to form a true masterpiece with every detail thought through. This is, in my opinion, clearly worthy of the highest awards there are. Economics is a huge part of it - and by that I don't just mean the system he created, I mean how economics are used to make said system feasible (mining, deflation, fees, block reward adjustments ...). At the same time, of course, what the Bitcoin system provides must also not be forgotten.
All in all, yes, in my opinion, Satoshi Nakamoto deserves the Nobel prize for Economics, *and* a Turing Award.

Is it? I thought you send your TX to one miner, and that miner immediately sends it to all others. For a successful doublespend, you'd need to send one TX to all big miners and at the same time another one to the payment provider. If the payment provider had nodes communicating directly with the miners, he could verify which TX the miners know within seconds (or relay the "good" one).

We don't really need that many nodes for the network to be sufficiently decentralized.

Sounds like you want to convert CAD to EUR. If you don't need to involve BTC, use a service like Transferwise. It's probably going to be cheaper than sending money through the traditional banking system to an exchange, buying BTC, withdrawing them to another exchange, selling the BTC there, and sending the money through the traditional banking system to its destination.
Going through BTC lets you avoid the conversion/transfer fees of a money transmitter by letting the market of BTC exchanges and traders take that role, but the money transmitters can have very competitive rates that you are unlikely to beat by much. Also, going through BTC exposes you to quite a few risks (volatility, two counterparties instead of one, user error/hacking, ...).

There are two reasons why Greece would want to weaken their currency:

Getting scammed out of $640 seems a lot better than getting scammed out of $16k. 
4% seems like a cheap lession learned to get out from an exchange that seems to have quite a questionable reputation.
I guess your options are getting the money out right fucking now (with or without the fee) and possibly trying to get the fees back later (or not if your time isn't worth $640), or waiting to see if they fix it, and risking to lose all of it if they fail completely. Sucks, but that's life.
If they say they'll charge the fee later, you could try to withdraw everything and hope the fee will put you $640 into the red, then let them chase you for the fee they think are entitled to, instead of you having to chase them to return the $640 you think they are not entitled to.
Also note that if they pay $x in fees to a third party to process withdrawals, and are then forced to eat that cost, they're now $x short, and unless they have enough profit or capital to cover it, they'll go bankrupt. Thus, I'd probably go with the "get as much money as you can out now, even at a loss, because 96% of the money is better than 0%".

I'd like to point out that while it might sounds scary, the bandwidth is totally feasible today with a home Internet connection if you have Google Fiber or another Gbit link.
Needless to say that we can expect that kind of bandwidth, storage and computing power to be in everyone's pocket by 2036.
To go further, let's assume we decide that we want to run a node in a theroetical bitcoin network that is constantly maxing out 8 GB blocks, which is a ridiculous assumption even with an 8 GB limit (Edit: some of the numbers are wrong, but since they are too high, that's OK to demonstrate the feasibility):  
8 GB/block  * 10 blocks/hour * 24 hours/day = **2 TB of storage per day, 730 TB of storage per year.**
Expensive as hell today, but storage is one of the areas where there are no signs that improvements will stop.
Assuming the number of 250 Byte per tx that I found somewhere online, this also means 32M transactions per block. Assuming each tx pays $0.001 in fees, that's $32k per block just from tx fees. Assuming ECDSA is the biggest cost here. My 5 year old CPU can verify 200 tx per second per core. Assuming modern CPUs are five times as fast per core (too lazy to test but [should be realistic]( that's ~55 CPU cores needed to run a node.
So how much does this cost us? Since we're just a poor lazy person, we'll put it in the cloud. I don't know how the various "cloud compute units" translate to CPUs, so let's assume they're slightly less shitty than my CPU and we need ~256 of them to fulfill our compute needs. That's 8 32-core machines we need to get on Google Cloud. Conveniently, this also gives us a TB of RAM for caching unspent outputs, database indices etc.
Let's keep one year of blockchain on standard high-availability cloud storage, and another 3 years on nearline storage.
Our node also has a generous 3x the blockchain size in egress traffic (which sucks since traffic is expensive as hell on Cloud). 8 GB * 10 * 6 * 24 * 30 = 345600 GB/month. I'm putting it as EMEA traffic which is cheaper than APAC.
We now have network, compute, and storage covered. I don't think I forgot anything (aside from the need to adapt the software to run on a set of machines, which I suspect would be surprisingly doable). The monthly total is about $75k with todays Cloud prices, but if you have the money, *you* could have these resources available to you at the click of a mouse. It might sound expensive, but remember, we're talking about:
* running blocks that are always fully maxed, which requires 32 million transactions per block and assumes that no soft-limits are put in place
* running that unrealistic scenario with limits that will apply in 20 years, on platforms and for prices that are available today
* running it on a cloud provider, which is notoriously expensive but makes sure you don't need to pay a server guy to swap dead drives
* the price of running the infrastructure is less than the fees generated from three blocks, assuming a minimum tx fee of 1/10th of a cent.
Now, we don't have that kind of money, so let's do it on the cheap. We're getting 40 of [these]( for $100k per *year*. That gives us: 
* Storage for 2.5 years worth of blockchain if we don't want much redundancy
* More bandwidth than we can use
* 320 shitty CPU cores
All this can be paid for with the fees from less than 4 blocks. Per year.
Now, let's go further. Let's simply assume that in 20 years, everyone has a symmetric gigabit link at home. I think that's a pretty reasonable assumption. Bandwidth is a total non-issue. Let's assume CPUs don't manage to speed up much, only 10x vs. todays fast CPUs. That means a 6 core gamer CPU will be enough. Remains the question of disk. Assuming disks double every 3 years, that's 6+ doublings. That means that a $100 hard disk will be 256 TB. Thus, you'll be able to build a full node PC for &lt;$1000.
If you're worried about that, spend $25 and buy 1/10th of a Bitcoin. If Bitcoin grows to 4.6 billion transactions per day, which would be necessary to fill these blocks, I'm sure that'll pay for a full node.
Edit: I think I miscalculated the traffic, it is too high in the cloud example. Guess that'll pay for IOPS which don't seem to be free. Edit: Also, 6 blocks per hour, not 10. Reduces the disk requirement. Too lazy to fix.

That's not what "security by obscurity" means. Security by obscurity is a well-established term that means "it's *only* secure because it's built in a hard-to-understand way, if someone understood it, it would be completely broken". For DRM, that's the case, since whatever is displaying the content has to have the decryption key *somewhere*, the DRM just makes it hard to get at it.
Bitcoin (and other good cryptographic software) follows [Kerckhoffs's principle]( The workings of the entire system are public and well-understood, but as long as the private key is kept private, it is hard (in the sense of "the heat death of the universe happens before you succeed") to break it. Unlike with DRM, the private key can be kept private in Bitcoin.

If you told someone in 1986 that we'll routinely carry around 32 GB of memory in our pockets by 2015, and sending data wirelessly at dozens of megabits per second, you'd probably be considered crazy by most people too. That was the time where 1.44 MB floppy disks were bleeding edge technology and you needed proprietary technology to get 9.6 kbit/s through a *wired* long-distance connection.
Over a Gbit connection, you can pull 60 GB in 10 minutes *today*. You really think that in *29 years*, a 130 GB block cap will be a problem? Especially since noone forces miners to mine blocks over a certain size. 51% of the mining power can decide that the max block size is 500 KB, and as long as 51% of the mining power agrees, that's the max block size. They just can't *raise* it above the hard limit, but they can lower it.

PGP/GPG is shit.
No major client supports it natively.
The library support is shitty to nonexistant. Enigmail seems to parse the output of the interactive executable, and that seems to be the default way of interacting with it. Which is a hack that shouldn't exist in any software, let alone critical crypto code.
The web of trust is too complex even for advanced users. Manual 1:1 key verification, or simply fetching the key and trusting it blindly, are the usual ways people exchange keys. If people try to use the web of trust, they end up effectively turning other people's keys into fully "CAs".
As a result, usability is crap. As a result, no one uses it. And that's good. It's insecure, despite being cryptographically sound, because it's too hard to use correctly. Kerckhoffs principle doesn't just say that a system has to be secure despite being public - it also states that it has to be easy to use. This fact, known since the 19th fucking century, is totally ignored by PGP/GPG.
Yes, the CA model has had failures, but overall, it works. You could still add manual key verification as a layer on top of it. S/MIME is supported natively in many clients. This makes it very, very easy to use.
I really don't think we should try to push PGP.

I've intentionally bloated the tx to prevent you from doing this.
Also, assuming that is not possible due to a tx size limit: I can just try 100 times to be faster than you. You have to relay it faster than I can send it out *every* time, I only have to succeed *once* and can try as often as I want.

20 MB blocks mean that a non-mining full node needs [~270 kbit/s downstream]( Since you also want control traffic, tx's that get sent to you outside of blocks, ... make that 1 Mbit/s. If you can watch Netflix on your device without puking pixels, you can run a full node.
Now, upstream for miners is a bit more difficult. If you want to reduce the risk of your block being orphaned, you want to push it out fast. If you want less than a 1% chance of someone else mining a block while you upload yours, that would be 100 times as much, so ~ 30 Mbit. Let's make that 150 so you can upload your block to five people at the same time. That costs you around [seven bucks a month]( This is, of course, assuming you don't use a mining pool anyways, which you likely will if you're small enough to worry about things like that. Or you can simply mine empty blocks, if that's what you choose to do. Then your additional outbound bandwidth requirements are 0.
Coincidentally, one such box will also supply the required bandwidth to feed 200+ full nodes during the 99.99+% of the time where you aren't uploading your block.

You are claiming a "strong" centralizing effect due to full nodes being more expensive.
I'm claiming the effect isn't strong, because even with 20 MB blocks, the resource usage doesn't matter that much for people who are running a server. That may not be everyone, but you certainly don't have to be a giant mining pool to do so. You just have to have ~10 bucks a month. There are plenty of people willing to spend this kind of money to just run a full node.
If you are already running a full node on a dedicated server that does nothing else, as many people are, even if you have a rather cheap server, it would likely be able to handle 20 MB blocks with the ressources that currently sit idle.
There is no risk that due to 20 MB blocks, only "big players" could run full nodes.
The cost of running a full node is split into two parts: The cost of the resources, and the effort required to set it up. The latter is independent from the block size, and my claim is that the latter is a much bigger hurdle than the former when it comes to deploying full nodes. If you increase block size twentyfold, and at the same time make it easier to install full nodes, I think there will be *more* decentralization, not less.
Source: I've set up a full node on a box that had spare resources, still has spare resources, and would still have spare resources if Bitcoin grew 20-fold. And I could get a cheaper, faster server if I bothered enough to do so and didn't care about redundant drives (which I don't really need for my use case).

If most exchanges don't support it, and most merchants don't accept it, then the value of coins on the old chain will quickly diminish. This, in turn, will make mining less profitable, hastening the decline.

Thanks for the link to the French passport doc... I really didn't expect that.


That was part of the problem, but another part is that this is not considered to be too critical since the sandbox should prevent anything bad from happening. If the Bitcoin JavaCard code was deployed on dedicated cards with no other applets on them, I agree that this would have a decent chance of resulting in a secure solution. However, it seems that one suggested usecase is deploying them on hardware that already serves other purposes, including SIM cards. That also implies that the keys necessary to deploy the applet are not thrown away nor safely locked away, never to be used.

OTOH, if they provide guarantees, they may be one of the few entities big enough to actually pay out when they get owned and the coins get stolen.
So assuming appropriate guarantees are in place, using them makes sense if you expect the legal system to be better at not losing your property than you will be at safely storing and using crypto keys (and not getting them hacked).
If I were a hedge fund or similar entity (which is what this product is designed for), I'd have two options: hiring experts to build me a super-secure cold storage system and hope that they don't fuck up and don't get tempted to simply steal an amount much higher than they'll ever earn in their lives, or pay Goldman Sachs to take care of it. For most entities, this will be an easy choice.

That's not what "security by obscurity" means. Security by obscurity is a well-established term that means "it's *only* secure because it's built in a hard-to-understand way, if someone understood it, it would be completely broken". For DRM, that's the case, since whatever is displaying the content has to have the decryption key *somewhere*, the DRM just makes it hard to get at it.
Bitcoin (and other good cryptographic software) follows [Kerckhoffs's principle]( The workings of the entire system are public and well-understood, but as long as the private key is kept private, it is hard (in the sense of "the heat death of the universe happens before you succeed") to break it. Unlike with DRM, the private key can be kept private in Bitcoin.

You need a computer with a good Internet connection. If you have an unmetered connection with at least 10 Mbit/s upstream at home, you can easily run it at home. Just take any computer with enough disk space to hold the blockchain, e.g. a raspberry pi with a USB drive plugged into it, and install Bitcoin-core or bitcoin-xt. You can also of course install it on your regular computer.
If not, you'll want to rent a server - virtual or physical - in some datacenter. Something like [this]( or really almost any VPS you can find. Just make sure the disk is big enough to hold the blockchain and you have enough traffic (I guess consumption will be below 2 TB, but I'd go with a provider that offers unlimited or 5+ TB just to not have to worry about it. Then install bitcoin-core or bitcoin-xt there.
You probably do NOT want to go with Amazon EC2 or Google Cloud, they're expensive if you don't need their advanced features and reliability.
Note that I wouldn't worry about it at this point. There's enough people running nodes. If it becomes a problem, start worrying about it. I'm running it because the machine is there and has spare resources in all dimensions (bandwidth, CPU, memory, disk, IOPS, ...), so hell, why not. I wouldn't rent a box just for a full node.
@_date: 2015-06-19 17:50:07
OK, against individual Bitcoin nodes, of course. I'm more talking about payment providers. I still don't think you'd need to be connected to a significant fraction, just the miners (assuming they are known you you can get some arrangement with them if you're a big provider). Have one "writing" and one 'reading" node per miner (assumes you don't want to customize your node code). Once you know of a good tx, push it to all miners through the writing nodes. The reading notes get their tx's from the miner nodes, thus if your tx is on all readers and there are no conflicts, you can assume a few seconds after pushing the good tx that that's the one which will be mined.
@_date: 2015-06-28 00:32:49
Edit: OP (or the mods) deleted the OP as I was writing this, so I'm putting it here.
Bitcoin is definitely better than money is a Greek bank account. EUR in some form that the Greek government can't easilfy force-convert into Drachma is also good (cash, EUR-denominated stock/fonds/..., EUR in a bank account in Germany under your name, or EUR in a Coinbase/Kraken/other exchange account).
However, be wary of slow sign-up processes at exchanges and banks and transfer delays, as well as limits. The right time to do this would have been weeks ago...
At this point, it may be too late unless Greek banks do bank transfers on Sunday, but *if* the banks reopen on Monday without having converted everything to Drachma, and that's a increasingly big *if*, get the money out of the bank account right fucking now.
Note that this is advice of an amateur when it comes to banking, but I think it's solid enough. Keep some in the account for day to day business. **Keep EUR cash around** for when banks shut down and you need to buy something on the grey market.
All in all, it boils down to two things:
 1. Have your assets in "not Euro in Greek bank accounts". Can be anything, including Bitcoin. Or gold. Or cigarettes or coffee.
 2. Have something you can use to pay after the big bang. Gold is not well suited for that, since it's hard to authenticate, measure and divide. EUR cash will probably be the primary "unofficial" currency due to it's abundance. Bitcoin might rise. Coffee and cigarettes were popular currencies for black/grey markets in other countries decades ago, but you can't be sure they will be again.
It's a good opportunity to buy Bitcoin, but unless you have no other ways of getting the money out quickly, you don't *need* to use Bitcoin to get your money out. But you can. You probably shouldn't put *all* your money into a volatile cryptocurency that may change value quickly and where a small mistake can make you lose everything, though.

The backup is unprotected by the PIN (its a piece of paper, it can't do exponential backoff), and the trezor holds the key in the internal memory which may be recoverable to someone performing invasive attacks (not sure if the trezor chip is hardened against those).

The reason for the state to drop out would be to be able to devalue the currency. If this goes to the extreme, a shadow economy develops, as has happened in most other countries with massive inflation. The shadow economy will use one or multiple external currencies.
If Greece decides to crack down on it, no bank will allow you to have a bank account in EUR or USD or transact in those currencies electronically. Thus, Bitcoin would be the most convenient way to send money to other people if you can't meet in person.
If you were in Greece and had EUR in your bank account, there's a good chance you'd wake up and find out that you now have Drachma in your bank account, and in the next morning wake up and find out that the Drachma now buy half as much bread as the EUR you had did before they got exchanged.
If you want to save your money from that but still need to be able to use it for remote transactions, bitcoin is indeed the way to go.
The local shadow economy will likely rely on Euro cash, but bitcoin might also start playing a role.

This shows that the some time in January, tx demand fell below capacity, and stayed below it.
According to  segwit adoption increased from 10% to 15% in January, while tx demand fell by over 30% even if you measure from the through around Christmas instead of the surrounding peaks.
Tx demand after that has remained around the level of 2016.
Meanwhile, if we assume 100% adoption, the scaling provided by SegWit is around 2x for standard transaction patterns if I remember correctly (and not more than 4x in the theoretical best case). From this follows that even with 100% adoption, contention could be expected again if Bitcoin reached the same throughput as it had during the peak.
Had Bitcoin continued to grow, it is likely that Segwit would not have been enough to bridge the time until Lightning is ready for mainstream adoption.

This is exactly what you don't want to hear from someone developing Bitcoin-related software. That's like hearing from the "doctor" going to do open-heart surgery on you that his experience consists of "I dissected a frog once".
Listen, Bitcoin does not forgive mistakes. It can be very secure if handled correctly, but the slightest mistake will allow someone to steal all money you and others have in accounts controlled by your application. Unless you have a shitton of IT security AND programming experience, do not attempt to write anything that in any way handles private keys. You owe your users that. Building such software would be like being that doctor. Insecure software can get very big and successful before it comes crashing down - see how often e.g. whatsapp got pwned, and now imagine each time would mean customers losing all their coins.
Also keep in mind that businesses that succeed are highly visible, and they look awesome - people get rich! What you don't see is the large numbers of people who tried and failed. To be successful, you need an extraordinarily good idea, AND extraordinarily good implementation AND extraordinarily good business management (this is where many IT people fail), AND a shitton of luck on top of that.

Pirate Party Germany. It's not a government, but it used Liquid Democracy, implemented in the Liquid Feedback software, as a non-binding tool for internal decision-making. I strongly supported it, but reality proved me wrong.


I know that this is the theory behind Liquid. I attended talks about it by its inventors, I used it, I know why it's supposed to be better and how it works.
The theory would be true if all voters cared. Unfortunately, they don't. The system strongly favors delegated over direct votes. Direct votes require a lot of effort and time, while delegation is a one-off, fire-and-forget thing. Delegates cast hundreds (on in a parliament-replacement scenario, hundreds of thousands) votes at once, and they tend to always participate (because a. their vote actually matters, b. they know how to use the system, so they set up ring delegations among friends). The individual voters correcting them are impacted by participation ("turnout"), which is very hard to get high enough even in one-man-one-vote systems. Because Liquid gives participants the (not too inaccurate) impression that their individual vote does not have much say, participation drops further. Sure a small part of the voters who disagree with their delegate's vote will correct it (directly or by changing their delegate), but not enough of them.
Even if the turnout is high, unless it is as high as delegated voting turnout, it effectively places direct votes at a strong disadvantage.
As I said - I saw the effects in practice, and I would oppose any attempt to introduce this anywhere as vigorously as I initially supported this.
The current state of the German Pirate Party (best explained with [this symbolic picture]( can, IMHO, be attributed to a great part to not having a usable direct-democratic tool due to the failed LQFB experiment.

The signs at the airport were designed to be rude, the staff was OK, but the website is what made my decision to avoid them.
It's as if they told an intern to get drunk before he starts coding, then asked him if it works, and after he said "well, one of the three booking paths works if you manually assemble your data into a pipe-separated string" they said "awesome, you're done, here's some $2-per-gallon box of wine, drink that and then go make it a bit more aweful".

I understand Bitcoin in detail. While it does have advantages (I don't think I have to name them here), it does also have problems. It requires users to handle security, which is too complicated for most regular users. There are serious privacy problems due to the public blockchain, even though the "accounts" (addresses) are anonymous.
There is serious volatility. It wastes incredible amounts of energy. It does not scale well. A security issue in the client could allow a worm to spread extremely quickly to all online machines that have that Bitcoin client (following the already-existing P2P network) and plunder the wallets. Malicious mining pools can become a problem. If the crypto gets broken, a lot of Bitcoins can get stolen instantly. While the network is able to recover from that on a technical level, it may not be able to do so on a social and economic level (large amounts of stolen Bitcoin in circulation + loss of trust).
Then, there is also a social issue with it. Bitcoin is often praised for being "uncontrollable" money. (This is not completely true, as e.g. the Silkroad bust showed, but since it is often used as a pro-BTC argument, I'll mention it here.) The question is: Do we want that? In cases where what the government does goes against your will and the will of most of the people (e.g. prohibition of marijuana), your answer may be yes. However, governments (are supposed to) have the function of creating democratic rule and protect people who can't protect themselves from powerful/rich people who want to do what they want. Now, governments may suck at this, especially in the US, but in general, the system is still reasonably good. Just look south towards the cartel murders and gang violence in Mexico and South America. Taking power from an overly restrictive government that acts unfairly may seem attractive, but the alternative may turn out to be even worse. If you complain about the rich getting preferential treatment now, imagine a situation where they can buy anything with uncontrollable money - not just drugs, but also services ala "I don't like this guy, go break his legs".
Currently, the government has certain powers: Taxes are collected based on income, wealth etc. and go towards infrastructure used by everyone. If someone refuses to pay you, a court can order him to do so and can garnish his wages (or property, in other countries at least - I don't know how it works in the US, but in most other countries, if there is a judgement against someone and he doesn't pay up, some kind of authority is going to take the money from his bank account with a court order, or seize is property). If someone violates the law, they can be issued with a fine, and if they don't pay, see above. You can't effectively do that with Bitcoin. If a wallet is well-encrypted and sufficient backups exist, the government can neither take possession of the coins nor stop the person from using them (short of throwing them in a cell with a total communication blackout).
Thus, all these powers get severely restricted if there is only uncontrollable money. This may be a good thing if the government is really, really bad, but it can also cause much bigger issues than it solves. In most western countries, including the US, this would, in my humble opinion, be the case.
After all, realize that weed is going to be legalized in more and more states, following the democratic process - it may be slow, but it may not be necessary to overthrow the government just because some things suck.

Yeah, about that... it takes about 5 minutes on average until a transaction is confirmed by a single block... and you need to be online for that.
It may not be an "anti-counterfeiting" measure, but you still need to do pretty good checking with bitcoin - which is so inconvenient that it is probably often skipped (noone wants to wait 5+ minutes for their payment to confirm in the blockchain, let alone an hour for it to be confirmed by the recommended 6 blocks).

You're not wrong.
If your goal is to own coins for the coins sake (e.g. for ideological reasons, because you expect fiat to collapse completely and Bitcoin becoming the currency of the wasteland, etc.), this makes sense.
However, if the goal is to make profit from investing/speculating with coins, then the IOU from an entity that you trust to be able to pay up is good enough.

The problem with this is that there is very little incentive for *customers* to use Bitcoin over say credit cards or Paypal.
Using a service you are already signed up with (and more people have Paypal than, say, coinbase) is much, much more convenient than signing up for a new one.
Additionally, using "old" methods provides me with some kind of customer protection. Merchant doesn't send anything? Chargeback (for CC)/dispute (paypal). Merchant sends a broken product? Chargeback/dispute. I'm an asshole and decide I don't like the product for no reason? Chargeback/dispute. I'm an asshole and decide that this merchant is getting scammed today? Chargeback/dispute.
eBay, Paypal, apparently Amazon, and other platform providers don't hesitate to screw the merchant for a number of reasons: 
 - Each product is typically offered by several merchants. Driving away some merchants does not significantly hurt the platform. Avoiding a merchant that doesn't have the payment method the customer wants usually does not significantly hurt the customer.
 - Customers are provided additional protection by such platforms (since scammy merchants don't last long and the platform usually sides with the customer), and platforms are convenient because the customers already have accounts, and they are thus inclined to use them. Adding good customer protection makes this even stronger, making the next point worse:
 - Merchants basically *have to* use a platform if they want to be noticed (for eBay/Amazon) or if they want to find customers who want to deal with them (PayPal), giving them little recourse.
Except for wanting to support Bitcoin, there is really not much of a reason for a customer to choose to use Bitcoin over Paypal or credit cards. 
If merchants started aggressively offering *noticeable* discounts for paying with Bitcoin, this could change. However, any discount below 5% probably won't move a lot of users unless we're talking about expensive products. A discount of 5% or more is more expensive than just paying the damn extortion fee to Paypal or the credit card company. Also, because PayPal and CC companies are not dumb, but very greedy, they have clauses in their contracts that may make this illegal (sometimes depends on jurisdiction, sometimes depends on how it's implemented).
On the other hand, there are one-time costs associated with adding a new payment method - you have to integrate it in your web store etc. The merchants have already paid that cost for Paypal/CC (and new merchants have to, because bitcoin-only will not yield many customers).
This is why getting bitcoin adopted is so hard. Customers have absolutely no incentive to use it (unless discounts are offered). It is advantageous to merchants, but also bears large one-time costs for them (integrating it into web shop software will certainly cost a few man-hours) for limited benefit.
All of you who prefer Bitcoin on priciple, and choose merchants based on this, are the only reason that could motivate a rationally thinking merchant to add Bitcoin as a payment option.

Assuming honest miners: You spend them, and hope your legitimate transaction gets broadcast faster than the attacker can find your public key, break it, and broadcast his transaction. Unless the NSA is trying to steal your coins, this should be pretty painless.
The problem is that miners may not be honest, and then they can break all keys for the TXs in the block and mine a "give all to me" block. This would have to be resolved somehow.
The Bitcoin client could get an update where you broadcast the hash of the transaction, it gets timestamped (via inclusion in a block), and for ECDSA-signed transactions, the tx is only accepted if a hash of the tx was included 100 blocks earlier. You post the TX hash, it gets broadcast, you verify that it has been included, and then you post your TX with the pubkey. Now the attacker can post his TX hash, and you have 100 blocks to get your TX to all nodes. As soon as a node has a valid pair of a properly-aged hash and signature, all newer hashes/transactions are ignored and considered invalid. It would be very messy and possibly require a compatibility-breaking upgrade, but I think it would be possible to design a way to recover.

You basically have a gambling problem. No matter what you do, you need to make - and stand by! - a decision *how much more money you want to put in* when the price goes incredibly low. Given your situation, this amount should be 0, and you need to stand by it. Even if BTC dropped to $1!
No matter whaty you do, only do things to pull you out of it (e.g. selling coins and never, ever, ever buying them back, no matter how deep they fall). **You are no longer trying to make a profit, you are trying to get out with as little losses as possible.** If you try just "one more trade" to make back your losses, you will most likely lose everything.
Whether you hold the coins you already have (remember, you can sell them whenever you want, but you can never, ever buy them back!) or sell them immediately is up to you. If you can't afford further losses, the choice is obvious. If you can, well, hold as long as you want, but do NOT buy coins you sold back and DEFINITELY don't put more money in!


Trying to get it back is a good idea. Trying to get it back by gambling is a horrifyingly bad one. You may think that you know all about trading, but you apparently don't, since you gambled away a lot of money. Sure you might have a lucky streak, but you might as well lose the rest, and the latter is more likely. Just think about how often you were "sure" in the past, and how it turned out.
This applies *especially* if you do make some profit. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, but on average, you lose. Don't let some luck make you think you need to continue gambling. That's why gambling is so addictive.
Stop, and get help if needed.

No, by using and accepting them into the network we're saying that whoever holds the key, holds the coins. The network doesn't make decisions about right or wrong. It doesn't matter whether the keys were stolen, or the coins were payment for something utterly illegal and disgusting.

For Chrome? It collects quite a bit a data - if you chose so. The [privacy whitepaper]( Google has published for it is really impressive. It explains in detail what data is collected, how to turn it off, and why it is collected. It also shows that they do think about privacy at every step, IMHO. (e.g. making certain collection/logging depend on how you chose other privacy settings).
They could simply say "fuck it" since most people don't care about privacy enough to influence their choice of a browser, and nearly noone (including people who really care and are rather knowledgable about computers) actually knows what Chrome really collects. Everyone assumes "it's Google, it collects everything", so if they really did that, not much would change in terms of public perception. But they don't.
Regarding TLS Channel IDs, they are (as is mentioned in the whitepaper) deleted together with cookies.

If the sender has bitcoin and the recipient has a use for bitcoin, there is no better way than sending bitcoin.
If the sender has fiat and the recipient wants/needs fiat (because they don't have a use for bitcoin), then your one fiat transaction (with possibly one currency exchange) suddenly changed into two fiat transactions with two "currency" exchanges (sender needs to buy bitcoin, recipient has to sell bitcoin - both need to transfer the money to/from a "local" exchange, which for non-US countries usually isn't local at all). Due to the delays involved, there is also exchange rate risk, because the value of bitcoin is highly volatile and might change between buying and selling. Also, unless both already have accounts with exchanges, it involves exchange signup, which is a process more annoying and painful than opening a new bank accout due to exchanges being overzealous with KYC crap. Both exchanges will also take quite some fees (a fee for buying/selling BTC and possibly another fee for processing the incoming/outgoing fiat transaction).
For the fiat-to-fiat task, there are (depending on the countries involved) countless providers similar to Western Union but with much, much lower fees that avoid quite a number of the downsides (e.g. no currency risk) and are much more convenient to use. With Transferwise, for example, the total loss for a 1000 EUR Germany/EUR transaction to HKD/Hong Kong, compared to the Google exchange rate, is about 1%. With Bitstamp, for example, I would pay ~4.60 EUR for buying the Bitcoin, ~4.60 EUR for selling them, and then there is a ~1% difference between sell and buy price, and *then* there is a withdrawal fee.
If the recipient has use for Bitcoin, because there is a local Bitcoin economy, and the sender already has an exchange account, it may make sense to use BTC. If the sender has Bitcoin, but the recipient needs cash, it probably makes more sense to keep it for other uses and send fiat instead, unless the cash sending providers are shitty and the local BTC markets are good.
Assuming the recipient does not have a bank account, fees for fiat transfers will probably be higher (this is one of the features of WU) - but so will be the cost of selling the BTC at the destination. Again, you will find combinations where it's easier/cheaper to sell BTC for cash than to receive cash via a fiat transfer provider, but in most cases, it probably won't be.
Also, with Bitcoin, you need to know what you're doing, and it's easy to make a mistake that costs you all the coin.

Debatable. If they said that the price consists of, say, a regular price plus a 8% fee, I'd be OK with it. However, the ATM presents the price as "this is the current Bitcoin price". Also see that they list only one price (the sell price). The buy price was, per OP, $354.27.

Some Bitcoin supporters prosthelytize with the fervor of religious fanatics. Also, many Bitcoin supporters only see the positives, completely ignoring or downplaying the issues, attacking anyone who dares to mention anything negative. This often goes hand-in-hand with bashing the existing financial system with terms usually used by conspiracy nuts.
Let's have an objective look a the current, horrible, evil banking system in Germany. Bank accounts are free (if you are willing to use an online bank or have income), SEPA transactions (i.e. EUR to EUR within some definition of Europe) are free and take one day to complete. Online payments are secure and painless using Lastschrift, which most online stores accept. To pay with Lastschrift, I just have to enter my account number, and I can reverse the payment within 8 weeks. There is Paypal (which is instant, offers some buyer protection, may rip off the merchant, and in turn does Lastschrift to get the money from me) for the rest. If someone hacks my computer, it will be a minor inconvenience to get everything fixed, but I won't lose my money.
Now, Bitcoin. I as a user have to do key management, which is one of the hardest problems in IT security, and keep my client secure. These are annoying tasks if you are an expert in IT security, and absolutely impossible tasks if you are an average user. Any mistake I make means my money is *gone*, with no chance of recovery. (Or I can trust an exchange/webwallet and store my coins there, but then we are back at the banking system, basically. Only unregulated and Goxxy.)
For any purchase I make, I have to deal with two currency exchange transactions (my currency to BTC and BTC to currency of merchant), with BTC being highly volatile. There are significant delays in buying Bitcoin (I basically have to go through the same procedure as when opening a bank account to register with an exchange, then transfer money there, wait for it to arrive, then pay a fee).
As a private individual/buyer, Bitcoin has very, very few benefits. Paypal can't steal my money, because they don't store any money for me. Paying with Lastschrift, PayPal or Credit Card is easy and safe (for me). For the merchants, Bitcoin would have numerous benefits, but if customers don't want it, it's pretty useless for them to invest huge amounts of time into building the interfaces. If they start offering meaningful benefits (e.g. a 3% discount for Bitcoin purchases), customers may be willing to use it, but then the merchant pays as much as if he just takes Painpal or cards.
Due to its volatility, it is not feasible to set prices in BTC (as opposed to setting them in e.g. USD and converting on the fly according to the current BTC price). This makes a BTC economy unlikely, i.e. it is unlikely that a merchant can get BTC from customers and use it to pay for his next order from his supplier and to pay wages. He can pay WITH Bitcoin, but not IN Bitcoin - the payment will be at that day's conversion rate, which may be different than the rate he got the BTC at, which may mean he's bankrupt if the BTC price drops by 20% within a few days as it likes to do. This makes many BTC transactions Fiat -&gt; BTC -&gt; Fiat, which obviously destroys most of Bitcoin's advantages.
Sure, Bitcoin does have a lot of advantages. The banking systems in some countries are horrible or non-existant. It can do international transfers between non-cooperating countries at a similar level of effort and possibly slightly lower cost than other services, and faster than most (though end-to-end, i.e. fiat-to-fiat including exchange at both ends, will be slower). It provides a currency that cannot be artificially inflated. It can support semi-anonymous payment for digital goods. It's very good for sellers, because it's not reversible. I could continue this list, but that is being done enough all over this subreddit.
My point is: Bitcoin has advantages, but it is neither perfect nor so much better than everything else. Being treated like an idiot by Bitcoin supporters for pointing this out makes people angry...
@_date: 2014-11-04 22:08:02
This is one of the reasons I love Bitcoin. The old financial system is not so shitty because it has to be, but because it *can* be. Giving them competition will make it better. It's already pretty OK in the EU (compared to the US), but international transfers are a horrible mess that the banks could easily fix if forced to.

Declined transaction: HOW THE FUCK CAN ANYONE EVEN THINK OF CHARGING FOR THAT?!? Zero. Obviously.

I have no clue what card replacement costs, expedited card replacement is 40 EUR iirc. I don't think changing the PIN is possible, and WTF is "redemption of unused funds".

Depends on how the software is designed. Your browser communicates with servers all the time, yet these sites should not be able to harm you (bugs aside, but a browser is way more complex than bitcoin). Wallet client software usually only trusts servers in a very limited way (e.g. they might be able to fake incoming transactions, but they won't get your key).

I've seen liquid democracy in practice. It does not work and kills direct-democratic participation, because individuals with one vote each now compete with politicians with a mass of delegated votes. "Voter turnout" is what causes the problem - a lot of people delegate and stop caring.
The opinion favored by politicians is only affected by delegation turnout, i.e. the number of people who took the one-time effort of delegating to a person/group they like. The other opinion is affected by turnout for direct votes, which is much lower and puts it at a massive disadvantage.
Let's assume you have a scenario where:
 - 70% of the people want A
 - 90% have made a delegation
 - politicians representing 80% of the delegated votes vote for B
 - the 70% wanting A consist of 9% (of the total) who delegated to A-voting politicians, 54% who delegated to B-voting politicians, and 7% without delegations. Thus, 61% who are unhappy with how their vote gets used.
Now you have 72% of all possible votes voting for B, i. e. 22% of all voters have to change their vote. Thus, more than 1/3rd of the voters who are unhappy need to manually go and vote themselves. That might seem reasonable when compared with regular turnouts, but it isn't. (It also grows if the people who want B but delegated to A-voters go vote).
In less clear cases, individual votes don't matter, and this discourages participation. If you see 100 people voting X, and 1 person with 120 stale delegations voting Y, 50 times in a row, you stop participating. Add to this that there is no single rally point, no "everybody get out to vote today", and a 33% voter turnout is nearly impossible. Even close call votes in Switzerland, which don't suffer of any of these issues, rarely have more than 50% turnout.
Liquid democracy looks nice on paper, but fails horribly in reality.

**THANK YOU** for being completely honest and open about this! The extra verification step with the six-digit code is also great - I assume you have some brute-force prevention in place there.
The risk isn't just telecoms, GSM is broken and anyone within range of the real phone can intercept SMS using $30 hardware (plus sufficiently large hard drives/SSDs). It will *probably* work in practice, just like other such services work, but don't use it for large amounts that would make such attacks worthwile.

I was wondering how one bit of nonce bias can give up so much information. And the answer to it is "lots of signatures", if I understand the beginning of page 4 correctly. Thus, if you happen to make 2^33 signatures with your key, then yes, your key can be cracked in a matter of hours (probably minutes if someone optimizes the attack using GPUs).
For people who don't talk exponential, 2^33 is roughly 8 billion. That's nothing in terms of cryptography or when it comes to automatically running an attack - it's low enough even for attacks that require network interaction to trigger something - but high enough to not be an issue in scenarios where signatures only happen manually.
While this is definitely a very, **very** scary attack in cryptographic terms\*, I don't think this is a very practical attack on personal-use Bitcoin addresses. However, if people are running a service like an exchange by having all their coins in one central address, and then dispensing from it whenever someone wants coins, they could get into dangerous territory if the attack is enhanced a bit. Running an exchange like that would be stupid, but just because it's stupid, doesn't mean noone does it...
Note that I have little understanding of advanced black mathic and didn't even attempt to understand most of the paper.
*) I wonder if/how this affects ECDH and if it allows the NSA to read all our web traffic. It definitely sounds like something that - possibly combined with implementation errors - has a huge potential to leak ECDSA keys if they are used in a context like SSL. Getting 2^33 SSL handshakes from a web server seems feasible, and I think they chose the number so that the attack definitely succeeds, i.e. it would probably work with less. If you do 1000 connections per second for a month, that's about 2^31, so ~four months for 2^33. Now, of course the researchers chose favorable conditions that might not be present in real-world applications, but it is highly, highly disturbing. I feel more and more convinced in my gut feeling that ECC is, at the current moment, a very bad idea.

Yes, they will for the first few rides (not just make almost no money, possibly actually make a loss on it). It's called an investment: after that, they can raise the prices a bit, and after a few more, a bit more.
At this point they would be already earning money, possibly more than with uber since the commissions go away.
When they have lots of great reviews, they can then raise the prices even more until only the people willing to pay a premium for great service are willing to afford them. At that point, they'll make great money.

The m-pesa stuff made me think... it would be possible to implement storing private keys and signing transactions semi-securely using the SIM Application Toolkit. Probably not going to happen though, as the service providers would have to do it, and the security of SIM cards is horrible in practice.
If someone were to build a standalone "wallet device", the most feasible approach would probably be a smartphone with custom software. They are mass produced, meaning cheap. You aren't going to get a portable computer with screen, input device (touchscreen or keyboard), battery, wireless, and possibly camera for QR codes cheaper than that.

For the seller.
For me as a buyer, the fastest, safest and most convenient way is clicking that PayPal button, entering my password, confirming, and being done with it.
I don't have to have a cold wallet, hot wallet, wallet backups, wallet encryption, and all that stuff. If I have a dispute, PayPal buyer protection might work for me. Or not, but the chances it will are higher than with Bitcoin, which has nothing like that.
Nevertheless, I am willing to go to certain lengths to avoid using Paypal, because I know how shitty their practices are. However, I am not the majority of people. Unless you are willing to spend effort and risk because fuck PayPal, Paypal is unfortunately often the better option.
Also, (nearly) everyone has a PayPal account. (Nearly) noone, in the grand scheme of things, has a Bitcoin account. If a seller offers only Bitcoin, this seller goes out of business, fast. This is why nearly every seller has PayPal.
Breaking this circle of everybody-has-it will be really, really hard. Especially if PayPal simply starts to offer a more competitive fee schedule in order to protect their business.

AFAIK, one of the properties of cash is that if you receive genuine cash legally, it doesn't matter whether it's stolen or not. This also makes sense, since anything else would destroy trust in the currency. Why would you be willing to accept a piece of paper with a serial, if at some point in the future you could lose it just because three uses before it was stolen? It wouldn't be a problem today, but I'm pretty sure it would have been back when paper cash was introduced.

If you are comparing to something else, e.g. single-thread encryption, the numbers make sense.

What happens to coins from the old chain? I guess you could recalculate block hashes for the entire old chain, and then everyone would have to agree through out-of-band methods on which old block chain is the real one (remember, just following SHA-256 hashes would be out of the question - maybe we should start including SHA3 hashes in some optional field just as a precaution?).

I'm not sure. Maybe it only affects certain configurations, curves or similar. There were some nasty properties in RSA too that took a while to figure out, caused some implementations to have horrible vulnerabilities, but didn't affect the security of the algorithm. This could be one of these. Or it could be a sign that ECDSA is not sufficiently understood yet, or a sign that ECDSA has a high potential for properties that break it. I have way too little understanding of the math parts of cryptography to judge that, sorry.

Using security for the masses as an argument *for* bitcoin, really?
I'm not sure how stolen CC info affects people in the US, but in Europe, you contest the charges and get a new card and your money back. An inconvenience, but you don't lose money.
With Bitcoin, if you get owned, your money is gone.
For people with a lot of experience in IT, it may be a good deal because you can take security into your own hands, without having to hope that noone else fucks up. For the average person, relying on third parties for security is a way better approach - especially if said third parties eat the cost if something does happen.

Thank you for your answer. No, I don't feel attacked.
re. claims that anyone who gets 50% of hashing power can destroy bitcoin - I do think that an attacker with 50% of hashing power *and non-economic interests* could effectively destroy bitcoin (destroy trust with doublespending, prevent transactions by only mining empty blocks etc.). However, a mining pool doing this would not survive since the members want to make money from it, and I think we may have reached the point where no single organization is powerful enough to get 50% by itself.
re. fraud by the financial system - most of that would have worked even if the whole world had switched to exclusively using bitcoin instead of currencies. The only difference is that central and regular banks cannot create money, but they can still create derivatives and packages of crappy loans that blow up and kill everything.
You are making a good point that BTC is better for receiving donations semi-anonymously, I probably would not like to post my account number here :D. However, I think your "THE BANK IS STEALING FROM YOU" rant is a bit over the top. Of course the bank can profit/collect interest from what I have in the account, but I'm not obliged to have a certain amount in the account. Given that you don't gain interest on cash either, I don't think the bank is being unfair. Unless you consider the deflationary aspect of BTC to compensate for it, having BTC around with no interest is no different than having EUR in a bank account/wallet. With the difference that one of them is insured by the bank, some kind of FDIC-like scheme, etc., while the other is not.
One think I hope bitcoin will to is forcing the banks to innovate/suck less. Instant transactions, for example, would be a pretty nice thing.
re. volatility: Even the rather low changes in exchange rates between stable currencies are a problem. Not an unsurmountable one, but one that does create an headache and additional costs (e.g. because you have to insure yourself against it, i.e. research the options and pay the corresponding premium/profit for the hedger).
I do think (and hope) that Bitcoin has great potential for the future, but it's kind off a chicken-and-egg problem. My problem is that there are many people who act as if everyone who doesn't drop all existing payment methods and switches to Bitcoin right now is stupid, and currently, that's not really true. (The only reason why it makes sense for merchants is because there are people willing to push its adoption even if it is inconvenient.)

Also, I'm not sure how wide-spread credit cards were outside the US. In Germany, credit cards were and still are very rare. The reason PayPal is so powerful is because it works nearly everywhere.
The problem Bitcoin (and all other non-shitty payment providers) have that they are playing catch-up in a market that already has a well-established, acceptable solution. PayPal had the advantage of being one of the first companies providing this, while that market was still developing, providing the *only* reasonable solution for a problem.

That's a nice theory. Practice shows that practice works like this:
1. There is a bunch of exchanges that get popular, either because they offer a "better" service to a certain market, or do more advertising, or randomly. (Note that "better" is in terms of *visible* factors like ease of transfers.)
2. Noone has a clue how secure they are or not.
3. Sometimes, an exchange like that blows up
Which exchange is more likely to still be there tomorrow: Kraken or Bitstamp? Can you tell?
Sure there are small, untrusted exchanges in addition to that, but it's impossible to compare the security/reliability of the bigger ones as an outsider.

It is a high-risk, speculative investment.
If could totally collapse, or go to the moon. Considering these possibilities and probabilities as currently estimated, the market decided that Bitcoins are worth ~800 USD each.
If you invest, and it goes to the moon, you will make a lot of money. If it crashes, you will lose a lot of money.
The most important advice is: Do not put more money into it than you can comfortably afford to lose. If you think you would be calling the suicide hotline (top post here during one of the last crashes) after you lose everything you put in, you put in way too much.
Edit: Also, you probably do not want to try and get rich by "daytrading", i.e. reacting to small changes in the value by buying/selling. You will probably lose money that way.

When you log in, the server needs to know that you are you when you reload the page. Thus, you get a session ID assigned during login. On subsequent requests, you send the session ID, the server looks it up in his table and sees "ok, this is ForestOfGrins who already logged in", and allows you to use the site as you.
Thus, if someone has your session ID, until you log out, they can use your account. This is one of the reasons why web sites tell you to log out after use - to limit the timeframe in which someone can abuse leaked/stolen session IDs.
Some servers restrict a session to an IP. Thus, the server would notice "ok, this is ForestOfGrins who already logged in from IP 1.2.3.4, but this guy is coming from 5.6.7.8, I'm gonna invalidate the session just to be sure". This makes it harder for an attacker to hijack your session - unless he shares the same IP, e.g. because he is on the same network. Since sniffing a local network/wifi is quite easy, the chance of stolen sessions being used from the same IP is not that small. Anyways, this *really* sucks if your IP changes all the time (AOL did it for a while because they sent you through constantly changing proxies), since you get logged out constantly. Thus, most sites don't do that anymore.
The real solution is, obviously, to not let people steal the session ID. Thus, you use HTTPS, and put the session ID in cookies (where the user can't see it and the browser ensures it's only sent to the correct site) and not in the friggin' URL where users are going to copy&amp;paste it and where it gets leaked with every click on any external link (may not happen if HTTPS is used, but most misconfigured sites don't).
Putting it in the URL made sense when cookies were badly supported (e.g. 10-15 years ago), or if you wanted to support users who have them disabled *even if this means risking their security*, instead of just showing "To log in, you need to have cookies enabled (duh)".

Sure they are taking a risk, but given a large enough gang, I doubt any non-gang-affiliated victim would pose enough risk to keep them from doing it. It's not *free*, but it's sure easier to take everything a man owns and take him as a slave, than to earn the same through honest labor - if you pick your victim right, i.e. someone who doesn't have a huge bunch of friends who will come to save him.


So they organize, band together. Now we have two gangs, one that likes slaves and rape, and one that does not. Let's assume the one that does not like slaves and rape wins against the slave-rapists. They institute a rule of "no raping". You now have a primitive government.


a) people who don't give a shit as long as they get paid  
b) people who haven't heard of their deeds  
c) who cares, the last guy who didn't want to do business is now in the dungeon and they took what they needed from him.


Now we have two gangs, one that likes slaves and rape, and one that likes slaves and rape even more. The stronger one wins, and your neighbor joins you in their bigger, blacker rape dungeon. They are not completely stupid though - they are not cruel to everyone they encounter, and let the worst scum become members - freemen - to keep the slaves in check. Also, they institute a rule that you may not rape freemen or regular slaves, only slaves in the rape dungeon, and anyone outside. They knock at the door of the next village, and offer a choice between slavery or slaughter. The village resists and their screams are heard throughout the night. The survivors wake up in the dungeon. The next village choses slavery, and while they have to perform hard labor on the fields and in the mines, they get fed and clothed, and treated sort of decently, as long as they play along. Some of them may even become freemen after 10 years! Some slaves join the freemen as warriors during their conquests, knowing that if they don't return victorious, their wife and children will end up in the dungeon.
At this point, either a bigger gang that doesn't like rape manges to get organized and beats this gang (see above for this scenario), or you end up with a "government" (dictatorship) centered around slavery and rape.
**What I'm trying to demonstrate**: People are going to band together, and some kind of government is going to form.

If Germany is your target market, you need to rework the language on the entire site. As a native speaker, the language is unnatural and screams "foreign-made" or "hm, sounds like it's written by the guy who writes the phishing mails". This is really, really bad for trust. Knowing when to translate and when to use English words goes a long way. If you have no good way of fixing it, showing the (professionally written) English page to German customers might be a good idea.
When I try to buy, I'm told I will be waiting 2 weeks for my Bitcoins. I understand your business model might not work without this, but I think it does not work due to this. (In other words, there may be no good way of implementing it - there's a reason why there is no other well-known company doing it.)
In 2 weeks, I can sign up at any other exchange (e.g. Kraken), go through their AML process, send money there, and get coins. Without paying a 10% premium. At least that's the impression I get as a new customer - once the two-day verification process starts taking a week, I'm already somewhat commited.
Also, in the first step, you offer a lot of payment options. Once I click buy, it's credit card only. VERY BAD: In general, credit cards are not a very common payment instrument in Germany. In stores, you pay cash or with your bank card. Online, you pay with Lastschrift (not feasible for you, because reversible), well-known payment providers (Paypal, Sofortüberweisung, GiroPay), Cash-on-delivery, by paying an invoice once you get the goods (large shops aiming at older people) or Vorkasse (rare, small shops, people will avoid this).
The creditguard page (if people look at the URL, they might be put off, but who does...) contains UTF-8 barf instead of Umlaut characters, and spelling errors (lowercase "Kasse" on the button, "Ka**a**rten", "Der einfach Weg" (should be "einfache"), ...)
Obviously, all of these are incredibly risky. Sofortüberweisung may sound safe, but once people start paying with hacked bank accounts, it will not be. Also, Sofortüberweisung is basically doing the same thing that phishers do - you give them your account data, they log into your bank account, spy on your transactions, then send the transaction, posing as you towards the bank. This makes it slightly unpopular with a) banks b) people who know how it works and care about security. **Giropay might work**, since it is actually run by the banks, so you might have a guarantee and they might eat the fraud losses (until they decide they no longer want to do business with you). The others are obviously infeasible for you, except Vorkasse, which would turn you into a normal exchange, basically.
 seems to be a competitor (which I randomly found when searching for guarantees for merchants when using giropay), and they suffer from similar issues (e.g. horrible German). However, they have very low fees. (They are also very new. I expect that they have underestimated the complexity of the issue and will crash and burn in some horrible way, likely involving Sofort demanding fradulent payments back.)
In general, anything that allows hackers to anonymously withdraw money from hacked accounts might be very popular with the wrong kind of customer. Bank account hacking is *very* advanced in Germany, there is malware that uses various tricks to bypass two-factor, and *manipulates the online account statements on the fly to hide the theft*.


You want to avoid this for purely selfish reasons, too: If I bought Bitcoin with a credit card, expecting to be able to get it into my wallet instantly, and was then unexpectedly told that I have to jump through verification hoops and wait a few days until I actually get it, better hope your fees are 0 and/or the price goes up massively... because otherwise you'd get a chargeback.

Regarding your concern about the Android phone getting hacked via the Google account:
The hacker could only upload apps that are in the play store, where they do run some automatic checks. It's probably not bulletproof, but makes some kinds of attacks a lot more work than just cobbling some preexisting pieces together. AFAIK on current Android versions, he would then have no way to actually launch the app remotely on the phone (see the "Plan B" app that was using this backdoor to track stolen phones, it no longer works on current versions).
If he managed to make you click on the app, though, the app would most likely be able to intercept SMS OTPs, but it would not be able to read the keys of Google Authenticator and similar OTP generator apps unless it manages to root your phone. Unless you have an old Android version, this should not happen, and even if you have one, they would need to get the root exploit past the automatic checks in the play store.

MtGox had a lot of trust in the beginning - it was *the* exchange. This has certainly changed, but some trust probably still remains. However, I am afraid the question isn't how much trust MtGox still has among informed people.
When all media proclaim "BITCOIN IS BAD: PEOPLE LOSE BILLIONS TO BANKRUPT EXCHANGE. DO NOT TRUST BITCOIN", it *will* hurt Bitcoin adoption. Thus, it will reduce the value of Bitcoin. Thus, it makes sense to sell before the value goes down. Thus, even well-informed people have a reason to sell. Thus, the value will go down... it's a self-fulfilling prophecy.
The question is - will enough people assume that Bitcoin is going to recover so that they buy when the price is low? This does not just mean that enough people have to trust Bitcoin - it means that enough people have to believe that enough *other* people will believe...

Uhm, MtGox is a marketplace. The purpose of having BTC there is being able to sell and buy it. That part still works, withdrawal doesn't.

A possible solution - if transparently disclosed, and possibly requiring opt-in from the user - would be to perform the buy and hold the BTC for a certain amount of time.

Seriously, unless you are really, really into fucked-up math that can be used to drive mathematicians crazy, just learn the primitives and forget the math.

How the signature is generated and why it's secure - don't bother with it. You may want to know properties of algorithms (security level, key/signature sizes, speed, what happens when you whack it with a quantum comptuer), but you don't need to understand that.

Via malicious web-based attacks like XSS on a site with a password field, or when you already have control over the computer? Source?
[This]( article from 2011 indicates that on Windows, Chrome uses the best mechanism available (to my knowledge).
Once you are in a position to pull saved passwords from the browser via the file system, the user has *long* lost. Whether you have to jump through one or two hoops doesn't matter too much. In the end, the passwords need to be decryptable by the browser, and since the browsers are open source, any obfuscation is rather trivial to break.
Also, both Firefox and Chrome offer to show the saved password - a feature I use on a regular basis when some stupid website again changed their login page to the point where autocomplete fails.

There is no holding company - just a private key that only you know. You can either make one based on a *long* passphrase (like 12+ *random* words long!) or store it as a file on a computer.
If you lose/forget this key, the coins are gone.
Now, for the long-term risks. If a vulnerability is found, there might be a need to change the cryptographic algorithms. If a vulnerability that totally breaks them is found suddenly, or suddenly everyone has quantum computers, Bitcoin is dead, but that is extremely unlikely to happen. What might happen, though, is that the strength of an algorithm becomes more and more questionable. A new algorithm will be introduced, and you can move your coins from vulnerable, old addresses to the new ones. As long as you do that before the "hm, this algorithm is getting kind of weak" turns into "everyone can break it easily", you'll be fine.
However, if you are in prison for 20 years, the old algorithm might get completely broken before you get the opportunity to move your coin, which might lead to your coins getting stolen.
Now, don't get me wrong - there is a perfectly good chance that this will never happen. DES, an encryption algorithm invented in the late 70s, is still as good as it was when it was invented for practical purposes (it had insufficient key length from the beginning, but that is unlikely to be a problem with current algorithms). RSA was invented in 1977 and is still as strong as ever (in fact, you use it whenever you visit reddit). SHA1, from 1995, on the other hand, is broken at the "stop using it level", and will likely be broken in practice soon - though not necessarily in ways that would affect Bitcoin if it used SHA1.
This is just a risk you have to keep in mind when thinking about such long timeframes. Then, of course, there is the risk that Bitcoin loses value for one reason or another.
Why do you want to make it so that you yourself don't have access? You can do so by splitting the key into e.g. 5 parts, of which 3 are needed to actually use the key (Shamir's secret sharing, has already been mentioned). As long as you don't have enough parts to recover the key, you can't access it.
May I ask you for what you are going to prison?

With a software, you need to download it once from a trusted source. If you download the software today, and use it every day from now, and tomorrow the web site of the developer gets hacked, you don't have to care.
With HTML5 wallets, every time you use them, you are basically pulling an unsigned software update, exposing you to this risk every time you use the software.
I stand by my claim that at this time, this is a stupid idea. I like HTML5, and I hope there will be ways to do this securely in the future (e.g. crypto keys stored in the browser that the web app cannot read), but currently, this is a ***bad*** idea.

People have less incentive to spend or invest/lend money. Just letting it sit makes it gain value, without the risks of investment. This kills the economy because businesses can't get loans and people stop buying stuff.

Let me elaborate. 90% of people will continue to live normal, decent lives. Some -significantly more than today- will steal, burgle, maybe rob. But let's say 1% decides that being in a gang violently robbing the 90% is more fun than working at Walmart. Every night, they pick a random house, go there with 20-30 heavily armed people, take everything, and then pick another house. Maybe they realize that shooting and/or raping everyone inside fits their definition of fun, too.
These thugs now live a much nicer life than 99.99% of honest people. Want a nice house? Work for it for 10 years. Or just find someone who did, kill and rape him, his family and his dog, and now you have a nice house.
Honest people won't want to put up with it. In some neighborhoods, everyone hides, hoping they won't be next (they will). In others, neighbors intervene when their neighbors get attacked, but they are outnumbered and join the unpleasant side of the rape-and-pillage-fest. And in some, people found militias. They make their neighborhoods reasonably safe places that grow and prosper. Meanwhile, the gangs grow and prosper on the less lucky neighborhoods.
You think you would never kill a man? Well, you better either join a neighborhood and help defend it, or join a gang, because otherwise no one will protect you and less peaceful individuals might take advantage of you (read: you will get raped, murdered and your property becomes theirs).
At some point, tensions rise within a neighborhood. There may be a violent fight for power, or a peaceful agreement, or the neighborhood splits in two neighborhoods - that either fight to their deaths or coexist peacefully. One way or the other, they need to keep a small army posted to keep the gangs out. The gangs also split and merge, join forces or fight each other. Neighborhoods and gangs impose rules in their areas, and enforce them one way or another, and develop some sort of economy (the gang economy probably includes a lot of looting).
Some groups (gang or neighborhood) perish, some grow. The differences between gangs and defensive neighborhoods become less clear. Some neighborhoods raid others, others coexist. In the end, well-organized and well-defended neighborhoods will prevail. They now call themselves states.
The states fight wars or make trade agreements, some are dictatorships, some democracies. But all have police. Because that prevents the 1% of violent people from ruining it for everyone.

It's definitely the best designed applied cryptography I've ever seen. Actually, I'd say the best overall system I've seen, too. Wouldn't be surprised if Satoshi turned out to be several (Ex-)NSA guys, and I mean that as a compliment. If ECDSA is broken, you're not totally fucked iff you never used the address before (i.e. only the key hash is known) AND you manage to get your tx to a honest majority of miners before a dishonest person can fake a sig and get it out. If you have tested the address before (which is likely advisable to protect against human error), broken ECDSA means your coins are gone.
Broken SHA-256 would fuck a *lot* of things up, not just mining. I think you could change the content of older blocks (as long as you keep the merkele tree root hash identical via collisions), which breaks most critical assumptions of Bitcoin. If it's a slow break, it can probably be fixed though, and might not affect OP even if he cannot apply the fix in time.

Wrong. The BTC address is usually the *hash* of the ECDSA pubkey, using both SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160. There seems to be an exception for the "mining" transaction (first transaction in each block) though, for a reason I don't really understand.

How is this a reason against using your bank account? Scamming you is *much* easier if there is no paper trail.
The main reason why people want to avoid bank accounts is because of some abstract fear that the state might know that they bought bitcoins and this might be bad. If this is not your primary concern, use Bitstamp and send the money there via SEPA.

Two hard drives, a $30 DVB-T receiver or a modded motorola phone, and some freely available software/data is all it takes to sniff GSM and break the A5/1 encryption.
A5/3 is better but not supported by all handsets, and not really secure either (I don't know if any practical attacks are public already, but it is known to be weak.)
Some countermeasures can be taken by network operators that will stop the currently published attack from working. They are not widely deployed.

That's all you *need*, but if you want to, it's reasonable to learn what a hash is (data goes in, number comes out, you cannot find different data that give the same number, nor can you recover the data from the number if the data is random enough), what a signature is, ... and how it all comes together.
If you accept the primitives as black boxes with known properties, you can explain even the gory details of Bitcoin to people with zero clue, if they are interested.

Knowing how it works, I can only say one thing: "Good luck".
It's not impossible that a fatal flaw in the protocol is found, or some devices do stupid things, etc. Just unlikely, given who was involved in the development.
However, even if it does get broken, it will take a while until it is used in real attacks. 2FA is just as phishable as non-2FA if the phisher puts some work into it, and yet few attackers do it.

Manipulating the currency even without having uncontrollable in/deflation first can be useful. Losing this ability due to the Euro has been claimed as one of the big factors that caused the  economic issues in Greece. As with most things in economics, this is disputed, of course.
Uncontrollable inflation is a government overdoing this ("printing way too much money"). This is bad and can not happen in BTC. I have never heard of uncontrollable deflation. Deflation, even if weak, is an issue, and BTC is designed to be so good at holding value that it is designed to be deflationary. That could be a serious issue.

The downside of direct democracy is that it is slow, expensive and inefficient - you really don't want to have millions of people vote on every single minor issue. That's where representative democracy shines. However, it also brings up shit in the form of corruption. That's why I really like the Swiss model - a representative democracy with optional direct democracy that can override it when needed. I think this combines the benefits of both perfectly.
Not only because a referendum can step in and fix it when politicians screw up, but most importantly because politicians know that this possibility exists and will be less willing to screw up to begin with.

Does it really cripple the network, or does it require people to increase their fees?
If miners are including higher-fee transactions over lower-fee transactions, it should be the latter. If miners are not, they can start doing that.

On the other hand, if you do it on 11 AM on Thursday, it will be there next business day, even if it is international. And for most private customers, the fees are the same or less than in Bitcoin: Zero.

No, it's not. **If a computer can display it, it can copy and edit it.** This is true for all DRM schemes - they are *all* security by obscurity.
The only thing the protection feature does is adding a flag saying "dear software used to open this, please don't let the user edit this file". It's up to the software whether it follows the flag or not. 
It additionally obfuscates the file a bit to make it incompatible with standard readers, and force software that wants to read it to use their decryption scheme (the scheme and the key have to be public in order for people to be able to read the file!). Adobe is known for siccing its lawyers on people who release software that uses the decryption scheme and then ignores the flag, but obviously, enough people don't give a shit (and it's questionable whether that's actually enforcable).
The iTextPDF library for PDF parsing/editing has a built-in [flag]( that tells it not to care. It's obviously disabled by default, but also obviously placed in a way that makes it as trivial as it could be to flip it. Basically "our software doesn't do what it's not allowed to do, but you know, there is this huge switch, on the outside wall, with a huge ergonomically shaped handle, and a big red arrow pointing to it, and we're not responsible for what happens when you pull it".
Needless to say, I have a shortcut for a tool like qpdf -decrypt ready to use if some idiot sends me a PDF form that was protected for no reason, because I don't want to fill out my form by hand and noone wants to see my handwriting.
A watermark and an edited font also only make forgery more difficult, but far from impossible. Extracting the glyphs and placing them where you want them is still possible, it's just a PITA.
That said, a thorough forensic analysis of a PDF has a good chance to prove it was edited - it's really hard to make no mistakes at all - but you will need a really good expert if the forger did a good job. Ironically, for image-based PDFs like the one you generated, it might be easiest to just extract the image (after dropping the "protection"), photoshop the image, and regenerate the PDF. This way, there will be no inconsistencies in the PDF that would indicate tampering.
If you need a secure anything, slap a digital signature on it.

@_date: 2014-10-17 05:09:31
Possibly. If you have CAD and want USD, you can convert CAD -&gt; BTC at a certain cost, then BTC -&gt; USD. The catch is that BTC is volatile, i.e. the value of BTC might change in between those two transactions. It might rise or fall by 10% or more. If that's a risk you can take, it's a very simple calculation:
Will the conversion costs with BTC be lower than when using other means? Will the difference be large enough to justify the effort?
Since you will also have some buy/sell spread, determining exact costs will be impossible. It strongly depends on the exchanges you use, and how the rate develops.
It seems you lost around 1000 USD, or 2.6%, on the transfer. That definitely sounds like
a) Bitcoin could be quite a bit cheaper  
b) other transaction methods could be quite a bit cheaper
Look for money transfer and/or FOREX providers, and only compare total amounts including fees and conversion rate (some have no fees but bad conversion rates etc.)
I've had a similar problem recently, and for me, the "old" banking system was clearly the way to go. Find the right combination of two banks where the fees are low, wire it, let the right bank convert it, and I think I paid about $10 + 0.002%
**The entire game changes if one part of your transaction is in BTC.** Want to keep BTC? No selling needed, just buy them with CAD. Your customers have BTC? Make them pay you with BTC, then sell them for USD. Or don't: If your customers are willing to pay in BTC, and you want to keep the money in BTC, your fees are **ZERO**. (Well, the transfer might cost something like 50 cents of tx fees if you want it to happen fast, and you will want to spend some time and hardware for a secure environment.)

Not really. Instead of having 0 confirmations for ~5 minutes on average, you would have "1/20th of a confirmation" in 15 seconds on average. 1/20th is a lot more than 0, and that's fast enough to do away with zero-confirmation payments in many use cases.

Bitcoin does solve the problem partially: *If the receiving party has use for BTC instead of the local currency* (e.g. because local merchants accept it or because they want to send it on), getting the "money" in the person's hand is trivial, and regulatory compliance is easy to ignore (the recipient is an individual, and the sender is abroad).
Also, anyone can become an agent who exchanges BTC for cash in both directions. This will likely happen by ignoring compliance regulations in countries that are unable to enforce it. Not necessarily good, but cheap. You are now no longer bound to "A WU agent" but can pick *any* such exchanger.
Building a company that offers to accept cash in location A and dispense cash in location B while using bitcoin invisibly in the middle, however, is horrifyingly stupid, since it carefully avoids all the advantages while keeping all the disadvantages (e.g. exposure to regulation, need for agents) and adding some new ones (exchange rate risk, for example).

Most likely recoverable with manual processing unless the QR code was printed without error correction. The question is whether the work required is worth ~$37.
If there were, say, 10 BTC on there, I'm pretty sure it would be recovered unless it's one big smudge. At that value, it would be economically feasible to combine readable parts of the printed letters with readable parts of the QR code to recover the text. At 0.1 BTC and the current value, anything beyond "redraw the QR code and hope it scans" definitely falls into the realm of "someone's probably going to do it, but certainly not for the money".

Another one a few months ago, ~2 days I think, around $8 + 0.02%, including currency conversion (including the difference to mid-market rate). Without the currency conversion, it would be 1 day and nothing again.

No, they don't.
The magic about a cryptographic key is that you can have copies of it, you can split it up so that each piece alone is worthless, and you can make a copy disappear if needed.
If someone breaks into a bank (or diamond storage center) vault, they take what's inside and it's gone.
If someone breaks into the "cold storage room" of a bitcoin "bank", which might be as easy as breaking down a regular, slightly fortified door, they get a hardware security module that is unwilling to give you the key unless you insert three distinct smartcards and provide the corresponding PIN codes. And if you start drilling into it to somehow get the key out, it zeroizes itself. If you hit it with x-rays to burn the key into memory? It zeroizes. If you cool it to do some memory remanence tricks? Zeroized. Apply unstable voltage to trip it up? Meh, not even going to zeroize, just power down until the voltage is stable.
And you better figure out how to get the key out until the exchange finds their backup keys and moves the coins.

PGP is *the* textbook example where these laws were applied. They were much stricter at that time, but they printed the source code as a book and shipped it to Europe in that form, where it was OCRed back, hoping to avoid prosecution under Free Speech rules. They were still the target of prosecution. The ensuing fun became known as the Crypto Wars.
Today, PGP could be freely exported *after making a notification to the BIS*, as quoted above. If Satoshi worked from the US and didn't notify them, e.g. because he wanted to stay anonmymous, and the version of Bitcoin he exported contained any kind of encryption (e.g. wallet encryption), he likely broke laws.

With double spend relays, you wait a second until you get your TX, then another second to see if there are any double-spends, and you're done.

Several reasons:
The 200 W from the CPU are concentrated on a very small area (assuming you're touching the CPU, not the cooler). Of course it gets really, really hot. If you're touching the cooler, then you're touching something that is still significantly warmer than your body, *and built to conduct heat quickly*. Thus, as your finger cools down the spot you're touching, fresh heat rushes in from the rest of the cooler, while the heat in your finger stays relatively close to the surface. Thus, you cool the entire cooler by a few degrees, and very quickly raise the temperature of a small part of your finger by many degrees. Ouch. This is (part of) the reason why touching a 90°C hot piece of dry wood is OK, but touching a 90°C piece of metal will burn you badly. Or why standing in 90°C air is called a sauna, while dunking you in 90°C water is called murder.
If you microwave your CPU and then touch it, it'll hurt too ;)
That's the second part: The microwave generates a lot of heat, distributed over all the food inside. Thus, it gets warm, but not super hot (if you put only a small piece of food into the microwave, it will also heat much faster than if you put a lot in). The food is not as thermally conductive, so the wood vs. metal thing applies again. Although your finger will hurt if you touch food that you microwaved for a while, especially food with a lot of water in it.
If you run the microwave without anything inside (which may damage it), something else will get hot (walls, air, magetron). Quite possibly, this something is hidden inside the case of the microwave so you can't touch it, burn your fingers, and sue the manufacturer. The heat is probably removed by pumping out hot air.

Exactly, and I don't think Bitcoin will replace VISA within the next 10 years, even in the best case scenario. Which is why we won't need VISA-scale TPS any time soon.


A gigabyte every minute would be 10 GB blocks as it is 10 minutes per block, but I get your point. Have you heard of pruning? A full node doesn't have to keep all past blocks, just enough to survive any likely reorg, and the UTXO set. The rest it only needs to download, verify and process once. With 1 GB blocks, a 5 TB HDD would protect you from 1-month reorgs.
Of course, all the past blocks need to be stored somewhere. There are 144 blocks per day, ~53k blocks per year, so 100 MB blocks would need *some* high bandwidth nodes to store 5.3 TB per year. Or rather, it would make sense for each node to store a random subset of blocks, plus a few archive nodes storing it all.
Initial blockchain download is the main problem. If you want to download and verify a block chain of this size yourself, you're going to wait a few weeks (even if you have gigabit internet, since you have to verify the blocks and build the utxo set). This can be mitigated by having publicly vetted snapshots every few months. You could decide to verify it yourself, but you could also skip the initial block download and trust the UTXO snapshot just like you likely trust the prebuilt bitcoind binaries.
It would also be relatively easy to build a node that runs on a cluster of machines to support such big blocks.
But again, we aren't there yet. We don't need 1 GB or even 100 MB blocks right now. 10 MB should be plenty for now. PayPal has 180 TPS. That would require ~60 MB blocks *once we get there*, and it's a *loooooooooooong* way until then. A way that we are unlikely to go with transactions costing more than PayPal's, where PayPal provides fiat to fiat, a payment platform, ... while in Bitcoin all these come on top of the Bitcoin tx cost.

Only problem is that if I buy a $3 coffee with LN every day, I don't just risk $3. I need to refill the channel at some point, using an on chain transaction. That means that if I want to use it meaningfully in that scenario, I'd have to lock at least a month's worth of spending in the channel (rendering it unavailable, thus adding capital cost, and exposing it to being stolen if my LN node misbehaves. If on chain cost goes up further, I will not be able to buy coffee with LN either, unless I want to lock in several hundred dollars or pay a dollar or two extra each month.

I'm running a full node (unless the crappy daemon crashed again), so I decided to look into it. Let's see how bad it's going to be. I would consider a block size increase a good idea (noone likes fees and I want bitcoin to become big), but I don't have a really strong opinion.
20 MB blocks, assuming 100% utilization, means about 20 MB of inbound block data per block, aka per 10 minutes. Probably another 30 MB or so in transactions. Make it 60 MB per 10 minutes, and we're talking about 0.1 MB/s inbound traffic. That's less than 1 MBit. Yeah, I'll live.
Outbound is harder to estimate, because new nodes need to sync the entire blockchain, which makes them download a lot, and not all nodes play nicely (i.e. some only leech). Let's assume double for outbound traffic. That would make it 0.2 MB/s outbound, that's 0.5 TB/month of outbound traffic. Willie hears ya. Willie don't care. I could even still comfortably run that shit from a Raspberry Pi connected to my home DSL line.
And this is all assuming today's bandwidths and traffic pricing (from providers with good prices for bulk traffic).

The US government is not trying with all its force, including the NSA, to stop torrents.
In case you don't remember, the NSA can likely hack any non-airgapped computer in the world with moderate effort.
Let's start to imagine a scenario where the US government decides that a) it doesn't give a shit about public appearance b) it wants Bitcoin *gone*. Let's start with the non-technical ways.
Bitcoin is banned all over the USA. No company with ties to the US can accept or otherwise deal with bitcoin. No US exchanges, no stores delivering to the US and accepting Bitcoin. At the same time, political pressure is used to get other countries to do the same. If they are in a particularily bad mood, running a Bitcoin client on your IP gets you a visit from SWAT.
If they want to be sneaky about it, they just put small obstacles in the way to prevent Bitcoin from becoming a commecial success (e.g. insane AML regulation). Since it is impossible to use it for legal business, it gets used primarily for illegal business now, making it easier to ban it.
After the ban, it is (kind of by definition) only used for illegal business, making it easier to do bad things^TM to people who have anything to do with Bitcoin. Companies that have anything to do with Bitcoin not only can't do anything US-related (including personal travel) - no US-related company (by a very, very broad definition) can have anything to do with the evil Bitcoin companies lest they draw the ire of the US and get their business fucked up. This includes companies that manufacture semiconductors, AKA ASIC miners. Any company involved in making or marketing them can never export anything to the US again. The KNCMiner CEO joins Julian in the Ecuadorean Embassy, but I doubt they actually built the chips themselves. Their supplier (and all others) now no longer does Bitcoin ASICs.
Buying Bitcoins in the US is now more illegal than buying hard drugs, and nearly as difficult (smuggling the coins is easier, but you still have to get the money to the dealer). Most countries that have relationships with the US have now outlawed BTC or made it infeasible to deal with them commercially. There is also little reason to buy BTC if you are in the US. Even if they gain a lot of value, it will be very, very hard to use them.
Given the small market volume, the market would certainly be open to some kind of manipulation/economic warfare.
Now, let's start the technical side. The government likely confiscated a significant number of ASIC miners. They also made it very, very hard to create new ones. Except for themselves, of course. We might now have a 50% attack, with an actor who doesn't want to profit from miner's fees and hoarding coin, but just wants to fuck the network up. Made more powerful by very clever people thinking about how to improve this.
Remaining exchanges get hacked by unknown actors and/or random bad things^TM happen to them and their owners (e.g. getting arrested, child porn mysteriously appearing on their computers, ...). The US govt also collects a lot of coin through these attacks, to be used for manipulation.
Anyone who considered using it as an "oil currency" has changed their minds by now, and for regular citizens, there is absolutely no reason why to even think about Bitcoin.
Oh, and all this in addition to whatever the US is already doing to keep countries from changing away from the US dollar. It's not as if alternatives, e.g. gold, did not exist. It is also all without the US using its quite powerful military to get it's way. "Nice mining farm you got there. Would be a shame if a Hellfire hit it. And your house. While your children are at home. Want to work for us?"

So, the savings come from them helping you defraud Amazon by buying stuff for you through your affiliate link, and you pay a 2.38% fee (or more, see their FAQ).
At least their business model doesn't seem to be centered around money laundering. Similar services before have offered Amazon goods at a discount using credit card fraud. You paid them with easier-to-launder BTC, they ordered the product for you and paid with stolen credit cards or gift cards bought on the black market for BTC at a favorable price because the seller got them through a less-than-honest method, e.g. stolen credit cards.
I wish them best of luck, but I don't think they'll be able to sustain their service (which *will* require them to spend time/money on customer service) at that fee, and any higher fee will likely put almost everyone off. It will also have to deal with abuse (stolen coin laundering into physical goods).

They had a bug in their software. This allowed people to withdraw BTC, make it look like the withdrawal failed (even though it was successful), and thus make Gox send them the BTC again.
Thus, someone stole coins from Gox. Thus, **Gox currently does not have enough coins to pay all the coins people have in their accounts**.
Imagine a company storing gold coins for you. You put 10 gold coins in, they throw them onto a giant heap in their safe and make a record that you may withdraw 10 gold coins.

Some people have a flat rate on electricity. Scummy to abuse it in that way, but still profitable for them. Also, if the heat is put to good use, it's a win-win.

I'll use the same amount of electricity either way, since I need the heat, so why not mine some coins.

This is not true. The original Bitcoin paper explicitly mentions SPV, saying (emphasis mine)

In a post on Bitcointalk, Satoshi [said](


Ironically, in the same post, he also explains and supports zero confirmation payment acceptance, which IIRC certain core members repeatedly tried to kill by making it too risky (e.g. with full RBF).


Storage space is not a problem thanks to pruning. Initial block download is currently the biggest problem.


Not much, because most use SPV (which, again, is not just some ugly hack but was explicitly mentioned in the original paper).

Because the merchant accepting the payment gets shafted by ~3% fees, possibly more, when the card gets used. Also, currency conversion may either have fees or be "free" with the fees hidden in the exchange rate. Then cards get lost/forgotten until they expire so the CC company can keep the money. Also, the money put on the card earns the company interest.
Obviously, it is possible to make a profit of it without fees, so if US prepaid credit cards charge fees, you are getting shafted because they can.

I considered checking that, but since there is no O to compare to, you would have to take the same font, replace the first letter of a word by O (something like Ooger), then place it over the original word, then check the offset. Otherwise, you risk it being a font feature meant to make texts look aligned. It likely is off, but for conclusive proof you would have to go that far (actually, better replace an entire word due to [kerning]( and hope the document isn't justified so you can align it over a space using the next word).

But... that's basically what the block size limit does...
@_date: 2017-02-04 18:01:57
As a big block supporter, I agree that a consensus-based solution is far preferable, although a hard fork will be necessary.
However, it seems that no increase in block size beyond what SegWit provides will ever happen with Core, because pushing people to complicated and problematic off-chain solutions and having transactions cost $0.27 (current suggested fee in my Mycelium wallet) is somehow preferable than raising the block size to keep up with demand and current technology.
Let me reiterate: Apparently, making *everyone* pay $0.27 *for each single transaction* or forcing them onto off-chain solutions that don't provide the security Bitcoin provides is much better than forcing the few people who want to run a full node to spend 3 EUR/month on a server if their home internet is utter third-world-country level (yes, when it comes to Internet, that includes Australia) shit. A 56k modem would be enough to keep up with ~3 MB blocks (on average, so you would be a bit behind and couldn't mine). In practice, only miners, exchanges, payment providers and large merchants will want to run a full node, and they'll be running servers anyways. So instead of having the handful of people who want to do a stupid thing pay the equivalent of the current cost of 12 Bitcoin transactions per month, *every single user* is being taxed at a fee that rivals PayPal.
Segwit can only provide a minor, one-time increase. It will not provide meaningful relief. If Core were willing to talk about a meaningful long-term increase, most Unlimited supporters would be happy to agree on a plan for that. So far, all that we've heard is over a year of stalling, stalling, stalling and proposals that would mean an increase starting in 2024.
However, it seems like breaking this stagnation through a fork will likely be the only way Bitcoin can grow. It will be painful, but it's better than the current situation.

Nope, I don't think the problem is well known here. Cards are not really known as a way to make debt here, it's a way to pay. Debit cards (bank account cards/EC cards) are more common than credit cards, and even what we call credit cards might actually be debit cards.

You're most likely not bandwidth constrained (if you were, you should not call your Internet fast if it can't transfer 100 GB in a day).

You mentioned "uninstalling" but then you mention a factory reset. If you factory reset your phone and your phone implements the factory reset properly, your coins are 100% gone if you didn't write the seed down anywhere. The entire point of a factory reset is to securely erase everything on the phone.
What phone, what Android version, what did you do, and how much BTC did you lose (in other words, how much money does it make sense to spend in an attempt to recover anything)?
If you got "viruses" on it chances are you have a shitty phone and an outdated Android version that doesn't implement all security measures correctly, and/or you had it rooted. Gives you a slightly better chance to get your coins back, but that still might mean "if you tear the phone apart and rip the flash out you *might* get something" vs. "nope, you're fucked".

I'd go with the Raspberry. It's a full Linux computer, i.e. easy to run "mainstream" code on it, and it has no built-in writeable persisten storage, i.e. you can be sure it doesn't remember your private key after poweroff if you remove the SD card before entering your seed.
I wouldn't fully trust the PRNG on any embedded platform. Ideally, you should generate your seed using some diceware-like method.
HOWEVER, unless you are into making everything yourself, I'd suggest going with a mainstream solution like Trezor. It's just a lot easier to use.

It's going to make transactions more expensive, which means that some transactions will suddenly no longer be worth it, which means there will be less transactions, means that the fraction of transactions that do get confirmed increases.

Yep, looks like you're pwned. Now how to clean it up.
Consider your coins gone. Of course you can report it to law enforcement, and if they catch whoever stole it you would theoretically have a chance at getting something back, but the chances of that are about zero.
What's important now is how to clean things up. 
Back up data you want to keep (preferably using a Linux live CD). Do not back up executables, be careful with complex potentially infectable formats (primarily office documents). If you want to preserve forensic evidence, keep a full image of the hard drive or replace the drive and keep the old one. Otherwise, wipe it.
Do not attempt to clean the infection to avoid the hassle of reinstalling. You don't know how you got infected, you don't know what else is wrong with the machine. You *probably* don't need to throw away the hardware, since regular crimeware doesn't do any advanced hardware-level persistence, but for the love of everything that is holy, nuke the system from orbit.
Scan the backed up data with multiple scanners before restoring.
**Most importantly**: Any password or cryptographic key that touched the computer is compromised. That also means all of your Bitcoin addresses - coins sent to them in the future will likely also be stolen.

 and  for cross-VM side channel attacks in general.  for cloud.
This is one of the vulnerabilities that everyone in IT security knows about, but noone wants to believe they will be used in practice/think about it, because it would really suck, so it's easier to close one's eyes. At the same time, it's boring for academic researchers - it's already been proven to work in theory, nothing to do here. Just like the weaknesses of MD5, which were well-known and well-ignored until someone actually created a fake certificate with it and it was impossible to ignore.
A team around Adi Shamir, one of the inventors of RSA, demonstrated that they can [steal an RSA encryption key just by listening]( to the noise the computer makes. Quote: "We have used a mobile phone to acoustically extract keys from a laptop at a distance of 30cm"
This is well known. This is old. But noone wants to do something about it because it's damn fucking difficult, so everyone is just staring at the wall and pretending the problem doesn't exist.
These attacks are pretty hard in practice, and the benefit to be gained for private individuals from breaking a single crypto key is usually limited, which is why the "la la la, I'm not listening" approach is working *so far*.

I'm sorry for your loss, but this is AMAZING. For anyone who does not know how SofortÜberweisung works: They ask you to give them (i.e. a third party) your bank login data (account number and PIN), then log in with this information, [snoop around a bit]( and then initiate a transfer in your name, asking you for whatever confirmation method your bank uses (usually some kind of one-time password).
IMHO, long ago, banks should have firewalled their IPs and done exactly what they are doing now to their transactions. What Sofortüberweisung is doing is, on a technical level, the same thing that banking trojans and phishers are doing.
They probably started doing it now because BTC is a great way to make stolen money disappear, and Sofortüberweisung is a good way to make it happen instantly. Probably, people were using it to empty compromised accounts, and since the transactions are coming from Sofortüberweisung, banks cannot apply usual fraud detection like checking if the user is coming from his usual ISP and user agent etc.
Ask Sofortüberweisung if they want to cover your loss (spoiler: of course not, they covered their arse in their T&amp;C pretty well).

Germany did it too, until the implementation was ruled unconstitutional - not because it would be unconstitutional in general, but because they took *too little* from real estate owners, putting others at an unfair disadvantage.
Assuming you have 100,000 EUR in your bank account, and your bank charges you 3 EUR of fees per month, your bank "confiscates" 0.036%. Obviously, this is more if you are poor.
TL;DR: Sensationalist title.
Edit: Aaaand aparently it is bullshit, see [this comment]( - it's a tax on banks which they will be unable to pass off to consumers.

Using Bitcoin would probably be a Bad Idea^TM for them: If the Russian government is already looking for an excuse to crack down and arrest everyone in your organization, using a cryptocurrency that the government is already taking action against, and receiving/exchanging large amounts of money through it, is just providing them the excuse and asking to end up in Siberia.
Bitcoin is perfectly capable of getting the money to them. It is also capable to do it in a somewhat covert way, but since they're already under surveillance, and the government can simply require that they prove how/where they got the money, none of this will help.
Bitcoin can solve a lot of problems, but "government wants you taken down" is not one of them.

Just for the sake of explaining it, let's say it's January 20**14** and the server holding they key is exposing a HTTPS server. The HTTPS server logs every request. Someone discovers heartbleed and instead of reporting it, runs it against the server. There will be no logs of this, since no HTTP request was sent and noone except the NSA logs TLS session establishments, but the key will still be stolen. Good luck finding that. Heartbleed is by far not the only thing that doesn't leave logs.
Another thing that doesn't leave logs is having generated the key with a weak PRNG, because your infrastructure is never accessed. However, if you don't figure that out, and generate a new key using the same PRNG, your coins will get stolen again.


Sure. You have log entries like this, slightly simplified:
    2014-01-03T12:11:34Z keyserver1 203.0.113.17 GET /?{whatever-shellshock-looks-like}
    2014-01-03T12:12:21Z keyserver1 uploaded hotwallet.dat to 203.0.113.17
Then you will have the information that at 2014-01-03T15:51Z, someone signed a tx stealing all your coins. How does that help you determine whether two years ago, the guy who set up the server (including syslog forwarding) made a copy of the key? Or a harmless-looking command that won't show up in any automated log analysis was used to steal it after the workstation of an admin was pwned?
@_date: 2015-01-08 21:06:14
Fuck yes. Figuring out what happened, how the intruder got in, what other means of access he might have left behind (e.g. backdoors in some source code, inserted long before the visible theft) takes time even if you already have a highly skilled, in-house incident response team with forensics experience, good knowledge of your systems, logging in place etc. Finding *some* of it is difficult, but not incredibly so. Finding *all* of it is much more difficult. Being *sure* you found all of it, way more difficult again.
Especially when you are putting the existence of your business and 100k+ BTC (&gt; 30 million dollars) on the line.

You always have to trust in something. You can't really verify a modern CPU either, let alone the firmware. If you do trust the CPU, you could use SGX to remotely verify the datacenter and keep it from accessing or messing with your data.


Just to clarify, there's no need for that to be able to run the node there - the node doesn't need keys. Assuming you meant it as an analogy, sure, if you don't want to trust the DC where you most likely already run all the other software if you're a large merchant, you could:
* Treat the node as untrusted and use it to provide data for SPV which you'd crosscheck against block headers from other nodes
* Put tamper proof hardware you trust there (this will cost more, obviously).
However, if you're worried about a bad datacenter, you really shouldn't run the node from home either, because an attack on your Internet connection is much more likely. If all nodes you ever connect to belong to an attacker due to your internet connection being under their full control, you can also be sent blocks from a failed fork (dead branch).

To be honest, I would go all in and explain the entire thing, only treating the crypto as black boxes (I.e. explain what it does, but not how).

A can now write "I send 20 dollars to B" and sign it,  now everyone knows A has 80 and B 20...)
You may want to abstract mining and protection against changes (there is more technology where many people invest computing power, this makes it impossible to change the whiteboard or retroactively insert transactions). If they want the gory details, proof of work is easy to understand.

Not true if the phone implements the factory reset correctly. If it implements it 100% correctly, it will issue commands to the eMMC (flash) that tell it to physically erase the data. At that point, the data is unrecoverable by all practical means.
Most devices with semi-current Android version [implement it well enough]( for the data partition (which is where they key resides) that software-only recovery is impossible. Some of them may be flawed and allow attacks that involve desoldering the flash and reading it directly, while others probably get even that part right, meaning no recovery is possible.


is not as easy as you make it sound. The phone is designed not to let you do that unless you unlock the bootloader, which is required to securely delete the flash at least to the point of logical sanitization, i.e. you'd only read back zeros. (And AFAIK this is tested before a phone gets Play store access.)
You basically need a rooted phone to do that. If it's not already rooted, you'll have to root it via an exploit, which may not be possible if the phone has the latest security updates.

I'm pretty sure that's not the case, but I lack the mathematics knowledge to prove it. It would be the case if you just assumed "how much hash power do I need to make a chain this long", but we're talking about chance here, and I think that the smaller the blocks, the less likely "freak accidents" with the evil miner getting enough blocks in a row before the good miners do become.
One major benefit though is that you get true on-the-blockchain confirmations in 1 minute instead of 5 minutes. The difference in trust between "tx in mempool" and "tx in one block" is massive IMHO.

A Pentium II is a general-purpose CPU, while ASIC mining hardware is special-purpose, i.e. can only be used for one thing. Unless the sculputre specifically requires SHA256 breaking (which is... unlikely, since it was built before SHA256 was invented), a Pentium II would still be preferable to ASIC miners.
Now, FPGA miners, or more generally FPGAs, could be useful if a lot of brute-forcing was involved, but since the problem is finding the right algorithm, not bruteforcing a key, even that would be of very little help. The same applies to GPUs.
There are probably sub-problems that could be solved (or proven to be dead ends) by throwing computing power at them, but it would likely take longer to write FPGA/GPU-compatible code for them than to just run them in an inefficient Python script on a single core overnight.

The idea is relatively simple if you leave out the cancellation transactions:
 * You lock some Bitcoin in a "channel"
 * You then transact on the channel by giving the other party a set of transactions that would "write" the current state to the blockchain, but you DON'T broadcast them as long as the other party is cooperating.
 * If you want to settle or the other party goes uncooperative, you can broadcast the transactions and everyone gets their coins.
In simple terms, you both pay 0.5 bitcoin into a multisig address, and create (but don't broadcast!) a tx that sends 0.5 bitcoin from that address to each of you. If you want to send the other party 0.1 bitcoin, you create a new tx that would send you 0.4 and the other party 0.6.
The problems begin because you could broadcast old states that are more beneficial to you (in this case, you could broadcast the first tx, getting 0.5 instead of 0.4). To prevent that, the settlement is not instant and "cancellation" transactions are created for old states. These have to be sent between the (invalid/old) settlement being attempted and it succeeding.
If a big hub stops being cooperative, everyone will try to settle on the chain - which is already overloaded now, so it certainly will be overloaded when Lightning makes 10x the volume possible by moving it off chain, and the failure now forces all those new users to settle on the chain. Thus, some of the transactions will not go through in a timely manner, making the entire "cancellation" system that provides the security guarantees in Lightning moot. There are some attempts to design ugly hacks around it, but I don't expect any of them to work reliably.
How these actually work:
In the example above, let's call the initial state where both are supposed to get 0.5 BTC each from the channel *state A*, and the new state where you get 0.4 and the other party gets 0.6 *state B*. For each state, there is not one settlement transaction, but two sets of them. Let's call them A_you, A_they etc.
A_you consists of: One tx A_you1 sending the coins to intermediate address I_you, and one tx A_you2 sending 0.5 to you, 0.5 to them, from I_you, *one week after the previous transaction got into the block*.
A_they is similar, with a different address. Only you have A_you, only they have A_they.
Now you send them the coins, creating new transactions (B_you, B_they) and you need to cancel state A. You do so by creating two more transactions, A_you_cancel and A_they_cancel. The former is used if you attempt to use the state, the latter is used if they attempt to use the state. Only *they* have A_you_cancel, which will send all coins from I_you to *them*.
If everyone behaves, you will either create a new state based on state B, or settle using one of the settlement transactions from state B. But if you fradulently broadcast A_you1, the other side will broadcast A_you_cancel within one week, and take your coins. But if you can keep them from broadcasting A_you_cancel, you can broadcast A_you2 a week later, and cause 0.5 instead of 0.4 btc to go to you.

For the current situation and the next few years, on chain scaling is absolutely sufficient. Bitcoin isn't going to become the primary payment system any time soon, and aside from the quadratic complexity attack (solved in both BU and SW), huge blocks (tens of MB) would work fine.
The problem Bitcoin has is adoption. Adding barriers to entry for users (first buy Bitcoin, now pick a LN node and lock your coins up in a channel, now monitor the channel constantly, now hope there is a route between your channel and the place you want to pay) is not going to help.
Sure, if Bitcoin were to scale to a global payment system, we would need both on and off chain scaling. But the more Bitcoin is choked, and the more complex the ecosystem becomes, the less likely it is that it will succeed.
A contentious fork would of course also be bad for Bitcoin - see my other posts, I think the BU fans would be happy to avoid it, but they don't see a way to do so.
Also, I like how you accuse me of hating Bitcoin, while suggesting a non-Bitcoin solution instead. LN is not Bitcoin. It's a layer that uses Bitcoin, but it is a separate payment system. BTW, those nodes will also want to see some fees for their services, it fragments users and merchants into those who use it and those who don't, and the entire fight to get merchants to adopt it starts anew. I doubt using LN will make sense over other systems (Paypal, altcoins, ...).

Assuming disk usage and traffic increase twentyfold, my server won't care. If the CPU usage increases twentyfold, I'll have to switch providers to a *cheaper* one that has faster CPUs (didn't bother to switch because the price difference is not that big and my CPU is not under a lot of load).
Currently, the full node falls under the "background noise" category on that box, and what I said above is under the assumption that the server continues to serve its main task, which isn't Bitcoin.
At home, I'm not running a full node because I don't need it and don't want to spare the storage. If I wanted to run one, a disk isn't that expensive and 2 MB/min = 270 kbit/s is neglegible.

Not necessarily. The first alert they got was "database locked", so they look what is locking it, and they have the attacker copying data. The first alert Bitstamp got is "your bitcoins have moved". That doesn't tell them whether their key was stolen, whether someone told their machine to send the coins, ...
Also, not everything leaves traces in logs. Shellshock does. Heartbleed, for example, did not. Exploits often do not.




No, logs don't help you knowing that, that's my point. 
Logs tell you that the attacker did get one copy of the key from the shellshocked machine. They don't tell you the attacker didn't already have a copy before, stolen from another machine, and is just creating a false lead.

AFAIK if it is implemented as a soft fork, then *you* could decide to implement it right now and start using it on the main chain.
However, as long as the majority of the miners does not implement it, anyone could spend your coins, and that tx would make it into the longest chain, since Softfork-SegWitness transactions are anyone-can-spend to the rest of the network.
Thus, the idea is that it will activate when a supermajority of miners supports it. Thus, the miners decide.
However, a lot of miners have a very strong preference for blindly following what the developers do. It seems like miners are planning to switch to it-that-must-not-be-named-here, so I'd say the devs of that fork will ultimately be responsible for making the call (unless Core decides that they'd like to continue being relevant and release a 2 MB hardfork increase, or manage to both implement Segwitness and convince the miners that that is a good idea and sufficient to alleviate block size pressure).

The ETH Zurich estimates cost of living in Zurich to be 2250 CHF/month for a single person, assuming a rather low number for rent (you won't get a decent appartment in Zurich for that, but maybe a room in a shared appartment, a tiny and decrepit appartment, or something far outside the city).
A cashier at a supermarket makes around 4000 CHF/month.
If the 2500 were taxed, it would probably be a reasonable amount to guarantee a minimum standard of living but not more.

Yes, but it's just an accounting trick. Whether you raise the blocksize to 4 MB without segwit, or to 3 MB + segwit (assuming segwit gives you a 1.5x improvement) doesn't matter. And it's possible to do segwit while counting the witness fully against the blocksize, which means you can do an explicit increase to exactly 4 MB with or without segwit.

Since it was designed to be recoverable from a VHS recording or a microphone placed in front of the TV, I could imagine that it is still decodable. Especially if you use a decoder built to deal with distorted signals - the decoders back then were likely very simple, while we can just throw our CPU at it and have it do a high-resolution FFT of the signal and then analyze that.

I know I will likely be downvoted into oblivion for saying this, but still...
We have tax laws, which were - more or less - democratically decided. Companies and rich people already use tricks to avoid paying taxes, and there is always an outcry about this. Now, however, if the government is trying to enforce tax laws, there is also an outcry. Guess what, enforcement has unwanted effects, like the AML crap we all hate and having to declare your cash at the airport. However, without enforcement, who would pay the taxes needed to keep a state running?
The state that pays the police, by the way. The police who often abuses their power, sometimes murders people for no reason, and usually does not really help solve a crime that happened to you. And yet this police is part of the reason why you can be reasonably sure that the neighbor who hates you won't come over and shoot you in your sleep, even if you cannot afford a body guard. The reason why the rich and powerful pay any taxes at all, instead of just having you picked up by some thugs and thrown into an arena for their personal entertainment.
Shitting on the state is nice and fine, until you consider how anarchy would look like.

Alright. Fuck this, I now have a the recording as a raw audio file (recorded it from Youtube with Audacity, then saved as raw), and a python program that decodes the bytes.
The only missing part is implementing their block format, which is described [here]( As you can see, from the 0x2a byte and the decoding below, the bit order is "reverse" from what we are used to write - the lowest-value bit is transmitted first. Other than that, the machine seems to speak ASCII, which means one less fucked up thing to decode.
Pre-posting edit: And the block format is implemented. I'm not checking the CRC yet (and may never do it), but the data is sent twice and the blocks from the first and second transmission match.
The data itself seems to be a binary format with readable strings. You'd need an emulator for that.
I verified the CRCs manually using an external CRC calculating tool and they match. I am thus confident that the data was decoded correctly.
The Load address given in the header is ffff1900, the Execution address is ffff8023, according to my decoding. I did not verify the header CRC nor do I have a way to check the correctness of my header parser.
The data is 923 byte long and follows in base64:

Sofortüberweisung takes your login ID and PIN (which you should never give to third parties, like Sofortüberweisung), and uses that to log into your online banking account under your identity. Then they take a peek at your account balance [and the transactions you made in the last 30 days]( and initiate a money transfer. They then tell the seller that they did so.
Just as if you did the transfer yourself, it takes some time to execute it (i.e. usually overnight). If you call them, you can cancel it.
Since Sofortüberweisung is, on a technical level, doing exactly the same thing as phishers, I'm not surprised it triggers anti-abuse protections.

The problem is that it is very, very hard for a customer to judge the security of an exchange before it is too late.

Their attack was pretty well-contained. They had a lead on the attacker right away, because he screwed up their database and left an obvious trace. Since they were running on AWS, and the attacker was mostly using their API, they knew what the attacker could have accessed and what not. If the stolen API key was machine-specific, they also immediately knew from the first glance at the logs what he breached to get the key. Shellshock leaves pretty obvious traces in logs, so identifying that was not that hard, and since the issue didn't affect the rest of their infrastructure, they could easily fix this by taking the vulnerable box offline. The only compromised hosts were the VM the attacker created, and the old test host.
If the stolen API key was not machine specific, then I wonder how they know that the attacker got it from the shellshocked machine. It could just as well be from a compromised admin's workstation, with the shellshock just put there to provide an alternative explanation and keep that compromise secret.
Most importantly, though, they lose a lot of money by being offline, and don't lose much by getting hacked. Thus, a small amount of residual risk (e.g. not being 100% sure the attacker only got the key from the shellshocked box) is significantly more acceptable than at Bitstamp.
Bitstamp also took the (correct) decision to rebuild their infrastructure instead of trying to clean up the breached one. That takes additional time.
Also, this really, really irks me:


bcrypt massively slows down attacks, but if the attacker has compromised another AWS account and can spin up hosts that he doesn't have to pay for, he can still do quite a bit of dictionary attacking. It's unlikely that he's going to have a lot of success, but claiming it cannot be cracked is still something they really shouldn't do.

Kasse means a lot of things, but box is not really one of them. The thing the cashier uses to enter prices and store cash is called a Kasse, as is the entire cashier's desk.

I'm not following the current entertainment too closely, but I noticed that the line simply appeared in the white space without moving the signature area below. Since I've got better things to do which need procrastinting, I decided to load a screencap into Inkscape and overlay equally spaced lines.
This "only" means that the line was very likely added with a PDF editing program, which was already pretty obvious due to the digital signature.
The only new information is that v8 was liekly not generated by changing the original, converting it to PDF, then copying over the signature, but by editing the PDF.
Of course, it does not prove anything, technically. Maybe Roger was just too lazy to re-sign the contract or something and decided that PDF-editing a digitally signed document was the way to go.
Maybe also OKCoin agreed with Roger to make the change, added the line, then sent it to Roger, who sent it back as a sign of consent without resigning it.
Whether any of these make sense, given that Roger knows how to use digital signatures, ... who am I to judge that? ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
Also, I took no great steps to verify the authenticity of the v8 PDF I used, so feel free to reproduce the experiment if you want to be sure. The button you're looking for can be found in the alignment toolbox, it will be called something like "remove overlap". Just paste a few lines on top of each other, enter distance, press button. To reduce the distance, first put the lines back on top of each other with the align buttons.

I'm actually unsure myself about the use of Cloud for such purposes. On one hand, as you said, it gives you an incredible level of security. On the other hand, it exposes you to some new risks - e.g. compromise of your cloud account, including the risk of social engineering against the cloud provider and rogue employees on their side.
Comparing AWS/EC2 to rented servers is, in my opinion, missing the point. IMHO, anyone considering to operate a high-value BTC related service like an exchange on a regular rented server should not be running such a service. If your options are to rent some cheap vServer (or even root server) at a random hoster or going with EC2, of course go with EC2.
I would expect sensitive services like an exchange to run on own hardware, but I guess that raises questions of physical security and supply chain attacks.
Seems like dedicated instances are a publicly available feature, so that shoud solve the problem of sidechannel attacks (if they use it), and I'm pretty sure Amazon does a reasonably good job at keeping people inside their VMs so that they can't backdoor the VM host or attack the hardware.

SPV (as mentioned in the original paper) should be good enough - especially if you are willing to accept less secure off-chain methods as an alternative - and is well supported by clients today, I think.
If you do want the extra security of checking yourself (which is more an idelogical than a practical decision IMHO), running a node in a datacenter is really cheap (if you run a pruned one, about 3 EUR/month with plenty of resources to spare for on-chain growth).

That is guaranteed to happen simply because people have set up nodes and forgotten about them. Isn't dangerous though


That would require some serious hashing power. If the people organizing the fork are clever, they do it right after a difficulty adjustment. If they're *really* dedicated and there's a lot of hashpower behind it, they could even contine to use a small percentage of mining power to mine empty blocks on the old chain with spoofed timestamps to double the difficulty again and render the old chain unusable.

You are correct. What is relevant is the *marginal* benefit of mining vs. not mining.
Of course buying new mining equipment won't be worth it, but if your choice is letting the existing equipment run or not letting it run, the only cost you have to consider is the power and the dude poking the miners with a stick if they crash. And from what I've heard the power is close to free for many miners.

OK, now you pushed me over the edge and I want to know. The signal is 1200 and 2400 Hz, I'd guess FSK. But apparently the Ham radio community likes to make their software shareware/commercial, and I'm not running something that may have 15 year old DRM mechanisms on my main machine.
Does anyone know what modulation they used? I really don't feel like just poking around in the dark.

Bitcoin is of limited use for Remittances and money transfer as long as the source and destination have/need the value in fiat, not BTC.
By using Bitcoin, you're just changing a "transfer money and convert currency" problem into a "transfer money and convert currency, twice" problem, since you first need to convert from source to BTC and then from BTC to destination currency. Each conversion carries a cost, both in effort required (and possible unavailablility) and in exchange fees.
You can get similar results by using money transfer providers. Think of them as an exchange that operates in many countries and doesn't actually exchange to BTC...

Since the 1 MB limit was introduced, hardware and bandwidth have improved massively. Since we first hit the 1 MB limit, hardware, bandwidth, and the software itself have improved. We now have (various variants of) thin blocks, giving a roughly 2x improvement in bandwidth usage. libsecp256k1 improved validation speed massively. Pruning reduced disk space requirements.
Each time one poor exucse to block scaling is removed, another increasingly far-fetched one is pulled out of thin air. Anyone able to run a full node when we first started hitting 1 MB (before those improvements) would likely be able to run a 4+ MB node today at the same cost. The above improvements were sold as prerequisites for scaling, "just wait until we get X done then you'll get your scaling", yet the scaling never came.
The newest "argument" was that nodes run outside your home don't count, because there simply was no way to deny that running a node (even with 2, 4 or 8 MB) costs 36 EUR/year on rented hardware. Even then, though: Assuming you want 3x the block bandwidth upstream (which is not really needed), and you only had 1 Mbit upstream (which doesn't even meet the FCC's definition of broadband), this would give you enough bandwidth for 25 MB blocks.
What completely kills decentralization is Lightning. You need to have money locked in a channel to be able to use it. That means that there is a strong incentive to minimize the number of channels you have open. That, plus the effort required to find a reliable path with many hops, means LN will be strongly centralized around large hubs. When such a hub fails (gets compromised or turns evil), everyone will need to settle quickly on a blockchain already operating on the edge of the capacity limit. Anyone who doesn't manage to settle can *lose* their money. I hope you can see why I'm opposed to forcing people onto this sort of second layer by rising fees in Bitcoin proper.

Maybe our definitions of wealthy don't match, but a dedicated node well suited for 2 MB (which is the current proposal) and probably even more costs 6 EUR/month, or can be built for the cost of a Raspberry Pi plus storage, which should be around 100 EUR total). I expect the cost to stay the same as the size goes up but hardware/bandwidth gets cheaper.

I've made [my own detailed estimates here]( backed with calculations, and would love to be proven wrong (with an explanation, not the "hurr durr you're dumb" I've received so far). I think that we could scale Bitcoin to 400 MB(!) blocks given today's top-of-the-line hardware but improved software.
Of course, we don't want to do that *today* because a) very few could afford such hardware, b) the software is not there yet, but in 5-10 years, todays top-of-the-line hardware will be auctioned off on ebay for scrap value, and we will have had time to improve the software to handle it.

There are very good technical arguments against SW, many of which have been pointed out in this thread.
*In addition* to these technical arguments, people are *also* vary because the (complex, thus risky) proposal comes from an actor perceived as untrustworthy.
That said, many people still do believe SW is a good idea. I think that implemented properly and with the pressure of the block size debate removed, it *might* still be worth it, but it's a horrible idea to shoehorn it in now.

How is that? What prevents an attacker to use one of the anyone-can-spend outputs from a SegWitness transaction, use it to pay the merchant using a non-upgraded node (and repeat 20 times until he gets lucky and his tx gets mined by one of the remaining pre-fork miners in case the victim doesn't do 0-conf)?

Changing the PoW is a hard fork. Thus, changing the PoW after a BU fork would mean that there would be 3 coins: BU, the original Bitcoin, and PoWcoin.
The latter could not claim to be *the* original Bitcoin, which is one major selling point for the non-forked chain. It also would not be protected by massive hashrates, making it vulnerable to 51% attacks by entities with a lot of CPU or GPU. These two facts together would make it very hard to get exchanges and payment providers to support it.
If opponents of BU could agree on a PoW change, this would be great. Neither fork could claim the moral high ground of being the original, the original block chain would die cleanly, and we could all get on with our lives.

The price randomly hops up and down for no particular reason all the time. Attempting to attribute changes to such events is most likely supported mainly by confirmation bias, since there rarely is a fixed date for when a contentious hardfork is "proposed". Pick the right dates, and the price falls.
In the first half of November, the price temporarily rose 50% and immediately fell back again to the previous level. Then the price doubled again for no reason between Nov 25 and ~Dec 15. Now it's falling but still above the Nov 25 levels.
It also rose sharply over the last 4 months, and is still higher than it was at any time in Q3 2015. Stop attributing random fluctuations to news.
Or don't, but then also feel free to attribute it e.g. to the news about blocksize running out, Mike Hearn's article (which is not the result of a hardfork, rather a result of Core's inaction - and also much more lilkely to actually have scared big investors away), or the local weather.

Let's assume a factor of 3 over raw block bandwidth to cover transactions and protocol overhead. Especially with thin blocks this will most likely be closer to something like 1.2, but let's be conservative here.
That means roughly 100 MB per 10 minutes of downstream bandwidth to operate a full node. 10 MB per minute. That's less than 1.5 Mbit/s.
Of course, if you want blocks to arrive quickly, you need either a lot more bandwidth - or thin blocks. But 1.5 Mbit/s downsteam is all the bandwidth you need for a full node to be able to keep up with actually filled up 32 MB blocks *and unconfirmed transactions*.
I agree that 32 MB is not worth the risk *today*, but I've [made my own estimates]( and think that the long-term plan could, without undue risk, include on-chain scaling up to hundreds of megabytes.
@_date: 2016-03-13 22:54:14
The point is that if x MB would require technical advances that are uncertain and far in the future, then we couldn't be sure that this sort of scaling will be possible if Bitcoin does grow.
However, if *even with the limited hardware from today* it would be possible to scale, and the only problem is the software and current cost of the hardware, then it's pretty clear that this scaling is possible in the long term - in other words, that by the time we actually need it, we can have it. 
The necessary changes really aren't that complex, and many of the improvements are already being worked on.
Most importantly, the current inefficient software wouldn't allow us to scale to 400 MB, but it certainly wouldn't have much of an issue with 2 or 4 MB, which is all we need for now. And as we fix the inefficiencies one by one, this will approach the 400.

If he's a citizen of the US or another country with ridiculous anti-crypto laws, he might be in trouble for exporting "weapons", because that's what crypto software is legally in the US.
The laws got a lot less retarded in the past years, but they're still there and I think [you still have to do some paperwork before putting up crypto software]( However, since Bitcoin doesn't encrypt anything (at least in the early versions), he might be fine (AFAIK, using crypto for signatures is exempt).
That said, I doubt he would be prosecuted under this law anyways. If he was, I'm pretty sure the law would cease to exist.
I don't think he has much to fear from money transmission laws, but since the US likes to bend laws until they fit...
Tax on assets was mentioned and could indeed be a problem if he didn't pay it.
His legal problems would pale in comparison to other problems. He's holding a significant percentage of all Bitcoins, making him a prime target for various kinds of attacks (including [rubber-hose]( cryptanalysis to break his private key). There are people willing to abduct children in order to get the parents to pay millions in ransom despite the risk of getting caught when the money is to be handed over, you bet there are people willing to beat up a guy to get 200+ millions in easy-to-launder internet money.
I don't think he has much to fear from the CIA &amp; Co - he has no special secret knowledge he can exploit except maybe the alert key which is of little use for covert attacks, attempting to turn him into an asset is extremely risky and probably not too useful anyways since he's out of Bitcoin development... I doubt the CIA murders people just because they did something annoying a few years ago if their murder doesn't change anything.

I think that this is a small part of it, but not more.

Coupled with accusations that Core is acting for corporate interests (Blockstream/Lightning), this distrust makes it very hard to trust an incredibly complex solution, especially if it is presented as a solution to the blocksize problem (which it doesn't solve and which can be fixed much easier by changing a constant).

Assuming the current miner adoption and their percentages, it is likely that [it-that-must-not-be-named here] will get support from over 90% of mining power (assuming Slush and BTCC join). At that point, staying on the old fork bears a lot of risk, since a single big pool could pull off a 51% attack against the old chain and potentially render it useless (just like luke-jr did long ago against an altcoin he didn't like).
The main question is: What will exchanges support? If most big exchanges switch to [it-that-must-not-be-named]-only, "Corecoin" is dead. If enough owners of pre-fork coins dump their "Corecoin" to make it worthless, Corecoin is dead because miners can't profitably mine it and will likely switch over.
What I expect to happen is the hashrate of "Corecoin" collapsing to significantly less than 10%. At 5%, a difficulty adjustment will take 40 weeks (assuming the fork falls on an adjustment date), and until then, a new block will be found ~every 3.3 hours. That's almost a day for a full confirmation, with the constant risk of a 51% attack by a single miner. Also, that's around 600tx/hour, not exactly a lot, especially if a lot of people try dumping their Corecoin.

Ideally, you'd use a recovery seed *and* a passphrase, then store them in separate locations. Or, since you're already doing multisig, accept that one of the seeds could get compromised and store them separately. Or, just remembering the passphrase *and recalling it monthly to make sure you don't forget it*.
You could also try to put the seed in a sealed container/envelope to ensure you can detect if someone accessed it. Secure physical seals are a hard problem though...

The 7B number assumes Bitcoin has won and replaced basically all payment systems worldwide. That is unlikely to happen any time soon. I think with improved software, we could scale to 400 MB blocks - meaning 10% of all worldwide cashless payiments - using hardware that is available today if you have incredible amounts of money and which will be very cheap in 5-10 years.
My reasoning is explained [here]( and I would be very happy if someone could point out things that I have not considered or estimated incorrectly.
Also, if you think 12 GB blocks are unimaginably scary, think how unimaginably scary the concept of a 1 MB block would have been back when a 56k modem was state-of-the-art technology.

The other Chinese miners could also have a well-connected node on the outside. Do the exchange and verification in some datacenter, do the rest in China.
I think latency (300-1000 ms from "the West" to China) and the risk of the GFW fucking with those links, as well as lack of suitable software, might be contributing to not doing this. Also, the fact that they benefit from what is basically a selfish mining attack by mining only on the China side.

I think the logic goes like this: Currently, 0-conf bears some risk, but people are still using it. RBF "fixes" this by making 0-conf so dangerous that noone can/will use it anymore. See? Much better! Also, the invisble hand of the free market will then create new technologies that will allow safe 0-conf, thus improving network security.
Or bitcoin will die because noone is willing to wait between 0 and 48 hours before they can get what they bought, and because the alternative technologies will either not be ready in time, or will introduce greater risks (like lightning which may work while everything is peachy, but will gox everyone if there is ever the equivalent of a bank run).

1, 2 and 4 are correct.
3 is not so clear, as sending one currency will likely also send the other (because the transaction will be valid on both chains, and someone will replay them). If you're not careful, you can lose coins this way while sending.
You will want to either explicitly send both together, or explicitly split them.

True - but I believe at least one of them did colocate... of course, they could have prevented it with a more secure rack, but that's where the reality of finite resources comes in.


Because otherwise a competitor does it, and because customers can't distinguish your company that does it properly from said competitor who can offer better conditions, guess who gets the customers and who gets to go out of business... not saying it's good, but it's true.
It also boils down to an economic choice - some risk is simply not worth avoiding: If you can hire 10 security engineers, or have 1000 Bitcoin stolen by hackers every year... letting the theft happen and eating the cost is probably cheaper at the current price (if you ignore reputational cost).




My point was that you can either have two non-overworked guys do the OS and application stack, or have one of them deal with the rest that AWS &amp; Co. do take care of while the other then fucks up the software.
Of course, that was also not meant literally, the point being that if you have X amount to spend on IT/security/whatever, you *may* be better off delegating some of that security, with all the benefits and risks that brings.


I... I can't even. That's fucked up.
A really interesting question in the getting-owned-thorugh-cloud-provider scenario is one of liability. Even if the cloud provider isn't liable legally, they may be willing to cover the loss to preserve their reputation (otoh, they may *not* be willing to, to avoid setting a precedent).

The *current* form is opt-in, although it's not as simple as you make it seem. Wallets that don't know about it will treat every transaction the same, and the sender decideds whether to opt in or not. Thus, if the recipient has an old wallet, it's easy to scam them even if they didn't opt in.
There are also discussions about (or rather, repeated attempts to merge) full RBF, which is not opt-in and would destroy 0conf. That's what I was talking about.

It introduces a lot more complexity, and it appears that it is being shoehorned into Bitcoin on the back of the block size debate.
It is obviously a bad solution for block size, because the benefit it gives there is a one-time, non-repeatable and small increase. A hard fork will be necessary even with SegWit, so what we should do is hardfork first, then debate the benefits of SegWit on other aspects (malleability fixes etc). vs. the cost paid for it (complexity etc.).
There are also concerns that the main reason why SegWit is being pushed is to promote specific commercial solutions (Lightning, Blockstream sidechains) on top of Bitcoin which are seen as questionable.
@_date: 2017-02-06 18:55:16
It means mining blocks in the sense of creating the actual block data and the corresponding nonce. In a mining pool, only the pool's server "generates" in this sense.
@_date: 2016-01-31 04:46:40
No, it's an accounting trick. Whether you have a block size limit of 1.7 MB or 1 MB + SW resulting in the same effective limit, the load is mostly the same. SW just moves data from one place that counts against the block size to another place that doesn't, the amount of data and thus the load it causes stays roughly the same. (AFAIK you could have a new type of node that's neither full nor purely SPV and that doesn't download witness data, but traffic really isn't the limiting factor and miners still need full nodes.)
Thus, instead of doing the first doubling with SW and the next one with a regular increase, we could just do both with a regular increase, which needs *very* little additional code.
Edit: It also fixes the DoS attack consisting of one large TX with many inputs that takes forever to validate, so it does provide *some* benefits for block processing. Limiting TX size is the easier fix...

If the "more knowledgable group" is committed to not changing the blocksize, and the miners are unwilling to consider any of the forks also made by knowledgable people, I think "the miners are not allowing the block chain to grow" is a valid interpretation. Not  the only valid interpretation, but definitely a valid one.

If the money was in bank accounts initially, follow it as far as you can. If you're lucky, you will see it being sent to an exchange. If that's the case, you'll have to somehow convince the exchange to tell you where the coins are, or give you access to them if they are still there. I suspect this will be hard: The exchange doesn't want to risk getting tricked with a fake death certificate, so I suspect it will be hard to get them to cooperate. If it's a major one, you might be lucky and they may have a procedure for it.
If the money was withdrawn in cash, or the Bitcoin were sent away from the exchange, things become much harder.
Try to find files, paper notes, or special Bitcoin storage hardware. Do not share any words or letters you find anywhere with strangers you don't trust.
If you find twelve random words, you may have found the Bitcoin. If you find a long random string of letters, lower and upper case, you may have found the Bitcoin, or a trace where they might be.
Find a friend who knows about Bitcoin and who you can trust with tens of thousands of dollars. The coins are worth more than they were when you bought them - either by a little bit if you bought them at the previous peak, or WAY way more.

It's actually 923 *bytes* of payload, plus headers, transmitted twice, and as you predicted, very well decodable.
The question, in my eyes, was less whether today's codec mangled it, but whether one of the analog processes that helped get this onto Youtube did.

Depends. If it is split into many outputs, it's worth less because of the fees that have to be paid to use any of it. Theoretically (if a lot of it is small amounts in different outputs) it could be completely worthless. Realistically, he'll probably "only" lose a copuple dollars to fees at worst.

A fork of the software that follows the "longest" chain (the one with the most work) without enforcing a hardcoded block size limit.
Miners set three parameters: the max size of blocks they generate, the max size of blocks they accept immediately, and the number of blocks that need to happen to override the latter (accept depth, AD).
So if a BU client sets both size limits to 1 MB, and the accept depth to 6, it will behave like Core, rejecting (not mining on top of) blocks larger than 1 MB. However, if it sees an otherwise valid chain of 6 blocks larger than 1 MB, and that chain is the longest, it will accept it and start mining on top of it.
Essentially, if a hardfork with &gt; 50% hashpower were to happen, miners with BU would follow it (after a short delay). BU can also be used to initiate the fork - once enough miners agree (out of band), they can simultaneously set their nodes to accept and generate bigger blocks.

It's most likely this standard:

The fact that the start and stop bits are reliably where they should be tells me I've got the right format and likely decoded it *roughly* correctly.

If full RBF is implemented, yes - reversing unconfirmed transactions is already *possible*, but complicated/unreliable enough that most people aren't doing it.
With full RBF implemented (AFAIK being considered for 0.12), it becomes trivial. With opt-in RBF implemented (AFAIK this is already implemented in 0.12), wallets that don't watch for it become scammable. Wallets that watch for it will be able to give you a warning that this transaction is easy to reverse, at which point you have the choice whether to believe your yelling customer who claims he's a newbie who just checked some weird box and thinks that you're scamming him, or a scammer who will reverse the tx once you fall for their fake crying and give them your part of the deal.

If they fuck up badly enough, it does... who knows what kind of setup they have. For example, could have something that distributes "good" blocks across their miners, with a fallback to empty blocks to ensure they can continue maining if the "good block generator" fails. If the generator (or network) is unreliable, this is what you get.
I'm just surprised that the lost fees don't motivate them to fix it. Even if they "only" lose one block worth of fees every day, that should make it worth fixing.

This assumes that either:
a) you're afraid that your cloud provider (as in the company) might try to hack you  
b) you think you will implement better security than your cloud provider will (overall, taking into account issues like insider threats, social engineering of customer support, ...)
You're trading one vulnerability set for another one, the question is which one is bigger, and I think the answer isn't as clear as you may think.
When you colocate, you need to have your own skilled operations and security engineers and local staff to do all this. If your staff fucks up configuring your own firewalls, routers, switches, you will be worse off than if you bought some turnkey solution from a cloud provider and didn't have to deal with the firewall (instead relying on the provider who can afford more security engineers to deal with the firewalls than you have employees in total).
On the other hand, as you pointed out, if you do get it right, the attack surface is much smaller.
The question is: For the same number of employees, which solution will end up being better? If you have 5 people handling your operations, and need to have one of them build a secure cage and maintain the surveillance system, one of them deal with the network perimeter, one of them maintain the hardware, and one of them build a *trusted* way to access that network for management purposes, and one of them handle the OS/software, will that give you a more secure result than having two people deal with the OS/software while 2 set the security settings at the provider to max and the fifth reviews everything, while hoping that the cloud provider holds their part of the bargain and doesn't have a vulnerability that gets you owned?
It doesn't help if you have a perfect cage if your software guy forgets to properly secure the software running on the server because he hasn't slept in weeks...

By definition, any BU-based fork would have to have more hashing power than the Core-based chain (unless the code were to be changed). If the core based chain had more hashpower, no fork would exist since BU would simply follow the Core chain. It's hard to predict which of the forks will have more economic value, of course.

Please do not try to dismiss legitimate, well-informed criticism as trolling. I made my own opted in tx, signed, and broadcast it. My wallet showed no warning. I also know that in the real world, it doesn't matter whether an attack is possible - it matters whether it is easy. The default being to allow RBF would make it easy. Hence, I have good reasons against it.
Also, from the context in which opt in RBF was presented, it appears to be part of the attempt to intentionally "fix" the "blasphemy" of people daring to accept 0conf by making it impossible to use it. Possibly also an attempt to make bitcoin less useful to make commercial alternatives attractive. This taints it further.
@_date: 2016-01-16 06:29:37
Exactly. Signature/hash checking is relatively expensive. The client could also keep the relevant part (inputs used by one of the transactions) of the UTXO set in memory: For each input of a previously seen transaction, it would know whether this input was valid as of the last published block. Thus, when getting the next block, the client would only have to:
* verify the proof of work and merkle root
* check the signatures, general validity, and fetch the UTXO info from disk for each tx it has not seen before, and
* for each tx, replay the changes to the utxo set to ensure transaction parents are included and no utxo's are double-spent (if transaction ordering is arbitrary, i.e. it is allowed to put the parent after the child, maybe it's time to change that).
I don't know if clients already do any of this.
@_date: 2016-01-31 04:25:32
It's a constant factor, so yes, if it gives us an effective block size of e.g. 1.7 now, it would give us an effective block size of 3.4 with 2 MB blocks.
In other words, if we use SW now to "double" the block size, the next time we want to double it, we need to do it by doubling the actual block size through a hardfork - we can't just use SegWit to double it again. On the other hand, we can increase it as many times as we want by adjusting the size limit.
@_date: 2016-01-16 10:33:09
It could provide a one-time, non-repeatable increase, while changing the constant can be easily repeated when resources come. Even with segwitness, we'd have to do this. Segwitness also doesn't make it cheaper to do big blocks - the cost remains the same, it's just a very ugly accounting hack to bypass the block size limit.
For this, we'd pay the high price of complexity and the risk it involves. The risk of changing a constant is limited, the risk of introducing a lot of new code is large.
I also don't see a big benefit of a soft fork vs. a hard fork. SegWitness transactions are not really backwards-compatible. Sure, they'll be valid, but they'll be treated as anyone-can-pay.
If we want SegWitness for reasons other than the artificial block size limit, I think it makes more sense to introduce it as a clean hardfork, instead of building an ugly hack and somehow trying to squeeze it in. We *definitely* should not let it weasel in on the back of the blocksize issue. The root cause for the blocksize issue is a constant. Let's fix the root cause instead of slapping hacks on top of it.

@_date: 2017-03-19 07:42:04
From a technical side, not much.
However, since Core doesn't exactly seem to be a fan of on-chain scaling, many supporters of scaling via block size increase think that if segwit is activated, further on chain scaling will be blocked indefinitely. This is based on the historical unwillingness of Core to increase the block size, and that activating segwit will give Blockstream all they need for off-chain solutions, and thus a strong motivation to strangle the main chain to get people to use them. Since those solutions are inferior (more centralized, less secure) in my (and others') eyes, I consider that a bad thing.
Doing both the hard fork and segwit activation at the same time could be a viable compromise because having one successful fork to point back to would make it much harder to block further on chain increases.

2. First, you have to find some friends. Then, they ask you for the book and you hand it to them.
3. By creating a new wallet with a new seed and sending all the coin from the old wallet to the new one. May require a second wallet device (can be a software wallet if you're willing to take the risk), or writing down the seed, factory resetting the device, generating a new seed, writing down the seed and address, resetting it again to input the old seed, sending the coins, and resetting it again to re-input the new seed.

Yes, however I don't think they're doing it intentionally to choke the network; they're likely doing it because the money they lose on fees is less than the money they'd lose by waiting (or rather, because they can't build blocks fast enough).

Which gives us a one-time increase in effective blocksize, and everything after that needs to happen off chain. People will be pushed towards commercial off-chain solutions that don't provide the same security as real Bitcoin, and the companies behind said solutions will have every incentive to block any further on-chain scaling.
@_date: 2016-01-16 13:05:15


So, the miners *can* time it. And the developers can time it by adding code that supports such behavior (e.g. "new limit activates on the first adjustment where the previous n blocks have shown at least 85% miner support AND first block MUST be &gt;1MB").


Yes, that's the point - if 90% of hashing power drop out right after an adjustment, the old chain will be almost unusable since blocks will be found ~once per 100 minutes, and that state will remain for ~20 weeks, then 10 more weeks with blocks every ~50 minutes, then 5 more with blocks every ~25 minutes, ...
If they then dedicate ~12% of their mining power to mining empty blocks with spoofed timestamps on the old chain for ~20 weeks, they could additionally double the difficulty to "salt the earth".
Or just announce that any non-empty chain will receive a 50% attack, and follow through once or twice by diverting significantly more hashing power for shorter periods of time while the new block chain doesn't need blocks urgently.

The bandwidth limitations aren't *that* bad if you're using efficient network protocols (i.e. not standard Bitcoin clients but rather something like the Block Relay Network), **which they are using**.
I suspect that if one were to look at the real issues, minor improvements to the block relay network and to the client (e.g. verify transactions as they arrive, don't re-verify signatures and hashes when the block containing them comes, use multi-threaded verification where useful) would make a block size increase to 32 MB and more a non-issue, assuming the DoS using large transactions with thousands of inputs were solved (e.g. by setting a 100 KB hard limit on max tx size for new blocks).

With Lightning, you'd only have to publish one set of transactions per channel to close it out. Thus, if you use a channel a lot, broadcasting the set of tx's to close it would be much cheaper than doing all the transactions on the chain. Also, Lightning transactions are instant, because you give the other side a "weapon" to take all your coins in the channel if you violate the protocol.
The downside is that if a lot of people need to settle in a short time because a large counterparty with a lot of channels fails/defects, the blockchain will get clogged and you won't get your settlement into the chain in time. Certain aspects of lightning require you to get the settlement onto the chain within a certain time, and if you don't, a malicious counterparty can steal your funds.

Good luck finding an IT student who'll work for you for free/below market. Unless of course the university pays the difference.
You also need a *good* developer who knows a bit about security, and you need at least one such person to be a part of the team, not just a random guy who wrote the code for cheap. If the IT guy considers your idea to be stupid, it might be.
Also keep in mind that ideas are a dime a dozen. Every person in IT I know has *way* more ideas than they could ever implement. Also, many IT students probably don't appreciate the value of someone with economics knowledge in a startup. In my experience, this is probably even worse amongs skilled and security-focused students, although that might be different in Switzerland.
Especially if you don't have experience and connections, being successful with a startup is tough, *even if* your idea is great (most really aren't). You need a lot of luck, get the marketing right, a great idea, great execution, ...

**A Call For Core Developers to Clarify Their Stance on 2MB Hard Fork**
Before we dive into it, please be reminded that this piece of writing is an effort to improve understanding and engage in discourse in an open, candid and transparent fashion.
This is no veiled threat, neither is it moral grandstanding.
Use of inflammatory language, argumentum ad passions, FUD, or downright character assassination will be out of the question, as they will only be counterproductive to the aforementioned purpose.
We will try to stick to basic facts that are clear and least controversial thus hopefully steer clear speculation as to one’s motives. If you take issue with the veracity of what we believe are facts, we are happy to discuss.
With the tone of this piece thus having established, let’s start with a brief recap of the events that eventually led to this:
In December last year, amid the heat and noise of the blocksize debate, representatives from both the Bitcoin Core developer community and the industry at large, including some executives of BTC companies and some large miners (the majority of whom, by coincidence, are geographically based in China) met in Hong Kong at the Scaling Bitcoin Workshop and subsequently, the first Bitcoin Roundtable conference. At the second of the two events, on Feb 21 this year, an agreement was reached and signed by the attendees including both Core developers and industry insiders — this document, published online, came to be known as the Hong Kong Consensus.
The reaching of such an agreement is a significant event and is widely perceived a positive development, especially given a new round of skepticism and criticism set off by the rage quit of former Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn. Now with the Consensus signed, criticisms, such as Bitcoin has a fundamental and irremediable governance issue and that the Bitcoin community is at a civil war with itself with two camps dueling each other to death, were put at bay, at least temporarily. One may even argue that it serves to rekindle hope by showing Bitcoiners that in a time of crisis, the community are willing to discard their differences, and make compromises when greater good is at stake.
In this Consensus document, one part stands out:
*We will continue to work with the entire Bitcoin protocol development community to develop, in public, a safe hard-fork based on the improvements in SegWit. The Bitcoin Core contributors present at the Bitcoin Roundtable will have an implementation of such a hard-fork available as a recommendation to Bitcoin Core within three months after the release of SegWit.*
*This hard-fork is expected to include features which are currently being discussed within technical communities, including an increase in the non-witness data to be around 2 MB, with the total size no more than 4 MB, and will only be adopted with broad support across the entire Bitcoin community.*
Many perceive this as the outcome of the political arm wrestling between the Chinese miners and Core developers. The developers, in order to secure the support of the vast majority of hash power, strategiclly promised the miners 2mb hard fork. The miners, leveraging their hardware assets, had a chance to express their demand face to face to the developers and even had the later make a promise in written form.
There is no doubt that the 2mb hard fork is important in this document, actually if people were not serious about it, they wouldn’t have taken the trouble to assign a deadline to it:
*The code for the hard-fork will therefore be available by July 2016.*
Now with June approaching its end and June a few days away, there has been increasing concern whether the Core devs are ready to deliver on their promise, or any effort have been made during the past months towards this end. Some may feel compelled to ask: Were the Core devs who signed the document sincere in their promise or just squeezing the situation for all it’s worth?
Whatever the answer is, the Chinese community present at the Roundtable and signed on the Consensus saw the 2MB hard fork as a key negotiating point and something important to their interest. Today, this stance hasn’t changed.
Arguments were sometimes made that the Chinese didn’t hold up their end of the bargain — for instance, some mining pools gave users the option to mine Classic blocks — which was seen as a breach by some; however, this doesn’t negate the fact that people like HaoBTC made a strenous effort in fending off criticism from Chinese Classic supporters and Blockstream conspiracy theorists.
Diminishing the importance of mining in the Bitcoin economy, or calling the Chinese miners as whole corrupt and detrimental to decentralization is not a valid argument for its obvious falsity, not to say that it is not helping solve the issue — some of the Chinese attendees, such as HaoBTC, are heavily involved in mining, but are also run other services such as exchanges and wallets. Today, few would doubt that the Chinese bitcoiners account for a significant chunk of the economy and a legitimate constitution of the Bitcoin political system.
While we are under no illusion that the Consensus is a binding, enforceable legally enforceable document, we see it at least an authentic expression of the intensions of parties involved — If things have moved on to a point that some signatories now feel they have to reconsider or rescind their positions, it would be fair that they make public anouncement to such effect so the rest are aware of such developments and take actions accordingly. It would be disingenuous and unfair to keep others in the dark. As a signatory of the agreement, we (HaoBTC ) are interested in hearing any comments from the Core devs, especially those that signed on the document, regarding the current status of affairs.
Thanks and Best regards,
The HaoBTC Team

I'd like to hear the reasoning behind this assumption.
If a strong supermajority of miners goes to a 2 MB fork, anyone staying on the original fork runs into several problems. The first being long confirmation times, making using the original fork impractical, the second being the risk that the miners might, weeks later, direct a small fraction of their mining power to roll back all transactions on the original fork and ram it further into the ground.
It does depend strongly on merchants and exchanges, but I suspect that they will follow the lead of the miners for the reasons described above.

Hetzner (a German low-cost server provider/hoster) is selling *additional* traffic (after you used up your 10 TB monthy allowance) for [something like $2/TB]( (and they recently lowered it a bit). That's astonishingly cheap but they wouldn't be doing it if they weren't making profit off it, so I'd consider that a lower bound if you're good at getting cheap traffic. Amazon EC2, Google Cloud and Azure are, if I remember correctly, [something around]( $80-120/TB (unless you want to talk to Asia or Australia, then you're fucked). I think they're pretty expensive, so I consider that the upper-reasonable-bound. (These are all figures for egress. Internal and inbound traffic is free with all of these providers iirc.)
Given these bounds, I think $20 is reasonable.
Where the hell do you pay $1 per GB? That's really bad. Like almost mobile Internet in Germany bad. I'm not kidding. With the cashback trick (buying an expensive contract that comes with money instead of a new phone) you can sometimes get 5 GB/month of unthrottled *mobile* traffic for ~5 EUR if you're lucky. See [here]( (search for DataGo M) -- 3 GB/month for an effective cost of 4,37 EUR (i.e. ~$5/month).
And finally, if you get a [really cheap box with unlimited traffic]( the effective price can be below $0.20/TB. At that point, it's probably not profitable for the hoster/ISP though.

If you have to ask this question, you're going to burn your house down. Not kidding. You add/multiply. Twenty times 1300 W means 26000 W.
You're talking about deploying 26 kW of hardware. At 230 V, that's more than 100 amps. At 110 V,  more than 230.
Before you buy the miners, do a cheap experiment. Buy 20 1300 W space heaters (or 10 2600 W) and run them where you plan to run the miners. If your breakers flip, they'd also flip if you connected the miners. If your home becomes hotter than the surface of the sun, it'd also do so if you connected the miners.
For a mining operation this size, you need to have an idea of how to get the power in and the heat out. You will also need to figure out how to get the power to the thing that gets the heat out. That's probably going to be another kW if you use fans or another 10 kW if you use air conditioning.
Just plugging a surge protector into the nearest wall outlet won't do the trick. (Unless "the trick" is setting your house on fire, in which case the surge protector is a *great* idea).

Yes, the only known way to do this is to repeatedly generate addresses.
Specifically, the probability that he gets an address starting with "himom" (upper or lower case) after the fixed "1" prefix is:
* 2 out of 58 for the first letter
* 1 out of 58 for the second letter, because uppercase i is not allowed (hard to distinguish I l and 1 in some fonts)
* 2 out of 58 for the third letter
* 1 out of 58 for the fourth letter, because uppercase o is not allowed (hard to distinguish 0 and O in most fonts)
* 2 out of 58 for the fifth letter
So in total, 2 * 1 * 2 * 1 * 2 out of 58^5,  
= 8 in 656356768  
= 1 in 82044596
That means he needs, on average, generate around 41 million keys and derive the public key, then the address, to get this.

The insurance (basically the "FDIC" equivalent for the Americans here) worked as it should, and it was a minor annoyance.

* An address that was never spent from will remain secure *until it is spent from*. This also means that a quantum attacker can wait until you try to spend it, break the key before the transaction confirms, and then try to replace your transaction (e.g. if miners allow full RBF, or he somehow keeps your transaction from reaching the miners, or if he collaborates with or is a miner - see also below).
* An address that was spent from is broken. A quantum attacker can compute the private key and spend the funds.
* Any attacker (including one *without* a quantum computer) who has the *extended* public (!) key and a non-hardened *child* private key[ can compute]( the parent private key and thus other child keys, posing additional risk for hierarchical deterministic wallets. Don't give out your xpub! This is not quantum-specific but quantum attacks make it more likely that the attacker can get child private keys.
* Quantum computers *might* be usable for incredibly fast mining, but I don't know enough to confirm or rule this out. If this is the case, it is likely not fixable without a hard fork changing the proof of work algorithm and obsoleting all existing ASICs. (IIRC the effective strength of hashes, expressed in bits, is halved against a quantum attacker - i.e. a 256 bit hash is as safe against a quantum attacker as a 128 bit hash against a regular attacker. This is likely still good enough for practical purposes, but in Bitcoin, the attacker only has to find a partial collision.)
* Bitcoin uses 160-bit hashes in various places. The effective strenth of a hash is half the hash length due to the birthday attack, giving this only 80 bits of strength which is already way too close for comfort without quantum computes. Quantum attacks halve the strength. If those two effects are cummulative, a powerful quantum computer (i.e. probably not the first model that "only" eats public key crypto for breakfast) might allow various sorts of attacks. I think the birthday attack would not be useful for spending another person's coins, so this probably won't be a problem in practice.
* It is possible to change the signature algorithm in Bitcoin to be quantum safe. Probably even with a softfork. Once deployed, you'd still have to create a new address and move your coins to the new "safe" address in order to benefit from the security. Depending on the design, the new addresses might also be single-use only (i.e. once you spend from them once, any funds sent to them are either lost or can be stolen).

I am aware that miners can implement it individually. Once one miner with a significant hashrate percentage starts, others will likely follow.
However, the miner starting it risks losing more than he wins. Even though the consequences would be collective, they would *also* be individual. This is not even a "prisoners dilemma" scenario where defecting always benefits the defector, ultimately leading to the worst outcome - a single significant miner defecting could be enough to ruin acceptance/the price, hence reducing the value of the miner's significant investment in mining equipment and costing him more than the small benefit in fees (keep in mind that only a small number of transactions would be double-spent). It would also hurt the other miners, but the first miner doing this might lose out *even if the others didn't change their behavior*.
The block subsidy going away will reduce the cost for the miners, but damaging Bitcoin will still hurt the value of the miner's investment (less transactions = less fees).
A miner with limited significance (low hashrate and hence not as much investment at stake) could start doing this with less risk, but the small probability that this miner will mine the attack tx before one of the other miners do so would also limit the risk to the payment provider relying on 0-conf. Likely to the point where the provider could easily accept the risk.

Don't invest more than you are willing to lose. Bitcoin is speculative. If you are uncomfortable with losing half your invested value within a month, you're investing too much. I had some ETH when it was around $400. It was worth $200 for a while after that, although it went up again.
That said, Bitcoin is an excellent learning tool. I've learned more about financial markets thanks to Bitcoin than to all my other education, and while I made some money out of it, it would have been worth it even if I had lost a couple hundred dollars.
You will learn how to stay calm when the price drops. You will learn how financial markets work (pro tip: don't daytrade, don't try to "find the best time to get in", don't arbitrage - at least not with serious money. You can try will a small amount to learn, of course, just realize that if you made money it usually means you were lucky, not smarter than the rest). And since the market is volatile, largely unregulated, and regularly upset by events like forks or exchanges going bust/getting hacked, learning is much faster and associated with much lower fees than in the stock market.

You can have your bank reverse that. I'm surprised such mistakes happen, I thought the system for taking money was separate from the one for sending money. (Edit: looks like no such mistake happened and OP confused transactions.)
And its actually a pretty clever system. The merchant's bank trusts the merchant to a certain extent. So just like extending a line of credit, they let them send requests to take money from other people's accounts up to a certain amount. The request has to include an authorization reference etc. but this is not checked by the bank.
The merchant's bank forwards the request to your bank (the banks trust each other). Your bank takes money from your account, gives it to the merchant's bank, who puts it in the merchant's account.
You realize that you don't like the transaction, e.g. because you never authorized it. You tell your bank. Your bank immediately refunds the money. It is now their problem. They tell the merchant's bank, and get the money back from them (plus some fee). It is now the merchant's bank's problem. The bank either gets the money from the merchant (plus some more fees) or not. If not (e.g. because the merchant is a scammer) it is no different as if the merchant took out a loan and disappeared.
The merchant won't scam because it wouldn't pay off, they'd just get hit with the reversal fees, and because the bank only lets trustworthy merchants do that.
In the end, this means that in order to pay on Amazon, you just give them your bank account number. No PIN, no anything. They check with a credit bureau style entity that you aren't known for making fraudulent chargebacks and that the address matches, and you're set.
Completely insecure and seemingly insane in theory, works great and is extremely convenient in practice. Cheap, too, if I remember correctly.
Thought I'd post this since banks usually get shat on here as if they couldn't get anything right. 
For OP, the best way to fix this is to give them a week or two to fix it. If they don't, you can still reverse the transaction if it was indeed a SEPA withdrawal.

The question is, which of the two chains will they call "Bitcoin", if one of them follows the original algorithm but the other has a significant majority of hashpower? And who has to implement the replay protection? If one party changes the protocol to support replay protection, they're basically saying that they're the fork. That's not going to happen.
In the case of Bitcoin Cash it was pretty simple, because everyone, including the Bitcoin Cash devs, knew from the beginning that it would be a contentious hardfork with Bitcoin Cash as the minority chain, and thus that it would be up to them to implement the replay protection.

Assuming a market that has found (and is holding) the point where one miner is *just* marginally profitable, this would be true. 
But the price varies, which can make an unprofitable miner profitable or the other way around. A marginally profitable miner would have to weigh the small potential gain of attacking bitcoin against the risk of becoming completely unprofitable *and reducing the chance of becoming profitable due to a price rise*.
The pool you mentioned seems to have shut its doors, but IIRC it never had a significant size, i.e. wasn't relevant enough to reduce the willingness of payment providers to accept 0-conf.
Remember, 0-conf doesn't have to be secure. 0-conf only has to be secure enough that the losses from accepting it are smaller than the losses from requiring verification and losing customers. If I had to wait up to an hour or two before I could play my Humble Bundle, or pay an additional $0.50 for the tx, I would not use Bitcoin to pay for it.
Just to demonstrate that the market is far from a theoretical "ideal" market: In an ideal market, the label "Core" on a piece of software would have no influence on the likelihood that miners choose it, yet in reality, it does.

BTC only has the regular adjustment every 2016 blocks. If 95% of miners were to leave, it would take 40 weeks for 2016 blocks to be mined. This would likely kill BTC.
OTOH, if 90% of mining power leave BCC, the emergency adjustment will not trigger if I'm not mistaken, so it will still take 20 weeks *unless miners play tricks like they did during the initial forking*.
The main risk, for both sides of the fork, is value goes down -&gt; profitability goes down -&gt; miners leave for the other side -&gt; trust in the first side goes down -&gt; value goes down further -&gt; cycle repeats

You borrow a Bitcoin and sell it. Then you have to buy it back, no matter the cost, when it's time to return it. If it falls in price, you can buy it back cheap, and make money.
In the real world, what can happen is that you lose EVERYTHING this way: price goes up a lot, and now you have to sell your house to be able to buy it back. But what if you don't have a house? Then you're bankrupt and the lender lost his (now very valuable) coin. Also, it'd be hard for an exchange in China to force you to sell your house in the US.
To prevent this, there is a thing called a margin call: You have other stuff in your account (money, other cryptocurrencies, ...). This is considered collateral. If you owe someone 1 Bitcoin due to a short, and you have $1500 worth of assets, then as Bitcoin approaches $1500, the exchange will sell your other assets, buy a Bitcoin, and return it to the lender. The good news for you is you keep your house, the bad news is you lose everything on the exchange, even if Bitcoin falls back afterwards.
There is also something called leverage. I don't fully understand it but IIRC it's basically betting and follows the same principle, just that changes in price are reflected 10x (for example). That way, even if you only have $1000 to invest, you can double it if Bitcoin rises 10% (at the price of losing it all if Bitcoin falls 10%). Or the other way around in the case of shorts.
There is also a thing called a short squeeze. Someone buys up a lot of coins, driving the prices up, until the exchanges call a lot of others because the collateral isn't enough. Now they're forced to auto buy coins at a high price as the whale sells and laughs. Doesn't work well if you aren't the biggest whale on the market by far, iirc (or doing some super smart trading).
All in all, this sort of trading is a great way to lose everything, even if you actually know what you're doing. Stay away from it.
Also, there was a fun case (outside Bitcoin) where during massive fluctuations (CHFEUR when the artificial coupling was dropped by the Swiss central bank), some bank/exchange couldn't execute "stop loss" trades  fast enough, so the customers lost all they put in *and* were on the hook for shittons of money. Someone was gambling with around $3k and the bank now demands around $300k from him. IIRC exactly the same can happen if an exchange can't sell their customers' collateral fast enough. I'd rather start doing meth than dabble in this sort of trading.

One thing to keep in mind if you're currently saving small amounts of money from limited income: $100 right now probably mean a lot more to you than $100 will mean to you if you get a good job. Learning to save money is important, and definitely don't be wasteful and throw away all your money easily, but don't be afraid to spend some of the money on things you truly enjoy or that help you learn or experience new and interesting things (that may be Bitcoin, but it might also be computer/sports/music equipment, tickets to an event, train tickets to go explore somewhere or participate in something, ...)
Those maybe $300 that I saved up from gifts and allowance as an elementary school kid over years would definitely have been better spent back then. On the other hand, not spending all your money as soon as you get it is a virtue that many adults lack, with catastrophic results for them. Learning to find an healthy balance is an art that I certainly haven't mastered yet either.
(OTOH, if you put it in Bitcoin and it goes 10x again, saving might be worth it. Also, if you need to save up for college, your situation may be different - I'm from Europe and my University education cost something like $300 per semester, including a public transport ticket that by itself was worth more than that).

@_date: 2016-06-10 11:55:15


The risk is limited by the number of miners who have the transaction and don't allow RBF. Thus, as a payment processor, you might want to make sure that 99% of the known hashpower has the tx and is known for not allowing full RBF, and accept the remaining risk, in order to be able to provide an acceptable user experience.
If I buy some digital good for immediate consumption, I sometimes pay with Bitcoin because I don't want to give Paypal money and pulling out a phone, pointing it at my screen, and sending the coins is convenient. Add a wait that might typically be between 0 and 120 minutes to the equation, and I'm going to use Paypal instead, because I want to play that game now, not in a few hours.
Thus, making full RBF *common* instead of a relatively theoretical risk breaks a very common use case of Bitcoin and would likely force payment providers to stop accepting 0-conf payments and as a result, force user and merchants to stop using Bitcoin. Which Lightning will not fix because having to lock money into a channel first is a sufficient inconvenience by itself.

First seen means just that: The first of the conflicting transactions that made it to you through the P2P network.
If the transactions are sent very close to each other or the network is partitioned, different miners will treat different transactions as "first seen", and then the mining consensus algorithm will resolve the conflict.
However, if I try to buy ice cream, broadcast the legit transaction, then 30 seconds later try to double-spend, and the network is working normally, then the legit transaction will have reached all major miners, and most likely I won't be able to convince them to consider the duplicate transaction if they follow this approach (which used to be the default, not sure if it's still the case).
As a result, as long as almost all miners follow this approach, I can consider a double-spend unlikely as soon as a transaction has made it to most mempools without a conflicting transaction being seen. Not good enough for high-value/high risk transactions like exchange deposits, more than good enough for the coffee.

With a 24-word seed, this means 8 words per person. Let's say the attacker is the person who has parts A and B, because that combination is more powerful. That means they have the first 16 but lack the last 8 words. Each word is 11 bits. The actual seed is 256 bits. You'll notice that 24 * 11 = 264 - the last 8 bits are a checksum, can be calculated from the rest, and provide no security.
That still means the attacker would have to guess 80 bits. This should be secure. With a 12-word seed, I'd have to do some more math to be sure, but it would likely be breakable.
I don't fully understand the "PIN" thing: if I read the Ledger documentation correctly, you can have one PIN that protects the key represented by the 24-word seed. This should be the "plausible deniability PIN" you mentioned. If you have the seed, you don't need this PIN to access it.  Then the Ledger supports a second PIN that protects access to a key represented by (seed + passphrase). This PIN is only useful in conjunction with a Ledger storing the passphrase. Alternatively, you can enter the passphrase directly without tying it to a PIN. Either way, if you need to recover from the seed, you need seed + passphrase.
Make sure you know (and possibly store at the solicitor) the actual passphrase, not just a PIN tied to it. Also, the passphrase should be strong (80+ bits of entropy) if it is supposed to protect against an attacker who has the seed.


Ledger Nano S uses a ST31H320. I couldn't find which exact chip the Trezor uses but it's similar, also from STM. I doubt it's any better in terms of security. The Trezor uses the hardware RNG of the chip, and I'd assume the Ledger does the same, but that does not mean that there can't be a bug in the hardware (causing guessable randomness) or in the software (potentially compromising the randomness even if the chip is OK). "Secure" elements are no guarantees, even with certifications: 
However, if you use a strong passphrase, you'd still be fine even if the RNG was bad.
Another risk is somebody hacking Ledger, and backdooring the next firmware update AND their webwallet.

How to make money with crypto:
1. Create a startup that pushes "AML Bitcoin"
2. Find 2-3 politicians who only understand "those Internet things" if someone prints out a ELI5 page for them, and convince them to support your cause by "explaining" the "problems" of the "horrible" current situation and then offering your solution.
3. Drum up interest by getting shitty "news" sites that don't bother with facts (as should be obvious to anyone familiar with Bitcoin when reading the article) report about it.
4. Profit (by getting investors for your altcoin startup/buyers for your shitcoin ICO). Actual delivery of anything not required.

As Bitcoin Cash has shown, only a small fraction of hashrate follows profitability. Per  the main chain has an 24h average inter-block time of 10.35 minutes.
The statement regarding the Core implementation continuing to trade as BTC/XBT was when the alternative was a more-or-less unilateral fork attempt with questionable support, not something that went through on-chain voting, and an agreement supported by some exchanges. That makes it a lot more tricky. A number of the hardfork statement signatories have also later signed the NYA, making it further unlikely that they will follow Core.
The NYA signatories have made clear that they don't consider it a fork, but an "upgrade", so it seems to me like they'd likely treat the Core chain as a fork. The question is what the rest will do.
Is there a list of exchanges that have explicitly, and specifically regarding the Segwit2x fork, stated they will stick with Core? I've only seen that nob2x doc that simply lists everyone who hasn't signed the NYA which is not very helpful.

In the end, miners *could* do either, the incentives are not cut-and-dry (is an extra 0.001 BTC fee once in a while worth devaluing Bitcoin and thus this and all future 12.5 BTC block rewards ever so slightly?), and reality will tell. Merchants always accept some level of risk when taking payments, and often accepting the risk is worth it to get an increased level of convenience (e.g. not asking for 3D Secure on credit cards because too many legit buyers don't have their password/second factor and abandon the purchase, or accepting the risk of getting scammed by a double-spend).
Obviously, the bigger the risk, the less likely it is to be acceptable, and the more likely merchants are to take countermeasures (e.g. waiting for confirmation) and accept the cost of those countermeasures. The more annoying the countermeasures get (e.g. having to wait a non-deterministic time for your purchased digital goods), the more likely users are to switch to alternatives (e.g. PayPal).
0-conf transactions *usually* working well *in practice* is good for Bitcoin, even if there are no guarantees that they will continue to work that well all the time.

Segwit may theoretically provide an improvement but I doubt it will happen quickly.
Miners moving back to BTC will be the key - the slowness was caused by something like 40% of mining power moving to BCC which was temporarily more profitable. If they simply follow the most profitable chain, they'll soon switch back, however some miners choose the chain to mine based on which one they consider "better", and those probably won't switch back. (These ideological miners, along with inertia, are the reason why Bitcoin has any remaining hash rate at all).
Since we don't know how many miners are in which group (short term profit vs. ideological), it's hard to predict what will happen. It could be everyone moving to BTC, or the bleeding could even continue as more ideological miners who simply didn't act yet make their move.
At the same time, this situation creates uncertainty, which means more people want to trade, which means more movements, which means more congestion.

Not luke-jr here and a big block supporter.
Assuming 1 TB costs $20 to store forever, 10k nodes, and 500 Byte transactions. These are conservative assumptions and it is reasonable to use bigger numbers. Each transaction consumes 500 Byte on each full node, forever. There are also other costs like slower lookups, so again, this is only a lower bound.
Using the above numbers, each TX consumes 5 MB across all nodes. 0.000005 TV times $20/TB is 0.01 cent per TX for storage.
I expected it to be way more. However, add to this the traffic cost - each new full node in the future has to download the TX. Traffic prices vary widely, so I'll assume $20/TB again. Assuming a lot of churn (new nodes replacing old nodes) of 10k nodes/year, that's another 0.01 cent per year, "forever" until the traffic prices drop so much that it becomes irrelevant. Assuming 10 years for that 0.1 cent.
Keep in mind that if you assume that Bitcoin becomes successful, you'll have more full nodes. Still, even multiplying the above numbers by 10 and multiplying storage cost by 10 again to account for SSDs and long-term cost barely justifies today's tx prices.
I honestly expected this to be way more because block chain data *is* expensive since every node has to store it. It could be argued that the fees should cover this cost to discourage people from causing it, or that it shouldn't because the fees only go to miners while the cost is paid by node operators.

The next adjustment will likely make it significantly *more* profitable to mine the Cash fork. If this makes miners switch over, that will of course affect the adjustment *after* that, but that's days away unless a majority of hashpower switch over.
In the meantime, a significant increase in hash power could increase the value of the coin, meaning that it may remain more profitable long-term. 
It seems likely at this point that at the very least, the fork is not going away.

Ask yourself whether you'd still have your coins if your house a) gets burglarized and/or b) burns down while you're inside, with you barely managing to jump out of the window naked. If you're worried about your loved ones getting your coins if you die, add c) burns down while you're inside, with you not managing to escape.
If the answer is no, you need to rethink your strategy.
If the answer is yes, then the Trezor breaking (which is always something you should plan for) will not be a problem.
Security wise, you're always trusting the company that makes them and you could be subject to supply chain attacks (someone swapping it with a malicious one before it reaches you).
Since IIRC transactions are not created on the device, but they are validated and signed there, you should be reasonably safe against coin-destroying bugs (and the Trezors are well-tested, widespread harrware).

Because the payment provider where I'm paying, the exchange where I'm buying, etc. will show the price in whatever unit they like, and even if my wallet supports it, setting it to the same everyone else uses is probably the best for my sanity.

Authy allows you to back up your keys and even sync them through their cloud if I'm not mistaken. Google Authenticator is locked down hard; on a non-rooted, current/secure device, nobody is getting those keys out - not even you if you need to transfer them, but also not an attacker who has temporary access to your phone or has infected your PC and tricks you into allowing an `adb backup`.
I'd say GA is more secure against attacks due to this, but you're more likely to lose the key, Authy is more convenient but does allow you to shoot yourself in the foot (leak the secret) more easily. Both are best used while understanding their properties. And know how you will recover if your phone breaks.

No. There is huge power in defaults. If one wallet defaults to mBTC, another to BTC, another to Bits, etc. it will be hugely confusing.
While giving users choice is a noble goal, it's of limited usefulness when you visit a payment provider that you haven't used before and suddenly see the price in different units. A shitty but consistent default is often better than three different units used all over the place, which is why were stuck with 0.00031 BTC ($1) Steam games and paying fees of 0.000067 BTC for the transaction instead of 0.31 / 0.067 mBTC  or 310 / 67 bits.
What is needed is widespread agreement for one default at least for consumer-grade use, definitely one that avoids a large number of decimals (confused everyone) and preferably one that avoids a large number of zeros (confuses people from Western countries where 1 currency unit is roughly 1 piece of cheap grocery) for typical purchases, then everyone defaulting to that.
Offering customization is nice, but unfucking the default is more important.
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:30:09
You're absolutely correct.
There's also one thing to consider: The BCC emergency difficulty adjustment, which can drop the difficulty within something like 12 or 18 blocks.
On one hand, this allows it to adjust much quicker than BTC if an absolutely huge amount of hashpower rapidly fluctuates from one chain to the other. On the other hand, if a strong supermajority of miners collaborate, they could trick the adjustment algorithm much easier to reduce difficulty (e.g. by switching to mining BTC for 12 hours right after the BCC difficulty rises, then switching back and seeing the difficulty drop massively).
Under normal circumstances, assuming miners don't spoof timestamps/intentionally stop mining/..., the emergency adjustment would only trigger if over 90% of current hashpower dropped though, so it's quite possible that it will never happen again, and won't be a significant factor in the fight for supremacy between the two coins.

This sounds like a textbook example of what you shouldn't do.
Unless you already know that you'll be easily able to pay those loans off if everything goes south, selling now, paying the loans off and taking your winnings home might be a good idea.
Especially if you father doesn't like Bitcoin, he'll probably not be to happy about the loan (does he know? If not, he'll probably kill you if he hears about that...)
The more ferociously you try to convince people, the less likely you are to appear rational, and noone wants to listen to what they perceive as crazy zealots. So keep that in mind when trying to argue for Bitcoin. Using a third-party talk is certainly a good idea.
I think explaining the technology makes sense. It's relatively simple once you treat all the crypto as a black box and start by explaining the idea of a global public ledger.

A PRNG bug is not likely, but would have catastrophic consequences.
There was a well-publicized issue like this with some smart cards used by some "electronic ID card" scheme in Taiwan, so this is not just an arbitrarily made up risk: 
PRNG bugs in *software* wallets have happened too, if I remember correctly.
While so far none are known in hardware wallets, and there is a good chance that they're secure, it may, for example, be a good idea to generate 128 bits of coin-flip randomness, and XOR that into a hardware wallet generated seed.
This still wouldn't protect reused addresses from attacks based on repeated ECDSA signature nonces, though.
The paper backup is a completely separate problem because it can be stolen or destroyed in the same fire that destroys the HW wallet.

1. They don't have to only charge what it costs. They can charge what people pay. Bitcoin advocates are willing to pay a lot for the privilege of transacting with Bitcoin, users who are not literate enough to use an exchange will pay whatever the price is because they don't know better, and people who need their coins now may just pay the premium because they need their coins now.
2. Someone needs to pay for the machine and for setting it up. Since they are made in small numbers, they are expensive.
3. Cash handling costs money. Quite a lot, actually - that "cashback" service many shops offer is not just nice customer service, it's a way to get rid of cash.
4. Risk. If someone steals the machine and/or the cash inside (or smashes the machine trying), that's a significant cost.
5. Small volume/number of transactions. Since those have to cover all the fixed costs, it drives the per-coin cost up.
6. The machine has to have some money on an exchange and/or some coins in a wallet, binding capital and exposing it to risk (counterparty risk, exchange rate risk, ...)

70k is probably cheaper than restoring the systems and the outage until that happens.
Restoring the systems and taking the outage is probably cheaper than 70k today and all the ransoms they'll pay in the future because they become known as an easy target that will pay up. If they were still running Win2k there's no way for them to get their security to a decent level within months. 
Also, if you got hacked and just pay the ransom and don't do any cleanup afterwards, you're dumb.

It's also unclear whether this is an estimate or just the sum of reported cases, and whether it is worldwide or US only.
Assuming it's the worldwide number criminals managed to extort, that would be over $2M per day, and as such, ransomware alone could account for 100% of the LocalBitcoins volume if all ransoms were paid via Bitcoin bought there. While that won't be the case, it indicates that ransomware could indeed be responsible for a large fraction of LocalBitcoins volume.

Each time miners find a valid block, the miner gets a pre-defined number of Bitcoins. The blocks are numbered, your block is only valid if it has a number 1 larger than the previous block (and says what exactly the previous block is). For each block, the number of Bitcoins it will grant has been programmed into the software from the beginning. The first blocks gave 50 each, then after a certain number of blocks, the next ones gave 25 each, etc., and at some point, they will give 0. Add up all the numbers and you reach 21 million. Once all the blocks that give a reward have been mined, no new bitcoins will be created.
A bitcoin is basically just a number in a global database (which is formed by the blocks). You own them by having the database attribute the coin to your key, and you can use the key to add an entry to the database that says that from now on, the coin should be attributed to someone else.

* Combinations of the above, e.g. firemen drag you out of the apartment in your underwear, barely alive and with amnesia caused by the smoke inhalation

Authenticator data is not backed up to the cloud. All the authenticator app does is take a key (which you typed/scanned) and the current time (or counter), and locally calculates the number. The only reason why it would communicate with the Internet is to sync time, and that [feature]( apparently needs to be triggered manually (and will not leak any info about what keys you have, and since it's manual, it also won't allow correlation between the times when you sync and the times when you log in to the exchange unless you use it often just before logging in). It also doesn't show up in my list of apps that used data this month.
Of course, if someone were to get access to your device, and had either your password or the key or collaborated with the exchange, they could prove that the key on your device matches the key stored at the exchange.

You're right, maybe we shouldn't scale to 2 **G**B blocks right now.

Running a node currently costs 5 EUR/month, with plenty of reserves to spare.  
Running a node with 2 MB blocks still costs 5 EUR/month.  
Running a node with 4 MB blocks still costs 5 EUR/month.   
Running a node with 8 MB blocks most likely still costs 5 EUR/month.
Running a 8 MB node at home that *contributes* to the network requires maybe 16 Mbyte/10min = 128 Mbit/10min = **213 kbps** of upstream bandwidth. Probably less with all the optimizations that were made recently.

So a heist could have the seed fall into the wrong hands, and a natural disaster could potentially destroy seed and Trezor. More copies of the seed means less fire risk and more theft risk.
If the seed was generated on the Trezor, you're also not protected against a potential RNG vulnerability.
Granted, those are not particularly big risks, but I think the counterparty risks with GBTC aren't that huge either, and [heists robbing safety deposit boxes]( happen as well as [ and possibly large fires.
It is also neither cheap nor easy for people who don't already have a safe deposit box anyways, and not very convenient.

Assuming the bottleneck is crypto validation, certainly. More optimization is unnecessary for the current state and minor scaling. This would be relevant in cases of massive scaling (significantly more than 10x).
In case the true bottleneck turns out to be IOPS when scaled up, I would expect that the database layer could be improved (for example to support storing some data in RAM, some on SSD, some on spinning disk). Also, cluster support (to let people run their nodes on *two* Raspberry Pis if we scale slowly, or to let people run their nodes on a rack of servers if we completely drop the block chain limit and a magic elf suddenly makes everyone in the world use Bitcoin for *everything*, completely replacing all other payment systems).
Initial blockchain download would indeed be infeasible from a residential low-speed connection - you'd have to have it shipped or check it out from a library or something.
An alternative would be to rent a well-connected server, download and verify the blocks there, and only transfer the resulting UTXO set. That, in my opinion, is still a very reasonable option for people who insist on running a production instance of a global payment network from home.
All this assumes that you insist on verifying the blocks yourself, instead of just taking someone else's UTXO set and trusting them. Since at some point (e.g. initial software download, getting your OS, buying your hardware) you're trusting someone anyways, this is a realistic *and* reasonable option, even though it may appear a bit unpalatable.

1. No *implementation* of Bitcoin is more official than the other; Bitcoin Core is no more special than Classic etc.
2. This is good. Having multiple different development teams is good. (Point 1 states a fact, point 2 judges the fact).
3. Specifically, having more developers and developer teams will generate more different solutions. (Explains why it is good/what *specific* effects are expected)
4. No single group of developers has the right to make decisions in the name of the entire community. (Point 1 is about implementations, point 4 is about development teams. This is obviously overlapping but could be relevant if e.g. one version *by accident* considers certain signatures invalid while another does not, without intent from the developers.)

They're different exchanges. You will see the same with stocks, there are multiple exchanges and there can be surprisingly large price differences between them.


No, the price is the last price at which a trade happened *on that exchange*. For exchanges that operate like a stock market (most of them) that's not a price for which you can buy/sell immediately. For that, you'd have to look at the order book to see for what price people are currently offering to sell/buy coins to/from you. The price at which people are willing to sell is always higher than the price at which others on that exchange are willing to buy (otherwise, the trade would happen and the offers disappear from the order book because they're fulfilled). The difference between these prices (called "ask" and "bid") is called the "spread". The more people are trading, the lower the spread typically is.
If the price for which you can buy Bitcoin at exchange 1 is lower than the price for which you can sell Bitcoin at exchange 2 (including fees), you can make money. This is called *arbitrage* and a lot of people who know how the market works are doing it (with bots).
The problem is that for it to work in a risk free way, you'd need to be able to buy and sell at the same time. That means you need to have cash at exchange 1 and coins at exchange 2, and moving coins/money between exchanges costs time and/or money. So making money this way is not "free".
People who do arbitrage provide a valuable service by equalizing the prices across exchange, and the money they make from the differences is how they get paid. The remaining price differences are basically showing the market determined price for moving money between exchanges. A high difference typically means that people at one exchange are selling more while people on another exchange are buying more, and moving money and coins between those exchanges is a pain.
Unless you're good at both coding and economics and have experience in finance, I think it's unlikely you can profit from arbitrage today, and making a mistake can be expensive. 
Bitcoin is great for learning about finance :)

Right, they could sell more shares than they claim to have sold, then pay out each share the promised amount - the first lot of shares from the mining loot, the rest from the Ponzi.
However, the number (and owners) of shares sold are public if all shares are bought by sending BTC to one publicly known address, and payments can be verified - for each block they claim to have mined each of the addresses has to receive the payment, which is verifiable again.

What is your upload bandwidth? Even if the inflated numbers from your calculator were correct (I think they're bloated by a factor of 7, currently), it claims 3 Mbit/s upload for 8 MB blocks. Is your Internet really that shitty even in cities? That sounds horrible :(
Why I think the numbers are wrong: The tool you linked claims that a higher upload bandwidth than download bandwidth is needed. I would like an explanation for that claim. Where is the additional data going if the total download bandwidth of the nodes is smaller than the upload bandwidth of the nodes? 
The only explanation I'd have is feeding thin clients. The calculator doesn't take those into account, and instead multiplies by a mysterious "hop count" that just doesn't make sense. Also, if you don't have the bandwidth to feed thin clients, don't do that (as much) from a residential connection, then. You can still participate *and* support the network (you'll just support it less than others, but it will still be net-positive). One of the nodes connected with Gigabit (either a home fiber connection in more densely populated places, or a datacenter) will pick up the slack.
Specifically, from ONE good (gbit fiber) home Internet connection, I could serve 8 MB blocks plus 8 MB worth of transactions to ~6 other nodes *every second*. Or, in other words, I could supply 3750 nodes, aka *more than half of all currently existing full nodes*, with this data during the average block interval. Don't be lazy, do the math yourself. 8 MB blocks plus 8 MB transactions makes 16 MByte. 600 seconds (10 minutes) at 100 MByte/s (a bit less than 1 Gbit/s to account for overhead) makes 60000 MByte. 60000 divided by 16 is 3750. From **one** home Internet connection with **8 MB** blocks.
If your Internet connection is *really* shitty, you always have the option of running your node in some datacenter (that is what my price is based on - including the (VPS) server rental -, and that's the actual price I'm paying for the node that I'm running).
Also, the best part: Segwit does NOT reduce overall traffic if you run a full node and validate witness data. It's not part of the block but you still have to transfer it.

Segwit includes other improvements. Some (including many of the experts who support raising the actual block size!) argue that these are worth doing on their own, others argue that they're introducing too much complexity and are thus too risky.
As a side effect, it introduces an accounting trick that raises the effective block size (by not counting part of the data against it).
This is a one-time improvement. The accounting trick can raise the effective block size once. We will have to hard fork (increase the actual block size) later anyways to allow more on chain scaling.
Many off-chain scaling solutions (like lightning network) need the other improvements from Segwit to work. The supporters of on chain scaling/bigger blocks fear that once segwit is deployed, companies like Blockstream that build such solutions will use their influence on Bitcoin Core to prevent further block size increases, choking the actual Bitcoin network to force people onto their products. This is seen as bad by supporters of on chain scaling because these solutions are partially centralized, introduce massive amounts of complexity, and are seen as a privatization of Bitcoin.
Bitcoin Core has so far shown unwillingness to work on an actual block size increase despite promises to the contrary. Hence, many supporters of an actual block size increase are treating this as an "either-or" situation even though the two solutions are not mutually exclusive technically. This debate would likely become much more rational if Core released code to perform an actual block size increase.
Thus, big block supporters fear that once segwit is introduced without first or simultaneously increasing the block size, Bitcoin as such is going to die or become a settlement network for large banks/companies. Hence, many vigorously oppose it.
The political divide is increased by the fact that the mention of alternative clients that support a block size increase will get you banned in this subreddit (I'm avoiding certain words here because I don't want the bot to eat my post). Disallowing debate and silencing minority opinions rarely leads to good things, and it radicalized many big block supporters, increasing the "us vs them" mentality.
Another issue is that for the majority of people following the debate, Segwit was presented very suddenly, after a lot of research has already been put into simply increasing the block size. It was also "marketed" as a way to increase capacity. At least I felt extremely surprised by it, in a negative way, and the way it was sold as a capacity increase felt like that was being used to avoid a debate on whether the other improvements it brings are worth the added complexity.
There were various agreements (the "Hong Kong roundtable consensus" being the most important one), accusations of back room deals etc. that fanned the fire, but I believe those are the main points.
I believe that miners agree that a cautious on chain capacity increase (in some form) is needed and that segwit alone won't be enough in the long run. Especially Chinese miners seem to strongly follow Core because Core is perceived as an authority, but they are unhappy about the lack of an actual block size increase and at least some likely share the fears described above that activating segwit will let Core block on chain scaling indefinitely.
TLDR: there are both technical (complexity) and political arguments against segwit, and the debate has devolved into a toxic fight even worse than Trump vs. Clinton.

Did anyone figure out what would be the true bottlenecks a) currently b) with optimzied software? I suspect that at least with spinning disks instead of SSDs it would be I/O (IOPS) before we hit bandwidth and CPU limits.
Note that a 5 Mbit/s connection is still roughly 300 MByte per block interval, and even assuming 10k nodes on such shitty connections, 50 nodes on Gbit would be able to provide enough upload bandwidth for the entire network, so the lack of upstream bandwidth wouldn't be a problem.

Again, I believe that 1.5 Mbit/s would be more than enough to participate in the Bitcoin P2P network and *contribute* to it, with 8 MB blocks - the math is above. Even in the worst case, you could still run a node that uses the network but drains more resources than it provides, because there are plenty of nodes that have enough resources to provide for you and others. That way, you wouldn't need any upstream bandwith except for control messages and your own outgoing tx. And that's for running a *full* Bitcoin node with 4x the block size that big-blockers want to switch to currently, directly from a place with really bad Internet (instead of running the node on some cheap server on the other end of your slow connection, as I suggested).
I think I figured out part of the problem with the calculator you linked: It assumes that you're uploading all new blocks to all your peers, concurrently. In reality, many peers would get it from other sources - you would offer the block, and they'd say 'thanks, I already have that one'. This is in addition to multiplying with a factor for "hops" which makes absolutely no sense since you're not relaying traffic for other nodes like e.g. Tor. The calculator also leaves transaction volume out, which makes it underestimate the bandwith a little (but since it also overestimates a lot due to the "hops" nonsense, the total is still too high). You could decide that you only care about blocks and not about unconfirmed transactions to save bandwidth vs. my estimates.

Additional factors:
* SegWit deployment *and adoption* does add some amount of extra capacity (it just can't repeat that trick again). The question is, what will happen when the network hits the January rate times whatever the capacity multiplier provided by SegWit is?
* (This is somewhat part of wallet fee estimation) I suspect there is some inertia or self-reinforcing effect of fees - once demand exceeds capacity, fees start slowly rising, and continue rising for a while even if demand stops increasing, and won't drop unless demand drops under capacity.


They may not be a *direct* threat to the network, but they certainly contributed to a major setback in adoption. And in fast-moving markets (anything online, basically), you need a lot of luck and good timing to be successful - and sometimes, you don't get second chances.
We don't know the actual impact, but at best the fee spike massively hurt and delayed widespread Bitcoin adoption. At worst, it caused it to lose momentum, fizzle out, and start a decline that causes cryptocurrencies to become as irrelevant as many of the other earlier (centralized) attempts at creating alternative currencies.
What we *do* know is that even with improved fee estimations, exchanges batching, SegWit deployed, etc. there is a capacity limit. What's the plan for when we hit it? Lightning? Is there a sign that adoption (merchants *and* users) will be high enough before the limit is hit? Or will fees simply go through the roof again until everyone gives up on using Bitcoin, hoping for another miraculous recovery when Lightning or whatever other solution there will be is actually available *in the wild*?

20th percentile for raising it is OK, but for lowering, we either need to use the 80th percentile or simply disallow lowering.
(Disallowing lowering could be dangerous if miners overshoot and vote for huge blocks, and only later realize the blocks are *too* big. However, allowing lowering also enables miners to create a blockchain-enforced cartel to drive transaction prices up via block space scarcity, without having to resort to more clearly malicious activities like a 51% attack/softfork - rejecting all blocks that don't meet their arbitrary criteria on block size or min tx price).

If we limit the investment to the hardware, it really should be as simple as that - throwing out the old hardware and buying new is basically the same thing as starting from scratch.
This ignores overhead costs (getting a suitable location with suitable power, finding staff, ...), so an established miner does have a small advantage over a new miner, and thus there is *some* remaining value even if new hardware is needed, but I'm not sure if this is enough to counter the argument that short-term thinking is a viable strategy for miners.

No, that's the problem - their votes live on in the form of delegations.
Let's look at an example. 100 people, two noteworthy representatives, A and B. A fucks up horribly. 80 people vote for B, only 20 loyal supporters continue supporting A.
B fucks up horribly. One quarter of his followers stays with him no matter what, one quarter now votes for A, and the remaining half is so pissed off by being betrayed yet again that they decide voting doesn't matter and drop out.
You now have:
 - 20 people who will vote for B no matter what.
 - 40 people who formerly supported B but now stopped giving a fuck
 - 20 people who supported B, now support A
 - 20 people who supported A and still do.
In a representative democracy, A now clearly wins 67% of the vote. In a liquid democracy, B will rule forever thanks to the 20 loyal supporters, and the 40 remaining delegated votes, giving him 60% of the total voting power.
That's only the beginning: People realize that their vote literally doesn't matter anymore, and start dropping out, potentially magnifying the problem.
I did omit people who vote directly, but the same effect is still there if you add them. These are also the first who notice that their votes (on which they spend a lot of effort) don't count, and give up, while the people who just delegated remain (even if you require confirmation to keep delegations from expiring, that's no effort compared to making informed decisions yourself).
You can reduce the problems by slapping band-aids on them, but they'll always be there.


That's the promise but sadly not what you get in the end. I thought the same when I heard about it, but practice has shown me the centralization in which it results. It's worse than a representative democracy with proportional representation, IMHO, and might be even worse than the two party system.
(Your vote in the 2 party system doesn't matter much because the parties are very similar, but that's by design - in a perfectly informed society, the parties would have virtually identical positions at the point where changing them would get more current supporters to disagree than new supporters to agree, in other words, the best politics you get.)
The best democracy you can get, IMHO, is the Swiss system. Proportional representation, plus the possibility of running a referendum on individual issues if the majority disagrees with what the process produces.

The address is the *hash* of the public key. The actual public key (which you'd need to break the key using a quantum computer) only hits the Bitcoin network once the first transaction sending from the address is attempted (and hits the blockchain as soon as the first transaction sending from the address is confirmed).
There are addresses whose keys are public and that still hold coins (due to address reuse), but for an address that only received and never sent coins, the public key isn't publicly known and thus cannot be attacked even by someone who has a quantum computer.

Every software communicating with the network can have bugs that allow remote code execution. The Bitcoin codebase is pretty mature and well-written, making this less likely, but it is not written in a memory-safe language (which would rule out several of the most frequent sources of such bugs).
Tor/VPN won't protect you against those. If such an attack succeeds, the attacker will have full control over the Raspberry Pi. If you properly isolate it, this may be a non-issue even in the unlikely case that it happens.
Participating in the Bitcoin network could also attract DoS attacks. A VPN/Tor would likely but not certainly protect you against those.
Overall, I think the risk is very limited, if you want to be careful don't run anything else on that Raspberry Pi, and don't let it access your network or the admin interfaces of your router (e.g. by putting it onto something like a "guest network" which even consumer-grade routers often offer).

Why is this a guarantee? Confirmations will take 4 times as long, but I'm not sure if that makes enough of a difference. Miners will earn the same amount of Bitcoin per Hash, since the difficulty doesn't change.
As long as people are still willing to buy "Bitcoin Classic" and exchanges support it, I think the old chain would be viable. I'd say it would need at least 95% to make reasonably sure it gets killed off, and even then it wouldn't be a guarantee. Also, there is a risk of XT miners switching back, and while the XT chain can't orphan the Classic chain, the Classic chain can orphan the XT chain to my knowledge.

@_date: 2015-08-28 00:56:35
Could you please clarify the following points in a future version of BIP100, and possibly in a text post on this subreddit until then?
 - The vote evaluation approach.
 - The duration of a "step" (I assume it's 12k blocks like the initial upgrade, but it's not explicitly stated)
 - The 2x scaling limit ("2x" doesn't really make sense for reducing block size).
I think the most sensible way would be
  - If the value at the 20th percentile of the votes is larger than the current limit, the limit is raised to that value (or 2x the current limit, whichever is lower).
  - If the value at the 80th percentile of the votes is lower than the current limit, the limit is lowered to that value (or 0.5x the current limit, whichever is higher).
  - Otherwise, the current limit stays unchanged.
The idea of a 21% attack, which I brought up two days ago, stems from the assumption that the 20th percentile is chosen after each voting period. This would allow a minority of 21% of the miners to drop (but not raise) the block size. By specifying it as above (which I think matches your intention), this is no longer a concern.
Another option would be removing the the option to lower the limit altogether. If the network can support size X at one time, it probably can also do so at any later time. Having an officially sanctioned voting mechanism allows miners to create a cartel and artificially raise tx prices once Bitcoin is popular enough to be unavoidable for some transactions, without having to do an obvious act of bad faith and running a 51% attack that rejects blocks mined outside the cartel.
@_date: 2015-08-31 22:17:37
Unless you have a quantum CPU. (It doesn't break hashing completely, but does weaken it, and I'd be surprised if you couldn't turn it into an incredible mining algorithm).
@_date: 2015-08-28 00:11:58
Depends how the (currently underspecified) BIP100 is implemented. If it is implemented as the 20th percentile (i.e. the minimum after the top and bottom 20% are removed), which seems to be the most common interpretation, 21% of mining power could *reduce* block size, and would require a 51% attack (deviating from the protocol and orphaning their blocks) to stop them.
If it is implemented as the 20th percentile for raising the size, and the 80th percentile for lowering it, then I think it's a pretty good solution. (Yes, miners could collude to push block size down to drive fees up, but 51% of the mining power can already do that by treating any tx with insufficient fees/any too large block as invalid).
@_date: 2017-11-08 07:56:33
If you don't throw away your crypto keys and don't send your coins around, the forked coins will be held under the same key, and you can split them later at your leisure.

@_date: 2015-08-28 22:51:24
With a 20th percentile approach, 21% of miners would be enough to limit block size, while the orphaning approach would require 51%.

Valid point. I guess you could have it on WiFi (you definitely don't want 3G) with as many services turned off as you can if you want to use it as a regular wallet. Just don't run anything else on it, especially not a browser. Ideally don't even add a Google account.
You feed it the destination addresses etc. via QR codes just like you would with an online phone if you start the payment on your PC. If you wanted to keep it truly offline, you could encode the tx as a QR code and display it, then broadcast from the online phone. Not sure if any wallet supports that though. Edit: On second thought, for HD wallets, you'd also need to tell the phone which inputs to use since the phone wouldn't be able to know the balances and utxos of the individual addresses. That'd be one hell of a QR code.

Without having read the specification, I doubt the key actually stores the sites the user visited. That wouldn't scale. What would make sense is having a master key, and then deriving a per-site key, e.g. through something like `HMAC(domain,masterkey)`, and then authenticating using that key.

Why would a *buyer* want to use Bitcoin, other than to support Bitcoin? (Note that he's talking about the buyer).
With Bitcoin, you have zero customer protection, are paying for the exchange fees when you buy the BTC, and if you want to re-buy what you spent, it's a lot of extra work. With Paypal, I click the Paypal icon, I confirm the login (password is saved), confirm the purchase.
Few merchants offer discounts for using BTC (which they should, since the benefits of BTC -non-reversible, low fees- are mostly on the merchant side). This is kind of understandable, though, since Bitcoin integration likely costs quite some money, and they need to make that back on the low volume of Bitcoin users. Also, many Bitcoin users use Bitcoin as a matter of princible, so there's no incentive to offer discounts.
The only situation where this makes sense for the buyer is foreign currency transactions, where paypal keeps a 2.5% fee payable by the buyer. For micropayments, this can be less than the BTC tx fee.

I agree that 2X is likely to fail, especially given  but wanted to correct one thing:


I believe that this is a classic example of a "Byzantine Generals"/self-fulfilling-prophecy situation: If a strong supermajority of miners decides to commit to B2X and put actual hashpower behind it, then B2X will be worth more than the Core chain before 100 blocks are over and the coins are spendable (and thus mining it won't cost the miners anything, quite the contrary).
With the consensus among miners visibly crumbling, I doubt the necessary supermajority will happen, unless there are some backroom deals.

The intro of that reads very much like "we really don't want to raise the limit, so let's make a solution doesn't really do it but can be pushed through as a 'minimal consensus' to kill solutions that do change it".
The rationale reads like "let's wait 1.5 years, and then only deploy it if there is widespread consensus". I'd also like a source for the 17.7%. That would mean a rise in Internet speeds between 2005 and now of only a factor of 5.1.
The peak traffic of DE-CIX was 49 Gbit/s in October 2005, and 4000 Gbit/s in April 2015. Maybe I'm bad at math, but that's more than 5. The average rose by a factor of 4 from 2009 to 2013. [Sources here](
Per  [this page]( peak data rates for DSL in Germany were 6 Mbps in 2005. 50 Mbps has been available for years, and 100 is now being offered. Not even considering all the cable providers who offer even higher rates.
Even more extreme in the US: Comcast [was offering to raise rates to 6 Mbps in 2005]( in response to Time Warner offering [8 Mbps]( Today, Comcast offers up to 150 Mbps. Comcast being shitty, I suspect you'll still be able to pull more than 5.1 * 6 Mbps out of it. And that totally ignores fiber, which will likely be widely available in 10 years, and will likely do more than a 5x increase again.
@_date: 2015-08-24 05:24:59
Possible ways to limit the impact would be:
- requiring delegations to be re-confirmed on a very regular basis
- limiting the amount of delegations a single person can have
- reducing the power of delegated votes either by a constant factor or depending on the number of delegated votes
It's all band-aid fixes though. A core problem is that delegation takes one click/one click per month, voting on the issues individually takes much more effort even if you just vote by looking at the title, and it takes even more effort if you actually want to make an informed decision. And a hundred people who do this can be easily outvoted by one guy who got 100 people who don't give a fuck to delegate to him. This strongly discourages direct participation.
On top of that, in the case of Bitcoin, you get the problem of deciding who gets to vote, how to do it securely, and how to keep Sybil attacks out. Sure, you could do proof of stake, but do you really want a system where the 1% get to decide everyone's fate?
Edit: if you're interested in what happened in the German pirate party, try looking for Liquid Feedback (lqfb), Liquid Democracy etc. I suspect it'll be very hard to understand if you didn't see it unfold though. When looking at numbers, keep in mind that at the time when this happened, the pirate party had about 10k members IIRC.

In a limited way. If miners are honest (i.e. always mine on the longest chain, but pick transactions as they wish), each miner has an incentive to defect (do what's best for them in the short term) than to cooperate (do what's best for all miners in the long term). In other words, if I'm a small miner, I might as well stuff all my blocks as full as the limit allows, to get much more fees than miners who artificially limit block size. 
51% of the miners could, of course, prevent this by refusing to mine on any blocks than contain transactions cheaper than an arbitrarily set price, or on blocks that are above a certain size (soft fork).

Not as insane as you think. If 1/5th (20%) of the hash power remains, confirmation times will be 5 times as long, and if the remaining miners stay, difficulty will partially adjust in at most 10 weeks. If my research is correct, this adjustment is capped at a factor of 4 either way, i.e. it will almost, but not completely, adjust after this time, and completely adjust about 2.5 weeks later. After that, the fork is just as viable, except that the XT miners could at any time run a 50% attack against it if they worked together.
Now, make it 95%, and the adjustment now takes over 9 months, with confirmation times until then being over 3 hours. That should be enough to kill the fork. Anything below 80%, and the fork has a good chance to survive.

The main problem is that it enables a single miner that holds just 21% of mining power to DoS the network. Assume the network is happily chugging around at 32 MB, with blocks full to the brim and fees around 5 ct per tx. Lots of people use Bitcoin and rely on it. Maybe, there is even a Lightining network operating which relies on timely confirmations to settle in cases of malicious actors.
Now, said 21% miner decides that he isn't making enough money (while other miners are happy with the current situation). However, 21% guy gets the block size halved. Fees skyrocket, existing businesses break, and fraud is enabled on Lightning network.
21% guy decided to exit the business once his mining equipment gets obsolete and his free power contract runs out because that new power line is finally getting finished, so he doesn't give a shit about the long-term perspective of Bitcoin. He continues voting to halve once again. (This shows why allowing lowering based on the 20th percentile is dangerous.)
The likely outcome would be, IMHO, that a few big players decide that enough is enough, Bitcoin can't go to shit due to one asshole, and 51% attack him by orphaning his blocks.

Because having 75% of mining power on the "big block" chain just reduces the mining power of the "small block" chain (and lengthens confirmation times until the difficulty readjusts), but doesn't otherwise affect it.
The best way to make the old blockchain really unattractive would be to set the threshold at far more than 75% (say 95%), and schedule it to happen right after a difficulty adjustment. Blocks would arrive only every 3.3 hours. Six confirmations would take almost a day. Finding the 2016 blocks necessary for a difficulty adjustment would take over nine months, and since the adjustments are constrained, the problem would still not be fixed by then.

1000 KB blocks allow, IIRC, ~ 4000 tx per block (i.e. 10 minutes). That's 24k per hour 576k per day.
Raising that to 4M per day won't solve scalability permanently, obviously. At least not for the endgame scenario of Bitcoin being the only money in the world that many dream of. However, it will allow the current transaction volume to grow tenfold, *safely*, giving us a lot of breathing room to figure out how far we can raise the block size in the long term.
Let's look at a more realistic scenario: Bitcoin replaces Paypal, becoming as popular as Paypal is now. [Paypal has]( 1.12 billion tx per quarter, i.e. ~120 days. That is 9.8 million transactions a day.
I think raising the limit to allow Bitcoin to grow almost half as popular as paypal is today is sufficient for the short term, and a good way to give us breathing room to figure out a long-term solution. By then, we'll have enough bandwidth.
**TL;DR: Yes,** raising the block size will solve the scalability problem in a sufficient way, unless you daydream of the unrealistic goal of Bitcoin replacing all money everywhere within 10 years. An increase to ~20 MB should be sufficient to make Bitcoin powerful enough to process the volume Paypal is processing today. On chain.

You may lose the $20. If that's a problem for you don't do it.
You will spend a lot of time around it.
You will learn a lot.
You may become rich and then poor again very quickly, with all the psychological effects that has.
You might turn the $20 into more money, but not "fuck you" money - the market is too big for massive price increases like that. If that's what you're hoping for, buy a Powerball ticket instead (or just get a few drinks).

I think most people who are for a block size increase would be OK with either solution.
Is BIP 100 still possible as written? It suggests scheduling the fork on testnet to happen within the next 2 weeks, meaning we would at the very least need to have an implementation by then, but ideally, *three blockchain-months before that*. Now, a blockchain month can pass quickly on the testnet if miners pour in, I guess, but still, I can't see consensus, implementation and adoption to happen in time.
Delaying the schedule even more won't sit well with people who are already unhappy with the core devs dragging their feet, and will likely see changes to the date as further stalling. However, if the core devs were willing to firmly commit to BIP 100, I suspect most people here would be OK with that.

State of the art is using a slow hash, and ideally adding something to remember, e.g. your e-mail address (this is called a "salt").
A slow hash can be e.g. hashing it many times, or hashing it in a special way that requires lots of memory (scrypt).
If your passphrase is really, really strong (e. g. 10 words selected truly randomly from a 10000 word dictionary), it doesn't matter.
But if your passphrase is not perfect, with the current scheme, an attacker just has to calculate the SHA256 to try a potential passphrase, derive the address that a brainwallet with that phrase would generate, and steal the coins if he finds a real non-empty one. The attacker can do this very, very often - many thousands of times per second - and can thus try many possible combinations.
With slow hashing, the attacker needs to hash it in a way that could take, say, 1 second. Thus, he can only try one passphrase per second. Thus, even if your passphrase isn't that good, there's a much better chance your attacker will never get around to trying the one you used.
Now, there is still the problem that everyone using that passphrase will have the same brainwallet, i.e. if the attacker is trying whether "opensesame" was used as a brainwallet, he's not betting that *you* were dumb enough to do so, he's betting that *someone* was dumb enough to do so, which is obviously more likely. By adding a salt, this is prevented. You can easily remember your e-mail address, but an attacker has to decide whether to try 'opensesame' as a passphrase for 'jrm2007 or for 'aaaaaargh
If an attacker decides to break *your* brainwallet, and your brainwallet only, salting doesn't help you. However, the attack only pays off because the attacker finds many insecure brainwallets, which no longer works if everyone uses salted wallets.
Hence, slow hashing and salting make for much more secure brainwallets with the same complexity of passphrases (obviously, don't reuse passphrases - if someone knows that a9v8tose420h worked for your regular brainwallet, they might spend the second trying it for your secure one too). It might not save you if your passphrase is really shitty, but if you have a somewhat decent one and are not specifically targetted, combining both will probably do the trick.

If the block size is sufficiently high (which 8 MB would be for the near future), Lightning can provide additional useful services.
If block size is too low (which 1 MB blocks would/will likely become within the next year or two), Lightning can become *necessary*.
It's easy to see why one of these is better for Lightning.
Edit: Read a bit more about Lightning. Their official slides point out that even with Lightning, you'd need 133 MB blocks to make Bitcoin a worldwide payment system used by everyone. Lightning is actually kind of a nice idea, but has the potential to end really badly in centralization. However, I think that it is possible to build a endnode - middleman - endnode structure instead of endnode - middleman - middleman - endnode, where the two end nodes will have to find a shared middle man, or join one. I think the fact that this is possible could actually be pretty effective at avoiding centralization, but I haven't looked enough into it to make a really good opinion.

You don't know whether the equipment will turn a profit before it becomes useless (power consumption &gt; mining revenue), and you can't accurately predict it as it depends on the Bitcoin price, hardware developments, how many other people raise capital to mine, ...
I [did the math]( and the contracts were (obviously) set to generate a profit, and given how optimized mining is, unlikely to be profitable for the buyer, but I don't feel like Genesis was ripping the customers off. They sold a service for a price that looks reasonable for what the service provided. The fact that people wanted to buy a service that doesn't make sense is on them.
(~~And the "doesn't make sense" depends on what you want to do with it - if you want to 51% altcoins to hell, or try to mine non-standard transactions, buying this service is probably a very reasonable alternative to buying mining hardware yourself.~~ Edit: Looks like you can't even point it at a custom pool so yeah, it doesn't generally make much sense, except if you want to spend money to support one of their supported altcoins.)

Old solo-mined coins were mined directly to a pubkey, yes. (Also transactions sending via the old "send to IP address" feature).
You can derive a corresponding address from such a pubkey, so that coins sent to that address would be spendable with the corresponding private key, but those new coins would still be sent to the hash of that pubkey (wouldn't help if course). You can't create an address that would let someone send coins to your pubkey as far as I know. The person *sending* the coins defines the type of the output. A 1-address is translated to a P2PKH (pay to pubkeyHASH) output, and there is simply no address format for P2PK.

People are running Tor nodes just to support the network. A decent TOR node costs 20-30 EUR a month. It's reasonable to assume that people will be willing to spend that on Bitcoin.
30 EUR a month [buys you]( a box with 16 GB of RAM, a decent CPU, 300 Mbps unlimited bandwidth, and 2x1 TB of storage. You don't really need the redundancy, so you can run it as a RAID0/JBOD.
Assuming 32 MB blocks, it will take well over a year for this to fill up. For a one-time fee of 60 EUR, you can add another TB on an external HDD, making for almost 2 years of blockchain storage. And by then, server prices will go down.
This are *today's* prices. Assuming 32 MB blocks, with every block actually being 32 MB, starting now.
Coincidentally, Bitcoin and TOR have pretty opposite requirements: Bitcoin requires a bit of network, little CPU, and tons of disk. TOR requires tons of network, some CPU, and no disk. Thus, you can often add a Bitcoin node on the unused resources of a TOR node.
If the Bitcoin daemon gets priority on the network, such a server can blast out a 32 MB block in a second, and two more copies in the same second to other nodes in the same datacenter.
Bitcoin would be fine with 32 MB blocks if they were introduced now. Mining is already pretty centralized, I don't see why it should get worse. Getting a $40 a month server won't discourage a mining pool.
If you can tolerate some propagation delay, running a full node off a commodity computer on a regular home Internet connection would still be perfectly feasible for 32 MB blocks.
Edit: Or you could dump the chain onto the cloud, doing distribution from there, and just do verification locally. You don't need the full blockchain to verify blocks, especially if you can at any time request "all data needed to verify this" from the server.

The legitimate explanations wouldn't be just that it's effectively a way to take a credit, but it also moves the risk (and some of the potential reward) from the mining company to the buyer. 
Nobody can accurately estimate how future mining profits will develop, since it depends on the Bitcoin price, future developments in mining equipment, availability of equipment, electricity prices/mining bans, ...
Selling mining contracts is a way to run a business not just with limited capital, but with a reasonably predictable profit. That profit might be significantly less than what they could have made by mining themselves, or significantly more.
Whether it was sold in a deceptive way, or the buyers are just salty that they made a bad deal, or they made a deal that was fair back then but the market developed differently than expected, or a little of all three, is hard to tell.
If the mining contracts also allowed you to point the hashpower at a pool of your free choice, there's also another aspect to it: Some people have a good reason to pay a premium for that, e.g. because they want to mine non-standard transactions (e.g. harvesting anyone-can-spend outputs) or attempt to 51% an altcoin. (Edit: Apparently you don't get to choose your own pool, which makes this a lot dumber. Still, offering bad business models isn't illegal, and could make sense e.g. in the hash wars if you wanted to spend money to support your favorite coin).
The contract was for 13.5 TH/s. Let's assume the contract expired now, i.e. was taken 18 months ago. Bitmain's web site from January, according to archive.org... was selling Antminer S9's with 13.5 TH/s at 1323W for $2320, but they were sold out and would be delivered several months in the future even before they sold out.
The maintenance fee is $0.28 per TH/s (per day, I assume), so $3.78 for the contract. The power consumption is 1.323 * 24 = 31.752 kWh/day. That's for the mining equipment, you also need to cool it etc.
[The average PUE for all Google data centers is 1.11]( so let's be generous and say 35.2 kWh/day. So if we equal "maintenance fee" to "electricity cost" (keep in mind, someone is also maintaining the equipment, including all the support stuff like power distribution and cooling, renting the location etc.), you're paying 10.7 cents per kWh for power (on the high end for industrial power, but cheaper than what you'd be able to get as an individual in most places), and paid $7k for:
* an up-to-date Antminer that would have cost $2320 to purchase with a two-month lead time *if it was still available*, so worth significantly more if you got it delivered right then and there
* a warranty on said Antminer (if it broke outside of Bitmain's warranty, Genesis had to deal with it)
* a hosted service including maintenance, physical space, infrastructure etc.
for the *useful* lifetime of the miner.
As long as the prices and the "contract ends once the miner is no longer profitable" clause were known to OP up front, OP made a bad deal by trying to get into mining even though it was unprofitable, but based on the above numbers, I don't see a scam (assuming that the TH/s were actually delivered of course). Based on the prices of the equipment, I'd say it was a pretty fair deal, actually - mining is just not profitable unless you are the hardware manufacturer, are able to get extremely cheap power, and/or are able to get the hardware at a good price.

The 20th percentile basically means that 80% of hashing power has to agree to raise it at least this high. This seems to be a reasonable choice, no matter who proposed it.
We just need to make sure the same is true for lowering: 80% of hashing power should have to support a lowering, meaning here we need to take the 80th percentile. I believe this might still be the intention, and just forgotten in the quick e-mail clarifying the meaning of the "most common floor" wording. If not, just taking the 20th percentile indeed enables a 21% attack and would be an even worse idea than never raising the block size limit in the first place.

Only true if the change is compatible. For example, 51% of the mining power could decide that the block size is now 100 KB, but they cannot decide that it is larger than that. They can fork, but they can't change what the network of "old" nodes accepts.
This is also why I'm highly sceptical of any "we can't raise the hard limit too high" argument, btw - 51% of the miners can set the limit as low as they want by completely rejecting blocks that are bigger. If a miner decides to mine a block below the hard limit but over those miner's soft limit, it will be orphaned.

Nope.

(TLDR: Instead of paying someone by broadcasting a tx, you give them the signed tx. Lots of clever tricks with multisig and timelocked transactions to prevent doublespends and allow chains of transfers to form. As long as everything works, nothing touches the chain, if an actor misbehaves, the prepared transactions can be used to settle.)

It's a limit for network messages. Before the 1 MB limit was introduced, you could have mined a 35 MB block, and it would technically be valid, but you would not have had any way to send it to anyone unless you both speak a non-standard protocol.

No - in theory (according to the Satoshi paper), they would derive more value from cooperating (i.e. mining honestly like everyone else) than trying to run a double-spend.
The fear comes from the fact that they could if they wanted, undermining trust. Even if a miner has sufficient resources, it may be more profitable for him to limit himself to significantly below 50% to avoid the fear of a 51% attack, since that fear could destroy the value of the bitcoins he's going to mine.

Who would issue the certificates indicating which phone numbers someone owns?
Someone has to do the verification. That is currently the companies who offer SIP access. The security model is that low-level access to the phone network where you can specify a caller ID is restricted to "trustworthy" companies, enforced by classic means (non-trivial bar of entry = no sybil attacks, kicking out abusers, the legal system).
Changing this is something that isn't going to happen anytime soon.
If Bitphone wants to do this themselves, there's no need for certificates or keys, they just do the verification.

Imagine this:
Imagine that you've seen what happens with money in bank accounts when the government gets greedy, so you bought Bitcoin. Imagine you've seen what happens with Bitcoin on an exchange, so you kept the Bitcoin yourself. Imagine you've seen what happens with Bitcoin on a computer, so you've gotten a physical electronic wallet.
Imagine one run of chips had a bad mask or something and the PRNG was broken. Imagine someone finds out. Imagine this someone uses this trick to take all your retirement money. Or doesn't, because your wallet wasn't affected - they just take other people's money, dump it on the market, and make the value of your money drop 75%.
Or imagine your house burns down, with the trezor and the copy of your wallet seed in it. Or imagine you put a copy of your wallet seed elsewhere, and someone - possibly someone you trusted - got access to it and stole all your coins to fund their drug habit. Or imagine you were clever enough to encrypt it with a secure passphrase, but can't remember it anymore.
Storing Bitcoin securely is hard. I still haven't found a *good* way to do so ([contribute ideas here](
Edit: Doesn't mean you shouldn't use Bitcoin, but please for the love of Cthulhu, stop advertising it as safer than bank accounts.

Freeze *temporarily*, since the deposited funds will be secured with a timelocked transaction.
I'm summarizing this off the top of my head, so it might not be accurate, but I think it works roughly like this:
- You and the service deposit some coins, say 100 mBTC each, into a shared account (on-chain). Each of you has a TX that will "unlock" the coins by sending the 200 mBTC to an intermediate output (output_intermediate_you, and output_intermediate_service). A tx sending 100 mBTC to you and 100 mBTC to the service from these accounts (i.e. giving everyone what's theirs) exists for both of them, but is only valid 3 days after the corresponding output was funded. You have the tx sending to output_intermediate_you and both payout tx'es, the service has the one sending to output_intermediate_service and both payout tx'es. Any party can broadcast them if the other party stops working as expected.
- If the value of the shared account changes, e.g. because someone sends you 50 mBTC via the service (you now hold 150 and the service holds 50), a new account is created off-chain (via TX from the old account) and the old one is revoked: A tx sending all coins from output_intermediate_you to the service is created and signed, and a tx sending all coins from output_intermediate_service to you is created and signed. If the service tries to take your money by broadcasting the tx that funds output_intermediate_service, they'll have to wait three days until they can actually withdraw the 100 mBTC. However, you can and should immediately send the "revocation" tx, which gives all the money to you because they misbehaved.
Look up the official documentation, some of the presentations explain it really well and it's really interesting.

They also completely remove the spike when a new block is found. While they only halve the total traffic, they significantly reduce the available bandwidth you need for quickly obtaining blocks.
With 10 MB blocks, you need an average bandwidth of 17 KB/s. If you have anything faster than ISDN, you can run a 10 MB block node, bandwidth-wise (you want more than that for mining etc. since you never want to fall behind, but 17 KB/s is the point where running a node becomes feasible).

I believe that Classic also has some economic support, although I don't know how much.
Ultimately, the miners have the power to kill the original chain in two ways: just abandoning it (causing hour-long block times for many weeks) and dumping their oldchaincoins on exchanges to make it financially unattractive to mine the old chain, or a way-more-than-51%-attack creating a long empty chain with fake timestamps to raise the difficulty (AFAIK luke-jr demonstrated this on some small altcoin a long time ago). You can of course resurrect it with a new hashing function, but then it's yet another hardfork.
I mentioned 75% because I think that was the original majority required - that might have changed. I do believe that if a fork happens, it will be with significantly more than that.

Freedom is an illusion. Most of the things you do with your freedom will impinge on the rights upon others.
Let's take the simple example of land ownership. Should you have the freedom to decide who can enter your land, or should others have the [freedom to roam]( through it? Both are valid approaches. Finding a balance is hard.
Should you have the freedom to dump chemical waste into the river, or should you have the right to not have your river contaminated by other people dumping chemical waste into it?
Should you have the freedom to learn saxophone, or should your neighbor have the right to never be disturbed? Should you have the freedom to play saxophone all day and all night, or should there be some reasonable limits? Should you have the freedom to shoot your saxophone-playing neighbor that has kept your from sleeping for the past 48 hours, or should he have a right not to be shot?
In the end, you get laws. You get regulation. They will be decided one way or the other, be it some form of democratic government or gated communities having HOA-style laws. At some point, people are going to be born into a system where such rules are everywhere, and they'll have to accept them even though they never really agreed to them. Aaaand you're back where we are now, only possibly with less democracy.
It gets even more interesting once you start asking questions like whether you should have the freedom to sell yourself into slavery.

Encryption doesn't protect you against attacks while the system is powered on and the file system is mounted, on either platform. Very similar screen lock bypasses existed on desktop linux distros. [Here's]( one for which I found a source but I think there also was one that just crashes the screenlock with a long password or something similar (and I'm not talking about grub with the 27 backspaces).
On Linux, an attacker with physical access to a powered-off encrypted machine can easily replace parts of your boot chain. On Android (at least Nexus devices), there is no way to unlock the bootloader without wiping the storage. (On the other hand, if you have a phone without hardware-backed encryption, destructive off-chip attacks may allow an attacker to break your likely much weaker passphrase.)
The important part is not encryption though, IMHO, the important part is what happens during regular use. On desktop Linux, any application you run has, by default, access to all user data. Notably, your browser has access to your wallet and your keyboard. On Android, the operating system prevents one application from accessing the data of another application or interfering with certain critical components like the keyboard. On both platforms, vulnerabilities in the browser exist. On both platforms, local privilege escalation exploits are discovered from time to time that will let an attacker who has code execution in the context of one application get root access - however, on desktop, the attacker doesn't even need this! On Android, an attacker would first have to compromise an app, and in most cases, would then have to successfully perform LPE without crashing the kernel. On Linux, any code execution vulnerability in any of your apps means you lost.
Stagefright was such a huge deal because it was the first really big Android vulnerability since a long time that potentially allowed you to get code execution in a privileged process remotely. Stagefright-equivalent bugs are patched in desktop web browsers with almost every release, just check the release notes. Other document viewers are also not much better.
Obviously, if you have a phone that isn't receiving updates, you're more or less fucked. This is indeed a problem in the Android ecosystem if you are unlucky enough to have a non-Nexus device, but getting better now. If you're an absolute expert, you can of course further harden your Linux too. But assuming the average technically-savvy user who doesn't do stupidly risky things (e.g. unlock the bootloader, install software from outside the official repositories), I still maintain that Android is at least on par, but likely better, than desktop Linux. Because visiting a web site is less likely to give the attacker access to your wallet.
(btw, I'm wondering a bit - how does e.g. Ubuntu handle executables and .desktop files on removable media? Could I make an ext3-formatted thumb drive with a file that looks like a folder in the default viewer, but will be executed if you double-click it? Yes, that's social engineering, but very plausible if there is no obvious visual indicator telling you what is going to happen.)

You didn't do the math and bought a product without fully understanding it. I don't know if Genesis was trying to sucker people into doing so (likely, tbh), but of course a certain number of TH/s will result in a declining income over time as difficulty rises, and with a fixed maintenance fee (a large part of which is electricity cost), it will become unprofitable.
From what I see, you received a reasonable interpretation of a *lifelong* contract: A contract for the *useful service life* of that generation of miner. And I did the math, and the price was [not particularly horrible]( except that of course you won't be profitable on top of a hosted service in an industry where the margins are pretty thin.
If the maintenance fee was properly disclosed, the only thing you could have asked for is "please let me pay you a service fee exceeding the profits to keep the miners running" (could make sense e.g. if you were able to and interested in pointing them at a different pool, e.g. to mess with altcoins).

Many people on the Classic side believed that at the very least some members of the Core team silently approve of those attacks, or may even encite them.

This. This is almost certainly a block of slightly-less-than-239 bytes of data, encrypted with `openssl enc`.
The bad news is that if the passphrase was chosen well, you won't be able to break it. The good news is that `openssl enc` is really bad at deriving keys from passwords, making it relatively easy to break, so if the passphrase is weak, you (or rather a specialized service like walletrecoveryservices) may have a chance.
Even assuming an average word length of 8 characters plus one space (I think most of the words are shorter), that would be at least 24 words to get close to that file size. Either a strong (24 word) seed, or multiple seeds, or some extra text in the file, or some different format/multiple formats.

Bandwidth is a non-issue. Block propagation is but we have good solutions for that (thin blocks, the block relay network which uses many such optimizations...)
Why is bandwidth a non-issue? Well, 10 MB blocks means 1 MB *per minute*. That's 17 KB/s. Add tx data if you don't use thin blocks etc., make that 50 KB/s - still under 512 kbit/s. If your Internet sucks *that* much, then yes, you can't run a full node.
If your Internet sucks a bit less but still sucks, then yes, your mining profit will be lower. Get real Internet and use the block relay network and it is a non-issue again.
If you need to put your mining farm in a place where your Internet sucks REALLY hard, put your full node somewhere where the Internet doesn't suck that hard and just forward the header that you're going to mine on. With encryption, authentication, UDP/IP headers etc, that should be about 150 *byte* per second that you need. That's 1200 bits/s. That's where you start talking about baud again. If you don't have that, you need to get a phone line and ask your local museum for [one of these](

Have a look at the [2014 scalability roadmap](
Headers first and libsecp256k1 are implemented, and the block relay network was already implemented as the roadmap was written. These improvements alone are sufficient to make today's Bitcoin network faster with 4 MB blocks than the old Bitcoin network would have been with 1 MB blocks.
The linked roadmap gives good reasons why we can and should proceed with larger blocks. It also gives a *very* reasonable definition of what should stay possible: 


Note the "reasonably fast computer and Internet connection" - it doesn't have to run on an old Nokia brickphone using dialup in the middle of nowhere. Extending the "half their CPU and bandwidth" rule to other resources, a reasonable assumption would be at the very least 2 previous-generation i5 cores, 4 GB of RAM, 250 GB of disk and 25 Mbit down/5 Mbit up. Those are rather conservative assumptions, and should still be comfortably enough to run a 4 MB node.
I think that following the 2014 scaling roadmap would mean releasing a 2 MB block size patch months ago.

The exchange rate you get when buying Bitcoin with a credit card will make this unattractive. It's usually pretty bad because it has to account for CC fees and fraud.
You're also exposing yourself to the volatility of Bitcoin. If you buy a lot of Bitcoin and it loses 25% of its value overnight (which can happen) you'd probably be in a very bad spot. Don't put more money into Bitcoin than you can afford to lose!
However, you don't need cash, do you? So you could just buy everything you need with your 0% APR card (or does that 0% APR only apply if you pay it off in full?).

And this is exactly the reason why sending it back to the original address is easier - most people don't know how to do it.
Long story short, an address maps to a cryptographic keypair which is used to sign transactions sending money from that address. Using the right software, you can sign other messages, e.g. arbitrary text, and on the other side, using the right software, one can verify that the message was signed with the key belonging to an address.
Since this is an advanced feature, by far not all clients support it, and if they do, it might be hidden in a command-line interface.
I'm not sure if the official Bitcoin client exposes it in the GUI, it definitely does via a command line command/RPC call. Mycelium supports it by selecting the HD account in the accounts tab, then selecting "Sign message" from the three-dot menu.

To be accepted, it is generally helpful to explain one's position and to not dismiss the arguments of the other side. If someone is already convinced of one position with religious zeal, your arguments aren't going to sway him. But if someone is unconvinced, and gets a honest explanation with a bunch of good technical arguments from one side, and then a "you're just a noisy complainer, go away" from the other side, he's probably going to side with the former.
A big part of why Classic is so successful is likely that jtoomin pointed out the important parts of his presentation out in Chinese and offered to actually *talk* to the miners and work *with* them, instead of just telling everyone how things should be and dismissing any counterarguments like Core. This is a good strategy even if the other side is wrong and illogical.
Core didn't lose my support just through their refusal to adopt big blocks - while that made me *prefer* Classic, the "ivory tower" attitude and the deceptive Opt-in-RBF FAQ on the Bitcoin Core site convinced me that Core is just outright bad.

It doesn't seem to have much of a network effect - that seems to have gone to Ethereum.

I thought about something like this. My approach would be: If you are Greek and want BTC, make a handwritten (harder to shop) sign with your BTC address, go to a place that has StreetView, and take 2 pictures with your sign in front of a StreetView-able place from different angles. Possibly add something to keep the same person from doing it over and over. (This is one problem I haven't fully solved yet. I guess you could require a face and do face detection, but people who value freedom should not perpetuate such intrusive technology.)
Then have people who want to donate randomly pick a picture, check whether it looks shopped, and send the coins to the address that is verified to belong to someone who was able to physically place something in Greece.

No. Classic requires a certain majority (e.g. 75% of the last 1000 blocks) indicating support for bigger blocks (and then possibly a grace period) before allowing big blocks. Thus, the only change you will see is a different client identifier, and assuming they also mine on that node, some kind of flag in the mined block headers.
Once the majority is hit and any possible grace period has passed (AFAIK this will take at least ~4 weeks total), Bitcoin Classic nodes will be willing to accept and create bigger blocks, and likely soon after, the first bigger block will be mined.
Bitcoin Classic nodes will continue to mine on it, while Bitcoin Core nodes will reject it. Thus, there is a certain chance (e.g. around 10% if 80% use Bitcoin Classic) that it will be orphaned - Classic nodes will accept Core blocks, but not the other way around. At some point however, Classic miners will build a sufficiently long chain behind a large block that Core will not be able to catch up. At that point, the big fork has begun.
Unless one party gives in, the fork will continue. However, at the point where overwhelming miner consensus exists, it is likely that the smaller fork (i.e. Core) will be abandoned, or rather, that Core will concede and merge a 2 MB patch. Thus, the small block branch will become a useless historical artifact and the big block branch will stand undisputed as the main chain.
@_date: 2016-02-01 23:18:23
You are absolutely correct - a decision for Classic would be an open rejection of the Core scaling plan. Which I don't consider surprising, since many see it as too slow (or even a delaying tactic) and too complex.
I consider it likely that as soon as it is clear that miners and other big players support big blocks, Core will give up on the current scaling plan and merge a 2 MB patch to avoid a contentious fork, stay relevant, and possibly end this civil war that is nothing but disgusting on all sides.
@_date: 2017-04-06 23:12:46

You can, but BTC-E will want to be paid with USD from your bank account, and this transaction will result in USD on Bitfinex that you can't get out.
If Bitfinex starts working again, you'll make a decent profit, at the price of having your money locked up until then. OTOH, if Bitfinex goes the Mt. Gox way, you just exchanged your valuable Bitcoin for worthless numbers on a doomed exchange.
If it were easy, fast, guaranteed profit, enough people would be doing it to make the difference disappear.
The Poloniex price is misleading because it's not USD, it's USDT, which seems to be roughly equivalent to "USD on Bitfinex".

Is running bitcoind with eatmydata safe for initial sync in the case of a bitcoind (but not kernel) crash?
Obviously, if the OS/kernel/machine crashes/reboots, the data on disk has to be deleted, but that might be a fair deal for initial sync if it speeds it up significantly. OS crashes are rare and easily detectable.
bitcoind is crashy (esp. on 32-bit systems) so if a *bitcoind* crash with fsync disabled kills the files, it would probably not be worth it.

No, but I could have if I wanted. If I were running a Bitcoin-accepting service that doesn't just use one of those "accept bitcoin get USD" payment processors, I'd obviously use the node for that. If I had a large transaction to verify, I could easily ssh into the box and check its status.

The claim that deploying thousands of Classic nodes would be a sybil attack preventing to find Core nodes seems questionable.
Spinning up ~5000 Classic nodes would mean ~50% of nodes are Classic. Even for a misconfigured node that only has 8 connections, the likelihood of not having any Core node amongst the peers is thus 0.5^8 = 0.4%. For a correctly configured node with 20 connections, 0.0001%.

Not true. YouTube doesn't decide copyright disputes. There are two kinds of takedowns, Content ID and DMCA. I believe you got DMCA'd. If your video got DMCA'd, you can file a DMCA counter notice. That is a legal notification that you think you do have the rights to the video.
The DMCA process works like this: Lawyers send a DMCA notice to Youtube. Youtube is by law required to take the video down. However, you can file the counter-notification. Once you file it, Youtube will forward it to PayPal, including your contact information which you have to include. Now, PayPal has to sue you within ~2 weeks and provide evidence they did so to YouTube. If they don't, the video is reinstated.
The EFF has an excellent page explaining it: 
That said, Fair Use law is notoriously murky. If you throw 2 lawyers into a room with a video, the two lawyers will probbaly come out with five different opinions whether it is fair use or not. Thus, I can't blame you for not trying to go the counter-notification route and just re-upload it.
Also note that ANY US video provider follows this law. If Paypal reads this post and didn't read the Wikipedia page on the Streisand effect yet, they'll probably send DMCA notices to all of the hosts above, and they *will* take it down.

It's OK for you not to run a full node all the time. That's why we run them. To make it easier for guys like you to use the network.

That's also why I consider the concerns regarding block size ridiculous. The box I'm running this on is as cheap as it can get and still enough to handle it, and I ran way more expensive servers just to support free networks. And I'm far from alone.

You need that passphrase. If you can't find the text file, the most economical way of recovering your coins is to create a new wallet using a software that uses hierarchical deterministic wallets, *back it up properly* (write down the seed), send $25 to an exchange and buy some new coins.
If this was a large amount, attempting to recover the text file or to brute-force the passphrase (only feasible if you remember parts of it or it was chosen weakly) might make sense, but for $25, it's probably not worth your time.
Assuming you were on windows, a small text file was probably stored in the MFT, which means it's probably completely gone by now if you indeed deleted it instead of just misplacing it.
You could also try to check for system recovery checkpoints containing the file. You say the file is "gone" but you didn't mention how - did you forget where you put it, accidentally delete it, ...?

As with any computing device it *can* be hacked, and you certainly shouldn't use it to store your retirement savings, but I'd still trust a phone over a computer.

For block chaining and proof of work, yes. In some other places (IIRC transaction signing) it uses a RIPEMD160(SHA256(value)). That means that if you could brute force 160 bit hashes, you could probably spend someone else's coins. The idea is that chaining the functions would protect you against some cryptographic attacks, and 160 bits was a conscious choice to keep addresses short.
But again, 2^80 gives you purely theoretical collision attacks, while what you'd need would be a practical preimage attack, so no need to worry too much there.

1. Price can go up, meaning miners stay profitable even with smaller block subsidies. That could help up to the point where they completely disappear.
2. Fees per tx can go up. There is, however, likely a limit of what the market will bear. Unless Bitcoin turns into a pure settlement network, a tx fee &gt;$1/tx will likely make it very unattractive (especially as international markets grow together and "classic" players start offering cheap centralized solutions, either because new players enter or because the old ones are afraid of Bitcoin). That means that the total fees per block will be at most $1-2k.
3. Growth + block size increase. If more transactions fit into a block, miners can make a decent profit even without ridiculously high per-tx fee.

To pubkeys directly, that's the problem with the early ones.
Another problem is obviously coins that are stored in addresses whose pubkeys are known (due to address reuse), but there is some hope at least the big holders will move them when quantum computing becomes a concern. But with some of the early coins, it is likely Satoshi isn't coming back to move them.

Remember that you don't just have BTC. You also have BCH, BTG (not worth much but 75 of them is still &gt;$2k right now), and probably a lot of other forks and airdrops. Make sure to figure out what you have and to cleanly fork them. **Keep all old keys, including ones that you think are empty**.


The rational approach is: You have a certain amount of money (money in your bank accounts + value of your coins + value of whatever other investments you have). Decide how you want to invest this, and then make reality match that plan. (You may need to take taxes into account, which may make it a bad idea to sell everything at once.)
Bitcoin is highly speculative. It could literally go 10x or 0.1x within a week. Make sure you're OK with either outcome. If you sell and it goes 10x, you'll cry "why did I sell so much", if you don't sell and it crashes to 10% of its value, you'll cry "why was I greedy and didn't sell".

"Don't invest money in Bitcoin that you're not willing to lose" applies here. If you're OK with going from not having the coins to having the coins to not having the coins, sure, you can consider HODLing, if losing them now would *really* hurt you, you need to sell.

It won't cripple spy agencies. It will give them work for years.
Once they get a quantum computer, they can decrypt all your past HTTPS connections that they have stored, including the ones supposed to have "perfect" forward secrecy.
It will also be much less of a problem for centralized systems while being pretty bad for Bitcoin - for example because quantum attackers will be able to get access to all the coins that were mined early and then never moved, unless the network decides to invalidate them via a soft fork, which would be very very controversial.

Someone [further down]( posted an interesting theory claiming (I quote):




[Archived tweet]( if it gets deleted. I was unable to find a reputable source regarding the allegations, so here's a [dailybeast article](
Keep in mind that outside of the world of Bitcoin exchanges, most of the times when you see a reputable company do things like that, it's usually either:
* customer service having screwed up really bad, and the outcry may be necessary to get the case escalated and fixed
* someone who has been abusing the service (e.g. online game cheaters) and gotten caught trying to generate public outcry to pressure the company into reversing their decision since they have nothing to lose. You all have probably seen the rare yet hilarious cases where game cheaters/toxic players trying this get called out by an admin.
With Bitcoin exchanges, you also get compliance issues added to the mix.
Don't let that keep you from screaming - companies often need a kick in the butt to do customer service, and having a cost associated with customer-hostile decisions is a good thing. But don't forget that sometimes the story you're told isn't the whole story.

One reason would be wanting to get confirmed in the next block, even if it is mined by one of the miners who have a limit.
It will also be many years until the block subsidy goes away completely. Given the price rise, miners are making more $ off the 12.5 BTC block subsidy than they were ever making off the 50 BTC subsidy.
With bigger blocks, they also can make a lot of money from rather low fees. With 5k transactions in a block (won't be much more even with segwit) each would have to pay over $10 to pay for the current block subsidy. Make blocks 100x as big (not today - when the subsidy starts running low/out) and $0.10  per tx is enough.

A company that cares more about keeping their platform "clean" than about the fate of individual articles or authors, like almost all other platforms.
They most likely had a problem that people were using Medium to post scams that use cryptocurrency (like "send X bitcoin to this address, get twice the amount back"). So they built automated spam detection, which treats the existence of the word "bitcoin" in an article as an indicator that it is likely spam/scammy. It's not a hard filter, so not all Bitcoin-related articles will be filtered, but a random Bitcoin-related article likely has a much, much higher chance of accidentally being caught up in it.
It's extremely unlikely that someone from Medium sat down and decided "fuck anonymous usage of Bitcoin in particular".

Of course, please see the [comment further up](




You'd have to find a practical preimage attack on RIPEMD160(SHA256(x)). For an individual hash function, cryptographic weaknesses sometimes reduce the effort required to bruteforce it enough to make it feasible but still hard. For two chained ones, good luck (especially as the attacker typically doesn't even know the result of the SHA256, so even if they had a full break on SHA256 they couldn't do much).
I know directory.io, love it!

I thought that the problem with Greenaddress is that they hold one key in a 2-out-of-2 multisig scheme, so if they don't sign your tx you can't split at all.
This API is there to get them to use their private key to put their signature on a multisig splitting transaction, and seems to be as raw and difficult to use as it could reasonably be.

Depends... if you set up 2of3 and didn't lose your keys, you're good to go and can recover both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, since you hold the majority of the keys.
If you are using 2of2, then the only way to recover is a pre-signed nLockTime transaction. You can enable that (and they'll e-mail it to you), but that only means that if Greenaddress goes away, you will be able to recover your Bitcoin after the lock time expires. However, since this is a pre-signed transaction, it does not allow you to withdraw your BCH.
The only way to withdraw the BCH from a 2of2 accuont is to have a transaction signed by you and Greenaddress. The API provides a (complicated) way to get their signature. Without their signature, you couldn't get your coins.

Fetching the privkey vs storing it locally/in the installer shouldn't make a difference. A malicious party can simply download the key themselves.

If you bought $1k of Bitcoin in January 2016, and sold today, you'd have ~$25k now.

Also, this is one of the reasons why it's a bad idea to try to operate the system at its limits.
If blocks were larger, a different miner could easily pick those transactions up, and the loss of capacity from mining a not-full block wouldn't be anything to cry about.
@_date: 2017-09-07 18:36:30
Thanks, that seems to be relatively new. Glad they came to their senses. In their [blog post]( they state that future splits will likely not be supported, so if you want to keep the full value of your coins, including any potential dividends, they're probably a really bad choice.
It doesn't matter whether you think that Bitcoin Cash is good or bad, whether you want to hodl it or dump it immediately, the fact is that if you got it, you had about $300 (IIRC) worth of additional value per coin at the time when the split happened. Keeping your coins on a wallet that may not let you sell the altcoins belonging to you is a great way to lose out.
@_date: 2017-09-07 20:18:30


Because he at least admits this fact, and so far hasn't stolen anything.
*Any* software wallet that has Internet access could have a 'send private key to the developer' "feature" hidden in the next update.
Hardware wallets could be backdoored by the developer to generate weak keys that the dev (but nobody else) can guess. If you reuse addresses, they could do the same with weak nonces.
Trezor is using a web wallet as the primary frontend software, so a malicious firmware update (that exposes the keys to the USB interface) + a malicious update to the web wallet (that takes the keys from the USB interface and pushes them to the dev) would be possible.
You're not just trusting the devs not to do that. You're also trusting the devs to protect themselves against attacks that would give the attacker the power to abuse the developer's identity and credentials to perform the same attack.
The best protection is using a hardware wallet, connected to a trusted computer, and using a software from a *different* developer to interact with the hardware wallet. That way, if the HW wallet is malicious, it can expose the key but there will be nothing on the computer to take it from the wallet and send it away, and if the software is malicious, it cannot access the key because it's on the hardware wallet. (If both are malicious and working together against you, you're fucked, of course.)
@_date: 2017-09-07 19:56:02
My understanding is that if you use Greenaddress, you're using either 2of2 or 2of3, with the former being the default, even if you don't enable 2FA. The documentation says "Your main GreenAddress account is a 2of2 account." 
@_date: 2017-09-19 15:25:38


You still have to worry about e.g. the team behind Trezor, or more likely, someone who has hacked them, managing to sneak something nasty into the next firmware and then the wallet.
Or them (or the chip maker) fucking up the PRNG.
Add to that the trouble of securing the backup of the seed.
After adding all this (and all the other issues) up, I'm not sure it's worse than the counterparty risk with a major exchange (plus all the other risks you take when using an exchange).
Then keep in mind the cost of the Trezor itself, which can be prohibitive if you only want to invest a small amount.
On a related note, does anyone know how exchanges handle it when someone gets phished or hacked? I've seen [reports]( of coinbase refunding some people who got hacked. Does anyone know how other exchanges handle it? Because if they do refund users who took reasonable precautions, storing your coins on an exchange may be safer than holding your own keys where you're 100% fucked if you get hacked. As long as an exchange doesn't have their cold wallet stolen (or slowly drained without noticing) the major ones will remain solvent.
(Not recommending coinbase - I've heard a lot of horror stories about them. Probably just extremely overwhelmed support but still enough to cause a nightmare).

The deterministic build and mixing in randomness from the computer are definitely great moves, wasn't aware of those two (despite trying to read the code). Thanks! [Here's the source]( for the entropy mixing if anyone is wondering.


Doesn't protect against a batch of bad chips. Has happened before (Taiwan eID card), will happen again. But the deterministic builds make it much harder (not impossible) to backdoor the firmware and the mixing of randomness resolves the issue with bad chips, so that is pretty great.

To put this in context: mining one block requires, on average, around 2^73 guesses, which is already an *insane* number. Remember, this is *all* the guesses that *all* the miners in the world do, with entire farms of specialized hardware, in 10 minutes.
And if you didn't pay attention in math, 2^256 is not "five times as hard as 2^(73)". Making 2^74 guesses is *twice as hard*. Making 2^146 guesses is 2^73 times as hard.
If you had a supercomputer that could make 2^73 guesses (i.e. the combined work all miners together do in 10 minutes) 2^73 times every second (i.e. mine a block each time a miner on the network *tries a single hash*), and you'd let it run for 100 years (about 2^25 seconds each), the probability that you could correctly guess a specific key would be... zero. Specifically, 0.00000000000000000000%
Probably a few zeros more, I'm too lazy to count them accurately so I left some out.
You can't guess a properly generated key.

Prisoner's dilemma.


As long as it doesn't slow propagation too much, mining as many as he can fit would give him more money than mining a half-empty block (he'd of course include all higher-fee transactions first, this is just about leaving the space empty or filling it with cheap transactions).
However, if blocks are constantly full and small, as you said, one miner can only clear a small fraction of cheap transactions. Thus, even if some miners don't participate in a cartel, the cartel can continue to profit. If blocks were bigger, the one non cartel miner could collect all the small fees, and reduce the incentive to pay higher fees, breaking the cartel.

It is prisoner's dilemma: if all miners collaborate (refuse to mine low fee tx), they earn more, but an individual miner can make more by defecting (mining low fee transactions).
It *might* be that if no miners defect, a single defecting miner would reduce their own long-term revenue (because the money made from the extra transactions is less than what they lose due to reducing the fee level). This is increasingly unlikely the bigger the blocks are (more small fee tx) and the smaller the miner is (less affected by globally lowered fees)
However, if there is a risk that someone else will defect and soak up all the cheap tx, not defecting yourself means you risk the potential fee revenue while still paying the price for defection when it happens.
Bigger blocks make defection more likely, making it bad business to form such a cartel.

The attack isn't attacking the CA, the attack is going to the CA, saying "wallet.trezor.io is my domain, I'd like a cert". The CA will then verify that claim by... having you put a magic token in DNS or on the web site, then verify its presence.
If you as the attacker can get the CA to query your fake DNS/malicious web site, you will pass verification, the CA has no way of distinguishing you from being the owner, and it *will* gladly issue you a (domain-validated, non-EV) cert.
Unfortunately, this applies even to competent CAs. Let's Encrypt is planning to do domain validation from multiple independent points to make this harder, but I don't think they have started doing it yet.

Channels are only really useful if you use them in both directions. For consumers, that means there is an incentive for the channel they use to buy coins and the channel they use to spend them to be the same. For merchants, that means there is an incentive for the channel where they receive coins and where they sell them to be the same.
That means a channel to the exchange. The major exchanges will have channels with each other. If you want to go outside that network, you would have to withdraw your coins and commit them to a second channel, *then deal with someone who does the same*.
Congestion and absurd fees on chain will be very effective at discouraging that. As long as you stay within The Network, you don't have to pay the fees anyways, except for the initial channel open. The exchanges might rebalance their channels a couple times per day, they don't mind paying a couple hundred for that.
When an exchange goes bust, you'll be just as fucked as you are now because you won't be able to settle on chain in time, or the fees to settle will be higher than the value inside the channel.

The time to do this was years ago. Cancelling the agreed-upon fork for another empty promise would be insanity.

If you are willing to accept a small amount of risk, you can use SPV.
Running a full node isn't that expensive though. I suspect that you could run it on a [Scaleway C1]( server for 3-4 EUR/month if you get Bitcoin to compile. Otherwise, you can splurge and get a box [like this]( For 30 EUR/month, less than the typical cost of one residential Internet connection, you get a box that will be able to easily support a Bitcoin node and probably a lot of other things too (like your website and all the other things you want to run in your startup).
**The main cost is not the hardware, the main cost is the effort required to set it up and maintain it. This will likely apply to most of your IT cost** unless you start to scale really big. This is also why the big cloud providers get away with ridiculous prices - they offer convenience. This is also why third parties are so popular.

So they claim 128 GB of RAM would be needed for the UTXO set for a 32 MB block size, with 67200 tx/block to verify. At high queue depths, which would probably be realistic if you are looking up lots of tx in parallel, SSDs can do 100k IOPS per second.
I'm pretty sure you could dump the entire UTXO set on SSDs and still stay CPU-bound for verification speed. Note that you only need this if you need very quick verification, i.e. are mining or doing other large business with BTC, i.e. a thousand dollars a year for hardware are neglegible.
A 6 TB HDD is about $270 and would store 3 years worth of blockchain. By then, the next 6 TB will probably cost less than half of that. A Samsung 850 Pro 256GB SSD is ~$140.
**None of these items would actually be required until some time in the future when they will be significantly cheaper.**

I never understood how Bitcoin would make sense for remittances where the task is to send fiat and receive fiat (instead of going through an aggregator who takes the fiat on one end, directly transfers to the destination country/currency, and dispenses fiat there). I guess it might make sense if no sane aggregator exist.
What doesn't make sense is entire companies founded around the concept of being said aggregator, but replacing the bulk (aggregated) transfer of fiat between the two countries by buying, transferring, then selling BTC. At the point where you are doing bulk, commercial transfers, existing transfer methods are pretty clearly superior over buying and selling Bitcoin and exposing yourself to 2x exchange fees and volatility.

Facebook was slow to roll out Libra. Had Bitcoin not choked, it would now be *the* standard for international online payments imho. Now, the vultures are picking apart the carcass, and Bitcoin is slowly withering away.

The US seems to be the most insanely strict country when it comes to immigration requirements.
If you finished university and get a job offer for a job paying at least 50k EUR (which is reasonably possible for a fresh university graduate e.g. in IT), congratulations, you've fullfilled all the conditions you need to immigrate into the EU. The limit is even lower (38k) for certain in-demand jobs, e.g. doctors and engineers. There are no quotas.
Don't have the job offer yet? As long as you can demonstrate that you have the means to sustain yourself and have a university degree, here's a 6-month visa so you can look for a job.
Don't have a university degree yet? Demonstrate that you have enough money to support yourself for a year (~8000 EUR, doesn't have to be cash, scholarships or promises-to-pay from parents etc. can count), get a German university to accept you (not sure about the rules in other EU countries) and you'll get a residence permit for however long it takes for you to finish your studies plus 18 months so you can find a job afterwards. Oh, you can work while studying (within certain limits that should be high enough to earn enough to sustain yourself). I suspect that as long as you can demonstrate sufficient language skills and aren't picky, getting accepted isn't a problem and I think that even for foreign students the tuition fees are lower than your average public transport ticket (which I mention since it's often included in tuition). If you don't speak German, you can probably find a university that offers courses, but your ability to work will be limited.

For example, when your core business goes down the drain but a patent troll shows up with a briefcase full of cash and drool dripping from his face as he thinks of all the money he's going to be able to extort.
Establishing prior art can be done by defensive publication: Just publish what you would put into the patent at a scientific conference, done. Much easier and cheaper. It cannot be used offensively, but it establishes prior art. The downside is that if another Bitcoin company decides to go half-troll and sues you, you won't have anything to sue back. (A patent troll can't be sued back either way since they don't actually make anything useful. That's one of the reasons why they and their lawyers should be beaten with sticks and then handed to ISIS.)
The solution is to get patents and do patent-sharing agreements. So far, they have signed the patent pledge. This is worthless not only because it isn't legally binding, but also because it [only states]( "No first use of software patents against companies with less than 25 people."
Whether they are evil or not will show later. Applying for patents definitely isn't a sure sign of being evil, but since we won't know the truth until it is too late, I think the negative reaction is justified.
I'm a bit concerned by the lack of a clear commitment that some kind of patent sharing agreement will be made, but I can understand that since it brings limited benefits while severely limiting the freedom of the company. The explanation provided in the letter (they haven't figured it out yet) is perfectly plausible, but of course could also be used by an evil entity trying to deflect criticism.
**TL;DR**: There is no sign Coinbase is evil, but they could do more and *prove* they're not evil, and they haven't done that (for which there can be perfectly legitimate reasons).

It isn't. That's the point. As I said above... We're not talking about Bitcoin or a system that prevents rollbacks anymore. We're talking about a system that is auditable, i.e. a system that detects and proves rollbacks.
In a centrally controlled blockchains, orphaned blocks should not happen unless a rollback happened. Thus, if I have two valid chains, both correctly signed, one that contains a transaction I want and one that doesn't, I can prove that my transaction was rolled back, by showing the two signed chains to the judge.
*Within* the system, the central third party can invalidate transactions at a whim - but they can *NOT* do so without giving me proof that they did it.


Yes. That's the point. We're talking about banks using blockchains here. For... bank stuff.
Realistically, a rollback would not be done by rolling back this blockchain. It would be done by adding a note to the next block, saying "we are hereby rolling back this tx because ...". This way, it is transparent and auditable, and there is only one valid blockchain, demonstrating that it wasn't tampered with (aside from the rollback).
This no longer has anything to do with a decentralized currency, it's something completely different - an easily auditable ledger. 
As soon as they give me a signed block that says I gave them money, I don't have to fear that they set my account to 0, falsify their records, claim that my records are fake, and say they never got any money from me. They could add a note that I no longer have any money with them to the next block. They could orphan the block that says I gave them money. But they can't make it go away. I can go to the judge, show him my block, and since they weren't supposed to have two sibling blocks, ever, I'll get my money since they messed with the chain.
It's no different than if they gave me a digitally signed receipt saying "you gave us money", only that it's easier to audit when a lot of transactions happen.
It's a blockchain. It's not a cryptocurrency.

No. An evil miner could arbitrarily spam the blockchain by mining a huge block (at least in theory). While in practice there are limitations to this, it is possible that such an immense block could become part of the blockchain, bloating it arbitrarily, forever. I've seen more than one hour pass between blocks, so if a miner on a fast connection manages to mine a huge block like that and gets super lucky, they could bloat the chain e.g. by 10 MB/s * 3600 = 36 GB in a single block. More realistically, though, they'd make the blocks e.g. a minute "big", i.e. 600 MB in this example, to get them propagated quickly. Even if such a miner only had 10% of the hashing power, that's the equivalent of having ~60 MB blocks every block. And that assumes 10 MB/s between the evil miner and other miners. I suspect a lot of miners are reachable via a Gbit connection that is mostly idle, i. e. it could be 10 times as much.
With SPV miners, this could be even worse.

We're not talking about Bitcoin or a system that *prevents* rollbacks anymore. We're talking about a system that is auditable, i.e. a system that *detects* and *proves* rollbacks, and a centrally controlled blockchain provides that.

It probably won't help much. IIRC there is some official guidance like "a node below X Mbps probably won't help the network much". 
 says 2 Mbps up and down.
It *shouldn't* hurt the network, but given that the Tor code is far from optimal, that doesn't mean it doesn't.

**EDIT2**: I'm out of time, I missed a part (the RNG mixes in the time, repeatedly, when generating) but it might still  be recoverable. Will require bruteforcing though, and lots of it :(
DO THESE STEPS ON ANOTHER PC TO LIMIT DATA LOSS FROM RAM IF IT DOESNT WORK.
It is assumed you have the saved pool in array form in SAVED_POOL.
1. Generate a new wallet (QR codes need to be visible) using the same software if possible.
2. Open a JavaScript console (F12) and run the next two commands:
3. `SecureRandom.pool = SAVED_POOL`
4. `ninja.wallets.singlewallet.generateNewAddressAndKey()`
If you have it in hex format, ensure there are no spaces etc. and use hexToBytes:
    SAVED_POOL = ninja.wallets.splitwallet.hexToBytes("YOUR HEX HERE")
If you used a different wallet type, you'll probably have to replace "singlewallet" above and use the same type to recreate it.
I have successfully generated the same wallet twice using the method above. That said, I'm not sure how you managed to recover the seed pool, nor confident that you got the right one. If you did, this is your best bet.
Otherwise, try to recover it from RAM, but that's not my area of expertise. I'd probably try to dump the RAM somehow (that's the hard part, research using a different machine and be quick :/) and then look for BTC key like strings, and brute force all of them.
Edit: I tried again and now can't reproduce my results, sorry :/

For example:
* selling it once you are in said country and don't care about being tracked
* (depending on local laws) after the statute of limitations has expired and you no longer have to worry about criminal prosecution
Of course, there is also the option of laundering it, but that can be risky. You can still do many parts of it anonymously over the Internet, without walking into a place where your face could be seen or you could be arrested.
I had a write-up here on how it could be done, but decided against posting it since I don't want to help criminals who are too dumb to figure it out themselves. Let's just say that repeated often enough, it should still leave you &gt;50% of the "dirty" coins as "clean" coins (much more than that if you don't want a really high security level), make it *very* hard to attribute, and provide a somewhat legitimate explanation for how you got the coins.

No, they already used up that "argument" to force Swiss banks to comply with their bullshit. One of the many questions in the KYC/AML is now "Are you a US person?", and if yes, bye bye.
Let that sink in. Imagine if Eritrea got US banks to cooperate, and you, as a US citizen, would be forced to answer the question whether you are a "Eritrea person" when trying to open a bank account in the US. Of course the forms would be in Eritrean, not English, too. That is the situation the US managed to impose on other countries.

The Torrent claim in the article ("This is only an efficient way of distributing a file if it is illegal to do so") is a huge heap of bullshit. What is interesting about Torrent is that you only need bandwidth to upload the file a few times in order to distribute it to thousands of users. Which is why 100% legit applications like the [Blizzard downloader]( (used to install World of Warcraft etc.) use it to distribute their files.

The WU fee is less than 1%, end-to-end, even according to an ad of a competitor.
Buying Bitcoin at Coinbase already hits you with a 1% fee, making this uneconomical. On top of that, there tends to be a difference between buy and sell price (*spread*), which can also be used to hide additional fees (not sure if zebpay does it but offering no/low fees is a sign that they might).
If you ignore the spread and manage to exchange cheaply, you *might* be able to beat existing money transmitters in price, but you'll have a hard time doing so and it will probably be less convenient and not necessarily faster either.

Even if split funding is allowed, a default still means that a funder/depositor/investor/whateveryoucallit immediately loses (some of) their deposit.
What would be closer to a bank would be having people fund a *pool* of loans, that is sufficiently large and in total generates enough interest to cover defaults within the pool. This way, if someone defaults, depositors don't immediately lose any of their deposit, it's just slightly less profitable.
That would require whoever makes the pools to do due dilligence, and at that point we're back to a bank whether you call it a bank or not. Those p2p lending sites "work" by not doing their due dilligence, taking some profit of every loan, but offloading the risk of default to naive people who fall for their lies. Some may even get lucky and make a profit, while others get burned. The house always wins and has no strong incentive to do their due dilligence as long as they can keep the appearance up.

There is no proof of work, so it's easy to cheat and hard to incentivize properly. Aside from that, the nodes that are currently run (either by businesses interested in BTC, people playing around with it, or volunteers who have spare resources and want to support the network) are more than enough, so there is no need to incentivize it.
Given how cheap it is to run a node, I believe that this will not be a problem for a long time. Even with bigger blocks. Just look at how many Tor nodes there are. Coincidentally, if a dedicated server is only running Tor, adding Bitcoin to it usually wouldn't be a problem resource-wise, since Tor eats lots of bandwidth and lots of CPU, but no disk space and little RAM, and Bitcoin mostly eats lots of disk space, some RAM, some CPU which can be `nice`d, and a neglegible amount of bandwidth compared to Tor.

I've been saying this (and getting downvoted for it) since the "Bitcoin computer" came out.

No. A couple cents fee to send *Bitcoins worth a few hundred million* (at best, good luck buying that much in practice without completely messing up the market).
Add fees and spreads for buying and selling them to get the true cost of sending a certain amount of *dollars* using Bitcoin, and *good* "legacy" money transmitters end up being cheaper in many cases.
In the case of cash transfers, include deposit and withdrawal fees and transfer times. The Bitcoin transfer only takes an hour or a few hours for verification (depending on your luck), but turning cold hard cash into Bitcoin and back isn't instant.
Bitcoin can shine where no company is able/willing to do the transfer end to end (or they want ridiculous amounts of money) and the decentralized nature lowers the barrier of entry, creating cheap agents at both ends.
Some Bitcoin company advertised how  remittances using Bitcoin via them are cheaper than classic remittance providers. Once the comments did the real math it turned out the "legacy" providers were way cheaper.

Not really. Overwhelming node connectivity enables denial of service, selective hiding of transactions, and double-spend if and only if you accept unconfirmed transactions. It does not allow stealing your money or spoofing well-confirmed transactions.
Misbehaving miners that (together) have significantly below 50% are not a major problem. They can't effectively deny transactions since others can and will mine them, they can't spoof a well-confirmed transaction, they can't steal your money, ...
Miners did enable various variants of RBF which caused minor problems for zero-confirmation transactions, but that's about the extent of risks I can see.
Indeed, some corrections would be possible using friendly forks of the blockchain assuming 51% of mining power agrees, but that's not the idea behind Bitcoin.
I think that if that was the only thing keeping Bitcoin secure while quantum computer became "widespread" (i.e. known to be in the hands of a few companies), just the possibility of an attack would be enough to destroy trust and thus adoption and value.
Also, a possible realistic hard-to-prevent attack is a large company having a quantum computer, and an employee or intern with access to it running a small script written at night against one or multiple of [the super-rich addresses that have their pubkey exposed]( If you think that's unrealistic, you don't want to know what kind of things people run on supercomputer clusters under the guise of "maintenance burn-in tests". This requires no malicious miners or anything and couldn't be reverted unless we explicitly decided to throw away the "key holder owns the coins" maxime. While the number of exposed coins will likely go significantly down if this becomes a risk, I suspect that Satoshi's coins alone (often mined into unhashed pay-to-pubkey outputs!) would be enough to cause major economic problems when stolen. Unless these coins are moved or voided, they *will* be up for grabs to the first person who uses a quantum computer on them - which is just a question of time.

If they did it for you, they'd have to be willing to do it for everyone. It's easy to see how that could bust their margins and how they don't have the money to do that.
However, that's not your problem. They claim "You will receive the current price shown on the Buy, Sell and Checkout pages, at the time you initiate the transaction. This price is locked for 10 minutes while you checkout.", so they better have a way to deliver on it. They *still* advertise that.
They are likely not defrauding their customers intentionally, just a business unable to cope with, well, business. That still makes them untrustworthy, whether it can be legally considered fraud or not. Unless there is evidence that they've given refunds to/cancelled orders fo customers who called them and said "hey, I know I ordered yesterday, but the price has dropped and I don't want the coins at that price anymore", that's at the very least massively unethical.
What they said, basically, is "we cannot fulfill our obligations and hence won't do so". Normally, this would call for a bankruptcy.

No - they aren't safely usable even once, that's the problem. The security is broken the moment you *attempt* to use them (a signed tx spending the balance leaves your computer), not just after you successfully used them (said tx is included in the block chain).
This means that a malicious miner holding a quantum computer will mine on a block that includes his variant of your tx (signed with the key he broke), NOT your tx. This violates one of the security assumptions in Bitcoin (a miner that has significantly less than 50% of mining power should not be able to do any damage at all, and no miner should be able to move your coins).

If the nodes were signalling both 4 and 1, this would imply that if 45% support Segwit-only, and 55% support Segwit-only-with-a-hardfork, Segwit would happen but the hardfork would be extremely contentious and thus dangerous.
The people supporting this proposal are willing to activate segwit if and only if the rest of the network commits to 2 MB blocks. Segwit supporters don't get to lick the cream (segwit) off the cake and then take a dump on it.
Hence, a separate bit seems like the only sane way to do this, or am I missing something?
@_date: 2017-05-18 02:19:05
(I genuinely don't know the answer to this one) Can the same address or online payment QR code be used for both Segwit and non-Segwit transactions? Because if not, payment providers have an incentive to use old-style transactions (since otherwise it may not work properly for some of their customers, or they'll have to add an additional prompt, making it more complicated and thus raising the number of abandoned/aborted/failed transactions).
Either way, I'm pretty sure that everyone understood what I meant with the "actual" block size limit increase. This increase is meaningful because segwit only provides a one-time gain, while increasing the block size hard limit can be repeated as necessary as long as the network can handle it.

Technically, sure. Practically? Depends on how much mining power remains. With 80% of mining power gone, the old chain will be able to handle less than 20% of the previous transaction volume, for at least 8 weeks if the fork happens at a retarget point.
Additionally, the miners of the majority chain could decide to 51%-attack the minority chain, either at inception or retroactively. This makes it likely that the minority chain will be less valuable than the majority chain, especially if the majority chain has broad economic support (and the agreement looks like it will have that).
*That*, in turn, provides strong incentives for miners to mine the majority chain. Which means that the split will likely be much more one-sided than 80/20. So technically, there will be two chains, but I suspect the minority chain will be about as relevant as the other orphaned chains in the history of the blockchain.

Option 3: Move to a cryptocurrency that isn't saddled with a block size limit and civil war.
Option 4: Encourage a hard fork by agreeing to follow a big block chain.
Also, at this fee rate, 2 transactions/month are more expensive than a pruned full node which could probably support significantly more than 2 MB, with segwit or with a hard fork.
Also, UASF would only be a band-aid - once Segwit is enabled without a clear plan for on-chain scaling, transactions will be forced into on-chain solutions, with little hope to ever get the necessary on-chain scaling. Then prices will be driven up again until off-chain scaling vendors can collect the amount of fees that the network will tolerate ($1, apparently) while on-chain transactions will become unaffordable for anything but settlement. Companies offering Bitcoin services would do themselves a disservice by taking this band-aid, I think.

In *or before*. Just because the computer was disused for 5 years doesn't mean the Bitcoin client wasn't long forgotten about by the time he shoved it into a box.
\ is a very good point though. Nevermind that it sounds like booting up the old OS. Good luck getting such an old OS to boot on new hardware.
\ is also a good point. There was a time where mining was a matter of checking a checkbox in the client and ignoring the CPU usage and the fact that it didn't seem to do anything (unless it found a block)... and CPU-mining whole blocks was feasible back then, so I'm not concerned about that part. However, with 144 blocks per day (a bit more back then, probably, because the difficulty couldn't keep up) you're right about the weeks/months of mining at best.

The first two results on Google for "bitcoin quantum computer" are [this]( and [this]( Both seem to agree that Bitcoin as is would be more or less fucked. Which is a problem because unless we explicitly wipe out all coins stored in a non-quantum-safe way (i.e. in addresses for which the public keys are available), someone will likely get enough "forgotten/lost" coins to cause economic disruption.
The second link proposes Lamport Signatures. The problem with those is that they require public keys to be single-use (which is actually something Bitcoin could deal with, sort of), and they require them to consist of 320 160-bit hashes even if you're willing to accept that security level. That's 51200 bit or 6.4 KB per pubkey-and-signature. We're gonna need a bigger block...
@_date: 2015-11-05 23:38:30
I suspect that we also don't need to have as much mining as we currently do to maintain security. It's sufficient that there are not enough mining resources in potentially hostile hands. Thus, if a majority of miners turn off their rigs and keep them, we have a potential problem until the rest of the miners got more efficient rigs to make the old ones useless. However, if less people mine, and there isn't enough mining hardware (this includes any other hardware that could be used for mining, i.e. GPUs) around to reasonably do a 51% attack, we're fine.
In practice, this just means that there need to be enough miners around that existing mining equipment doesn't pose a threat, since general purpose hardware is probably far out of the game by now and will stay that for a long time.

Security is important to me. As someone specializing in IT security, I don't consider Bitcoin to be more secure than banking. If your credit card number gets stolen it's a hassle, if your keys are stolen you're shit outta luck. The risk that the banking system goes bust is there, but so can Bitcoin.
And if you now start claiming Bitcoin is secure if you do it correctly, think again. Even if you spend a hundred dollars on a Trezor it doesn't protect you against malware changing destination addresses on your PC and waiting until you pay someone. (As far as I know such malware exists in the wild).
And it doesn't protect you from some big holder getting hacked and the value dropping massively.
Nothing is safe, neither banks nor Bitcoin, and I don't think one is safer than the other. And this assumes that you know how to handle crypto properly, for the average person with no knowledge in IT security, banks are definitely a better option.

It's unclear whether there is a direct relationship between the two statements. Besides, segwit also needs wallet etc. adoption.
But most importantly, the article shows that he thinks core might never implement the hard fork, so his options from his perspective are activating segwit now and being stuck with "1.7" MB (actually much less due to limited segwit support) forever, or delaying segwit until core comes to its senses and getting "3.4 MB" (2 MB + segwit).

Sorry, should have made clearer what I meant. Obviously there would be intermediaries. What I meant is that 5-hop chains shouldn't happen, because your intermediary will have a channel with their intermediary. Unless you share an intermediary by lucky accident, the chains should be either two hops (three nodes total) or three hops (four nodes total), with the middle 1-2 hops being between large intermediaries.

The output of ripemd160 is 160 bits long, therefor, it is impossible to reverse it unambiguously for inputs with significantly more than 160 bits of entropy. I think finding a collision would be sufficient though. This becomes easier with quantum computers. However, you'd need to find a collision for SHA256, which, according to current public knowledge, is still as difficult as breaking a 128 bit hash function with a regular computer.
That means that once we have *quantum supercomputers* (which will be long after regular quantum processors are wide-spread), we really need to start to worry about that, since AFAIK 128 bit hash functions count as "too close for comfort".

If you actually have most of the key you'll be fine.
The main risks are:
* You actually wrote the public instead of the private key down. 
* You wrote down a different key.
If you did any of those and actually lost the original key, it's game over.
If you wrote the correct key down but fucked up a letter or two, you just have to try all plausible combinations (I.e. a limited brute force attack). It's not realistic to do it manually but easy to write a program for.
There is a professional wallet recovery service that does this and has a good reputation. They take a percentage of your coins but they are likely the easiest way to get this done. I think they are  - verify yourself. Do not send the maybe-incorrectly-written-down key to anyone you don't trust with your coins.

In this case, "distribute" would likely mean that all of them go to one entity


That assumes economic motives, which may not apply to large quantum computing users like intelligence agencies.
And it's not really self preservation - the cost of getting the coins is low. While getting and slowly selling them would be more profitable, getting them and using them to destroy bitcoin may be even more profitable.
Also, market manipulation. Buy options betting on a falling price, move coins, issue announcement... might allow an attacker to make money and destroy Bitcoin at the same time.

It isn't, though. Try cramming more than 1 MB of legacy transactions into a segwit block without a hardfork and see how it goes. The additional block space is only usable by those who use new addresses.
I also highly disagree with your estimate that "everyone wants a hardfork". Both the hardfork and segwit are contentious. Segwit due to the complexity it adds, the hardfork due to the perceived risk of a hardfork and concerns that blocks might become "too big".

If and only if you trust it not to go under. The upside is that if e.g. the migration to a new signature algorithm becomes necessary, they'll take care of it for you. The downside is that they might get hacked or cease operation.

Yes. Running a relay is stress-free, since you only connect to other Tor nodes. The exit node IP shows up as the source IP in all logs, so if someone gets hacked, the traffic came from your node.
If you're lucky and your police is competent, they know what Tor is. If you're unlucky and they are not competent, you'll get woken up by a SWAT team who thinks that you're selling children as sex slaves.
That's why running Tor nodes is best done by an organization, on a server in a datacenter, away from stuff you don't want taken down. By the time the police have figured out a door to kick in, they've most likely realized what Tor is.

Because payment providers will soon realize that they have to support additional currencies in addition to Bitcoin if they want to stay relevant, because only the most diehard Bitcoin supporters or really, really REALLY desperate people with absolutely no other alternatives would pay $3-5 for everyday transactions (settlements, traders, ransomware etc. will keep the number of transactions high enogh to keep the price from dropping).
One of the payment providers already charges the user an additional Bitcoin fee (in addition to the fee the user pays for their own tx) to pay for the transaction collecting the output generated by the user. That means that right now, I'd pay $2-3 just for buying a steam game, which is obviously unattractive if I can just pay with one of the other methods where I pay *zero* fees.
So crypto payment providers will likely soon look for alternatives. They can easily implement them, since the merchant typically gets fiat anyways. So I expect them to start offering e.g. Ethereum as an alternative very soon. This will make Bitcoin a lot less attractive for payments. It may keep its value as "digital gold" for hoarding, or it might become worthless. This, in turn, would destroy the miner's investment. This makes it likely that miners will try to avoid this situation, and likely not in a way that would deprive them of future fees (enabling SW and thus LN).

The crypto is secure, but that doesn't make the system as a whole secure. No one is going to break those keys (until quantum computers come around in a decade or two), unless the PRNG you used to create them is broken (which has happened), they're going to bypass this protection in other ways, eg. stealing the keys.
If whatever holds/uses your keys (eg. your phone, your computer, or if you have coins in an exchange the exchange) gets compromised, your coins are gone. Which has happened.
If you do use a Trezor or other hardware wallet, and the company making them gets compromised and a bad firmware update is pushed, you could again lose your coins. Which hasn't happened but is definitely possible unless you never update the wallet.
With banking, you can get hacked the same way. The difference is that you get your money back.

Overwhelming node connectivity, collaborating with miners, or *being* the miners, in ascending order of likelihood.
Collaboration with miners could be explicit, but doesn't have to be - a miner supporting full replace-by-fee would be sufficient, for example. And by the time we get quantum computers, the block reward will be rather small, incentivizing such behavior.
The quantum entity being a large miner is also not unlikely since I think a quantum computer could be used for extremely fast mining (which is another problem by itself - if I'm not mistaken, there's a good chance that the first entity to use a quantum computer for mining immediately becomes a 51+% miner despite all the ASICs).
These attacks are not assuming an adversary on the level of an intelligence agency. Those will just have quantum capabilities a few years before companies, would be my guess (and of course overwhelming node connectivity).

That's a horrible idea, but it's a *particularly* horrible idea if you're involved in Bitcoin.
Old versions can include security issues. Torrent clients are applications implementing complex network protocols, accepting and handling unauthenticated traffic from anyone. uTorrent is a closed-source application written in C++,  a non-memory safe language (this makes it easy to make catastrophic mistakes). The combination of these facts makes using outdated uTorrent versions a HORRIBLE idea unless you want to get compromised and any coins stolen which are handled on your computer, or phones that you connect to the computer with iTunes or adb.

You can't be robbed, but they can, and if they're unable to give you "your" coins, you're fucked... like many other people were when other exchanges got hacked.
Keeping money on exchanges is generally considered a horrible idea. I don't see it as black and white, since for most people, keeping the coins on a reputable exchange with 2FA (and taking the risk of the government going bad, the exchange going bad, the exchange getting hacked, or their account getting hacked) might be less risky than keeping the coins themselves (and taking the risk of losing the key or getting it stolen by malware).
I had coins on Bitstamp when it got hacked, and didn't lose any because they could eat the loss, but that could easily have been an expensive lesson.

Yes. For the consumer, it has more down- than upsides (assuming a consumer in a western country with access to regular banking):
* No consumer protection, transactions are irreversible
* Can be cheaper for foreign currency transactions (PayPal charges 2.5% over the mid-market rate), but consumer pays transaction and currency conversion fees (remember to also count fiat-&gt;bitcoin unless your employer directly pays you in Bitcoin)
* Some anonymity vs. goverment/payment companies, but possibly less anonymity towards the public (due to public Blockchain)
* You need to convert your fiat into Bitcoin beforehand and hold Bitcoin
* Consumer is responsible for the security of their funds
* Less convenient than a PayPal account with password saved in the password manager even if you already hold coins
* Depending on security used, comparable in convenience to credit cards if you already hold coins
Compare it with PayPal, especially for small payments. I'm assuming the user is already signed up with PayPal and a Bitcoin exchange (sign-up is easier with PayPal, AFAIK) and using the barely reasonable minimum of security (PayPal password in browser password manager, Bitcoins in Mycelium without PIN - Bitcoin suffers worse if we increase the security level):
* I click a PayPal button on the HumbleBundle checkout page where I want to buy the bundle for $10.
* I click the login button (password manager)
* I confirm
* Done. My account is not in USD, so I pay $10.25. PayPal takes the money from my bank account. If they take more than I agreed to - or really if I feel like it - I can tell my bank to return the money and PayPal will have to sue me. If my account were in USD, I'd pay $10 - less than with Bitcoin!
* If something goes wrong, PayPal consumer protection *may* help me or tell me to get screwed, but it provides some leverage in any case and tends to side with the buyer.
* I click the Bitcoin button
* I take out my phone
* I scan the QR code
* I confirm
* "Done". Ignoring volatility, I have paid ~$10.05 including the exchange fee and the tx fee, assuming noone tacked some currency fee on top of it. But now I also have to replenish my Bitcoin wallet manually at some point.
* If something goes wrong, I'm fucked - there is no consumer protection and I have zero leverage against the merchant.
Also compare with SEPA direct debit:
* I enter my address (this is usually offered by shops that ship physical goods, i.e. it's not really an extra step)
* I trigger the shortcut that pastes my IBAN
* Done. I've paid the exact amount with no fees.
* If something goes wrong, I can tell my bank within 8 weeks to reverse it, no questions asked (merchant has to sue me if they want their money).

IIRC that's what PayPal charges as a base fee for microtransactions. Bitcoin could become (I think) 2.5 ct more expensive before PayPal is cheaper for transactions of 50 cents. So for now, they're competitive from the fee standpoint. (Once you have to pay your developer $1000 for the integration just to receive a few hundred payments with it it becomes another story).
Of course, if you have to compare it to *PayPal* to argue that the fees are reasonable, there is something wrong anyways...

The main question is, are you a consumer or a merchant?
If you are a consumer, current payment mechanisms probably provide what you need with almost only advantages (e.g. credit cards/paypal for payments: some customer protection - you can reverse transactions if you get scammed, someone else pays the costs/fees, you don't really need to worry about security, transferwise for money transfers - often cheaper than exchanges).
Unless you find a compelling reason to use it, there is no reason why you should expose yourself to the effort, cost (exchange fees etc.) and risk (your coins can get stolen, become worthless, ...) associated with Bitcoin. Compelling reasons could be: you want to buy something from a merchant that only accepts Bitcoin, or you want an extra level of anonymity, or you want a speculative investment. I also find it useful since I can carry "large" amounts of money around relatively safely, but that's only useful if you can use this money (i.e. are around merchants or people who accept it).
If you are a merchant: You can't use Bitcoin exclusively since most people don't use it. Using it in addition will give you a small boost from fans who buy with Bitcoin just to support Bitcoin, but almost every person who has Bitcoin also has another means of payment (e.g. Paypal), so it's a lot of effort you spend for possibly little benefit.
The main issue if you actually handle Bitcoin: Better be an expert in IT security, or prepared to lose it all.

Many other blockchain-based projects sounded like someone just wanted to add another buzzword to be able to market the project better. They used it in situations where mutual digital signatures or timestamps from a trusted party (which these systems already required) would have worked just as well without all the complexity.

**EDIT:** For fucks sake, I meant it as a joke and they actually deleted it.

Your question doesn't make sense.
1. You can't withdraw BTC to a bank account. You can withdraw the value of the BTC to a bank account through an exchange or a provider that exchanges them.
2. Bitcoin is a distributed system and also a piece of software implementing it (also known as Bitcoin Core). Neither ask for bank accounts.
This means you're likely using some sort of exchange or service, but didn't mention which one, making it difficult to help you.
I'd expect the "alias" just being a name you choose to easily recognize the bank account within that application, so if you just have one bank account, you could just call it "my bank account" or something. But that's speculation since we don't know what you use.

That just means that it is new/rare software.


No way to confirm it without a massive effort. Also, since you didn't post a hash, you can't guarantee you're getting the same version that someone analyzed. It's also a HTTP download, allowing anyone in control of your Internet connection to replace it with malware.
Best you can reasonably do is feed it to VirusTotal, which considers both the [file]( and the [site]( clean. This will not really tell you if it is safe (e.g. the author could have added a custom backdoor that no scanner knows/detects yet), but it has a decent chance to detect mass malware and adware.
It also doesn't tell you whether it has security vulnerabilities that could be exploited to gain control of your computer.
You can never be sure with software. You could run it on a separate machine or inside a VM if you don't trust the author.
This is why IT security is hard. Security-conscious authors (including e.g. Bitcoin Core and AFAIK also it-that-should-not-be-named) provide not just source code but also [verifiable builds]( so that you can make sure the binary they offer is actually built from the source code. You still have to [trust your compiler/build system]( and the source code, which could contain [hidden malicious backdoors]( or [mistakes that completely compromise your security](

In theory, as long as they use the same standard, you can recover it. AFAIK both Multibit and Mycelium use BIP 32 + BIP 39 + BIP 44, making them compatible - but only for "account 1" in the case of Multibit, apparently, and there have been some [issues]( in the past.
The timestamp seems to be needed for "more efficient recovery", whatever that means. You'll probably have to wait a bit longer for the system to scan the blockchain to be able to use your coins, but it shouldn't be needed to get access. Other wallets won't even ask for it nor provide a way to input it.
Best way to test: Send a tiny amount to it and try it out e.g. with mycelium.

The transactions are handled off site, but the ATM obviously holds the key material to authorize these remote transactions. A simple attack would be connecting the ATM back to the Internet anonymously, then feeding it money to "buy" Bitcoins. This would need to happen before the owner notices that the ATM is gone and has the presence of mind to revoke the access.
Then drill it open and get your money back.
@_date: 2015-10-05 23:03:15


Wat? The transaction is still secured by the security mechanisms present in Bitcoin, namely digital signatures. You are not doing anything else when handing your tx to random nodes on the Internet, btw.


It's not a routed mesh network. It's a broadcast network. There is no "routing state". Every message goes to every neighbour that doesn't already have it, always.


Feel free to go even further back, into the 80's, where Usenet was able to function under even more adverse conditions.
Broadcast networks are bad if you just want to get a message from A to B, but if you need every node to have all the state anyways, such as with Bitcoin, they're perfect. And even in practice, with all the limitations that come with it, these work absolutely incredibly well.

Because at that point it becomes hard to argue against hard fork block size increases with claims that they're unsafe, which makes it hard to choke on-chain transactions, which makes it hard to get users to accept a second layer network that requires them to lock in significant amounts of money before they can use it.

The "trolls" say to this "hurr durr penis".
People who rationally point out things you may not agree with (whom you likely also call trolls) point out that the Bitcoin computer [has 50 GHash/s]( That means that ~100 Bitcoin computers equal one AntMiner S7.
Looking at this picture of a random farm:  that's 12 sections with 9x7 miners each, i.e. 756 miners - and that's just what is visible on the picture.
Thus, assuming a farm like that using AntMiner S7, you'd need to sell this Bitcoin computer to ~75000 people just to have the same mining power as one row in a mining farm. To compare, this subreddit has 176299 subscribers as of right now.
Now, of course, future versions of it might be better, but so will future versions of centralized miners.
I have to admit that I expected the numbers to be even worse, but this is still not "decentralization of mining".
Also, assuming these 75k people don't just buy the Bitcoin computer to 'show their support' or other stupid reasons, but to actually use them, they'll need to make transactions. Using the widely-published figure of 7 transactions per second, the Bitcoin network can hanlde 604800 tx/day, i.e. each of the 75k Bitcoin computers could do about 8 tx/per day on average at most.

Depends how linked the miners are. I suspect the ones that would continue to mine would be near sufficient connections (e.g. directly connected to surviving cables leading to other miners etc., dedicated runners carrying blocks back and forth to the nearest uplink, ...)
Given the variant with radio transmitters and relay stations, six blocks would probably still be enough. The problem would be getting your tx to the first radio station, the rest would be almost as fast as today.
A DVB-T transmitter can send data at 5-32 Mbit/s on a single frequency band. Current blocks could be transmitted within less than a second from hop to hop. You bet some people would find a way to repurpose the transmitter of those useless shopping channels to do something useful. You could likely receive the blocks using software-modded receivers, and assuming 2 MByte/second of useful data, that's enough to transmit 120 MByte of data in 10 minutes. An 8 MB block would take 4 seconds to travel from hop to hop. The free bandwidth could be use to relay transactions, repeat past blocks for people newly joining, and transfer Usenet news for everyone.
All you would need to follow the blockchain anywhere in the world would be a moddable DVB-T receiver. All you would need to post a transaction would be some way of getting it to the nearest TV tower (e.g. local HAM radio).

Individual people don't really matter, though, and I suspect that the war has driven most moderates into hiding/silently barfing into an elephant-sized bathtub in disgust. I suspect miners and exchanges would be on board, which is all that matters.
I think that people (especially on are mostly against Segwit solely because it's from Core which they see as an enemy that cannot be reasoned with, and because activating it first would make a true block size increase unlikely. Once the underlying issues are resolved, the people who are still able to think rationally will probably be willing to accept it. However, the longer the war drags on, the more people will become fiercly ideological, and working with them will be about as pleasant as trying to get ISIS to work with radical orthodox Jews.

I'm not familiar with how Trezor implements this, but usually you'd have exponential backoff enforced by the software that is running inside the hardware wallet and cannot be modified by an attacker. After the first time you mistype the PIN, you wait 1 second. After the second time, 2 seconds. Third time, 4 seconds. Doubling every time becomes painful very quickly. After the 11th time, you wait 1024 seconds. After the 21st time, over a million seconds (12 days). After the 31st time, if you haven't given up by then and the Trezor hasn't turned to dust, 34 years. Power fails after 30 years? Too bad, timer starts again.

Given that even core is relying on checkpoints for faster initial validation, maybe we can finally discuss downloading UTXO set snapshots associated with checkpoints instead of the whole chain.
If you want to verify that the published hash of the UTXO set is the right one you can still do it, but if you are willing to trust a signature from a bunch of people (e.g. the same people from whom you get the prebuilt binary that could be doing anything) your initial download is something like 2 GB with no complex computation.

- test if it matches the checksum (1 in 2^32 keys will)
- output or sweep it

The problem is that the approach of scaling via off-chain channels (while keeping on chain tx volume constrained) means that on-chain transactions will likely become much less accessible (via fees), and also Bitcoin will become more complicated to use (it's already bad enough as is).
Its not that payment channels are bad per se, they're just not a good approach for scaling Bitcoin while on-chain scaling is a viable alternative (which it is and easily will be for the next couple of years).
@_date: 2017-07-07 09:03:10
First, thank you for engaging in rational discourse instead of an insult contest.
This is an interesting argument and a valid concern.
However, I'm worried that the Lightning Network will lead to more centralization than on chain scaling. Since you need to lock money in a channel, few users will be willing to maintain multiple channels. This will lead to a network structure consisting of very large LN nodes acting as banks, and those will be just as easily regulated. Also, one such node failing would cause an insane amount of settlements, clogging the on-chain network. Since in LN you can be cheated if you don't settle within a certain timeframe, this would be catastrophic.
I think $20k nodes are an extreme example that was used in the sense "even that would be OK" which is now being used as a Boogie man. If you look at the Tor network, which is mostly volunteer run, and uses much more resources than Bitcoin, I think we can scale on-chain *a lot* before centralization becomes a serious concern.
Bandwidth is not a concern at all in many liberal countries - 1 Gbps is becoming the standard in some cities already, and remember that for massive on chain scaling, were not talking about today, we're talking about many years down the road.
20 MB should be easily doable with a regular PC on a decent non-fiber broadband connection, today. That would give us enough room to scale for many years of growth. By the time we've actually filled 20 MB, today's top of the line hardware will be available for slightly above scrap value on eBay, and there will be embedded raspberry pi like devices that are as powerful as a normal computer today.
But that's the long term. Right now, we need to solve how to scale right now. Even most weak nodes can easily handle 2, 4, probably even 8 MB on chain. Increasing the block size limit is the simplest, and thus safest, way to scale. Off-chain solutions make it much harder to transact, and thus reduce the chance that we ever get to the point where Bitcoin is popular enough to need the proverbial $20k nodes.
This is why I think that until we actually grow large enough for it to become a problem, we should simply scale on chain.

Phones are incredibly complex, so there is a lot of attack surface, which is why there are typically security updates at least once a month closing a ton on security issues. They are simply too complex to be secure.
If you have one of the phones that don't receive regular security updates (most Androids), stop right now and secure your coins if you have more than a tiny amount on it. Visiting a link could be all that's needed to hack your phone and steal your keys.
The main advantages of hardware wallets are that they are single-purpose devices with very small, well-defined interfaces. There is not much attack surface, making it extremely unlikely that an attacker will manage to run malware on the hardware wallet.
You still need to protect against loss, of course, because the hardware wallet can break. The easiest way is a seed written in plain text stored in several secure locations, protected with a strong passphrase that you remember to keep someone who finds it from stealing your coins.

OK, let me check if the key has a checksum. If not, you probably dropped a letter. If that's your only mistake, the number of possibilities is possible positions times possible letters, so something between 1000 and 10000. That may seem like a lot but it really really isn't, especially since the raw keys aren't hardened if I remember correctly.
The site you used produces 52 letter keys (starting with K or L) with 58 possibilities if I'm not mistaken 
That's ~3000 possibilities if you omitted a letter. Roughly the same if you have all letters but flipped the spelling one one or two of them. Would probably take a few seconds with a completely unoptimized program to test them all. 
It does include error checking so electrum will let you continue once you typed the right key.

It's nothing more than attempting to be hip by doing something (really, anything) with "modern technology". Prime example: all the stuff VISA spun up. All of it used blockchains for the purpose of using blockchains, not to actually solve a real problem better than "old" technology could.
Blockchains are a consensus mechanism. Blockchains with proof of work are a consensus mechanism for strongly distrusting actors, completely unnecessary in the banking world that can fall back on the legal system for enforcement. So PoW is out. What remains is a decentralized database that at some point will come to a stable state. You can probably use it to implement useful things, but at that point, you're back to technology that existed long ago with a new fancy name.
Regular database systems can likely provide similar properties without the risk of orphan blocks and thus with much better guarantees that make using it easier.
Also, there is no reason why blockchains being used by banks should excite Bitcoiners more than e.g. ECDSA or LevelDB being used by banks...
The genius part about Bitcoin is not the P2P network, the block chain, the proof of work, the ledger, the signatures, etc. - it's the combination.

The correct damage control is admit, admit admit - show that you *control* the situation. I'd argue that Bitstamp did it right and didn't lose much trust - for some, they might even have gained trust because of the honesy and professionalism with which they handled it.
A reasonable response would be: "We are investigating a security issue. It appears that a small amounts of funds was stolen. Since we limit the funds available in our hot wallet, and only a small part of that was stolen, we can confidently say that we will be able to cover the loss. Thus, your funds are not affected. We are taking the system down until we have completed an investigation, and will provide a new update at (now+48hours). "
1. Admit that there is a problem as soon as it has been confirmed.
2. Explain that users won't be affected by it, *and give them the information they need to understand why* so they can trust the claim.
3. Promise to keep the crowd updated, and give a time for the next update. Don't forget to follow through, even if the update is "we cannot disclose the technical details of the attack to avoid tipping off the attacker, and expect to need several weeks to clean this up".

I appreciate the guide, but it doesn't really address the important part - how to run bitcoind on a server in a way that it will be automatically updated, runs with a separate user account for security, comes back up after a reboot, doesn't flood you disk with logs (logrotate), automatically renews the registration (it expires after 30 days) etc.
Except for the last part, it should be "apt-get install bitcoind". Possibly with a PPA add before that. The fact that it isn't means that the bitcoind devs are doing a very shoddy job.
The segfaults are even more disturbing. I don't know what causes them. I suspect some files get corrupted when the process gets killed, and it can't deal with that. That's a WTF I didn't expect, because I thought the bitcoind code to be of very good quality.

Digital signatures. It's impossible to spend your money without your signature. Transactions will be slow, and double-spending will be much more feasible, making zero-confirmation transactions impossible. Cash will definitely be what's used locally, but Bitcoin allows you to send money remotely, which isn't possible with cash.


That's exactly how a *broadcast* network works. You accurately described a regular mesh network.


No, it would not. Bitcoin is already based on every (full) node receiving all transactions and blocks. It already *is* a broadcast network, it just uses TCP over the Internet instead of local connections. You still only connect to ~50 nodes, send your TX to all of them, they forward it to everyone, etc. and this way it also reaches the miners. Thanks to the Internet, propagation times are measured in seconds, not hours, but the principle is the same. You probably wouldn't even need to adjust the protocol a lot to run Bitcoin over local connections!
You would only receive each transaction and each block once, just like with the current protocol, so it would be perfectly feasible. At 1 MB for the block and maybe another 1-2 MB for the mempool transactions per 10 minutes, node-to-node bandwidth wouldn't be that much of a problem. If you were offline for 24 hours, that means 156 MB worth of blocks, plus orphans, so let's say 300 MB an blocks plus 200 MB an transactions (probably less, since you don't need transactions that have been included in a block) *in total*. You wouldn't need to fetch 500 MB from each node you see - you could get a few blocks from one node, a few from another etc. That also means that every node would, on average, be required to provide 500 MB of actual data per day in total. On top of that, you get protocol overhead, but that is also manageable. The last 1000 blocks can be represented by 32 KB of block hashes, and a mempool containing 100,000 transactions by 3.2 MB of transaction IDs.
That is very, very feasible. In practice. On fucking *cell phones*. The biggest practical constraint for putting this on phones would probably be a battery and storage, which is easily solved with an SD card (or generous internal memory and only storing the UTXO set instead of the full blockchain) and an external battery pack (or using laptops).


Similar, but AFAIK Usenet was basically the next-gen BBS, but it still used periodic dial-ins for some of the links.
But yes, it would suck. *Everything* would suck. But of all the things, Bitcoin would be less affected than other things. Anything web-based would be completely, utterly, unfixably fucked, becasue the only way you could get that to run would be an actual mesh network, with routing and live connections.


You're thinking routed networks again, and routing messages where a node generates a unique message that is then broadcast through the network. The only information that is broadcast in Bitcoin is the actual transactions and blocks. There are no route requests. You just ask your neighbors "I have these blocks/transactions", your neighbor does the same, then you send the difference to each other. You never tell your neighbor "forward this block to X", you just give them the block. They'll give it to everyone, which means it will reach X just as well as if you found the optimal route (assuming that connections between nodes are the limiting factor, not bandwith, which is reasonable as I explained above).

Thanks, that sounds like a very useful improvement. I have well over 1 GB available, but I suspect that the attack transactions are way bigger than normal ones, which means that the default turns out to be much more than the 25 blocks worth of tx it's supposed to be. Won't this be a problem for the random selection if spammers choose to make big transactions (not chains of small transactions that depend on each other), since the random selection will be much less likely to hit the few big tx instead of legit small transactions?


Not sure if I understand you correctly here, but I don't think dumping a mempool full of spam transactions onto the blockchain is a good way of getting rid of it. I don't have a good alternative solution though.

That would basically be double-spending or attacks that delay your transactions, but not stealing your money.






Some of them still apply (e.g. much slower distribution), other problems only occur in routing-based mesh networks, not in "dumb" broadcast networks which would be the way to implement Bitcoin.


The TCP connection is of course unicast. However, the peer-to-peer network that Bitcoin builds on top of the Internet, the overlay, is a *broadcast network*. Note that this doesn't mean that every message is sent to every node, just that the actually interesting information ends up at every node. For example, the information "I, node 5, have block X" is only sent to immediate neighbors, it is not routed further. However, once the neighbors have the block, they will in turn announce that they have it. This way, the blocks itself do reach every node in the network. It's also known as a Gossip Protocol, Epidemic Routing etc.
Currently, the overlay network of Bitcoin uses TCP over the Internet for the connections from one node to another. These would be replaced by e.g. WiFi links in a no-Internet scenario. The rest of the protocol would stay more or less the same.
Note that I'm not talking about picking 50 nodes at random, building routed connections via a mesh network to them, and then sending them the blocks. That would be dumb and would not work. You only do the standard Bitcoin protocol exchange with nodes that you can *directly* reach via a direct WiFi/Bluetooth/whatever link.


This limit would apply to the immediate range only. Imagine four nodes: A, B, C, D.
     A        B                     C        D
B and C are 500 meters from each other, A/B and C/D stand next to each other. The WiFi range of those phones is 50m.
A sends a signed transaction t^(A). The signed transaction reaches B immediately. D sends a signed transaction t^(D), and it reaches C immediately. Both transactions can be sent at the same time without interfering with each other.
B walks to the right. The connection to A drops. B walks further to the right. B and C get in range. Their phones connect and notice that C is missing t^A and B is missing t^D - so they exchange them, one after the other. C also still has a connection to D, so he forwards t^A to D. He doesn't actively *route*, he just notices that one of his *direct* neighbors is missing one of the transactions he has, so he gives it to him. B neither knows nor cares about this connection.
B now has both transactions and walks south, where he meets a new node, E. E sees that B has two transactions E doesn't know, and downloads both. B misjudges his steps and falls into a volcano. E walks around and meets A. A notices that E has one one transaction that A is missing, and downloads t^D. All nodes now have both transactions without any kind of routing information being exchanged or any routes being pre-arranged.
This is what I'm talking about.


The initial sync would suck a bit, but not too much, *assuming you're able to meet one node that has the full chain* (or the full chain minus a few recent blocks) - you'd just download the entire chain from that node, either over your direct link, or, because that would be really slow, by walking up to the guy and asking him to copy it onto a thumb drive for you.
However, assuming your neighbor in an appartment building has an up-to-date full node, the blockchain could be reasonably downloaded in one night: assuming you manage to put 3 MB/s net bandwidth on the WiFi, 8 hours/night * 3600 seconds/hour * 3 MB/s = 86 GB/night.


The limiting factor is often CPU, not bandwidth. As you saw above, downloading the blockchain at 3 MB/s takes less than 8 hours. You could first collect the blockchain while only doing SPV-like checking, then verify the blockchain at home using a PC.


Sure, if you have 100 nodes spread over a large area so that they never meet, everything is fucked. But as the network gets better, Bitcoin will become feasible *long* before other services.


I did run one with a broadcast/gossip approach, that's why I speak with confidence (sorry, I won't share details since I don't like my real life identity linked to a reddit account). It works *much* better than I expected. You do need a certain node density, but since it's ok if nodes meet only occasionally (you don't need a chain of hops), it's less than one would expect.


No, sounds interesting.


The main problem with traditional web surfing is that it doesn't tolerate delays well. If your transaction takes 5 minutes to reach a miner, meh. If your HTTP request takes 5 minutes to generate a response, and another 5 minutes to fetch the CSS, and another 5 minutes to fetch the icons mentioned in that CSS...


I think you're again assuming that in such a scenario:
    A               F
     \             /
      B --- D --- E
     /             \
    C               G
F would be downloading the blockchain from A, possibly even hitting G with useless noise. What would happen, assuming A and C are the only nodes who have the blockchain, would be B downloading half the blockchain from A and half the blockchain from C, D downloading the entire blockchain from B, E downloading the entire blockchain from D, F and G each downloading the entire blockchain from E. A would only ever see B and his packets - the communication packets between e.g. D and E would **not** be broadcast. It's only called a broadcast network because the *payload* of the network (tx/blocks) ends up on all nodes.
You can add as many nodes as you want, as long as the block size and number of transactions stays the same, the *per-node* traffic remains *constant* (it is linear with the total size of the blocks/transactions but NOT the number of nodes!), aside from protocol overhead for "hi, do you have any new blocks" which grows according to the number of nodes you meet (not the total size of the network).


A link-local beacon (physical broadcast) that never leaves the vincinity of your node.


But you don't want to communicate with X. You just want all blocks, and all transactions. You don't care where you get them from. You don't even care if X is anywhere.


At a total bandwidth requirement of a few MB every 10 minutes per node in the immediate vincinity, the spectrum will not be that full. Assuming 5 MB per 10 minutes and 100 nodes within range of each other, that's less than 1 MB/s of spectrum that you need. Perfectly doable with WiFi even without tricks like using link-local broadcast so you only have to transmit each block once and all nodes in range get it.

That is exactly what I expect to happen if the fork is very small yet still annoying for some reason. If the total hash power of the fork is just a small percentage of total hash power, let's say 2%, a single big miner (e.g. one with 20%) can sacrifice e.g. 20% of their hash power (so 4% of total hash power) to kill the fork and keep Bitcoin united.
Preventing messy/contentious forks can raise the value of Bitcoin, making it worthwhile.
A scenario like with Ethereum (where the ETC fork is happily living on) is possible, but an attack is much more likely than with Ethereum because Ethereum mining is much more decentralized.
One caveat is that the attack can also come much later. Assuming the above percentages, the miner could mine normally for two weeks (giving the fork a head start), then change their mind, spend 20% of their hash power for two weeks to catch up, then publish the new chain and roll back a month of transactions on the fork. Or only catch up for a week and only roll back two weeks. Or simply start preventing any movements from that point on, again making the coins worthless.
In particular the middle option (roll back some but not all) would totally fuck over exchanges. Imagine an exchange that got 1000 ForkCoins deposited into it over the time, those have been bought and sold many times, now 500 of the deposit transactions have been rolled back...
Just this theoretical risk - even if no attack actually happens! - is probably enough for many exchanges to refuse dealing with it.

Not true. As soon as you attempt to use an address, your key is exposed and can be broken using quantum computing. After that, the cryptographic protections are gone. An attacker with privileged network access may isolate your node, intercept your tx before it reaches the network, then break your key and broadcast his tx. Even if you do manage to get your tx out first, it's up to the miner mining the next block whether they honor your tx or the attacker's (assuming the attacker can break it before the block is mined, which is a reasonable assumtion). The attacker can influence that decision by offering a significantly higher reward.

Then Core better provide the HF code. It's not as if it's hard to write (or rather, *merge* at this point). I totally get why miners do this. 
Once the devs have their toys and Blockstream has what they need, there is little motivation for either to allow the HF part of the roundtable consensus to happen. The unwillingness of some major Core members to allow a HF is well documented. It is reasonable for the miners to assume that Core will further stall or outright refuse to provide the HF code.

The latter. What's important is that you don't need a real mesh. If A wants to send a tx so that B sees it, A can meet X, X can meet Y, and Y can meet B, separately. In a mesh, you'd need A to be within range of X while X is in range of Y while Y is in range of B, figure out that this link exists, and send the message. This doesn't work well. In a broadcast net, anyone you meet relays your message to anyone they merecipient that, even if you are already out of range. This works *incredibly* well.
Think about it. You're sitting at home and send a TX. *Anyone* who walks past your house (and has the app) picks it up.
As long as *one* of them gets on a bus, everyone on the bus gets your TX. Anyone waiting at a station where the bus stops gets it. Anyone on any bus that stops at any if these stations gets it. Anyone who uses public transport, gets near public transport, or gets near anyone who used public transport gets it. As long as one of these people gets to the airport, anyone in the airport gets your TX. Anyone in an airport where a plane from that airport lands gets the TX. Anyone on the public transport network connected to the airport gets your TX. The gas station attendant gets the TX. Anyone stopping at the gas station gets the TX. Anyone who comes near any of these people gets the TX. Anyone who comes near any of *these* people gets the TX. Everyone gets the TX, and you'd be surprised how quickly it happens.
Don't expect instant confirmations. Mining would be a HUGE problem since block propagation is slow (miners would probably establish dedicated lines to each other using whatever is available, thus helping spread the messages worldwide).
Bitmessage and Usenet don't suffer from mining/block propagation, since they don't need a ledger. You certainly couldn't chat live, but your messages would probably still reach your recipient faster than by postal mail, even internationally. AFAIK, Usenet was there long before the Internet was a thing.
And this is assuming no Internet or long-range comms at all, just powerful phones/average laptops and short range WiFi links.
You could also broadcast transactions and blocks via radio transmitters and relay stations, which would probably be enough to quickly get worldwide distribution within half a minute or so.

Of course anyone is free to cause a contentious fork at any time. However, assuming that everyone is willing to cooperate insofar that they actually do what they signal in order to avoid a contentious fork:
* If nodes supporting segwit-only-with-hardfork were to signal both 4 and 1 (with the ratios as above), segwit-only would activate and the hardfork would not
* If these nodes were to signal only 4, nothing would activate (unless the ratios changed)
The latter outcome is preferable to people who want segwit-only-with-hardfork (if it weren't, they could just signal 1 and skip the entire consensus agreement). Thus, signalling both 4 and 1 would be against their interests. Thus, it does not make sense to expect them to do that. It makes sense to *wish* they did that if you prefer the first outcome, but it doesn't make sense to actually expect it.
Of course, segwit supporters could simply signal 4 without actually supporting the hardfork part. This would then trigger n contentious hardfork, since everyone who implements the meaning of bit 4 as it was designed would still fork.


Please don't try to make communication difficult by pretending that you don't know what I mean.


[citation needed]. It also doesn't make a lot of sense. Why should people who don't want a hardfork support it once everything they want (segwit) is activated? And more importantly, why would you expect the "big block" side to go first and hope that the other side will suddenly feel like supporting a hard fork? This does not make sense if you assume rational actors on at least one of the sides, and there is way too much (well justified) distrust to expect this to work on the basis of some kind of "gentlemen's agreement".

The fact that transactions are irreversible is another upside for sellers, as is the quick settlement.
In the long run, any seller that doesn't offer at least 5% off for Bitcoin is basically overcharging. In the short run, it can be justified because sellers need to expend time and money to integrate Bitcoin. Since many Bitcoiners want to pay with Bitcoin not because it's better for them, but to show support for Bitcoin, this works, and it benefits adoption.

First, several people who also build the binaries (minus luke-jr because his modem can't handle the download) and who'd sign the hash.
Second, anyone who feels like checking and has the resources, *you included* if you feel like it.
You could also start running your node immediately while verifying in parallel. You'd have limited confidence until the verification finished, and full confidence after that. While the signers could deceive you for a couple of days, this would come at a cost of getting caught later and you'd have digitally signed proof that *all* the developers colluded to do something bad. An unacceptable risk if you're running an exchange live. Likely an acceptable risk if you're a merchant selling goods that can't be easily resold for cash. Acceptable if you're starting an exchange, testing your systems for a couple of weeks, and only going live after you've verified.
I think checking a specific chain could be done in a much more efficient manner than what the client normally does, since you don't have to worry about reorgs or gracefully handling invalid blocks. You know that if this chain is valid it is part of the longest one, and the chain being invalid would be an exceptional situation that would need to be handled manually anyways, so you can probably parallelize the checks:
Block by block, write all outputs any transaction generates and the position (block and number of transaction within the block). This is "embarrassingly parallel", i.e. trivially parallelizable since you work block by block.
Write all inputs any transaction consumes, and the position where that happens. This is embarrassingly parallel.
Verify the parts that you can verify block by block (Merkle tree, proof of work ...) in parallel. Store what you can't verify without knowing previous outputs (fees?). This is embarrassingly parallel.
Match outputs to transactions spending them. One random read per input, so you probably want to have the data on a single machine on SSD for simplicity, but if you had to parallelize, you could trivially shard the data by txid. This step is computationally trivial (won't put much load on your CPU) but will still take a lot of time since you need to fetch the transactions. With a single consumer grade SSD you would only be handling a couple thousand transactions per second. There are probably faster/smarter ways to implement this though.
Using the matched transactions, verify that the transaction is correctly spending the outputs. This is embarrassingly parallel - you can check each *transaction* independently at this point, in any order. Check that outputs are not consumed before they were generated using the positions collected previously. Calculate fee outputs for each tx and write (block, fees) somewhere. This involves signature checking, hashing, and script execution. The majority of your CPU time will be spent here. This will likely be another bottleneck if you have a single weak machine.
Sum up the fees for each block by reading the list of (block, fees) outputs. Can be parallelized if you are running this on multiple nodes or you are not IO-bound - classic distributed sum problem.
Check the header hash chain, the fees, etc. for each block. Could probably be parallelized but might not be worth bothering.
Finally, take the unspent outputs, sort them, build the utxo set, and hash it (Merkle tree so it's parallelizable).
Why am I mentioning parallelization so much? Because it means both that you can split the work across multiple machines if one is too slow, allowing you to scale indefinitely as long as you have the hardware, and that on a single machine, you can do this efficiently by doing single-pass reads and writes, storing all data on HDDs instead of SSDs, and only needing enough RAM for a single work unit (here a block at worst).

You need to signal it, and if &gt;95% signal it will be activated, so it will be activated.
The "need to signal" is basically a way to force-activate it in a backwards compatible way.
Of course, miners could choose to activate it and then not enforce the rules. Segwit compatible clients  and  miners would then reject their blocks. If a minority of miners ignored the rules, their blocks would simply get orphaned. If a majority would ignore the rules, a very messy fork that is not in any miner's interest would result.
Despite all the FUD, the most likely thing to happen is:
* Blocks not signalling Segwit get orphaned once Segwit2x activates (edit: less than one day from the date of this post actually)
* As a result, 100% of blocks signal segwit
* Segwit activates
* In about 3 months, 2 MB blocks become valid. A 1 MB fork will form but likely not be very meaningful and possibly will be 51%-attacked.

No. They consist of signed transactions in their canonical form. If the transactions could represented in another way, we'd have a malleability attack.
Of course it might be possible to gain a few bytes by compressing the block, but the existing clients don't support that. Thus, even if you found a good way to compress them, you couldn't enable it without requiring basically the same change that you'd also require to raise the block size to 2 or 8 MB...

I suspect that you might be able to recover them from the phone, depending on how secure it is and how much money you want to invest.
For almost $3k, even the more expensive recovery techniques could be worth it. I'd power off that phone to reduce the chance of the data being overwritten. If it is a version that you can root from the running system, without having to wipe it, you could root it, acquire a block-by-block copy of the block device using "dd", and then hope that you'll be able to recover anything from it.
If you have a somewhat recent version though, chances are good that you won't be able to root it and/or the data is securely wiped, and thus your coins are lost.
Did you explicitly, manually uninstall the old version before installing the new one? Because that's about the only way I can see this happening.

For security in practice, there is a huge difference between 0 confirmations and one confirmation, and it is much less than the difference between one confirmation and 100 confirmations.
With Bitcoin, you get the first confirmation within an average of 10-20 minutes depending on how much you pay,  you get almost no security until you got that first confirmation, and there is a lot of variance.
With Eth, you get a weak confirmation almost instantly, and thanks to the number of blocks, the variance for both "first inclusion" and "about 10 min of hashpower on top of it" is much smaller.

The known attacks handle cases where the HDD with the infected firmware is the boot device. It presents the system with a different MBR/boot sector, and can use this to load a bootkit into memory before running the regular boot process. Thus, the TrueCrypt password prompt runs in a thin hypervisor, with a keylogger sitting outside and stealing it.
Also, HDDs have direct memory access. I don't know the details of that - it could be restricted to an address space reserved for that, but I doubt it (given that even Firewire had full access, and it would require another copy operation after a read if the drive couldn't directly dump the data whereever). Thus, the HDD should be able to infect the running system (by injecting a malicious binary) *even if you never execute anything off it*!

So you think exchanges and payment processors will not consider the result of the miner consensus "Bitcoin", switching or patching nodes as needed? Even though many of them explicitly declared support for the New York Agreement, and others have said that they will follow the chain with the most work? If so, do you have any indicators that this will be the case, e.g. declarations of intent by major exchanges or payment providers?
Or do you think that because "the users", whoever that may be but not including exchanges and payment providers, run Core, they will have economic significance even though the big players follow the Segwit2x fork?

Or they can declare the 2x chain to be Bitcoin, and if there actually was significant economic following of the other chain, kill off that chain that refuses to follow consensus with a 51% attack.
At that point, smallblockers have two options - respect the consensus, or create an altcoin by changing the PoW algorithm, but there is no way you can securely maintain a 1 MB fork against an overwhelming consensus. Even if such a fork was not 51%-ed initially, it would be much less secure (and subject to attacks at a later point).
Due to the risk of 51% attacks, I also doubt exchanges, especially large ones, will be willing to touch a minority fork with a ten foot pole.

He's assuming that a majority is doing it. If that is the case, the minority will be orphaned.
Unless miners want to risk mining on a chain that will likely be orphaned (risking over $30k per block), they'll enforce it.
Of course there could be a hypothetical cabal that decided to intentionally signal incorrectly and create a huge mess, but that would be a conspiracy theory not backed by any evidence, and unlikely since creating a mess in the Bitcoin ecosystem is the last thing miners want.
Given that miners don't know whether a majority will enforce it but &gt;80% of hash rate claim they will, it is reasonable to assume that there is a large chance that it will be enforced. This makes it a smart choice to enforce. This fact, in turn makes it more likely that it will be enforced. That, in turn... self-fulfilling prophecy.

You have to lock coins into a channel for it to be useful. This means users will want to maintain as few channels as possible, and use them bidirectionally. This means they'll likely maintain a channel with a major exchange, most merchants will maintain a channel with their exchange (for the same reason), and most transactions will thus be User - user's exchange - merchant's exchange - merchant (unless user and merchant share an exchange).
Doesn't have to be an actual Bitcoin exchange, could be a major lightning hub of some other sort.

I am still running mine, but barely and with a lot of downtimes. It's too needy (attention-wise, not resources). One of the TX DDoS attacks made it run out of RAM, and instead of shutting down gracefully, it chose to corrupt the block index. Required manual intervention and a week while it verifies the database. There are no ARM packages, meaning I have to recompile it to update it. If it crashes for whatever reason, it stays down. Maybe this has been fixed now for non-ARM architectures, but the packages didn't include init scripts, meaning a reboot killed the node.
Without bitnodes monitoring, the node would be more down than up.
Actionable items:
* don't fuck up the block index, ever
* if you do, don't fuck up all of it (i. e. remember which parts are known-good and don't touch those)
* provide packages (ideally via official Ubuntu repos) that help set up monitoring and deal with failures and reboots well (init scripts, restart, notify on failure)

If we had 8 MB blocks, storage requirement goes up to 500 GB per year of blockchain, and you'll probably want more RAM and CPU. I'd still expect you to be able to find something capable of running a node for like EUR 20/month, maybe even 10.

It is a software implementation that will enforce Segwit in a similar manner as the UASF would (i.e. requiring BIP141 signalling), but ONLY if a future block size increase is locked in. A Segwit2x lock-in means Segwit lock-in/activation will be forced AND block size will increase in 3 months.
The software that implements it is btc1 
Just locking in Segwit would not be sufficient because there would be no decision to increase the block size. That did not get supermajority support. Hence the compromise of activating Segwit and 2 MB blocks together via bit 4.

1. Lack of regulation, meaning there is no need to have such insurance, much easier to just go bankrupt if you get hacked.
2. Lack of providers willing to provide such an insurance, I'd suspect.
3. For larger exchanges, maybe even the impossibility of such insurance. Assuming an exchange holds 11 million BTC, gets hacked, and the hacker burns the coins. *No insurance can replace these coins, since there are less coins left in circulation than were stolen*. Of course, an exchange does not have to be this big for this to become a practical problem (i.e. the insurance not having/not being able to obtain enough coins to cover the losses). This assumes the insurance pays out in BTC, not USD. If they pay USD, at what value/exchange rate? The one after the hack can be massively different from the pre-hack one (e.g. if the hacker burns the coins, the price might go up massively, if he sells them, the price would go down). I doubt any insurance is willing to insure such an unpredictable risk, much easier to bet on natural disasters...

It seems like the problem you're trying to solve is electronic to fiat. Bitcoin *might* give you access to a better way of solving the problem, but Bitcoin itself does not solve it. (This also means that comparing Bitcoin fees to WU fees is extremely misleading.)
Whether Bitcoin helps you or not depends mainly on whether there are Bitcoin -&gt; Fiat agents in your location. Due to the decentralized nature of Bitcoin, it is easier to become such an agent (no registration requried etc.), so this is an upside that Bitcoin can rightfully claim to have created. More agents also mean more competition, i.e. once Bitcoin is thrieving in a location, prices will likely be lower than with centralized solutions.
Bitcoin also cuts out a lot of the bureaucracy because the agents often simply ignoring requirements to follow regulations. Whether that's a good or bad thing is open to debate, but I'd be careful parading that around since it's basically saying "it's easier because we simply break the law".

In the end, Coinbase still gave his money to someone else, and now it can become a *very* interesting game of liability lawsuits between Coinbase, the provider, and the victim.
If I have money in a bank, and someone walks in with a fake passport and the bank gives them my money, I believe that in the end the bank will be liable (may depend on jurisdiction).
If I were OP, my lawyer would be talking to the lawyers of Coinbase and the Telco that enabled this. Coinbase has [reimbursed victims of phishing in the past]( - and in the case of phishing attacks, you can certainly claim that it was the victim's fault a lot easier than when the victim just used the exchange *and their additional, recommended security measures*.

The snippet you posted is Python code. Or rather, it was before Reddit removed the newlines and spaces. Add four spaces to each line (only within Reddit) to keep it intact:
    import hashlib
    def xor_func(s1,s2):
       return ''.join(chr(ord(a) ^ ord(b)) for a,b in zip(s1,s2))
    def verify(txid,secret,lessthan):
       sha512 = hashlib.sha512()
       sha512.update(xor_func(secret,txid))
       b = long(sha512.hexdigest(),16)
       result = b % 65537
       if result&lt;lessthan:
          print "win!"
       else:
          print "lose!"
			
This defines a function called "verify" which expects the txid, the secret, and the value that you are betting against (I.e. need to go under).
Call it like this:
    verify('txidgoeshere', 'secretgoeshere', 1000)
And it will tell you whether you won. To run it, put their code in a text file, add the verify line at the end, save the file, install Python, open a shell/command line and call Python with the file name. Or find an online Python interpreter and drop it in there.

I was more thinking about robbing the public domain by bribing politicians to extend copyright - an artificial monopoly granted to them, not a natural-born right! - practically indefinitely, treating legitimate consumers like criminals, using malware to enforce their "rights", creating a persecution industry that practically eradicated free open WiFi in Germany, ...
They also do some hypocritical stuff like pretending that content is property when it's convenient, but then not wanting to treat it as such when they feel like it (See e.g.: You are allowed to take your property apart, but you aren't allowed to break DRM. Various attempts to illegalize or otherwise hinder legal grey market imports. The US textbook racket.)
That explains the "why I consider the content industry evil" part. Now, to the "why I consider piracy as contributing to society" part:
Instead of making content reasonably available legally, the content industry is extremely anti-consumer. Piracy both limits the extent to which the content industry can go before everyone says "fuck you" and pirates, and mitigates the effects of what the content industry does. Examples would be DRM preventing me from playing legitimately bought BluRay disks, delays and restrictions on international availability, DRM bullshit that forces people to install software which opens gaping security holes (hello Silverlight).
Of course, when I started pirating, it was because I couldn't or didn't want to afford the money. My financial situation has changed drastically, and now I'm pirating because it's the only safe, reliable and convenient way to consume content. If you disagree: Assume that I have decided on a Saturday evening that I will watch The Bedford Incident on Sunday in Switzerland. I own a powerful laptop with Linux. Please provide me with a legal way to do so. If you can't, or if it involves FedExing a BluRay around the world or otherwise costs more than any reasonable person would pay for it, piracy is providing a net benefit to society by making content available.
Want another scenario? I'm going on a short flight (no Internet). In-flight entertainment is showing crap. I will have the same laptop with me. I would like to watch one of the top 10 movies from 2015. Can you provide a legal way to do so?
Or let's add a long layover in an airport in bumfuck nowhere (no Internet again), but let's make it easier, I'll take a Mac or Windows machine. This time, I'll need all top 10 movies. I'll watch a few of them on the flight there, a few on the flight back. How many depends on how tired I am, and I'm not paying twice for any of them. I'm willing to install up to two pieces of software but it better be full HD. Possible now?
If the answer to the above is "I don't have the time to look that up for you", my answer is "Me neither. But I know that the torrent will work. And it will work on all of my devices. And it will not require some DRM dance."
Guess what, since buying music online actually became possible (read: You get clean MP3s that fucking work), I actually bought some music. I haven't bought movies yet.
I do agree with your remaining assesment of Kimble, and I hope for a long and fruitful fight with the content industry. No matter who gets hurt more, the rest of the world wins, and maybe some free movies will drop from the dust too.

That way, they can still claim they didn't break the agreement...

But one of them will have about 10 blocks per week for the next 4 years unless mining power magically appears on that fork.
Oh, and no segwit either because it times out even on the fork before it can lock in... There has to be a full difficulty adjustment period of 2016 blocks before it can activate.
At 1% of the current hashing power, that won't happen before segwit times out, and IIRC the UASF fork has even less support than that.
@_date: 2017-06-18 16:48:14
All blocks mined after August 1 will signal segwit. Segwit will lock in once a full difficulty adjustment period (2016 blocks) has had 95% of segwit blocks. So it could be slightly less than 2000 blocks, or almost 4000 blocks, depending how far into a difficulty period we are and how many have signalled segwit before that date.
If the lock-in doesn't happen until Nov 15, segwit will not activate despite the signalling. Normally this wouldn't be a problem, since mining the required 2000-4000 blocks takes 2-4 weeks. However, if the fork has insufficient hash power, it might not mine enough blocks until Nov 15, and the activation might fail. I think the threshold where it is guaranteed to fail is something like 11%.
Also, miners can't spend the block reward for 100 blocks, so if the UASF chain is slow, they might be waiting for their rewards for a while, and if someone 51% attacks the chain to disrupt it (not unlikely if they feel like UASF is endangering their source of income), the attacker can release 100 blocks once legit miners have reached 98, denying them their rewards without significantly contributing to the total blocks mined on that chain (and thus the chance to activate segwit), since the 98 legit blocks would be orphaned.
Attempting to fork as a minority in order to force your preferences onto the entire network is risky. 
@_date: 2017-06-18 17:05:53
Unless the majority agrees on supporting Segwit by Aug 1, which I still consider doubtful, if UASF manages to mine a single block, there will be a chain split.
The new chain might be rather worthless, or not if supporters dump their BTC and buy UASFcoin to push the price up, but there will be a split.

And that's only for actual recovery, brute-force can of course recover from even more damage.
Also, assume that any image transform short of completely replacing the area with a solid color can leak information, especially blurring or that swirl filter.
Not a problem in this case since only a very small part of the code is visible, but keep it in mind when you decide to show off things that bear private keys.

Fail. Try again.
The difficulty will adjust after a *difficulty adjustment period*. That's where the name comes from... segwit just reuses it as a convenient point for activation. And that time is measured in blocks, not calendar days - with full hash power, the required number of blocks is typically reached in 14 days. With 10% hash power, difficulty will not adjust until 140 days have passed. By the time difficulty adjusts, segwit will likely have either timed out or activated.
The difficulty will also not adjust fully within one period, since the max adjustment is capped.

About 20-30% of mining power (not nodes) might be enough to force it onto the rest.
It currently has about 1 or even less than that, although supporters will be quick to point out that it is surely more in reality and those miners are just hiding for now...
@_date: 2017-06-12 01:24:09
People will come up with explanations why it allegedly does, like not provoking "resistance" from the other side, basically a "surprise attack".
OTOH, showing a lot of support is the best way to get more support, *if you already have significant support beyond an army of very vocal sockpuppets*... it's also useful to reveal reasonably early if you think you can actually get enough support, in order to avoid a messy contentious fork that will devalue both sides of the chain. But for that, a week or two would probably be enough *assuming that there actually was a significant fraction of mining power supporting UASF*.
For an economic majority to pressure a united front of miners, the economic majority would have to be absolutely overwhelming, and there is absolutely no sign of that.
Edit: Either way, as long as there is *one* node that wants to do a UASF, the fork is happening, technically. However, it also means that the participating nodes fork themselves off the main chain. So, unless participants are sure that the fork is going to succeed, they're taking a big risk (assuming they actually have skin in the game, which many of the vocal supporters likely don't). This is a good reason why rational supporters would likely be interested in knowing how many others actually support it, i.e. how likely it is that the fork will meaningfully succeed. Which, again, would speak for revealing early. The main reason for "hiding" is IMHO trying to claim an invisible army of supporters that doesn't exist.

And it needs at least ca. 2016 blocks (normally 2 weeks) before the November 15 deadline to activate segwit, so at least 400 blocks per month, so at least something like 9% of the current hash power.
@_date: 2017-06-18 21:45:46
Depends on what you mean by "fork occurs". As I said, as soon as a single block is mined, a fork has technically occurred, even if that fork is meaningless.
If a BIP148 fork forms with a minority of mining power &lt;20%, I can't see exchanges listing it as BTC. That title will stay with the unmodified chain if it meaningfully exists. If BIP148 gets over 50% of mining power, there will be no remaining legacy chain since it's a softfork.
Accepting deposits of a BIP148 coin with mining power &lt;20% of global hashpower would be extremely risky due to the threat of 51% attacks by miners opposing UASF.
Now, if we have *two* forks (UASFcoin and Bitmain's 2MB-12-hours-later fork), all bets are off.

Segwit with no further on chain scaling is very different from segwit with a reasonable outlook that on chain scaling will actually happen.
Note that the original HK agreement already contained pretty much exactly what was now decided as segwit2x, minus technical enforcement, but the "2x" part of it was sabotaged.
One reason for the strong opposition to segwit-only was that there would be a strong incentive for off-chain system peddlers to sabotage further on chain scaling once they had what they needed. With real on chain scaling happening within 3-4 months, this is less of a concern. The problem isn't so much segwit (although it is an ugly hack introducing way too much complexity), but the "not scaling" that may result from activating it. (Lightning network, OTOH, is just dangerous nonsense that would cause centralization and then fail horribly when one such centralized node blows uo.)
The risk that an agreed-upon, locked in fork would not happen is lower than the risk that a vague agreement (the HK one) will break apart as has happened. I still consider the risk too high as smallblockers will certainly spend the next 3 months trying to prevent the 2x part of the compromise, but with overwhelming miner support for the 2x fork and having already provided segwit, that will not be as easy as it was to delay the whole thing by *two damn years*.
I would be *much* happier with an agreement that did both at the same time, but sadly, miners considered "in 3 months" enough of a concession. Let's just hope that a mining supermajority enforces the whole part of the agreement.
(Alternatively, we may need a UASF that invalidates Segwit transactions in blocks smaller than 8 MB... as we learned, a minority can force their will onto a majority with a UASF threat)
@_date: 2017-06-01 05:48:19


It's a chicken egg problem. The chain has to be useful to have a meaningful revenue stream.
A chain that produces a block every two weeks, and could at any point in time be 51% attacked by a major miner, is not very useful.
The main chain makes 144 blocks per day. That means that a miner controlling 20% of hashpower would need to spend less than 5% of their mining profit to quickly and decisively kill off the BIP148 chain and safeguard their investment (since a contentious fork would create chaos that is likely bad for the price).
If the expected initial hashrate of UASF is indeed this low, it's even more hopeless than I thought, even if big hodlers supporting it put the money where their  mouth is and start dumping their mainchain coins (at great personal loss).
@_date: 2017-06-02 10:03:31
The block has to have more work (not sure if that means getting lucky - i.e. the attacker having to mine twice as many blocks as they ultimately broadcast - or declaring a minimally higher difficulty). The miners would still need to strengthen the chain a bit, but not by 2x. (To clarify: longest chain does not mean most blocks, it means most work - this detail is often overlooked in explanations for simplicity).
The empty timestamps are not to get the client to accept the block, but to cause the difficulty to rise at the end of the adjustment period, making it harder to use the forked chain in the future. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 23:15:39
The other agreements didn't have 80% on chain signalling though, I think.

One of the best practices is that if there is an approach that is simple but requires more hardware, and an approach that is more efficient but much more complex, *and the cost of the additional hardware is small*, you take the simple approach and throw hardware at it. This is usally known under the mantra "premature optimization is the root of all evil".
The reason is that somebody will have to develop and most importantly maintain the complex mess you'd build, and complexity (and the associated risk of introducing bugs) very quickly becomes more expensive than hardware.
@_date: 2017-06-07 02:33:32
Holy shit, good catch. BIP148 (UASF) only orphans blocks that don't signal segwit, it doesn't force activate it directly.
From the Segwit BIP141:


From BIP9:


The median time is calculated over the current block and 10 predecessors.
Lock-in happens after a full retarget period has had threshold blocks. Depending on how lucky segwit gets, the first retarget period may be lost (by enough non segwit blocks getting mined before BIP148 (UASF) comes into force). That means that they have to complete at least one, possibly almost two, retarget periods. Assuming the best case for segwit, they still need at least ~10% of the hashing power to make it happen.
This also opens a new way to 51%-attack it. Create a chain of blocks that is a little bit stronger than the BIP148 chain. Set block timestamps to 1 second past the activation date for the first block, then one second later for each subsequent block. This chain cannot be broadcast since it would be considered invalid up shortly before the last block date. However, on the 15th of November, the chain can be broadcast, orphaning all BIP148 work, burning all the coins mined by BIP148 miners, making a huge mess for exchanges who participated in the hostile fork, and preventing the activation of Segwit on the UASF fork.
While the BIP148 ceases to be active after segwit fails to activate, this is defined by chain time and not wallclock time, so unfortunately I believe this does not mean that the UASF chain will reorg into the main chain. That would have been the cherry on the cake.

I'd like to point out that a single decent box *today* should be able to handle this load easily.
Today's decent boxes are going to be available very cheaply in 5 years.
1.2 TB/day are about 14 MB/s, but a) you interpolated that from a server designed to attract a lot of traffic b) that's still manageable for a decent server today (less than 200 Mbit, while Gbit connections are becoming more common).
A node would only have to keep up with the block chain (and possibly mempool transactions), so close to the 1.7 TB/year of chain growth. If you have more than 10 Mbps downstream you should be able to keep up with the chain *and* mempool.
This is why many of us think simply scaling on chain is the right approach.
It won't take us to VISA levels with today's hard- and software, but there is no way Bitcoin is going to need that any time soon. Scaling on-chain is simple. Sometimes, throwing a relatively small amount of hardware at a problem *is* the right solution.

At which point it becomes very hard to claim to be the original Bitcoin unless you really have a strong economic supermajority behind the fork (that also supports a PoW change). Not going to happen, especially not if the main chain also enables segwit through segwit2k. The name/network effect and the insane security provided by ASIC mining are the only advantages Bitcoin has over other cryptocurrencies. 
Also, it wouldn't render their hardware obsolete. The hardware would work just fine on what they consider the main chain, and the fork chain would have lost an additional argument for calling itself Bitcoin.

BIP148 does not enable segwit, it forces signaling. I think asicboost will work for the first 2-3 adjustment periods.


Indeed, but given the rewards on the non-BIP148 chain that the miners could lose, they do have a financial incentive to attack the fork.


Indeed, but see above. Attacking the fork could be cheaper than risking the mining rewards on the legacy chain (or their dollar value that could be affected by a fork).


It becomes easier both for the legit miners and the attackers. It doesn't affect the difficulty of the attack.
Also, once it is clear that a retarget will happen, the attacker can set low time stamps in his attack blocks and *increase* the difficulty on that chain.

German banks introduced a very secure transaction authentication system, involving a special device that securely displays your transaction, then uses your card to generate a one-time code valid only for that specific transaction.

Exactly. You mine, in secret, 100 empty, segwit-supporting blocks. When the legitimate chain reaches ~98 blocks, you broadcast your chain. That way, the BIP148 chain gains only ~2% of "free" hash power towards reaching segwit lockin before the Nov 15 deadline, but the chain is seriously disrupted: All transactions are reverted, all mining rewards have evaporated before they even could be spend (since mining rewards are unspendable for 100 blocks after being mined), and anyone who considers mining, transacting with, or trading UASFcoin has to consider the risk that this will happen again.
Just the credible threat of a 51% attack would be the end of it, IMHO.

Their goal would be to prevent an UASF to preserve the value of the blocks they mine on the main chain. Spending a part of their hash power on that seems like a wise choice if they continue to mine the main chain. If UASF were to orphan their main chain blocks at some later point, they'd lose a lot more, aside from the damage the contentious fork would likely do to the price.

Disable 2-factor and set it up again, this time writing down the key.
Alternatively, you could try to find an old version of Google Authenticator that doesn't disable backup and is signed with the same key as the current one, see if you can somehow downgrade to it without losing data, then use `adb backup` to pull out the key.
Alternatively, find a way to root your phone without wiping data, bypassing the security measures. This is intentionally designed to not be possible, but sometimes there are flaws that allow it.

The profit could be in preventing a contentious fork, or even uncertainty, that has the potential to hurt the values of both coins. It could also be in preventing a fork to a system that will move towards off-chain solutions that move future fee revenue from miners to LN hubs.
If the UASF chain surpasses the legacy chain at some point, all mining rewards mined on the legacy chain after the fork point would be wiped out. That gives all miners who continued to mine on the legacy chain a reason to sabotage the fork later.
**If** UASF gets 30% or more of mining power, the fork is likely to quickly get &gt;50% and absorb the main chain, but as far as I can see, it's nowhere near even a significant fraction of that (the last data I saw showed significantly less than 1% of total hashpower supporting it). At that rate, any individual major miner can use a fraction of their hash power to successfully 51% it.
A successful 51% attack is a pretty clear sign that the chain is not viable, unless there is a reason to believe that the attacker cannot sustain the attack. No exchange will want to accept deposits on a chain where 100-block reorgs are to be expected. No profit-oriented miner will want to mine a coin where his mining rewards *will* evaporate.


You could ask yourself the same for the people mining the fork chain. A 51% attack will completely deny them their rewards, while a successful fork is effectively a 51% attack on the miners of the main chain, and will deny *them* their reward. Thus, there is a massive incentive to sabotage the other chain. In the end, this war will likely be decided by hash power. The soft fork has a significant advantage due to the reorg risk; I think someone somewhere did the game theory math and came up with 25% or 33.3% of hash power being sufficient to make it a good idea to support the UASF chain instead of the main chain, but until that is reached because people want to support it, there is an economic incentive for miners to stay on the main chain and destroy the fork chain.
@_date: 2017-06-18 22:28:05


No. Even after Segwit is locked in on the UASF chain (which may never happen if fewer than 2000-4000 blocks are mined between the fork point and Nov 15!) a majority of hash power could arbitrarily disrupt the chain.


You are assuming a strong support of HODLers for Segwit. While you will find such support here inside the echo chamber of this subreddit, the situation is much less clear outside.
Even if we assume that the majority of people want segwit, an attacker who is willing and able to commit sufficient hash power to 51% a chain can make that chain completely unusable for as long as he is willing and able to commit that hash power. At that point, it can easily become the world's most expensive game of chicken.
And while you might be willing to wait for months until you can safely spend your coins, many people who aren't willing or able would likely go back to the majority chain (assuming it continued to exist and didn't have the 51% attack problem).
Or, the whole mess might make people switch to coins that don't have ongoing civil wars. Everybody in Bitcoin loses in that scenario, except maybe exchanges that support altcoins.

The difference is that in one case, you don't like the contract you signed, even though you understood it.
In the other case, it was pretty clear to everyone what the *intent* was, and that intent was enforced by the miner majority *just like it would have been in a regular contract by a judge*.
While it obviously violates the principle of only crypto counting, and pisses off Bitcoin hardliners, it can also be seen as a feature. It is extremely unlikely (although possible) that the miners would *arbitrarily* revert contracts that were working as intended.

Because it enables the last puzzle piece that would be needed to start forcing transactions off chain, and it was clear that by giving into it, 2MB blocks would become unlikely.

Nodes are almost irrelevant. Payment providers, merchants that want to accept directly instead of via a provider (rare), thin wallet backends, exchanges, miners  need nodes. If they only run the nodes for themselves, and there are only 50 nodes, that would already be enough to make it work for them.
SPV wallets need a couple more nodes (not too many to be honest) but nodes are cheap. If the nodes ran by volunteers are not enough, a miner could easily spawn 1000 nodes for $3k/month.
What matters is which chain exchanges, payment providers, and whales follow. I have stated my opinion and reasons, but you are free to disagree.

No issues with chargebacks, stolen cards, lower fees on their side.
This is balanced by the relatively high cost to integrate Bitcoin payments (the absolute cost may not be too terrible, but given that very few people use it, the cost per customer is pretty high). Due to this, Bitcoin usually doesn't make sense for merchants unless they're targeting a demographic that doesn't have access to credit cards/really *really* doesn't want to use credit cards *or* they're hoping that Bitcoin fanatics will buy from them just because they accept Bitcoin (which happens often enough).
As pointed out, it's pointless for buyers unless there is a discout or they want the (limited) anonymity Bitcoin provides, especially since with all other payment methods the merchant usually pays all fees while with Bitcoin, the buyer usually has to pay at least his own tx fee (and with many payment providers, often a currency conversion premium + a second tx fee to cover the cost). Bitcoin fans who are willing to pay a premium just for the privilege of being able to pay with Bitcoin is what kept this system afloat, and at the same time kept average people from using it.

It's kind of hard to "keep the prices low" by any other ways than selling coins. Sure, you can play tricks and hope people fall for it, but there's a limit to what that can achieve.
You are also suggesting that whales are keeping the prices low "to accumulate more" - why would they do that instead of buying now that the prices are low? Whales have plenty of money, so they don't have to wait for their monthly paycheck to be able to "accumulate" more. If the prices were artificially held down, it would be risky to wait, because artificially holding down the prices will not work forever.
I suspect that the main reason why Litecoin prices aren't going up more is that Litecoin does not have any obvious advantage over the alternatives. Bitcoin has the network effect/first mover advantage on its side. It is the most widely known and most widely accepted cryptocurrency. Ethereum supports smart contracts, has an enterprise variant backed by many large companies (although that is not using the main chain), and has on-chain confirmation times that are much faster than Litecoin.

The main advantage Litecoin had was that it was by far the most well known altcoin. That is long gone (Ethereum is now much more popular according to Google Trends). That leaves similarity to Bitcoin as the only remaining big advantage compared to e.g. Ethereum. OTOH Ethereum has much shorter block times (6 seconds instead of 2.5 minutes).
I'd say the network effect (i.e. popularity) is the most important factor (which is the main reason why Bitcoin is still going strong despite ridiculous fees). Ethereum managed to become popular by being interesting by offering "smart contracts" (that have very limited practical applications).

No. Let's say the main chain is called A. Let's call the last block before the fork A0. The main chain mines A1 which is a non-segwit block, and rejected by the BIP148 chain. The BIP148 chain mines block B1, their first block, and B2 on top of that, and B3 on top of that etc.
A 51% attacker mines block C1 on top of block A0, block C2 on top of C1, block C3 on top of that, etc. - in secret. Since this chain is anchored on A0, it doesn't matter what the legit miners do on the B chain.
When the "B" chain (BIP148 "legit" chain) has reached B98, and the C chain (BIP148 attack chain) has reached 100 blocks, the attacker releases blocks C1..100. Since the chain is longer than the B chain, the B chain is orphaned, all mining rewards and transactions are gone, and the longest BIP148 chain is 100 blocks long - only 2 blocks more than it had before!
Now, the legitimate miners can try to extend the B chain by mining B99, B100, etc. In this case the attacker just has to keep the C chain one block ahead.
Or, more likely, the legit miners start following the C chain, and mine a *legit* block C101 on top of C100, then C102 on top of that, etc.
The attacker now starts a new fork: He mines a block which we'll call D101 on top of **C100**, then D102 on top of that, etc. When the legit miners have reached C198 and the attacker has reached D200, the attacker releases D101..200, orphaning the legit miners' C101..C198. Again, he has contributed a net of only two blocks to the chain, but again wiped out 98 blocks worth of transactions and block rewards.
Now the attacker publishes a message, signed with the key from the coinbase of one of his blocks (or put directly into a coinbase), saying "I can and will keep this up for as long as I have to. Feel free to mine, but your blocks will always be orphaned. Your chain is dead. You lost."
At this point, the BIP148 chain will quickly lose miners. The exchanges will probably never even start to accept deposits if the BIP148 chain doesn't have massive hashpower support, simply due to the high risk of a 51% attack.
Additionally, I bet there are various funny tricks that could be played with the block time stamps, but I don't understand the rules for those well enough to go into details.

The problem that I was comparing it with (transfer to self or other person + currency conversion) is a strictly harder problem than the original one, and it's *still* cheaper. I chose it because the original one in fiat is "too cheap" and otherwise people would complain "oh, but sending it across borders is going to be more expensive".
If you want a direct comparison, Bitcoin certainly doesn't come out better: Sending money from one of my own bank accounts to another, or even any of my EUR bank accounts to *any* other EUR bank account in the SEPA zone, costs me 0. Zero, Zilch, Nada, Nothing. (Some business accounts might have a fee on receiving which tends to be something like 10 cents).

Theoretically, miners could signal segwit2x, wait until segwit locks in, then say "nah" and switch back to Core which supports segwit but will not do the hard fork.

You can't run that on a cellular or data capped connection, but running at home would be feasible as long as you had 10 Mbps uncapped (if you're OK with only getting blocks, not pending transactions, you'd be OK with 1-2 Mbps). If you're OK with being a burden on the network, you need this amount of downstream bandwidth and negligible upstream bandwidth. If you have the same amount of upstream bandwidth, you're neutral for the network (neither helping it nor placing a burden on it). If you have more, you're helping the network.
The 1.2 TB/day are for a node actively configured to massively contribute to the network. You could indeed not run *that* at home unless you have fiber, which is getting more common btw, but there is no need for you to do that even if you want to participate.
Also, at current transaction prices, it's cheaper to rent a small server in a data center than 1-2 transactions per month. If your Internet at home is shit, run a node in a DC and use its API. Or do what most people do and use a thin SPV-style client.

On the real net, miners will be sure to include that 1 MB "reward" transaction that provides ~$1M to the miner who mines the first 1 MB block (probably leaving some of it to other miners so they have an incentive to mine on top of it instead of trying to 51% to get that one tx).

Usually they do because people saying that they got the files back is better for business than people telling friends not to pay because you don't get your files back anyways.
In this case it was not real ransomware, though, so no key.

Definitely, especially if the people using Bitcoin via Tor also run relays.
2 MB per 10 minutes. Actually, fuck that, let's do the math for 20 MB blocks. So 20 MB per 10 minutes on average. Plus transactions, so let's make that 3x as much. Plus whatever you upload is more to support nodes that download more than they upload, so let's make that 10x as much for upload. And since it has to go through 3 hops in the case of Tor, or 6 for a hidden service if I remember correctly, let's take that times 6 again. 
20 MB times 3 times 10 times 6, every 600 seconds. That's 6 MByte per second, or ~50 Mbit/s, per direction. For **20** MB blocks, and a node that contributes much more to the network more than it consumes. So if you have a virtual server with only 100 Mbit/s somewhere, you might be close to saturating that line. Note that this is not what every node would need to have - a few enthusiast run nodes would do this in order to support weaker nodes. And trust me, the people who run that kind of node have more than 100 Mbit. *glances towards the fiber jack in the wall*
Let's do the math again. You have a slow connection, so you decide to use the resources that other nodes have provided to you, and you only download confirmed blocks, not mempool transactions, and we'll stick to 2 MB blocks this time. You need to download 2 MB every 10 minutes on average, and upload next to nothing (control traffic only). The Tor overhead is minimal since you don't act as a relay this time. 2000 KByte / 600 seconds = 3.3 KByte/s. Add 20% for the control traffic and overhead if you like, but 4 KByte/s total bandwidth should do. From my experience, running this from a 56k modem would be pushing the limits a bit, and you'd definitely have to wait for a while until the blocks arrive, but as long as you keep the connection going and download your initial copy of the blockchain through a decent connection, **a goddamn 56k modem would be enough to (barely) keep up with a 2 MB block chain, even if you do it over Tor**.
Edit: 2MB + segwit would push your 56k modem over the limit. Sorry, you'll have to get dual-channel ISDN. Or a real Internet connection, y'know. 10 Mbit downstream is pretty widely available, and should do the trick for a passive node on a 20 MB (total size) blockchain.

I suspect that at least one long time HODLer is going to dump their coins on the main chain (possibly driving price down) and buy segwit-coin. Since the supply of the latter might be limited, and it will be impossible to move it into exchanges for a while (low mining power, and high risk of a 51% attack) this could drive price up like crazy. That in turn might have interesting effects depending on who panics and who starts mining the seemingly profitable chain (without realizing that the newly minted coins are unmovable for 100 blocks and may get orphaned at any time).
I agree that there should be a token for it.
@_date: 2017-06-19 22:04:05


At which point does it stop being "contentious"? Segwit2x has an 80% activation threshold, i.e. it only happens when 80% of mining power have signalled support.

Also, if it's a brain wallet, he *can* spend the bitcoins from inside prison by giving the passphrase used to derive the key to someone on the outside (e.g. via his attorney, visitors, smuggled phones, ..)

If you don't want to take the risk you can of course stay out of it by moving to fiat.
The main chain has a theoretical risk of being reorg'd, but the UASF chain has a high risk of never being able to make transactions on it (due to much less mining power and thus fewer blocks) and getting 51% attacked (reversing any transactions that happen on it).
Most importantly, as a miner, your mined coins cannot be moved for 100 blocks after being mined. During normal operations that is less than a day, but if the UASF net only has 2% of the main chain, that will be over a month, *and* you may lose your mined coins if someone does a 51% attack.
That makes it unattractive to mine the UASF chain even if the price were to be higher.
What's likely to happen is that after the fork, big holders with strong opinions will sell their old coins on the fork they don't support, driving down the price, and will start buying on the fork they do support, driving up the price. How that will affect the price overall... No idea.

That might not help. On one hand, you'd think that the attacker will have to send in a copy of your ID card which is a significant hurdle.
On the other hand, the attacker has to send something that looks like a low-quality copy of a real ID card and matches your name. This is easily provided with photoshop, and comes with a free choice of signature...

If you get the ECDSA private key, then you own that address, i.e. you can just send the bitcoins to any address you want. However, AFAIK the ECDSA public keys which would probably be needed for such an attack are only public if at least one (outgoing) transaction has been made with that address (otherwise, only their hashes are public).
A break of ECDSA would still cause large problems, since any bitcoins for which the public key was known could be stolen, so it would cause a lot of stolen BTC and undermine the trust in the system.
A break of the PRNG used to generate the keys (think Debian OpenSSL) would be worse, that would allow you to steal all BTC stored in an address generated by the vulnerable client.

This is true for Nigeria scams because they need people to fall for later stages and they require manual effort per person. For phishing, they rely on impersonating the original site - unless they are trying to phish account data for some shitty Justin Bieber forum, they should use perfect English. Weeding out non-idiots only makes them lose out.

It does verify the sender IP though, which is pretty good, but fails if the e-mail was forwarded while keeping the headers intact (e.g. by a server-side "forward all my emails to my second account" feature). I think *bidirectional* IP spoofing is rare on the Internet.
DKIM solves that (and to do so, indeed needs to ensure the message wasn't changed during transfer). If you *really* want to authenticate a sender, they should offer S-MIME signatures. I wonder why few to none of them actually do.

If you had the public key. Unless you used part of the funds in that address before, the blockchain only contains the *hash* of the public key.
Edit: After reading the documentation, for whatever reason this may not hold true for coin-generating (mining) transactions

I think the prison sentences we might be talking about here could be long enough to be a problem for the crypto used in Bitcoin. Imagine how frustrating it would be to sit in prisons and hear about weaknesses of ECDSA in 15 years, critical problems that make a break likely and Bitcoin preparing a migration to better algorithms in 20 years, migration completed in 25 and as he gets released 30 years from now, gets to a computer, goes to the download site of a client to cash out his coins, and sees a note that all non-migrated coins have been stolen since ECDSA was finally broken.
