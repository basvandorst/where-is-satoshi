Yeah, of course. I'm not considering the two first guys I found. I literally have contacted and spoke with hunderds of sellers across different paltforms in the last couple days. These two do have perfect profiles. 
The thing is I need the transacion to be completly anonymous on my end, so I'm asking if either Western Union or MoneyGrab don't need me to formally indentify myself in any way when sending over US$ 3,000.00, and if they do, then they are not options for me. Is there any way I could send either of them the money and will keep me anonymous?

Thanks for the insightful answer.

Sadly no. Unless there's some workaround I don't know about. 
There's no way (some service maybe) of sending money to the bank account of a person in another country without identyfing myself? That's the only solution I could think of.

What tumbling/mixing method would you recommend and why?

Wouldn't that way leave a trace because of the history of transactions? Isn't that something I could do with so many other methods which aren't really obscuring the data of where the money first was and how was first used?
As far as I understand only way of obtaining Bitcoins anonymously is with cash because in any formal way links back to me.

What do you mean?... PayPal isn't anonymous.

Yeah, I know that. I was expecting you to tell me there was some hack/magic spell that would help me put funds into a non-verified account in an anonymous way. Thanks for the recommendation though.
