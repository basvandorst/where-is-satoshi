They aren't. Banks lend money into existence... with 30 to 1 leverage, sometimes more. Banks are the problem, not Government.

When you "loan" to a bank at practically zero percent interest, you are essentially giving them money..

Although I agree with the sentiment, I'm not a libertarian and feel like I should speak out as people have a tendency to put all of us bitcoiners into one philosophical basket. I believe that Government should function, schools should not be sold off to the highest bidding company, fire departments should not be privatized, etc. However I believe banks have too much power. The financial services industry brought the world to it's knees a few years ago, and it continues unchecked despite the Volker rules. So I love bitcoin. It takes away the power from the issuing authorities to invent money out of thin air to pay off bad gambling bets made by investment banks. It empowers we the people.

Here we go. Looking at bitcoinity, all I can think is we're on an express elevator to hell, going down. I'm glad for it though. I want to buy more!

Submitted a request for identity authentication weeks ago, got errors. Contacted tech support including direct email to someone in Gox who I had contacted previously. No reply. Resubmitted docs a few days later, error was resolved but still no verification, system still pending, and no email from their ***support*** staff. 
I can see the commercials now: "We're Mt. Gox. We don't have to care."

When you backup your wallet do you just select the backup wallet function in qt or do you actually mv wallet.dat someotherdirectory/wallet.dat? Also what about encrypting a backed up wallet with pgp? Is this standard? TIA and congrats on the backup- thats a pretty big "whew!!"
@_date: 2013-10-17 09:11:18
That is also very cool.  And bookmarked! Thanks.
@_date: 2013-10-17 03:59:26
OK that makes sense- what I'm trying to ask I guess is what happens if the demand exceeds the supply in any exchange? Or vice versa? Does the exchange table the purchase or sell request until there are sufficient buyers or sellers? Or does this scenario just never come up?

I hope so. I want to go big. But not at 200 bucks.

Or put in the vernacular of today's go-getting generation: cool story bro.

For more than one reason ;-)

Also, why would people be downvoting this? I think its very cool, on topic, etc..
@_date: 2013-12-16 04:23:33


Yes. Exactly. And when people don't pay their "fire insurance" they get to watch their house burn down. Businesses exist to increase their profit but sometimes you have to put human life above pure profit making. Just my opinion though and I'm sure it isn't appropriate for the BTC subnet.

That was just political theater. Rest assured, if they think something exists that could threaten to take money out of the hands of the oligarchy or heaven forfend hurt the greenback, government will move surprisingly quickly to "address" it..

My superpower is knowing that something will be important way before the rest of the world. My kryptonite is lazyness. I wanted to buy a ton of BTC a couple of years ago, was all ready to do it, but had problems with my computer, then got lazy. derpman!
@_date: 2013-10-18 04:49:40
I guess I was - seems coinbase is a lot cheaper than Mt. Gox at present. Thanks for the tip :-) maybe I'll just buy a little and play around with it. Cheers
@_date: 2013-10-24 07:42:54
I agree! Finally I can buy in!

I feel like Riply in Aliens when she says to Bishop, its very pretty but what are we looking at?

Bitcoin is getting Decimated! Buy now because we might just be at the floor ;-)

No kidding. I love Clifford Stoll and was shocked that he would be coming down on bitcoin like the misleading title of the post declared. 
@_date: 2013-10-24 03:45:52
I enjoy this kind of enthusiasm but not sure if saying regulatory risk is low is justified. How do they know? I'm sure that the more BTC gains market traction the more the Fed is going to demand a clamp down. Question is, how could they regulate it fairly? Also what would be the impact of a sudden tax requirement on exchanges? Some kind of development like this must be going on behind the scenes, and when the announcements are made, pop goes the bubble..
@_date: 2013-10-24 08:04:45
Could they?

Just stopping by myself. And I appreciate you're words of caution eggbrain- it's easy to get sucked into groupthink mania and throw tempered investing out the window. Take it slow, test the waters, etc..

It's all networking isn't it. Goddamn handshake and a martini at the right club. Maybe I should take up golf.

Sounds like an excellent strategy. Cheers
@_date: 2013-12-18 06:18:14
I'm buying all the way down. BTC will rebound. India is entering the market, institutional adoption is becoming more and more widespread, etc etc. The current sell off is just feedback driven from automated trading software. It will rebound. No reason to think it won't. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 07:10:08
I do this daily- anytime some company sends me an email about their new product blahblah, I just reply and say give me your BTC address. 
@_date: 2013-11-01 03:55:26
Goes without saying but read into it what you will.
@_date: 2013-12-09 00:55:22


Although I agreed with the majority of the article,  these kinds of statements are just absurd to me. What bubble? Who decides this? How do they know? Based on what? 
Bitcoin is stochastic, it is volitile, and it is utterly new so there is no analytical basis to say whether it is in a bubble or not. The only thing we can know and state unequivocally is it will either go up, or it will go down. Other than that you are just speculating.

I heard they had seized the BTC via taking a copy of the server hosting SR, but I never heard if they actually got the private key- did they? I've read that the blockchain.info file contains the private key anyway so even passphrase protecting the local private key wouldnt help.. anyone know if this is true?
@_date: 2013-10-24 07:49:42
Commenting on my own thread here- but I'm watching (listening) to the site now- it's very cool but is it only showing transactions? Or is there a way to grep whether these are buys or sells?
