Same. I found out about it 8 years ago, thought it was funny people were buying pizza with it, thought about mining, and never did. I was also just 16 or so.
I thought about buying in 2013 during the bubble but was a broke student and it was too late for mining to be profitable without a bunch of asics. 
Now my co-workers started buying BTC at 5k and friends started buying altcoin for pennies. They all made money. And I'm still crypto-less.
I'm always the first to get on the hype train for new technology but am the last to adopt it.

Also look at NYC. Taxis pay for a permit. Uber drivers do not and people choose Uber more. This is a problem. 
Edit: I use Uber. Read further down to understand why Uber in NYC in the current state of taxi regulation is a problem. In my opinion, the problem is fixed by taxi drivers no longer having an obligation to pay for an NYC taxi permit.

Yes, but that's not what I'm talking about here. I'm talking about understanding Sen. Sanders reasoning for disapproving of unregulated taxi or taxi like services. It's good that alternatives disrupt the traditional taxi industry. It's bad when there are people trapped driving yellow cabs and can't get employment at the alternatives for economical reasons. Cab driver debt to the city is one cause of this. Uber being able to circumvent regulation is another. 
Again, it's good when the industry is disrupted. Much of the success of Uber is in not having to abide by traditional regulations, which is fine. It's good when traditional cab companies have to progress their service. It's bad when traditional cab drivers are required to pay for special permits that Uber drivers do not have to pay for.
Solution: pass a bill that removes this requirement.

Exactly, and that's perfectly fine! But there is a lot of hate for the NYC government for not updating taxi regulation to be more friendly in the market space. Application services are far superior to the regular taxi, but every worker outside that ecosystem suffers. Taxi drivers are in debt because they have to pay for their own city permit and don't have the means to change employment. Either get Uber and Lyft out of NYC, or the city of New York should get rid of the NYC taxi permit. Personally, I prefer the latter.
This is why a lot of people, including Sen. Sanders, are voicing their dissent.

Taxi drivers don't like how the taxi industry is regulated either. In cities with huge permit costs that put drivers in debt, drivers are often unable to "progress". They're stuck.

Yes, but that's not the point and not the only reason. Not only is it a worse service, taxi drivers are indebted to the city of New York, working in shittier conditions than Uber and Lyft drivers, and have big problems changing employment because of their debt. Traditional taxi's would still continue to be phased out if the permit were no longer required, but services would then be on a level playing field.

I'm in that generation. I don't know when it started, but it's not new. I remember about 8 years ago kids in 8th grade talking about how they got their MySpace hacked. Their friend guessed the password.

Hell, I remember in 7th grade we discussed Women's Rights. OP's teacher is a disgrace to the education system.

By this logic, if I give someone my facebook password and they change my info, they hacked it.
