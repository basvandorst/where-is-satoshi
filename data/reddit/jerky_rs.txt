When you buy gold do you get it physically? Most exchanges are not allocating you your bitcoin on chain unless you send to your own wallet. My point is as a store value you do not need high through put as it can be handled off chain, certainly for a day to day currency you want high tps which is why cash has been replaced as it takes longer nowadays to use cash then waving your magic card at the till. I'm not convinced bitcoin can be used as a day to day currency unless the lightening network somehow solves the tps issue or other side chains are used to handle smaller transactions between two parties

Her digital strategies have always been nieve,  she thinks it would be possible to implement backdoors to decrypt all traffic to standard web servers and IM, obviously she doesn't know how the internet works or encryption and even if you were to backdoor all communication to standard services an encryption that is not backdoored would be used by criminals (gpg + 256 bit aes zip known to the criminals).
I'm actually a May supporter as everyone else is a clown, maybe Reese mogg (barf) or Farage would be alternatives who might achieve something but don't see that happening

I think you meant bull market for the last 7 years..   I'm not sure bitcoin halves down to 3k if that's what your implying  but who knows, certainly I agree financial institutions are preparing crypto infrastructure and I certainly see bitcoin a possible reserve currency in the years to come which is my point on USD crash or other general market downturn ,  seems to be yours as well as why else would you move away from USD other then you don't like US holding that honour or it's not worth holding as your loosing money

Like any centralized service you must inherently trust it is there tomorrow, coinbase is not regulated in the same way a bank is so you loose the protection afforded to you by the government and associated insurance to secure your funds(or coins). by storing it in your own wallet you only need to trust the software you use and your private key

Maybe collapse is the wrong word, replaced as the reserve currency , the dollar will always be worth a dollar:-) I am sure many foreign countries who are US competitors(China, Russia, Turkey,..) would like to hold something other then the dollar as a reserve.
@_date: 2018-09-19 18:43:56
If other markets fail people will look to one that is not inherently linked to sustain wealth,  if USD crashes what would foreign banks do who hold it as a reserve?

Problem is bitcoin transactions currently take 10 to 60 minutes,  not really useful if you want to buy  some food at the store take longer to pay with btc then shop, maybe the lightening network can fix this.
The fluctuating in price doesn't help either from a vendors point of view never mind buyer,  until people don't convert it back to USD and just use it  day to day it's not really a functional currency , but most people who hold btc do so for speculative investment so it's competing against gold now rather then being a currency as it was probably originally intended.
@_date: 2018-09-28 06:48:24
When you buy and hold gold do you have the bar of gold yourself or are you trusting someone to hold it for you in account of some sort, if you hold bitcoin in your own wallet you trust the decentralized network ledger.
I doubt most gold holders actually have the bar of gold themselves

Ya its interesting question, would BTC go up ? obviously people's sell orders on USDT pair would trigger as it goes up leaving them with tether instead of the USD equilivant.

Stable now isn't it,  well for the last and next week 
@_date: 2018-10-15 09:44:39
That's right, keep it simple, if BTC was 10k USD and tether fell to 50 cents the BTC /USDT pairing would be 20k USDT.
Problem is that USDT sell orders would trigger meaning people would be buying a plummeting Tether., would this then stabilize the tether?

Decentralization is what is truely important as you say, PoW certainly achieves this but  could be replaced in other blockchain initiatives although as we are seeing some of these other initiatives  shortcut to achieve speed by restricting decentralization (dpos) so still PoW is a necessary evil

My comment could be taken either way depending on your perspective 
@_date: 2018-10-06 18:50:35
Agree,  it is funny to hear people complain about coins not having an ICO. A good project with an initial seed funding shouldn't need more money, some if the sizes of these ico are ridiculous.
@_date: 2018-10-26 18:49:37
Here's a thought, maybe the banks could really acquire Bitcoins and loan them out to only one person at a time, sadly we all know banks want to loan money they dont have and sell the debts to others who buy them with other people's loans.

You don't think Craig also could have been the voice, why is that so unbelievable? Kleinman the author and David pushing the agenda, the fact that bitcoin was originally released on message board that Kleinman used for years under an alias... Coincidence?

As per my comment above/below you cant pick and choose elements of a prophecies prediction that might be right, based on the dominance that would imply a large ALT boom.

Just find the next big blockchain project and get involved with that.
@_date: 2019-08-28 06:22:48
Seems people miss entirely the comment on BTC dominance.... If that is to play out we are going to see much larger ALT run in the near future.

Kleinman was Satoshi, he had the necessary background and knowledge, in sure Craig was involved but he is not the core author 
It is sad how Kleinman own family seemingly didn't care until they realized money might be involved, he died alone days went by until someone found his body.  
Go read Kleinman bio, it is in no doubt the author..

It's bitcoin but ASIC resistant, solid project no ICO no premine community led.

Do you restock your USD?  once that term is dropped maybe then we have functional currency. If you live in US you don't think to yourself you have 100 Euros, you think I have dollars, same applies if you are in Europe you don't constantly think you have X amount in USD ,you just know what the value is to your local economy.
When people stop converting bitcoin to USD or some other currency then it's probably really a success as we would actually be using it.
@_date: 2018-11-29 17:54:49
So why bother.. until you can just hold comfortably day to day adoption will be slow.
I think once people have dispersed it more equally it will be less volatile and therefore usable  on a daily basis.
@_date: 2018-11-29 18:26:25
Ok you win im not against you but credit cards also protect you, what if you send your bitcoin to a fraudster or the company you bought from goes under(travel company)
@_date: 2018-11-28 20:03:42
So we have a long way to go.. 1 BTC today is a lot better then it was yesterday, that might be fine for us but not so good for a merchant selling you something.
@_date: 2018-11-02 21:22:24
The guy in this video responding to if bitcoin can be considered currency was brilliant, I bet those two other guys now hold bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-29 14:00:45
So one day they sell something like a motorbike for 1btc next day BTC tanks by 1k not sure a merchant willing to loose their profit.
@_date: 2019-01-02 22:12:28
Well done!
It could go up or down the community is probably split on this, a lot of people on other exchanges are just day trading (coinbase there  are higher fees to buy/sell then say Binance).
When you buy bitcoin on Coinbase technically it is not a real bitcoin until you withdraw it which proves it now is as its a registered on chain, the problem with this is fractional reserve or printing of bitcoin by an exchange, if coinbase have 10,000 BTC in all there wallets who's ever going to know they sold 20,000 to current users (no one audits them in this regard) unless they all try to withdraw.
Hopefully users withdrawing bitcoin will actually cause it to be more RARE on the exchange meaning it goes up in price, however if people get nervous they might also sell and because the liquidity will be lowered there will be less  buy / sell orders meaning someone dumping BTC or buying will have more effect on price movement.
So be prepared for any , up / down or flatline :)
@_date: 2018-11-28 18:15:21
Problem is it's to volatile to use, maybe when more people have less of each the volatility will go down then only need to worry about scaling transactions via some second layer protocol

Pretty sure we're not yet at Anger, we might of had capitulation with the 50% drop from 6 to 3k but  do we really think we're gonna start a longer term rally, short term rally sure but not convinced until we break 6k properly.

Awesome, so technically that is  18:15:05 UTC tomorrow (or today if you are already on January 3rd)
@_date: 2018-12-06 17:35:45
Sadly I agree merchant s don't want to take risk of holding BTC.
Only once more people have BTC will its price stabilize because it would be less possible for more BTC to be sold by a group of trader's.
Is bitcoin a store of value or is it a currency, it was intended to be currency but if it fluctuates so much then how do you use it for currency. Gold isn't exactly used for currency.
@_date: 2018-12-15 18:40:45
But sellers are doing so as their scared (panic) , maybe someone else thinks it's time to be greedy.

How much do these things cost in gold? I bet no one knows that either. Gold has effectively transitioned from currency to store of value, maybe bitcoin can do both or maybe not.
Gold value is also expressed in dollars but no one debates that it has value even though most gold is paper gold and the holders don't really own it in reslity, they just believe they do.
@_date: 2018-12-20 13:27:22
I think you misunderstood my comments, I am saying I have BTC on exchange. Printing of bitcoin I refer to the available liquidity of bitcoin on a given exchange, these are off chain transactions for the most part, what stops an exchange from selling bitcoins they don't actually have (printing bitcoin).
I totally agree storing your BTC off exchange is the best option 
@_date: 2018-12-15 20:48:19
Not sure I follow , these companies have said they will be launching or have launched BTC backed custody or ETFs. 
I'm not expecting them to buy my bags assuming I have them which I may or may not, not sure what leads you to believe I have bags.
The fact is if they are going to sell BTC backed products then they need to actually have them, assuming there not paper BTC.
@_date: 2018-12-04 08:26:33
Ya there were many dips in the last 6 months 
@_date: 2018-12-15 19:05:14
Ok but if there is 800 billion total market cap one would expect more USD volume because the USD market cap is higher so more USD to move around. The fact current market cap is at 100 billion would by definition mean less money to generate USD volume. If more BTC are actually exchanging means market is more active (panic sellers maybe)
Volume in USD is misleading anyway because one BTC could be flipped 100 times contributing to 3100 X 100 = $310,000 volume, would it not be more relevant generally to know how many unique coins are being flipped.
Sadly most of this volume is off chain anyway so no real way to know.
@_date: 2018-12-04 05:38:15
Which dip? 
@_date: 2018-12-09 18:11:55
Volatility will go down as more users hold BTC, if there is only 25 million who own bitcoin today when most being day trader's/speculators the price can fluctuate to much to be used as day to day currency..
If you have 1 billion regular holders then each would have less and more people would have to buy and sell to make it fluctuate so greatly.
@_date: 2018-12-19 21:48:14
The question really is do all exchanges hold a real bitcoin for every bitcoin a client has. I bet they don't, what happens when the exchange doesn't have any more where do they get them from? OTC or other exchange or just print some ?
@_date: 2018-12-17 18:28:10
When everyone else says so
@_date: 2018-12-01 15:56:16
Nevermind the fact most these are off chain transactions on exchange so it's not even using Blockchain.
Id be more impressed with a fraction of volume if onchain or via second layer protocol.
@_date: 2018-12-21 19:04:35
I think something commonly over looked is actual BTC volume, ignore USD volume, of course if you have market cap of 300 billion your total USD volume will be higher then when you have 70 billion, let's say 20% of BTC moves in 300 billion that 60 billion usd, but if you have higher percentage on lower market cap of is not going to appear as high even though more BTC is moving.
The other reality is that with exchange volume you don't really know because they are not all on chain transactions for each trade, they seem to be grouped.
It is certainly possible more BTC volume occurred even with less USD equivalent. I'm not saying it did but what should we believe.
@_date: 2018-12-10 19:01:37
It's by design that if hashrate drops so does difficulty making it more lucrative for remaining miners as it becomes easier to mine and less competition.
@_date: 2018-12-15 18:52:59
I think volume is generally misleading, 10 billion volume on 100 billion market cap is better then 50 billion on 800 billion market cap(percentage wise)
I appreciate someone could flip the same coin multiple times a day or they could be individual coins but that is not analyzed in volume.
@_date: 2018-12-20 07:59:46
I agree off exchange is best but it won't stop the printing of bitcoin on exchange.
It would be nice if a custody based exchange would setup server side wallet per client.

Well if they have convinced everyone to sell and can manipulate it back up they will be laughing.
I had been wondering how exactly these new institutional investors would create liquidity in their own exchange, if they plan to back it with real bitcoins they need to buy them from somewhere before they launch. Bakkt, Ameritrade, fidelity, van Eck where do they get BTC from to sell to their future clients? OTC sure but that doesn't really change price only on current exchanges 
Who knows just a thought.
