don't worry, no one hacked you camera and has a video of you watching porn that he's going to send to all your contacts.

Gemini has a scheduled buy option
@_date: 2019-11-01 17:08:55
Sold it today, after fees, I ended up with about .1 BTC in profit.
@_date: 2019-11-05 16:47:55
no, I switched to Gemini, but thats the thing I hate most about it.  It's a two step process to buy.
@_date: 2019-11-05 19:57:37
I'm calling it... It'll hit $10k at some point today
@_date: 2019-10-31 19:44:08
I'm HODLing the bulk of my coin for a long time.  This one coin was bought with borrowed money.  Selling it tomorrow as planned.  If things hold, I'll make $1000.

I'm having fun with "the prophecy".  Two days ago I bought one bitcoin (at $8200) out of my home equity, betting on the prophecy.  If when it goes to $16,000 this month, I'll sell it right then. If not on October 31st I'm going to sell it. (yes, I know the prophecy is BS and I have other bitcoin that I've had a while, that I'm hodling).
So lets she what happens.

it's fun because it was right twice so far, it's fun because imaging a rise to $16k at this point would be a freaky coincidence.
@_date: 2019-10-31 16:44:35
I believe... if the profits from the sale brought you past that $9000 income mark, you would.  If not, you wouldn't.
@_date: 2019-10-09 16:46:40
no, I don't plan on selling my main stash.  Just this one that i used borrowed money to sell. (and I might just sell half and add the other half to my hodlings
@_date: 2019-10-31 20:20:15
got it. makes more sense
@_date: 2019-10-11 19:30:01
I'm about 40/1 BTC/alts.  I'm very glad I didn't get carried away with the alts.  Maybe if I forgetabout them and look in a few years one of my alts will be green.

you lost me at " wisdom of the redditors"
@_date: 2019-10-31 15:43:57
Hypothetically, what would you think if it actually jumped to $16k today (it won't i know, but for the fun of it, what would you really think if it happened)?
@_date: 2019-10-09 17:40:24
for long term, I wouldn't recommend it.  But for a short term gamble.  I don't see a huge downside.  Fanous last words but... how much could I lose in a month.
If I thought to do this, then didn't and the prophecy actually happened, then I would kick myself.

Say I buy a coin for $9000, the price goes up to $10,000.  I sell 90% of that coin (for $9000), withdraw it and keep the last 10% ($1000 worth) in Bitcoin.
Is that a taxable event.  I didn't make any "cash profit" from the exchange.  I started with $9000 in cash and ended with $9000 in cash.  Did I make a "profit"?  Or do I only make a profit when I cash out the remaining $1000?

Big bucks... no Whammy

Tomorrow is the day?!?!?
@_date: 2019-10-31 14:29:04
$16k !!!!
@_date: 2019-10-17 19:27:50
If you want to try day trading bitcoin I recomend taking $200 and day trade with that. What you will find is that you lose it fast. That's what I did and realized I wasn't any good at it and just HODL.
@_date: 2019-10-09 19:29:33
and imaginary prophecies
@_date: 2019-10-31 16:43:21
but would you think the prophecy had any merit, it was a self fullfilling prophecy, or a totaly freak coincidence?
@_date: 2019-10-30 18:10:07
Where ever Snowden is
@_date: 2019-10-09 17:35:07
because it's borrowed money and there is no guarentee in the Bitcoin world.

That's aiming kinda low for a "why not" wish.
