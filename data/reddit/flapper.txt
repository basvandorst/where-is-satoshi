1.9 days?
80^4 / 36 / 86,400 = 13.17

Follow up: I contacted their support and they confirmed it is because I have a second password. The decryption page can't handle 2nd passwords and you need to use an alternative.

I recommend not using this. Whilst you would only run this on a completely disconnected computer, you should know that the secret keys are store in plain text and quite easy to access. It's also too easy to accidentally delete your keys from localstorage.
I wouldn't touch it until the author at least adds client-side password encryption.
And if you were going to "buy some cheap used tablet" you may as well use the proper Google authenticator app that would be available anyway.

I logged a support ticket. Glad I checked and tried that decryption page and didn't rely on a backup.

You should patent this. Could be worth millions.
1. Wait until BTC drops to a daily low
2. buy $30,000 worth
3. price climbs to +$10 what you paid , then sell for a gross profit

I just tried this page to test out my backup. It decrypts fine, but the json doesn't have the private keys it in, just the address, label but the key is "null".
    {
    "addr":"1MyBitcoinAddresssssssss",
    "label" : "Test",
    "priv" : null
    }
Is this what is expected?
