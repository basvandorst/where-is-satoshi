Oh yeah man no problem I just decided I wanted to get on the front page and there’s no better way

Anonymity, good fellow. Eventually after enough posts if someone REALLY REALLY tried they might be able to piece together where you live, your name, email, whatever. Every month or so just to be safe I recreate it. I’m paranoid though.

I hate to rain on your parade, but as someone who is both a fan of cryptos and a professional equity investor... 
Risk factors are mostly CYA stuff written by lawyers. They cover a bunch of random stuff in there so investor can't sue them. After you read a thousand of those, you'll realize this too. It doesn't indicate at all that this is threat to its business model. 
The first one is actually about counter party risk -- ie the risk of their clients being idiots by betting big on cryptos and going belly up. Like if you lend $10K to your friend, who spent it on booze and then killed himself. 
The second excerpt is standard language covering all emerging technologies. Every time new tech comes along, you need to spent money investigating and potentially implementing it. Nothing to see here. 
The 3rd part is just stating the obvious, and in no way indicates that it is a threat. 
Let's remain realistic. Inaccurate interpretation of events certainly will not help the cause.

Dude that’s exactly my strategy! I love me some free karma.
I make a new reddit account every month or so and I post an old meme every time so I can post in certain Reddit’s that require karma
@_date: 2018-02-27 06:01:17
New VPN for each account

@_date: 2018-02-27 05:56:29
You’re a fool. I’ve been on reddit for 11 days not 7.
@_date: 2018-02-26 20:03:34
They have to count to 3,600 and then go back to earth. 7 Years will have passed
