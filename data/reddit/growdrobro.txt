Bitcoin machines look like arcade games to me

Conservatives are just outdated in general. I wouldn’t say that they’re killing bitcoin. I don’t think bitcoin can be killed at this point. If it is killed something else will come in it’s place. People want money to be money again. It’s not something that will just go away because conservatives don’t like it. 
Dt is a problem, but I don’t think his stance on bitcoin is the focal point of why he’s a problem.

Lol the economy has never been strong. But over half of Americans can’t afford an unexpected 500 dollar bill. 
You are blind to your countries needs. The economy is awful here, so are our roads, so is the housing market. 
This is not the strongest time in American history, it’s rivaled to the worst. I don’t give a shit how anyone talks. I give a shit about the fact that trump is just another useless president, much like Obama. 
I’m not on either side of the fence, but objectively trump is a fool, and has done absolutely nothing to help this country or the people in it. 
Words are words. Idc that he says racist shit, idc that he never stops running his fucking mouth, I care about the fact that my country is poor and has multiple crisis going on in it.

I thought the point of crypto was to dodge all the banks and bullshit, but it looks to me like we’ve just created our own versions in this community. I’d get a hard wallet and just save it. I’m holding my stuff till it’s novelty or it makes me rich. But avoid exchanges and online wallets. Get a hard wallet and just save it.
