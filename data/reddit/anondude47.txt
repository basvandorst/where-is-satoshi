This has nothing to do with actual finance at the moment. Sure, the turmoil is short term until we turn to the literally limitless source of energy that is the sun. But until then, all the numerous industries are still dependent on oil and they are getting it cheaper than ever. Combined with the cost of shifting into renewables (unless it is grid level), this will cause further problems for solar/hydro etc to break the energy market. Saudis aren't idiots. They have seen the end of oil (their minister literally said this with a very odd choice of words - "the stone age did not end because there were no more stones, the oil age will also end before oil itself does") and this move is very much reflective of the fact. All the nonsense of pricing out US players is very short term.


Canada is also massively oil based. As is a large % of US (though much less than any other developed economy). As is much of scandinavia. Not all oil economies are regressive regimes with terrorist affiliations like Saudi.
You need to stop generalising and call a spade a spade. We are fucked for at least another year or two before the idiots around the world realise shifting to renewables is no longer an option but a necessity. Until then, we are fucked.

Yes. As in, we know it is possible for 2 inputs to yield the same hash. The hash space is limited by 62^(hash length) (assuming 26 small + 26 capital + 10 digits) after all. So even with a hash length of like 50 characters, you have like a 4.6 x 10^89 vector space ... which is large, but not infinite. However, if a supercomputer today is able to generate hashes that match for 2 different pieces of content, your phone will be able to do it in a few decades.

Commodities are important for the economy. Oil at the cheapest levels in history isn't good for anyone, least of all for climate. It is one of the epicenters of the financial turmoil in the world right now.

Not a peep in the forum? This is what mainstream adoption looks like guys. The fucking fed will have blockchain running their transaction system. This is the start of the beginning.
@_date: 2016-01-12 11:53:37
Because central banks are still necessary to manage the economy. They're doing a *really* bad job of it, yes. But you do not realise the importance of how much they control and influence and have to keep in check to stabilise the economy. If they don't control the money, the govt or bigger banks will ... which will make it all the worse. Maybe there will be changes to the bitcoin set up to prevent anyone from hoarding and acting as the source of all cash. I don't see it yet. Until then, there is always the risk that a central entity to control the money flow will pop up simply by appropriating bitcoins legally.

Apparently you don't know how a market works.
@_date: 2016-01-12 21:04:18
That is true of literally anything isn't it? Which is why I was trying to point out that OPs statement that cheap oil is good for the economy doesn't hold true. Price swings out of whack with historical range is bad for any asset. 
@_date: 2017-03-11 04:59:09
He's wrong. The expectation is that the authority in charge has the resources to investigate such an accusation in the case of Best Buy. It does not, in the case of BTC.

All currencies go up in value as people adopt it. The only difference is the limit you mentioned.

On the chinese offloading? Check zerohedge. That website pushes both the good and bad sides of bitcoin with far more knowledge than much of MSM. But that isn't a primer of any sort.
About finance in general? I dunno man. Everyone knows about chinese bitcoin hoarding and mining. It's a trivial connection for me since I watch the markets daily and can see the CNY dropping and BTC rising on my screen. Maybe get some good sources on your list to keep track of this.

Stupidity. This sub is more than others, but for all the coding skills of the community, these people do not understand finance. There are very few people in the industry right now who understand how insanely revolutionary Bitcoin is. And there are even lesser people who understand how long such a massive and traditionally entrenched industry takes to recognise innovations. 
@_date: 2017-01-05 16:48:04
The jump is because of CNY offloading in China. Why does this sub know so little about the markets? Jesus. My tech knowledge is amateurish, but people should know how things are priced if they're planning to play the finance game.
@_date: 2017-01-23 07:09:50
It reduces a lot of back end overhead for banks. For every major customer facing office in NYC, there are massive centers focused on consolidating transactions based in India, China, Pakistan etc. Once they adopt a blockchain, they can phase out those centers since the technology is so far ahead of what they currently have that the extra cost of automating consolidation/error-checking etc is peanuts compared to the long term gains of automation.
@_date: 2017-01-23 12:04:06
Lol. One massive EM surge and all your value will simply disappear. When people in finance tell you something, you should know that they have a better understanding of how value is defined than literally anyone on this sub. Gold will always remain. It has survived 3000 years and it'll survive more until we reach post scarcity.
@_date: 2017-01-06 13:47:07
I think it'll take longer than they imagine (maybe down till 2018 for $3000 even if it touches like nearly $2500 by end of 2017). But it's going to happen. No question about it. However, considering say $700 is the actual "fair value" for BTC and the rest of the ride up is due to speculation, that'd mean around 4x in organic growth to reach $3000. This is tight by 2018. It *could* explode, but there's far too much uncertainty in the market to be betting on it to happen in two years. Buy and hold is the best strategy.

No, it is a speculative bubble because the only thing driving it is CNY. Not because adoption rates have suddenly increased and there is high organic demand for the currency.

I don't think they're "fast" dropping anything. The rmb is still nowhere close to a exchange currency. Although China will make sure it will be. Until then, the dollar pretty much decides a lot of stuff including movements in oil prices.

Mises is an extremely biased source. I mean, the whole institute was set up by an Austrian economist. Don't get me wrong. I do believe Austrian school is better than this, but it'll be tough understanding what the downfalls are from such biased websites.
@_date: 2016-09-22 05:20:59
Just fyi, and I'll sound like a douche because you're asking for a source and I'm not bothering with one because I'm on mobile, taxing the rich more is a legit fiscal policy. Do not read mainstream economists who have a very left/right leaning tendency and form your opinions. There are tons of links out there that say otherwise.
@_date: 2016-09-01 13:55:25
It's not about the truth dude. It's about covering your bases. I read Mises as well as stuff much *much* more biased like zerohedge. But it isn't a good starting point for any newcomer who doesn't know the history behind Baron Mises and the friction between those schools of thought.
@_date: 2016-09-03 17:28:08
1) I don't disagree with Austrian economics. It's a damn sight more sensible sounding than this Keynesian nightmare we are in now.
2) Covering your bases is the only way to be objective. If you don't think that is true, you are as bad as the idiots who dismiss bitcoin out of hand as "having no value" and who cannot understand the level of genius behind that most people cannot even aspire to.
@_date: 2016-10-01 07:57:06
Quick protip for y'all: I know the majority of this sub is not in the finance world, but do not discount zerohedge just because he *sounds* like a tinfoil hat conspiracy theorist. Everyone and their mother who is worth any bit of their weight in financial research and the markets reads zerohedge. They just don't admit to it in public for reasons of stigma. That said, the site heavily leans towards agendas without even bothering to cover themselves up (eg: they were always against the immigration in Europe even before it was approved, they support Trump unequivocally against Hillary). So, to my own sensibility, I find them very upfront and easy to filter out the propaganda and get at the meat. And god is there meat. Much of what they publish, even if from syndicated websites, is very very nice data that you can use for your own reports if needed (remove the watermark and the metadata just to be sure). Hence, like OP says, read zerohedge.

That was the rating agency that went to the DoJ or someone and argued how the others were causing the entire system to fail by being assholes driven by money and not using their brains to rate stuff. It was the first time I'd heard of them and only zh seemed to know who they even were.

It's nothing of the sort. Not yet. People need to keep their hype in their pants in this sub. It'll take at *least* another market crash before btc begins to become part of the economy. And all the agenda driven fools who are waxing lyrical about the block chain will finally acknowledge btc is a good investment. Until then, rage all you want, but recognise reality. Nobody with any brains in the industry understands Bitcoin.

1 is what you're heading towards with negative interest rates. The time value of money is going negative so $100 today will be $110 tomorrow. However, that won't stop people from craving more money and spending it. I understand your statement but you're thinking about human incentives all wrong. I don't spend money today because it's going to be worth less tomorrow anyway. I spend to buy stuff I may (or may not) need and have a good life. That sentiment will not change just because money lying idle will grow. Bank deposits provide you the same function of growing your idle money but I don't see saving being influenced by it.

That is not how inflation works. Inflation comes from the majority of society having money instead of the rich having money. The working class and poor have more money velocity than the rich, hence they drive up prices by spending. The rich lose from inflation because money sitting idle is never going to grow. Which is why they invest. There's no society that works without debt at the moment. Someone below mentioned anarcho capitalism, which is a good example, but hardly realistic in today's world. Maybe a century or two down the line.

Sorry, I'm ignorant of btc trading as such. Are you being sarcastic? Because I'm still looking at btc as a better store of value than fiat currency the way the world is going and totally believed this jpy thing before some comment pointed out it's probably wrong. Also, what's the best published index for following crypto trading? 
@_date: 2016-05-04 18:54:09
1) Your differentiation of the spending habits of rich and poor people is completely intuitive. I didn't need to explain with that much depth for the same reason. 
2) however much the rich spend their money on purchasing normal products, the core cpi will *hardly* move if the wealth distribution skews towards the rich while it'll move a whole lot if the same distribution skews the other way. 
3) since money cannot be spent by the rich on normal products beyond a limit, they do have idle money lying around that could potentially devalue due to inflation which is why they invest. Ergo, my previous succinct point was correct. 
4) money directly sent to people will not help. It'll cause inflation but not growth. It's a long nuanced explanation I don't have the time for but I'll link later maybe. 
@_date: 2016-05-30 14:46:34
Nope. Why do you think I hang out here? I know how it's set up and what the concept is. But I didnt know halving day was coming up until I came here yesterday after a week. I know, but I don't know enough. And in finance, it's better to know more than needed than have inadequate knowledge. Something a majority of the people in my workplace do not understand.

They're holding cash. The sale of cash safes in Japan has gone up by a lot. Everyone is just keeping money at home instead of investing. Their deflationary cycle is just around the corner but the authorities can't accept that reality, of course. It's surprising to see them not resort to btc. It's probably the deference to authority as someone else mentioned.
