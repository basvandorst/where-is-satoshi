Serious question for Bitcoin faithful - BTC is unusable for me compared to the other coins. I agree that BCH has an arbitrary block size increase solution and no segwit, and I understand those arguments, but can you honestly say that btc is the best crypto in terms of tech and usability right now?
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:22:55
It's unusable right now. You are saying there is proposed technology that will make it usable later. Other coins already have the technology to be usable now, so why would Bitcoin be considered the best for having something later that is already solved now by other coins? I don't want to mention other coins by name because people get triggered af, but if I want to move coins between exchanges there are some very reliable ones that transfer fast and are relatively well established and decentralised.

I have some phrases that I want to try too. How can I go from phrase to checking balance programmatically? Are there any libraries that help with this? I managed to check mnemonics using a bip39 library but couldn't do more automatically.

The only alt-coins I personally have some faith in are ETH and LTC. The rest are risky as far as I am concerned. I am planning to do some trades on paper and test my ideas before doing anything. Day trading LTC seems feasible to me based on what I have observed. Maybe I am missing something?
@_date: 2017-09-06 13:00:16
I originally had the same thought, and my background is nearly identical to yours. As I kept eyeing the day to day volatility it felt like there was a missed opportunity from not diversifying a part of the total portfolio into a day trading regimen.

How does the class action show damages?
@_date: 2017-09-06 11:00:47
I am planning to do something like this as well. Feed altcoin profits into more BTC. It feels very viable. Do you have any tips?
@_date: 2017-10-17 14:20:49
I just moved mine to an exchange to sell. How long does an average transaction take these days? A day?

Noob question - do we know at this point whether or not there will be a new B2X currency for sure?
What is the likely outcome on its price? Is it likely that people are just going to dump it as soon as they can? What had happened with BCH? I am selling my BCH now, no idea whether it was better to do it earlier or now, I was a bit out of the loop when it happened.
I also sold a few BTC when we almost hit 6k, I want to buy them back soon. Will I get free B2X post segwit2x?
@_date: 2017-10-17 17:40:14
Yeah happened in an hour or two. Was reading somewhere else that the blocks are mined very slowly. Anyway, got my free money. Will there be a b2x currency too?

This is their donation wallet. According to this they have received 4k coins in donations. 
4k btc is about $22 million in today's value. Anyone know their other BTC wallet addresses?
Also here's their donate page. Highly encourage a donation, they do very good work, particularly over the last few years.

Let's say I bought $10 worth
it is now worth $5
So you want me to spend $10 for something that costs $5?
And this helps me how?

They publish whatever is leaked to them. You could make the same argument for all the other countries they haven't published against. Any wikileaks content incriminating Burkina Faso? Don't fall for the media rhetoric. They are all puppets. The emails exposed them for everyone to see.

I've been hearing that I should sell pre fork and buy it all back for less post fork. Is that likely to happen?
