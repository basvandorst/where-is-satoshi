Segwit (the different POW algo) is backwards compatible with all existing bitcoin clients. Increasing the block size to 2mb is not compatible with old bitcoin clients as they use a hard limit of 1mb. If a user doesn't update the client, the old client will label any 2mb block as invalid and ignore it, a new client however will accept it. This will result in a Network split, you end up with two blockchains. An old one and a new one, with the new one being the altcoin. So the bitcoin with 2mb block size is an altcoin by definition. That doesn't say anything about which one will be the most accepted one and which one will will be traded as "BTC". Future would tell how both would do in competition.
Segwit is a proposal to avoid such a network split by keeping the update compatible with older clients. Of course Core could implement the 2mb block size too but the problem would remain, old clients would not accept these 2mb blocks and the network would split.

Anything about the Intel Management Engine or AMD Platform Security Processor?
These are the co-processors that check the computer bios for it's integrity. They are not open source. They have access to all data (RAM,HDD,etc). If they have an vulnerability it means an attacker can do whatever he wants with your pc and you wouldn't even realise it because it works on bios level.

The Segwit proposal from Core doesn't split the network tho. In fact it's compatible with older versions.
