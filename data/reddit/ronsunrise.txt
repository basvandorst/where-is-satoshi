There are no fees, the exchange rate is slightly higher (less than 1%) what you might see on the exchanges. Usually it is on par with the Coinbase buy rate. It shouldn't make any difference when reporting taxes, you are still getting paid fiat from your employer, it just goes to an account that converts it to BTC. Of course if/when you spend the BTC that may be a taxable event depending on where you are.

hmm i don't recall needing to give the address of the payroll processor (just the name and website) but perhaps that changed. anyway, do you have any pay stubs that might say the name of the processor (ADP, etc)? ask your coworkers? if you work for a big company i'm guessing they probably use one of the big payroll companies. 
@_date: 2016-08-01 03:30:44
^ exactly this. you sign up and get a bank account number and routing, give it to your employer just like you would with any direct deposit. the best part is you get your BTC next day (paid friday BTC saturday)
source: i use bitwage. 
edit: i think there is also an option for employers to sign up and do all of their payroll through bitwage, but the above is much easier.

yes, we need mixing.

They think you are selling the BTC. 
It's bullshit that you have to prove it to them but they have to serve their masters.  
You could switch to Circle, I've been using them more lately and they never asked me what I was using the BTC for like Coinbase did.

Any age can get a wallet, just download one (do you research on bitcoin.org)  
Ways to obtain BTC:  
  
*  check localbitcoins.com and see if there are traders in your area  
*  if you have a checking account (and you're in the USA) try signing up at Circle or Coinbase  
*  check for any bitcoin ATMs in your area   
*  ask your parents or a friend over 18 to help you   
@_date: 2014-05-01 21:43:49
you can also set a recurring buy with the "recurring payments" feature. 
i've been using it to buy a certain amount of BTC every day this month. when BTC rallies, i turn it off for a few days. when it goes back down, i turn it on.

i can't remember, this was in 2011 when the price of BTC was probably $10-15. 
@_date: 2015-01-30 02:26:32
Monero already does this with OpenAlias. 
@_date: 2016-11-04 02:26:36
Once you have signed up for Bitwage you'll probably need to verify your information (I needed to scan my ID and such). Authy is just there for 2 factor authentication on your account - extra security.
Then they will give you bank account info that you provide to your employer for direct deposit. 
Bitwage has gotten even faster since I posted this review. They recently switched banks and I get BTC the same day of direct deposit, instead of the day after.

I've used Purse a handful of times and had no problems. The first few transactions I just went for a 8% discount, my last was for 20% and no trouble. 
@_date: 2015-07-28 22:07:29
I'm familiar with the origin of all these sayings except the BALLS one. Haha. Where did that come from? 
@_date: 2015-07-16 12:12:03
It is simply good for the network. 
However, there is an ongoing movement to give incentive to those running a full node, because the number has been dropping since the early days.
This site is giving $10 in BTC every week to a random node until the end of the year, or the network reaches 10,000 nodes.
@_date: 2015-07-08 12:24:52
I think you just have to wait, I have 2 transactions in the same boat (too low of a fee) and this has happened to me in the past. 
Since the transaction has been propagated to the network already, unfortunately you cannot repush the same transaction with higher fee. Why? Because nodes will not relay this transaction as it is seen as a double spend. 
@_date: 2015-07-29 20:56:35
Why? Maybe because they want BTC but they don't want to spend their Amazon money on goods. Just like when you look at localbitcoins rates, they are a good 10-20% higher than the exchange rate on Bitstamp. Now is that shady? No, I don't think so, it's the fair cost of exchanging your cash for BTC. 
@_date: 2015-07-16 14:22:49
If you're running a full node they can see it. However there is nothing in the protocol that says a particular node is connected with a certain BTC address.
The address verification thing is just if you wish to participate in possibly getting free BTC for running a node. 
@_date: 2015-07-18 01:54:22
I hear it is popular if you're into acquiring escorts and adult services.
@_date: 2015-07-28 22:19:11
If you have a Raspberry Pi 2 you can do this and run a full node, it helps the network. Do the right thing.

Why are you so angry? This is no scam. 
Sure, it seems there have been some bad actors in the past trying to abuse the system and Purse has responded with serious efforts to rectify that.  
@_date: 2015-07-31 02:25:27
I think someone or some entity is attacking Purse, honestly. I keep getting a spend order relisted because of 0 feedback buyers accepting my order, then not actually ordering the product. 
Purse eventually cancels the order on my behalf, returns my BTC from escrow and relists the order, but the process takes about 72 hours each time. This has happened 3 times in a row now.
The attackers must know that they are not going to get BTC out of this, but they do it anyway to disrupt people from using the site. I didn't have this problem until a few weeks ago.
@_date: 2015-07-15 17:36:01
My mom has been using Coinbase since early 2013, if your mom is already familiar with using Paypal then she should have no problem using Coinbase. 
They do have 2FA SMS authentication. They also have a very secure storage method called "Vault" which takes a 2 day withdrawal delay in the event she still gets hacked. My mom keeps 90% of her BTC in Coinbase vault and the rest in her regular Coinbase wallet. 
@_date: 2015-07-30 01:43:00

Yikes, I see. I've only used shapeshift a couple times. I would guess that they lock in the exchange rate at the time of your order, but I'm not sure. 
You may want to contact Shapeshift support and ask them.

Seems like you answered your own question! 
Just gradually buy BTC with the cash until you have used it up. Helps if you're in a dense area with lots of LBC sellers and/or bitcoin ATMs that don't KYC.

I say diversify. If you like Coinbase for its ease of use, keep a few coins there. Then keep a few coins on a hardware wallet. And if you want full control, keep a big chunk of your coins in cold storage with multiple redundant backups in different locations. Use BIP38.

They do pay out in one transaction. I received my payroll today and there were ~20 other outputs in the tx.
@_date: 2016-05-20 01:18:44
I understand you need to keep funds a secret so you are avoiding physical storage, but keep in mind the Trezor allows for multiple password protected wallets that nobody would know the existence of, even with access to your Trezor. 
For plausible deniability you can also keep a non-password protected wallet on the Trezor with a smaller amount of BTC in case of compromise. 
Then get a Cryptosteel and bury it somewhere

I had the same problem, had to use Mycelium wallet to restore from seed and then send my balance elsewhere. 
@_date: 2015-10-10 22:57:19
probably due to the malleability attacks going on now, someone is duplicating every transaction and changing the tx so it confuses blockchain info.

It does not have to be your entire salary (I only send a certain amount for each paycheck), they just give you a bank routing &amp; account number to deposit to and you can decide however much you want. That would be something you set up with your payroll service.

hey, i went to your bar the other night anyway and had a couple beers. paid with cash.  tried to imagine the best (fast) way it could work to pay in bitcoin, and not add too much friction on the bartender to collect payment.  had a few ideas.  if you want to talk in person i would be happy to come down to the bar and answer any question about bitcoin you might have.  
i have been using and learning about bitcoin for over 1 year and now i just want to help bring it to the next level of adoption.  even taught my mom how to use coinbase &amp; link it to her bank account so i can send her money.

sounds good, i will plan on coming by tomorrow or tuesday at 5.  i'll bring a couple devices loaded up with the coinbase &amp; bitpay apps (most familiar with those) and demonstrate exactly how the payment process could work.  
not familiar with the bips.me wallet mentioned here but i'll check that out too.

why not just print out some paper wallets and use cold storage?  much easier than worrying about keeping all that BTC on your computer
