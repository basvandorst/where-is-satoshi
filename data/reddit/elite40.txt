That $50 could quite easily become $100 in the next couple of years. So in that respect it's worth it. It's also possible that in 10 years that it could be worth $500-1000.
So yes it's worth it, you just aren't going to get rich of it.

The problem is people hate to be wrong, and even more so when they are told in such a direct manner. It just entrenches their stupid ignorant views.

Anyone who has been around for a while has seen this time and time again. The battle has already been won. Bitcoin is the defacto crypto currency of choice for investors looking for a place to store wealth. That is not going away. Sure there will be other cryptos but we aren't going to see a sudden switch to another competing currency.

Bitstamp have free SEPA deposits, but most UK banks charge a fee for SEPA payments around £10. And then 0.25% on a transaction.
You are better off buying through a broker like Bittyliciousor Coinfloor. Bank transfer to a UK broker.
You will pay slightly higher than the exchange rate but only a few % typically.

I actually did this the first time I used Electrum.
The documentation is really quite rubbish and it's not 100% clear that you only need to input the private key of the SOURCE wallet, the other input box is the DESTINATION. Seriously, they need a UX guy because whoever designed the UI has no business designing UI's.
I ended up losing about $20 in transaction fee's but lesson learned. I sweeped it again once it confirmed and its back in my Electrum wallet.

Same. So what's the difference? All investments requires caution. Otherwise I would have dropped my entire net worth into Bitcoin and rolled the dice on becoming a multi-millionaire within 5-10 years. But I haven't. Instead I'm aiming to bolster my retirement fund, but not rely on it.
The reason I'm optimistic is that there is simply too much money, too much effort and too many people involved in Bitcoin now to change the course and every day it grows and survives the position further solidifies.
Nokia lost market share because they failed to innovate. Along came the "smart phone" which was a paradime shift which every but Nokia saw coming. They failed to innovate and they lost.
Cryptocurrency was the paradime shift for digital money and Bitcoin was first. There isn't another paradime shift coming, just continual improvements and further layers to increase performance and ease of use. The fundamentals are absolutely solid which is why every other crypo currency is just a slightly different implementaton of the concept.

Step 1. Don't buy BCASH and instead keep your money in BTC and forget about mining.

What is interesting to me is that this idea started way back in 2013.... This is serious stuff which takes years to develop.

This is a retarded argument.
People who inherit wealth these days typically do so because they are immoral people, they may not even know it but when they profit off the backs of hard working people who get paid minimum wage or they profit through children manufacturing in the 3rd world.... then yes they are immoral people.
Most of the wealth in this world is held by people like this.... That's the sad fact. That's how they become that rich and that's how they stay rich.
The difference is when some random bitcoin nerd gets rich, he's just a average guy. I'd rather we created a bunch of average guy billionaires than the ones we have today.

People who enjoy the high risk of keeping large deposits of FIAT/Bitcoin across multiple exchanges.
The reason the spread is so high is because there isn't any arbitrage going on, if there was, that spread wouldn't be so high.
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:59:03
Well the second it forks you can have all your miners swoop in and make some cash before it's released to the public.

Don't invest what you cannot afford to lose. It's that simple.

Hold large amounts of BTC + FIAT across multiple exchanges.
Buy low, sell high. Balance your exchange accounts to ensure you maintain enough liquidity to take advantage of arbitrage.

There are multiple terms to describe this kind of thinking and rich people do it all the time.
They think because they have had some success that they are entitled to further success and believe they will continue to be sucessful when in fact success is often about luck than it is about time/effort/intelligence.

No offence but if you had any hope of understanding the specific problem you would already know you could check the Github page and see for yourself.

Market cap of gold is at 7 trillion. If Bitcoin replaced Gold it would be at around $400,000 per coin. The use for Bitcoin far outweight that of Gold. So it's not completely bat shit crazy to think we could see a million per coin.

It's happening, just not at any kind of volume. Otherwise the spread wouldn't be so big. Use your brain.

Right but like the Nokia analogy I don't think it holds up when talking about Bitcoin and nor does any other analogy in history. It's easy to bring up examples of things which failed but none of them are like Bitcoin.
We will see eventually, until then it's all a matter of opinion. I don't consider myself overly overconfident,  actually I've been pessimistic about Bitcoin for many years hence why I've not invested as much as I could have. However after nearly 7 years I'm more confident then I ever have been.

If I had to eat my left ball I would slow cook it on the BBQ for probably 10 hours until it's so soft and tender, then lather it up in a shit load of BBQ sauce. Then throw it in a massive burrito.
Will go down quite nicely I expect, at least from a taste perspective.

Liquidity of FIAT between exchanges and lack of market makers operating between the two exchanges.
In an ideal world you could move FIAT between exchanges quickly, meaning you could sell on GDAX and buy on BITTREX to make a quick $400..... however it's not that easy. It probably takes many days to withdraw from one and deposit into the other by which time the arbitrage opportunity has gone, or worse, has flipped.
Big market makers (those with large reserves of FIAT/Bitcoin) can operate across multiple exchange and take advantage of this kind of arbitrage which reduces the spread between exchanges however Bitcoin being relatively risky space, there is a HUGE risk for anyone keeping large amount of wealth spread across multiple exchanges so we just don't have those kind of market makers operating like other more stable markets.
So yeah....  That's the situation and that's why you see large spreads like that between exchanges.

Most of the population don't have a clue just how difficult Bitcoin is.
They just assume that  teenagers can build an app that it's really just a simple case of building a better Bitcoin.
And this goes for these 2bit developers too.... they think they can build a better bitcoin but they have no fucking clue about the serious business of cryptopgraphy.

There is no significance really. If you own 0.21 and the price doubles you have made a nice return.

It's not meant to be a personal attack. If someone has the first understanding about code they could check it on Github.
If you don't know anything about code then asking to see the code is somewhat redundant.

So what is your alternative? Given a fixed supply of Bitcoin there must be some incentive for miners to keep the network running. The fee market is a mechanism to balance the cost of running the network against those that which to use it. It's also a mechanism which prevents abuse of the network.
