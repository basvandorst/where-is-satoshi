I was always buying a Trezor directly from trezor.io .
What Ledger is doing by not sending the hardware directly is adding extra third parties, which the whole community is trying to minimize.
For me this is just one more reason to not advise buying Ledger to people. (In U.S. Amazon.com is probably acceptable, as the people who work there are tightly controlled...although too tightly to my taste).

That's true, system development is considered low level and low status as the biggest decision in a central bank is where the bail outs go, not how it's implemented. But for Bitcoin as there are no bailouts, implementation details are the only thing left :)

Satoshi Nakamoto:
Bitcoin open source implementation of P2P currency
2009-02-18 - Link
In this sense, it's more typical of a precious metal. Instead of the supply changing to keep the value the same, the supply is predetermined and the value changes. As the number of users grows, the value per coin increases. It has the potential for a positive feedback loop; as users increase, the value goes up, which could attract more users to take advantage of the increasing value.

Batching every 5 minutes is fine. No reason to wait an hour. Even if just 3 transactions are batched, it's a huge win.

Sounds great, so if this is used, most of the blockchain space will be used by all input public keys instead of signatures, so it's about 2x improvement in blockchain space, but validation time can be much less as computing the common public key is easy. How much do you think this can decrease fees in practice if used correctly?

It's funny that since I believe money won't be a problem for me when Bitcoin is adopted, and I'm not interested in a Lambo, I was thinking of the same thing: the only project I'm interested in is living forever.
Also I'm not sure if I prefer a Biotech startup instead of donating money to open source technology to move us closer to this goal.
One of the best projects that I see is the Human Genome Project-Write, which tries to make genome production 1000x cheaper in the next 5 years.

Gemini has the same problems, and Bitflyer is behind in UX.
Actually Gemini is worse right now, as it's using uncompressed keys.
It's hard to create a new exchange, and Coinbase is still much better than MtGox (it doesn't lose the money its holding, using multisig cold wallet). We need to work with the exchanges that we have.

The tech clearly proved itself at this point (it was much harder to get to $1/coin than the rest). The question at this point is only adoption time, and good, well organized centralized systems can help in that.
I believe Coinbase is a big net positive for Bitcoin even with its issues. It has a big focus on security of the stored funds, which is the most important part of running an exchange. But wouldn't it be better if they focused also on what other things are important for the users and the network?
@_date: 2018-01-09 15:56:21

Bitcoin is better than gold even without any innovation: it's P2P (I'd not accept gold from an unknown person as it's hard to verify), and cheap to transfer large amounts between continents, so arbitrage is much easier.

I know we worked hard and risking our own money, but I see Bitcoin as a special time in human history when there's an investment with unprecedented risk/reward ratio. This is just a short 15 years, and for most of the people who hear about Bitcoin for the first time, it's just a few years of time when they either have enough savings to buy Bitcoin from, or lose out (especially if they are children with no access to finance)

It will be much more centralized than mining itself, but as it's just a caching layer for the decentralized, secure store of value, you can always opt out for the cost of 1 BTC transaction (there's new research to bring that cost down, but I think it's far from being solved problem)

Sure, but I will never forget that they were distributing Segwit2x binaries as if it was Bitcoin core. Coinbase had some problems with understanding the value that the Bitcoin Core comminity provides, but they weren't scamming people

Thanks guys, it's amazing. I think Bitcoin's volatility is low enough to be used for payments, and the number of BTC owners increased a lot in the last few years, so I hope web sites will start to adopt it again.

Nice chart :)
Most of the money is given out as loans for buying stuff (stock buys on margin, morgage loans, and probably lots of other loans I don't know about). Low-value items are purposefully kept cheap by banking policy, as they are usually not keeping their value for long term.

I understand that a bug in one of the implementations doesn't bring the whole Lightning network down, but would you be comfortable storing all your Bitcoins using any of the 3 implementations when they're released? (Or lnd, as that's what your team is creating).
I ask this question because Bitcoin fees for a normal transaction can easily go up to $1000 in a year or 2, which means that some people will need to decide whether they store *all* their Bitcoins in a simple Bitcoin transaction or LN.
I understand that rolling out the system is important (and I love the LN spec, it's really well crafted), and integration test code can be shared between implementations, it just seems to me that a lot of very smart engineers' time is just not used efficiently at this point. Of course they must know this better :)
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:25:24
Most people buy and lose immediately after it. But it doesn't really matter. If Bitcoin takes over the world, expected value is millions per bitcoin. If not, your investment will go to 0. Put in some money that you're prepared to lose (right now), and wait 5 years. Don't worry about the next day/week/month.

I was thinking of situation like this, when a friend of mine was buying Ethereum and another IOTA.
A did a bit of extra research to explain them why I believe that the DAO hard for made properties of Ethereum decentralization weaker, and why hard forking is dangerous. But I didn't just simply say ,,sell all your Ethereum''.
With IOTA I was talking about cryptanalisys and how crucial is to know about it for a good security engineer. Generally I don't like advices without deep research and explanations.

I know it feels like it's over, but not. It's still early days in Bitcoin. You learned a lot with this.  I was in a similar situation to you, I thought I had secured my Bitcoin wallet perfectly, as I had my password in my head only. I forgot the password, and it was only because of my stupidity
I started to work hard and buy Bitcoin and secure it: this time I am using the Glacier protocol, even though it's just a small amount of money that I have. I still believe that in 10 years it will be my great retirement fund.
I'm also spending my time to understand more about securing my  bitcoins instead of just looking at the price &amp; Reddit.
I may lose again all my money (my friends still don't believe me), but I don't care. I'm prepared for the consequences.

They are very specific about writing that insurance covers online wallet, and deliberately don't talk about the offline insurance.
Brian said once that Coinbase thinks that it's worth putting more effort into security than insurance (which is a complete B.S., both are important and orthogonal in my view). The reality is that if they would have to pay a few % on insurance of the holding / year, they would need to pass the cost to users, which most users wouldn't like/understand.

Sounds great, the only problem for them will be that Bitcoin is much more liquid than gold because it can be transferred internationally very easily, so the price is getting harder to manipulate. I have thought a lot about why Bitcoin doesn't have long dips (MtGox dip was about 2 years long, it can happen again). The fact that lots of people own it (unlike gold where people buy ETF) and can transfer it internationally easily means that it's extra hard to manipulate the price compared to physical assets.

Hey Elizabeth,
I love how you're talking about Bitcoin and LN. You're great at explaining technology on high level. Also the whole team behind LN is awesome (although I'm not a fan of multiple implementations instead of all people working on the same and making sure that that one implementation is really well tested...I wish 1 of the 3 implementations would be selected by all of you guys)

Look how much money you had on the exchange and how much you got. For batched transactions fee should be very low, and most of the time it's free for you, as the exchange is smartly handling it.
If you really want to compute your fee look at the transaction fee and divide by the number of outputs.

They are. But it's not their fault. If you would use Bitstamp, you wouldn't see problem, as they use batching. Coinbase doesn't care about users losing money at all.

Good luck for them with their shorts and longs. The only problem that I see for people who don't buy directly BTC is that their risk for a margin call is much higher than with anything else they have experienced, as they're trying to tame a global liquid market (unlike gold, which is extremely hard to transfer between countries)

The main issue that I see is that they're using different programming languages, so they can't really share code even with the different approaches. 
Also the only difference between these appriaches are the transaction validation part, which is just a part of the protocol.
I'm not worries about others not following the protocol, more worried about losing money by what I'm running.
Would you trust any of the implementations enough to store all your money? Or all your Bitcoins?

Could you provide a way to create a private key seed using a 16 sided dice or 6 sided dice (and using the current input strategy that you have for TREZOR PIN input)?
I don't generally trust hardware random generators shipped by post (and this will be an even bigger problem over time as the incentive to hijack TREZORs is going to increase), but if I could use multiple ways to determine the private/public seed, I would trust TREZOR with bigger money (especially when multisig support and greenaddress.org support arrives)

I don't understand why anybody would have problem with Mike Hearn.

The question is:
- Did you use Windows? (which is the operating system for 99% of bitcoin malware)
- Are you sure that your password is not easy to guess if a wallet stealer steals your wallet?
- did you install a new operating system from scratch for yourself, so that you can be sure that there's no bitcoin virus on it?
- are you sure you wrote the password down well / will remember it?
I think trezor will help a lot to solve many of these problems, but storing bitcoins is still not a 100% solved problem. Also there's no insurance company that I would trust (Lloyds backed out, and also I'm not sure if I would trust them).
Also you were lucky, as you know that your situation (getting cheap bitcoins using localbitcoins) is rare.

Were you shot down by the users of the tracker community, or the leaders of that community? Leaders love authority position, and want to stay there. They love that other users will do anything to stay in there, and they love that they can create arbitrary rules. Decentralization is always bad for the leaders of any community. Also I don't know any tracker community that doesn't ask for donations, so there *is* money involved.
The popcorn-time team is afraid as well, and I can understand them. They like their position, and they are afraid to go farther (which is OK. I want to do everything legally as well).

The current transaction fee is 10bits (0.01mBTC), not 100bits. It was decreased about half years ago. The servers that need payment need to have good bandwidth, so that the paying peers don't need to open too many micropayment channels. As jav_rddt wrote, even with paying for 10 peers, the transaction fee is only 4 cents.
 Also there are very cheap providers of bandwidth, like this (0.5 cent/GB):

What you are doing is called security by obscurity. It may be good for you but doesn't scale. Trezor tries to be easy to use and secure at the same time.

Hey guys,
I was working on this concept in the past few days. If other people would be interested (escpecially Javascript developers), I think this could be a cool realistic project (much easier to realize than StorJ).
Bitcoin support for Bittorrent protocol is a way to compensate distributors for their work of hosting &amp; distributing files. It can be seen as something that Storj wants to be, but using Bitcoin &amp; Bittorrent (2 already widely used protocols). A Bittorrent node can ask money for transferring pieces of data, and another one can pay for it. A node can be a free downloader/free uploader/money earner/money payer at the same time. A micropayment channel is used for the transaction, which is similar to the Bittorrent tit-for-tat strategy. With this method, and current internet transfer fees, a video could be downloaded for less than 1 cent/Gigabyte, which could compete with youtube if people would pay 1 cent to see a video that doesn't have ads.

Thanks for writing back.
I see in the video that you use Java and are working on FrostWire. You should look at the BitcoinJ Micropayments library 
And also Lighthouse. And of course ask Mike Hearn, as I'm sure he will have some ideas for what kind of payment contract you should use. I also thing that the first distribution is quite important to get right, and maybe a multi-step crowdfunding (for every 10 minutes of the video) would be a right solution.
Still, I'm a bit more interested in Popcorn Time, as it's trending much more than any other bittorrent client, that's why I was using Javascript.

@_date: 2015-01-22 15:10:14

I believe that there will be fast hosts where you don't need 10 peers to download the data from if you pay for it. I guess the biggest problem can be spamming: you start a micropayment channel, the server doesn't serve the file or it serves the file slowly, it doesn't get any revenue, but you need to pay 2 transaction fees. One way to help is to measure the ping time &amp; downloading the torrent file itself, and the first piece. If it's slow, the client can disconnect without paying. Anyways, 4 cents Bitcoin transaction fee + 2 cent data transfer fee is still OK, but you're right, that 1 cent is the fee if things work well.

You don't need to buy parts of the file from 10 people, but it may be true that if you download the file from 3 people, you need maybe 10 cents or 20 cents in advance, which you get back after the payment channel is closed (which is 24 hours worst case right now)

It seems that the popcorn time developers don't want to get pay support for distributors until the big movie makers are on board, so I think the way to go is either to fork it and make sure that the videos that are shown are legal, or to work with content distributors, how ForstWire wants to do it.

I was just using payment channel between 2 parties, as I think the number of payers is going to be much bigger than the number of distributors, and this is simpler to implement.

Is it worth to pay 2 transaction fees instead of trusting a 3rd party not to double spend a small transaction? (the Greenaddress method). I believe that the Greenaddress method is good enough and practical enough, although it's interesting to know that using 2 transactions it could be improved.
This method can be really good for big transactions though...it would be interesting to know what instant big transactions can be used for.

“For the first time, there is a ledger that everybody can use, that nobody owns.  So, the reason that’s important is that if you think about what was really powerful in my youth about the internet was it was a network that everybody could use but nobody owned.  And what that ends up meaning was that […] the reason that everybody underestimated the internet when they first saw it, was that “It’s got no functionality, […] it’ll never be secured, blah blah blah.”  — But it was a network that nobody owned.  So even though, like the IBM networks and AT&amp;T’s network and Deutsche Telekom’s network, were radically more functional, every new entrepreneur developed on the Internet, because whatever they built, they got all the value for it, because nobody owned the network.”

If none of the miners will mine on the SegWit fork, I'll start mining with my CPU after the difficulty drops back :)
So I'll be able to sell my coins to the exchanges, and the current miners lose all the coins that they created (as the exchanges will only accept SegWit fork coins)
But what's more probably is that miners realize that the exchanges and wallets have the power and just conform.

The best voting for SegWit and against BU is to sell non-SegWit coins if there's an attack on SegWit soft-fork. So I would never lock my coins, as I want to be prepared to take action if the fork happens.

@_date: 2017-03-19 13:29:48
BU is not the biggest problem here but an attack on SegWit: SegWit is non-standard transaction in the old clients so the default core client (even the non-segwit one) wouldn't mine it, but a miner could modify the code to mine non-standard transactions that are accepted by old nodes but not accepted by SegWit nodes. The real question is whether the exchanges accept these transactions or consider it as an attack on SegWit.

Miners don't decide on the protocol. Users, exchanges and the economy decides.

The problem is that the public key is not only revealed in this case.
For example whenever a HD wallet is used (which is true for every modern wallet), even if it's readonly, the public key can be derived from the master public key, which is usually not as safe guarded than the master private key (or any private key). Current hardware wallets don't secure the master public keys for the accounts either.
Another problem is multisig: to create multisig address from multiple wallets, the public keys have to be transfered between the wallets (to be able to compute the redeem script), which makes it even harder to secure them.

Security of Bitcoin is not only about incentives. I'm sure there are people who would gladly pay 12.5 BTC to have a (temporary) inflation while shorting Bitcoin with leverage on an exchange. You have to think about the worst possible scenario and the smartest attacker. I'm actually not the person who categorized the CVE as high severity. Also there are still lots of vulnerable nodes on the Bitcoin network.
I want Bitcoin to succeed as much as you, I'm not trying to BS anybody. That's why being conservative is so important. We want a lot of features into Bitcoin, but constantly improving the security of the code base must always come first.

Infinite negative loop in the model sounds a bit fishy and too simplified.
There should be a maximum capacity on the edges as well (especially the negative ones), but as Edmonds-Karp uses always the shortest improving path on non-weighted edges, probably a combination of Edmonds-Karp and Bellman-Ford should work.
The problem to solve is not stated in the blogpost though, so it's hard to find a solution without knowing what to solve :)

I guess if you are on this Reddit and not r/btc, you didn't want the block size increase. Think about what was the main reason that you chose to not have one (for me it was verification latency in the Bitcoin blockchain).

It won't be over for Internet, as there's already lots of research into post-quantum crypto, but the larger signatures / slower verification effects Bitcoin more than other parts of the internet, as the decentralization of Bitcoin really depends on efficient signatures (another problem is signature aggregation that is not used outside the cryptocurrency space on the internet).

The most important thing is not the current price: make sure you use a hardware wallet (I prefer Trezor for it's philosophy) and write down your password, rent a bank safe for your backups.

Bitcoin not supporting quantum computing is not FUD, it's a serious issue.

I wanted to do it, actually that's why I bought a Ledger.
Ledger doesn't support showing the address on the hardware wallet in multisig mode, so I don't trust it, as I don't trust the Electrum code on the laptop showing the correct address. I looked at the code, and it was in very bad shape, caring more about BCash support than multisig support.
I also opened a GitHub issue half year ago. I was considering implementing it, but the dev team didn't respond to the issue since then (that's another reason why I was angry about those messages of buying new Ledger's instead of replying to my real problem):
I'm not sure about the current state of Trezor, but years ago when I had a question regarding it, slush answered my email in about an hour.

I thought that the nonces for ECDSA signatures can be deterministically derivated from the master private key and the transaction (though I didn't check), so I don't understand why a random generator is needed for that. This can't be done for MuSig as far as I understand from this blog post. 
Is there anything better than Trezor but still practical enough that you can suggest for securely storing Bitcoin?
I went through the glacier protocol, but it was a real mess to do it in real life (it took hours just to be able to run linux on the cheap new laptop that I bought for that purpose, I needed to find out the parameters that I could pass to the Linux kernel for example).
I also tried multisig between different hardware wallets, but Trezor was the only one supporting showing the address on the hardware wallet for multisig signing.
Anyways thanks for all the work you're doing!

The main damage was that people started flocking to altcoins, which is somewhat understandable, as it's extremely hard for a non-IT person to understand the security model of Bitcoin (especially why low validation and block propagation time is so important....even my very smart programmer colleagues didn't understand it when I was talking with them).

,,The biggest risk of LN implementation is people wanting to make larger transactions''
The hardest thing with accepting Bitcoin transactions is support: what you just said means that Lightning isn't ready for a public company to be used. Supports need to debug all cases and be able to charge back money in a scalable way. Don't look at when Lightning works, look at the edge cases. Also look at how much it improved in usability compared to half year ago, and how much easier it will be one year later for a big company to adopt it. 
In a year we'll probably have Watchtowers, AMP, Schnorr signatures, eltoo...all these things will make using Lightning so much easier for the end user. At the same time we'll probably have higher Bitcoin fees, which is still a risk in Lightning transactions and channels with low capacity, but the improvements will make up for the problems that high Bitcoin fees can create.
@_date: 2019-02-23 05:02:23
I agree with you, but it's not just about maintaining consensus (although I agree, that it's a necessary characteristic). If there's a serious bug in the Bitcoin implementation (for example digital signatures), and Bitcoin's value goes to 0, there's no way people will trust altcoins and put billions of dollars in them. It will probably move cryptocurrencies back by 30 years.
 This is why the  Bitcoin core team is so serious about not introducing a security flaw. There's no other cryptocurrency dev team that comes even close to the amount of testing Bitcoin core does.

Thanks, this sounds like a great direction!
One more thing that worries me regarding hardware wallets is that although the hardware wallet software mixes in the random seed that was generated by the computer, it doesn't prove to the computer that it is using the computer's seed as well to generate the master private key. It would be great if there was an easy way to prove it to the computer, but I believe the only secure way (not depending on the discrete logarithm problem) to do it would be to allow the user to reveal the original message that was hashed to create the master private key.

,,Tradition has it that one reason was the need to keep the number of satoshi within the limits of 64 bit double floating numbers with a small margin for multiplication/division rounding.
64 bit floating gives 52 bits of explicit storage. Interestingly 2 to the power of 51 is 2,251,799,813,685,248 units. This is just enough to store 21 million coins times 108 divisions.
Some languages, for example javascript, do all arithmetic as double floating point numbers, as satoshi would have known.

One metric is the number of successful hardforks: as long as there's a small group of people who can force rule changes on people who don't want any change in the current system of concensus, the system is centralized.

As I wrote before, this doesn't help for using multiple different wallets, as Trezor is the only one that implements ,,Show address on device''.
I wanted to implement it for Ledger, but I found out that the developer Slack is closed, I opened Github issue, but got no answer.
It seemed to me that for Ledger adding altcoins is more important than securely storing money on the device... Trezor already did the UX work, they just had to copy it, but they didn't (I appreciate though that the code base is very different).
@_date: 2019-02-18 21:14:56
Sounds interesting and scary at the same time.
From the implementation challenges it seems to me that for high value money storage it's better to not use MuSig for a few years.
 Even with a perfect library implementation, there are too many mistakes hardware wallet vendors can make.
At the same time for smaller values, like opening lightning channels, it's a much needed improvement.

Recieving SegWit and showing addresses is really important.
Sorry, but this is sloppy development, there's no excuse for not having full SegWit support and not responding for an issue like this. I won't use Ledger and recommend against it to other people.
If you look at all the open issues, things start getting clearer:
One of the responses is that they don't care about supporting the app because there will be a redisign in the future.   There was no redisign coming out since then.
Another bad sign is that there are no tests in the pull requests, which means that there will be new security bugs introduced without any way to catch them.
Most of the ,,BTC wallet'' changes are about BCash hard forking, this is for me unacceptable.

The main problem with somebody knowing how many Bitcoins you have, is that it's completely normal for the price of 1 BTC to go up to $100k, possibly even $1M in the future. You will become a target if you have at least 1 BTC and hodl it...so it's better if nobody knows if you have 1 BTC or not.

I decide if I want to sign a message that tells according to the Bitcoin protocol that I value (and that ģives miners incentives to order the transactions). I decide what service I want for you to give me in return, and you decide whether it's worth it for you or not. Miners decide whether they want to participate in mining for bitcoins on the protocol that I value highly or not. If they want to use their mining equipment to compute hash functions for blocks that are accaptable only for another protocol (Segwit2x), that's fine for me, but you can be sure I won't give any service in return for the Segwit2x coins that they mined.

Killing the European Project
By PAUL KRUGMAN
JULY 12, 2015
Suppose you consider Tsipras an incompetent twerp. Suppose you dearly want to see Syriza out of power. Suppose, even, that you welcome the prospect of pushing those annoying Greeks out of the euro.
Even if all of that is true, this Eurogroup list of demands is madness. The trending hashtag ThisIsACoup is exactly right. This goes beyond harsh into pure vindictiveness, complete destruction of national sovereignty, and no hope of relief. It is, presumably, meant to be an offer Greece can’t accept; but even so, it’s a grotesque betrayal of everything the European project was supposed to stand for.
Can anything pull Europe back from the brink? Word is that Mario Draghi is trying to reintroduce some sanity, that Hollande is finally showing a bit of the pushback against German morality-play economics that he so signally failed to supply in the past. But much of the damage has already been done. Who will ever trust Germany’s good intentions after this?
In a way, the economics have almost become secondary. But still, let’s be clear: what we’ve learned these past couple of weeks is that being a member of the eurozone means that the creditors can destroy your economy if you step out of line. This has no bearing at all on the underlying economics of austerity. It’s as true as ever that imposing harsh austerity without debt relief is a doomed policy no matter how willing the country is to accept suffering. And this in turn means that even a complete Greek capitulation would be a dead end.
Can Greece pull off a successful exit? Will Germany try to block a recovery? (Sorry, but that’s the kind of thing we must now ask.)
The European project — a project I have always praised and supported — has just been dealt a terrible, perhaps fatal blow. And whatever you think of Syriza, or Greece, it wasn’t the Greeks who did it.

Of course not, their business model involves lying, but not holding any of the forks they're creating. Their goal is to improve miner revenues, and any increase in miner centralization will inrease their share.
I'm not worried about S2X at all at this point, but Bitcoin will be a target of the governments in the next few years. Aren't you worried about a government sponsored constant 51% attack?
I don't see for example how a POW change can help, as the governments can afford to lose a few billion dollars per year, the competitors can't.

@_date: 2017-04-22 15:37:18
Does this mean that it's a compromise by allowing miners to produce non-segwit blocks and use ASIC boost, and we can hopefully get segwit from other miners in return?
In previous versions, getblocktemplate required segwit support from downstream
clients/miners once the feature activated on the network. In this version, it
now supports non-segwit clients even after activation, by removing all segwit
transactions from the returned block template. This allows non-segwit miners to
continue functioning correctly even after segwit has activated.
Due to the limitations in previous versions, getblocktemplate also recommended
non-segwit clients to not signal for the segwit version-bit. Since this is no
longer an issue, getblocktemplate now always recommends signalling segwit for
all miners. This is safe because ability to enforce the rule is the only
required criteria for safe activation, not actually producing segwit-enabled

Do it if you want stable jobs in the future. Start with web development, as that is the easiest to get job with. Later you can specialize easily. Learn Ruby on Rails with HTML, JS and SQL for example. Don't worry about which framework  you choose, just make sure thwre are enough small jobs in it. Programming gets easier as you get mor experience. It can f up your social life though, which you'll have to compensate for using the money you get.

This means that it is a soft fork, but old nodes are not able to create new calid transactions, which is dangerous.
All previous soft forks had this kind of backwards compatibility: you didn't need to upgrade to be able to spend your money.

He hasn't said anything like this (very wisely, it's very easy to upset somebody by comparing coins directly), the best proof of his focus changing more to Bitcoin and less to altcoins post-donation would be probably a statistical analysis of how much he talked about BTC/ETC/alts pre-donation and post-donation.

This is the most interesting part for me:
Studies also identify other characteristics of innovations, but these are not as common as the ones that Rogers lists above.[24] The fuzziness of the boundaries of the innovation can impact its adoption. Specifically, innovations with a small core and large periphery are easier to adopt.[25] Innovations that are less risky are easier to adopt as the potential loss from failed integration is lower.[26] Innovations that are disruptive to routine tasks, even when they bring a large relative advantage, might not be adopted because of added instability. Likewise, innovations that make tasks easier are likely to be adopted.[27] Closely related to relative complexity, knowledge requirements are the ability barrier to use presented by the difficulty to use the innovation. Even when there are high knowledge requirements, support from prior adopters or other sources can increase the chances for adoption.[28]

I love Bitcoin, but I see that it has limitations: the devs put security over everything else. This is a great thing, I love it. I don't want to lose my Bitcoins by a bug in the node. I don't want a 50% attack to be easy. But at the same time there are already better technologies available (like Bulletproofs, ring signatures, Mimblewimble, quantum computer proof digital signatures or even advanced form of ICOs) that will take many years to be securely integrated into Bitcoin and have some value (although less value than Bitcoin, the most conservative and secure blockchain). At this time the only way to use these features is to use an altcoin (which I'm not using, but I'm not totally opposed to these features, just see them as less important than security).

Of course not, but with fiat bail-out is also possible (although I know that bail-ins are getting fashionable nowdays). Also bank accounts are really critical part of the government infrastructure.

When a company stores Bitcoin (or actually anything) in custody, there's a risk of theft / loss. If you store gold for example, there are lot of solutions to insure it.
The biggest problem for Bitcoin for companies is that they would need billions of dollars of insurance for something which is practically a few years old (Bitcoin as a multi-billion dollar asset is very new, before that there wasn't that much institutional interest).
The fun part is that I don't mind this: I prefer Bitcoin to go to mainly retailers, not to a central bank / government. Now some of the retailers are assholes, but there are less and less assholes capable of buying up a significant (price-controlling) amount of Bitcoin.

One option would be having encrypted Bitcoins on the Bitcoin blockchain as well separately with peg in / peg out support. I don't see why this couldn't be added with a soft fork.

This is true, also Bitcoin is a store of value, Lightning network has to be much more mature to compete with USD in trading volume. The fun part is that as it's private, we won't even know exactly when it passes USD, but it's still a long way to go of course.

It doesn't compress the block, but it restricts the script inside segregated witnesses to a language that can be verified in O(n) time, unlike O(n^2) for the original Bitcoin script. So while it doesn't compress the blockchain, at least it decreases the verification time for the same amount of data, which is extremely important for full synchronization.
One good example is Ethereum: there's no Ethereum client that fully validates by default anymore, because it's too much time.

As I wrote, I think that the developers want to go for perfection (storing all money on either HW or not), but as coinjoin is always only a part of my money (I wouldn't trust all my money with a software on a laptop), a hybrid approach would cover my use cases. The most important thing would be not coin join for hadware wallets (which is tricky), but input labelling.
I'd like to pre-coin join all my money in baby steps and put back on my hardware wallet so I can spend the money when I need to.
Is a hybrid wallet out of question / totally wrong solution?

The cool thing about Bitcoin is that it works, and with 4% inflation it's so much better than fiat, that people don't need to understand it, they can just see it perform.
Also price volatility is decreasing, hardware wallets are available, which makes it accesible to more people than ever before.

I agree that volatility shouldn't be computed on a length that is shorter than a business cycle (and actually multiple cycles should be used, and only on the logarithm of price). Bitcoin has a different business cycle length than the stock market though: Bitcoin has 1-3 years cycles, while the stock market has 5-15 years cycles.
Generally stocks have lower volatility but much lower returns as well, which translates to much lower, which translates to a much lower Sharpe ratio.

If you store more than $2000 worth of Bitcoin, you should buy a hardware wallet.
As for mobile wallets, anything that's using BIP39 and trusted is good, like Mycelium, as you will have the seed that you can later use with other wallets if you need to. The problem with CoPay is that it's managed by BitPay, the company that's lying to users about Segwit2x. The most important thing to do is to wait after the fork, don't send money anywhere immediately. After some time (most probably from the start) the Core blockchain will be the longest anyways, it's easy to wait it out.

I'm really sorry, I respect your opinion, maybe I was not assuming, but hoping that you changed your mind. I think how Ethereum started was great, but since it got to be a multi-billion dollar project, I see the rate of continued new features instead of stabilizing the source code irresponsible. I don't have any problem with the difference of the two projects itself.
But when I looked at the multi-sig bug which I saw as a very serious problem (as I have significant amount of money in Bitcoin multi-sig, and I was happy that I didn't use Ethereum multi-sig), I was scared of Ethereum after I saw that the ,,fix'' was only a one-liner in the smart contract, without any testing added. I was working on much smaller impact projects than Ethereum, but if I made a mistake and fixed it, I always made sure that I add a test that catches that mistake. Another decision of Ethereum that I felt very irresponsible is that none of the Ethereum nodes are full-verifying by default anymore.
If you look at the most serious security issues with Bitcoin in the last year, I think one was a potential attack vector where somebody  could create a block which forces the client nodes to use 16GB of memory. When I saw the presentation as a big serious issue, I was laughing...I never ever in my life wrote code that was this stable.

Most people don't understand the value software engineers bring to products, as it's so far from the simple, repetitive tasks most people do in their lives.

There are 2 new technologies that can help in the next 1-2 years:
- Lightning network will make accepting Bitcoin payments much easier because of the low fees and instant, synchronous settlement. 
The lack of using Bitcoin as a payment network (and just using it as store of value) made its network effects weaker.
- Signature aggregation is the other tech that will make Bitcoin really interesting (and add an extra network effect): it will be worthwhile to batch transactions from different people together to lower network fees by aggregating signatures of different users (inputs). As this batching is interactive, the more users a network has, the lower the fees and waiting time can be, so it won't be that easy to replicate Bitcoin's network effect.

Both [conservatives and liberals] hold the same premise—the mind-body dichotomy—but choose opposite sides of this lethal fallacy.
The conservatives want freedom to act in the material realm; they tend to oppose government control of production, of industry, of trade, of business, of physical goods, of material wealth. But they advocate government control of man’s spirit, i.e., man’s consciousness; they advocate the State’s right to impose censorship, to determine moral values, to create and enforce a governmental establishment of morality, to rule the intellect. The liberals want freedom to act in the spiritual realm; they oppose censorship, they oppose government control of ideas, of the arts, of the press, of education (note their concern with “academic freedom”). But they advocate government control of material production, of business, of employment, of wages, of profits, of all physical property—they advocate it all the way down to total expropriation.
The conservatives see man as a body freely roaming the earth, building sand piles or factories—with an electronic computer inside his skull, controlled from Washington. The liberals see man as a soul freewheeling to the farthest reaches of the universe—but wearing chains from nose to toes when he crosses the street to buy a loaf of bread.
Yet it is the conservatives who are predominantly religionists, who proclaim the superiority of the soul over the body, who represent what I call the “mystics of spirit.” And it is the liberals who are predominantly materialists, who regard man as an aggregate of meat, and who represent what I call the “mystics of muscle.”
This is merely a paradox, not a contradiction: each camp wants to control the realm it regards as metaphysically important; each grants freedom only to the activities it despises. Observe that the conservatives insult and demean the rich or those who succeed in material production, regarding them as morally inferior—and that the liberals treat ideas as a cynical con game. “Control,” to both camps, means the power to rule by physical force. Neither camp holds freedom as a value. The conservatives want to rule man’s consciousness; the liberals, his body.

I saw all his videos (except the 1 hour loop, I got bored after 5 minutes :D ). Anyways the lion and the shark have equal power, and that talk was showing that the fact that it's much easier to write smart contracts in Ethereum gives it a huge advantage over Bitcoin in some regards. This sounds great when playing with toy money, but the question that matters is did Andreas move a big part of his own money to ETH now that it matters a lot? Lions and sharks have equal power, so if he really thinks that, it would be rational to split his money between the 2 currencies.
Still, with $1M he has to start realizing that for a cryptocurrency, stability and security is more important than the ability to run smart contracts (if the underlying system is buggy). You just have to read some Ethereum client release notes to see how many problems are with the implementations compared to the rock solid Bitcoin Core releases.

It's better to add 4 more questions if necessary, but add an error correction code for 4 mistakes.

Bitcoin will take over fiat.
Fiat would collapse anyways because the debt makes it impossible to not print exponentially more money over time. The stock market P/E ratio can't go to infinity, and stock buyback bubble has to blow up sometime, because yields will not stay at 0 forever.
If you have a currency with a small inflation (bitcoin inflation will halve in 2 years) and others with big inflation, people will choose small inflation.

There's no final solution for this, and there are many competing solutions. Bitcoin - unlike most software - is extremely hard to update while making sure that the devs don't make any mistake.

I already forgot my passphrase, although I constructed it to be easy enough to remember. I'm trying to brute force it, but the length of the passphrase is over 20 characters, and I used truecrypt algorithms. I wrote a program that constructs the password list to try, but even if I can try a few billion variations by using cuda to brute force it (which will probably take many days), it's not enough for such a long passphrase, as I don't know for example what special characters I added (that was simple enough at the time of creating the passphrase).

Even if Coinbase is not allowing direct payments to WikiLeaks, as long as they allow sending real bitcoin to private wallets, they are helping the ecosystem. The whole AML that they have is just a fake thing to show that they are acting like a good boy. The more Bitcoin is integrated with the current system, the faster it can take over.

I was speaking about this problem (multisig between different devices and companies) with a CEO of an exchange as well (I don't want to say his name of course), but he wasn't interested enough either. I'd feel more safe if multiple independent companies technology would hold my money, but right now I still trust my Trezor more than anything else.
The only thing I wished once is that I had 2 backups created after I lost the official one and removed my key from my wallet. It would be good to not be able to forget keys ever for me, I don't like that feature (I think sending money is actually safer than forgetting keys).

Actually money is a human invention, and there existed a time when you couldn't store wealth. When humans are not able to store wealth, they have much more incentive to go into wars and fights. I love Nick Szabo's article on this topic, called The Origins of Money:
I think the biggest problem with wealth that happens from inheriting is that wealth centralizes power (it's relatively cheap to lobby in politics compared to the money that you can extract if you are very rich without giving value to people). I think it's an extremely hard problem that may be partly solved with bigger digital Kickstarter  lobbying campaigns in the future, but I think it's too hard to know in what order inventions like this will happen.

The IsStandard() rules have been almost completely removed for P2SH

I agree with most of what you wrote, but I'm definately not happy when the price goes down, though I must accept that other people need more time to trust the technology, as it's new, and most people don't have the same technological knowledge as me. It took some time for me to be able to understand why Bitcoin doesn't have a market cap of trillions of dollars right now, when I think that the tech even in its current form is better than what central banks are doing.
The worst part was of course waiting years after the MtGox crash: I knew it's just temporary problem, but I also understood that it's hard for people to stomach half billion dollar loss, especially as there were no hardware wallets at that time. Still, the wait for people to gain trust again was painful, as I didn't know how many years we have to wait for it.

There was an Asian miner family business where the whole family comitted suicide if I recall correctly.
Remember: wealth doesn't disappear, it gets redistributed (right now to holders of hard money).

It can help moving BTC between exchanges that implement Lightning support for traders that make market between different exchanges.
The problem is that of course Coinbase just promised Lighning support, but it won't implement it for a long time.

The main reason I'm not into stocks in any direction is that the central banks can influence it with just a simple decision.
It's easy to influence Bitcoin as well, but as long as we hold our keys, just in one direction :)

,, trades at a 22% premium"' -
It's interesting to see that 1% of all BTC is bought with such a high premium. I see that just as an inefficiency in the current financial system.

This is not decentralized: you use a central server that is not secured by a blockchain (As opposed to running on ethereum decentralized machine)

This sounds great, but it's just not true. Anyways I've been through darker bear markets, this is one of the easiest so far. No exchanges robbed yet for example... Tether is still alive. It's crazy that even centralized systems got more secure over time.

What's even more crazy is why Bitstamp and Kraken refuse to make buying Bitcoin as simple as Coinbase. The real problem is not what Coinbase is doing. It's that it doesn't have any real competition.

The difference is that I had an exchange stolen all of my money, but this hasn't happened with any bank yet. Statistically banks are safer.

It looks a bit too simple. What about Greenaddress+Trezor multisig wallet where the Bitcoin Trezor keys are locked in a bank trezor as well (to be safe from losing the keys). 
I think the best key management practices are not yet available.

It's great, I'm all for rare metals. The fact that gold is not used in electronics is not a disadvantage though in my opinion. It was never used for that in a big amount as far as I know. Batteries and solar are the huge growth markets of course, but I don't know enough about them to invest.

It may be, but the real issue is the bond market bubble. It has to pop at some point. This may be just some noise, but the yield curve inversion is coming, which I believe will have big consequences, not just like how it was in 2008. Anyways as you have Bitcoin, you're hedged, so I'm not worried about you :)

Please stop calling me an idiot, it's not respectful. To tell you the truth, when BTC was going up from $190 to $2000, I was thinking of selling some of it, but I didn't. My BTC is worth 20x of when I bought it. My friends sold it much earlier, none of them made the ROI that I made. The main reason I didn't sell at 20k is that I didn't know when the crash was coming and how long it goes down. I'm not good at trading, so I'm holding.
@_date: 2018-12-28 20:42:43
You're writing about transaction signatures, I was answering to the question about proof of work, which uses SHA-256 hash function, not public key cryptography. Please read the Bitcoin whitepaper to understand the difference.

This was my favourite sentence:
,,More broadly, Stark is also widely credited for turning her friend Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter and co-founder of Square, into a lightning believer. ''
It's so important for CEOs of big companies to understand what the Bitcoin ecosystem can provide and what are the drawbacks. As they don't have time to understand the technology, somebody needs to explain it to them on a high level without making too many abstraction mistakes (but she still needs to make some simplifications).

This is bad advice!
Please use a hardware wallet (Trezor or Ledger Nano S) for over $1000 USD worth of Bitcoin. Under that amount even a Smartphone is more secure than a computer (except in special circumstances).

I can imagine that it's for them similar to us looking at Ethereum: I was actually quite frustrated about the Ethereum market cap getting close to Bitcoin's, especially as I knew much about Ethereum before the Eth genesis block and found it interesting (and didn't buy any).
I can imagine that Bitcoin makes gold bugs frustrated (especially when it will overtake gold in market cap, which can happen in less than 10 years)
@_date: 2018-12-30 03:24:10
That's great, I didn't know that. I also think it's ok to have a minimum, as I view Bitcoin layer 1 as a clearing network for large payments (and store of value of course)

I agree with you in the too much trust issue: I wish that the code would be more documented (BitcoinJ code base is much easier to understand). I would love if there would be a bigger effort in making the code base easier to understand for non-bitcoin-core programmers, but all I can do if I don't trust new code is to run an old version of the client, which works only if there's no hard fork (and soft fork makes it much harder as well).
@_date: 2018-12-25 02:59:31
As I wrote to another person as well, you're safe of course. But many people have all their money in stocks and real estate. For them the bond bubble popping will be a huge deal. Also many people will lose their jobs. Please try to be more empathetic to those people. We're all the lucky ones who found out how great Bitcoin is before other people.

Guys, this is not a theorical thing...don't think about jeans.
My friend is selling one of his flats right now so that he can buy bitcoins.
I know very rich people who have their money in flats. It's a little bit better than having all your money in fiat, but still..10-15%/year return is nothing compared to what bitcoin (and even gold/silver) can provide.

Bank accounts are much safer because bank transfers are traceable and reversable (not because it's harder to target a Mac).
It's just too easy to trick anybody to install a keylogger, it's not worth the risk.
Ifca keylogger is installed on your Mac and gets root privilages, it doesn't matter that it's in a vault anymore.
I don't know the risk, but I know a person who lost significant amount of Bitcoin because he wasn't using 2FA at an exchange and somebody broke into his computer remotely.

No, there's no historical precedence for what's happening.

Buy bitcoins with your salary, and get a good understanding of macroeconomics landscape.
Try to educate people (also your boss) inside the bank, but never be too pushy: if they don't care, just do your job to help the bank.

Bitcoin was designed in mind for people like your friends and family, that's why it's so genious. Don't look at them like greedy people: look at the money that they are spending as the money that they deserved and the money that the central bankers took away from them. I make sure that I educate all my friends about the long-term value of bitcoin as much as the volatility (I say that it will drop to 3rd or 4th of its value some time, but I can't tell exactly when).
Also, money only has value if you spend it some time.
Don't worry about looking like a fool: you will get much richer than them in a year. After that they will respect you much more (I've gone through this already)
@_date: 2013-12-09 22:15:34
I bought a lot of bitcoins at about $190 on average in the $266 days (I made it in multiple rounds because I didn't trust the exchange enough with all my money..I could have got it much cheaper in theory).
I was feeling strange the whole summer and September: my friends didn't believe in bitcoin, and I believed in it, but I still had to cut my spending just in case the price didn't go back. I bought even more bitcoins when the price went back to $200, and now I'm quite happy with my 4x earning :-)
I'm holding my bitcoins forever and plan to sell off about 10% of my bitcoins after it goes up another 5x, which shouldn't take more than half year.
