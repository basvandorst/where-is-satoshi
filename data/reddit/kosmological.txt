That is not at all what I said. I’m saying that we live in countries with government institutions and laws that regulate society. How these laws are enforced by these institutions is largely consistent and very predictable. Crypto is not outside the scope of these laws. They don’t just come and get you whenever they want. They come and get you when you violate the laws they are supposed to enforce. 
For example, the IRS is going to collect the taxes owed to it. To think that gains made off crypto were not taxable, or that you discovered some clever loophole that didn’t exist, only means that you are incredibly naive and oblivious to reality.
The same is true for the exchanges. To think that these large exchanges handling millions of dollars of other people’s money would be allowed to operate totally unregulated is really fucking stupid.
You can live in your own little bubble, thinking and believing whatever the hell you want. That doesn’t mean reality conforms to what you believe. If you don’t bother to question everything you think you know, to give an honest attempt at finding and understanding the truth, then be prepared for some rude awakenings.

Thinking investors will put money in bitcoin to “protect value” is pretty laughable. Bitcoin regularly swings by margins that would be considered an economic crash by conventional standards. It’s one of the least safe investments you can make.

You can’t keep bitcoins in banks *yet*.
Not all exchanges are equal.
The majority of people barely know how to work a computer. I don’t see how you can convince yourself they will willingly learn how to handle their own wallets and keys.
What you describe as “natural selection” is plainly antithetical to the basic tenants of a mainstream currency. If people cannot easily use it without compromising security then it’s not secure.

Eventually there will be only one bitcoin left. It would be worth trillions. Everyone will merely be buying and selling tiny fractions of it at a time. It would be the most secure asset on earth as no one would ever bother stealing it because no one could ever afford to buy it.
@_date: 2018-03-16 18:11:18
The proof of work protocol makes bitcoin the most secure digital asset. It is the gold standard of cryptos. Furthermore, the decentralized nature of these cryptos means you’ll never see any nationalized cryptos competing. Any nationalized or centralized crypto will not win against a decentralized crypto. It defeats the very purpose.
Look at any inflation adjusted chart of historic gold price since 1971 and you’ll see similar volatility, just on a larger timescale. Gold transactions are far, far slower and accessibility was limited. Bitcoin transactions are nearly instantaneous by comparison and is accessible to anyone on the globe with an internet connection. Naturally, it is more volatile because of the shear speed at which transactions can drive price up or down and the fact that the market for this digital asset is extremely immature. Gold has been around for thousands of years. Bitcoin is less than a decade old.
Golds material characteristics which make it useful in technology is not why it’s used as a store of value. It was valuable long before it ever had any practical use. It’s a precious metal which is scarce, does not corrode and is easy to melt down and reprocess. The scarcity and stability of this asset is what makes it a useful store of value. However, it has many drawbacks as well, the largest of which being it is an actual physical asset.
In more recent times, gold has been used as a hedge against economic and political stability. At its core, investment in gold is a bet against currencies. The issue is, in countries with political instability, where oppressive governments devalue their currencies and confiscate property, gold is not easily accessible and is not a secure asset. However, bitcoin is so long as they have an internet connection.
There is plenty of future for bitcoin. I don’t believe we have seen it’s true potential. Most of the world is still struggling to even understand it. To me, it seems bitcoin will always have value so long as their is economic and political uncertainty in the world.
@_date: 2018-03-20 17:18:54
I don’t believe there is much weight being placed on that by knowledgeable traders and the casuals probably aren’t paying enough attention or are too emotional for it to matter. For stocks, the deathcross matters because it’s hard for a company to reverse a downward trend since it’s backed by actual capitol, performance and revenue, so it does act as an indicator of sorts. However, bitcoin is free to fluctuate at the whim of the market so it shouldn’t matter.

Right! And one thing to note is that if the startup  fails to deliver or goes under, their coins are worthless. Bitcoin doesn’t have the same failure mechanism. It’s a different animal. This is not to say that bitcoin can’t or won’t fail. Just that ICOs vs BTC isn’t a meaningful comparison. But there are other alt coins which you can compare bitcoin to, like ethereum, litecoin, and some other alt coins.

@_date: 2018-03-17 23:05:33
You’re right. The exchange rate matters when you decide to sell. HODLers are not selling today so today’s exchange rate doesn’t matter. The exchange rate could be $100k when they decide to sell or it could be $1k but today’s rate is irrelevant. You only incur a loss or gain at the time of sale.
@_date: 2018-03-22 15:10:14
Right, so as it matures it will become properly valued and far more stable. In which case you won’t have to worry about capitol gains because it will no longer be treated as a speculative commodity with all the ups and downs that come with.
As of now, bitcoin isn’t ready to be used as a day-to-day currency so I wouldn’t bother using it as such. Just invest and hold for now. Holding helps it retain value and mature. Plus, you’re bound to make a good deal of money doing so.

Just FYI, I don’t believe a death cross is any indication of future market behavior. When you hit the death cross, that’s the moment you can officially say the market is officially down trending. That does not mean the downtrend will continue or accelerate. The trend can reverse at any time. The point being it doesn’t predict market behavior.

@_date: 2018-03-22 16:26:23
Yes, right now you do, which is why using BTC for transaction right now is stupid. Invest and hold. It’s not ready to be used for day-to-day transactions. By investing and holding, you help stabilize the market. If enough people invest, eventually it will become mature enough to be used as a currency.
When it’s mature, the IRS and/or Congress should recognize that it’s no longer a speculative commodity and reclassify it.
Using it for transaction now will not help BTC grow and mature. Investing and holding in BTC now will. Invest and hold. There is no reason to use it for transactions. You’re not helping BTC by using BTC debit cards or whatever.

@_date: 2018-03-15 15:38:52
I actually don’t think so. The crypto market is a chaotic system, like weather or the stock market. It’s easy to predict long term trends (it will go up) but short term fluctuations are pretty much impossible to predict. It’s the same reason why huge supercomputers are used to predict weather but can’t make any reliable predictions past a week or two ahead. However, supercomputers can reliably be used to predict long term climate trends. 
This is all because, in chaotic systems, small immeasurable perturbations can domino into large effects which dominate the system as a whole over the short term or be completely erased by mere random chance conditions. But over the long term, the law of averages applies which makes it much easier. This is why time in the market always beets timing the market.

Yep. This market is fundamentally irrational and chaotic. It’s inherently unpredictable, like the weather. Anyone who tells you anything with any amount of certainty can be immediately dismissed.

@_date: 2018-03-16 18:18:10
You’re comparing apples to oranges. An ICO is a tech startup that uses initial coin offerings as a means to raise funds from random people instead of venture capitalists.
The coin offerings they give you, in theory, can be redeemed for services provided by said start up at a later time. Speculators drive up the price, believing the services will be more valuable in the future than the cost of the coins today.
Bitcoin is a store of value commodity. It’s value comes from its decentralization, anonymity, scarcity, and security. It’s not a tech startup. Comparing ICOs to bitcoin is like comparing dot-com startups to gold.

@_date: 2018-03-17 23:36:17
I see your point but I still don’t think that’s meaningful. The exchange rate only matters at the time of sale (or purchase). The fact that 1 BTC is worth 0.05 lambos today doesn’t matter if I’m not planning to buy a lambo today. 
There is truth to both outlooks, that you can view the depreciation as an objective loss but, at the same time, if I sell later and make a gain, the fact that the asset was worth less at any point before the time of sale is irrelevant. I gain is a gain.
@_date: 2018-03-13 17:12:37
There’s a lot of bullshit among the crypto currency fan base. You’re right that bitcoin will never be widely adopted as a currency. It’s real world use case is it’s security, decentralization, and it’s mobility. So long as there is political and economic instability in the world, bitcoin will have value. It is essentially a bet against fiat currency. It is like investing in gold but far easier to move, secure, and keep out of the hands of governments.
Will bitcoin at some point shoot to $200k? $500k? Higher? Will it stagnate around $9-12k? Or will it crash further and never recover? No one knows at this point. Personally, I believe it’s most likely that it will continue to increase in value for quite awhile before it caps out. Even since the January crash, bitcoin is still up 645% since this time last year.
Right now seems like a great time to get into the market, as prices seem to have bottomed out at $9k. However, I’m only investing what I can afford to lose. I am not maxing credit cards or pulling from savings because this is essentially gambling.
@_date: 2018-03-25 17:15:51
The death cross is a metric that describes market behavior. The death cross does not predict market behavior. Once the 200/50 day moving averages cross, one can officially say that the market is in a downturn. However, this does not mean the downturn will continue, get worse, or reverse itself. This is just comparing moving averages. It is not some magic number that says anything about what the market will do. If it has any predictive power at all it’s because idiots use it as a predictor in which case it becomes a self fulfilling destiny.
In typical stocks that are backed by actual capitol and revenue, it has more meaning as its difficult to reverse a downward trend. So once you know it’s actually in a downturn (i.e. a death cross has occurred) you could expect that it will continue downward. However, bitcoin is entirely different. Prices are driven entirely by speculation which a slight breeze can swing to either extreme in an instant.

I believe you need to calculate how much the bitcoin you spent appreciated in value since you bought it and pay taxes on that. It is realized gains so you do have to pay taxes on it just as you would income.
If what you bought was priced in bitcoin, convert the BTC price to USD using market price at time of purchase. You are probably going to need to do it in a spreadsheet.

The exchange price is locked in the moment you buy so it doesn’t matter. It takes 3-5 days for your bank to process the wire transfer.

Another wave of speculative mania.
@_date: 2018-03-22 18:33:20
Short term speculative trading increases noise and volatility. Using BTC to purchase goods and services is effectively short term trading as vendors will simply sell the BTC immediately for fiat currency which they need to pay their employees, taxes, and effectively run their business. Selling BTC in such a low liquidity market drives down price. You can argue that this encourages more vendors to accept BTC but the fact is BTC is simply not ready to be used as a currency yet so these transactions harm BTC.
You first need stability before it can be used effectively as a currency. Without widespread adoption, you can’t have stability, thus it fails as a currency. People who believe it needs to be used as a currency before widespread adoption can happen are putting the cart before the horse. It must be invested in by the masses to find a stable price point and minimize volatility before it will be used as a currency.
@_date: 2018-03-16 14:25:57

Coinbase is insured like a normal bank. Crypto kids don't like it because it's too "mainstream," as in it's actually setup like a bank and is federally insured. This means that if they are hacked and they're bankrupted, your investment is guaranteed by the feds up to $250K, iirc. That amount of security comes from working with "the establishment," therefor the anti-establishment, conspiratorial crowd hates it mostly because it comes with it a certain level of accountability that is antithetical to the decentralized anonymize nature of crypto. As in, it makes money laundering and subversion more difficult and government surveillance easier. But that is all beside the fact that Coinbase is by far the safest exchange you can keep your investment and is arguably safer than a hardware wallet if you don't know what you're doing (which is 90+% of people invested in bitcoin). If you are a normal person who hasn't drank the extreme techno-libertarian cool-aid and just wants to try their hand, coinbase/gdax is where you should keep your investment and do your trading.
