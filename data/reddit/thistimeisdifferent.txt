If that occurs I will be sure to post about it, as I am sure others have before since the way you say it makes me believe it has happened before.  That would be completely unacceptable.

I watched as it fell and bought 9 coins at around 410 bucks each.  Minutes later they restricted coin purchases again - so hopefully it all goes well and I got lucky.

Hopefully people will realize the benefits.  Having a nearly fee-free transaction anywhere is amazing.

Lots of small purchases through local bitcoins probably

I have actually been in contact with and have been inquiring about their security and all.  He's been extremely helpful so far, so many props to Coinbase and Olaf in General.  
My concern with trusting it to a third party is what is my recourse if their website and all is compromised?  If I store it myself I can only blame myself for losing it - but I would hate to have my money snatched from somewhere else and I know I have no way to get it back.  I know coinbase keeps 90% of their coins offline, so does that mean I am assured at least a 90% refund if something happens to them?

There is a Coinbase App where you can set limit orders?  What's it called/how do I do that?  I have the CoinBase app itself but doesn't seem to let me put in an actual limit order.

Will do as soon as I get back home from work later today.

Don't tell her IMO, then, until you are ready.  Especially if she will never, ever know - if it wasn't money you MUTUALLY invested (that is, if it was from a hobby of yours like mining) then I would just do what I want with it and make the decisions and bring her in only if you are really ready to make that move.  If you put money in that you two earned together, then you owe it to her to let her have part in the decision making process.
I mean, sure she might be happy about having an extra 20k, but is that going to change your entire life?  No, it would be nice, but you couldn't retire.  I guess it really depends on your entire situation.  If you made 500 thousand - that amount could be considered life-changing for sure.

Here's a quick run down of what I did.  I am currently at work so I will update this later, unless someone will chime in and finish this up.
Step one:  Download UBUNTU 10.04  - it's the PC (Intel x86) desktop install link unless you have a more capable computer that can run 64 bit. - PSA I linked to the server install but you need the DESKTOP version 
Step two:  Install UBUNTU onto a USB flash drive OR CD
CD - 
USB - 
Step Three - Install Armory ONLINE WALLET on your ONLINE computer
Step Four - Download Armory UBUNTU Offline Bundle 
Step Five - Put OFFLINE Bundle onto USB stick
Step Six - Install the UBUNTU OS on the computer you wish to use as your offline wallet
Step Seven - Once you are logging in and have the OS installed, open up the OFFLINE UBUNTU ARMORY installer and run in terminal.  Then start it up.

Thanks a lot.  Do most people just transfer to Bitstamp?

Man I tried manual and automated both limit and market orders and I was getting slammed with so much lag last night.  From even that one experience I would not recommend it at all until they fix it.  If you need to really sell in case of a crash keep spamming it and I think you'll eventually get it but if you are looking for a specific pricepoint you are pretty much out of luck IMO unless you get lucky.

I am now having the same issue as well and sent an e-mail to support.  Support usually seems to take a very long time, though.
@_date: 2013-10-30 15:53:25
Ok?  Sorry I wasn't blessed with a bigger bankroll lol
@_date: 2013-11-12 17:58:54
Thanks!  This is what I wanted to include up top.
@_date: 2013-11-12 17:36:36
You do NOT need the password if u make a paper backup.  I did this last night and unlocked my wallet simply with the paper backup.
@_date: 2013-11-15 19:12:10
Same.  Bought 10 at $280... showed up worth much more yesterday.
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:20:35
Do NOT trust Gox with bots (if that's what you're doing).  They are facing extraordinary lag and orders in the heat of a run up or crash are getting severely delayed.  I would basically say any kind of heat-of-the-moment trading in those scenarios are ineffective unless you get lucky or have a lot of wiggle room.
edit:  This works for manual transactions too.

This is my first goal as well.. congratulations!   I hope to be as lucky as you some day, although I will need a bit over that amount as well.
@_date: 2013-11-05 16:59:38
Bro no one knows.  Chances are you may make some money, but there is the possibility of a correction as well and you lose money.

Looks kind of scammy
