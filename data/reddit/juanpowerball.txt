I've done something similar.  I gathered statistics for over 12000 horse races over the past year, analysed multiple different betting styles over that year and found one formula that returned $5900 over the year for a $1 bet placed 5500 times.  So thoeretically if I invest $50 for every bet over 5500 times throughout the year I should return $20K.
I've saved $500 cash and have been running it for two weeks, betting at $40 per bet and it has increased to $794 right now.  It is only half as high as it should be but that can happen with racing, next week i may be up twice as much and the following week down again.
It's also a nice rush every time a race qualifies for a bet.

In some ways you are right, if I increase my stake too much the influence will effect the odds.  However, most races have pools in excess of $10K and even the smallest are still no less than $7k so my $50 bet isn't going to have a great influence.  Unless I get beyond myself I shouldn't ge to that stage and if I do, I'll probably be happy with what I have done and maybe sell the formula or something.  At the moment the challenge is analysing every race within the last 10 seconds of betting time to see which qualify.  I've tried making some VBA code to do it automatically for me but am still debugging it.
I haven't used more than a year for my calculations but I have done it chronologically and it appears that for every four $1 bets placed you win 3, lose 1 and return $1.07 overall, and I think 12000 races is a good enough sample size.
Thanks for your thoughts, it has given me more to think about, and a few ideas of other factors I need to consider.
