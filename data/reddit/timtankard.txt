This is my new favorite piece of  bitcoin investing advice. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 04:15:23
You're so full of shit. Name one year in the entire history of institutionalized investing where a broad based index fund lost the entirety of its value.  Name one single example of a single market where this has occurred. 
@_date: 2014-11-16 13:03:24
lays it out pretty damn well.  It's pretty obvious where is from and who their "elite team" of programmers are.  Just a bunch of high school kids from Honolulu who scored big on bitcoin donations.

I've stopped feeding my children.  They still get their school lunch and can usually scrounge up food at friend's houses.  They'll thank me when the BTC price is $150,000.

Lol. Okay.  A stock isn't an equity.   It's a mythical security based on whatever MOST people think it is.   You're straight up full of shit and you're misleading desperate people by saying you used to be a stockbroker.  You're blatantly lying, you're equating fractional security ownership with casino gambling because they both have equivalent payouts.

And he could have either signed up for a DRIP and increased his holdings or used the dividends to buy fraction bitcoins or whatever.  
What's the yield on bitcoins?

So, sell bitcoins and get into gold and silver contracts?
@_date: 2014-02-26 03:51:46
It's like people are used to investing in something that is 'backed by the full faith and credit' of a third party.  Bitcoins aren't?
@_date: 2014-10-11 18:15:44
Instant buying with a cc and instant transfer to other wallets is pretty amazing.

It's almost as if the big players in the market are using their platform to influence the mood of the market.

Why on earth does Business Week have a deviant art account?
@_date: 2014-02-26 05:09:16
I'm not spoiling for a fight.  I'm saying you're being either a: disingenuous, b: naive, c: manipulative, or d: in denial.  It's simply unethical to claim that there are equivalent risks from investing in a fractional security and investing in an unregulated cryptocurrency. To say, as you did, that once you've invested 'it's gone' is a blatant falsehood.  Investing in an equity, be it an index fund or Uncle Pete's Pink Sheet confers fractional ownership, investing in a cryptocurrency confers a string of numbers which can, as we see here, be rendered worthless.

You don't think the stagnant price is causing 'negative Nancy's'?

Coinbase looking good?

These dumb fucks don't know I got a hot tip on Satoshi in the fourth.  If I put 10K worth of fiat on Satoshi to place I'll make my nut back.

No everyone is busy transferring their IRAs and their kid's college funds into margin accounts so they can raise the cash to buy on this 'dip'.

Oof, people were doing futures trading with Bitcoin?

Buy in May and don't go away.  Got it. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 14:39:50
You're talking about a hypothetical universal bank run (the situation in which the FDIC would be insolvent).  I'm showing you plenty of real world examples of how the FDIC assumes debt and protects depositors.   So you can be fearful of some global withdrawal possibility and continue holding your money in a completely unprotected and unregulated asset class or you can use examples and precedent to draw your own conclusions.

"My degree?  Qualifications?  I lost 25K on a cryptocurrency, I believe that's all the qualifications I need". 
@_date: 2015-01-14 20:16:48
It's just a psychological framework for understanding self-destructive behavior and paradoxical pleasure.   If you've really invested most of your net worth in bitcoin and you're still feeling good that's a way to understand it.

@_date: 2015-01-05 15:47:51
Do you not know how the FDIC works? The FDIC first insures each depositor then separately assumes the debt of a failed bank in order to broker a sale with favorable terms.  Returning debts and assets to the private sector is one of their main goals.

@_date: 2015-01-06 15:09:21
Just decentralize the banks duh.  Everyone start accepting fiat, paying interest, and burying the capital in some kind of cold storage hole.  It could even be insured through some Friendly Digging in Canada (FDIC) for new sources of fiat.  
@_date: 2014-12-16 04:13:34
I believe you missed a zero good sir.
It'll break *100,000*. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 14:29:06
Yeah, remember when the FDIC halted all bank withdrawals and deposits and all those investors and depositors got screwed?    
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:27:56
Jesus, if someone leveraged their stocks or moved the stock in their 401K in order to borrow money to buy bitcoin?  Fuck.  That would be disastrous. 
@_date: 2015-01-06 15:23:15
Try and dribble a dead cat while catching the falling knives and I'll be impressed. 
@_date: 2015-01-06 15:30:31
Not a thing. Seems to be self-destructing pretty well all by itself.

@_date: 2014-11-15 15:45:07
Fuck.  That's pretty damning.  
Edit:  this deserves separate posts in other subreddits. That's some damning evidence of clear malfeasance.
