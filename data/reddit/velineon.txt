Well you've broken rule 1.
Never reveal your wealth!

Ahhh I was thinking along the terms of it was shitty investment into BTC in terms of amount of $$$ invested or the timing of investment, which, I agree, could've been better.
Yeah I am going to sit on it for sure, and eventually keep reinvesting when I begin to learn more as time progresses.

Ill have to give it a look. Im currently waiting for CoinJar to process my ID verification, testing out different platforms and what they have to offer. 
Once thats through I'll sus that out. Allegedly it is a pretty good site for Australians.

Well tell me how to. 
You are like Warren, saying Bitcoin is a bubble (You dont know how to invest) but never actually explaining why. 
$200 is disposable. Tell me how the to properly invest the next $1000.

Yeah Coinbase was relatively high fee compared to others. 
Im still *E X T R E M E L Y* new to this, so is it possible to buy through a low fee BTC buying flatform then transfer those bitcoins to my current wallet on CoinBase (I agree, I have to set up another form of wallet asap). 
I mean if the 0.5% fee from Independant Reserve + transfer fee to my CoinBase comes out at less than what CoinBase' original fee was, that is the way to go?

Im still up 352%.
