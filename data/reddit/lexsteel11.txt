My understanding is that their data laws are to blame but I could be wrong. I’ve heard that any transactional data concerning Indian citizens needs to be stored on a physical server within the boundaries of the country, so if the Indian governments wants to subpoena the records, they legally can. This obviously is at odds with the concept of a distributed ledger. Maybe it’s something else but that’s what I’ve been reading

I mean income and property tax are pretty fucked up- even if I own my house and hold the deed to the land, I still have to pay thousands every year for the privilege to own it? Also with income tax- the gov prints money freely, distributes it, and then demands some back as an offering? Wtf?
I fully support abolishing all that and increasing the sales tax; whether you earn money legally or illegally, you’d be paying your taxes, and while inflation encourages you to spend, high sales tax encourages you not to spend frivolously.

Agreed to a point except for the fact that many of the super-wealthy are paid largely in equity and their returns are taxed at 15% capital gains, meanwhile the poor and less informed are paying their full tax bracket amount. 
As far as the infrastructure goes, ours has been neglected for decades, but even if they maintained it well- you should not have to pay for your own property in perpetuity; that is like paying the mafia for “protection” for your small business. The real quote from the founding fathers is “life, liberty, and the pursuit of property” and it was later changed to “happiness”, but the ability to own your own property outright was a founding principle in the US. 
Finally, with regards to the sales tax- if I’m poor and can only afford to spend $100 then a 6% sales tax would have me paying $6. If I can afford to spend $10,000 though then I’m paying $600 in tax. If I buy a Rolls Royce, I’m paying more in tax than someone buying a Camery, regardless if I earned my money legally or illegally, so criminals would also be paying their share.

I have the same issue with unemployment stat calculations in that they don’t account for people that have stopped looking for work or are under-employed. 
If there is a population of 100 people and 10 lose their jobs, there will be 10% unemployment reported. If at a later date, 5 of those people give up and looking for work and live off the system, 3 of them settle for jobs earning half of what they need to be earning, and 2 remain looking for work, unemployment will be reported at 2% and politicians will say “look! I decreased unemployment by 8%!”

Wow this was incredibly well laid out. Like I said I’m learning more constantly and it sounds like I need to educate myself more on the divergences between Keynesian economics and neoliberalism, but imo we have not totally abandoned the management of our monetary supply and how we measure successful growth as people spending instead of saving, etc. so our stats we use today still hold Keynes’ ideas for what a “healthy economy” is (and it is making us rapidly dig our own grave), but Reagan just expanded privatization a lot.

I mean the scariest thing to me is companies managing their own pci compliance and storing my credit card, ssn, etc in a central hackable server. 
Now, the most DYSTOPIAN data that they collect is when they scrape your emails/messages for calendar events, your relationship networks (when you get a phone call and your phone says “Maybe: Uncle Jerry”), and geolocation data. 
To be honest- I actually have zero problem personally with companies doing this all in an effort to send me ads relevant to my interests, rather than how the internet used to be a casserole of untargeted boner pill ads. What DOES scare me though is the government subpoenaing the data from the company; if you go to the Ann Frank house in Amsterdam (or you study WWII independently) they talk about how the Germans had such an easy time rounding up groups of people when they took Netherlands because the Dutch kept such extensive records on their population... it’s scary to have records exist that can be aggregated to form a complete picture of your life, relationships, and daily schedule, all exist in one place.

Never over-extend yourself. This will back you into a corner where you have to sell BTC during a dip to avoid putting money on a credit card. Been there a few years back. 
Also keep in mind that if you are in the US, the Fed is keeping rates artificially low; the market could continue to go up, but low rates means people can afford to secure higher loan amounts and that is reflected in house prices. If the economy goes into correction then house prices will plummet. Not trying to be doom-and-gloom but just remove your emotions of wanting to check off a life milestone of buying a house and make sure you are making the decision based on that you believe it is a smart financial decision at the right time in the market.

What I don’t understand is the altcoins that are supposedly specifically for insanely fast and scalable transactions, yet they have volatility. No one will ever use a volatile asset for daily transactions; CBDC shitcoins will be for that eventually, with the benefit being that you can quickly do an atomic swap if you want to use BTC for a purchase and a merchant only wants to accept a government backed stable coin. 
Paychecks and taxes will still be done in a sovereign government coin and corporate tax law will incentivize businesses to only use these gov coins.

Same. I honestly view money differently now. I contribute my max 401(k), pay all my bills, mortgage, and set aside everything I need for food/gas/entertainment til next check, and obviously maintain a rainy day fund, but the remainder just goes to bitcoin. Like it doesn’t even register with me anymore that that paper doesn’t have actual solid value and the longer I hold onto it the worse off I am. If I don’t need to use it in the immediate future but I don’t want to put it in something as illiquid as stock, it doesn’t cross my mind to keep it in usd.
@_date: 2019-07-24 02:03:37
The book “the bitcoin standard” makes some compelling arguments against your viewpoint here. Way too long of a viewpoint to condense here but it has to do with the cost of energy and time spent in mining new gold and verifying the real ness of bouillon vs the energy cost spent in BTC because that cost is what drives the security of the network. I recommend the read (I plowed through it on audible which I recommend)

I can’t speak for others on here, but that isn’t the issue- the intention of social security is awesome, but the second it was legislated into existence, politicians started “borrowing” from the funds for other projects and your money doesn’t actually exist when you turn 65, so they have to print more money and figure out how to pay out the least amount they are obligated to.

No, it won’t, but it might get shuffled around and be messy for a bit. Central banks will issue CBDC stable coins and payment systems, payroll software, accounting systems, etc. will evolve with the new payment type but we will still have fractional reserve banking and inflation driving economic growth and the boom/bust cycle will continue. But our money will have smart contracts and I think bitcoin will be a new form of more-liquid gold that we are all in early on, so that’s kinda neat.

What I’m saying is that the existence of data is a byproduct of any online interaction, and companies have an amoral responsibility to maximize the profits of their owners by studying that data to attract new customers and new revenue streams from existing customers, regardless of their business model. There are analysts at Pornhub that do an insanely entertaining job putting together their Insights blog, there are analysts at Walmart training AI algos to track shopper movements in stores to improve product placement for cross-selling, and Facebook studies how to maximize their consumers’ time spent engaged in their website. No matter what the business is, there is someone studying your behavior.

Eh- I agree, but counter-point: regulation and infrastructure for de-anonymizing transactions is foundational for the continued survival of any nation. If rich people start parking their money in cryptos that are completely anonymous, I think the tax infrastructure would crumble and all our physical infrastructure supported by those taxes would be unsustainable, which would lead to a needed increase in global tariffs and domestic sales tax.

I thought the patent was on a method of using a rapid working private blockchain for instant verification before transferring the transaction to the public blockchain, thus transferring risk from the merchant to the processor, where the processor can centralize efforts to crush bugs and improve processes leading to a more positive user (merchant) experience in order to drive adoption.

Idk about Europe but in the US there is uncertainty still around what crypto is classified as (currency, commodity, etc.) depending on the coin and therefore the tax implications on the company is open for interpretation. Now add the lack of crypto support from mainstream payroll softwares such as ADP and Paycor, and you have a recipe for unwillingness on the part of large companies adopting crypto payroll in the near term. I think we will get there, but I think there are a lot of best practices to sort out first, and demand isn’t large enough yet for companies to waste time on figuring it out.

In reality most people do not want to handle the responsibility of their own banking security because they know they will mess up somehow.

It’s funny when I see the whole “the banks will be killed by crypto!” sentiment on here. If bitcoin does in fact proliferate into the mainstream, there is 0% chance that you don’t see banks evolve to  control accounts and provide custodial protection at a cost, and  create their own bitcoin fork for lending (lets call it USC for “United States coin”) so they can maintain fractional reserve banking practices. They aren’t going anywhere, and as long as these lending practices continue, we will continue to see lending practices lead to economic bubbles
@_date: 2019-03-29 15:54:29
Not to mention besides inflation, there are items today that are not necessarily “need-to-haves” like personal computers, smart phones, etc. that you kind of are required to have and pay to upgrade every couple years that didn’t exist 30 years ago but none of our pay was adjusted to account for these things. Then the subscription model proliferated where everything is going to the cloud and tech companies will nickel and dime you to death if you aren’t careful- access your photos on the cloud? $2/month. Netflix or Hulu to replace cable since it’s so expensive? $12/month each, but you probably bundle cable &amp; internet so your internet will get more expensive. You get the point; cost of living has shifted a lot, which just piles on this problem more.

I mean... I agree with that to an extent. I missed selling at the last ATH (and timing it just right is impossible) but I do wish in hindsight that I could have seen that the parabolic growth was unsustainable and parked my profits on the sideline to buy back at a discount. My portfolio at the 2017 height was worth $8,500 for roughly $600 invested, and now I am at $3,500 invested but I do wish I could have parked at least $4,000 in profit on the side and then bought more after the retracement. I don’t think that doing something like that would make you a “non-believer” any more than someone who sells their shares of Microsoft stock doesn’t necessarily not believe in the company any more, they are just making a pragmatic investment decision. 
@_date: 2019-03-29 20:20:43
I don’t disagree, which is why I haven’t sold anything, society IMO will never one state on BTC because it is deflationary, but I think stable coins will be used for daily transacting and vehicles like BTC as a long term store of value you can swap in and out of to preserve value. In my mind that is the inevitable future so it’s no different than selling now, but we all have the right to our own opinion
@_date: 2019-03-29 13:49:01
I love your optimistic use of the past tense on fractional reserve banking... haha I wish that didn’t still exist but it’s a weapon in the economic arms race; the US wants to stay ahead of rivals like China and Russia, so they need to use tools like inflation and fractional banking to encourage economic growth, and they won’t ever stop doing it no matter how many times we get burned, because if they stop it, other countries that don’t stop could pull ahead.

And not that you implied this- I don’t think the bitcoin network is ready for that yet but it will get there. IMO 10 years from now all transactions will be done with digital CBDC stable coins in each country. There will be services like shapeshift where you will be able to land in another country and for pennies just swap your coins with the local currency. 
Second, I think we will see the tokenization of securities like stocks/bonds and they will be almost as liquid as cash and will live alongside the likes of bitcoin in your phone’s wallet. When you want to pay a merchant, if you see you are short on fiat you can quickly swap some Tesla stock tokens for the local currency or if BTC pumped the night before you can use some of that. 
I personally don’t believe daily transactions will ever be done in bitcoin unless suddenly all payroll was paid out in bitcoin, but it will have its place.

Ok so I’ve been wanting to ask about this as I’m not familiar with every new development with blockchain tech- 
“Blockchain but not cryptocurrency” that every banking giant and CEO keeps saying doesn’t make sense to me even on a surface level. Whether you validate even non-financial data transactions through POW or POS, there still has to be some sort of monetary reward given during those processes, right? 
Otherwise what incentive would anyone have to lend their computing power to support a decentralized network if there is no mining reward or node operator fee given?

I did the vpn route and have about 2 TB of content on an external hard drive on a home sharing network, but luckily things have gone well with work and now make enough that I can’t justify not paying for it, but I definitely am not against torrenting. As far as use goes- personally I need a powerful setup because my job requires me pulling down massive data sets and doing analytic work through Python, R, and Tableau, and even with a powerful machine I find myself sitting and waiting a lot (and being on this subreddit haha). As far as cable goes, in my area you can bundle with cable for $85/month (internet being $35 of it) but if you want internet only, it’s $75/ month which is pointless once you add Hulu.
That’s just my use, but my point is simply just that there are more costs in life today than there was 30 years ago.

Personally I think every central bank will have their own CBDC and all smart phones will have crypto wallets that will allow you to swap any coin for whatever local CBDC currency a vendor accepts prior to making a transaction (kind of like reloading and paying with the Starbucks app now) and bitcoin will be a store of value not used in every day transactions, but if it’s super up on a given day, you may want to use it or just keep holding

It means that if we ever default it’s not like China would just plant their flag on our soil like if your house was foreclosed on. 
Also we have gotten very used to the word “sanctions” on our enemies, and people don’t seem to realize that it is an economic siege where we are starving out their population of resources until their leadership capitulates to the will of the US and our allies go along with us because of how powerful of a military ally we are and they want to stay on our good side. 
I don’t like the military industrial complex and wasteful spending, but we are kidding ourselves if we think our paper money would have any value on the world stage if we weren’t so terrifying to face. Every time a country has tried to use their own peg for oil pricing and trade, we essentially wage economic warfare on them (and sometimes real warfare) until the leader is replaced.

Correct me if I’m wrong, but isn’t roughly $6,000 the current break-even point for miners (obviously electric cost is variable though) with the current difficulty for validating transactions?

I keep all my crypto in cold storage but even then, the second you connect to your computer you are taking the risk that your computer hasn’t been infected with a program created to steal private keys once you log into your Trezor/ledger, etc. so you are taking a trust fall that those companies are properly encrypting everything. 
I don’t disagree with you that there are soooo many security concerns in a trustless system (if it was easy replacing banks then someone would have done it already!) and we are just in the infancy of crypto, but I do believe that all the current risks lie in your device or exchange being hacked, not someone hacking your accounts directly from the blockchain.

I mean I think having a currency that is programmable for smart contracts would be a huge deal. Right now the USD is the reserve currency for oil and other commodities, and that allows us to lay economic siege to our enemies via sanctions to starve them out until they bend to the will of US policy, so whichever country controls the world reserve currency holds an insane amount of power. 
If China could create a digital currency that could execute international trading of commodities without all the expensive infrastructure and manual human intervention that goes into that now, they could very quickly take that power from the US.

All these ATM’s are starting to be forced to enforce KYC. If avoiding taxes is your motivation, better do it now while you can otherwise just use an exchange then send to an address I associate with you and then use a mixing service to send to an ultimate address for storage. I’ve never done it but that’s how I’ve been told to avoid it. 
That being said, if the amount of BTC I hold ends up being able to pay off my house some day, I’m going to need to be able to tell the IRS where I got the $300k from and at that point I’ll have held long enough for capital gains to be 15% long term. To each their own on their goals.

I’d like to see a link please stating that they will not be using these companies to secure their ledgers. If there was no symbiosis with these initial Libra consortium partners then the initial investors putting in $10M each would just be a list of billionaires you’ve never heard of. But it’s not, it’s a list of people who would benefit and be able to help facilitate the network in their own ways: Visa and MasterCard? See the link below for how they probably threw their dick on the table in the initial meetings. Uber? Immediate legitimacy for spending Libra not on facebook’s platform and they in turn save 2.5% annually from paying their drivers in Libra and allowing passengers to pay with it. Coinbase?

Yeah after reading The Bitcoin Standard it scared me that it’s basically like “bitcoin is secure because it would require such a large investment, it would make it economically too impractical to try and devalue all the hardware you invested to control enough mining power to launch the attack”... oh you mean like a zero-sum game where the point is to defend the USD dominance?
It also talked about how the computing power that payment processors like MasterCard and Visa have in giant compounds where they keep the most powerful servers in the world verifying their ledgers. Couldn’t the US theoretically under an over-reaching president be forced to join power via some fucked up court order to launch their computers at attacking the bitcoin network in unison? That probably isn’t likely but is scary.

No I agree with you. I think banks will hoard digital assets and create “forks” of sorts to create a new type of fractional reserve banking. Central Bank Digital Currencies will become the new dollars but will have the ability to carry out smart contracts. 
The future I see is one where your digital wallet receives your paycheck in CBDC’s but you also have wallets like bitcoin. If you are in line to pay for your groceries and are short on CBDC’s and bitcoin is up today, you quickly swap some BTC for the coin of the local market and the cashier still receives a sort of fiat currency, none the wiser you used bitcoin.

@_date: 2019-08-22 13:31:54
Ok I’m always curious to hear people’s reasoning when they say this about CBDC projects and things like Libra. 
IMO if it’s a cryptographically secured digital asset that has processes in place to remove concern of double spending of tokens, etc. and the network keeps people from “counterfeiting” the tokens, then it is a cryptocurrency. 
Libra, for example is a centralized cryptocurrency that is using payment processor partners’ insane server farms (Visa and Mastercard) to supply the processing power needed to keep the network “secure” (I put quotes on that because even though it works in theory, I guarantee it will get hacked) and validate transactions. Bitcoin does this through decentralized POW, but it is just 2 approaches to the same end goal (not an equal outcome though). 
To be clear, I wouldn’t keep my money in any of these centralized shitcoins and prefer BTC, but to say these are not crypto currencies is incorrect in my opinion.
@_date: 2019-08-15 11:13:08

100%. And to each their own on what they choose to keep their hard earned wealth in and congrats to them for being at least in the small part of the population that understands fiat for what it really is, and I wish everyone in this space the best of luck and fortune. 
But if even tomorrow Chucky Fuckin’ Cheese announces they were creating a distributed ledger among the computers in their broach and mortar stores to validate transactions and control supply of their video game tokens, even though the spending ability would be confined to their establishment, it could still be a cryptocurrency depending on other criteria being met as well. “oh I’m in China and can spend my tokens from my phone on their video games even at the Shanghai location from when I converted fiat back in Ohio?” That’s a crypto my friend.

Yeah this argument is funny to me- the justification that gold is priced due to usefulness. Like, yeah it doesn’t corrode in the air, it can go into electronics, and you can make jewelry out of it, but he use as a store of value and speculation is why it is $1400 an ounce. I could see a justification in the hundreds of it wasn’t popular for that
@_date: 2018-06-15 10:39:00
Eh- granted I don’t know much about it but if 51% attacks really are a threat, given that 1% of our population has the majority of the money in the world (crypto will not change that although it may momentarily complicate things), wouldn’t that make crypto very vulnerable to attack?
@_date: 2019-08-15 01:26:09
Right I think I’m not saying this right haha- I don’t think it will be the currency people use for everyday transactions but I think it will act as a more liquid form of gold as a store of value. 
People do not want the responsibility of carrying around their own wealth. That’s why banks exist and will continue to exist. Yes it is against why bitcoin was designed for, but in my experience seeing how human beings address these kinds of problems, they will create a system where you store your private keys with banks and you are given tokenized IOU’s that are also regulated in supply by a central bank. I’m not saying this is what I want to happen, but I think it’s most likely.

Right- but my point is that everything is proportional; bitcoin for instance might be big enough that no one would profit from attacking it because to the investment that would imply, but once it grows big enough to threaten mega-billionaires or foreign governments? Bad actors at that level could probably mount an attack on a large chain, right?

You’re saying it can’t be readily exchanged for cash through an exchange instantly, right? And you’re citing that for bitcoin itself having a lack of liquidity? Unless I’m misunderstanding your point, the issue is with the waiting time imposed by the intermediary to withdraw your funds, just like if you used Venmo and didn’t pay the fee for instant transfer, which doesn’t make the fiat being exchanged any less liquid itself.

Nothing that you just said backed up the opinion of why you would not define them as a “Cryptocurrency”. You laid out reasons why it won’t work/be adopted and I agree with you, but my point is that while it is a shitcoin that won’t work, it is still a cryptocurrency by definition.
@_date: 2019-08-22 15:57:10
You are projecting the ideals of bitcoin and why it is a superior money; 99% of the crypto currencies out there are centralized, not censor-resistant, etc. and we still allow them to be called crypto currencies. 
I’m 100% on the BTC train but I don’t think that “cryptocurrency” is a misnomer of the Chinese CBDC from my understanding of it. Now, if we as a community wanted to designate bitcoin and anything that operates the same(ish) as it as a “cryptocurrency” and the rest as “digital assets” I’m on board with that, but if a lot of the projects out there are designated as “crypto currencies” then this is too.

Except when you consider the divisibility of bitcoin- I wonder how long till you start seeing people state things in how many Sats it costs instead of 0.0000234 BTC. 
So by that logic- BTC at $1,000,000 would mean the conversion from USD to a Sat is $0.01. So there will be psychological barriers, sure- but it’s not the same as Amazon’s stock price hitting $1M since you have to buy one whole unit at a time. Crypto I don’t think will abide by classical economic laws

I think it will plummet along with the dollar, but then will act as a parachute- after a certain point of inflation, people will start jumping ship into other assets. That being said, since the US is the standard currency for oil, I would be surprised if this didn’t end in war, but I think the culmination of all this may hurt bitcoin, but not nearly as much as it will hurt fiat currency, so it’s all about perspective

I’m writing a pitch to my COO on accepting BTC, ETH, and LTC at first (the pitch being it would give us free publicity for being a big brand accepting it- also to be clear I report directly to him so this isn’t a moonshot here) but I know they will not want to hold coins due to volatility paranoia. However, everything I’m reading makes it sound like there is really no cheap way to get the fees down when withdrawing to fiat.
Our current cc processing fees avg out to 2.2%. It seems like CoinPayments has 1.5% fees but then there are fiat conversion fees if I’m understanding correctly, that end up making it more expensive (for now!)?  Does anyone have any insight into how you can choose services that get this fee lower so I can strengthen my argument?
@_date: 2019-08-15 11:18:29
I kind of agree in that crypto currencies in general are superior to fiat, especially once smart contracts have their “Netscape moment” but it’s not just an old technology and a newer one; the older technology protects people from fraud, losing their passwords, etc. 
Banks exist for many reasons but the incentive people have for using them is easy(ish) access to your money and for a 3rd party to absorb your risks, in return for fees. I don’t see demand for that second part going away even if a new technology like bitcoin renders the first part irrelevant.

I mean... this IS probably bullshit, but I don’t think it would be unreasonable to think whoever funded that many miners could also afford to bring in people who are experts in mining operations from another country to set it up...
Even if this is fake- I’ve said in other comment threads I believe that the “bitcoin standard” maximalist future, IF it is to happen, will happen because the USD slides from power as a global reserve currency and we will all find out Iran, DPRK, etc. have been surviving under sanctions by hacking exchanges and mining, and once bitcoin hits $100k their economic stature in the world will change to the point that the US, Russia, China, etc. will get in arms-race mode and start stockpiling crypto themselves, causing “hyperbitcoinization” and collapsing fiat currencies. It super might not happen, but if it does, this is the narrative I’m predicting.

I will say I need to educate myself more on nuances of the law (hopefully it’s a problem we all have to look into in the future haha) but I’ve never converted back to usd for more than a $1,000 gain in a given year. Generally the tax authorities won’t come after you for income under $10,000 but it’s not smart to bet on it. I just am paranoid and keep a lot of records for when I do need to report but I’ve been in accumulation mode the last 2 years. If anything, I lost money on cardano and Stellar, but only cashed out of stellar. Still hodling ADA But am growing weary over how the project is coming. Wish I converted all of it to BTC in early stages of the bear market (well, if I’m able to be Captain Hindsight I wish I would have cashed out and sidelined everything in 2017 and bought back in Dec 2018, but so does everyone haha)

Thanks- it was pulled fresh out of my ass haha but the more I learn about bitcoin (still learning more everyday) the more I realize it’s an asset backed by human greed rather than a government, and that’s insanely powerful. 
Price goes up, more people start mining due to the amount of money to be made, and the hashrate adjusts to drive mining profitability down. As people shut their miners down due to cost, hashrate will re-adjust to make it profitable again, meanwhile increasing adoption drives demand that is then accounted for by cutting the inflation rate in half to restrict supply.... lather, rinse, repeat. It’s incentivization manipulating human behavior internally in the network/community, and then people on the outside have FOMO to jump in and further increase the value. It’s like a perfectly engineered Chinese finger trap for the fiat money system we have found ourselves with. Once it starts affecting governments, the fun will start.

I do agree with you on a the most base level that it’s equivalent to reading tea leaves, but I do think TA is a useful guide of when to buy/sell because of how much money in the market trades on algorithms that operate on TA indicators.

If you hold an asset for &gt; 1 year in the US, you are only subject to capital gains tax which is around 15% vs my normal tax rate of 30% if you turn a short term profit.

My personal belief? We will have digital wallets on our phones that can hold any digital currency including central bank stable shitcoins, and that is what transactions will be done in and consumer pricing will be based on those. BUT decentralized coins like BTC will be used as stores of value, ways to shuttle remittences, etc. but you can just swap any coin to a stablecoin and the point of sale and no one will give a shit essentially what asset you bought your Starbucks with. Hell, I think the tokenization of physical assets is coming soon so you might essentially be able to pay for a cup of coffee with 1/1,000,000th of a barrel of oil via token form. This tokenization would also lead one to believe you could spend any kind of debt or equity with the same liquidity as cash. Now, the tokenization of these assets DOES make you wonder if BTC will still have value, but it’s immutable scarcity makes me believe it will have its place.

Here is my prediction for how that will happen: the price is going to pump to $50k or so and the world is going to find out that North Korea, Iran, etc. have been stockpiling crypto and hacking exchanges for the last 5 years, and now hold enough that a $50k value fundamentally will change their economic standing in the world. 
After that revelation, the “arms race” fear mentality to kick in and the US, China, and Russia will start holding crypto assets in their reserves to protect their economic power. Once that starts, it will be a runaway train. 
...or it won’t, who fucking knows, but I’ve seen arms races play out before and I could see human nature driving this kind of insane price.

Mine was that my buddy borrowed $200 from me at a casino because he lost his debit card and couldn’t go to the ATM, and promptly lost it playing blackjack. 
It took him 2 weeks to get a new debit card and he had never used Venmo or Square before and couldn’t sign up without a debit card. He finally used his bank’s quick pay service on a Friday at 6:00 PM and I didn’t get the money at my (different) bank until 10:00 AM on Monday. Bitcoin would have gotten me paid a lot sooner.

Aren’t there POS apps for merchants now that allow you to set a price in fiat, and the amount of BTC charged is just based on the conversion rate at that moment, and the merchant can opt to never even touch the crypto but have fiat directly deposited?

^this. I understand that some people believe bitcoin will replace fiat, but it would cause a global collapse of the financial system if we suddenly killed the concept of inflation, which encourages consumer spending and institutional investment in the economy rather than just hoarding resources. Bitcoin will be a more liquid version of current investment vehicles with value based on scarcity &amp; utility such as gold, silver, oil, etc.

I need to educate myself on how taxes are evolving on this. My understanding is if you make a profit significant enough to report, if you held the given coin for &lt; 1 year then you’re taxed at your income bracket, but if you hold &gt; 1 year it’s taxed at capital gains level (only 15% I believe?). My question is if they tax on a FIFO or LIFO basis; if I have 1 btc for a year, buy 1 more btc, then sell a month later for short-term profit, does the IRS recognize that you sold the FIRST coin, or the SECOND coin in order to determine the tax rate?
@_date: 2019-04-22 13:44:11
Say you are a business (of any size- family owned or a mega-corporation) that wants to expand to a new geography- how much discretionary income does your target demographic have in that market? How much do you stand to make vs how much do you have to spend to grow your business?
For jobs to be created and for economies to thrive, businesses need to be able to grow intelligently and not make unprofitable decisions such as “yeah so last quarter we spent $10M to expand our operations into Venezuela... and it turns out their average citizen can not afford our product now. To offset our losses we are going to need to lay off 10% of our workforce.” Having good data to operate on is very important to global economic growth.

By leaking government secrets in an effort to create transparency for citizens to know what their leaders are doing. 
Discrimination in the military, the extent of the US drone program &amp; the NSA’s data collection programs, are just a few items that were highlighted to the public through Wikileaks. 
That being said, I personally don’t know enough about the guy to have a valid opinion of him; I’ve heard of him covering up certain things while leaking others, and there is an obvious grey area of “what is considered freedom of information, and what is considered treasonous leaking of government secrets?” But overall he has shown the public that our representatives are not always who they say they are, and I think that’s a net positive for humanity, but those in power have an obvious reason to hate him.

You seem to be hung up on the word “secret” here- the military funded individual teams of researchers to develop various protocols that built ARPANET and other systems. These teams of researchers each had their small piece they received funding to build, and then the military aggregated all their work into a military comma network. 
It’s common practice for the military to have small teams work on small projects but not explain the big picture to them. The NSA does this today when they are developing data collection tools.

I think they are referring to the theories that the NSA developed the underlying bitcoin protocols that it runs on (including blockchain, but that’s only one of many). 
I think the theory is BS but it bases its argument largely on how hard it is to keep a secret like Satoshi’s identity, unless Satoshi is a group of people working under NDA’s that list treason as a repercussion for leaking the secret. 
Playing devils advocate- I agree that this is much more likely than Satoshi just being really disciplined and never engaging in public discourse on bitcoin and never touching the insane amount of bitcoin in their wallet for a decade even after it blew up. Also given that the internet itself was developed in secrete by the US military, it would make sense that the same organization(s) are responsible for developing the next generation of communications/ data transaction technology.

Look at current adoption rates- it is still in its infancy and it will either die or grow, so as long as it doesn’t die, adoption will continue and drive up demand. Simultaneously the immutably pre-programmed hash rate adjustment mechanisms and mining difficulty will systematically increase scarcity of new coins being created. Finally, there is a 21M BTC cap that will ever exist and 17M roughly have been mined; again, as long as adoption marches on and it doesn’t die, it will increase in its value in relation to inflationary fiat currency. Look at a logarithmic chart- despite only having 10 years of data from a non-recession period, it has marched upward for those that don’t buy high and sell low. The unknown of how it will act under a bear market is unknown in the US but we have seen the value of BTC skyrocket in countries when their economy crumbles.

You’re speaking to hyperinflation when politicians shit the bed on economic decisions and/or are simply corrupt. Steady low inflation over sustained periods of time lead to growth in the economy due to the incentive to lend to others to grow businesses, buy houses, seek education, etc. 
Personally, I have a mortgage, a car payment, and I’m almost (finally) done with my student loans (indentured servitude). 
Using my mortgage as an example, if rich people sat on all their wealth and were not incentivized to create lending institutions, no where near as many people would be able to pay all cash for a house which means far less would be built which means less construction jobs and less money going to the companies that make the building materials; all of this means less money being collected by the government to build (among other things but most importantly) armies. Meanwhile, let’s say China DOES have inflationary policies and their economic growth outpaced ours by a LOT, they would have more money flowing in to raise a world conquering army. 
This fear/distrust in what your adversaries are capable of is the economic arms race that has always and will always exist (in different forms) and will cause governments to adapt policies that discourage hoarding wealth. 
That being said, you as a free-thinking individual can recognize this manipulation and put your money in bouillon, real estate, bitcoin, etc. so you don’t have to be at the mercy of fiat economic policy

There are people speculating that the next bull run will take us to $100k-$250k but I think we will have 2 more cycles before that but the hodling of the second coin would hedge against me being wrong.

No one knows and none of us will- I’ve heard the estimated date that the last of all BTC will be mined around the year 2140. 
One would imagine if adoption has continued to grow by that point, one would imagine that an asset you can say with 100% certainty has no more supply available would jump in value but who knows. Things like a $1M price prediction that you hear actually are not that far fetched- if you think “1 of something is worth $1M USD” it can sound outlandish that any one thing is worth that much other than real estate, but when you think about the divisibility of BTC into Sats, the truer statement is “1 Sat is worth $0.01 USD” which doesn’t sound outlandish at all as a currency conversion.

Nothing can compete with today’s solutions by banks? What about the fact that if you want to Venmo someone and that person wants their money instantly? It costs them 1% of the amount unless they want the transaction with no fee in which case it will take 1-3 business days. Zelle has been a step in the right direction but I have also had issues with that when sending money to people with a different bank. 
Also, while credit cards have largely phased out international transaction fees, most debit cards do not allow free international transactions in different currencies as far as my knowledge goes. 
Personally I see the future of crypto lying in the Central banks’ future decisions on tokenizing fiat currency. If central banks start creating government backed stable coins, then naturally payment processors will adapt to accept digital coins at checkout. From that point, the future of crypto lies with digital wallet developers to develop ways to swap crypto for these central bank coins at the point of transaction for no cost. So if you hold BTC, Dash, and LTC for example and you want to pay for your coffee with Bitcoin, you would select bitcoin and scan/tap the register to initiate payment, and the merchant would receive their preferred currency of payment without even being aware you paid with crypto. Just my opinion, but my point being that there are many ways to improve on the current system that has been developed by banks.

You... you literally just described the original behavioral modification intention of inflation as a basic economic tool... in 1933 the US government outlawed hoarding gold because rich people didn’t want to hold fiat and the government cried like a child because no one wanted to play a game with them that they made up (although the game was developed between 800 BC and 600 AD). Inflation was designed to make people use their money instead of hold it. Economics is an arms race for countries to try and grow faster than their competitors. It is a bit in the horses’ mouth and you are the horse. This is not a revolutionary concept.

Some guy posted a few weeks ago he was going to do 10 push-ups every time he checked the price- I assume he’s dead now or he’s an absolute beef monument by this point.

So do you just like look on Craigslist for someone wanting to meet up in person to sell you bitcoin? Or are you using that as shorthand for online P2P? Because the former sounds like a super easy way to get kidnapped

Thank you for the info! Yeah I started dividing out the 1 oz pricing of the American Eagle coins I was seeing and the fact that the price varies wildly based on the year it was produced makes it very unattractive to me. I’ve heard the drawback of full bars is that you need to find a buyer wanting that much, but it looks like there are snappable ones that can be bought in large sheets but can be snapped apart into 1 g increments...
Right now I’m putting my money in crypto along with my traditional portfolio, but if another significant crypto bull run happens, I want to move some profit over to physical gold as well so want to educate myself now. 
Thanks again!

I mean this to me sounds like some old dude that runs a bar watched a Fox News piece calling bitcoin a scam and talking about people losing money and that old guy put this up like “SoRrY MiLlEnIaLs- we ain’t takin no magic innernet money round these parts!”
