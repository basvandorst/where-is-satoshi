Did you update your wallet?

All right. 40k is ALOT to have invested in just bitcoins. Get some stock. Most big ones work. 
Keep a bitcoin or 2 and withdraw the rest and invest. 
What you need is hardware wallet. Get a ledger and keep that shit safe. it's a ton of money.

For me living in Denmark I should be able to earn about 543 usd a year. But it would take me 3 years to break even - and who knows what will happen in meantime.
I say buy bitcoin. Leave the farming to chine farms.
