That ain’t an audit. The most they have ever released is a memo

People have been asking for a year.

You should be asking for evidence that they are backed by dollars. They’ve NEVER given any. Just a line on a website. No full audit ever by a big 4 auditor and no bank will deal with them. Draw your own conclusions.

Lol. Friedman dumped them and zero audits have been forthcoming for any period. Keep believing if you like, but there will never be an audit because it’s quite obvious now that bad things will be found. Maybe it’s just shady money laundering and not having zero backing for Tether... maybe it’s other accounting issues. But nobody should be comfortable having this lot managing a $2.2B cog in the worldwide crypto trading market.

It’s easy for Tether and Bitfinex to shut this conversation down. Get an audit. From a big 4 audit firm with an actual reputation. Instead they’ve done bullshit audit “memos”, promises and silence.
Sorry, all is definitely not well.

BCC loss in value wiped out holders. Tether is different. It’s used as the gateway to buy cryptos. It’s meant to be dollars. If it isn’t, the values of everything it was used to buy are inflated.

Show me the full audit. Every good exchange has one, once a year from a top firm. tether and bitfinex have NEVER had one. It’s easy to stop this conversation with the most obvious thing: proper audit.

I don’t have high hopes at all. Seems incredibly speculative at best.

What the miners want to do is fine if they go and make their own coin. How is this so hard to grasp?
I’ll swap my B2X for your BTC. Deal?
