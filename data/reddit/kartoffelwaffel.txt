It's beautiful
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:06:43
Well since even Bitpay accepts BCH now I guess you must be a core troll (or clueless). bch plz.
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:32:16
The entire Internet is controlled by [13 root name servers](

I'm surprised Wikipedia isn't in that list! C'mon man.

Damn I was getting ready for another bcash ver circlejerk.

That's a bannin'
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:50:49
Lol I think the folks in the other sub would find this hilarious instead of insulting
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:14:06
Why is no one using it?
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:18:12
Take this all with a bucket of salt though
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:56:23
An honest unbiased and enlightening response! 10/10

Except it's neither liquid nor a currency at the moment
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:46:06
Click history. It went up to $9500 before they paused trading and then cleared the order book citing liquidity issues.

Your conspiracy theories may carry more weight over in \r\btc
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:08:35
The shit posting (OP included) is simply by crypto noobs parroting what they've read inside this echo chamber and haven't conducted enough of their own research to know any better.
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:05:58
I know how LN works and it is very promising. It is an excellent solution but has it's drawbacks. Key among those is that we need LN now but it wont be fully implemented and adopted for a year or more.
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:28:52
Alpaca socks? Lol that was a while ago. Do they still sell them? My point is that the network fee for BTC is higher than the price of most small purchases like alpaca socks.
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:14:29
More than those who care what you think. Lay off the coke man!
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:12:10
Well *apparently* they are using Tether to keep the price of BTC aloft until they can sell enough at a high price to negate their losses. After that, who knows.
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:04:05
I just downloaded the eth blockchain to do some mining, 40gb!
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:18:39
A whole $100?? ^^^^whats ^^^^that ^^^^after ^^^^fees?
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:18:39
I am of the opinion that people will use whatever works best for the purpose they need it for. People who do their research, that is.
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:38:11
But the people who build it can..
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:04:31
The slowest way is to spend it! What with mempool at 200k and climbing fast.
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:56:51
Have you tried to spend any btc lately?
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:03:04
Beginning to? They've been doing it for *years*.
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:13:58
I say good comeback Mr H-O-D-L. You sure put them in their place!
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:21:26
If it goes according to their (alleged) plan there will be no fallout. They will recover their losses and make a tidy profit. But if they sell their tethers too quickly it could destabilize the market (further)
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:24:12
Because it's a decentralized system. You are not listing an item on ebay, you're listing an item in the software that you download, and it communicates your item with anyone else on the OpenBazaar network.
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:23:04
Woah calm down. It would be stupid *not* to diversify.
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:10:25
[Russia doesn't think so]( but it works very well and has never gone down despite constant attacks and one or two close calls.
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:23:56
That's a bannin'
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:15:49
Lol "computer engineer"
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:17:55
Probably because it's a registered company.
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:41:05
At this rate there will be no services left soon and we'll be stuck with our millions in btc and nothing to spend it on.

Wait, who's being patronizing?
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:29:35
100% agree
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:27:11
It's still centralized around whales who can afford the most channels
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:58:14
Yep, but anything downstream from root name servers is a glorified cache. The root servers have final say at the end of the day because they are hard coded into most OSes.
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:14:11
It doesn't fucking matter. It's irrelevant. BTC is HEMORRHAGING good projects like OpenBazzar and all we can do is cry "BCASH SHILL!". When did the community become so blind?
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:49:59
Chill dude
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:27:31
Hey! get back in the circlejerk!
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:53:29
It helps if you do your own research. I subscribe to most of the crypto subs and the people here are the blindest. I've made a substantial amount of money on other coins. But carry on.
@_date: 2018-09-18 14:25:49
There's a couple of bears that live there as well. Somewhat less interesting fact.
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:54:00
Ok now everyone call up and complain!! And dont forget to go and downvote all those nasty alt coiners.
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:05:37
1l? Get a bigger petrol tank?
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:33:10
Lol at the people downvoting you, with their fingers in their ears shouting "lalalalalalalala!!"
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:02:34
Facilitated by the transaction throughput bottleneck.

The future will be a holistic awakening of presence. The btc world is approaching a tipping point. Soon there will be an unfolding of life the likes of which the cryptoverse has never seen.
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:28:01


No, I mean what I said.
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:46:10
Everything is meaningless!
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:28:22
Lol he was right
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:15:06
That's a bannin'
@_date: 2018-09-19 08:39:21
Most likely.

You must be new here
@_date: 2019-10-31 13:30:22
"We" is often used like that in scientific papers when the author is explaining something. Here "we" is referring to you and the author. When your  teacher is showing you something he might say for e.g., "we have two variables...", it doesnt mean there's more than one teacher.
@_date: 2017-11-25 11:56:11
The shit talking is generally higher in this sub actually
@_date: 2017-11-22 03:53:23
This thread has been flagged for removal (just 3 minutes after you posted that)
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:48:10
Sounds like you're making shit up as you go, got any sources for all these claims champ?
@_date: 2017-11-25 11:54:57
This is the correct answer.
@_date: 2017-11-24 07:44:49
No the bch folk dont mind "bch", but they dislike "bcash" apparently.
@_date: 2019-02-24 03:28:48
Wot wot wot? 
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:59:11
No, different chains
@_date: 2017-11-25 11:37:54
I think you missed the part where BCH hard forked to fix this issue 2 weeks ago.
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:07:18
lol segmaito segmarto
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:56:31
Uhh what about the [retarded fees and wait times](
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:03:23
The answer to that question is never not yes. Except for me.
@_date: 2017-11-25 11:44:23
I mean have you ever bought a cup of coffee for $3 with a $7 'surcharge', I did, because this is how it was intended to be used.
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:43:05
I was addressing him as "redditor for 2 weeks". But perhaps you can tell me why I should take this anonymous Internet stranger's word as gospel when he has 0 reputation and has only been around for 2 weeks?
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:58:24
Funny thing is the post I linked was on the front page of this sub 10 months ago.
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:36:10
How about you back up your claims then? All of this is hearsay until then and I'll assume you're spreading bullshit, redditor for 2 weeks.
@_date: 2017-11-21 02:25:45
The BC|-| sub is owned by the same people as this heavily cens0red one
@_date: 2017-11-25 11:49:04
What happens to markets built on speculation?
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:23:01
Cens0rsh1p. Try post something about that word in this sub and watch your post disappear!
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:34:34
Settle down m8
@_date: 2017-11-25 11:46:24
Anyone smart enough to see that has already left this sub.
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:55:04
There's literally not enough money in the world for that market cap. That would be 21 trillion dollars worth of bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:03:17
Half the kids in this subreddit lap this shit up without questioning it.
@_date: 2017-11-25 11:40:13
I sub both subs and this one is by for the most childish. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 06:44:58
So you're not going to backup any of your claims then? I'll just file this under FUD then
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:00:12
Aussies too. BTC crossed $10k AUD some time ago

Why is that amazing? Do you actually think they would [upvote it?](  )
@_date: 2019-01-11 04:25:34
0 would mean 0 demand which isnt really possible
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:01:22
No my horse is perfect
@_date: 2019-09-11 10:11:28
how do you receive btc payments in fiat?
@_date: 2018-07-06 05:42:00
are you implying it isn't?
@_date: 2018-12-18 13:48:21
How does that stop direct sales like localbitcoins or p2p exchanges? It doesn't. The truth is the cat is out of the bag on crypto and where there's a will there's a way!
