The problem with his "linguistic analysis" is it doesn't take into account paid shills who make outlandish statements. hundreds of sock puppets screaming TO THE MOON is going to give false positives.

Perhaps it would be right to boycott Citibank then. I wouldn't use their services if they effectively reserve the right to choose what I can spend my own money on.
