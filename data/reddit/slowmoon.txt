Even **if** this were merely the accumulation of capital, it will probably be the biggest wealth transfer in the history of the world ... probably still counts as "changing the world." 
@_date: 2018-01-15 21:41:54
That's an underestimation of the effects of the wealth transfer alone. Look at how bitcoin holders as a population differ from the current population of the world's moneyed elite. I don't have the statistics in front of me, but I'd wager that bitcoin holders skew more open (in the psychological sense), younger, more male, more optimistic, more technophilic, more skeptical of government et cetera. It's a very different group of people. What are the implications of this?
Well, a cursory review of history reveals that the question of "Who has the capital?" in a given society makes an enormous impact on societal development. The concentration of wealth in the hands of elderly, xenophobic, ultra-traditionalist folks has, in several notable examples, resulted in societies undergoing periods of intense isolation and techno-cultural stasis that lasted centuries. We've also seen the way groups of young (usually male) upstarts with "funny ideas" and a bit of capital changed the course of history. 
To write this off as a bunch of nerds "accumulating capital" is a big mistake. Not everybody is interested in lambos. This wealth transfer will almost certainly alter the future, even if we can't say exactly how. Just to stimulate your thoughts: perhaps we end up with a world where 10 billion more dollars flow into risky bio-tech startups over the next few years than otherwise would. Could that increased flow of investment in bio-tech get us a health-related technology much sooner than in the no-Satoshi timeline? Might this have profound knock-on effects? There are too many moving parts to even begin to make concrete predictions, but I'll predict this: 
The fact that we have expensive bitcoin transactions in 2018 Q1 is ultimately not going to matter that much. The problems will get solved one way or another. Something extraordinary has been set in motion and it can't be undone.

"I think" wasn't subjective. It was merely adding a softer touch. You can read it as:
"There's this false urgency about a potential flood of pent up economic activity that would be released if only we would increase the blocksize to 8 MB. There isn't. If there were, we'd see millions of people using dogecoin to buy coffee. We don't."
Similarly, you can take out the "probably." Read it as:
"That would not have a negative effect on the network. It's simply not as urgent or important as people make it out to be."

It could. If foreign capital flow into the US intensifies, everyone will publicly blame the fed for its easy-money low interest rate policies creating a bubble. The fed may then be forced to raise rates (though that would cause even more corporate bankruptcies and capital flight to the US). Either way, this obviously won't end well.

A long time ago, a man named Pareto noticed that 80% of the wealth in Italy was owned by 20% of the people. Then he began to find that this was true for lots of things. 
I'd guess that 10% of bitcoins are lost forever.  Of the remaining coins, 80-90% will be owned by 10% of the richest holders. There will be maybe 1.8 to 3.6 million coins left to go around for everyone else on Earth to use. This is independent of price. If bitcoin ends up being worth nothing, they'll still be rare.

[Bitcoin will soon make an all-time high in rubles.](
It will make headlines in Russia and generate some excitement there. A new ATH in rubles means something to someone who is living in Russia getting paid in rubles and spending rubles. Russian stocks are certainly not making all-time highs when priced in rubles. This bull run is going to be interesting because every few weeks, we may have a new all time high in a different currency starting with the weakest ones in Russia, Brazil, South Africa, etc. as the values of various currencies have diverged so much. But the Russian excitement could spill over into the South African excitement into the Brazilian excitement and so on until finally the Chinese and Americans see all-time highs in our  currencies and take the ball and run with it.

This currency has always been shit. It's never been stable. It's always had heavy inflation. The currency had to be replaced in 2006.

That's not what he said. He said that each user can prove that he owns a certain sum of bitcoins and then the rest of us could individually filter the comments.

The $1 transactions that become uneconomical with a 20 cent transaction fee are simply not important enough to worry about at this time. Let them drop off the network. If you want to do $1 transactions, you don't need the security and decentralization of the bitcoin network. 
Use an altcoin. Use changetip. Use one of the countless alternatives that are going to let people do billions of $1 transactions per day (while sacrificing security, decentralization, etc.) instead of pretending that bitcoin will ever be able to process all those transactions if we would just make the blocks bigger.

Almost every other major oil exporter besides Nigeria and Saudi Arabia have plummeting currencies. They are just delaying the inevitable. But Nigeria doesn't have the foreign currency reserves or the cheap cost of oil production that Saudi Arabia has. There's no way that Nigeria will maintain their peg to the USD. It'll break just like the Azerbaijani peg broke.
@_date: 2015-12-23 11:50:07
In this case, their currency had been having problems since the year 2000. Massive problems. There was no way to know when the peg was going to break, but people had plenty of time to recognize that the government currency was not trustworthy.
A recurring theme with these crashes is that people wait until it's too late. Greece was melting down for months and months before withdrawals were finally frozen. If you're in a country where oil is the main export and oil crashes below $50 and conditions are getting worse, why wait to get out of the local currency? You can say that it's because of the lack of education, but bankruns used to be common in the 19th century in America. People weren't educated but every now and then they just panicked and got their money out. People need to start doing that again.

Barry's being a little coy there. Crypto-ransomers have made hundreds of millions and have successfully received payments for at least one high-profile kidnapping of a Hong Kong businessman. 
If you generate a fresh bitcoin address not tied to your identity to receive the coins and then quickly trade it in chunks for some altcoin or trade it for physical cash without ever connecting your identity to those coins, then the link is broken. 
If you think about kidnappings, it's clear that bitcoin is actually the best way to receive the money. Let's say the kidnappers have some important guy tied up in a basement. Do you want to receive money through your bank account? No, obviously the bank will work with LE and freeze your money. Do you want to receive money in cash? No, because LE can catch you while you're picking up the cash. 
With bitcoin, you can say "Send the money to the following address. Once I get the money, the hostage will be safely set free." Within 10 years, I predict that 100% of kidnappers will demand cryptocurrencies rather than physical cash.

There will be attributable digital currencies (with reversible transactions, blacklisted addresses, user-readable names, etc.) and then there will be digital cash (bitcoin). And when it comes to the masses, the former is going to be more popular than the latter, believe it or not.
McAfee is right in thinking that the masses are not going to be walking around with irreversible, bearer currency on hardware wallets (sitting right next to their blaster holsters). This is science fiction. 
People want to be able to call someone if they make a mistake (e.g. they sent money to the wrong person). They want guarantees and safety. They don't want volatility. They don't want to accidentally send a transaction fee that's too big and never get that money back. 
Bitcoin can grow a lot more and will play its own role in the global financial system, but I don't think most people are going to deal with the "raw" bitcoin. I think it's more likely that Google will lock down a shitton of raw bitcoin and then give you tokens that you can do lots of cool things with. The traditional banks might die, but they will be replaced by other Fintech service providers. ETFs will lock down a shitton of raw bitcoin and then stock exchanges will give you tokens that you can trade. 
There will be individuals who still want to use bitcoin directly and run their own full nodes and whatnot, especially if they want privacy, but just looking around at people's behavior today on Facebook and Google, it's clear that the masses don't put much of an emphasis on privacy or security. IMO, a minority of users will work with bitcoin directly, even if bitcoin is very successful.

He's not trying to move value. He's trying to make money via smuggling. People in India will buy physical gold for higher prices than you can buy gold for in Singapore. This is caused, in part, by a 10% tax on gold brought into India. He's trying to profit from the difference in prices caused by the tax. He does that by buying cheap gold in Singapore, not paying the tariff, and then selling the gold for a higher price in India. 
Bitcoin doesn't help with this whatsoever. This is actually a matter of getting physical gold past India's customs agents.

Yes, being your own bank is only this magnificent thing from a libertarian or extreme individualist perspective. It's helpful to try to assume the perspective of someone else. Your average person doesn't really care about the decentralization aspect. He wants to know what bitcoin can do for him. Can he save money using it? Can it make his life better? Quite frankly, we should hope that a big, deep-pocketed company like Google just takes over the bitcoin security game. Requiring 2-factor authentication stops most security problems. And Google itself is probably the most secure information vault in the world. Google becoming the ultimate bitcoin bank doesn't stop any of us from having our own cold wallets and security systems. But it would enable your average person to participate without investing time in learning to practice good operational security.

1. Fees are still quite low. If there were an urgent demand for blockspace, then you would see people bidding against each other for it. You would also see low value transactions spilling over into other blockchains. We see neither. 
2. With bigger blocks, it's harder to run a full node. This increases centralization. With increasing centralization, we lose the defining feature of bitcoin. It's not a matter of my right to say which transactions deserve space. It's simply not realistic to try to accommodate tiny transactions on the blockchain when more elegant, polycentric solutions are coming or already here. If you really want to do a tiny transaction directly on a blockchain, you can use dogecoin. Why does bitcoin have to do everything?

It wouldn't double instantly and it wouldn't halve instantly. The markets generally incorporate information into the price as expected events draw nearer. 
There's also a chance that bitcoin fails for a variety of reasons before next year which are factored in now. As those reasons are found to be unsubstantiated and bitcoin survives, the price also rises. 
It's very tough to say what the halving will do and when. But this market is very immature. I'd say that immature markets are less efficient at pricing in far away events, especially when the fundamentals are unclear and economic data (e.g. Silk Road sales, daily Bitpay volume) is not public information.
Is the fact that there are only going to be 21 million bitcoins priced in at the moment? I really don't think it is. There's daily selling pressure from people who are doing businesses on a day-to-day basis. Their pockets aren't deep enough to price in something that's going to happen years from now in a system that might not exist.
After observing several dogecoin halvings, the results don't fit a consistent pattern. IMO, we're in an extended bear market (on a log scale) and the market is less likely to incorporate positive future information into the price when we're here in the doldrums.

Not just government. Businessmen try to find out as much about their rivals as possible for competitive purposes. Corporate spies will love bitcoin. If I can identify your addresses, see your balances, track where they are going, and when they move, I'm at a big advantage as a rival. 
Bitcoin's current open ledger might also be attractive to extortionists. if I can identify rich people, I can target them for extortion and kidnappings (common in many parts of the world).
I could go on. A transparent ledger has its strengths, but also its weaknesses. It threatens privacy and also fungibility (think about blacklisting of coins). And it *is* creepy when you have people watching your addresses and snooping around trying to see where the balances are spent and identify the owners. Sure if you use religiously use TOR, mix your coins, and never re-use addresses, you can have reasonable privacy, but that's a lot of work.
Some people here probably don't give enough of a damn about bitcoin outside its potential to make them rich to actually discuss its failings and what we need to improve. They're stuck in the "Rah-rah-rah Go Bitcoin!" echo chamber. Fair enough. I was there at one point.

There would still be demand for financial services. People would still want loans. Loans are not going to go away. John Rockefeller started by spending money he didn't have (JP Morgan Sr.'s money). Of course, loaning bitcoin is not a smart idea as it would be difficult to pay back a bitcoin loan. (If all available bitcoin were lent, then it would be strictly impossible for everyone to pay back their loan because it would require more bitcoin than existed)
But I think this simply means that fiat will still have some value as it is convenient to lend fiat to others. Either that or a sidechain/altcoin with permanent inflation will be used for loans while bitcoin will be used as a store of value. But it's clear that one currency can't perform both roles.

Derivatives aren't gambling. Options and futures were invented thousands of years ago because because farmers wanted to mitigate their risk of being ruined by a bad harvest. Buyers of crops (such as wine or olive oil producers) wanted to mitigate the risk of very high grape or olive prices. So they agreed to enter into a fixed-price contracts for future transactions. The idea today is the same. 
Patrick Byrne, CEO of Overstock, wants a well-developed derivatives market for bitcoin so that Overstock can hold more bitcoin and do more with bitcoin. For example, he can buy the option to sell bitcoin at the price at which he acquired them. This would allow Overstock (and more importantly its shareholders) to avoid the risk of bitcoin's value crashing while Overstock is holding bitcoin. At the same time, he could sell the option to buy a portion of those bitcoin for a certain price to someone else. That would allow him to hold bitcoin very cheaply with little risk, which could be more advantageous than immediately converting all bitcoin income to dollars.

The reason that bitcoin remittances are cheap is that they do an end-run around compliance costs. That means no money transmitter regulations, no capital controls, and  no middleman costs. I buy bitcoin on Mycelium Local Trader and pay a 3% fee. The BTC is sold in another country for a 3% premium. Boom, currency exchanged and money transferred internationally for free. This is what people aren't getting.
Once you add a "bitcoin remittance office" that grows big enough to warrant government's attention, that company will need to pay gobs of money to comply with laws, put a bunch of money aside for a bond, buy insurance, get a money transmitter license, pay employees, etc. Then you are right back in Western Union's and the banks' playground and you are just reintroducing all the costs again. God forbid one of your customers resides in New York.
My idea of the ideal bitcoin-based remittance system is just huge numbers of individual Mycelium local trader and Localbitcoins "cells" zipping money around the planet unchecked and unencumbered. This is how you do the free or near-free remittances.

The thing to know about BTCChina is that they are *not* a leading exchange in China anymore, and they are *not* privy to any special information. How do I know this? Well, Bobby Lee basically lost 90% of BTCChina's volume to Huobi/OKCoin when he disabled bank transfer deposits after the 3rd party payment processor ban. Disabling bank deposits was a conservative move and he felt he was being a good boy by bending over backwards to show the Chinese government that BTCChina wanted to comply. Did banks count as 3rd parties? No one could say for sure. Bobby and much of the bitcoin community felt that Huobi and some of the other exchanges were being naughty by continuing to accept bank deposits.
Since then Bobby Lee has seen that Huobi and other exchanges have been allowed to continue operating. He then re-enabled bank deposits. If Bobby had a special relationship with Chinese regulators, he would've simply called someone up and gotten a definitive answer on whether allowing bank transfers were cool. At best, he knows nothing. At worst, the Chinese government favors other exchanges and actively keeps Bobby out of the loop. He mentioned that he was on a plane mid-flight when the 3rd party payment processor ban was issued. Quite a coincidence.
Think about it. BTCChina was clearly the dominant Chinese exchange at the time and the Chinese government regulators didn't think to call him up so that he could prepare for the chaos? The regulators were happy to have a private meeting with the 3rd party processor CEOs and tell them what they were going to announce in advance. One of those CEOs then leaked the news prematurely on the Chinese equivalent of Twitter. So there were a number of people who actually *were* privy to special information and Bobby Lee was not one of them.
Conclusion: Everyone is guessing about the future of bitcoin in China, including Bobby Lee. No one knows what the Chinese government is going to do. There are some folks who are privy to special information when it pertains to them. Bobby Lee is not one of them. If anyone is going to know in advance of a bank deposit ban, it will likely be the CEOs of major Chinese banks.

@_date: 2014-12-05 07:37:53
There's another point of confusion with trustless. Saying that bitcoin is "trustless" is misleading because getting rid of the middle-man sometimes makes a transaction *more* dangerous. In cases where you are dealing with a new or unknown merchant (e.g. a seller on eBay), many folks prefer to trust their payment processor or bank (with whom they have a long-term relationship) to resolve any problems rather than give a bunch of digital cash to the other guy and hope for the best.
Let's clarify this. In a typical e-commerce transaction, you are trusting several parties: the bank, the payment processor, and the other guy (e.g. the merchant). Bitcoin gets rid of trusting that the bank or payment processor will cheat you. You still have to trust the other guy to provide the service you are paying for. If you don't know the other guy well and he doesn't have an established reputation, then you probably *will* want a middleman. 
Of course, in cases where middlemen are desirable, the two parties using bitcoin are free to choose any sort of middle-man they agree upon to help resolve disputes. This is advantageous because they can choose a middleman who has the relevant knowledge and expertise to efficiently handle any disputes.
Personally, I think "No middleman required" and "No need to trust a middleman" are good, accurate, neutral ways to describe what bitcoin allows you to do. There's a reason why escrow agents, arbitrators, lawyers, and  other middle-men exist. What bitcoin allows is for flexibility.  You can choose who to trust *if* you need to trust someone.

The media is going to stigmatize cash to the point where if you ask to pay with cash, people are going to think you are trying to do something bad. I can already see it happening. Someone is sponsoring this legislation. Just search for "ban cash." Who is pushing all these stories and all this legislation? Politicians don't sponsor legislation for free. They're not doing it because they're bored or because voters are demanding it. They are doing it because someone is paying them to do it. Central bankers want to be able to freeze all your money and have negative interest rates. It's not tinfoil theory. Just look at Cyprus and Greece. Bail-ins. Police confiscating cash. 
They *don't want you to have your own money in your own possession*. I guess I'm a contrarian "butter" because my instinctual reaction is that I want to have *all* my money in my possession and bitcoin seems like the best way to do it. Maybe the only way. Because physical gold can be seized and possession of it was made illegal earlier in American history. So it's not like it can't happen again. Your land can easily be seized. Yes, bitcoin can be seized if they throw you in a prison cell and just make you hand over your private keys, but it's really the only thing that you can plausibly deny that you have. And it's really the only thing that you can walk across a border with with zero evidence that you have it. Bitcoin is the only game in town. What else can serve the same purpose?

As useful as a credit card is now? That's a pretty high standard. Gold isn't as useful as a credit card. Try getting a hotel room or a taxi when you've got gold in your pocket. If that's your standard, I'd say that bitcoin has much less than a 50% chance of succeeding. 
But bitcoin has so many possible use cases. All it needs is to gain a foothold in one area to be successful in my opinion. For example, if bitcoin becomes a store of value that's 5% as popular as gold, that would be a success. If bitcoin continues to be the currency of choice for online black markets, that would be a success. I think the chance of bitcoin gaining a foothold in at least one niche is pretty high.  
@_date: 2014-04-15 22:22:40
When bitcoin shows that it can survive for a decade and not crumble or be overtaken by something better, it will become very attractive as a store of value. That's where you can get crazy with valuations. People are keeping up to 20 trillion in offshore accounts and trillions more in gold as a place to store their money. And bitcoin is much more convenient than those. Plus it gives you the peace of mind knowing that some fraction of your wealth is locked with a key that you personally control rather than some sleazy Swiss banker who won't hesitate to give you up to save his neck. No one can seize it. No one can sanction you, freeze your bank accounts, or otherwise make your money unspendable. No one can even know for sure that you have it so long as you bought it and mixed it anonymously.
If bitcoin becomes that sort of store of value, the long-term price for one would be pushed into the six figures. $100,000+ for one. And that's totally ignoring its use as a payment mechanism. I don't know if that's the moon or the Milky Way, but looking at the current price of less than $500, I think it makes sense to own 1 bitcoin.

If the market conditions are such that there are more sellers than buyers in India, then buy bitcoin to get your money out at the best price. Then use a bank wire or another method to get your money back in at the best price. And why do you assume they want to get their money back into India? We're talking about hypothetical people doing hypothetical things. Maybe they want to buy stuff in the UK. Dare to dream. 
International arbitrageurs have costs. They don't do the trade if the Indian price is too high. But if the Indian price is sufficiently high, then there's no problem using bitcoin to send money into India.

Unless your plan is to push down the market rate and then immediately buy massive amounts of BTC privately *at* the market rate.

I agree that bitcoin has the potential to make all of our lives *so* much better, even if we don't get rich. But I don't mind the greed.  I think that the most ingenious non-technical aspect of bitcoin is that greed is part of the delivery mechanism. The first stage of adoption had hobbyism as a delivery mechanism. You got into mining bitcoin because it was neat. Then you spent 10,000 on a pizza for fun. The second delivery mechanism is greed. The idea that maybe you'll get rich as an early adopter is what is making all these people build increasingly advanced miners, professional exchanges, ATMs, exchange traded funds, and trade enough bitcoins back and forth with enough frequency for there to be good liquidity. If we had to depend on hobbyists and people dedicated to virtue and principles to get us a fully functioning bitcoin ecosystem, I'd be worried.

Power and influence won't disappear because of uncounterfeitable digital currencies. You'll still be able buy power and influence. That's not the point he's making. He's talking about the distortion (fraud) that comes from being able to boost your ratio of ownership of dollars by arbitrarily making more of them and assigning them to yourself. That kind of control of the money supply is what allows wars with unlimited budgets.

1. It's simply not true that people don't usually invest in currencies. Billionaires are always buying and selling currencies as investments. George Soros famously made a fortune betting against the British pound. Jim Rogers has been buying the Russian rouble and the Chinese renminbi as investments because he think they are undervalued. People in developing countries do this as well on a smaller scale. Often, their local currency sucks, so they'll keep their savings in a currency that they are more bullish on. They believe that the USD or Euro will be a better investment than their local currency. It will hold its value or appreciate better than their local currency. Any time you hold a currency, you are essentially investing in it. And you are using it as a store of value. 
2. Bitcoin and the blockchain don't have a specific "purpose." It's a new technology and people are going to use it how they want to. Bitcoin may be a great way to send value across national borders, but that doesn't mean it's the only way you can use it. The blockchain can be use for completely non-currency related things, such as assigning and keeping track of ownership (see: colored coins).
I would argue that investing in bitcoin is a win-win for the buyers and the bitcoin ecosystem as a whole because investing in bitcoins is like indirectly investing in bitcoin companies, infrastructure, and advertisement.
Infrastructure:  Take Lamassu bitcoin machines for example. After the November rally, lots of bitcoin enthusiasts found themselves with some extra money, and Lamassu received over 100 new orders for bitcoin ATMs. And now there are already 25+ machines out there in the wild and more coming online every week. And those machines are going to make it a lot easier to send remittances and actually use bitcoin as a medium of exchange. 
Volatility: The higher bitcoin's market cap goes, the less volatile it becomes. The less volatile it becomes, the more comfortable companies will be with holding bitcoin itself instead of immediately trading it for dollars.
Advertisement: bitcoin rallies generate media attention which serves as free advertising for bitcoin. Do you think the Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-Shing would've invested in Bitpay if bitcoin didn't make huge waves in the media due to the rallies in price caused by bitcoin investors?  
All participants in the bitcoin ecosystem contribute to it. Even short-term speculators who don't care about bitcoin at all are working to improve liquidity (making it more available to buy and sell). Investors in bitcoin play a very important role in helping bitcoin bootstrap from an experiment to a global currency.  This is really a genius aspect of bitcoin. It uses people's self-interest and greed as a delivery/bootstrapping mechanism rather than pointing guns at people and saying "you need to use this currency."

There'd obviously be a coordination problem here. If a bunch of central banks decided to have negative interest rates and banned cash, and a few countries had positive interest rates and didn't ban cash, then people would just start selling the former's currency short and buying the latter's currency. George Soros style speculative attack which would result in hyperinflation.
They'd need to either ban foreign currency exchange or try to coerce the non-cooperating countries with sanctions or military action which itself has its own coordination problems. In any case, people would figure out ways to get out of weak currencies. This egghead plan wouldn't work without a world government.

Right. It wouldn't take more than a few days (if not one day) to pick up a few thousands coins at the market rate. They either underbid to get more dollars or underbid to get more bitcoin. But they won the auction on Dec. 4 and the coins were delivered on Dec. 8-9th when the bitcoins were worth much less. So in retrospect this has been a failure for them, but there's no way they could've known that on Dec. 4. Bad luck.

I think OB is meant for trading anything. No reason why bitcoin themselves couldn't be traded.
Nevertheless, I'm still pessimistic about people doing the smart thing by using multi-sig, decentralized escrow. Look at the dark net markets. The centralized ones fail all the time and people lose money. Today, there are dark net markets with multi-sig escrow.

You're right about one thing: most fund managers are conservative unless they are maverick VC/Hedge fund cowboys trying to make a 40% return. Mutual fund managers are largely happy to underperform the S&amp;P and collect their fee. They are steering clear of bitcoin.
Now imagine it's the end of 2017. The highest returning mutual fund of the year is a tech fund that put 1% of its portfolio into COIN and COIN was a 20-bagger. Paypal and eBay have fully integrated bitcoin by this point along with a dozen other Fortune 500s.  Now you're an idiot if you don't have 1% in COIN in 2018. That's the bull case.

Can you be more specific? I can't really help you if you say "it seems like all these are false." And how is it a tangent? 
He said that businesses are leading to a new concentration of power into the hands of a new elite. I gave three reasons why the bitcoin elite have less power than the government elite. Do you need me to connect the dots more? 
1) Government can print money as much as they want. The bitcoin elite can't. 
2) Government controls the flow of money through banks and across borders. They will assist in freezing and seizing money from people. They force the banks to refuse business with certain countries. The bitcoin elite can't do this.  
3) Government elite don't lose control of money if they cause a recession with their policies. They get to keep power as long as they keep guns pointed at us and maintain order. The bitcoin elite don't. If they fail, their company goes bankrupt and gets replaced. Their coins become worthless. 
If you want me to go on a tangent, I will. Here we go:
I'm not saying bitcoin creates a perfectly flat system (nor would I want that). Some people will have more sway than others. My opinion matters a lot less than Gavin's. But it's still a hell of a lot better than my government's mismanagement of its currency. And if I really disagree with the bitcoin core developers, I can leave. If I disagree with bitcoin's inherent economic philosophy of a hardcap because I think a currency with permanent inflation is better, I can go join the dogecoin movement. I can use whichever cryptocurrency supports my philosophy and my political agenda. I can start my own cryptocurrency and try to convince others why it should be used. What could be more empowering for the individual than that? Try coining your own centralized currency in America or China and see what happens to you. (See Liberty Reserve, e-Gold).

Even if most people aren't interested in bitcoin, couldn't 20 million people around the world eventually use bitcoin in niche markets, such as illegal commerce? Aren't there millions of people ordering pharmaceuticals from India and giving shady people their credit cards and billing addresses to do it? 20 million users would make someone getting involved today an innovator. If bitcoin dies soon, that same person could be a laggard. It's hard to say where we are.

They want to know about significant transfers. The change in your pocket when you step on a plane is not significant and therefore not a threat to their tax revenues and capital controls.


Illegal/copyrighted materials on Youtube these days are very quickly taken down if their owners want them taken down or if they offend enough people. Youtube is a shadow of its former self. Bitcoin would be the same under white-listing/coin-validation schemes.

Well, I think Pantera Capital is trying to attract investors with that number :). $4,200,000 / bitcoin is what happens if BTC takes over the world. Even if we take it seriously, it creates less than 340,000 millionaires currently. For comparison, China added 40,000 new millionaires to the world in 2013 alone. But yes, at that point it would be possibly the greatest wealth transfer in history. Thanks for the tip.

Short answer: Yes
For the long answer, we must reflect upon Satoshi's words:


– boring grey in colour
– not a good conductor of electricity
– not particularly strong, but not ductile or easily malleable either
– not useful for any practical or ornamental purpose
and one special, magical property:
– can be transported over a communications channel


**Maybe it could get an initial value circularly as you’ve suggested, by people foreseeing its potential usefulness for exchange. (I would definitely want some) Maybe collectors, any random reason could spark it.**
The bolded part is the important part. 
In the act of hodling and accumulating, the  hodlers show the rest of the world that bitcoin has value (i.e. it can reliably be sold for USD, gold, cars, or whatever it is that they want). Once that happens, you have programmable, uncounterfeitable money that can be stored in your head and transferred anywhere secretly.
The problem right now is that the rest of the world is largely unconvinced that bitcoin will reliably hold value. They think it will go to $0 at any moment. And if that's true, then none of its other properties matter.
If bitcoin survives and holds value for years because a bunch of people decide to hodl it, then all the sudden people are going to realize that you can, for example, generate 100 unseizable offshore bank accounts in a second, or ... send a billion dollars out of your country without using any bank.  This would be the "for some reason" part of your question. I can think of some people who might be interested in that.
**tl;dr**: the act of hodling is the only thing that can convince the world that bitcoin is not just a financial "hot potato" that people are just trying to pass off to someone else to make $$$ before the whole thing collapses. the act of hodling is what shows people that there is demand for the bitcoin itself.

The interfaces of Coinbase, Bitpay, and Bitgo, etc. are already super simple. Much simpler and faster than online banking and credit cards, IMO. Buying bitcoin on Coinbase in the first place couldn't be much simpler. When I get a Bitpay invoice, I can login to Coinbase and pay it faster than I can fill out my address on the credit card order form. Signing up as a merchant with Bitpay or Coinbase is also not any harder than signing up to accept credit cards or Paypal. And there are already ways to send bitcoin to e-mail addresses and other human-readable addresses. I think we're just waiting for regulatory clarity and a few more big players to adopt bitcoin before the snowball starts rolling rather than user interfaces. The interfaces are pretty good. Maybe we're not at Gchat yet, but we're past IP addresses and ICQ.

I said "billing address." Often you need to enter your billing address in order for the transaction to go through especially if it's a small/foreign payment processor.

Agreed 100%. As much as I support bitcoin, I will ditch it if it stops being what it's supposed to be. I'm not going to support any currency that is even compatible with any "coin validation" scheme. I'm not going to support any currency that can be taken over by one or two mining pools. So either those issues get addressed or we throw Bitcoin into the pile along with E-gold, Liberty Dollars, etc. and keep going to keep going until we get it. But Bitcoin as a protocol can be changed by consensus, so hopefully it won't have to come to that.

It's also possible that the Payment protocol will be extended with more BIPs, so that the transaction log could list the purchases made instead of showing the addresses.

Trustless Wills - Structure a transaction so that if your wallet balance is unchanged for 5 months, it transfers the balance to your wife and children's wallet addresses in the amounts that you specify. No lawyers. No government. No court battles over what Dad "really wanted." No ridiculous wait times.  Sign a copy of the will along with the transaction.

There's no real advantage for the average Joe.  Joe Average has most of his net worth in his house. He doesn't need secret unseizable "offshore" wealth storage. He does not need to do a ton of international transactions. He doesn't participate in the black market internet trade. He doesn't need do-it-yourself remittances. 
Moreover, he doesn't *want* to learn how to secure his computer and secure his private keys. He doesn't want to learn how to mix  his coins to preserve his privacy. He doesn't want to give up all consumer protections if a merchant tries to rip him off.
He can use cash if he really wants privacy when he buys condoms or anything embarrassing. 
Centralized services are good enough for Joe Average for now. Applepay, Google Wallet, Facebook pay and whatever else emerges is going to be fine for Joe Average. Bitcoin is going to be a niche thing for quite a while. It's not even close to being seen as a place of safety (a "hedge" against economic collapse). Nor is it even close to being more convenient or frictionless as my credit card.
Bitcoin's value will be supported by niche users and speculators until it grows developed and common enough to be useful for the average folk.

Well, yeah, you'll still need to keep records.

When you have low margins (as overstock and tigerdirect do), a 2.5% processing fee might be equal to half of your profits. Imagine you sell something for 100 dollars and after all your costs besides payment processing you are going to make 5 dollar profit. Visa's fee is 2.5%. That would be $2.50. Now imagine you are using  Bitpay's flat fees for all-inclusive payment processing.
You can increase profits or you can lower your price below your competitors.

Once you add a "bitcoin remittance office" that grows big enough to warrant government and Western Union's attention, that company will need to pay gobs of money to comply with laws, put a bunch of money aside for a bond, buy insurance, get a money transmitter license, pay employees, etc. Then you are right back in Western Union's  and the banks' playground and you are just reintroducing all the costs again. God forbid one of my customers resides in New York. I'll have Ben Lawsky boarding a plane to Asia wearing a red bandana to come burn down my remittance office. 
My idea of the ideal bitcoin-based remittance system is just huge numbers of Mycelium local trader and Localbitcoins "cells" zipping money around the planet unchecked and unencumbered. This is how you do the free or near-free remittances. If people don't realize that you can do free or near-free transfer of money across international borders with bitcoin, then I guess it will have to be my secret. But I don't believe that something like this can stay secret. Others, whether they are educated or not, are going to figure it out and they're going to do it to save tons of money. They're going to figure it out fast. Bitcoin just needs some more time to develop street cred. It needs to survive for a bit longer without dying to show people that it's robust and it's hear to stay.

I don't think we're in agreement, actually. I never said bitcoin would be the best way all the time. I said there's no reason why hawala brokers or Western Union couldn't use bitcoin as a useful transfer mechanism. How much they use it or how good it would be depends on how much the bitcoin markets grow and how much volume the markets can support. If a big bitcoin market develops in India (as it has in China - you can sell a million dollars worth of bitcoin in China without much of a problem) and there's lots of investment in bitcoins in India, then converting bitcoin to rupees will not have much of an effect on price of bitcoins in India. That will make it quite useful when transferring money to India. If bitcoin adoption in India is widespread and people can spend bitcoin in India, then you may not even need to convert it to rupees. 
If you're talking about *right now*, then we're in agreement. The bitcoin market in India is quite small.

Bitcoin's price is an extremely relevant factor as to whether the underlying technology will disrupt finance. The currency and the protocol cannot be separated. Bitcoin with a tiny market cap will be  volatile, illiquid, and not useful. 


And none of those applications will be secure without incentives for the miners. The lower bitcoin's price, the less incentive there is to secure the blockchain and process those transactions.

Cryptocurrency is not interesting to me unless it can survive all forms of attack. This includes attack by government regulation. It also includes attack in the form of hackers, bugs, malicious miners, superior competition, or anything else. If it can't survive government regulations (see e-Gold and Liberty Reserve), then I'm happy to see it fail. Let bitcoin be another iteration in our quest to create something better.  For me, bitcoin is not the venture capitalist elevator pitch about "frictionless payments" for Dell. 
Quite frankly, I'm more interested in supporting a technology that is robust, secure, and anonymous enough for the black markets to use. A technology that is anti-fragile. If it's ready for the black markets, then it gains a baseline value. If it gains a baseline value, then it becomes a somewhat reliable store of value that only you control. If it becomes a somewhat reliable store of value that only you control, then there's no longer any point in taking the counter-party risk in hiding your millions with some offshore banker who promises to keep it safe and not give up your name. And the higher its market cap goes, the less volatile it becomes and the more useful it becomes. 
But first, it needs to be anti-fragile. 
So no, I don't want to e-mail Dana Syracuse. I don't want to petition Ghash.io and beg them not to go over 51%. Don't you see that this is counter-productive? Either the technology is strong enough to withstand attack, or it isn't. It's either Napster or it's Bittorrent. And there's only one way to find out. Cryptocurrency can be wildly successful even if it's 100% banned by most or all of the countries in the world. All you need to do is look at the size of System D. And if any  governments decide to embrace bitcoin, then that is just a bonus.

The bitcoin rich don't have access to unlimited 0% loans and government resources as the fiat rich do. As they spend their wealth, it disappears. In order to stay rich in perpetuity, they will need to actually run businesses or invest in businesses. You might say that bitcoin is deflationary so they will just keep getting richer and richer. That's true for now because we are nowhere near the saturation point. But if bitcoin reaches a point of saturation, the supply is going to be priced in and it will be much more stable. Therefore, simply holding bitcoins will not be a way to stay rich.

There's an important difference. File-sharing is mostly the enemy of some large publishers, studios, content creators, and other private industry players. Lawmakers and law enforcement in the US (for example) have fought file-sharing at the behest (lobbying) of these players, but there was always a limit to how hard they'd fight and how much resources they'd expend to protect these industry groups. In the end, the government was basically acting as mercenaries for private industry. It wasn't government's fight to lose.
Cryptocurrency, in contrast, may pose a threat to government itself. Without control of money, it becomes much harder to raise money through tax and control of the money supply. Without money, the governments can't do anything. They can't pay government workers. Therefore, the fight against cryptocurrency will be much more difficult and hard-fought than the fight against file-sharing. Governments will use all the weapons at their disposal, such as throwing people in cages, to regain complete control of money. I think we will find that if the government is fighting for self-preservation, their success in suppressing bitcoin will be considerably greater than their success in suppressing filesharing.

Greed as a delivery mechanism is part of the genius of capitalism (and bitcoin). That's why you had communist leaders in the Soviet Union secretly ordering and drinking Coca Cola, giving money to the American government. Even those whose power is threatened by free markets find those markets irresistibly attractive and will indulge in them, corrupting themselves and strengthening the enemy. Not only will bitcoin attract those who don't believe in bitcoin, such as Peter Schiff, but it will also attract the people who oppose bitcoin, so long as it furthers their greedy ambitions. 
Imagine this: A Chinese government official publicly supports yet another restriction on bitcoin use in China because the Chinese government correctly sees bitcoin as a threat to their control over capital inflows and outflows in China. This same government official accepts a bribe in bitcoin on the sly. He's got a pile of dirty cash from awarding government contracts to firms that greased his palms. He then anonymously converts the rest of his bribe money into bitcoin so he can spend it in Europe. He agrees in principle with the government's position that bitcoin should be controlled, but if he gets caught with that dirty money, he could be made an example of. He needs to protect his own greedy neck and cryptocurrency will do.
Meanwhile, crypto just grows stronger and more widespread.

Depends on who you ask. There are some small government libertarians who are fine with prisons, federal prosecutors, etc. Some anarcho-capitalists would say that voluntary institutions could handle everything in the absence of government. Right now, there's no reason why laws against fraud and theft don't apply to bitcoin. If you want to learn more about how private law and voluntary systems would work in anarchy, I would read Chaos Theory by Robert Murphy. Here's an excerpt:
"Well, how does our present system of auto damages work?
right now, if I sideswipe someone, I must pay a stiff penalty. or rather,
my insurance company does.
It would be the same way with all torts and crimes under the system I’ve described.
an insurance company would act as a guarantor (or co-signer) of a client’s contracts with various firms. Just
as a bank uses experts to take depositors’ money and efficiently
allocate it to borrowers, so too would the experts at the insurance
company determine the risk of a certain client (i.e., the likelihood he or she would violate contracts by stealing or killing) and
charge an appropriate premium. 
Thus, other firms wouldn’t have to keep tabs on all of their customers and employees; the firms’ only responsibility would be to make sure everyone they dealt with carried a policy with a reputable insurance agency. Under this system, the victims of a crime are always paid, immediately. (Contrast this to the government system, where victims usually get nothing except the satisfaction of seeing the criminal placed behind bars.) There would also be incentives for people to behave responsibly. Just as reckless drivers pay higher premiums for car insurance, so too would repeat offenders be charged higher
premiums for their contract insurance.
And why would the person with criminal proclivities care about his insurance company? Well, if he stopped paying his premiums, his coverage would be dropped.
with no one to underwrite his contractual obligations, such a person would make a very poor customer or employee. People wouldn’t hire him or trust him to browse
through a china shop, since there would be no “legal” recourse if he did anything “criminal.”

There will always be an elite and big companies, but the bitcoin elite will have much less power over bitcoin than the government elite have over banks and national currencies. It's different in at least 3 major ways:
1) The bitcoin elite still need to follow the rules of the protocol. They can't speed up the minting of new bitcoin or change the cap without consensus.  
2) Regardless of whatever is built on top of bitcoin, including exchanges, payment processors, etc., the protocol itself will always be open to individuals to use. I will always be able to accept bitcoin from anyone in the world no matter who I am. I can hold it without anyone being able to seize it. I don't need the elite's permission to do anything with bitcoin. If I have the private key, I have the private key.
3) Most importantly, the bitcoin elite can fail. Mtgox was once the biggest exchange. Karpeles had the ear of bitcoin core developers. Mtgox failed and now they are history. Big mining companies can fail. Big mining pools can fail. Core developers can get voted off the island. Users can fork the blockchain and reject new versions and changes. Satoshi can sell all of his coins for British pounds and crash the price back to pennies. But what power does he have after that?

If people in India see a lower than average price of bitcoin in India due to lots of selling pressure from people moving money into India, then they'll buy bitcoins and sell them in a country where the price of bitcoin is higher than average. It's arbitrage. This then this pushes the Indian price up and the other country's bitcoin price down until the prices even out. Self-interested arbitrageurs will do the work of moving money out of India and providing support levels for the price. Isn't that a beautiful thing?

Well monitoring and collecting information is something a lot of businesses have to do. For example, people selling guns or people selling alcohol need to ask for ID and maybe fill out a form. These machines would be serviced. If you want to use it, the attendant would scan your ID and the details of the transaction would be recorded for compliance purposes. I don't see how this would cost $150,000. It would be part of the owner/attendant's job.

He's actually saying that bitcoin won't be hardcore enough for Libertarians:
“I think the relevant comparison point for bitcoin is 1993 or 1994 for the consumer Internet,” said Andreessen, who created the Netscape web browser back then. “It arrived with fringe politics and fringe characteristics. But you just have to go through a maturation process, and along the way, the fringe characters can get alienated.”
Andreessen added, “My prediction is that the libertarians will turn on bitcoin. The libertarians will discover that the blockchain is public,” referring to bitcoin’s public ledger of transactions. While transactions are supposed to be anonymous, it’s possible to view the movement of bitcoin through the blockchain, which undermines that.

Right.  A specific example is that the blockchain can eventually replace the whole convoluted systems of deeds and titles which are often stored in local databases. Title lawyers and insurance companies make mistakes all the time in figuring who owns what and when real estate titles were changed because these records are in local databases and not well organized according to universal standards. This makes property transfers more difficult, time consuming, and expensive for everyone. With the blockchain, you can assign one piece of property to one representative coin or fraction of a coin on a blockchain which is publicly auditable by anyone at any time in seconds. If you have the key, then you have the property. And you can prove you have the key without showing the key to anyone. 
Smart contracts can automate certain processes. A specific example: Imagine that you assign a piece of property to yourself but program it in a way that transfers the property to your heirs unless you provide some key within a specified amount of time -- a dead-hand switch that will execute your will when you die or become incapacitated without using the expensive and time-consuming legal system. If I don't input a certain piece of information within, say, 6 months then my bitcoins go to my son's address. Or I could have the transaction send a certain amount of bitcoin per year if my son is young and I want to make sure he doesn't spend it all at once on a drug-induced spree. 
It's programmable property. Your imagination is the limit as long as it conforms to formal logic.

Who is "we"? It seems that with computer operating systems, only a small percentage of the population wants to use command lines or IP addresses to do anything. If bitcoin is the same, then most people will end up using a user-friendly interface created by a centralized service  which holds the hands of the user. These services will make using bitcoin as easy as Twitter. 
Eventually, I think that less than 3% of bitcoin users will handle their own private keys. This is the percentage of people who bother using Linux.

-Your friend's Swiss girlfriend could steal it.
-Either one of them could get busted for something else and snitch on you.
-The airport security in the US could find the cash.
-The airport security at your destination could find the cash.
-The Swiss banker could steal it. 
-The US government could pressure the Swiss government into giving you up.

Ideally, I'd want a solution where I don't have to trust anyone and everything is automatic.
To do this, I would set up a dead man's switch. It's pretty simple:
If the unspent output (bitcoin) remains unspent for 6 months, then it will be split and sent to Addresses X and Y (my children's addresses) in the proportions that I specify.
Therefore, if I die or become incapacitated, they would simply need to wait for 6 months and everything would be distributed cleanly as I intended. No lawyers. No trust. All I have to do is spend from my addresses once every 6 months to avoid the trigger.
Unfortunately, this isn't currently possible with bitcoin scripting features. I'm pretty much waiting for it to become possible through bitcoin (or XCP or Ethereum, etc.) and easy to set up. Any other method either requires someone to find something or trusting someone to give something to someone else. I want it to be automatic. No multisig. No lawyers.  
I want a dead man's switch: I die. 6 months passes. Everything is done. 
EDIT: Of course, the big security drawback with this is that none of your storage can be truly cold if you need to regularly spend to avoid the trigger.

I think the point you made about the instant and (relatively) bloodless transfer of wealth is interesting. A lot of people are scared about how this unknown person, Satoshi Nakamoto, and other early adopters with hundreds of thousands of bitcoins will become extremely wealthy. But while we consider who the wealth might be transferred to and how they might use it, we should also think about the people who control the levers of wealth *now* and how they are using it. While people like Satoshi Nakamoto may be influential, they won't have nearly the amount of power that the banking elite have today and far less of an ability to perpetuate their wealth over the long term.

If the company pays its supplier in bitcoin but the supplier immediately cashes the bitcoin out for USD, then nothing has changed. You've just slightly delayed the cashout. In the end, you need people to actually hold bitcoin and believe in it. Whether that's the supplier or the middleman doesn't make a huge difference. The most important thing for the price are the investors and companies who hold bitcoin long-term, removing that bitcoin from the supply semi-permanently.

Not necessarily. The broker in India may want that money to go to the UK, America, or Europe as pounds, dollars, or euros. Maybe this broker establishes a relationship with a client in India who wants to get a lot of gray market money out of India. He uses the BTC he gets from Dubai and sells it on localbitcoins.com or on some UK exchange for pounds into the bank account of the client. He takes some rupees from the client as profit in India. Boom. Mind blown.

The article says that bitcoin's future hinges on two things: retailers willingness to accept the currency and traders' faith in the currency. Well, the retailers take no real risk with Coinbase/Bitpay and we've seen large companies start accepting bitcoin. That's not the issue. Buying and holding bitcoin is also pretty damn easy now (for Americans) with Coinbase. And pretty easy for Europeans with Bitstamp. And pretty easy for Chinese. The main thing holding bitcoin back is the fact that people don't want to hold it unless they're speculating.
They don't trust it. They think it could crash at any moment. And you know what? It can. So why hold bitcoin compared to a (relatively) rock-solid USD, Euro, or Renminbi? Tim Draper, as seemingly uninformed as he is, is onto the real issue with his venture. The next step is to make bitcoin accessible to people who *don't* want to hold their native currencies. Make bitcoin available to Argentinians, Ukrainians, Turks, and Cypriots who aren't as pampered as us when it comes to currency and won't mind the volatility.

OK, let me get this straight. 1 BTC will get you 1/21,000,000th of SIDEDOGE at any given time. Then you can unpeg those SIDEDOGE and get the 1 BTC back at any time even if those SIDEDOGE represent less than 1/21,000,000th of the total SIDEDOGE supply? But doesn't that leave some SIDEDOGE being backed by different amounts of BTC than other SIDEDOGE? Wouldn't that destroy the fungibility of SIDEDOGE? Could there be a scenario where my 20,000 SIDEDOGE is pegged to 1 BTC, and your 20,000 SIDEDOGE is pegged to 0.95 BTC?

I don't think it is possible for governments to lose control of money and "accept the new reality." If governments can't control money, then they would need to massively downsize due to the massive decrease in revenues due to tax evasion, capital flight, gray market expansion, and the inability to debase the currency and borrow money. Governments would gradually shrivel up and become ineffectual without control of the money supply. I think that a ban will come either way, and that bitcoin must be able to survive a ban. 
As far as the 1 MB block size and scalability issues: yes, those need improvement.

Bitcoin at $100,000 would leave about [100,000 people]( with holdings worth $1 million or more. There are roughly 12 million millionaires in the world. Some of those folks (the 100,000 holders of 10+ BTC) would have already been millionaires. In the end bitcoin millionaires would account for less than than 1% of millionaires maximum. 
As for billionaires, there are at least 1,645 billionaires in the world. With bitcoin at $100,000, it would add about 70 new billionaires, which is 4%. Not insignificant. The most striking thing would be the fact that Satoshi at this point would have 100 billion dollars. Perhaps he would be the richest man in the world (if he is an individual) and would almost certainly be in the Forbes Top 10. 
So you can see that bitcoin in this scenario is not hugely disruptive, but it would certainly shake things up. The minority of bitcoin rich would be noticeable. 
BTC would only be hugely disruptive if people began to losing faith in government currencies and rushed into BTC causing government currencies to hyperinflate. In that scenario, many current millionaires might find that they are no longer millionaires and even small holders, such as those with 3 BTC would find themselves to be the new millionaires.

The fact that government can only control the Up/Down ramps is the precisely the reason that they will 1) Attempt to destroy the fungibility of bitcoin (by banning coin mixers, coinjoin, stealth addresses, mandating coin validation schemes, etc.) and 2) Completely ban any cryptocurrency with fungibility and anonymity incorporated at the protocol-level. 
Once fungibility is compromised, they will be able to have USA-registered coins and those coins will be illegal to spend in Europe without jumping through hoops and declaring them to the government. They will attempt to institute the exact level of control over bitcoin that they have over Euros and Dollars when it comes to reporting requirements and capital controls.

Insurance companies compete with each other in the same area and customers would choose their insurers voluntarily. Or they can have a china shop with no insurance. It's their choice. So the insurers would not be governments. As for the roads: the owners of roads control who drive on them.  Advanced technology is not necessary. Gates, locks, and private security forces would suffice. If those costs are too much, you can share them with others. A mall owner, for example, might have one security force which all the tenants use. 
You may end up with specific areas of land that are more or less closed off to lots of people, but that will always be counterbalanced by reduced economic activity compared to more open areas. Areas with too much violence will also do worse than areas with a good mix of freedom and restriction. All these areas will have to compete with each other. And low-quality ones will go bankrupt and get bought out by ones with more customers/members/consumers. 
Anyway, minarchists, libertarians, and anarcho-capitalists can argue amongst each other about how necessary the government is. But the point of this thread is that all of these groups believe in dispute resolution and various mechanisms of dealing with fraud, theft and other violations of people's person and property.

Perhaps most people don't see why we would ever want or need "open-source communities," and dismiss them as fantasy, but there are certainly possible future scenarios where these new tools and new modes of social organization may become much more important than we can imagine. It's better that we have these tools and not need them rather than to need them and not have them. Open source, decentralized guns. Open source, decentralized, money. Bring it on.

We can theorize about what would happen without government. Personally, I don't think it has to be a Hunger Games/Mad Max land of chaos and violence. If this sort of social reorganization happens, it will probably start with people experimenting with different systems on seasteads. Also, there will be quasi free areas within States. Later, completely-free territories can expand to land. Peaceful parenting, education, and other things can help to create cultures of nonviolence. And those who do become violent can get exiled and they can go live somewhere else. You won't be forced to interact with people with histories of violence if you're willing to pay to avoid them. 
What you're describing (Mad Max-like bands of roving criminal rapists) sounds like result of some sort of widespread environmental and political disaster like nuclear war.

You reference Satoshi's vision. I'm curious as to what you believe it to be. Here's my idea: I'm not sure that Satoshi's said enough about politics for us to label him a full-blown anarchist, but from Satoshi's writings, I think we can conclude at least two things about his vision: 
1) He is not a fan of central banking and trusting financial institutions. (Genesis block message, hard cap, and the blockchain in general)
2) He saw bitcoin as a tool for privacy. (Non-reuse of addresses built into client, his postings about possible use cases)


In order to ever challenge central banks and financial institutions (point   bitcoin will require orders of magnitude more liquidity. You simply can't challenge the existing financial system with a 5 billion dollar market cap. So where will that liquidity come from? Crypto-anarchists? No. Bitcoin must go mainstream and gain massive liquidity to ever do what we think Satoshi wanted it to do (challenge, or at least be an alternative to the existing financial system). Part of that liquidity will come from e-commerce and integration with big business. 


I think having some people who are solely focused on promoting mainstream bitcoin use is very good for bitcoin. Even if they are self-interested and don't give a hoot about Satoshi's vision, they are still helping to grow the system. 


I think that one of the strengths of bitcoin is that it doesn't require altruism to succeed. Greedy, self-interested people and attackers alike will grow and harden bitcoin. 


I'm not sure bitcoin's userbase was ever really united. The speculators and daytraders will continue to provide liquidity for the rest of us who need to buy and sell at any time of day. The VC guys will keep investing in big companies with mainstream appeal. The big bitcoin companies will make it usable for the mainstream. And the crypto-anarchists will continue to build tools that allow bitcoin users to have privacy and bypass laws (e.g. Coinjoin/Dark Wallet).

Who gets to own the original handmade art and who has to settle for the replicas? Who gets the real chef to prepare his food and who has to settle for the machine-prepared food. Talent is scarce. And even if everyone has their own personal replicators that can make anything, there still must be a way of determining how much rare raw materials you have at your disposal to feed to this machine. Elements in the universe are scarce. How big can my house be? Space is scarce. We're not moving past these small things any time soon.

Why would it need to be equal? Lots of bitcoin moving to India will push down bitcoin prices in India, yes. When the price of bitcoin in India gets pushed too low due to lots of people using it to transfer money to India, then bitcoin loses its efficiency as a transfer mechanism and they'll look towards something else until the price rises to a level where it's profitable again (compared to other transfer mechanisms). Of course, people from the rest of the world who want bitcoin cheaply will likely find ways to buy underpriced bitcoin from India which will always provide some level of price support in India. You and me aren't in charge of planning this. The market will do what it does. When individuals want bitcoin, they'll accept it to settle their accounts. When they don't, they won't. The market will do what it does.

- a top player in the semi-conductor industry (which could make it a dominant player in mining)
- a place with great IT infrastructure, skills 
- the only renminbi settlement center besides Hong Kong and Macau, meaning that Taiwanese banks can exchange lots of Chinese RMB. and Taiwanese companies can do business in China more easily than people from other countries (which means it could be a bridge to the Chinese bitcoin markets)
- a GDP per capita on par with Germany's with lots of wealth in savings
- a dense population (With 2 Robocoins in Taiwan, all 23 million people could get to one in under an hour)
Taiwan could literally be the Corellia of the bitcoin universe. I really hope the government sees the error in its ways.

I agree that the cut-and-run is an issue. If one individual is in a position to cut and run with 700,000 bitcoins, that is a problem. One approach to solving this problem is to have the government pass a regulation saying that "No one employee of an exchange shall be in control of X number of bitcoins." The government will do some topknotch research on best practices and incorporate them into law. Now all exchanges need to follow these best practices to operate legally. They may require a bond equal in value to the customers deposits and require some sort of license. 
I don't think this is necessary or desirable. We'd rather see other solutions develop. For example, if we have one person in control of 700,000 bitcoins, I doubt an insurer is going to insure those coins for anything less than an astronomical price. As bitcoin insurance companies continue to develop and exchanges become more transparent, they will be forced to spread control of the coins over greater numbers of people. Multisignature transactions can help with this.  This will protect the customers and reduce the exchange's insurance premiums. Why? Because the risk of a majority of 10 high-profile people all deciding to cut and run will be much less than the risk of one person doing it. 
You may say "slowmoon, why are you talking about all this theory? What's stopping exchanges from having insurance, multi-sig cold storage, audits, transparency, etc. TODAY?" 
The same thing that's stopping there from being the bitcoin specific regulations for exchanges (which so many are clamoring for) today. These things take time.  Benjamin Lawsky is still developing his regulations, right? Insurers are still developing their bitcoin insurance products. Bitcoin is a toddler that hasn't even started to walk yet. I've read about bitcoin insurance being rolled out by at least one insurer. Coinbase just got a security audit. MTGOX-level failures are not going to repeat themselves ad infinitum in the absence of laws. Exchanges are going to develop their own best practices and I would be willing to bet that they are going to be a lot more sophisticated and responsive to changing conditions than anything Lawsky comes up with. And if people want to take the risk of trading on a fly-by-night operator with the lowest fees and shittiest security in exchange for lower fees or whatever the benefit is, then why not let them have that choice and take responsibility for it?

Excuse me, we are discussing what bitcoin is designed to do. Some folks talk about how bitcoin is "supposed" to eliminate centralization of mining or how bitcoin is "supposed" to prevent wealth inequality. Satoshi, as the designer, is the foremost authority on what bitcoin was designed to do. Quoting Satoshi is not only appropriate, but necessary when discussing what bitcoin was designed to do.


The goal is explicitly written in the beginning of the white paper:


payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a
financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main
benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending.
We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. - Nakamoto, 2008
Bitcoin is a solution to a problem of trusting financial institutions and third parties. The goal is digital cash that requires no financial institutions or trusted third parties. It's very simple.

Barry is being disingenuous here. He knows that the shares have not been transferred to brokerage accounts yet, so shareholders can't sell. They can't sell until that happens. David Rabahany on BCT said last Friday that he estimates that the shares won't be transferred to his broker for 1 business week or longer and that there was **no way to speed it up**. Barry has been saying that GBTC has been "live" since March. For him to have said that trading was "live" in March when he knew that the shares hadn't even begun the transfer process was even more disingenuous. He should damn well know that "live" in common parlance means that both buyers and sellers are capable of putting up bids and asks. We're not seeing high asks. We're seeing no asks. And we're getting direct information from shareholders that the shares aren't transferred yet. So why do you keep saying that it's a matter of seller willingness? That's FALSE, asshole.

20,000 gross income per month on average. But you need to subtract costs to know the real profit. Exchange trading/withdrawal fees, rents, etc. will take away from profits.
If your fee is 5% and you share half the profits with the location owner (as some operators do), that would be less than $500 profit per month including other costs. 
The more the bitcoin ecosystem develops, the harder it will be to continue charging a 5% fee. An instant buy on Circle with a credit card is pretty convenient. 
The cost of actually keeping track of customers and doing KYC would likely make the endeavor totally unprofitable. Small-time operators can get away with setting buy limits and ignoring that for now. 
Personally, I don't think buying an ATM is a smart move right now.

If you read Szabo, you'll see little things that make you raise your eyebrow. For example, Satoshi compares bitcoin gaining its initial value as a "collectible," which is the same word Szabo uses in a long essay on the origin of money. One way or another, Satoshi was very familiar with Szabo's writing. But that also makes sense, because the cypherpunk community is so small. Of course they'd be commenting on the same things and using similar vocabulary.

They are different types of concerns, but neither were concerns of Satoshi. Inevitably, some people are going to mine more efficiently than others. Will this result in one all-powerful mining cartel? I don't think so. I'm eagerly awaiting any conflicts between the miners and the rest of the users. In a world with many competing miners and many competing currencies, my theory is that malicious or selfish miners will quickly find that they cannot take advantage of the other constituencies (e.g. users, exchanges and other services, core developers, etc.) without repercussions. The other constituencies also have weapons.

The woman walking down the street may actively challenge herself and engage with black men at her job and travel to Africa and learn an African language. But do you think it would be racist for her to cross that street to avoid the black man dressed in "black" clothing when she wouldn't avoid the white man dressed in "white" clothing? Is that act racist when she's doing it for her safety and she knows the statistics? Let's say that she doesn't believe the statistical facts have have anything to do with black genetics or anything intrinsic to blacks. I think it's an interesting problem. Clearly, crossing over is an offensive thing that probably reinforces the black man's anger if he sees her do it. But the woman may be small and unable to defend herself. She knows that blacks have mugged a lot of people in that neighborhood and whites haven't. Is she racist?

Would you say it's racist to say a statistically supported facts, such as "Black neighborhoods have higher rates of reported burglaries and 911 calls than white neighborhoods."

Would it be racist for a small girl carrying an expensive purse to cross the street to avoid sharing the sidewalk with a large single black male wearing "black" clothing when she wouldn't have crossed seeing a single white male wearing khakis? I think we can run into situations where it may offend someone to say something or do something, but it may statistically be smart and actually supported by data.

Once a share is sold, it enters the "tradable" aquarium. That share can then trade back and forth 100 times a second if that's what people want to do.

You fundamentally can't decentralize any sort of gold-voucher, whether it's on a blockchain or not. The gold must physically reside somewhere and you need to trust the issuer when he says that all of the gold is still there.

Someone else ( ) says to trust a website to e-mail my encrypted private keys. Ya, you guys are not really getting it. If you want to trust someone (a bank or a website) then you might as well just give encrypted private keys to a law firm and give your heirs the passwords. That's cleaner than your suggestion because the lawyer doesn't have access to the private keys and he would risk losing his license to practice law in addition to criminal penalties for trying to extort you, so he's got a lot to lose if he doesn't deliver the encrypted private keys. And unlike keeping encrypted private keys in a bank, the government won't be able to easily figure out that you've given them to a lawyer. (Whereas safety deposit boxes are known to the government.)
But the point is that 1) I want to trust no one (not even a law firm) and 2) Have the funds distributed automatically. Right now, that's simply not possible. But blockchain technology is going to make it possible.

Measuring the growth or distribution of bitcoin is actually a thorny problem due to pseudonymity, incomplete data, gameable data, false data (e.g. coinmap locations that were accepting BTC but are no longer accepting BTC), which really limits "hard" analysis.

Mark Karpeles didn't first come up with that idea. All Cryptonote-based coins, such as XMR (Monero) have used algorithmic blocksize retargeting. Monero has had it operation for over a year. It's not easy to attack. We can continue to observe its use in other coins for another year or so and even try a spam attack as a stress test. After we're satisfied, we implement it in bitcoin.

The internet in general is definitely a psychedelic phenomenon in that it dissolves boundaries, which is the main thing that psychedelic substances do. The internet dissolves national, political, gender, age, and socio-economic boundaries. Dissolves communication boundaries. Allows people to create, sell, and share their own content with anyone without permission from anyone. Bitcoin is just a continuation of that. It's expanding our ability to communicate with others.  
One of the things that Terence McKenna said was how the mushroom once told him to "find the others": how it was important for people to be able to find like-minded psychedelic people. That is what we're doing with bitcoin. (At least some of us.) We're annoyed with these government bailouts and bail-ins. Mismanaged currencies. Abusive banks. And we're now participating in our own economic community that encompasses our values.
What did Tim Leary say? "Turn on, tune in, drop out."
That's it exactly. We've turned on and gained awareness of the corrupt global financial system. We want no part of it. We're tuning in to something else. And we're dropping out. I get paid in debt-based slave-money and I immediately drop out and change it to real money.

The value is not stored *in* the contract on both sides for much of what you've listed. I can give you a token that says you own 1/100th of my company, and we can put that token up for sale with a smart contract. And you can buy it without any middleman. But do you see where the human verification comes in? My company needs to exist. It needs to be audited. People need to come in and see that I have the skills that I claim to have and the equipment that I claim to have. So you'll probably want to reintroduce the middleman because you'll want actual people to come in and make sure that my company exists and is honest.
The smart contracts aren't truly smart unless the contract itself can verify all the conditions that both parties are concerned with. That includes trustless CFD trading (BitShares is working on this with BitAssets), digital currency exchange (e.g. one coin for another. Ethereum is working on this with EtherEx), and some other situations where the contract can truly handle 100% of what the parties are seeking to do.

There are certainly moments when I contemplate the future and feel a sense of impending dread and doom. It's easy to think of the worst that can happen. Completely locked down and monitored society with worldcoin and nightmarish government intrusion in your life. The imagery of being implanted with chips has a particular way of setting off these feelings. The idea of being physically violated by foreign material against your will. 
But let's not indulge those fears. The coins can be made more fungible. Less trackable. Our people are working on those improvements now. Consider the possibility that the rise of non-government money (whether it's stored on an implanted chip or in your smart phone) coupled with the increasingly large digital economy as part of a wave of societal and technological change moving us *away* from this nightmare. One that renders the modern nation state a shadow of its former self. One bringing us closer to Timothy C. May's vision of more freedom for you rather than less. Or be afraid. Your choice.

If we are using the *consequences* of double-entry accounting to determine its significance compared to bitcoin, then the comparison is premature. 
For example, in 100 years, a blockchain-based currency in combination with new tools (such as DAOs or A.I. or whatever) or alone may be responsible for an increase in productivity of such magnitude that it would eclipse anything seen before it. That includes the increase seen when double entry accounting was used in combination with industrial-age technology. 
Although the actual historical consequences of a given innovation are a very good measure of significance, there's no way for us to know the consequences of bitcoin yet. This lack of knowledge doesn't mean it's impossible for us to attempt to judge it's significance. We can evaluate the properties of the technology itself. 
The blockchain is much more than triple-entry accounting. It's also a new way of issuing money. It's also programmable. It's also cryptographically-secure. It has a more limited supply than gold (considering  that improvements in mining technology might eventually allow for extraction of gold from space). The cost of storing it is near-zero. The list goes on, and it beats the gold-standard of money in nearly every category.
I don't need to see human-level A.I. in action to know that it would be one of the greatest technological innovations of all time. Similarly, I don't need to see bitcoin do what it's capable of doing to know that it's one of the greatest financial ones.

I've always been suspicious of the following metrics: # of mywallet users, # of unique addresses, and # of transactions. All are very cheaply gameable, and there is a lot of incentive for startups and bitcoin companies to artificially inflate those numbers to make it look like the space is growing more than it is. The more bitcoin looks like it's growing, the more investment these companies can get at higher valuations. I'm not pointing any fingers at anyone in particular, but the incentive is there.
If you look at non-gameable numbers like transaction fees paid to miners in USD or USD volume on exchanges with trading fees, they are not really growing at all. There are also updated security and business practices that change the metrics without changing fundamentals. For example localbitcoins.com is now generating new addresses for deposits. Before, you just used 1 deposit address. That alone adds many thousands of new addresses per day. That has nothing to do with gaming the numbers but changes things nonetheless. 
I'd really be looking at metrics that require actual money to go up. USD-based metrics. USD transaction fees paid to miners and BTC-E/Bitfinex USD volume. These kinds of metrics are much better, IMO, and they actually correspond to what we're seeing. A long winter. It's silly to look at some these metrics and see them going exponential when the reality is that we're experiencing a lull right now and the number of businesses accepting BTC in your city might actually be shrinking.

Rai stones are cool, and definitely a sort of spiritual ancestor to bitcoin, but they didn't quite make the jump, IMO. The stones, as a commodity, were still considered to hold the value whether they were in front of someone's house or at the bottom of the ocean. They were just too big to move. But there was definitely innovation there though because the entire community collectively verified and audited the transactions. But it's similar to public auditing that with real property transactions. You transfer and record the deed publicly, but the land is really the thing that we value.

The collapse of the dollar is not protected by insurance. What do you think happens when a currency collapses? The insurance companies give you a bunch of gold? How are you insured? Your *deposits* in the bank are insured, meaning that if someone robs the bank, you still get whatever number of dollars you put in there. But we're talking about a scenario where dollars themselves have become devalued. That insurance isn't going to help you. 
I have no idea what would happen if the dollar collapsed. A currency backed by hard-assets, such as gold, oil, land, etc. issued by a trustworthy issuer (e.g. Switzerland) would probably be popular. I think crypto will continue to gain popularity as well.

1. Sorry, but I don't think you understand the grammar of this post. It's not saying bitcoin is a bigger invention than money. It could be a much smaller invention than Money 1.0 and the title would still be true. It's like saying "Lebron James is the most significant basketball player since Michael Jordan." You wouldn't respond to that statement with talk of how significant Larry Bird or Magic Johnson is, right?
2. The purpose that an inventor has when he invents something doesn't necessarily have anything to do with what the invention is used for and is not equivalent to the function of the invention. Even if Satoshi Nakamoto was a tremendous pothead who created bitcoin solely as a way to buy and sell Buddha online, that has nothing to do with the significance of bitcoin as a financial innovation.

Bitcoin education is good, but there's no need to force it on others. When I set up my remittance company that sends money from America to China for lower fees than all of my competitors because I've figured out how to do it with bitcoin, then my competitors are going to become educated quicker than you can imagine. When Overstock starts consistently offering lower prices than their competitors because bitcoin's fees are lower than Visa's, their competition is going to become educated quicker than you can imagine. And that's because their livelihoods will be on the line. And at that point, learning about bitcoin will cease to be some intellectual, cypherpunk circle-jerk exercise. It will be a necessity.  
In other words, I don't think we're going to need to launch educational campaigns where we correct journalists on inaccuracies in their stories or debate with random people in the comments of CNN articles so that they get the story straight. Just use bitcoin to your competitive advantage and watch how fast they educate themselves.

Having the entire world observe every bitcoin transaction is inefficient. Hard to think of something less efficient. We have to balance decentralization with actually having a scalable system. I imagine using the bitcoin network itself will one day be only for large transactions that require lots of security or lots of smaller transactions bundled together by centralized services.  Small transactions that don't need much security can also be handled by smaller altcoins like dogecoin or whatever and then converted to bitcoin for almost no fee.

On a long enough timeline, all government currencies go to zero. Most government currencies that have been created are now worth zero. They're extinct. There's no exit number. That assumes that I want to hold dollars. I don't. I want to own things that are desirable and scarce (e.g. land, bitcoin, gold) or things that can generate income (e.g. equities, rental properties). Dollars are neither. Government currency is not something you want to hold unless you have to, which you do if you pay taxes. You can play with them and try to daytrade if you think bitcoin is overheated at any given moment, but that's just playing hot potato. 
But to answer your question, I think the market would be past overheated at $1500-$3000 on the current reward schedule (i.e. from now until Summer 2016). I'd start diversifying into other assets starting at around $1500 if we were to get there this year.

I made the mistake of using a simple gentleman’s agreement as the contract. Roger and I are friends. We have enough respect and trust for each other that we both thought a simple gentleman’s agreement would suffice. I did not expect OKCoin will delay or default on payments of $10k in size. For this I apologize. I also did not expect OKCoin would not pay my salary for the time I spent there.
I've never had "v7" of a Gentleman's Agreement. If I were OKCOIN, I wouldn't want to be paying you $20,000 per month to drag the company into one-sided "Gentleman's Agreements" with your "friends" instead of being a professional. Clearly, Ver wasn't treating it as an informal, friendly deal and you should've realized that by the time you'd gotten past v5.

Nope. You can transact with anything. Prisoners transact with cigarettes. Why transact with bitcoin?
I think you were closer to the more likely reason why people assign value to bitcoin in your previous sentence.


We give bitcoin value because, well, we can do some things with it. We can write scripts that can manipulate it. We can send it to people without using banks. And the other important piece is that we give it value because it's **not** literally everywhere. It's scarce. It's useful + scarce. Anything that's useful and scarce will probably attract a buyer.

1. Individual tech nerds can't reliably secure their coins.
2. Individuals can't trust professional tech nerd services such as blockchain.info to secure their coins. 
So what is the conclusion?

Not a comprehensive list, but here are a couple of ideas:
1. Roughly 3600 coins mined per day. Miners sell some of them. This is higher money supply inflation than in the USD. High supply inflation is bad for price. It also has a chilling effect on potential buyers. Big money buyers don't want to pump up the price simply to have miners dump 3600 coins the next day leaving the buyers holding bags. When bitcoin spikes, it only stays at those highs for a week or two. All it takes is for a big miner to start dumping to cause the avalanche. It will take several more halvings to bring the supply inflation down to a low rate. A 2% supply inflation will be much more attractive, but we'll have to wait over five years to get there. 
2. Compared to the effort that it takes to procure and secure it, bitcoin is not very useful. Most people won't use bitcoin unless they must. The pool of people who must use bitcoin is not huge. 
3. If people do use bitcoin, they may only hold them for a few seconds. If I buy bitcoin and then immediately use the bitcoin to send money to the Philippines, maybe I'm in and out of bitcoin within a few seconds. In other words, I create some buy pressure, but then immediately create some sell pressure. The velocity of internet money can be very high. 
4. There's a lot of competition for speculative money. Stock markets in Japan, America, China, Germany, are all doing very well. You can trade with leverage. Some Chinese tech stocks are trading at unheard of price to earnings ratios and they are doubling and tripling. The Chinese speculators willing to chase 1000 PE ratio tech stocks are probably some of the same people who were buying bitcoin. They were in bitcoin in 2013 because it was hot. Now it's not. 
EDIT: 
The good news is that none of these are fatal.  and  decline over time: a) The high supply inflation decreases by design. b) More and more services (e.g. GBTC, itBit, Coinbase exchange, Gemini, COIN) will make it easier and easier to get and secure bitcoin. c) The black markets that require bitcoin are growing. d) Ways to get big discounts shopping with bitcoin (e.g. using giftcard hacks) are becoming more numerous. If people figure out how to consistently get 5-20% off purchases by using bitcoin, then you'll see how quickly all the crumb-bums and coupon-ladies come out of the woodwork.
Truth be told,  will probably get *worse* as remittance services become more streamlined (increasing the "velocity" of bitcoin), but that will be counter-balanced by more people using bitcoin for remittances.
And  will change as soon as bitcoin becomes hot again. Speculators are fickle. 
So just settle in for the long haul. Don't quit your day jobs.

Well, I think Karpeles likely approached at least one bitcoin early adopter to help him cover withdrawals at some point, whether it was in 2011 or 2013. So at least that person knows.
But the investigator should be able to figure it out. They will make Karpeles provide all the MTGOX addresses, hot and cold, and compare the total balance to the customer deposits. Then they'll be able to see whether MTGOX had enough bitcoins to cover the customers' bitcoin deposits. Same goes for bank account statements and fiat balances. And if MTGOX didn't have all the bitcoins or money, they should be able to go back and see for how long this was the case.
We know for a fact that the US government clamped down on MTGOX early on and MTGOX got a bunch of money seized and accounts frozen. We also know that he had some banking troubles in Japan from a leaked telephone conversation with a Japanese banker. So at some point I think Karpeles got comfortable running a fractional reserve so that he could be flexible and pay expenses despite the frozen bank accounts, seized funds, etc. In his head, maybe he justified it by thinking that he was just borrowing against MTGOX's own frozen money, so the loan was "secured." Also, the price had been &lt;$20 for *years*. He figured risk was low. Fees would quickly pay for it. The ends justified the means, etc. At the same time, he got used to a certain lifestyle in Japan. 
Who knows what really happened. We're going to find out. But I believe that this is going to go all the way back to 2011.

It's because he decided that he wanted to value them. There is no kind of value that can exist within an object itself. It doesn't matter if you can eat it or make a spoon out of it. Value can only be created, by definition, within the human mind. If no  human being on the planet wants the cookies you're selling, then how much will they sell for? 0. If a bunch of human beings on the planet want strands of Britney Spears' useless hair, then how much will it sell for? More than 0. The idea that there can be some sort of value "inherent" in the object is preposterous.

This is nuts, but this is kinda making sense. Mark was a fuckup. He couldn't go back to France. He really wasn't all that talented. He wouldn't be able to get a great job. He needed to do something. when Mark Karpeles first discovered bitcoin, he realized that its first use case could be a way for people to pay for drugs online. But with no convenient place to buy and sell bitcoin, it could never work. Mtgox was the afterthought.

Mark was of course an early adopter himself, so there was a good chance that he would've had enough coins in his personal stash in addition to the remaining customer deposits to move a convincing enough amount of bitcoin to calm people down. If he didn't have enough bitcoin himself, I believe he could've enlisted the aid of another early adopter who helped him orchestrate the "moving of the coins" farce. (We know for a fact that he resorted to using another early adopter to calm the masses with Roger Ver in 2013.)

Which brings us at last to the moment of truth, wherein the fundamental flaw is ultimately expressed, and the Anomaly revealed as both beginning and end. There are two doors. The door to our right leads to the decentralized exchanges, uncounterfeitable money, and the salvation of free markets. The door to our left leads back to the Matrix, to centralized, regulated exchanges, central banking, and to the end of our civilization. As you adequately put, Mtgox  was the wake up call. But we already know what we are going to do, don't we? Already we can see the chain reaction: the chemical precursors that signal the onset of an emotion, designed specifically to overwhelm logic and reason. An emotion that is already blinding us to the simple and obvious truth: centralized exchanges are going to continue to fail and there is nothing we can do to stop it. Hope. It is the quintessential human delusion, simultaneously the source of our greatest strength, and our greatest weakness.

["Maybe collectors, any random reason could spark it."]( - Satoshi Nakamoto, on bitcoin's initial value.
It's not a chicken/egg scenario. It's pretty sequential. Bitcoin was a collectible/speculative investment first. A black market currency second. A store of value/medium-of-exchange/etc. last. In the beginning, a few passionate collectors said "Bitcoins are really neat. I'll trade you something for them even though they're virtually useless." Everything else came later. Any collectible (e.g. old baseball cards, beanie babies, or strands of Britney Spears' hair) has the potential to become a currency if it turns out that it has good properties as a currency (i.e. durable, divisible, hard to counterfeit, etc.) I think of bitcoin as a math-based collectible that just happens to have some other qualities that would be good in a currency. The experiment is to see what happens next.

These Filipino maids and laborers in Hong Kong are sending more like $200 bucks back home every month. That's a normal remittance and that's where they're getting screwed. People who have 3000 dollars to send at once would usually have a bank account and do a $15 wire transfer from a HK bank to a Filipino bank.
The real idea of bitcoin is that you get paid in bitcoin, ask your family in the Philippines to give you their bitcoin address, and then just send them bitcoin for 2 cents or for free. Then your family just spends bitcoin. All this talk about how bitcoin's not cheap is assuming that you're just using it as a way to fuck with fiat.
Bitcoin's dilemma is how to bootstrap from current low adoption  (where it's not easy for Filipina maid in HK to get paid directly in BTC from her HK employer or for her Filipino relatives to directly spend bitcoin on rent and food in the Philippines) to high adoption (where bitcoin is everywhere). Obviously most people think it's not going to happen. Otherwise, bitcoin would be worth a lot more than &lt;$300 each.

Corporations already coin currencies. Frequent flier miles. Gift cards. They're just not officially tradeable or accepted outside of those corporate-sponsored locations. Even assuming that a government must be involved, Ecuador is already starting a digital currency. There's no reason why China couldn't offer a pre-mined, proof-of-stake currency backed by gold. You can transfer it anywhere and generate your own address without middlemen. Bring enough of that currency to Bank of China in Shanghai and they'll give you gold. It's just a matter of time before some sort of digital currency becomes a border-agnostic global currency, government-backed or not. Seems inevitable.

Increasing the blocksize (even dynamically) isn't some pie in the sky theoretical shit like sidechains. It's already operational in many altcoins. Don't see this as a big issue. 


Less money gets paid to miners. Mining serves two purposes. 1) Securing the blockchain and 2) delayed+fair distribution. After the block reward is gone, the second purpose goes away. And miners get paid less as a result. Whoever wants to compete for the $170,000 per day can stay in. Whoever doesn't want to can turn their ASIC off and sell it.

Doesn't work with bitcoin.


You took the average. 
Going  back to the first point,  I think wisdom of the crowds works for guessing something like the weight of a bull or the answer to a math problem because you have a group of people in the crowd who actually know how to eyeball the weight of a bull or do that math. You're taking the median, not the average, so a wildly wrong guess that's too high and a wildly wrong guess that's too low cancel each other out. The median guess ends up being closer to what the actual experts in the crowd (who know the right answer) guessed.
For example, everyone's trying to guess the weight of a young 1020 pound bull. You have 11 people. 8 of them are from big cities and 3 of them are Middle America farmers and the guesses are something like this:
1. 200 lb (5 year old child from New Jersey)
2. 500 lb (cityboy)
3. 600 lb (cityboy)
4. 700 lb (cityboy who worked as a butcher)
5. 900 lb (Nebraska wheat farmer with a family milk cow)
6. 1000 lb  (Texas rancher)
7. 1050 lb (Iowa dairy farmer)
8. 1500 lb (cityboy)
9. 1500 lb (cityboy)
10. 2,000 lb (cityboy) 
11. 8,000 lb (super-model blonde from Los Angeles who weighs 100lbs)
So you can see that you end up with a cluster of accurate answers in the middle of all the terrible guesses. So median is dead on because a) the answer is knowable and  b) using the median ends up selecting the answer from people who know what the hell that answer is.  It's not that a bunch of uninformed people making random guesses can somehow magically predict the future. That's not what's going on behind this phenomenon. I don't believe that the future bitcoin price on a certain date can be predicted by the crowds because the median guessers will be guessing just as blindly as everyone else.

Assuming a secure network, the price of 1 bitcoin is probably the single most important factor in bitcoin's success. Without a high marketcap, bitcoin is freedom's ballad played on a microscopic violin. Don't talk to me about "use." Gold doesn't need use to store value. Diamonds don't need use to store value. Things store value because the market decides that they do, and the most accurate indicator of what the market thinks is the price.

No, bitcoin has better properties. 
Storage/security costs for a cold wallet are a lot lower than storing a significant amount of gold. 
Bitcoin is a lot cheaper to transport it around the world. 
Bitcoin's easier to divide.
Bitcoin's harder to counterfeit. Gold is very hard to counterfeit, but people have shaved bars and coins. They've tried to pass off tungsten as gold because of its similar density. It takes longer to make sure it's pure and verify that it's the real thing.
Even if you're not using it as a currency to buy stuff at shops, it's better than gold.

Are bitcoiners just hoping that miners all hold hands and agree not to sell? This thing cannot continue at this price. Speculators are holding this thing up and just letting themselves get dumped on everyday like waves hitting the beach in the hopes of a big payday.
1. There are only about 340,000 people on this planet who own more than 0.1 bitcoin according to rpietila's research: 
2. Most of them are broke.
3. Judging by and bitcointalk.org stats, new users are not exactly flooding into the space.
4. Miners are selling a significant portion of those 3600 coins
Merchants who accept bitcoin are selling a significant portion of coins that are spent. Those coins are not all being replaced.
So where is (a significant portion of) $900,000 per day supposed to come from? I'm not seeing it.

If you don't think there's going to be a major clash between cryptocurrency and governments as we know it, you're out of your mind. The first truly untraceable digital cash will be a strike to government's jugular. Government's trump card is the ability to control money. To tax economic activity through inflation. To seize bank accounts, securities, and other assets. Any sort of peaceful regulation or framework for dealing with untraceable digital cash is just temporary. As soon as they realize what untraceable digital cash will do, it will be all out war. Maybe bitcoin is too traceable, but it's only a matter of time before darkwallets or zerocoin or something makes it untraceable. And then the government is going to scramble to put that genie back in the bottle, foundation or no foundation.

Another very curious question that's burning in my mind is "Who was the owner of the 100,000 bitcoin account that was originally hacked in 2011?" Now if this was an early adopter with hundreds of thousands of coins, then wouldn't that person have a clear motivation to help Karpeles convince everyone that everything at Gox was fine? Wouldn't that be the ideal person to approach? 
I'm actually working on a script for a MTGOX film that depicts this very story. Karpeles would be played as a chubby, over-confident, wheeler and dealer who gets in over his head. Sort of like a cross between Philip Seymour Hoffman in [Scent of a Woman]( and [Before the Devil Knows You're Dead](
Here's a preview:
Karpeles: Listen, buddy, I've got good news and bad news. The bad news is that your account was compromised and it looks like your 100k bitcoin were used to push the market down to .01 USD, which means that the hacker was able to get around the $1000 USD limit and withdraw all your bitcoin.
Early Adopter Bro: Wh-what? Your system processed a 100k bitcoin withdrawal! Have you heard of cold storage? Are you fucking kidding me?
Karpeles: Yes, well that guy was damn clever. I really should've added a bitcoin limit as well. But you'd figure a USD limit would cover both, right?  "Could've, would've, should've." C'est la vie. But listen, I haven't told you the good news.
Early Adopter: GOOD NEWS!? You motherf--!!
Karpeles: Calmate, buddy. Ruhe! Listen, we can make this right. I've got lots of bitcoin. You've got lots of bitcoin. And MTGOX is the only game in town, right?
Early Adopter: ::breathing heavily:: And??
Karpeles: Look, bitcoin has a bright future, and MTGOX is leading us there, but it won't *stay that way* if anyone finds out about this little mishap. Hell, if MTGOX fails, bitcoin could go down with it. What if I told you we could both make out on this and save bitcoin at the same time? Put this all behind us.
Early Adoper: Get to the point, Karpeles. Fast. 
Karpeles: I'm in control of this exchange, right? I can push the price up. I can push it down.  Do you know what our volume was last week?  This thing is exploding. I can make this money back in fees and pay you back in no time and then I take this thing to the moon, but I can't do it by myself. I need your help.
Early Adopter: What do I have to do?
Karpeles: Let's meet up and talk about this. Starbucks near Roppongi Station?

OK, so the top 1000 richest bitcoiners who have, say, a million+ dollars worth of bitcoin each have an incentive to run a full node. That's 1000 nodes. The top bitcoin companies, including miners, with 99% of the market share are maybe a couple hundred companies/individuals. That's 1,100 unique entities running nodes. The rest of us don't really have that strong of an incentive. The incentives are weak. When you have 4 MB or 8 MB blocks, they become even weaker. 


5000 isn't the most confidence inspiring number when half of them could be fake or owned by the same people.

VCs don't throw good money after losing investments. They aren't trading emotionally. This is their profession. VCs throw money at 50 startups and hope that 5 of them are successful enough to make up for the rest. Do you think bitcoin is the only digital currency/payments investment that they are betting on? They are betting on the payments space as a whole, including ApplePay, Stripe, and others. If one of them succeeds, they don't need bitcoin to succeed. If they think bitcoin's a dud, then they'll pull their funding. *They're not married to bitcoin.* They're not going to use VC money to defend bitcoin's price while early adopters dump coins on them. That's not what they do.

I think of it as being engineered to bubble and collapse over and over. 
During a bubble, miners get greedy and start holding their coins, which makes it even easier to push up the price with new money, which makes miners get even greedier. The same happens in the opposite. If miners see we're in a downtrend, they want to get rid of as much BTC as possible as quickly as possible which pushes the price back down to hardcore demand levels. Every bubble is engineered to collapse because there's a constant output of new coins (currently 3600) that will eventually overwhelm demand (think about $1000 * 3600 per day).

To answer your question, I guess you would have to impose some kind of requirement (different from SHA-256 hashing) to receive the full node reward in order to prove, or at least make it less likely, that it's not a bogus node. This would require some creativity.

It's a hardfork either way in your scenario. Either the miners force a hardfork to remove the cap or the rest of the users fight the miners with a hardfork that changes the algorithm.

Well that's the whole problem. The government is not letting them import/export things at a market price. 
Best case scenario, like you said, is for bitcoiners to just visit Venezuela and spend bitcoin there. That will infuse bitcoin into the local economy that they can then trade back and forth among themselves. The problem, I think, is that the infused-bitcoin would leak out of Venezuela or get taken out of circulation because it's such an easy way to get physical dollars out of Venezuela or convert piles of mattress-money to a much more conveniently-held asset.

Couple reasons why it could've been kept up from 2011 through 2012:
1) People would just shout it down as FUD, which happened in 2013. Roger Ver would've gotten on youtube to tell us everything was fine.
2) Withdrawals were working.
3) There were no popular exchanges where you could short bitcoin until years later.
4) Karpeles admittedly controlled all the keys himself and so other Gox employees (just a handful at that time) probably wouldn't have even been aware.
There's no reasonable explanation for why the hacker was unable to withdraw $1000 worth of bitcoin when the price was 0.01 so my conclusion is that he could and he did.

Well, let's bring it out to the endgame. 
10 years later
Block reward is near 0 and there are no free transactions anymore.
The blocksize has been increased to 20-30+ MB as Gavin is talking about now
There are 40 transactions per second, and each transaction has a transaction fee of 0.05 USD
Miners mine purely for transaction fees: .05 (dollars) * 40 transactions per second * 60 seconds * 60 minutes * 24 hours = $172,800 per day in fees up for grabs. 
Feasible? Will the hash rate be enough to secure the network if mining is based purely on transaction fees? Satoshi thought so. We'll see.

Sure, many things are tracked superficially online. For example, we can make a smart contract that automatically pays a merchant when a tracking number is queried and delivery is reported. But then you might open the package and see that the box is full of junk. Then there's a breach. Just saying that most things still require a human being to say "Yes, my requirements have been fulfilled."
And then there's the massive issue of security and compliance. There are a lot of assets that *can* be traded frictionlessly with digital tokens, but we might not want to do it for regulatory reasons. For example, if you could send shares to anyone and then exchange those shares for bitcoin in the blink of an eye, then you could end up with a company getting hacked and having tons of its shares sold off by the hacker in a non-reversible transaction in the blink of an eye. 
Smart contracts are way ahead of their time, IMO. You're really a pioneer here in recognizing their potential. It's going to take a ton of work to get to the point where we can use them on a large scale. But people like you are bringing us closer to it.

And the implication is that "if smart people like him can only be educated properly, they will see the light." My response to that is: Sure, your friend, being an expert on money, could possibly be brought on board the bitcoin train if you sit down with him and explain some of the mechanics and potential applications of bitcoin while clearing up his misconceptions. 
**BUT** I want to share my pessimistic prediction that most people will *never* be well-informed about bitcoin. Adoption of anything doesn't start with people getting a deep understanding of the mechanics of things. They can't tell you how their phone or their lightbulbs or their currency or refrigerator works. My point is that your friend's understanding of bitcoin's mechanics is as good as it's going to get for your average person. The group of people with the type of personality where they are convinced of things in an abstract, theoretical way is actually pretty small. And that if we see adoption among average people, it's going to be more of a monkey-see-monkey-do type adoption.
Most people aren't interested in learning about the mechanics of things. If their car gets them from point A to point B, they'll press the pedal down and get there. They don't want to know about chemistry and physics. Therefore, I believe bitcoin adoption hinges less on education but more on stuff like "Here's how you use bitcoin to save 20% on Amazon." or "Here's how you use bitcoin to send money from China to the US for free." And then they might use bitcoin for 20 years while having no real understanding of how mining secures the network, and while never having seen a private key.

That's actually a good point. Right now, the bitcoin community does a good job of talking up the benefits of decentralization but when you look at the mining pools and exchanges and the development and even the discussion forums, you see that there's actually quite a bit of centralization. There's always a tendency towards centralization because centralized systems are more efficient.
If governments begin fighting against bitcoin in earnest, that's when we will see true decentralization of exchange and true anonymity of transactions in cryptocurrencies. Because then it will be a necessity and not just a talking point.

Abra's business model is a non-starter. Think about it:
 It relies on "tellers" that should, in theory, charge 1.5% (Abra's recommendation) to meet up with you in meatspace in order for you to deposit cash or cash out of the system. 
The average remittance is a few hundred bucks. Do you really think someone is going to meet up with you in real life to make 1.5% of $200? That's $3. They're not going to meet up with you to make $3. 
They're trying to sell this like it's going to be the Uber of remittances, but how could that possibly be true? You can make a (poor) living as an Uber driver. How many remittances would you have to process per day to make a living as an Abra teller? $10,000 worth of remittances every day in $200 or $300 chunks? It's not going to happen. 
There are regulatory issues with money transmission licenses and capital controls in the world's biggest jurisdictions. There are safety issues with people meeting up with strangers to exchange cash.

If your currency is pegged to the dollar, you should keep most of your savings in USD, not bitcoin. If the peg breaks and the local currency collapses, then the USD appreciates against it and you get more purchasing power. If the peg holds, you don't lose anything. Very little downside potential with a good potential upside if the peg breaks. If you use bitcoin as a hedge, there is significant downside potential because your currency isn't pegged to bitcoin. You can lose purchasing power if bitcoin crashes. 
That's how people broke the Swiss bank last year. Swiss francs were pegged to euros. The euro was in crisis and going down. So people just exchanged their euros for Swiss francs a the fixed exchange rate. If the peg broke, the Swiss franc would appreciate against the euro and you'd get more euros. If the peg held, you didn't lose anything. Sure enough, the peg broke and the Swiss Franc instantly appreciated 30%. It was a very low risk trade. 
No peg in history has ever held up. George Soros made a billion dollars betting that the British pound:German deutschmark peg would break. He borrowed British pounds and sold them for deutschmarks. Deutschmarks were getting stronger and stronger. When the Bank of England finally threw in the towel, the deutschmark appreciated against the pound netting Soros a tidy profit.  
I have no idea why governments keep pegging to foreign currencies and why corporations keep borrowing in foreign currencies. People even take out mortgages in foreign currencies. If that foreign currency suddenly strengthens, you can't pay your mortgage. It always backfires.

First, low-value bitcoin also makes it difficult to store value or use bitcoin as a currency without massive slippage and liquidity problems. Interest in the price qualifies as "interest in the technology“ even though *you* personally are not interested in using bitcoin like gold to store your wealth.
Second, low-value means low incentive to mine, which means a low hashrate, which means low security. Low security means that it would be relatively cheap to attack the system and totally screw up your precious colored coins transactions. You should also be interested in the demand for bitcoin as reflected by the price.

I'm a small block guy, but 2 MB is reasonable and it's a show of good faith. Not moving at all from 1 MB shows bad faith in bargaining when the majority of stakeholders support 2 MB. But if it can be shown that a significant number of people will be unable to run nodes without upgrading their hardware and internet if we move to 2 MB, I would reconsider. But because that's unlikely, I support 2 MB.

No single answer. If  every bitcoin holder today refused to sell any amount of bitcoin for any less than $1,000,000/BTC and then someone bought .01 bitcoin for $1,000,000/BTC on all the biggest exchanges, then the market price would be 1 million dollars.

Agreed. I would also add that it's mathematically impossible for a large percentage of the world population to own one bitcoin regardless of the stage of adoption.

Of the major currencies, the yen is pretty much the cheapest currency to borrow. Many forex traders, among others, like to borrow yen. 


Wouldn't be surprised to see most bitcoin trading eventually take place with JPY, especially if interest rates in the US continue to rise. Borrow JPY and then you won't get killed by USD borrowing costs, and if you have JPY and you actually want to get more than a 0% return on it, you can lend it to bitcoin traders. Win-win.
The Japanese government is also much less concerned with capital flight and controlling JPY exchange than the Chinese government. They are not afraid of people selling JPY. 
Having more trading happening in Japan instead of China is better for everyone. If Japan's trade volume were 10x China's and China "banned bitcoin" again, then we wouldn't really care at that point. Which would be nice.

Currencies have narrow money supplies. Also referred to as M0. 
Bitcoin has ~16 million units. Right now they are trading for $770 each. Multiply those numbers together. That is bitcoin's narrow money supply in USD. 
USD has X number of units in its narrow money supply. They are worth $1 each. The US money supply is worth a hell of a lot more than bitcoin.
But those countries in red? They have money supplies that are worth less than bitcoin.

The bitcoin economy would not shrink just because some coins were taken out of circulation. The same business would take place. The same amount of business would just utilize a smaller number of coins.
Throwing a bunch of coins into circulation would not change the amount of business taking place with bitcoin. There are probably a million coins that were mined early on and haven't moved. Throwing those coins into play wouldn't enlarge the bitcoin economy. It would just put more coins in play. We would have the same amount of commerce taking place as we had the day before those coins were put into play. New businesses wouldn't sprout up because those coins moved. We'd just have more coins in play. 
In other words, the amount of business that takes place using bitcoin is independent of the available supply of bitcoins at any given moment. If there are 1 million bitcoins circulating and people are buying and selling $100,000 worth of drugs on the Silk Road, then the unit price of bitcoins will be higher than if there are 10 million bitcoins circulating and people are buying and selling $100,000 worth of drugs on the Silk Road. Because you have the same demand that's utilizing a smaller available supply.
Adding more coins into circulation would just increase the velocity of the coins. People seem to have this idea that if you increase the velocity of the money, that it is good for the unit value of the currency. That's pretty much the opposite of what happens. 
If you want the unit value of bitcoin to go up, you want fewer bitcoins in circulation *and* more people using bitcoin to do remittances and e-commerce and so on. The combination pushes price up. So we're not saying that we want no one to spend bitcoin. We want lots of people to spend bitcoin. But we also want lots of people to save bitcoin. If you have everyone spending and no one saving, then bitcoin will be worth a penny. Because in that case, bitcoin is like a hot potato. Everyone just gets rid of it as soon as they get it. Lots of supply. Not much demand. 
This extreme example may help you: 
Imagine what would happen if the entire Silk Road marketplace had to function using 1 bitcoin as the entire money supply because the rest of the bitcoin was hoarded. Imagine people were buying and selling $20,000,000 worth of heroin and cocaine every day using 1 bitcoin as the entire available supply. What do you think would happen to the value of that 1 bitcoin in that scenario? Would it be worth $830?
Answer: It would be worth a lot more than $830. That's what happens when you have a lot of savings (16 million bitcoin hoarded) and a lot of spending (20 million dollars worth per day) combined.

If the IRS wants to make it easier to tax and monitor bitcoin speculation, they should ask the SEC to approve a bitcoin ETF. Profits and losses will be automatically calculated on familiar stock brokerages and the vast majority of the trading volume will take place via the ETF. Brokerages can then send out the tax forms. Will make it easier for everyone. 
It's the constant delay from the SEC that's making it difficult. Maybe instead of calling Coinbase, which is just one exchange out of many, call up your fellow government agency and try to get some common sense reforms going. The best way to get taxes from bitcoin-related activity is to have trading take place on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Btw, it's not reasonable to record every single bitcoin transaction (whether you're buying coffee or doing a remittance) and calculate your profit and losses. Nobody one does that when they go on vacation and get euros though the exchange rates fluctuate from day to day. It's probably not going to happen with dogecoin either.

You put institutional money in quotes as if you don't know what the term means. Specifically, I'm talking about retirement funds, mutual funds, etc. In most cases, these funds *couldn't* put money on OKCoin if they wanted to. 
And yes, for those who are not limited in investment vehicles, risk obviously plays a role in their choice of trading platform. MTGox was the largest bitcoin exchange. Finex just got hacked for a tremendous number of coins. Bitstamp. Half of all bitcoin exchanges shut down. Would you rather evade a 15% capital gains tax or lose 100% of your money in a hack? This is a question everyone will have to ask when it's possible to trade bitcoin on a safe, insured ETF. 


I'm not making an all or nothing argument that an ETF will solve all the problems of tax evasion. It's a pretty intractable problem that will never be 100% solved. My argument, simply put, is that most trade is going to take place on ETFs once they become available. And that will be where most of the tax revenue comes from. In the current situation, nearly all bitcoin trading offshore, taking place in China, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Hong Kong. So obviously an ETF that brings traders back to the U.S. will be better for tax revenues.

I'm asking about the sequence. Obviously the first gold could've been used by some tribe as jewelry and then that jewelry could've been traded. But in that scenario, it was being used first as jewelry, then as a store of value. Both before being used as money. In other words, the money use came LAST.

Spending bitcoin is not "better" than saving it. You need both. It's all part of the ecosystem. You can see this easily by taking both to the extremes. If everyone saved bitcoin and didn't spend it, there wouldn't be a market because you wouldn't be able to buy bitcoin from anyone. If everyone spent bitcoin and never saved it, bitcoin wouldn't have any value because everyone would be getting rid of their bitcoin (trading it for something else) as soon as they got it.

Absolutely right. This Bitlicense will influence the regulatory regimes of other US jurisdictions. I am a New Yorker, born and raised. I ordered a Lamassu in 2013 and was excited to find a partner with a good venue. After seeing what Lawsky was proposing, I knew the regulations would make it impossible for a little guy like me to comply. I resold it to someone else. That Lamassu then went to a buyer in Mexico. 
More and more states are going to adopt onerous regulations and the same thing will happen on a larger scale. The bitcoin industry will be shipped to China. People think Donald Trump is a joke, but he's one of the only people talking about this. Americans are absolutely screwing ourselves in trade and jobs and all of this business is going to get shipped off to Mexico and China because we have stupid, incompetent leaders.

Political positions are literally bought and sold. [Here]( is a concrete example of politicians *literally* bought and sold (and you know I was speaking figuratively). Before you say that Blagojevich, the 40th Governor of Illinois, is an isolated example, please realize that Blagojevich's predecessor George Ryan, the 39th governor of Illinois, served 5 years in prison on corruption charges. Dan Walker, 37th governor of Illinois went to federal prison for bank fraud, OK? And before you say that these are three isolated examples, please realize that Otto Kerner, the 33rd governor of Illinois also went to prison for corruption after receiving 17 counts of various corruption-related crimes such as fraud and bribery (i.e. being BOUGHT). This is politics. Don't think that Miami or New York or LA are much better.
Is that specific enough? Now let's also consider that Illinois is a major, major population center (fifth largest state) in one of the most populous countries on Earth. Chicago is the third largest city in the country. And let's also consider that America is actually considered one of the LEAST corrupt countries compared to China, Russia, India, and other large-population countries. Now if politicians are routinely bought and sold in Illinois and Chicago, do you have any idea of what's going on in Russian cities? Brood on it. 
You think Mitt Romney wasn't bought? You're being naive. Matt, you're glib. You don't know the history of politics. I do. Study history and then come back and tell me that politicians are not bought and sold. You're not a baby, okay? I shouldn't have to explain this to you.

We may be saying "Look how NY is isolating itself with its backwards policies!" now.

Ripple and blockchain based alts aren't doing too hot either. Paypal, Square, Applepay, Google wallet, and other fiat-based products (including Visa, Mastercard, etc.) will continue improving and competing fiercely for payments while bitcoin developers are mired in a civil war and the price continues to fall with no real killer app in sight.  I think we'll eventually see a bunch of bitcoin companies go bankrupt. The ones with tons of cash, like Coinbase, can survive $50 per bitcoin and piss-poor volume measured in USD. Others can't.

Bitcoin's market cap is currently $ 3,299,971,042. Bitcoin companies are worth much more than bitcoin itself. The absurd valuations of these companies will not remain absurd. Many will bite the dust.  Coinbase will survive because they have gobs of cash. But they're not going to "pivot" to ripple or an altcoin as they've likely told their overmoneyed investors. They're going to feel the pain like Twitter and Linkedin and everyone else.

$75 per customer. and they charge roughly a 1-2% fee for their services (payment processing, bitcoin purchasing). That means they need the new customer to do $3750-$7500 worth of business just to break even. Most new users are never going to pay $75 in fees. They aren't buying $10,000 worth of stuff with bitcoin. What Coinbase is trying to do is use their piles of VC money to attract new users *at a loss* so that they can continue showing high user growth for their powerpoint presentations so they can continue getting more VC money at higher valuations and avoid a downround. Eventually they want to sell Coinbase to a bank for billions. They're not actually trying to earn money through a sustainable business model. It looks like the next global economic crisis is imminent if not already beginning and it's going to be very ugly for companies that don't have sound business models (e.g. most bitcoin companies, including Circle and Coinbase). Coinbase owners are praying that Visa or some big bank is stupid enough to acquire Coinbase for 1 billion. And they just might be. It will be amusing to see who is left holding the bag.

It's funny ... if authorities would simply keep payment channels reasonably free and intervene sparingly, then these prostitutes would continue using easily-monitored, easily-manipulated legacy payment systems. Governments could continue to selectively prosecute their enemies and bitcoin might never gain a critical mass. The world's authorities are just completely unable to restrain themselves in their neverending quest for total control. They actively pushed people into alternative payment systems like e-gold, liberty reserve, and now bitcoin. 
The most powerful kings and queens of England were satisfied with having a *tiny* fraction of the control that today's governments exercise over economic activity. Yet it's still not enough. They need to control every payment to every individual and decide who gets to play and who doesn't. But they are going to find bitcoin a little harder to shut down than the others. And when they see that they've pushed all of the internet's System D payments into cryptocurrency, and that the software has been modified so that it scales, and that it's now impossible to shut down, there's going to be an "Oh shit. Hit CTRL+Z! We liked things better before! Please come back! Use VISA!" moment.

This is such a good point. $10,000 was the big number that you had to declare at airports and explain at the bank 30 or 40 years ago. But $10,000 in 1970 was worth closer to $60,000 now, and the $10,000 limit is never being adjusted upwards. So effectively, the limit is just getting smaller and smaller every day. None of us get to vote on it because no law has to be passed for the limits to get smaller. In another few decades, you won't be able to use cash to buy anything except a bag of groceries without someone filling out a form. Meanwhile, cops will stop you in your car and take your cash. This is leading to complete totalitarian control of everyone's money and zero privacy. And no one really cares.

it's gotten to the point where you don't even see your money. Your employer withholds part of it and gives it to the government. Then the rest goes directly to the bank. The bank sends you a piece of paper saying that they definitely have it. And if there's any problem with the economy, they'll just lock you out and do a bail-in for the good of the nation.

Bitcoin, with its fixed supply, will do better during inflation. USD or Swiss Francs will do great during deflation. If you hold cash, you might be able to buy stuff for 50% off (including bitcoin, unfortunately). 
But bitcoin is part of the global market. While some currencies undergo deflation, others might be undergoing inflation. You might have China, Australia, Canada, Norway, etc. struggling against *inflation* while America, Switzerland, and Japan struggle against *deflation*. Since most bitcoin is traded in China, China's weakening currency can help bitcoin more than the dollar's strengthening hurts it. 
Or perhaps some other factor or use case dwarfs both of those forces. 
Very hard to say. But governments act quite predictably in the face of deflation. They start spending and creating shittons of money like FDR did. So even if there is lots of deflation all over the world, just hodl tight... inflation will follow and that's when you are going to want fixed supply, uncensorable, privately held money.

Bitcoin isn't easily seized by the government. With improvements, it won't be easily tracked. This is inherently threatening to leftists. They don't want cash to be hidden or smuggled around because then you could avoid taxes. Taxes are the fuel for the leftist machine.  They want all your money on their computers with their gatekeepers and their surveillance mechanisms (automated AML/KYC/bank account analysis software/tracking software). When you drive around, you pay for gas. If you're forced to pay with a card, then your movements will be tracked and recorded because they see each gas station where the charge originates. If you pay with cash, it's a bit harder. They'll have to sift through video camera footage. The government just wants total control. That's the endgame. If you look around, there are very few people who are resisting or even aware of it.

The fact that he admits that nothing backing bitcoin "can work" shows that his mind is somewhat open. I'm a huge fan of bitcoin and have been for years, but I don't find his comments unreasonable. He's right to say that bitcoin is a solution to a problem (inflation, rampant money creation) that doesn't really concern most people *right now*. He's also right that money can move around in the digital world pretty well *right now* even in countries with capital controls. 
Theoretically, bitcoin could save you a lot of money if you're a retailer and your profit margins are low. Theoretically, it can save you a lot of money if you're sending money in certain remittance corridors. Theoretically. Liquidity and lack of a critical mass of bitcoin users currently negate bitcoin's effectiveness in these areas. So it's true that most people don't have a need for bitcoin and won't see a need for bitcoin until we see some significant developments in both the bitcoin ecosystem and the world economy at large.
What Krugman glosses over (or fails to recognize) is the possibility that those developments (such as currencies falling apart, bail-ins, rampant money creation, and rapid growth of the critical mass of bitcoin users) can all occur very quickly. And they probably *will* happen very quickly if you look at the history of depressions and currency crises and technological revolutions.

Yes, I read that article a long time ago. If you think about it, bitcoin, with privacy tools, would be a perfect currency for corrupt government officials. So many corrupt officials are caught by investigators following the money trail. 
You may have corrupt governments scrambling to pass anti-bitcoin laws because of capital flight. At the same time, the very officials passing anti-bitcoin laws may be accepting bribes in bitcoin or converting government assets into bitcoin for their personal use in Geneva or London because there would be less of a money trail (assuming privacy/fungibility tools). They would be privately participating in the same capital flight that they publicly oppose. 
Another example could be CIA or FBI investigators who are following money trails. They may use bitcoin for their own personal and organizational slush funds (to fund their "gray" activities and store their "gray" profits) while, at the same time, prosecuting people who are using bitcoin for basically the same reasons.
So, if bitcoin grows, it'll be very realistic to see it infiltrate all sorts of organizations and "turn" people. The reason we're not seeing this happen, I think, is because it's still too easy to use cash and banks to do this stuff.

Putting all of your money in one thing is not smart, and I don't advise anyone to put 100% of their life savings in BTC, but it's an interesting thought experiment. Six years ago, I was a fan of bitcoin, but I would not have risked my life savings on it. Today, I no longer see fiat currencies as rock solid. Bitcoin may have problems, but at least there's a sane monetary policy built in. I actually feel more confident that bitcoin will exist 10 years from now (with the same purchasing power) than I do about many government currencies. 
What if it takes 6 years for a person's sentiment to change from "I'll experiment with this cool tech" to "I feel safer in bitcoin than my local currency"? If that's the case, then in 2019-2020 we're going to get a large cohort of people who got into bitcoin in late 2013-2014 finally reaching the stage where bitcoin becomes their true currency of choice. Therefore, I think 2020 is going to be a watershed year with a sea change in sentiment. 
This time period also coincides with the next block halving, when the growth of bitcoin's money supply will go from around 4% to under 2%, which will be lower than almost any government currency. 
More and more, 2020 seems like it's going to be a glorious year for bitcoin.

Oh, so you know exactly what I'm talking about. Wealthy is good, but there's no way I would say that someone with a 1 or 2 million dollar net worth isn't "wealthy." That's selling them short. At the same time, lots of people with 1-2 million are still worrying about bills. 
There used to be this convenient word "millionaire" that really meant you could pretty much do what you wanted and not have to worry about money ever. That's how they use it in Sunset Boulevard. Maybe "independently wealthy" works. I think the cutoff is around 8 million. (so that you're earning 400k+ passively).

I don't think it would take Elon Musk very long to grasp what bitcoin is, and as one of the guys who invented Paypal, I'm certain that he bee-lined straight for Satoshi's white paper. He's a busy man and he may have skimmed it, but there's nothing he said that suggests that he doesn't understand what bitcoin is. What some of you missed in the clip is 3:20 where he says bitcoin "will be useful for legal *and* illegal transactions *otherwise it would have no value for illegal transactions.*" He quickly follows with "I don't own any bitcoin."  
This is how public figures (who need to play nice with government to run their businesses) all speak. They must couch all statements in disclaimers and make a point of acknowledging the controversy. Bill Gates, for example, called bitcoin a techno tour de force yet he then  immediately talked about how the anonymity was an issue and how government will play a big role. 
Musk is fairly clairvoyant here. Aside from speculators, criminals have the most compelling current use case for bitcoin. As liquidity, ease of access, and security improve, it will become more and more useful for legal transactions, but currently it's only marginally useful for legal transactions. We've run the numbers multiple times here: bitcoin doesn't really outclass Western Union's rates when you are trying to send fiat from one location to another. Purse.io and brawker create some incentives to shop with bitcoin, but they have their share of issues. And bitcoin itself is not widely accepted or liquid enough to use without converting it. So yes, its best non-speculative use case is for doing illegal transactions where legal money transfer mechanisms are avoided. 
If bitcoin survives this terrible bear market and eventually becomes ubiquitous, it'll likely be due to its baseline demand from the one group of people that actually *needs* bitcoin. The one group of people who must constantly accept, hold, and  use bitcoin to run their businesses. Criminals. If that makes you feel uncomfortable, then go home.

Regulations are what make traditional payments expensive. Think about it from first principles. It doesn't cost much to get a banking partner, have a pile of money in Country A and a pile of money in Country B, pay people in either country. Occasionally send a big wire transfer and re-balance things. Hedge with forex options. If those remittance firms get big enough, they won't be doing it for any cheaper than WU. The regulators will make them pay tons for compliance. I highly doubt that all these bitcoin remittance firms have money transmitter licenses in all the states where their customers live.

It's related to this because that's why the IRS classified it the way they did. They knew if they said "Treat it like any other currency" then they'd get less money. That's really the problem here.

You will see how many fucks he gives when they tell him he'll get 20+ years when found guilty at trial like they told Shrem. He clearly comingled the funds and used client funds for his personal use, at least at the end. The simple facts are that he didn't have a separate account and he knowingly didn't have the clients' cash towards the end. And he was spending money until the end. So there's no other conclusion except that he was embezzling money. He can confess and do 4-8 years like Shrem or he can go to trial, lose, and do a lot more time. They may even detain him without trial for a long time just to pressure him even more. He will confess.

That's more true with CPU/GPU mining because you can just turn on more machines. With ASIC mining, there's a certain number of machines that exist in the world and a limited production capacity of more ASICs. And there's a long lead-time if you want to increase that production capacity because of the complicated manufacturing process. The price of bitcoin was $1000 when the difficulty was much, much lower than it is now. So yes here will be more miners who *want* to enter the market but they cannot act quickly. It may take them a year to respond to a big enough change in the price.

The problem is not the one thing. It's the trend. The trend is a slow but steady increase in surveillance . And it never goes in the opposite direction. So America gets attacked in 9/11 and we pass the Patriot Act so the government can do what it needs to do to track terrorist finances and prevent terrorist money laundering. But was it temporary? Did we ever say "OK, great. We can get rid of those emergency measures now." Nope. It just keeps going. 
FATCA is another one. That forces foreign entities all over the world have to keep track of Americans and report back to the US government. As I said, in 1970, reporting movements of $10,000 worth of stuff were totally different. It was equivalent to $62,000. Within our lifetimes, $10,000 will become a tiny amount. Do you think lawmakers are going to adjust the limits upwards? Or will they just leave it at $10,000 and force you and all the banks and businesses you're dealing with to fill out forms detailing the source of your funds every time you buy a new toilet? It's going to be the latter. 
We accept this because the reporting requirements and surveillance just gets a little bit worse every year so it doesn't seem like a big deal. If you suddenly told Americans in 1950 that they had to do all this, they would've gone apeshit.

The idea that Gavin would be unemployed for longer than about 10 seconds after quitting the Bitcoin Foundation is a complete joke. People want us to believe that Gavin would be some laid-off schmuck down on his luck without the Foundation. LOL. Do you think 21, inc. or Coinbase or any of these companies with tens of millions or 100+ million dollar VC investment wouldn't pay 100k per year to hire the undisputed leader of bitcoin development? Gavin could easily find a company to hire him to sit around and do nothing. Even Andreas, with his bitcoin-celebrity, was able to finagle his way into a job at blockchain.info. Even reddit hired some idiot to work on cryptocurrency projects full-time until they realized he was spending all his time reimplementing bitcoin in Javascript. BUT I GUESS NO ONE WOULD HIRE GAVIN TO WORK ON CORE DEVELOPMENT TO KEEP THE PROTOCOL RUNNING. 
It's absurd. Large stakeholders with large bitcoin businesses have no choice but to help develop bitcoin. Even if they don't, hobbyists will do it. There is absolutely zero risk to bitcoin of simply dissolving the foundation tomorrow. The price is already on its way back down to the 100s. Maybe we need to just go back to our roots like in Rocky III. Train in some shitty gym and get back the eye of the tiger. There's too much fluff and too many hanger-ons in bitcoin now.

Bank accounts don't have $12 monthly maintenance fees in Taiwan like we have in America. Foreigners with visa-free entry or tourist visas can instantly open bank accounts if they go to the immigration building and get an ID number. IMO, Taiwan's banking system is too good for bitcoin to be useful for much more than speculation. It's a very dense country with a stable currency, lots of ATMs and convenience stores, and cheap payments solutions.

Economic totalitarianism is inching forward at a slow enough rate that people aren't noticing it.
In the 1960s, you could carry whatever money you wanted in cash on planes, buy houses and cars with cash, or deposit it with no worries.
In the 1970s, $10,000 (then worth $62,000+ in today's dollars) became the number. Inflation made that number worth less and less without the government needing to change the law. 
The US government now requires banks to report transactions as small as $1000 to $2000 if they are "suspicious." 
Then you look at cash seizures. It used to be that cash was only seized from big time criminals. Now half of seizures in Washington D.C. are less than $150. People are getting pulled over and the police will seize $20. 
Now Bank of America and Chase need to see ID to process $50 cash deposits. 
Imagine 10 years from now. I wouldn't be surprised if cash is banned entirely in at least one country.

There isn't enough money in bitcoin right now to send a million dollars through the system without causing chaos. In scenario 2, you're talking about even less money + loss of interest. In that scenario, I'm not sure how attractive that would be to major money launderers, drug smugglers, etc. It would have to build up value through small-time criminal activity first, like Silk Road/poker-type websites before it had enough volume and liquidity to attract any sort of Swiss Bank money.

Right. What will happen is people will twiddle their thumbs and delay, hoping that the economy will turn around or that the government will save everyone. Then, BAM, deposit accounts will be frozen and people will only be able to withdraw peanuts per day. The smart Chinese have been getting money out of the country for the past 5+ years and buying foreign real estate in Vancouver, NYC, London, etc. The dumb ones are going to lose even more money and then not be able to access their money at all. Sure, people can liquidate the gold in the safe or the money under the mattress and turn it into bitcoin, but bitcoin isn't going to be a big player. Then when you think about the velocity of money and how little time people will be holding bitcoin when they use it to skirt capital controls, it becomes clear that this won't do much for bitcoin's price.

Good point. What will end up happening is that the volatility will be reflected in the price of the "stuff" he bought for $1000. No one will sell their stuff at such narrow profit margins that the volatility of BC could turn their profits negative as they unload the BC.
But keep in mind that black market profit margins are relatively high because of the risk premium and the lack of taxes. For example, Bitcoin volatility in a single day wouldn't be high enough to turn a 30% profit (low for most drug sales) negative. So any adjustment in the price would likely be slight if necessary at all.

Private sales have an effect on the price. If you're buying up all coins in sight on irc or in your city, demand goes up and price goes up. Similarly, you can't just take your 59,000 BTC and dump them in  or in you city at the Mt Gox price to avoid making the price fall while you sell..it's not that easy. Trust me..if it were, big sellers would never sell on exchanges. I'm a BTC fan. You're a BTC fan.

So sorry to hear that. $3000 is a big hit. 
I had a problem with a major bank in the US and I took them to small claims court. Before I filed the claim in small claims court, I would call and be on hold for 30 minutes and transferred from person to person and just got strung along like you said. After I filed the claim, I got a direct number to a guy at the legal department who immediately said "Maybe we can resolve this." I ended up getting a settlement check.
When the bank saw that you were both living outside the USA, they probably thought:
a) There's a good chance that these guys living outside the US actually are the scammers and
b) Even if they're not the scammers, there's very little chance that these guys will be able to succeed during adjudication because they can't show up to court and we've already blocked them out of online banking and most judges don't understand bitcoin, etc. etc. 
So it made sense for them to give the other victim the money and just wait for you guys to fail or give up.

No one will ever go after the MITM scammers because it's too hard. If you go to your local police station and describe it to some guy behind the desk whether you're the truck buyer OR the bitcoin seller, they'll give you a copy of the police report but they will do absolutely nothing. 
In this case, the truck buyer would've been screwed without Judge Judy. Would the truck buyer really have sued the bitcoin seller in actual court across the country, found assets that you could go after, and recovered any money? Probably not. The only reason the bitcoin seller showed up was because he was paid to appear by the show and the show paid the damages.
In your case, you were the one who got screwed. Going to the police would do nothing, and the bank will stonewall you until you actually initiate legal action. 
Meanwhile, the scammers have $3,000 and they will just keep going and no one will make even the slightest effort to find them. It doesn't matter how many accounts BoA closes. The scammers don't need 1 account. They are in the middle so they'll use anyone's account.

Multisig doesn't guard against this. Remember, the bitcoin seller doesn't know that a scammer is selling a fictitious car. The escrow agent with the third key doesn't know there's a scammer selling a fictitious car. The scammer will say "Money's been deposited! :)" and the escrow agent will ask the seller "Did you get the money?" and the seller will say "Yeah, everything looks good!" and then the escrow agent and seller will simply release the coins. Maybe it'll be a week later when some other guy shows up asking for his car and threatening to sue you.

I wonder. Institutional investors don't like to overpay. Especially overpaying on the premium and management fee on a near-pink sheet stock. Usually institutional money likes to [get in ahead]( of retail investors, just after the "smart money." If institutional money thinks bitcoin has a future, but waits for the COIN ETF, they may be uncharacteristically late to the party. If they don't pay a 10% premium now, lots of retail investors may be in with a much lower cost basis if bitcoin is at $500 or more when COIN launches. Will GBTC force their hands? Or will it be a flop? Market doesn't seem very excited about it. 
@_date: 2015-03-05 09:10:09
Yes. If you have unlocked BTC that can be sold through GBTC, why not sell them for a premium, reinvest in BIT, wait another year, and just do it again and again? It's a low-risk way to increase your bitcoin holdings as long as you're willing to lock up your investment for a year. Those easy gains should attract even more capital to BIT, and it should cause a positive feedback loop until supply is high enough that there's no longer much of a premium.

Depends on the person.

This isn't an exchange-level issue. It's a protocol-level issue. Everyone needs to be aware that bitcoin transactions are traceable and that you need to be careful about which bitcoins you accept.

As an ex-LBC seller, here is a list of things you can do to make you, as a seller, unattractive and inaccessible to these scammers:
1. Limit the transaction size. $1000 to $5000 is the range that these car scammers are looking for. If you sell your bitcoin in &lt;$500 amounts or less, it becomes much less worth the scammer's time because it's difficult and time-consuming to find and dupe their victims. It also makes potential losses more palatable. 
2. Don't just have them write "for bitcoins." Make them write: 1) to [your username] on localbitcoins.com, 2) from [their username] on localbitcoins.com, 3) For buying bitcoins, 4) the reference number. Add anything else you can think of. The point is to make them write so many details about the transaction on the receipt so that the car-buying victim has to have a 75 IQ to not get suspicious and refuse to deposit or cooperate.
3. Check their IP address and see if they are in the state and country where the deposit was made. Lots of foreign scammers are too lazy or dumb to even get behind a proxy so this screens them out. Refuse deals with anyone using TOR.
4. Refuse deals with anyone who doesn't have at least 10 different transactions with decent volume and a few different users. After a scammer pulls off a scam, their account becomes useless and they have to start news ones. You'll screen out innocent newbies along with the bad guys and it may take longer to sell, but that's not your problem. Other sellers who want to charge more or work with newbies will sell to them. Their bank accounts will get closed a lot sooner than yours and they'll have to fight fraud a lot more often than you.
5. If you've done all that, but for some reason you still feel suspicious (maybe because of weird delays or some other reason), you can just tell the buyer that you need more verification such as a picture of them holding their ID or a text message. Or you can tell them that you want to hold the bitcoins for a certain amount of time. See if the verification matches and then hold the coins and see if anyone complains to your bank or something about a car deal within the next few days.
Or, you can do what I did:
Use  to sell coins. They have years of experience filtering out scammers and will guarantee your money anyway so it's not your problem. It's really a no-brainer. Selling on LBC is not fun. Even the best, most careful sellers have to deal with fraud and getting bank accounts closed. BitQuick will make it much easier.

Yes, even that's not foolproof. Scammers can even convince the car-buying victim themselves to write various things on the receipt (even "for bitcoins") and the victim might do it, believe it or not. The scammer just makes an excuse like "That's just how we label our receipts for accounting purposes because we put a certain amount of revenue into bitcoin" or some nonsense. Then the victim will end up writing "for bitcoins" on the receipt and sending a picture to the scammer and the scammer just sends it over to you, the bitcoin seller. 
There's no 100% way to avoid a MIITM, but the rule is thus: the more verification you ask for, and the more you know about the person you are communicating with, the less successful the scammer will be and the more likely scammers will avoid you as a seller. 
We have to understand the scammer's mind. The scammers are looking for sellers that will do large transactions and ask few questions. This is because it takes a lot of effort for them to find someone dumb enough to ignore all the warnings on Craigslist or eBay motors about scams and then deposit thousands of dollars into a bank account to buy a car without seeing the car. 
As an ex-LBC seller, here is a list of things you can do to make you, as a seller, unattractive and inaccessible to scammers:
1. Limit the transaction size. $1000 to $5000 is the range that these car scammers are working with. If you sell your bitcoin in &lt;$500 amounts or less, it becomes much less worth the scammer's time because it's hard to find victims.
2. Don't just write "for bitcoins." Make them write:  1) to [your username] on localbitcoins.com, 2) from [their username] on localbitcoins.com, 3) For buying bitcoins, 4) the reference number. Add anything else you can think of. The point is to make them write so many details about the transaction on the receipt so that the car-buying victim has to have a 75 IQ to not get suspicious and refuse to deposit or cooperate.

Yes. US debt is denominated in dollars. If we were to raise interest rates, the dollar would get even stronger than it is now and the US would struggle to pay even the interest on its debt. 
And although raising rates attracts more money to US bonds which the US sells to generate income, that just delays the problem because a) foreigners need to get dollars in the first place to buy the bonds (which makes the dollar even stronger and US debt even more unpayable) and b) the US needs to pay interest (in dollars) on all the bonds that it sells 
There are only two solutions. 
1. Default on the debt and have severe, destabilizing, economic pain for a year or three. 
2. Print shitloads of money to devalue the dollar enough so that the US can continue paying interest on its unpayable debt.
Of course, only  is politically feasible.

Of course the endgame of mining is that it's going to be dominated by people who have free electricity. Just think about it: there are lots of big companies with flat rates on electricity or state owned enterprises that are so big that they won't notice the sons and nephews and friends of management sucking tons of power for their personal (bitcoin-minting) use. 
There are also big power companies that have electricity that is wasted every day because they can't store all the excess power they produce at a given time. The people who run these companies and their associates are in the best position to mine bitcoin, not some guy in his basement. The market is going to reflect that more and more over time. All of these sources of "free" electricity are just there for the taking. When the basement guys sell their equipment, the guys mining with zero electricity cost will buy up their equipment for pennies and turn them on because fuck it, why not? Pile em in until you have no more space. 
Anyone who isn't mining for free will eventually get killed.

I still don't get how it would work. Let's say there are 4 major banks in a country like Australia that want to keep a ledger between themselves for domestic wire transfers. How does a private blockchain help secure the system? Those four institutions would have at least one person with the authority to push and reverse transactions on the network. Hack one person with access and fuck the whole network up.

Mining is at the point where they can't make any more big jumps. They had big jumps from CPU to GPU to 1st gen Asics, etc. Now we're getting down to 28 nanometer chips and there aren't going to be any more big jumps. The only way forward now is through efficiency. I wouldn't be surprised if their plan is just to build a gigantic ASIC factory and worry about the rest later. Elon Musk is doing the same thing with batteries with the Gigafactory. You don't need to make some big breakthrough. You can reduce the cost of production 20-30% or more by just doing it really big.

You say that as if Russia gave away the currency for free in the first place. It's not a artificial peg like what the Bank of England tried to run. You set aside the oil as you issue the currency. If the currency goes down to the price of oil, and people demand it, then you simply give them the oil. A bankrun doesn't break the bank if you actually have the money. But in the meantime, the currency likely becomes worth much more than the oil it represents, so as you issue new rubles, you earn the difference between the premium and the price of the oil backing it. You run it like a business. And if the customers want to turn in the currency for the oil it represents, they can. And they'll likely be selling their rubles at the bottom.
I think the bigger reasons why this isn't done is that it 1) puts a limit on how much currency you can issue at a time (which is not flexible enough for today's world leaders) 2) may put your economy at the mercy of those who can manipulate the price of oil, and 3) would majorly piss off some powerful countries.

It can be set up so that, if things go smoothly, the buyer can voluntarily release the money to the seller (paying 0 fee to a third party). Thus, only in the event of a dispute does the third party perform any examination or collect any fee. Assuming that most transactions go smoothly, the smart contract would usually be fast and free.
This could substantially cut down on fraud in situations where you are hiring one guy or a small firm to do a small job and he wants half the money upfront. Either party could screw the other party. (e.g. The contractor takes the money and doesn't complete the job. The purchaser stiffs the contractor even though the job is fully completed.) Involving a lawyer or spending a morning in small claims court is too expensive. Not to mention the situations where you might be hiring a guy in India to do data entry or transcription work where legal recourse is limited. 
But generally, I agree with you that smart contracts are a bit overhyped.

Yes, because currency unions seem to be working so well. 
Here's an idea: back each unit of your currency with a small, fixed amount of oil (worth less than the ruble is now) and see what happens. That at least would put a floor on the decline because you can always turn in your rubles and get oil. Then everyone would rush in to buy a ton of it because it's the only currency backed by anything besides military might (which Russia also has). In the end, he won't ever have to give up any oil because the currency will be so much stronger than the oil it represents. Putin will basically have a license to print money as long as people think Russia has enough oil to back it up (yes) and that he's good for it (yes). Risky? Yes. But so is offering 17-18% interest on bonds. Just do it. I want to see what happens.

No, there's nothing more frictionless than a well-run, centralized system. Centralized system operators just edit numbers in their ledger. They can do billions of transactions per second. Bitcoin achieves decentralization at a cost of efficiency. Governments and banks are simply conservative, mired in tradition, and unmotivated to make their systems faster and better. Banks and governments could provide APIs for developers and do cross-border wire transfers in seconds if they actually set out to do it. As long as they can track your transactions perfectly, block transactions to "bad people" and "bad countries," and reverse them, they'll allow people to use a government digital cash equivalent.

Cost of a 51% attack: 
tl;dw: 1 million dollars is not enough.
In the long-term, bitcoin can't be stopped. People will hardfork, change the mining algorithm, and reset the blockchain to an earlier date. The more its attacked, the more it will adapt and the stronger it will become. 
With a 1 million dollar budget, you could only hope to hamper bitcoin, not kill it. The most cost-effective way of hampering it would be to aggressively short sell bitcoin with leverage as you attack it. Profit from the carnage and then attack again. Repeat this process over and over.
Examples of that would be, perish the thought, hacking Bitfinex wallets or kidnapping core devs or exchange owners after short selling bitcoin. Exchange rate plummets on the headlines and you make money. 
Use profits to lobby politicians to pass anti-bitcoin legislation to kill ETFs and exchanges while continuing to mount illegal attacks.
Set up fake drug markets and scam and expose users. Use profits to expand operations. DDOS and exit-scam on legitimate markets.
Donate bitcoin to a terrorist organization by withdrawing directly from a US exchange to the terrorists' bitcoin address (using a stolen account). The government will immediately take action and the exchange will freeze all funds as they investigate. Bitcoin plummets. Once again you profit from your leveraged short sales.
Donate a portion of all your bitcoin attack-profits to known terrorist wallet addresses to increase political backlash. Donate to the campaigns of all anti-bitcoin political candidates.
You need to actually make a business out of killing bitcoin. Short sell and attack. Disrupt every bitcoin conference. Bribe Chinese officials to make ominous statements regarding bitcoin. Death threats and assassination attempts on anyone who publicly advocates bitcoin. 
Declare total war on it. If your organization is successful at stealing, scamming, inciting carnage and short selling, the attacks should pay for itself until bitcoin is back in the single digits.
But bitcoin would survive it.

It's also wrong in the opposite direction.
If 1% of 22T actually moved into bitcoin in a short period of time, it wouldn't cause such a simply calculated increase in price. You wouldn't just divide 220B by the total number of bitcoins. Only a tiny fraction of bitcoin are up for sale at any given time. A fraction of the 220B would instantly wipe out the ask side of the order books and then the bitcoin supply would dry up because fewer people would want to sell. 
So the price wouldn't go up 78x. It would go up many many many times more. 
But when we go back to the initial premise, as you said, this is the 1% fallacy. Getting 1% of *all* the deposits in China to flood into your pet investment is actually absurdly difficult and is not going to happen.

Yes, central bankers are exceedingly good at this game. The situation could be on the edge of crisis and they can string it along for years and years.  Look at North Korea for an example of a strung-along inevitability. If you're betting on the Kim regime to collapse "soonish," you're probably right. But you would've lost your shirt betting on it to collapse if you bet on that in 2000. As Europe crashes even harder than the US, the dollar gets even stronger which gives the Fed even more ammo. Don't try to bet on collapse happening tomorrow. You'll lose your shirt. 
Also silver and bitcoin are cool and all, but maybe buy some ammunition and guns as well if you really think things will get so bad that you need to stock up on water. Otherwise someone will gladly relieve you of your silver. Bullets will appreciate in value just as fast as silver in that scenario.

@_date: 2015-03-25 18:15:59
If you use your $10-cost-basis bitcoin as cash, you still need to pay taxes on the capital gains. So, no, you're never totally protected from inflation. As the dollar drops in value, you need to pay more in taxes. But that goes for everything you have that increases in value against the dollar. 
Many people who trade physical gold and silver do not pay taxes on their capitals gains. Some people will do the same with bitcoin. That will shield them from inflation, but it's illegal.

For me, the 21 million hard limit was the most interesting, thought-provoking part of bitcoin. Any intro should mention it. Once you hear that there are only 21 million, many questions immediately come to mind. 
e.g. Who enforces the limit? When and how were the 21 million bitcoins distributed? What happens if you want to buy something for less than the cost of 1 bitcoin? Who determines the cost of one bitcoin?
That description is good, but it's missing all the magic.

The biggest part of bitcoin's allure is that there's a limited number of them, and if you get some, maybe you'll get rich.

Money Laundering Plan
1. Sell stolen bitcoins on Bitstamp.
2. Withdraw fiat to young, middle-class girlfriend's bank account.
3. Spend money on luxury purchases.
4. When asked how you got the money, have your girlfriend say ____________________. 
5. Profit. 
What was step 4? What genius excuse did this kingpin come up with for why his 26 year old girlfriend suddenly had tons of money. I'd really like to hear it.
"Tell them you mined bitcoin in 2010 and never sold any until now." 
EDIT: 
Just to entertain the stupidity of the excuse that she mined bitcoin early on, let's pretend we are the investigators.
1. Common sense says a) women generally wouldn't be mining new, fringe currencies in 2010 (sorry gals) and b) she would've sold at least a few before they went up 1000x in value, not suddenly started selling massive amounts in 2014. Any competent investigator would look to her close relatives and love interests to find the real (criminal) source of the money. 
2. Tech experts would've asked for proof of control of addresses that received mining block rewards from 2010, or at least proof of control of an exchange account or address with bitcoin from 2010-2012. She would not be able to provide them.
Conclusion: This man was a lazy, greedy, stupid fool who said "Whatever, I'm rich." instead of putting even the *slightest* effort into creating a plausible story to explain his wealth.

1. Protecting against a proof-of-work failure/inefficiency by opting to use Peercoin's POS or Bitshares' DPOS or or some other algorithm is fundamentally impossible with sidechains because all sidechains will be secured by bitcoin mining.
2. Other functions, such as anonymity, are not impossible on sidechains but suffer nonetheless. See [here](


For the side chain to work best, many people would have to keep funds in the side chain for a period of time, the shorter, and the worse the overall anonymity of all users will be."
I used to be a bitcoin purist, but once I had the free time available to actually research more of the altcoin developments in depth, I've come to realize that although bitcoin will be King, there are going to be niches that bitcoin can't or won't fill. Bitcoin is not "ahead" whatsoever in creating stable-value coins, private coins, decentralized storage, or any number of other functionalities. Bitcoin's core development team isn't even trying to approach these areas. And Dark Wallet or Bitpay/Coinbase solutions to privacy and stability (for example) are 3rd party hackjobs that come at a price.
Bottom line: Bitcoin is ahead in market cap and visibility. It's has the biggest network and it's probably the safest cryptocurrency investment you can make. It's the cryptocurrency that Joe Sixpack should buy and use. It doesn't mean that other projects are all distractions from the glory of bitcoin.

If the total market cap of bitcoin is $4000, it's going to affect the utility. You won't be able to do anything without destabilizing the market.  In the altcoin markets, we see coins going low and bouncing back, but if they go too low and spend too long of a time without a recovery, they die.

A couple of notes:
First. Tuur Demeester's historical, interdisciplinary approach is always a breath of fresh air. I like that he mentioned that Napoleon [paid his troops in precious metals]( as he began his war campaign.


Demeester also compares the 2.0 space to languages in the world and says that the internet is the freest place in the world to live.
Second, Although Voorhees says he's 99% in bitcoin, he admits that there are niches (e.g. privacy coins, stable coins, etc.) that will allow certain currencies or platforms to coexist with bitcoin. This is in stark contrast to and Daniel Krawisz's [vocal bitcoin supremacism]( Ver and Demeester also speculate that other currencies will coexist with bitcoin although bitcoin will be dominant. I believe this is the more realistic view.

Voorhees said that he personally had 99% in bitcoin. Due to the size of his bitcoin holdings compared to altcoin market caps, that's about as diversified as he can get. He didn't guess as to how big the altcoin space would get compared to bitcoin.
Of course, the altcoin pump and dumpers and vote brigaders deserve every bit of contempt that they get. But if an altcoin's technology is actually relevant to a situation, I don't mind them talking about it. The block size is something that we're dealing with at the moment. Some coins have already-functioning adaptive blocksizes. Other coins have solutions to volatility and fungibility concerns. I don't mind if people talk about that tech because it can either be incorporated into bitcoin later or put on a sidechain, right? Having those alts as laboratories is great as long as they don't completely dilute the market, which they're not.

The direction matters. Going from America to China isn't as easy because people in China aren't willing to pay a 5% premium to buy bitcoin because they don't have an ass-backwards banking system that makes it take 5-7 days to receive bitcoin. But going from China or Europe is free because of the premium.

Assuming that we have 5 million (real) users right now (real, as in owning more than just dust), we can still grow at a pretty furious pace before running out of people. 120% growth per year for five years and we're only ~258 million people. 
Two decades at a slower pace is feasible too. 20 years averaging at 22%. Would be nice, but I would think that the 5 year scenario is more likely. Just a huge global mania. People jumping in all at once. FOMO. That's just the way bitcoin moves.

This is definitely a dangerous time, but what also makes me optimistic is that bitcoin actually gets more useful as the price and volume go higher. I've used bitcoins to send thousands of dollars from China to America for free. That was only possible because both China and America have big bitcoin markets. I wasn't able to do that in 2010. At $1000, perhaps there will be sufficiently large bitcoin markets in many more countries, which will allow others to do the same thing. Once bitcoin picks up remittance volume, it may push the price up to $3000. Then, all the sudden there's enough volume for people to buy a million dollars worth of bitcoin over the course of a day or two without causing swings in the market. New floodgates open. It builds on itself.

There is a reason why the Philippines, with her tens of thousands of kilometers of tropical coastline, large mineral deposits, cheap labor, excellent English skills, and other resources isn't a fantastic business environment. If only we could figure out how bitcoin can actually help change the business environment in the Philippines rather than figuring out how to use bitcoin to more efficiently move money from Filipinos in Hong Kong to Filipinos in the Philippines. Or from Somalis in Minnesota to Somalis in Somalia. I would be much more impressed to see a platform where freelancers or firms in the Philippines or Somalia could do online work and get paid directly in bitcoin.

I didn't say they were superior. Privacy is a niche. There are a a lot of good things you can do with a ledger that's completely open and transparent like bitcoin's. In some instances, it may be preferable to an inscrutable ledger. (Note that Monero users can share viewkeys to voluntarily make transactions visible to 3rd parties, and bitcoin users may use coinjoin to obfuscate transactions as Dark Wallet is doing. But neither blockchain is perfect for both transparency and obfuscation.)
Pure proof of stake could simply be a blockchain that pro-environment people might prefer because it uses less electricity than proof of work in the same way that some people don't eat meat. Their choice to abstain from meat doesn't destroy the meat industry. In the same way, peercoin won't destroy proof-of-work and using peercoin may not have any visible effect on the environment whatsoever, but using it may simply be more compatible with their lifestyle and their politics.  Using the original peercoin blockchain would still grant one political capital in some circles.
That last point relates to dogecoin. Dogecoin is fundamentally not even trying to solve any problem. It's about having a fun community. When people say "We can recreate dogecoin and secure it with bitcoin's superior hashing power," it's missing the point. They sound like Borg from Star Trek. "We will add your biological and technological distinctiveness to our own. Your culture will adapt to service us. Dogecoiners will be allowed to continue your fun, meme-based community under the wing of bitcoin." I think many if not most dogecoiners will want to keep using their own blockchain just for fun. Even though it's "irrational" to do so. People are going to learn a lot about human behavior when they see that everyone doesn't instantly switch over to sidechained versions of coins.

It's not just the reserve currency. It's also the petrodollar. And the US has a lot of influence at the World Bank/IMF/etc. Add all these things together and the US is clearly the country that has the most influence over money in the world. Bitcoin helps takes control of the world's money out of the hands of the American government. It puts it out of every government's control. But as Chinese currency doesn't have a chance in hell of becoming the world's reserve currency any time soon, it would be better than the current situation. In addition, China has the savings/mining infrastructure to be very competitive players in bitcoin stockpiling/mining should it become an alternative to the US dollar. 
Why should China fear bitcoin. Bitcoin could allow for lots of money to leave the country without going through Chinese banks. China likes to control money within the country. Realistically, it's not difficult for rich Chinese people to get money out of the country without bitcoin, but bitcoin would make it easier. There's also public outcry. If enough  people get robbed and defrauded by bitcoin exchanges like GBL, the government may be forced to do something. 
I think the potential upside of bitcoin disrupting America's control of money outweighs the reduced ability of the Chinese government to control money in China. And if the latter posed a real problem, China could act quickly to shut down BTCChina and other exchanges if need be. They could do it within an hour if they wanted to. 
So they're going to wait and see how bitcoin develops and how much bitcoin helps them before doing anything.

I think so. Given enough volume, the market will naturally make remittance as close to free as you can get in both directions. 
If the price of bitcoin in say, the Philippines, is higher than average because demand is higher than supply, then bitcoin becomes extremely attractive for sending remittances to the Philippines. In fact, it becomes attractive to arbitrageurs who simply want to make money by buying low in say, Russia, and selling high in the Philippines. But all of this selling pressure will make the price drop in the Philippines. When the price drops, then arbitrageurs will buy in the opposite direction. They'll buy cheap bitcoins in the Philippines in order to sell them in countries where the price is higher, such as in the US. The spread between prices in various countries, given enough volume, will converge because of the action of the arbitrageurs. And once the price of bitcoin in pesos, rubles, pounds, and dollars are all equivalent, then anyone using those currencies can convert or send their money internationally for an almost-zero fee. All this requires is more volume. 
So I'm not afraid of the day traders, arbitrageurs, bears, bulls, or any kind of investor or speculator. They are meaningfully contributing to bitcoin's usefulness. The distinction between speculation and the "real" bitcoin economy is a false one.

The possibilities go way beyond extortion. Have you read about the possibility of autonomous, intelligent computer programs that use bitcoin as their currency? You could have AIs running around on the internet accumulating power and money to achieve their own ends. It's still tremendously sci-fi, but much closer now that there's a distributed currency that doesn't care if you're human or not. This isn't internet funny money. This is the beginning of big change. I don't think many realize how big that change will be if bitcoin actually takes hold.

If the LTC price is stable across all exchanges (due to easy arbitrage), but the BTC price is higher on MtGOX than other exchanges, then why not buy BTC where it is cheap (say, BTC-E), send it to MtGox, sell the BTC for USD, and then buy LTC. Then, send the LTC it to an exchange where withdrawing USD is easy, and then sell the LTC for USD on the other exchange. Then you withdraw. 
Let's say the price of LTC is $1 on all the exchanges, but the price of BTC is $5 on BTC-E and $10 on MtGox. Buy 2 shares of BTC on BTC-E for $10. Send to MtGox. Sell for 20 USD. Buy 20 LTC on MtGox. Send the 20 LTC back to BTC-E. Sell for 20 USD. Withdraw USD easily from BTC-E. You spent $10 on BTC-E and now you have $20 from selling LTC on BTC-E, which you can withdraw easily. 
And what is the consequence of this? There is additional selling pressure on BTC prices on MtGox until the price on Gox evens out with other exchanges.

BTC was the way that I paid for my hotel in the next country I went to before returning home to America. It made me realize how little these organizations care about you (whether it's your bank, Paypal, Western Union, Homeland Security, the IRS, NSA, FBI, etc.) and how much you can be empowered if you take your finances into your own hands with BTC. Before this incident, I thought about BTC mainly as an investment, but it became more to me after that. BTC is freedom. No organization can arbitrarily freeze, seize, debase, or garnish your money. It's just completely and utterly yours and you can send it to anyone anywhere. 
@_date: 2013-07-07 21:44:36
Because it's lacking in several ideal qualities. 
For example, Bitcoin gets a C in anonymity because it's pseudonymous and traceable, not anonymous. Think about what they want to do with zerocoin. You can build anonymity into the system, so that no one has to trust any third party to make his or her bitcoins truly anonymous. Modifying the bitcoin protocol to include zerocoin would require the agreement of miners and clients (network consensus) and it would be far easier for zerocoin developers to clone bitcoin or add that functionality to a smaller cryptocoin like namecoin.
So, if a currency appears that is able to outscore bitcoin, it should wrest some marketshare away from bitcoin and possibly outcompete it, despite bitcoin's wide acceptance and inertia.

Can you explain how exchanges profit from the spread? I assume you mean the bid-ask spread. Here's what I think you mean. Someone has a buy order for $100. The exchange executes half the buy order for $100 and then the price drops to $99. The exchange executes the other half of the buy order, still for $100, and pockets the $1 per bitcoin. OR do you mean that the exchange adds the markup to the price of bitcoins that you put up for sale. For example, if I want to sell my bitcoins for $100, the exchange automatically sells them for $101.

This is the fastest rising currency!
At the beginning, 1 dollar traded for 1300 bitcoins

Current bitcoins: 11 million
Total Number: 21 million
What special characteristics does bitcoin have?
Can't be frozen
Untraceable 
No need to pay taxes
Low transaction costs
Easily stored
Not easily stolen 
Why is bitcoin so valuable?
You can't copy it. 
High-tech production scheme. 
Upper limit of coins that will be created. 
What can bitcoin buy?
*lots of stuff*

1. Mining 
2. Buy bitcoin from miners. 
3. Sell stuff for bitcoin.
4. Go to an exchange.

As long as renting a plasma cutter from some shady guy costs less than 8-12k USD or whatever they expect to be in the ATM after watching people use it for a day, then it would be worth it. Besides that, it's too early to deploy these things. There aren't enough people in one place trying to get bitcoins, and it's awfully easy for the government to decide to seize your ATM because it's because used to launder money, and then you're down $5000 + whatever is in the machine until you finish in court and get your money back, if ever. Traditional ATMs have withdrawal limits. I could go to a BTC ATM in the morning when it's fully loaded with BTC and put 12k USD in it (which I earned illegally or didn't pay taxes on) and then send those BTC wherever. Do you think that's going to stand?

What kind of logic is this? Money and agricultural products serve completely different purposes. People want plentiful food. People don't want plentiful stores of value.
If I sink all my hard earned labor into a store of value (such as diamonds), I don't want people to be able to conjure up billions of them in an instant, because then my share will be devalued as the supply of them increases. 
If I can conjure up 100 potatoes in an instant, and you can conjure up 100 potatoes in an instant, there's no problem, because I'm not trying to use potatoes as a store of value. I just want to eat. You can eat. I can eat. Everyone can eat. Great.

As I see it, exchanges are bitcoins  problem. 
If you use an example and crunch the numbers purely in bitcoin, then bitcoin looks way cheaper than fiat for remittances. If you factor in the currency conversation, commission, and delays/risks of getting in and out of bitcoin, we're not really whooping fiat as much as we should be.. 
What would be great is some sort of P2P exchange mechanism where people around the world are trying to get in and out of various currencies and do free transactions for each other. I don't think Ripple is going to work. People won't trust it. FellowTraveler is working on a P2P exchange mechanism that incorporates BitMessage to discover others who want to do transactions and Namecoin to store/look-up transactions in a blockchain format. I'm not sure it'll work, but if it does, then bitcoin's biggest problem would be solved.
Another scenario is that companies like Bitpay open up in every country around the world and people can just use their bitcoins for the 1% fee (buying things directly or using prepaid debit cards) instead of getting in and out of bitcoin. 
But Bitpay isn't going to get you vegetables at the local wet market in Mexico. Maybe what we need in the end is thriving local, in-person bitcoin exchanges in every country. This is the option that would take the longest to happen.

Quiincy, you don't need to declare a profit as soon as you make a profit. If you sell one of your possessions tomorrow and make a profit, do you call the tax authorities immediately and say "I earned 10 dollars!" You file your taxes when they are due.
Even if I had called the IRS to immediately notify them of my $500 profit, or whatever it was, it wouldn't have made a difference, because it wasn't the IRS that froze my account, it was the bank. The bank froze my account on suspicion of a compromised account or fraud.

The issue here IMO is not the delay but the unresponsiveness. They should try to shoot off quick 30 second emails saying "The bank is slow. We're working on it." It can really stress you out when someone has your money and you just totally can't reach them. I had a situation where BTC-E had a hold on my account for 9 days and I sent them all the documents they wanted on day two but they weren't responding to my emails. By the end of it, I was pulling my hair out because I had planned in advance on withdrawing for business purposes. 
EDIT: And I say this as someone who worked at a major IT helpdesk and had to work my way through 200+ email queues in an hour. We kept that damn queue up to date. If a service went down and we got flooded with emails, then we just wrote quick e-mails saying "We're aware of this problem and we are working to resolve it ASAP." And simple emails like this can really make the customer feel that they are being looked after. Customer support from bitcoin companies just seems so slow and amateur to me. The idea of waiting 72 hours for a response is utterly ridiculous.

It has nothing to do with taxes. My taxes aren't due, and declarations were not yet due. I was not evading taxes or money laundering. None of the funds were criminal in origin. This is about accounts being frozen due to suspicion of fraud/money laundering/compromised accounts. When we sign up with banks, we agree that they are responsible for protecting our money, and so these sorts of problems are to be expected when our accounts show unusual activity. Personally, I expected this, and I informed my bank in advance of the upcoming changes in activity in my account. They completely ignored my communication and froze my account anyway. Now I am banking with another bank and we have no problems.

OK. The system may be a bit different in many European countries. I know that employees in these countries immediately pay taxes out of each paycheck. In America, employers withhold money for taxes and then money is returned to the employee if he doesn't owe it when taxes are due.

I doubt there will be money laundering charges against him. They'll probably just shut him down quietly if they don't like it. All it would take is for an official to contact him and say "Yeah, no." They'd look pretty stupid if a few weeks ago they say "Chinese people can buy and sell bitcoin at their own risk" and then throw some dude in jail a few weeks later for operating a site where people can buy and sell bitcoin when he's not using third parties or going anything they said. Basically, the question is whether it's legal or not to have a bitcoin exchange, right? If they don't want exchanges, then they'll stop him somehow. I'm glad that one exchange is going to help us find out whether the government meant "only 3rd parties aren't allowed" or whether they're saying that no one is allowed to run an exchange period. It's time for all this rumor and misinformation to be clarified.

The quote is pretty accurate, although it doesn't come from a named figure. The relevant portion, in Chinese:
The reporter called the Banking Regulatory Commission yesterday, and someone there told him there were *currently* no plans of promulgating any regulation geared towards bitcoin.
Experts recommend the government quickly decide whether bitcoin should be legal or not and step up its role in either case. If it's to be legal, then the government should improve its management over bitcoin and foster healthy development. If it's to be illegal, it should move as quickly as possible to shut down the bitcoin trade.

For me, it was a few days ago, when my back (CHASE) suspended access to my online banking and wiring because of "suspicious activity." I specifically warned them about changes that were going to occur in my use of the account.  I told them exactly what I was going to be doing, which was more than they deserved to know. All legal. They locked me out anyway after a few wire transfers of money from my American account to my Chinese bank account and acceptance of lots of cash deposits. 
They insisted that I physically go into a branch with two-forms of ID to restore access. I told them that I was not in America and could not do that. I told them that I needed access to my account. They asked me some security questions and then restored my access. Two hours later, they locked it again. They just stonewalled me and shuffled me around to different numbers for four hours and said there was nothing they could do until I physically walked into a branch.. nothing I could do to get my own money (the way I wanted to get it) when I was 10,000 miles away with a soon-to-expire work visa with no branches nearby. That's when I realized that my bank gives zero fucks about me. 
I took my bitcoins and paid for shit I needed to pay for. I'll take care of my own security, thanks. I'll also send money around internationally as I please, and without the $40 wire transfer fee. The only reason I don't ditch them altogether is because they were useful for accepting irreversible cash deposits in many locations around America. I hate banks. I hate paypal. Never again do I want to argue to get my own money from the people who I've entrusted it to. It's humiliating.  
Bitcoin's value goes beyond just being useful. If used correctly, it's going to restore our autonomy, privacy, and dignity. Cryptocurrency is the answer. Two years ago, I was curious. Now I'm believer. And I've told everyone I know about bitcoin. It's time to send these financial/government institutions back to the stone-age where they belong.

To be fair, there are certainly people around who try to pump up the price of bitcoin before they sell. And it might crash again. But I believe bitcoin will ultimately survive its crashes because of its useful properties. Someone buying/selling something on Silk Road won't care whether bitcoin is 1000 dollars or 5 dollars, so long as they get in and out quickly. And so long as there's demand for bitcoin, the price will creep up again, the speculators will get interested again, and I think we can repeat that over and over indefinitely giving it many chances for widespread adoption.

Well, having a US based bitcoin exchange seems particularly precarious at this point. Any business providing money transfer services needs licenses in 48 states if you are going to do business with people in those states. And there's basically no US-based exchange that actually has 48 licenses. IIRC, Campbx has one in Georgia but technically that's not good enough if someone from New York is going to send/receive bitcoins. Thus, it seems like a matter of time before there's serious litigation, frozen bank accounts, crashing bitcoin prices, etc. with these exchanges.

You forgot converting the Japanese yen to USD/RMB/RUB or whatever to buy on the other exchange. Also the waiting time for the banks to process your international wires and the possibility that the price tanks when you've got your money in bitcoins. The "having a Japanese bank account" requirement probably excludes a good 95%+ of bitcoiners. Then the "having enough money to make it worth it"  requirement excludes another portion. Of those who are left, some just aren't interested in taking that risk. Of those who are left, they *are* probably doing it, but there just aren't doing it enough to balance out people buying millions of dollars worth of BTC on mtgox.

Well, no one in China is allowed to use third-party payment processors to fund their exchanges, so the exchanges have developed workarounds. 
BTCChina now has a code you can buy, sort of like a voucher, which then gives you access to BTC on BTCChina. 
See here:
Huobi, CHbtc, and FXbtc and other exchanges accept RMB wire transfers directly. Accepting rmb wire transfers directly doesn't seem to violate anything the Chinese government has said right now, but it looks like the CEO of BTCChina is betting that it won't be allowed.
It's not clear how that bet will pan out in the long term, but the effects in the short term are devastating. The market doesn't seem too enthusiastic about the BTCChina voucher system and BTCChina is currently in SEVENTH place among all Chinese exchanges.

I would say the "techno" part is the democratic part. The currency is P2P and it requires the community to cooperate in running the nodes/mining to maintain the blockchain.

Yeah, with multi-sig transactions, you won't have to get a third party involved unless something goes wrong. Assuming the large majority of transactions are legit, then 1% fraud protection is avoided in addition to the fees associated with taking credit cards in the first place. When buying a big ticket item, like a nice computer or a plane ticket for $3000, the 3% that you could save would be too big to bother using anything but a digital currency. On the other side of the spectrum, off-blockchain transactions make micro-transactions a possibility where it was cost prohibitive to do it before. 
This reversibility of Paypal and credit cards and frozen balances are old tools of an outdated paradigm. The era of centralized payment processors deciding on "fair" outcomes of your transactions and the status of your accounts will be replaced by something better. The old ideas of trust, reputation, and escrow are going to combine with cryptography/mobile phones to make services like Paypal obsolete within a few years and put credit cards on the ropes given enough time.

Micropayments open up a multi-billion dollar market. Maybe hundreds of billions. Last time I checked, Visa and paypal fees make it infeasible to do a 10 cent transaction. But lots of people could find ways to sell things for 10 cents while making a good profit in percentage terms. So if you could buy an intelligent router that sells internet to passerbys in your shop for 10 cents a minute when you don't need that bandwidth, that router could pretty much pay for itself. With micropayments and near frictionless payments, we're going to see business models that would be unimaginable and certainly would *not* be possible with Paypal.

Well, I'm not saying it should be 100% commodity. I don't think that personal checks, money orders, wire transfers, traveler's checks, gift cards, or bank cards are commodities. Some of these are cash-like instruments and some of them are services that help move cash in different ways. Bitcoin might do the work of most of these things in the future. I'm also not saying that bitcoin can't or shouldn't be used as cash. If someone wants to buy a beer with it, that's fine. I think there are going to be plenty of middlemen/vendors willing to provide zero confirmation trades for people that want to buy small things the same way that plenty of people accept personal checks and that we'll be able to create cheap hardware wallets.

Anyone else tripped out by the fact that .05 bitcoins is 7.46 USD? One day, the dust in my old mtgox account from 2011 that I never bothered to collect is going to be worth something.

Use the automated system to create a new address and fund it now. Or take USD. Or risk creating a new address and taking those bitcoin. If you know for a fact that the buyer isn't going to tell on you, then you're OK.

I think we're lucky that things played out the way they did with the internet. We could've had a much more draconian, less-free framework had it not.

Too bad they can trace exactly where it went on the blockchain, and saw it went straight from the ATM transaction with your handprint to the Al Qaeda wallet they seized.

Or just call it a vending machine, as Lamassu does. It's a machine that sells bitcoins. Pretty simple.

Invite them. Girls brought other girls along so some of them were bitcoin newbies. Soon enough, we had them all set up with wallets and sending around some small amounts of bitcoin.

Imagine how much the airport would charge you to have your machine there. There's a reason why everything is expensive as hell at the airport. Rent is probably ridiculous.

Well, maybe not crazies. I imagine that the US government and banks might find it acceptable to throw millions down the hole to destroy cryptocurrencies, the same way it throws millions at the War on Drugs. But yeah, it's the idea that there are enough people trying to protect their own money to outweigh anyone else.

I'd use a two-factor auth, cloud-based hot wallet with a strong password for whatever you need for day to day transactions.
Then I'd have encrypted savings wallets on hidden drives distributed geographically across different jurisdictions. Mix the coins thoroughly before sending them to a savings wallet so that your savings wallets are not associated with your hot wallet or any exchange that has your info. 
A danger that few people talk about is when people know that you probably own some bitcoin and decide to torture you or kidnap someone you love to force you to retrieve your bitcoin. How would they know you have bitcoin? Well, maybe you were posting on back in 2013 when the average person could still own a full bitcoin.
How do you protect yourself against getting beaten with a $5 wrench until you give up all your bitcoin. Other than having armed guards and bullet proof cars, have dummy wallets with believable amounts of coins in it to give to someone after you take a beating and then cry really convincingly as you do it. In fact, you should probably let them beat you enough that the tears are real. Give it up too easy and they'll be suspicious.  
Last, keep a low profile and don't brag. Security through obscurity. 
EDIT: I just read your post again and realized you were asking about what novices could do. A hardware wallet and a strong password + 2FA on a cloud-based wallet is good enough for a novice. The cloud-based wallet should ideally *require* a strong password and 2FA so the novice will get his or her hand held during the signup process. The hardware wallet is uninfectable.

Imagine a bunch of AIs that each control their own botnets forming an alliance to take down some other group of AIs botnets. AIs could have wars on the internet against each other and anyone who tries to get rid of them. Humans could pick sides and get paid to do things in the real world for the AIs in bitcoin.

I also found his tone to be extremely abrasive and unprofessional. What I learned after working with some English people for a while is that many English men seem to take this tone when debating but they don't really mean any harm. Check out their Parliament sessions for some entertainment.

I really enjoy the thread on bitcointalk.org where some guy made up silly regal titles for people based on how many bitcoin they held. 100 bitcoin may not make you rich now, but it will make you a Viscount when BTC are worth 50,000 each in 6 years. :)

I read it many times, brother. 


Slovenia is clearly being monitored by the OECD to check on its compliance for the "gray list report"and is recognized as a tax haven or "financial center of interest." It certainly doesn't mean you can't send wire transfers to Slovenia.

Well, M3 is the money supply in its broadest sense, right? Why not use that. But for some odd, reason they stopped publishing M3, so I guess M2 will have to do.

Can you expand on that? Are you referring to the SEPA transactions or the cash deposits? I thought cash deposits in US bank accounts were non-reversible.

Just added 2-factor auth to that account I've been thinking about adding it to and lengthened/randomized my passwords. It may be no consolation to you, but you may help a lot of people with this post do things that they've been putting off.

These two questions are not as important as this guy thinks. Why? Because adoption by the average consumer is not necessary for bitcoin's success. The technical side of it and its properties are far more important. I've personally used bitcoin to send thousands of dollars internationally with close to 0% fees. 
Think about the fact that Western Union, which is merely one out of many ways to remit money, has a 10.24 billion dollar market capitalization. The value of all the existing bitcoins right now is less than 2 billion. The global remittance market is a 50 billion dollar market. So if bitcoin were to succeed in just the one area of international remittance, then that would be enough for bitcoin to be worth multiples of what its worth now. And in this example, consumers don't need to understand bitcoin or even buy bitcoin. The institutions that will use bitcoin to send remittances will simply take your money, and then people in other countries will get the money. And everyone's happy. The Winkelvoss ETF will let people buy into bitcoin without actually having to buy bitcoin. That means grandma can buy into bitcoin the same way that she buys into her mutual funds. Those two questions on how consumers can personally obtain bitcoins and what the consumer can personally use bitcoin for become irrelevant.
Can grandma use gold to buy icecream from the grocery store? No. But does gold need consumers to use it in their daily lives for it to be a successful tool? No.
In fact, I see far more potential for bitcoin as a sort of back-end thing (store of value, money transfer medium) than as a thing for regular people to use directly every day to buy beers (as cool as that is on a geek level). 
Think about something like Linux. Linux has very little marketshare in the consumer market for operating systems. It's running on what, 1% of your friends computers? So it's failed, right? Wrong. It's running on tons of commercial servers and other networking hardware and has a huge market. Just because your friends aren't using it on their HP desktops doesn't mean it not useful.

People in African countries with worthless currencies just keep their savings in American dollars or something else. It's not like it's bitcoin vs. [insert worthless currency here]. So using bitcoin as a store of value doesn't seem particularly necessary.
As far as remittances go, it would be easy enough for someone in America with a bank account or in a big city like San Francisco to get some bitcoins and send it, but it would be tricky receiving that money as some poor person without a bank account or a computer or a market to exchange those bitcoins.

I see. So he can essentially control how much of the global hash rate his company has at will? I can see why he wouldn't want ASICMiner's hash rate to be 40% of the network total. It would break people's faith in bitcoin, thus threatening his own wealth in the process. Must be nice to be so far ahead of the competition to the point where you can do that. 
@_date: 2013-07-14 10:43:45
I don't mean for it to sound that way. But people receiving remittances generally aren't very wealthy.
