Tax question: if I convert BTC -&gt; USD equivalent to the value of my initial USD -&gt; BTC transaction (in other words: leave any profits I've made in BTC), would I owe anything in taxes since I haven't 'realized' any profit?

If investing was as easy as extrapolating trends then hedge funds would all be profitable.

This is true, I know several people who had never owned stock, but got into bitcoin 'investing'.  They lost some money but are now aware that there are options beyond just letting your money sit in a bank account.

Talk to an accountant.  Capital gains calculations are generally not as easy as just subtracting what you paid from what you sold.  If you bought/sold through Coinbase I think this will be very easy for an accountant.  If you mined or have held for a long time I'm not really sure how it works.

HODL is only a good strategy if you have a legitimate reason to think prices are going up.  If you don't, then you're just gambling at 50/50 odds, which admittedly is better than Vegas, but not by much.  Alternatively, if you have any reason to think it's going down, sell, and rebuy when you find reason to believe it hit bottom.  
To be clear, memes don't count as reasons.

In fact, you can deduct the losses oftentimes.

Sure, but even being relatively confident that some form of blockchain tech will be around for the long haul doesn't really shed much light on how much very particular current implementations are really worth.  The eventual winner could be a coin that isn't even available yet.

I sold yesterday at 9, feels good waking up to 7k BTC.

People keep giving this argument but it doesn't really make sense: the utility of blockchain technology isn't really tied to the price of bitcoin.  No one knows what the final form blockchain related tech is going to take.

Theres a difference between knowing something is going to go down, and pointing out that an argument for it going up is wrong.

I'm not convinced it's finished dropping.  An all morning struggle to get near (still below) what I sold for doesn't instill confidence.

Investing isn't as easy as extrapolating the past.

This isn't encouraging, as you can always find points in bubbles where this would have been true.  Not saying it IS a bubble, but saying this alone isn't a very good reason to buy and hold right now.

Right, my point is, how many people here really have any legitimate reason outside of random reddit comments or memes to think they know the odds better than 50/50?
Even if you think theres a 1/10 of it going up 10x, that's extremely close to Vegas odds.  Would you put the same money into a game in Vegas as you are in BTC?  Maybe you would, but I bet a lot of people wouldn't.

I would argue that virtually no one can predict the short term moves better than 50/50, and that the overwhelming majority of people here have very little information other than 'it probably won't be worth zero'.  That doesn't help you push the odds very far from 50/50 for even very large swings either way.  
With that information, how should you bet (buy)?  Knowing it won't be worth zero still doesn't mean holding is a very good strategy.

You can get in at any time, if you really think it's going to go up, then buy.
