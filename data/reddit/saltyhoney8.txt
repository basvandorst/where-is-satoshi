You have good points, but who many sellers are actually miners? The BTC price depends only on public interest if people stop caring about btc miners wont have any influence on the price

If read this for me it sounds as you think 4% annual return seems as worst case but it isn't? Math can't tell you what tomorrow is, and BTC could fail totally. I don't think it will happen - I don't hope it will happen. I really pray for crypto being the future. I wish that you will retire asap, just keep in mind everything could happen and don't go all in with this.

I‘d post the full story if people care. Maybe there are some more victims that can resonate

You should probably check out Celsius Network if you didn't already maybe this could help improving your profits

You didn't understand my point, sure halvening is real but miners do not determine the price

But for me it looks like the cost to bitcoin mining increases to a point where it’s just not worth it anymore.

Very detailed thoughts ����
@_date: 2019-09-01 13:03:08
Why do you think that?
@_date: 2019-09-01 13:04:48
Yes is the best answer when there is no yes no question
@_date: 2019-09-01 14:22:34
I don’t think that this is comparable at all. Gold is still considered a luxury good who could you make a wedding ring from Bitcoin?

And will the demand remain when there are a lot of crypto alternatives that are faster and don’t consume that much energy with mining

What do you mean?

So you would call Ether and Litecoin a Shitcoin that will never keep up with BTC? A Fall of BTC seems impossible to you?
