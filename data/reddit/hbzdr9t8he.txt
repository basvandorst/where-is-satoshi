history has many valuable lessons, especially money history
the lack of interest in learning them is more unfortunate than fortunate

i doubt there's an actual real college that people go to for their reputation for knowledge like back in the day in Greece
now it's all a big joke about booze and networking

They're used to getting silent blood-debt money through inflation.  Take that out and they're more apparently just some stooges stealing peoples money.

people semi know what this one means "drive-by infections from web pages (by means of images, Javascript, Java, Active X)"
because they know what images are and some of the names so they think "hey i know what that is" so they think they know what the hell it means, while not having the slightest fucking clue.
the thing should read:
"bad software"
adding all the "i know that name" candy to it DOES NOTHING
AND "drive-by" as opposed to the number 4 getting married to the color green on a very octagonish day?
THAT MAKES MORE SENSE

"distributed ledger" pretty much sums up BTC and no need to get into CC or ECC
@_date: 2014-01-23 00:45:58
right, i could shout that into my closet, so nobody would hear, so it wouldn't be solicitation.
The basic fact is that any time words are involved, there are appeals being made.   Even a baby is making appeals (sales) when it tries to speak.
@_date: 2014-01-22 22:20:39
actually it's the question that was sold in public and the answer was sold in public, so both the asker and the bot are soliciting
actually, you can boil any public message down to solicitation for attention because you have a name and you're selling an idea or viewpoint, even if it's a simple question
"wtf is bitcoin?"  is solicitation because it asserts that "bitcoin" is real and that you're interested in what it is, 2 sales you are supposed to buy as a reader, 3 if you count the name
so the following
UberL33tPerson: "WTF is Bitcoin?"
consists of three pitches to any readers:
* my name is UberL33tPerson
* There is such a thing as "Bitcoin"
* I am interested in what "Bitcoin" is.
to try to say you can't solicit is pure hypocrisy and a lot of times the fallacy moderators use to crush dissent.
nowhere does it say "loose interpretation of solicitation"  it just fucking says "solicitation"
@_date: 2014-01-22 21:59:37
what kind of "proof" do you propose
remember now, it isn't a 100% surveillance state just yet, but if you try hard you can make it one!

there have been cases (and new cases now) where browsers behave badly and get "tricked" into running executable code instead of displaying the contents as an image file
people bring this up all the time but I really don't see any real danger as it exploits specific browsers long ago.  sure a new browser or browser patch can break a browser allowing the same kind of execution, but lets just try to stay rooted in a practical mindset and blow this one off as not a **real** attack vector like "Installing unverified software from unknown sources"
people like having the maximum amount of shit to worry about, and worry about all the shit equally at all times, i guess i'm just different and like to conserve my energy a bit through awareness
@_date: 2014-01-22 23:01:53
there's things called paper and pencil and the sky and ponies and rocketships too but that doesn't fucking answer my question.
"shakedown, audit, etc"  it's all used by men with guns
just say guns next time
You bring up ancillary devices like shakedowns as if force isn't a necessary part of it.

so you didn't ask for hbzdr9t8he specifically and you can't prove i'm not a bot so am i selling something to you (soliciting)?
yes, but not because i'm a bot or not!
actually it's the question that was sold in public and the answer was sold in public, so both the asker and the bot are soliciting
You can boil any public message down to solicitation for attention because you have a name and you're selling an idea or viewpoint, even if it's a simple question

if you place the answer on a sheet of paper and put that paper on the ground then when someone who wants to know that particular answer happens to be walking by the paper gets near the paper you trip his ass, sending his face planting into the sheet of paper, sending an indirect answer.  your action of tripping his ass *is* the indirect answer.  or is it just the method of delivery?

just pulling up the file table on an infected USB stick won't infect jack shit
you have to run/install a script or executable that resides on it
that bullet point doesn't help anyone by not pointing that out.
just saying guns r bad mmmkay isn't enough, you have to truly educate them about firearm safety
