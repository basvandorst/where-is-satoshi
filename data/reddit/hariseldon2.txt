Purely theoretical piece (or should I say pitch), with no bearing in reality.

You could just sell your bitcoin and then buy again when they drop

I see the end result I am a law abiding citizen with a bank account and I am unable to open an account with you 
@_date: 2014-02-05 19:48:15
Well said we'll just increase the decimals

I did a research on Greek bitcoin forums about my problem and I read that most people got verified just by a scan of their passport presumably before you changed the requirements and started asking for a bank account statement 
@_date: 2014-01-07 19:39:26
Why don't just give that change to the cashier I know it may be inconvenient for them but it's money to

I bought a few shares to this morning (GMT +2) at 0.0032 I wonder when it will be a nice price to sell out

Having your wallet hacked dusky p doesn't mean the bitcoins get lost it just means they change hands

You miss the point Cyprus as well as a number of other troubled European countries **can't** mint their own coins!

I'm already using Bitstamp over a month now
@_date: 2014-02-08 05:03:12
The way the article is phrased it implies that there is at least one address, if not more, that holds 21 million bitcoin, which is not possible
@_date: 2014-02-10 05:24:22
I think this not a valid question, today's economy enables stone people to just become trilionaires we just never heard of them
@_date: 2014-02-16 14:23:40
Like money and gold bitcoin is valuable as both a means of exchange and a store of value, basically it is all of this items hold value because people want to exchange them for things they value, if no one wanted to exchange your money for something they would hold no value
@_date: 2014-01-09 05:42:16
They should start accepting doge to, looks more becoming 
@_date: 2014-01-27 15:27:03
It has been said by EU officials that all bank customers are actually investors in the bank stop they should expect to be asked to bail them in
@_date: 2014-02-01 22:50:12
Well most wallets have automatic translation to whatever currency you desire so I don't see what's the problem
@_date: 2014-02-07 19:11:47
This article states that 98 addresses hold between 10,000 to 21 million bitcoin funny since there's only around 12 mln bitcoin looks like crappy article to me
@_date: 2014-02-13 11:47:33
It's working today with no problems
@_date: 2014-01-09 12:56:58
If you have special requirements hu you should take the time to write 2 lines, I don't know what it was that you didn't like in my document so I had no way of amending it to your liking.
My account got verified finally today and I haven't submitted anything else from what they have originally rejected so I don't know what changed.
Before about 2 hours I received an email from lemon way stating that the reason they have rejected my bank statement is that they need a document that displays the IBAN and BIC for the bank account. Of course the IBAN was displayed in the document but maybe the fact that out doesn't say IBAN before it and just states bank account number confused them. As for the BIC this is public information for every bank and it is easy to acquire.
Then after one hour I received an email that said that my account was verified, maybe they noticed the big number starting with GR and figured that must be the IBAN.  
And all this after more than one month since I applied, I think that if I haven't made since noise I would still be nowhere
I think you guys at bitcoin central are good meaning and all but perhaps you may want to change your business partner lemon way.
@_date: 2014-01-09 05:32:02
Well it does show my IBAN and BIC prominently, only it gets rejected, no one explained to me the reason, besides sending me an unrelated generic stock refusal email 
@_date: 2014-01-08 18:43:12
I understand that you personally have good will on my case and I would like to thank you for it, but you must understand that as an adult with 8 different bank accounts in 5 banks in 2 countries I feel extremely frustrated at being unable to get my account verified with your service through no fault of my own
@_date: 2014-03-07 05:27:14
Yeah but the true Messiah would never admit to being the Messiah! It's been said by the Monty Pythons!

Yes but with the mobile app you get alerts when funds are transferred to your paper wallet address
@_date: 2014-01-30 05:37:05
but doesnt it hurt when you know you could've made $0.75 if you could just hang on a little more?
@_date: 2014-02-01 18:53:21
What a stupid article! So what's to stop the community from saying each bitcoin is 1000mBTC and then your salary will be like 6000mBTC and a car will cost 100,000mBTC and a loaf of bread 0,75mBTC and so on
@_date: 2014-02-12 11:03:07
i dont use blockchain as an online wallet , i just use it to watch my paper wallet adress (scan watch adress only)
@_date: 2014-01-07 05:34:21
I don't know so I'm just asking. Is the rupee that stable to begin with?
@_date: 2016-06-30 16:24:32
No I ended up using the mobile app for purchases
@_date: 2017-01-01 15:24:22
Authy sends you an sms to authenticate your account on the first time you use the device. From then on you have to input a password to decrypt your account.
@_date: 2017-01-13 05:36:35
Could it be just a trick by the exchange to attract traders? The Bitcoin that got traded might even have stayed within the house
@_date: 2017-01-13 06:26:28
Maybe it's a bad business strategy or they hope to attract vultures who will try to prey on such instances
@_date: 2016-11-10 05:38:06
I'm sure that as soon as Trump instigates the 40% China tariff the man will pay out he's just waiting for the economy to get going.

That's a law here for more than a year
@_date: 2016-09-14 20:55:02
A quick internet search listed a number of ways your could do just that 
@_date: 2019-01-29 19:44:16
Just buy some crypto and sell at some other exchange. It's a good time to buy in anyway. I wouldn't take any chances with kraken. They held my funds hostage for more than a year once.
@_date: 2016-09-14 17:32:28
Why? If they can steal your usb stick they can steal your paper wallet.
@_date: 2016-09-14 16:14:44
why not just use a pdf of your paper wallet on a usual usb stick?

My Greek bank charges me 4€ for bank transfer to a different bank and 0.20€ for cashing a check of another bank.
@_date: 2016-05-21 19:03:26
I had one in Germany. But if you run a business and the only way to get paid is through banks you can't operate without a bank account in the country. 
Especially when the amount anyone is allowed to send abroad is 1000€ a month. 
Capital controls are pretty much in place. 420€ a week max withdrawal. 1000€ a month max money you can send abroad. Credit cards blocked except for domestic purchases. All transactions above 500 have to go through a bank. And you can't open more than one bank account in any bank.
@_date: 2016-05-21 13:47:02
Unless I emigrate it's not that I have too much choice. Especially with capital controls on.
@_date: 2016-07-12 19:33:14

I carried that much money around at least once a month with no problem and even carried multiples of that sometimes, and I don't live in the US.
@_date: 2013-11-29 14:59:32
How exactly will this thing work? In confused, how would one enter the amount to be paid?
@_date: 2013-12-22 18:12:25
You can also try virwox but they sell high and have relatively big fees
@_date: 2013-12-25 17:10:30
Try virwox u c can use PayPal or credit
@_date: 2013-12-09 13:10:49
Funny thing is I don't know what a good price to get into is anymore

There are already many trillionaires in the world, in places like Zimbabwe and such
@_date: 2013-12-26 19:21:32
Excuse me if I'm wrong but aren't the exchanges just trade fascilitators that people willing to part with their money in contact people willing to part with their bitcoin?
That means that if the price is set at 1200 then there are people willing to buy bitcoin at that price so someone should be able to cash out at this price, now if you want to sell a ton of btc maybe you'll run out of buyers and maybe that'll bring the price down, but you should be able to do it if slowly, and the exchange won't even Hick up because it will be using its money pay you and it will even make a pretty commission or of the transaction
The guy is mixing exchanges with banks imho
@_date: 2013-11-21 13:05:58
I applied for verification on both just to be on the safe side
@_date: 2013-11-27 10:46:28
would be nice but that would require some capital

Bit stamp send me a rejection notice yesterday because they thought my ID scan was low quality, they also didn't like my utility bill because it was in Greek, guess what I live in Greece, I resubmitted a PDF scan of my passport today and a statement from my bank in English, 
I still haven't heard from bitcoin central from 4 days
@_date: 2013-12-26 19:34:36
You scan the address or enter it manually to the wallet you want to transfer the funds from and you ask it to send btc to the paper wallet, the private key never sees the web, and if you want to send funds from the paper wallet you then scan the private key with a wallet like blockchain mobile app only the key has seen the web so it's not that safe anymore, it's not that hard, practice with a small amount first just to gain confidence
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:00:01
I don't think there would be room for unit bias, few can afford not to accept fewer than one million dollars and everyone dreams of getting one million dollars in his bank account

Right

With only 21 million of bitcoin ever destined to reach circulation, it stands to reason that if it ever becomes a popular means of exchange most people won't ever hold a whole 1 unit of bitcoin, in the same sense that most people won't ever hold a million $

If retailers are able to immediately concert their bitcoin that must mean there are people Woking to buy them so there would still be a demand for it
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:04:53
From the moment I decided to get myself some bitcoins till my account gets verified on the purchasing sites the price has more than doubled I find myself wondering if it's worth it anymore

this is a big issue and the exchanges should fix it, i mean i live in Greece whis is (still) in the 1st world supossedly and outside main cities more vlillages and even some towns dont have street names and numbers, the mail is sent to someone using his name and village name

Sane can happen now with cash, I guess if bitcoin ever becomes that mainstream people will start to diversify the way they hold their button stash, they would have done pusher money on their mobile, some on a more secure osier l paper easier or such, and some in a desktop or online wallet
@_date: 2013-12-10 09:14:22
the little orphan child wouldnt be able to get verified on any of the major exchanges and would have to buy BTC from virwox or such with shit high commision fees
