1) Price rose to $1,100 on new Chinese buyers and concurrent media hype cycle. 
2) Chinese buyers were effectively banned by their govt, causing some panic and fewer new buyers to enter the market. Some of these Chinese buyers sold based on fears of govt bans. This caused the price to top out and decline slightly, ending the bubble psychology. 
3) MtGox melted down, decreasing confidence in the whole bitcoin ecosystem
4) built in inflation of bitcoin coupled with fewer new buyers and the profit-taking of previous investors has led to a fairly consistent decline over the last several months. 
5) adoption, venture capital, and infrastructure continue to develop at a very encouraging rate
6) The next hype cycle seems likely to come within the next 6-18 months, causing an even larger gain than the last bubble 
7) Hold! (also spend and replace your existing bitcoins)

So to sell something, say my car, on counterparty, I would:
1) Type and sign a bill of sale (or just a straight deed?)
2) Scan the document into a small file and "attach" it to a certain amount of previously purchased XCP 
3) trade this particular XCP token for whatever price I could get, presumably paid in bitcoins. 
4a) whoever bought the car would now have the contract/deed/bill of sale stored in their own private XCP address OR
4b) the sale is recorded in the XCP transaction and ownership is determined by the traceable transaction history following the uploading of the initial file.

The halving COMBINED with the huge increase in the ease of buying bitcoin.

If MtxGox was claiming they had bitcoins they that actually didn't (fractional reserve) that would artificially depress the price, not raise it. And I also don't believe the "trading bot caused a bubble" explanation. 
The MtGox price was higher during that period of time because of the lag time required to withdraw and suspicions about solvency, leading to a "Gox Premium".

Would like to see some kind of increased social networking integration. It would be much easier for lenders to determine credit worthiness and motivating for borrowers to repay if their Facebook or Twitter account was linked. At least give the option. This would make it more like a true p2p global lending platform. Also allow lenders to lend to anyone, even those who choose to reveal less of their identity. But make statistics on payback of equivalent type loans available so lenders know their odds of repayment.

There have been a few times (can't remember who exactly) that I tried to find someone's wiki page and there wasn't one, or an existing one wasn't as informative as I wanted. Shouldn't Wikipedia be focused on being accurate and informative? Exclusivity doesn't seem like a selling point, is there an SEO reason maybe?

I agree with all of this, but if all else stays equal then the good news on the consumer front should (in theory) motivate speculators to buy. Obviously miners selling, early investor profit-taking and bubble psychology all play a part in the downward pressure.

This completely misses the point. The amount of Bitcoin is known in advance and factored into the price. The number of dollars printed is constantly adjust by a group of central planners on an ad-hoc basis. 
That's 2 completely different things. It helps to think of money in terms of it being a commodity. 
And yes, there are many other problems with central banking such as people in power can have bad incentives or be selfish, but I'm not even addressing those right now.

If there were 12 million bitcoins in existence at the time, and demand for 12.5 million at that price, but MtGox sold 600,0000 bitcoins to people that didn't exist, thus alleviating some excess demand, that depresses the price. 
The price of bitcoins was higher (and then lower) on MtGox because of the delays in withdrawing fiat and uncertaintity about the solvency of the MtGox exchange itself. No one could use arbitrage to lower the MtGox price because there would've been a months long delay before they got their fiat, thus probably eliminating any profits.

I'd recommend denominating the loans in a fiat currency with a decently profitable interest rate. Then it isn't really investing your bitcoins as much as just using bitcoin and these websites to make loans to needy 3rd world entrepreneurs. These bitcoin loan sites have a ton of potential to help 3rd world entrepreneurs get loans based on Facebook and online reputation systems but if the price of bitcoin goes on a tear (in either direction) it would be bad.

This is why the price keeps following the boom/bust growth cycle. As more people learn and appreciate the potential of bitcoin the number of "neckbeard techie" buyers and holders continues to increase. Speculators keep driving the price wild, but it has continued to go up over long time frames because of the continuous process of expanding knowledge about its potential with more and more investors. Yes, there are things that could go wrong and cause a legitimate, lasting price crash, but otherwise things still look very bullish to the most knowledgeable investors.

People buying stuff from overstock and tigerdirect etc definitely causes some short term downward pressure (medium and long term merchant adoption is obviously good for price) but the number one factor for the current relative low price is the selling pressure from miners. 
When more hobbyists/enthusiasts were mining they were more likely to just hold the bitcoins. Professional/large scale miners seem to be more likely to sell immediately to recoup their large investment. So even though the block reward has decreased from a couple of years ago, sell pressure from miners has probably remained fairly steady.

I would think this scenario of a ton of people buying bitcoin on credit at roughly the same time would cause the price to skyrocket over the short term (obviously) and then crash back to a level still somewhat above where it was when the huge buy initially started. This would be because the price rise would only necessitate selling part of those bitcoins bought on credit to both pay off the debt and pocket a decent profit. Then the total pool of bitcoin holders has been enlarged by those people who would most likely hold on to at least a decent percentage of their original big buy.

It seems likely to me that the Bitcoin price will recover significantly in the not-too-distant future. Yes, the majority of the Chinese speculators that helped drive it to $1,100 are probably not coming back anytime soon, but there are many other factors that I think will cause another large price boom within the next 6-18 months:
1) New Wall Street ETFs coming online and opening new speculators to Bitcoin
2) Halving of the block reward in early 2016
3) More exchanges opening and growing new markets for Bitcoin (Mexico, Argentina, Asia etc...)
Another interesting way to look at it is, What would things looked like if/when Bitcoin price eventually "tops out"? I would say we are nowhere near market saturation of the following groups:
- speculative investors who are willing to risk a small portion of their savings on a potential big gainer/new technology 
- diversifying investors who are similarly looking to put a small portion of their portfolio in different asset classes (precious metals, real estate, cryptocurrency)
- unbanked/underbanked in the 3rd world looking for access to global markets
On the other hand I'd guess we are somewhat near the saturation point of 2 markets that have helped Bitcoin grow greatly in its first 5 years:
- privacy seekers who use cryptocurrency to purchase goods online without giving away their identity 
- libertarians who use and invest in Bitcoin because it means fewer war dollars for the federal reserve to give to the govt to use to make bombs. 
Also there is always the possibility (however small) of a new competitor overtaking Bitcoin, or of flaws in the code or some new invention that displaces cryptocurrency entirely. 
TL;dr High risk, potential high reward; I'm overall very bullish on a 2-4 year timeframe.

I'm not sure what they cost right now but maybe a Trezor loaded with 30 or 50 bucks worth of bitcoin? If they keep it a few years and it goes up crazy again (which a lot of people definitely believe it will) then it's awesome. If it crashes to zero then it's a funny story. Some will sell, some will hold, someone will probably lose it and regardless you'll have a story to talk about for years.

Yes but in completely different ways. Bitcoin isn't really competing with PayPal right now, it's usage as a payment mechanism isn't due to its convienice factor like paypals is. Bitcoins usage as a payment mechanism is for a much smaller potential market of privacy users and libertarians. But Bitcoin has a much larger potential market in other areas, such as international remittances, store of value(gold 2.0) and banking the unbanked.

Strawman? I don't see where Gates said it has to be a single company. There are already multiple MPesa-like companies in different areas and competing head to head. Bitcoin's value proposition is that it's international and unrestricted. Competing on fees with the local companies will actually be fairly tough for Bitcoin to do globally in many disparate markets.

Of course the corollary to this is that it doesn't take much to move the price majorly in the other direction, either. For those of us who are still long term bullish this is a buying opportunity of an asset with a very large potential upside.

Well done. Said another way, if there is a 30% chance of approval then there is an expected rise from its non-etf price of 800 of .3 x $1700 ($2500-800), or $510. 510+ 800 = $1310.

While I'm obviously impressed by your condescending use of "champ" we'll have to agree to disagree. I like Molyneux, he is an excellent speaker and would also do a great job but Kokesh is less wordy and more straightforward. When trying to convince a relatively uninformed audience it's better to have a confident, no-nonsense war vet over a more intellectual thinker/wordsmith. 90% of communication is non-verbal, just look at Trump.

I only had time to research a couple of those but they weren't ETFs. One was a managed mutual fund that invests in both bitcoin and bitcoin companies. The other is a very restricted offering from Barry Silbert's group that has a large premium over the price of bitcoin at least partially because of the restrictions on how and when it can be bought and sold.

Apples to oranges..
Bitcoin isn't competing with PayPal. It's digital gold, a store of value. A source of investment diversification. 
It's a neat milestone but it makes more sense to track Bitcoin's market cap relative to market cap of precious metals, etfs, bonds, stocks generally and other investments and savings vehicles.

"Trust your gut" is ultimately sound investing advice IMO because your "gut" subconsciously incorporates a lot of information together for you. It's not the same as being emotional though, you need to be relaxed and centered to properly listen to your "gut".

Use a Blockchain.info account to import the private keys and then immediately send the Bitcoin to a new, unused, safe paper wallet. But I haven't done this in a while so caveat emptor. Also there is a difference between "sweep" "import" and maybe one other option that I'm not remembering. Maybe someone more knowledgeable can correct me. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 00:44:15
Does anyone know of a reasonably accurate guesstimate of the actual number of valid bitcoins, i.e. not "lost"? Because that makes the market cap smaller, and should make people more bullish because there's still more room for growth. So if 1/3 of bitcoins are lost, market cap is really more like $10 billion.

ETF would/will go live quickly, within a few days. The skyrocketing after it goes live would be much greater than the few days between announcement and opening, and a drop beneath that level would be unlikely in the future as volume would be supported by new etf buyers. The unlikely possibility of a short term loss is fairly inconsequential compared to the several years run of it having made people a crap ton of money. This is an embarrassment for the sec no matter how people try to spin it. No 13x return in 4 years for you! Sorry! We've got to protect you!

I disagree with "buying Bitcoin is nothing more than a short of world currencies". Bitcoin competes in the investment space alongside gold, stocks and real estate. It's use as a currency is a nice dream for us libertarians but reality now is that its digital gold. World currencies going up or down could have an effect on Bitcoin but it would be akin to the effect on other investments, not as if people would run to Bitcoin to buy coffees because of dollar dropping. Even in venezuala it's still used as a store of a value primarily.

So you think non-Chinese who have fiat on Chinese exchanges are buying BTC so they can transfer it out? Interesting theory...
@_date: 2017-09-01 03:01:04
Yes, basically all previous price rises were cut down by a negative event within Bitcoin. So, pretty much impossible to predict when something might happen. Best strategy IMO is to keep looking for market saturation, this will be the "endpoint" when the big runups are over and Bitcoin becomes more dependent on traditional market/economic trends like gold is now: up in times of uncertainty and down in stock market run ups. I don't think we're anywhere near that point yet.

Estonia could still just declare cryptocurrency legal tender in their country and not tax it. There's still plenty of room for an innovation hub to develop in the cryptocurrency world.

Saying 'from 3000 to 6000' is overstating it but your general gist is correct. Current numbers on coin market cap dot com confirm this as BTC is down but almost all alts are up considerably.

This might be a long shot but will this platform allow for local security creation and/or trade?

True, although as a percentage of their respective market caps I'd think Bitcoin would have significantly higher pure trading even ignoring regular Bitcoin transactions just because of its volatility and speculation. The percentage should go even higher with a Bitcoin ETF of course.

The "personal responsibility" remark is a straw man, non-sequitor that I won't address.

It's good and healthy to recognize the shortcomings of your role models. I've been and remain a Buffett fan, but this is one area where his words conflict IMO.

From what I've seen the rally is being led by Asia, especially Japan. Japanese govt has ruled that Bitcoin is a currency so won't be double taxed like in America. 
I also think having ETF instruments in Germany and Sweden has to be helping a decent amount. Since those both came online a year or so ago the price has pretty much only gone up.  Also I believe people are probably still bullish on an eventual American ETF, although the huge premium on GBTC would seem to indicate the opposite.

I disagree with "damaging." Honest money like Bitcoin avoids the negative incentives of overspending and over borrowing that the government keeps encouraging with their increasing debasement of govt money(ie dollars). Less rat race, better accounting for what really matters in life. With honest money like Bitcoin, quality of life goes up, even if the lame and misleading GDP statistics go down. Also, with honest money there would be less waste and a refocusing of economic efforts on truly important tasks that people valued, and less effort put into wasteful crap that people currently throw their money at out of habit and poor incentives to not save.

He advised people "Don't follow Bitcoin, it's a mirage" and he followed that with saying something like there are other ways to do what Bitcoin does so he wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't even around in 10 years. No, he didn't issue a press release but short of that it's a pretty strong "negative" position on something he clearly doesn't understand. Also, he gave his advice when Bitcoin was much much cheaper than it is today, so people who listened lost out on huge gains. 
Following your logic, if he had said "stay away from Amazon stock, it's a mirage" back in 2000 or whenever you wouldn't consider that an impingement on his "don't get involved with investments you don't understand" dictum? And Amazon is a company. At least he knows something about companies. Cryptocurrencies are considerably farther afield than even tech stocks for Mr. Buffett. Just because he advised the negative rather than the positive, he is still taking a position on something he doesn't understand.  
@_date: 2017-06-23 15:38:02
I'm personally a Buffett fan and think his investing principles and strategies are broadly applicable across many domains. But this is the one area where I've noticed he oversteps his own advice and weighs in on subject matter where he isn't really knowledgeable. I would seriously love to hear him interviewed by or debate a knowledgeable cryptocurrency investor. I think people tried to make this happen with him and Erik Voorhees a couple years ago. Would be very interesting, although I'm guessing Buffett wouldn't really have a ton to say other than stay away.

Litecoin has about zero chance of ever supplanting Bitcoin. The only alt worth looking into at this point if you want a cryptocurrency hedge is ethereum. Bitcoin has such a massive lead over litecoin and they are so similar that any positive changes to litecoin will be added to Bitcoin long before litecoin has gotten even remotely close to Bitcoin's market share.

Excellent point. I would think this will eventually positively impact the Bitcoin price as the crypto Alts get exposed for the non-value adding knock-offs that 99(%) of them are. (The one potential exception IMO being ethereum). Newbies who bought some Bitcoin and some of another alt (litecoin, monero, etc) sell their alts and buy Bitcoin when the respective alt bubbles burst. Based on posts in this sub this pattern has already been repeating itself for years. In other words, the more experienced the cryptocurrency investor, the more heavily their crypto portfolio leans towards Bitcoin and away from alts, on average. 
@_date: 2017-06-02 17:57:11

I'm a Buffett fan but I definitely do fault him for violating his own dictum of not getting involved with investments you don't understand. Bitcoin (and tech in general) is not Buffett's expertise so he shouldn't be making pronouncements on it as an investment either positively or negatively.  At least with tech companies they are still companies, which he is used to evaluating in other industries. And he still chooses not to invest in them. He has even less domain knowledge of cryptocurrency/Blockchain. He certainly can (and should) choose not to invest in crypto out of ignorance but that also means he shouldn't take the negative position and basically advocate shorting them.

The hedge fund index that performed the best was currencies, thanks at least in part to Bitcoin. That's good news and will be noticed by hedge fund managers. They may not buy tomorrow at the all time high but if Bitcoin has a dip I'm guessing a few will be there to buy it back up. Bullish.
