I'm of the opinion that for the majority of non-technical folks who are buying very small fractions of Bitcoin, leaving it on the exchange is probably safer than them trying to figure out how to safely secure it.
I realize that is not a popular sentiment on this sub but in order for Bitcoin (or any cryptocurrency) to become adopted by the masses, it needs to be a lot easier to buy and manage.
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:33:43

Just because you will be paying less taxes (because you have children) doesn't mean that it is the same for everyone, certainly is not the case for a large section of the middle class.
The New York Times did a very good [analysis]( of the bill that was passed by the Senate.  It basically shows that families with children and higher earners will benefit the most while people who pay high state and local taxes will see tax increases.

Right, they said that customers would at some point receive BCH equivalent to what they had on the exchange in BTC as of Aug 1. They never said that on Dec 20th they would open up the exchange to active trading.
You seem pretty hell bent on defending them
Edit: Even CNBC is [reporting]( on this.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:25:29
My advice is to buy with money you can sacrifice doing wasteful things anyway.  I'm not talking about a much needed vacation or new running shoes.  But that $12 you spent on lunch?  Brown bag it and buy yourself some Bitcoin.  It adds up.  Meanwhile, you better be maxing out your 401k or IRA.

@_date: 2017-12-12 20:55:34
You are correct, I misread that chart.
However, if you look at the analysis of the bill, even if you are ok with you getting a tax cut at the expense of other middle class taxpayers, most of your cuts are set to expire in a few years while the cuts to the wealthy will not expire.
And, may I ask, do you live in a HCOL area or a LCOL area?  Because that makes a huge difference in determining where one falls in the middle class spectrum.

As someone who has been using Coinbase since 2013 and have generally been happy with them, even I think the timing and the manner in which they listed bcash is suspect.
And, I tried to send my bch to my private wallet and 2 hours later still no confirmations.  Not sure what that is about but was pretty sure one of their (bcash crowd) crows is that transactions are cleared quickly.

I know for you and a lot of us, maybe it doesn't matter.  But for the majority of the people out there, they need the protection that banks offer.  This is why it is so difficult.  Hate on banks all you want but they are required by regulation to provide these protections.

What you are advocating is *gambling*. Hopefully  you understand the difference in risk between a fairly safe investment (real estate) and a speculative investment (Bitcoin).
And to answer your first question, no.  Bitcoin is a wildly speculative investment and you should **never** borrow money for this type of investment.
But I suspect you'll have to learn the hard way, for you sound to me like a gambler.

@_date: 2013-08-20 14:45:18
Just so you know, this is not the norm.  I don't know about the UK, but what happened in the US is that banking institutions teamed with Wall Street to put people in houses that they really couldn't afford.  And then pumped up the market (bubble) so that these same people could borrow against the "equity" that they had.  When the housing market came back down to Earth, many people were left holding property worth less than they owed.  But again, this isn't the norm and it doesn't mean that all real estate is high risk.  
@_date: 2013-06-28 01:56:46
