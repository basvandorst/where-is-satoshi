Interesting. I used to lurk here quite a bit out of pure BitCoin interest. The community was very helpful and respectful.  
Had not been here for a while, bit a twitter post made me check out this thread....
Sorry to see that even here trolls, mistrust and greed are getting/trying to get the upper hand :(

How is a wallet file useful to a 'hacker' . Don't you need the private keys or at least the wallet password in order to spend the coins?  Similarly, if you have an HD wallet,  do you really still need to back it up when you have the 'seed words'?

Had the same problem.  Repair fixed it for me.  I just moved some coin from MB classic to HD as it was supposed to be 'better' . Now I'm thinking about moving it back again or to a different wallet all together.  Pisses me off. Paying transaction fees due to crappy software. . .

Pardon my ignorance, but isn't the file useless without the private key? Or is there a chance they can brute force it ?

What client do you suggest as alternative?

Do you have a job that pays in bitcoin? To me that seems like the biggest condition for this to work?

Question: if I'm running a full node, does that mean that I can process my own transactions? I.e. it would get cleared faster ?

Sweet! What brand/model is that? Road legal?

works like a charm, but you'll need an Interac account.

Is this similar to 'change addresses' ? So Address A has a balance of 1 BTC, I sent 0.25 BTC from that address. The remaining 0.75 BTC no longer resides on address A, but a new 'change address' has been created for the remaining 0.75 BTC

If you have Interac: quickbt.com
Used it several times

It's still Monday  - right? Question about BitCoinWisdom.com:
Can someone explain all those abbrevations ? EMA/MA/MACD etcetera?
Also where can I find more info on the site? There is an 'orders' section but no info on it? Not looking to order anything there, just curious. It's a great looking site, but seems vague.....

See the news message on bitcointalk main page - they were hacked.
They advise not to logon.

lol - money is always a motivator :) Thanks! Also thanks to the other replies - that does make sense.
@_date: 2013-11-08 15:20:52
Ah :) Yes, I'm guessing that would take a while with the 0.2 btc limit ;)

I looked at that as well - but it appears that I need to have a blockchain account and use a blockchain wallet?
Or do I just setup a blockchain account/wallet, and then use my local wallet address to get *that* balance (and basically leave the blockchain wallet unused)

I have to agree with the fees thing you mentioned at CAvirtex. I almost signed up, but then took a closer look at the fees and especially the 'dormant account' fee... Decided to keep looking for a bit....

Also depends on where you are located. (Country) Easiest way I found in Canada is Quickbt.com
