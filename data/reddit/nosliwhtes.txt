How in the hell is buying a knife even kind of illegal? They sell them on Amazon. What kind of knives would be illegal?

How would an FFL turn this money into fiat without it getting them into some kinds of legal trouble? I am not a lawyer so I have no idea how that works. 
What would be the best way to make it into fiat again for them?

I guess from a business model under the federal guidelines, it's smart on their end.
However, it's not very libertarian of them. And bitcoin sort of represents free trade to me.

I'd love to have PIN confirmations for sending transactions.
@_date: 2015-06-06 17:44:25
That's very strange. "You may only spend money the way we want you to even if it's totally legal in your state."
@_date: 2015-05-05 19:06:51
Hey there
@_date: 2015-05-16 18:46:40
Yes, that is correct. 
@_date: 2015-05-16 15:06:47
Exactly. I exclusively pay for things with credit cards (and bitcoin) because they pay me to use them. The trick is to not spend money you do not have. Pretend your credit card is a debit card and assume the money is already out of your bank as soon as you swipe. 
@_date: 2015-01-23 22:33:21
Yep, I knew about bitcoin for years, I just didn't know it had gotten more user friendly. No reason people should not be using this! 
@_date: 2015-01-27 19:13:33
@_date: 2015-01-24 21:48:48
Cool, thanks!
@_date: 2015-01-25 00:26:20
Awesome! Circle is just really user-friendly. I also like that I can withdraw to USD so efficiently. 
@_date: 2015-08-30 20:36:59
Does snapcard give you instant access to bitcoin immediately after purchase like circle? That'd be awesome. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:33:43
0.00044 BTC here. Feels like $4 bucks, man. Very happy though. 
@_date: 2015-07-30 18:43:06
Well, everyone wants to make exchanging currencies worth their time. So they try to get a little profit.
Circle.com has a pretty easy process for acquiring bitcoins with credit card or bank account. They have a very minimal markup.
@_date: 2015-07-29 22:28:28
Regular 30% for me. Feels real good, man. 
@_date: 2015-04-03 00:51:52
I've been on the waiting list for 2 months. I'd like to give it a try but can't seem to get access. 
@_date: 2015-04-25 15:47:34
Probably a bit late but ya know. 
@_date: 2015-03-03 06:47:31
I tried texting them. No responses, man. 
@_date: 2015-03-14 18:14:51
This analogy has always been cool to me. 
I told my dad about this but his response was, "Yeah but gold is real." 
@_date: 2015-03-11 00:06:29
Woo!

@_date: 2015-03-07 19:29:47
Tips are great.
@_date: 2015-03-27 13:32:54
Psychological, I guess. 
@_date: 2015-03-03 17:44:37
Well, I sent multiple texts so far and had some friends do the same last night. Nothing. 
@_date: 2015-03-07 20:07:19
How would they exchange it for fiat after they accept it? Unless they just like to have bitcoin, routing it through the banks via Bitpay or Coinbase won't turn out well for them right? 
@_date: 2015-03-21 19:10:40
Yikes, $5 extra per transaction?
@_date: 2015-03-07 19:49:29
@_date: 2015-03-17 03:31:13
It's an extension, y'all. 
@_date: 2015-03-17 03:19:06
have $0.05 on me, BitttBurger! @_date: 2015-02-17 22:15:39
Thanks, man!
@_date: 2015-02-05 20:34:28
50 bits 
@_date: 2015-02-01 22:48:10
Thanks, friend!
@_date: 2015-02-05 20:35:24
10 bits
@_date: 2015-02-01 22:38:25
muh tip 
@_date: 2015-03-15 02:35:20
@_date: 2015-02-24 03:17:14
Thanks! I don't know why I didn't see it before.
@_date: 2015-02-05 07:19:44
@_date: 2015-02-05 20:27:18
Howdy, tip partner.
@_date: 2015-02-03 21:25:21
That would be awesome. Only thing is, I have credit cards that give me cash back. It's like getting paid to pay for things I would have paid for anyway. I'm conflicted on what to do if bitcoin became and option. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 20:33:47
52 bits. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 02:09:52
Looks good. Why not use bitpay instead of linking your addresses? 
@_date: 2015-02-05 20:34:55
Woo! 50 bits. 
@_date: 2015-02-21 16:19:30
Circle does not allow an exact withdrawal of your money into your bank. You can get pretty close, but you have to leave a satoshi or something in there, man. 
I like Circle a lot but that made me sad. Might check out a wallet wallet.
