*Happy Festivus*
**The Tradition of Festivus** *(Festivus Rules)*
**The Festivus Pole**: The Costanzas' tradition begins with an aluminum pole, which Frank praises for its "very high strength-to-weight ratio." During Festivus, the unadorned Festivus Pole is displayed. The pole was chosen apparently in opposition to the commercialization of highly decorated Christmas trees, because it is "very low-maintenance," and also because the holiday's patron, Frank Costanza, "find[s] tinsel distracting." 
**Festivus dinner**: In "The Strike," a celebratory dinner is shown on the evening of Festivus prior to the Feats of Strength. The on-air meal appeared to be meat loaf or spaghetti in a red sauce. In the episode, no alcohol was served, but George Costanza's boss, Mr. Kruger, drank from a flask. 
**The Airing of Grievances**: At the beginning of the Festivus dinner, each participant tells friends and family of all the instances where they disappointed him or her that year. As quoted from Frank Costanza: "I've got a lot of problems with you people, and now you're going to hear about it!" 
**The Feats of Strength**: Traditionally, the Feats of Strength take place after the Airing of Grievances. The head of the family tests his or her strength against one participant of the head's choosing. Festivus is not considered over until the head of the family has been pinned to the ground. A participant is allowed to decline to attempt to pin the head of the family only if they have something better to do instead. While it may be fun idea, the traditional Feats of Strength could be damaging to people, not to mention furniture and household appliances.

Its my second Corvette, I had an 87-L98 that car actually fits me better but is not as much fun as the LT-1 300hp and 170mph for a 25 year old car its a lot of fun. They are bottoming out price wise and you can pick them up with lots of miles for about $3500 and up. Condition is everything don't let the miles fool ya. LT-1 has the Optispark issue and overheating can be a problem unless you are scrupulous about keeping your rad clean but other than that they stop go and turn pretty good. I can't imagine how good the new ones are. With the prices today thats all I can do is imagine.
