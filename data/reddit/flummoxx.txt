I honestly get more enjoyment watching Johoe's Mempool graph than watching the price ticker.  It helps having a couple of dinosaurs in the 20 sat/byte strata that need to be unearthed.

Nope.  It's because people that want to get their txs processed faster, pay higher fees.

I got 4 transactions floating in the 80 sat/b range myself dating back to the 17th.  Don't worry. If current trends continue, they should start processing txs in our range tomorrow.  Merry Christmas.

A person doesn't need to know how to build an ipad to invest in and profit from Apple stock.

Show me an intentionally not-for-profit bitcoin miner.

Just like panhandlers in real life, make me [laugh] ( and I might give you a dollar.

Sounds like they are saying that they know that $900 is more than $100 (or where ever they bought in at) more than they are saying they can code better than Satoshi.  
Just tell them you sold yours too and move on.

How we'll does a 9mm suppressor work?  I was watching youtube videos, and it seems like you still get a pretty good report.  I was thinking of getting maybe a .22 mil suppressor since it seems to make a pistol "Hollywood" silent.

Wow, if that's all it takes for Bitcoin to succeed, then it's time to invest in treasury bonds.

Greedy people are the only ones buying bitcoin and are the only reason it's value is where it is.  I'm afraid Jesus isn't buying bitcoins on Bitstamp to give to the poor.  That's just my opinion though...he could be.

That wouldn't make a very interesting self-post title though.

Well, I didn't mean to imply you were "Charlie Sheen" level winner at life.  That'd take a lot of hookers and blow.  :)

Speculating? I bought mine in June and haven't been motivated to do anything with it other than let it sit.  
Next time I see a bitcoin poster on ESPN College Gameday, i'll be sure to donate.
When I can buy an FN SCAR MK17 for 1 bitcoin, i'll be sure to buy it in BTC.

It's probably doing something to "change **his** world".

Bitcoin is as bitcoin does.  It has no morals.  And I'm so, so, so far from the top that you can sleep easy.  
Don't buy more than you can afford to lose and you'll be alright, no matter how greedy the rest of us are.
