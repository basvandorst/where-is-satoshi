Because I missed the boat even though I was in on BTC early, and every time I read a story like yours I'm filled with pure despair.
I've heard all the reasons I would have sold early and how if everyone did the same Bitcoin would have never risen the way that it has, but the truth is that I will never forgive myself for missing out on the only decent chance I ever had to be a millionaire, or even just financially independent. 
But besides all that, I'm a giant piece of shit who has made many, many bad decisions. The only thing I look forward to anymore is the day I fucking die. 
Anyway, congrats on the find and good luck!

I agree. Not like it matters, but since we're discussing it already...

That's a good idea, I didn't realize that their gift cards are digital. 
I also wanted to see if I could get the $20 off $100, but that doesn't apply on gift cards, so I might have to give up on the $20.

Haha, what a fucking crook

The idea that I missed the train on this generation's gold rush is so fucking depressing. 
@_date: 2014-07-05 05:58:50
That's actually a great point. Bitcoin could mean huge changes (for the better) in society if everything goes the way we hope it will. I don't even have any money invested in Bitcoin, I'm just riding the train in spirit.

I think you're right. My friend has been bitching for the past year about buying in at 16k and how much he lost. In the past few days his story has changed to "maybe I'll actually make some money...."

Oh great, he comes my weekly depression wave from having missed the bitcoin/tesla boat.

I thought he was saying "quick-ass service".
Even better,  quick ass-service.

How can I check the DB file? I had a few coins when everything went down, but couldn't find any proof of my balance when I received the bankruptcy notification.

Where can I read about Bitstamp tipping off the IRS?

The guy says he's never spent $50,000 on anything, and the fucking accountant doesn't blink twice when he gets a weird wire request to a vendor no one has ever heard of. 
Newsflash, it was an inside job.

I'm not a fucking lawyer, but I don't see how that could possibly be right.
If I give you $100 to purchase an asset, after which that asset becomes worth $1000, you're saying you can pull whatever reason you want out of your ass to refund me the $100 and keep the $900? 
I'm sorry, that just doesn't make sense.

And yet Eobot holds no responsibility? Are we saying that the money never entered their accounts and they never purchased Bitcoin with it?
Like they give a fuck if Paypal takes the money back, they already made 5x back. Why would they fight it at all?
Edit: I put 20x instead of 5x

What a coincidence, I made this same idea last night, except instead of a "Philip Hue" light (I don't know what that is) I used arduino and a multi color LED strip. It lights up or flashes behind my desk based on the percentage of change so I know if I need to act.

There's no way in fucking hell they would allow that, just like it shouldn't be allowed for them to do the reverse.
Oh well, I guess that's the nature of the Wild Wild West Bitcoin. In the end I'm starting to think that maybe a little regulation isn't so bad after all.
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:15:05
Eobot never stated that the money was in hold with Paypal, they simply said that they were holding it until the chargeback period ended. How do I know the money never entered their accounts?
Even if Paypal reversed the transaction Eobot would still be in great shape due to the exponential rise in Bitcoin value.
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:06:32
The money left my account, and was held for over 30 days, at which point I could not use said fiat to purchase bitcoin somewhere else. I don't see it any different if Eobot was robbed or their building burned down, that's not my fault, I feel like I made an investment and should be compensated on the return.
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:25:27
So if I purchase an asset with someone else's money, once that asset rises in value I can simply refund the investor's money plus interest and keep the profit?
Thanks for taking the time to respond here, I'm not trying to be an asshole, just trying to understand.

You fucking idiots!

They are saying that they never bought the coins because they never got the money. At best they stole our ROI, at worst it's a fucking ponzi scheme because they were taking payments and not buying the coins. How the fuck were they supposed to pay out withdrawals after 45 days if they NEVER BOUGHT THE FUCKING COINS. It's a complete cluster fuck and I bet they walked away with hundreds of thousands, if not millions.
