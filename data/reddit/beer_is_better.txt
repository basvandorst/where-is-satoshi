Find satoshi, i'm sure he has a few bitcoin laying around. 
On a serious note, I'm sure there are some people IRL who have bitcoins in japan. Just post a listing to the bitcoin forums, asking to buy some bitcoin in real life, meet at a internet cafe with your laptop (hopefully you're in a metropolitan area such as tokyo where theres a bigger chance of meeting some one)

You can deposit via ACH and they will wire your USD however it isn't automatic and there is a minimum amount required for receiving a wire. I'm just complaining because it isn't as easy (ie automated) as it could be. I doubt that mtgox can easily get ACH clearance to do credits because it requires acceptance in the ACH program which is run by the federal reserve and mtgox is probably breaking some american laws regarding securities and exchanges. I could be wrong on that though, IANAL.

I think you're missing some basic features and the mechanism behind bitcoin transfers. a QR code could only hold the public and private key and once you sent the public and private key you wouldn't be able to use them again rendering the card useless. See [bitbills](

How much are you interested in investing? Just a round figure, if its larger than $500 I would recommend mtgox, otherwise otc is easiest. I can help you out if you like or there are plenty of other people who can. If you happen to be in a larger city, theres probably somebody that can meet face to face to transact with you.

Simple tutorial for getting money out of crumbling country: 
Step one: find some one to buy VEB for bitcoin (this will likely be the hardest) 
Step two: Either send bitcoins to a trusted individual or hide encrypted wallet very well on flash drive, laptop or cd. 
  
Step three: Flee country and redeem bitcoins outside crumbling country.
I just realized how good a function bitcoin serves in this regard. Best of luck to your friend.

Two well discussed scenarios:
 
The US/EU/JPN governments rules bitcoin an illegal/illegitimate security, alot of people decide to dump their coins rather than be on the wrong side of the law. 
 
 A security vulnerability in sha256 or it's bitcoin implementation allows for trivial creation of bitcoins and a malicious hacker starts dumping bitcoins on the market for a quick buck. 
The market crashes and you're left with the biggest sweetest gaming rig around.

It doesn't mean people wouldn't try to get rid of their bitcoins quickly as soon as a ruling was announced, leading to a crash. 


Just because it hasn't been broken doesn't mean it won't be.
These are just two of many scenarios. However, I personally don't see bitcoin being in any imminent danger though. Still, I don't feel comfortable with telling people to spending 50k on hardware only for mining. If they want to speculate on BTC, spend 50k on bitcoins, It's easier and you'll probably end up with more bitcoins than mining for years would ever get you. See the spreadsheet above.

Gold and Silver can lose their value, [see the 20 year chart of gold]( In the late 70's gold was at ~800 by 2001 it was at ~200 now its at ~1500, so the idea that gold doesn't lose value is just silly just like house prices never go down. Bitcoins can lose their value, they just haven't yet, but like gold, bitcoin is tided to inflationary and instability fears, both of which are very high at the moment so i doubt their prices will be going down in the near future. I wouldn't put all your money in bitcoin but maybe a 1000 euros, another 1000 in some bonds or some blue chip stocks, another 1000 in some physical assets like gold or silver. I'm not a licensed professional of any sort but if i had 3000 to invest thats what I would do.

Its the biggest, most liquid market, more momentum than anything else. If paypal allowed e-currency purchases then I'm sure mtgox would use them as it is easier for anyone in the US. If we had something like SEPA in the US i'm sure mtgox would use it.

You wouldn't be able to see such a list, you can probably find out from blockexplorer which address has the most bitcoins but that isn't going to be accurate as some transactions are 'dummy' transactions and everyone will end up with many addresses.

The forumlas would have to change but the math still adds up and the idea of a 'negative' interest rate is funky. However negative interest rates are not [unheard]( of and can actually spur investment as people will see that they will have to pay back less than they got (making even more money!)
For example the exchange rate goes from 15USD/BTC to 30 USD/BTC in a year. If I was gonna pay back the same amount in USD as i borrowed, I would need a -50% interest rate since bitcoin doubled. So a 1000 BTC loan would be paid back as 500BTC, but since the lender wants to 'make' some money I could be pay back 550 BTC (a -45% interest rate), in USD that would work out to a 10% rate in USD since 50BTC *30BTC/USD would be 1500 USD and 1500 USD divided by the original loan amount of 15000 USD would be 10%.

I'm sure that once you get your LR account setup and you get a good third party exchanger of LR to dollar it is dandy but I think it would REALLY be to mtgox's benefit to get ACH working.

I think you're giving most people too much credit. First figuring out bitcoin, learning what there is to learn about it is not easy to most people. I've tried to explain it to most however once I get into the slightly unconventional aspects of it people just give me a wide eyed look. As bitcoin stands, the technical side of it is too much for most people to trust without 'institutions' or other authority figures to rely on. 
That isnt to say that bitcoin won't continue its rise however it does mean it will be limited until people can just swipe a smartphone at gas station to use it as payment.

Bitcoin prices are independent of difficulty, difficulty is determined by the amount of processing capacity, as more capacity comes online then comes higher difficulty. Theres honestly no reason for BTC to be at 7 USD or whatever ever it happens to be. If some guy who started early wanted to cash out and drive the market down to 1USD/BTC he could easily do it and you're basically out of luck and the cost of operating the rig would be more than you would get in any reasonable amount of time. 
I wish I had spent the 2grand that paid for my rig on just buying bit coins when it was at 1USD/BTC, I would have way more money now than I got from my bit coin rig.

To a certain extent mining is like a lottery but think about it this way: Lets say I play a casino game where I win 49% of the time, on a handful of rounds I may end up winning 80% of the time however if i play a million hands I will end up winning 49% +/- .001% of the time. Winning a block of 50 coins works like that and there are calculators available that will tell you what your average earnings will be given a certain difficulty and the capability of your hardware. So don't get hung up over the mining part of bitcoin. 
The point of bitcoin is not to mine coins and 'get rich'. Mining is designed to serve two purposes. The first being the way to prevent double spending of bitcoins and the second to distribute bitcoins to as many people as possible. A currency that exists only in a few hands is not useful because you need people of different skills and specialties to be able to exchange the currency for goods and services. In the end you need people to be willing to work for bitcoin. If only two people in the entire world had bitcoins or any other currency, it would be worthless as only those two could exchange goods and services.

No goes around saying the us mint is responsible for money laundering because they create a currency (paper money) that is effectively untraceable. Bitcoin isn't completely anonymous but its pretty good, If the IRS/DEA/whatever government agency wants to track you down, they'll just grab your laptop and look at your wallet, emails, forums posts, etc.
 
Any item can have a variety of uses, and to focus on just one is just stupid. Honestly, as it stands bitcoin is a horrible way to launder money, Its easier and more direct just to do it the old fashioned way, with a sketchy bar, banana stand or any other business that already deals with large amounts of cash.

I have both an xbox360 and ps3 and am skilled with a soldering iron but I'm sure alot of the bitcoin community is as well and is technically skilled. So I'm sure those in the BC community that would want one probably already have done it themselves.
 
I feel your stress about not being able to sell directly for bitcoin, out of the last four items that I sold online/ebay/craigslist I was only about to sell one for bitcoin. But two of them I had to give at a low cost simply because they're not items most people need or want. Just think about the BC market as small so theres gonna be a small chance that some one wants one of your items.

There are failure scenarios where gold becomes entirely worthless, they're just too far out there for anyone to take seriously.

If your concern is utter collapse of the euro, then bitcoin isn't a bad idea, getting your money out of the country would be easy. Way easier to smuggle a flash drive on your way out than a duffle bag of cash (if you can even get cash or anyone will take those notes if the euro collapses). 
However the utter collapse of the euro is VERY unlikely and then you'll have bigger worries than getting cash out of the atm.

Try posting on the forums, I did and it helped and also check out if there are any issues with dwolla transfers, I know for liberty reserve theres a daily limit mtgox is allowed to transfer out and if you don't get your request in before the limit it can be a little while before you get your money.

Nothing has 'intrinsic' value or rather value is an utterly relative concept. What value does gold have? what value does the dollar/euro/yen/etc have? Their value to me lies in that the supply is limited and it is accepted as payment for other things (ie shared delusion of value). 
Lets think about the native americans with the first arrival of europeans, they valued beads the europeans brought because of their perception that they were rare and valuable (due to technological differences). I'm sure if they had known that those beads get churned out at a stupid rate they wouldn't have been so easily conned. 
Lets analogize their experience to this situation. Is bitcoin a scam where by everyone thinks bitcoins are difficult to create yet reality satoshi is secretly laughing behind the scenes since he knows a flaw in the implementation of bitcoin where by he could create as many on the fly as he wanted? You tell me... via PM ;-)

Definitely not solo mining, you'll go for months if not years at the current difficulty and the increase in difficulty we're at before you'd get a block of 50 bitcoins.
You can try different miners and just see which one will give you the best hash rate but don't expect much more than 30Mhash/s. 
The bitcoin to dollar exchange isn't the easiest if you dont want to use paypal. You can get another paypal like account such as dwolla or liberty reserve or you could just find some people in real life who will take your bitcoins for dollars. I would but I happen to be in the southeast US and are as well, try to find other bitcoiners.

@_date: 2011-05-16 18:22:26
Each card can get 650MH or so, maybe 700, so we're talking 2800MH total being generous. Assume it only gets built by the difficulty increase, the calculator guesses about 4 days for a block @ 50btc  is 350 every four days. So if you're spending 4000 on the rig, we're talking a 46 days and assuming no more increases in difficulty which is unlikely, so a better guess maybe 2 or 3 months.

A pool is used to distribute fractions of bitcoins when you don't have a fast enough computer to ever stand a chance to earn an entire block of 50 BTCs.

If you're looking for a serious response here goes, but I don't have the time or energy to get into every nonsensical point this guy makes. The biggest mistake is he is making a false analogy to gold which, while many bitcoin supporters like, is not at all gold in so many ways its scary. 
Bitcoin is NOT like gold in alot of ways: 
Divisibility, remember bitcoin can go to eight decimal places unlike gold which is not easily divided, 
Portability, theres no reason why there couldn't be a credit card, NFD, RFID, or whatever tech you think of that could transfer bitcoins. there is even a guy that has developed QR codes (2d barcodes) that can be printed on paper and used disposably to transfer bitcoin, much like checks.
Statements like "Believing in the gold standard is disbelieving in capitalism" simply are just FUD. It sounds like "MP3's are communism" or "Linux is communism" or whatever crap you hear people saying.
However I would agree that "In order to create currency, you have to do a bunch of pointless busywork". It holds true for dollars or bitcoins, How many peoples jobs really matter? Well, like beauty, 'value' is in the eye of the beholder. For example I don't like mussels, If every mussel fisherman decided to stop, I could care less, does that mean mussels are without value? nope, but as far as I'm concerned they are. 
"Value" is derived from some broad summation of peoples wants and people want a currency that is difficult (if not impossible) to trace and regulate outside of some basic rules (eg strict limitations on supply). 
Bitcoin isn't going anywhere anytime soon. It won't (i hope) take over as anyones dominant currency but it will serve an important niche. 
@_date: 2011-05-09 05:36:27
The total network hash rates will probably drop quite a bit but fees will make up for the difference, I think the best analogy for what the bitcoin network will be post "bitrush" is a distributed payment processor (in a similar way as visa, mastercard, NACHA, etc is for fiat).
