About 6 billions are estimated to have been mined.

Haha. This wasn't intended to be a forecast. It's just an interesting way to look at its scarcity.

I like where your heads at.

Just an observation that I found interesting and chose to share.

In the US gold market value is listed in ounces. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 02:17:38
I'll allow it. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 00:37:19
That's where my head went too. The S&amp;P 500 has delivered and average interest payout of more than double that for 30 years. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 00:31:14
I've screen shot your answer. In 21 years you'll be famous for this. Haha

There's roughly 6 billion ounces of gold mined on earth. I divided that by the number of minable BTC. I did incorrectly state the total number of BTC at 29 million though. My bad. It's 21 mil. So the number is even higher. 
= 285 oz of gold/BTC 
Gold price is around 1300
