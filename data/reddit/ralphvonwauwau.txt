Drug dealers prefer cash.... or so I have been told.

But blaming that on cryptos is like blaming people being fat on soda, or people being deadbeats on alcohol; If they didn't have this tool, they'd find one.
The folks touting Prohibition in the USA sold everyone on the idea if we got rid of "demon rum" then deadbeat husbands would become upstanding citizens, and take their loving families for carriage rides after church... turns out it wasn't the rum.
..or the soda, or the cryptocurrencies.

umm... no. April 7, 2013 -  71% drop in a single night, now THAT was a crash. 
"in most cases, bitcoin has bounced back from the crashes in months or even weeks—suggesting nervous bitcoin buyers will be okay if they are holding for the long run. On the other hand, the crashes of late 2013 and early 2014 are a cautionary tale—recall it took years for those who first bought bitcoin at $1,000 to see their investment recover."

The trading software I am familiar with has 1, 5 and 10m buttons. You can enter larger amounts but even 1bn is going to need approvals due to credit limits in place that typically run in the couple100m range

Pretty much all I get from the post office is spam. This year I got maybe a dozen actual messages, and the rest was all advertisement and political disinformation.

I've tried using logic on those folks, "If you want to buy drugs, do you think the dealer will take bitcoin or cash? ... So isn't your position that cash is what needs to be outlawed? "
The response is for them to act like I am an idiot, and if I try to get them to explain their position, this time so it isn't stupid, they just play pigeon chess.

The four horsemen of the Infocalypse -  child porn, money laundering, terrorism and drugs. Anyone who wants privacy MUST be guilty of one of those.

True, no camera, typing on the touch screen is annoying (I have some old school text adventures on my PW) but it can be done...  I am hoping that there is a lightweight proof of concept that is already out there (PW will run [arm.ipk]( files) This is a toy edgecase, but it would be cool.

Considering who is making which, that is less likely than  being hit by a meteor, twice, while riding a unicorn.
