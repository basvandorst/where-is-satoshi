This kind of reminds me of the steam key sites like G2A. They only need to pretend to be legitimate enough to get people to take out their wallets. As long as people aren't getting phished, they don't care about the morality of what they're getting.

NEVER EVER.  Thanks for your intelligent contribution.

a thousand bitcoiners just had a great idea for where to make their next investment

The majority of trading on the stock market is done by bots.  A huge chunk of the entire country's economic activity happens there, no one person has enough money to crash the market.

Only when you simplify it down like that, removing the real world implications of setting up a new payment system for a nationwide or multi-national corporation.
1. Much like how large corporations don't pay much in taxes due to loopholes and whatever, they also don't pay merchant fees the same way a small business does.  Otherwise 7-11 wouldn't allow you to put a $0.75 candy bar on a credit card.
2. Just for scale: Best Buy has 167,000 employees.  Their 2012 revenue was 50 billion dollars.  Bitpay has 7 employees.  They cannot handle the scale of transactions that Best Buy or Newegg do on a day-to-day basis.
3. An even more important reason - the amount of people who would use bitcoin to buy things from Best Buy would be an insignificant fraction of their total customers/revenue.  But to give them that ability, it would cost millions upon millions of dollars to develop stable, reliable methods of accepting bitcoins on their website, providing refunds, paying lawers to come up with new policies for refunds/fraud/etc.  These costs alone easily dwarf the possible benefits of accepting bitcoins.  
And I'm sure there are plenty more reasons involving regulations and taxes.  I'm not saying it could never happen, but the only way that very large retailers (online or otherwise) would start accepting bitcoin is if it became commonplace enough in other markets that they would be able to reliably predict a benefit greater than those costs.  Which is exactly why if you want to use Bitcoins on Amazon, you should start by encouraging other much smaller merchants to accept them.

lol. you might want to look at what's going on at the moment before throwing money in, no? 
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:35:55
what value is it going to store if it can't be exchanged for the money that buys food and shelter? those companies that take bitcoins are not going to continue existing if they can't do anything with the coins they get. 
I get that bitcoin is going to change the world and it's never been done before and it's totally going to blow my mind, but not until it can be used for something, so you need people to be pumping money into it that way they value it. if that continues long enough then it can become what you're proposing, but it can't happen any more than I could convince 51% of the network to let me double spend.

Please stop saying flattr like a noun, it's a stupid enough name as it is.

Yeah, I love this idea that this decentralized internet based currency will free us from ... the people who provide our internet services.
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:37:09
Interesting, and plausible, but I can't imagine it happening for a long time.  But I'm sure someone will tell me that's just because I'm short-sighted.

I think "take over the world" is definitely a ridiculous standard, but I think if it succeeds it would be the main, if not only, cryptocurrency.  What role it would play remains to be seen, but the idea that it's either going to be really huge or a huge failure seems accurate.

But there's no benefit for them to do it.  They aren't going to make any more money by accepting bitcoin, their customers aren't walking into the store saying "oh, I really want this TV but I only have Bitcoin".  
If you want to buy something from Amazon or Newegg, you aren't going to pass it up just because they don't take BTC, you're just going to buy it, and that's okay.  
There are benefits to Bitcoins.  Most of them don't apply to large retail chains.  There are also drawbacks, some of those are problems specifically for large retail chains.  Focus on the merchants who would actually benefit from bitcoins.

haha I had the same reaction. there was a post here before the crash of someone telling his story of losing money in the dot com bubble.  the line that stuck out to me was that some analysts predicted Cisco's stock value was going to be higher than the GDP of the entire country

because that doesn't help his argument so it's clearly impossible
