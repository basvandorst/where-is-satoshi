Well, it does sound ridiculous if you put it like that. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:08:06
Haha! This was unexpected.
Personally, I feel good! I've done a lot of research, learnt a lot and only invested in coins I truly believe.
I feel sorry for everyone who is truly losing money, though. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:23:00
Yep, I'm quite aware now of how it feels. Make it stop, please? 
@_date: 2018-01-31 08:25:59
What I can confirm is solely based on my own personal experience:
Now I know exactly why I invested in this technology, at least way more than I knew before. 
I see this dips as a second chance for me to accumulate more, since I didn't care to inform myself enough about it in the beginning. 
Plus, by understanding a little bit of this technology, I can actually explain it to other people(friends and family, mainly) who now also understand this better and have invested and are looking to invest more. 
Give it time. It will grow. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 07:49:37
Because there's a lot of people waiting for the price to drop just enough so they can buy in and have even bigger gains.
@_date: 2018-01-31 04:39:35
I am exactly at this point. Please go a little bit lower!
@_date: 2018-01-14 01:46:43
Check out FairX, it will be coming before the end of next month and hopefully kick some ass.
@_date: 2018-01-31 04:10:58
Huh! 
I guess I was FOMOing out when I first bought in. Interesting how much I've learnt since then.
@_date: 2018-01-14 01:47:56
FairX is promising that and more and will supposedly be coming out before the end of next month.
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:08:39
Yeah, maybe you're right! 
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:56:19
No, YOU calm your tits.
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:29:11
I do! 
@_date: 2018-09-10 07:00:06
Don't you dare lying on the Internet.
@_date: 2017-12-12 11:26:55
Thanks for the video! I'll give it a watch.
@_date: 2018-09-06 01:57:40
Been awake for a while and just bought some more. 
@_date: 2018-08-30 05:43:02
If you were really emotionally detached and uninvolved, you wouldn't be reading this sub, let alone wasting so much time spreading negativity and replying to everyone that makes you feel like a victim--a direct result of your failed involvement. 
@_date: 2018-08-25 04:08:29
Tehehe! 
@_date: 2018-08-24 13:09:10
We're a week away from the deadline. How is it looking? 
@_date: 2018-08-30 05:48:35
Hahaha, I was not expecting this ��
@_date: 2018-03-12 06:54:21
How do you guys feel about this?
I enjoyed laughing at myself while watching it, but am thankful for his approach trying to explain the whole deal.
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:57:14
This bot is getting annoying, already.
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:27:30
Nice work! How did you feel once it started going back up?
@_date: 2018-02-06 10:36:29
You're right about that, but we cannot afford to  shut down everyone who's trying to expand the technology beyond us geeks.
If I was a developer, I'd be paying close attention to ideas or comments by people who may not know how to develop stuff by themselves but still know enough about the topic.
One of those assholes might be the bearer of the next million-dollar idea. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:04:53
I don't know about you, but I've learnt a lot since I got into crypto. 
What have you done with your time?
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:33:00
That would be a crazy low.
@_date: 2018-02-06 12:39:32
Everybody is free to believe whatever suits them better. 
I have done my own research and I trust the results of my own personal analysis.
It is not blind faith what is driving my decisions, I assure you that. 
I cannot predict exactly where this is going end, but I'm happily betting it won't keep going down forever.
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:48:27
I cannot wait to abandon the Mexican Peso :D
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:55:58
Ha! First time I've seen this. I laughed :)
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:06:33
By my estimates, about a shitton. 
It makes me sad just to think I won't be able to witness that.
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:04:00
I agree with you and trust me, I'm way more excited about some of the newer coins but I still think BTC can have a stupendous comeback once it reaches a low enough price.
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:40:55
This was a great argument.
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:36:32
The thing is most late buyers might not even notice that they own Bitcoin.
Remember that it should be we, the people, the ones who should control Government. Not the other way around.
Why would governments let just a few % of people (bankers &amp; other big institutions) control a worldwide currency?
The same argument applies both ways, you see. The only difference is the transparency with which that power (money) is used.
Bitcoin wins.
@_date: 2018-02-06 12:33:52
We're going around in circles with this. 
I said you were right on my previous reply, but my original point was to not insult people for trying to make an effort, whatever your opinion of said effort might be.
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:02:08
We still have to see how it reacts to Decentralized Exchanges that won't be needing to strictly pair with BTC, but I agree with you. I won't disappear.
@_date: 2018-02-28 02:15:28
Xiiiiiin chao! 
@_date: 2018-02-06 07:01:37
You should do that script, then, instead of insulting people who are trying to come up with ideas of how Bitcoin could be adopted more.
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:59:58
Why would you shatter my imagination like that, :(
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:10:14
That might still be a long way from us. On the mean time, people are taking the profits. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:57:03
I'd be happy with that!
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:14:35
Every time I read arguments like this, I can't help but imagine this leading us into a UBI in the future.
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:23:31
Anybody who sees beyond Bitcoin's current price and realizes the true value of having a technology like this in the future. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:56:12
From the moment I got in, around 16k, I knew my money could go to 0 the next day, but in the long run... it might not. 
I'm in for the long run :)
@_date: 2018-02-06 07:40:35
It depends on what is your personal definition of long term.
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:20:13
So we would "devolve" back to trading?
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:34:56
It's not about the price, it's about being adopted. And the more adoption it gets, the bigger the price will be. 
It's the same for basically every other coin.
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:17:56
Thanks, amigo!
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:02:01
Can you explain what do you mean by inflationary asset? Is that the same as an inflationary currency?
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:45:58
What about the long run, though? I bought in at 16k and am not planning on selling all of my stash until I decide to retire. On the meantime, I'm planning on accumulating as much as I can.
To me, Bitcoin is a way better savings account/retirement plan than whatever program my shitty country has to offer.
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:11:15
Personally, I'd rather have a deflationary currency that forces me to make more conscious decisions of what I should buy with my hard earned money.
@_date: 2018-11-22 00:40:23
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:57:20
I'm invested in other coins that I think have a great future ahead, but BTC is probably not gonna go away without a fight.
edit: missed a word.
@_date: 2018-07-16 06:14:38
It's been a while since I've witnessed one of these. I'm glad it is Bitcoin related. 
@_date: 2019-05-20 13:12:02
It never stops until all coins have been mined but that's still more than 100 years away.
