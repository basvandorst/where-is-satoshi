Technically blockchain.info is down which is a website. The blockchain is the ledger which powers Bitcoin itself which is decentralized over thousands of nodes.

Zebpay is the best Bitcoin buying and selling tool by far. It is not a 'wallet' per se. You do not control the keys, kinda like Coinbase but it's main purpose is to buy sell Bitcoins and Indian gift vouchers using Bitcoin.
I have used it in the past and can trust it.
@_date: 2016-08-06 18:07:05
Nah. They just don't want to encoruage wallet selling but encourage GDAX. Sell on GDAX, it's quite cheap.

And sometimes awesome apps escape the wall garden and work with their own API, (f.lux) but apple removed them and added that as a feature in the next iOS version. 
@_date: 2016-08-14 16:30:09
And you can't trade Bitcoin for money in your bank account. Poloniex is a different type of exchange. It's an altcoin exchange.
@_date: 2016-08-26 13:38:14
Which they need because MM provides the new API to store private keys of various apps completely sandboxed which increases security massively. (As long as the phone is not rooted)

What's the logic? You can't trade Bitcoin for real money on Polo?
@_date: 2016-08-06 18:09:15
According to a tweet by Brian, they bought the ETC on market and ended up with a profit because of the ETC price rise. I don't think they are compensating for ETC but instead discouraging wallet selling and encouraging GDAX.
@_date: 2016-08-02 19:28:44
Yep true. Bitfinex earns 1 million in a week sometimes. If it's more than 100 M it's big problem.

I think it's a setting called Night Shift in iOS 9. 
Also, what do you mean by 'App is Buggy'. You mean you are currently using the one from Cydia, right? 
@_date: 2016-08-23 15:09:18
Because it's slow, not for day trading and less convenient for traders only and results in low volume which means less income for Bitstamp.

I bet luke is just creating a 0 fee tx and getting his personal (former) mining pool (I think it was Elgius but I am not sure) to mine it. That is a good way to get it confirmed.

Buying 50*50 would generally keep the price low unless it's a super bullish market.
However if he is a huge bull whale who wants a big rise, it makes sense for him to have huge single buys.

We obviously will need to increase the block size at some point.
And looking at this 
why not increase it just soon instead of later. Also include Segwit as a hardfork so we don't need to wait for the 95% Segwit adoption.

Judging by the rumour from 2 months ago, it will be Bitpay.

* Download Electrum wallet and create a new wallet.
*  Next, **REMEMBER TO BACKUP THE SEED BY WRITING IT DOWN OR SOMETHING**.
* Go to your blockchain.info wallet and get the private key of this address 1JmFyHRtj7XBSnYcNHSfgMg572gzW7Yitb by going into the Import/Export tab and selecting Export unencrypted and find the private key
*  Then go to Electrum and select Wallet--&gt; Private Keys --&gt; Sweep and paste the private key
Afterwards keep on using Electrum and make sure to backup the 12 words seed to restore the wallet later on.

One of the best apps related to Bitcoin in India. You can buy Dominos vouchers, cinema tickets for pretty much any theater (using Bookmyshow) and lots of other vouchers using Bitcoin.
It also has a buy Bitcoin/ sell Bitcoin feature which I personally have never used. (I use Unocoin to buy/sell).
It is also a good wallet for a newbie because it ties your wallet just to your phone number so you don't need to backup your wallet. 
@_date: 2016-04-21 20:36:03
I don't know why but 2 BTC sounds much more cheaper to me than 900 dollars.

Actually Electrum supports xPubs of Mycelium, Electrum etc. Source: Using 5 xpubs of my Mycelium wallet on my desktop electrum.
It does not use same derivation of the wallet but it supports the public keys import. Go test it. I just learnt about it a few days ago.
@_date: 2016-04-03 18:07:42
In a sarcastic manner.
eg. "Look, Donald Trump is becoming the president, amazing"
"Amazing. Look at this. This is how crippled Bitcoin is right now."
Amazing does not always imply that it's good. Bad things also amaze people. Amaze means causing a surprise or wonder. Which this graph did.






@_date: 2016-04-03 14:52:25
It's not. It just shows how urgent scaling is required. We are reaching or have already the tx cap.
The only reason average block size is still relatively low is because some miners mine on headers and thus empty blocks. 
Posting any other title would get this post deleted. Posting the site (Bitcoin.com) will directly delete the post.
Apparently I become a troll by visiting or linking to that particular website.

Wut? Blockfolio has ads.

@_date: 2016-04-22 12:30:06
Do you even look at the markets bro? The volume due to this will be negligible compared to some of the orders of exchanges. 1000 BTC orders are pretty normal in the market.

Can you provide a tx id and also which address is yours? He most likely scammed you.
@_date: 2016-04-24 07:01:45
You will be able to if you select an account and export a xPub key and import it to Electrum. It will give you a list of addresses. 
The GUI doesn't seem to offer this feature.
@_date: 2017-12-25 09:27:30
Why would you do that when Bitcoin already supports 2 of 3 Multisig P2SH addresses?
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:55:14
It won't make ANY technical difference than sending from Segwit -&gt; Non Segwit OR Segwit -&gt; Segwit
Segwit works by separating the witness signatures and storing. And you only need signatures when spending coins.
Receiving address don't matter. The receiving address would be 'fuckyou' for all that matters and will confirm just as fast. (Note: While wallets don't permit that, receiving addresses could be anything if that matters. It will destroy those coins if you manually create such transactions.)
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:38:50
Other users have not pointed out the main advantage.
Generally futures are leveraged. Say, a future is 50x leveraged, that means for the equity of $1, you can buy $50 worth of assets. However, you get liquidated if the price moves 2% in the opposite direction of your position.
So, basically you get 50x the profits or 50x the losses than you would just normally holding the same bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 11:07:12
There were no "seeds" in 2010. You just had to backup the wallet.dat file. And this is still true currently in the official Core wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-01 11:14:06
I know about the GUI not supporting P2SH Segwit addresses but command line does (The ones that begin with 3).
 My point was about the bech32 addresses. The new address format beginning with bc. Core client does not support it currently AT ALL .
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:22:26
Obviously. I wouldn't recommend futures to anyone. It's as close to gambling as it gets. 
You can hedge your coins and buy the underlying product. But still not worth it unless you know what you are doing.
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:56:47
Yea. It is indeed. Unfortunately most wallets don't support sending to a bech32 address yet so quite useless having a bech32 wallet.

No, it can't without a (soft) fork. That's the funny thing. 
BCH was born due to hatred of Segwit. They don't have Segwit which makes LN (at least the one soon to be implemented on the Bitcoin Network) not possible.

@_date: 2015-12-07 16:58:30
I see. It makes sense but would this mean there is no way for me in the distant future to see the signatures of my tx? 
Also what would prevent an attacker miner from creating a fake transaction and including it in his block and also set up tons of malacious nodes to make the transaction seem legit? How can an outsider who doesn't run a node see the signatures and make sure the transaction is legit?
Sorry if these are stupid questions. But I still don't understand some of it.
@_date: 2015-12-12 06:59:15
I know this is controversial but create a temporary blockchain.info wallet import your wallet.dat file and send your bitcoins to a SPV wallet like Electrum, mycelium or bread wallet depending on your platform.
This works great.
@_date: 2015-12-29 03:45:03
Which wallet are you currently using? There must be a sign message option and select the address from which you want to sign from.
@_date: 2015-12-11 11:16:22
Bitfinex is a good alternative for an exchange. 
You can sell instantly for USD and after that you can verify the account and withdraw to your bank. Or you can buy BTC from it again and withdraw without verifying,

This is why the already trusted Bitcoin only sites are better.
I would say NitrogenSports is the best due to awesome Customer support, instant deposits and withdrawals and the best odds.
Directbet is also good if you like Onchain betting. I personally dislike it. Although directbet is very trustworthy. 
Cloudbet has the best odds almost always but there have been reported problems in their casino. While there have not been complains on their Sportsbook, I don't trust them. But they are great if you are an arbitrager.

Well.. That rule was never really enforced. The point right now is instead of changing that rule, vote count should be enforced.

That is called steganography. While there is no qr code in it, there are special steganography softwares where you can encode any data/text in an image and also use the same software to decrypt it.

If the user knows what they are doing and installing jailbreak tweaks from legit sources, not much difference really except they have to make sure they change the default SSH password if a jailbreak tweak automatically installs SSH.

Ya by trusted I meant sort of reputed. But really who can we trust if the website is anonymous/decentralized/non regulated? 
Same rule applies to exchanges. Kraken is called a trustworthy exchange. But does that mean it cannot run away with the funds? No. 
Ofcourse the risk lies if you don't control the private keys, you don't own the Bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-06-26 11:08:46

In a nutshell, Bitcoin is a digital crypto-currency backed by Proof Of Work concept of mining. If you don't care about the technical details of Bitcoin, just think of bitcoin as a commodity that can also act as a currency.
It has hundreds of advantages over regular banking. Some of the main ones are:
1) International. Bitcoins are borderless and can be transferred to any country.
2) super low transaction fees regardless of the amount of BTC transfered. (~$0.02).
3) Decentralized
4) Limited supply (there can never be more than 21 million Bitcoins)
5) Not controlled by any banks or governments.
For more info check out and wiki page.

No, everyone welcomes you here. If you wanna check some videos, go check World Bitcoin Network videos after you are familar with basics of Bitcoins. (They are a little advanced videos)
Also, don't worry about mining. A normal user has nothing to do with that. Just think of mining as Government printing money, except it is bitcoins. You will learn about mining by yourself. Don't worry.
When you will use Bitcoins, you will learn more and more about that. Is there any specific term you would like me to explain?

I have been a contributor here since over a year. From helping out noobs to participating in the discussion. But in the last few months I feel this subreddit is like . Almost makes you think this is a satrical subreddit. 
This has become a manipulated cess pool or hive mind. Anyone disagreeing is banned. 
Oh, and I just noticed your username. You are a mod here.. Why do you do this shit? Just because you disagree with something doesn't mean people can't talk about it. Have you ever thought you might be wrong infact?

While this is loose change for the western countries, for Bitcoin to be successful, we will need super cheap tx. Money is not uniformly divided in every country.
Our country's average income is a quarter of US's income. So the current fees for 3rd World countries are equivalent to 32 cents per tx for an average American.
@_date: 2016-01-28 13:54:26
[See my other comment](
It's not the question of whether you and I can afford it. 10 cents per tx is large. You have to take the whole earth in mind when talking about currency worth. It's impractical for a DIGITAL currency to have tx fees. While this can't be easily changed, at least the fees should be reduced to 1/10 th of the current fees in USD worth for Bitcoin to be accessible. 
Imagine having to pay 10 cents tx fees to buy a 10 cents Tic Tac according to my previous example.

General question, Trezor owners. How many approximate bitcoins/USD worth should you own to justify a trezor or any hardware wallet for that matter?
I personally don't see any use of Hardware wallet unless you own 100s (yes 100s of Bitcoins, not dollars) of Bitcoins. I have been storing quite a lot of Bitcoins in Electrum since 1 year or so and can't justify a hardware wallet.

Because coinbase can detect withdrawals from gambling sites and may close your account because of the US gambling laws. Shuffling your coins in your own local wallet is good enough for Coinbase to not detect anything.

Hash power and the longest chain determines Bitcoin. That's the point of PoW. I am not supporting either side but you can't dismiss hash power.
Anyways to see which is the economic majority, wait for Bitfinex's announcement today. They are doing some kind of trading thing today to determine which fork will get the BTC ticker. Should be announced in a few hours. That's how we'll know what the market leans towards.

You can report it as trading profits. You will be taxed but it will not be considered illegal.

No they are not. You are lucky they are allowing 2FA reset. You are supposed to backup the QR code displayed when enabling 2FA. It will take 7 days to remove 2FA. That's the point of 2FA. 
Most people would complain if they allowed to remove 2FA in little time. Use Authy if you don't want to backup anything and leave it to a centralized authority.

There are 2 QR codes. The public address is where you send Bitcoins to. The private key is what you need to spend the Bitcoins.
@_date: 2016-06-12 10:19:02
That's sorta true. Especially in altcoins.
For an example, let's take ETH. I have made this comment before and will make it again. During many stages of it's run, buying $1000 worth of ETH would increase ETH's market cap by over $100,000 which makes no sense. Take PayCoin or Ripple for example. Both actually have 0 use and are not even traded much yet Ripple is in the top 5 in market cap. 
Similar things apply to Bitcoin also but just at a much smaller scale. Price of Bitcoin is much more important than the market cap. Market cap is a good measure but not when comparing two entirely different things.

While I do agree with this, we should not advice newbies to run Core. No one would want to download the whole blockchain and maybe they will forget to backup their wallet.dat and lose their coins. That is the reason we should advocate SPV and HD clients for newbies. Afterwards the can themselves switch to core if they wish.

There are no "accounts" in Breadwallet. What you have done is set an iOS pin of the app. Since deleting didn't work, why not try another mobile wallet like Mycelium or Copay. I can't do anything without the  physical device in my hands.

Pro Tip: Even if you wan't to gamble, don't use SatoshiDice. It has a relatively high house edge (1.9 %). Use casinos with lower house edge.
The lowest trusted one I know is SafeDice (0.5 %) which means you will lose ~4 times less amount playing safedice than Satoshidice.

That's a rough estimate by taking the current Bitcoin network hashrate and an average hashrate of a CPU/GPU. The estimate is a year or two old so it might have changed by now.
BTW if I was not clear, those estimates are for GPUs and CPUs. Not ASICs.
Bitcoin works by mining blocks which are mathematically dependent on previous blocks and in return of the effort and electricity the miner put in, they get a block reward (current 12.5 BTC, halves every four years. Originally was 50 BTC).
Now, generally no one mines on their individual machines anymore. Even with ASICs mining alone, luck would play a factor and people (miners) generally prefer steadyish income. 
So they mine in what are called pools. Where a large number of miners from all around the world collectively mine and when any one miner from the pool finds a block, the reward is shared by everyone proportionally. That's why it is possible to mine little little Bitcoin. Currently almost all mining is done in pools. 
So the 0.11 BTC/month (although it can never be this precise because network hashrate keeps on changing, mostly increasing thus you get lower and lower payouts as with higher hashrate mining difficulty also increases.) is an estimated pool mining amount.
Honestly, don't worry about mining too much unless you have extremely cheap electricity and want to mine or are just interested. End user does not really need to care that much about this really.
I have massively oversimplified a lot of stuff like transaction fees, difficulty, hashing etc. Try finding some videos on YouTube. They will help if you are really interested in the internals. Also you can read the white paper written by the anonymous creator of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:20:48
It's okay. :) It's a common mistake. Mining Bitcoins nowadays require special hardware (generally called ASICs) which specialize only in mining Bitcoin. 
With the best GPU available currently in the market, it would take about 500 years to mine a full block (12.5 BTC currently) if you solo mine and that is assuming hashrate does not change. 100 times more if you use a high end CPU. And using a phone's CPU, oh boy. 
And honestly, if you are into bitcoin or think it's interesting, just buy it. Faucets are pretty useless generally. The best way to get bitcoins if now is buying. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 08:21:29
You are wrong if you think nobody is excited about 2X. Look at the miners signalling and basically any community outside this ecochamber.
@_date: 2017-10-12 18:16:58
Oi no. You don't need to buy Bitcoin in whole numbers. Otherwise there would be no point in using it as a currency.
You can buy like 0.005 BTC if you want. Bitcoin is precise upto 0.00000001 Bitcoin. And if the price rises so much in the future, extra decimal places can be added in the future.
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:04:40
That's not a miner. It's a faucet. A service that gives you bitcoins and in return shows some ads or sometimes is non-profit set up by the community.  It would take hundreds of years, maybe more to even mine $1 worth of Bitcoin on a non-specialized ASIC now.
So basically, it's not a miner. You used a service/app that gives out free bitcoins.

Import only if you know what you are doing because imported keys won't be restored from the seed. 
Instead just sweep them to one of the existing adress.

Just deposit to a trusted gambling site (Primedice/Moneypot/Bustabit) creating a new account and withdraw to different address. Preferably in random parts (eg. 1BTC deposit--&gt;0.23,0.14,0.63 etc). 
To anonymize your IP, use Tor.

I tried double spending against Humble Bundle for the fun of it. Didn't work. Only 5% of the nodes accepted that fee. Then I double spent it. So unless you are accepting 0 conf tx and using bc.info, people will be quite safe.

One last option is to contact a mining pool to confirm the tx. Otherwise wait for it to be confirmed 
@_date: 2015-09-15 08:13:06
The same OP posted on SucideWatch. Ouch!
@_date: 2015-09-17 04:51:51
I don't know about any mining pool contact details but you can find their details on their website. You can try emailing Antpool,Slushpool,Bitfury and 21 Inc's pool. Since they have done requests like before. 
Link them to this reddit thread and hopefully one of them can help you. Otherwise contact your ATM if it does not get conf. after 48 hrs (since nodes tend to drop txs after that).
And  never use that ATM again. They have a crappy code.
@_date: 2015-09-17 05:40:21
No there are many things wrong with your tx ( First of all the 4.55 BTC input is unconfirmed and no BTM should use unconfirmed outputs as inputs.
That was unconfirmed because the input of this tx  was unconfirmed
and that is unconfirmed because this tx's 22 BTC input is unconfirmed 
and that is unconfirmed because of  and a 10 BTC input is unconfirmed
which is unconfirmed because of
 11.45 BTC input is unconfirmed
which is unconfirmed because of
 14.45 BTC input
You keep on doing this for 5 times more ***AND THIS IS THE TX DUE TO WHICH ALL THIS IS HAPPENING***
Don't worry once this tx gets confirmed yours will eventually confirm
And yes this is the fault of your BTM. Once should never use unconfirmed outputs as inputs unless you are absolutely sure the tx will be confirmed because it is high priority
@_date: 2015-09-08 08:36:58
So to send a tx, I need private keys. That means the phone has to generate the keys. If the phone can generate the keys, a hacker can too. 
And from what I see ZeroPasswords looks cool but basically it scans a  QR code to login the device. So how would that work with Bitcoin? I might try this app on my friend's iPhone to understand more though.

The important thing to mention here is that the server gives you the hash of the secret server seed and reveals it after a roll (or a nonce of rolls depending on the type of website).
Also you should be able to change your client seed whenever you want otherwise it cannot be said provably fair.

Bitreserve or Coinapult. I think one of these does not work in America, not sure which one.
I have been using Bitreserve since a long time. Works great. You can store the value in USD, gold, silver etc.
Use these at your own risk. Because the websites can steal your funds.

I will write this comment as neutral and unbiased as possible but the next paragraph is my personal opinion. 
It's extremely controversial right now. I personally don't like RBF because it is being carrried out / forced without any real consensus. 
Second thing which I dislike is Electrum is **currently** not marking RBF transactions at all. 
This is extremely important for wallets to mark RBF. This is a huge deal. You clearly need to mark if an incoming transaction is a RBF transaction and it does not seem like they will add it. 
As quoted by Reddit user/rowdy_beaver "It's sort of like writing a paper check, but filling in the recipient's name and the amount in pencil so you can erase it later and change it"
Infact majority don't like RBF but it is being forced when the user updates his core wallet. 
***THIS DOES NOT MAKE ELECTRUM UNSAFE BUT A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE OPPOSE RBF.*** 
Just make sure to never trust 0 confirmations transactions.
Also, you will find more biased answers on both of the current bitcoin subreddits. This subreddit is massively "Pro Core" and the other subreddit (r/btc) was massively "pro classic" but now has become anti bitcoin. You can search for RBF in both the subreddits and try to form your own personal opinion.
I am actually pretty neutral my self.
@_date: 2016-05-23 22:13:22

@_date: 2016-05-20 19:14:12
That is not the case at all. Electrum is not even marking the RBF transactions at all so it is not "easily detectable" currently for an average user. 
Also, this is a controversial change being forced without consensus. Even massive Core fanboys have opposed RBF in the past. Electrum supporting RBF is just giving RBF credibility which (in my opinion) it does not deserve.

[I had the same problem before](
This is because by sending that amount,one of the adress will be below dust amount. To fix this type '!' to set all balance in amount and send it to your own address. Then it will work fine.
Tell me if it fixed anything.
@_date: 2015-10-12 17:18:30
Weird. It should not show two different balances. Is any of your tx unconfirmed? 
Don't worry your bitcoins are not lost if you have a wallet backup or seed backup.
If you want, you can try telling me the adresses. If there is a dust amount in anyone of its own inputs(less than 5460 sats, that might cause the problem).
If you tell me the adresses I might be able to help you.

So Reddit age determines whether FUD is FUD, huh? Account age should not even be taken in consideration. 
I, a redditor for almost 3 years and holding thousands of dollars of Bitcoins and posting on this subreddit since the last 2 years agrees with the guy that a massive block size is a must and should be prioritized. Am I 'FUDding' now?

@_date: 2016-05-01 06:51:30
Doog, I do understand that tx goes through. I do 2-3 onchain tx everyday.
The point is this occurence is not a good thing. SegWit will help but block size increase will help more. Satoshi had said that 1 MB block size was a temporary measure. 
The major thing is fees. 5-10 cents may be small for western countries but Bitcoin is international. For Bitcoin to be successful fees internationally need to be as low as possible.
I'll just quote an old comment [here](














We do not need an artificial fee market right now. Nor do we need it for atleast a few decades.

You could buy 20x futures with only 5% of holdings and sell the remaining 95% Bitcoins. If Bitcoin drops below 5% (currently ~423) you lose the 5% coins, but if Bitcoin increases your profit would stay as it was with all your Bitcoins.

First of all double spending works only against merchants accepting 0 tx confirmations.
You first broadcast an extremely low fee tx. Blockchain.info allows you to broadcast it.
Now the problem is most nodes wouldn't propogate the tx so your merchants node ( or the service they use like coin base or bitpay) will not see the tx. 
They may see the tx after a couple hours though.
If you are lucky and their nodes propogate the tx yet it is propagated to a small % of the network you can have a better larger fee tx and propogate it to another node which didn't accept the original tx.
Try this site
It will not work 99% of time.

First of all double spending works only against merchants accepting 0 tx confirmations. 
You first broadcast an extremely low fee tx. Blockchain.info allows you to broadcast it.
Now the problem is most nodes wouldn't propogate the tx so your merchants node ( or the service they use like coin base or bitpay) will not see the tx. They may see the tx after a couple hours though.
If you are lucky and their nodes propogate the tx yet it is propagated to a small % of the network you can have a better larger fee tx and propogate it to another node which didn't accept the original tx.

Ok, I have tried Coinapult before (before the recent hack) and seemed to work exactly how I wanted it to.

Unfortunately not. Bitfinex is still better (IMO) though. You need to send a scan of your passport and residence proof. 
Coinbase/Circle is still a better alternative if you are not a trader and just want to buy bitcoins from what I have heard. However as an exchange, bitfinex and bitstamp are the only good USD exchanges.

That's a DNS issue. Change your DNS in settings to Googles DNS or open DNS.
Addresses are: 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 (Googles public DNS adresses)
If you don't know how to change the DNS adresses, just google it.
Many ISPs have shitty DNS servers so many pages don't load. Doing this will guaarantee to solve the issues.
Other alternative adresses (Opendns) 208.67.222.222 and 208.67.200.200
You can switch the DNS adreesse either manually on every device or in your router settings.

I was not even talking about Ver right now. I know his tx would not be confirmed anyways . 
I am generalizing. We need low fees and much more capacity than Segwit provides. I am not even against Segwit. Did you even read my previous comments?
Segwit was supposed to come out in April. Guess what it is May. After that we have to wait for the 95% threshold. 
And I hope you are aware we will need big blocks eventually. The sooner we increase the max blocksize the better. LN will not magically solve the problem.
@_date: 2015-02-24 16:04:51

An extremely risky (I can't emphasize how risky it is), you can invest in a gambling site. There are a few legit ones and over the long run, mathematically you will be in profit.
Profits have a wide range. From loss per year to50% per year depending on which site do you invest in and also a little bit of luck.
And if the site runs away or gets shut down, you may LOSE everything.

Go look at any of my comments and see if I am supporting Classic or even mentioning Classic? I support bigger blocks but not classic. I also really love Segwit. Although I do like unlimited as a proposal.
Let us implement Segwit and increase the MAX blocksize to 8 MB or so. That will give us around 14 MB per block and this alone will be more than enough for a few decades. Plus we will have LN and other stuff also. Bitcoin could be unstoppable then and could be the next standard of value after Gold. We don't need 2x or 3x scaling. Let us scale at least 10-20x. We know storage isn't that big of problem. And Internet speeds are growing 50% every year.
Also that would mean 8 MB is the max block size but we will see very few full blocks though. While the blocks may linger around 2-3 MB for a few years this will give us enough scaling for decades.

So now I lock my coins in my Coinbase vault so it would take 48 hours to withdraw them.
@_date: 2015-10-13 14:51:36
Yes, importing saves your private key and adds it to electrum. It does NOT transfer the funds. So it cannot be retrieved from the 12 word backup seed. Use importing only if you know what you are doing.
Sweeping however makes a transaction and sends the bitcoins to an Electrum adress which you control. 
Hope that helped. If you have any questions, feel free to ask me. :)

Google gave a statement that they checked the logs and indeed no personal information other than the user id and email was used and Google made a patch on their own servers to revoke the access and Ninantic said they also will release an update to removed the permissions.

So do some other crypto currencies. Oh wait, but they are "scams", right because you said so. Let's ignore that.


Generally intra-country transfers are way cheaper and free too in many countries. And instant. Inter-Country are generally flat 20-30 USD which is okay because generally in inter country transfer amount is high.
Also, the fees are not 0.5%. They are dependant on tx size. I recently had to buy something worth 6 USD with Bitcoin and had to pay ~1.20 USD transaction fees. That's around 20% fees. That is ABSOLUTELY not okay.
Also, remember Bitcoin's strong point was low fees. I am from India and $1 fees are considered way way too much even among the moderately rich. 1 USD can buy a decent lunch and some more.


They used to be. I used to see "low fees" as a feature on bitcoin.org three-four years ago when transaction fees were two cents or less. 3-4 cents at maximum.


Really? So, what can we do. Just ignore the problems and drink our tea. There needs to be something done. 
And I am not a "shill" or anything which you'll accuse me eventually of. I own double digit Bitcoins too. But you really need to step back now a little. Most of the community disagrees with you currently. At least disable your user flair for a while.

Most of the value of Bitcoin  today is because of coinbase whether you like it or not.
@_date: 2017-06-03 07:12:51
I like how you ignored the rest of the comment.
Also, up until now all forks were done by miners. Because miners are the one who control the security of Bitcoin.
With UASF, it will first of all split Bitcoin in two. Not everyone wants UASF too if you step out of your echo chamber.
Secondly, it will prove how just ordinary people with no mining power can change and manipulate bitcoin. It would be a massive security blow to Bitcoin. 
Miners have the power. That's the point of Bitcoin.
I have a lot more to say but I am on mobile and too lazy typing. 
@_date: 2016-07-06 17:35:27
IMO yes. Not artificially crippling Bitcoin is a plus point. Other than that, core devs can always contribute to Unlimited. 
Second thing is, the code is more important than the devs. It should not matter who made the code as long as it is good code. And if you look at Unlimited, it's phenomenal.
