You need two forms of ID on gdax and only 1 on coinbase
@_date: 2018-01-20 16:42:35
I think only UK/US customers can upload documents, the only options available to me are Passport, Driver's Liscence and Photo ID. And reading into it more, I don't think there is any Photo ID in Ireland that coinbase even recognises.

@_date: 2018-01-20 15:02:03
I thought of that but I currently have only 1 form of ID and that's enough for coinbase but not gdax. I really should get an id that isn't my passport.

Yes a Blockchain without the decentralisation tech would be boring. But when people refer to Blockchain they usually mean the full package.
 The Blockchain without coin that some people advocate for is pretty stupid though, seeing as it is the currently the only incentive to keep the blockchain decentralised.

Yeah bitcoin can tons of cool features, at the expense of creating shittons of new forks. Other coins are not testnets for bitcoin, bitcoin is a rusty car with a spoiler and racing stripes thrown on, it's a testnet for whatever cryptos emerge as standard. New technology will be discovered and you won't be able to implement it in bitcoin without controversial hard forks.

So let me get this straight. You are not 16, developed a desktop app (which is €13 on the store), wrote medium articles, got a good website to present this, have a ready press kit, had done interviews and mentions and you are present on social media.
Your app is good. But every other not 16 year old adult would just toss out his first ever app with no other media or attention into the store and see what happens.
Keep up the paste and you will become big :)

She owed them money and sent a very apethetic notice that they want their money back. How is bitcoin meant to avoid that? Will satoshi send a "Sorry for your loss" card? This has nothing to do with centralised Vs decentralised and it just adds to the circle jerk that is this sub.

The fork itself isn't the problem(although many people here might be salty that bcash is stealing some of btc's potential value) I think the main problem people have is the attempts by Roger Ver to make it seem as if bcash is the real bitcoin, through his site bitcoin.com and r/btc subreddit.
Note this could just be some echo chamber BS procured created by this subreddit, I haven't looked into bcash at all.

I only called it bcash as an abbreviation, it looks like it is commonly used and googling it brings you to real bitcoin cash pages. BCH may be more appropriate tho, seems like bcash is a term used to degrade the coin

When did he say it's a terrible idea to invest? He is saying you should see a therapist because you are going all in and risking everything. The advice on bitcoin has always been the same "Do not invest more than you are willing to lose"
