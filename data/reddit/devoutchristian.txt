1 out of 2 ain't bad though.

Do people really store most of their coins on online wallets? I thought we've learned from this with all the multi-million dollar heists recently. Also, are all Bitcoins on exchanges stored in the same wallet address or do users have their own wallet addresses?

But don't all those web wallets have different addresses for every user, or do they just lump all the Bitcoins in the same wallet address?

I don't know where I said or implied that banks are better. I am confuse.

Yes but isn't the point with Bitcoin that addresses are anonymous, so nobody really knows which specific addresses belong to the exchanges. 
However on the block chain you can calculate how many Bitcoins are in specific addresses. So the point is that ~28% of the Bitcoins in existance today are concentrated in 47 wallet addresses, which most likely belong to 47 entities, whether those are people or corporations, but not necessarily exchanges if they store most of their customers coins in different addresses. Although some of them may be exchanges, but more likely the private wallets of those exchanges.

True, but it's still a fairly small number of entities that own a large number of Bitcoins no matter which way you cut it. Basically the problem in my view is that Bitcoin isn't being circulated enough because the best thing to do with it from an investment standpoint is just to buy and hold, as it is inherently deflationary.
This is why in the long-term some other cryptocurrency may become more common for people to actually use in day-to-day transactions. Bitcoin just has the upper hand right now because it's well-known, a lot of people don't even know altcoins, other than maybe Litecoin, exist.
