I *tried* to spend bitcoin in real life on Sunday at the only place in my city that takes them
We had brunch and then I asked if could pay in bitcoin.  The waitress looked at me as if I had asked to pay in goats blood.  Much faffing before announcing that the person who knew how to do it wasnt on shift.
It was kindof embarrassing as I had to borrow cash from the friends I had invited to demonstrate how easy bitcoin was to use to pay for my share :(

There used to be a site which had currency capitalisations.  Certainly in 2013 it had a larger cap than quite a few national currencies, and maybe still does.

Its possible.
The bitcoin aristocracy, also known as the '09ers" would have been quite a small group.  Pretty tech savvy, pretty ideologically driven.  That small group would have expanded through 2010, but would still have obtained high numbers of coins from the early days.  It wasnt until 2011 that it became a more of an industry.
These early miners are now already fairly wealthy.  Wealthier than they ever thought they would be, but they only get to keep that wealth if bitcoin doesnt fail, thus they have a vested interest in seeing it succeed.  
BTC price has been volative and that volatility is one of the things which has been cited as putting people off obtaining some.  Its not impossible that a couple of the early miners are manipulating the price subtly to keep it within a predetermined range as a strategy to encourage its growth.
Not sure about depressing the price tho, I think if there is such manipulation it is intended to stabilise it.

On the assumption that only US adults would hold bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-06-08 21:01:42
As I understand it, the long term stability of the blockchain is maintained by miners collecting transaction fees once all the btcs have been mined.
I'm aware that btcs will still be available for discovery until 2040, but presumably at some point the transaction fees will become more important than the potential of finding a new block.
Whats the current ratio between transaction fee rewards and mining rewards for miners and when is it predicted that transaction fees will become a greater share of miners income than newly mined coins?

I'm reasonably tech savvy, but by no means an expert.  I'm nervous about whether I have kept my bitcoins safe (I think I have, but if they all disappear tomorrow, I have so little, that I'd cry for 10 mins then shrug).
If my bank account fucked up, so that I couldnt get my wages or access to any of my savings, I'm fucked - how do I pay my rent, pay my food bills, pay for petrol...fucked.  I'm reliant on the bank to sort out the error.
With bitcoin there is no one to sort out the error.  If you fuck it up, you are penniless, homeless and on the streets until you, you personally, sort it out.  Either recover the keys in the case of savings, or persuade others to use a new wallet to pay you.
Before people will use bitcoin - really use bitcoin, there needs to be some security, beyond that which they can impliment themselves.  Almost all people can manage a bank account - sure they might fuck up a transfer, or someone can exploit them, but there are people who will help them resolve issues - be that the bank, support workers, family, charities, government agencies whoever.  
Everyone gets old - even the young.

To some extent you do.  You can deliberately earn under the tax threshold, buy only untaxed goods, live in tax-exempt properties, tax avoid and tax evade.

It is interesting tho that people want to recreate traditional structures within revolutionary technologies tho.  TBH, I see "national cryptos" as a bit like "the horseless carriage".
@_date: 2014-04-13 15:46:51
Yup - I do see it as a gimmick, but at the same time, raising interest in cryptos within Scotland, and its also providing an interesting diversion in the currency debate. 
What would be interesting tho was if a future indy scotland government started to encourage the use of bitcoin - for example persuading ATM companies to set up in Scotland, or gave the crypto industry some kind of tax relief.
Scotland is incredibly energy rich - we have oil and gas, but we also have shitloads of wind, tidal and hydro power (although minimal solar), given that mining relies on energy and the energy required to power the network will grow massively, investment in developing renewables is a critical element of bitcoin's success.
@_date: 2014-02-09 10:25:33
No, bitcoin four years ago was a high risk investment (of hardware, time and electricity).  It could easily have crashed and burned.
But now, bitcoin is here to stay, my personal opinion is that this is the lowest purchasing power that they will ever have from here on in.  The question is what is the maximum.
@_date: 2014-08-15 15:34:04
Why would high inflation be a risk to bitcoin?
Surely high inflation would encourage adoption and therefore be an opportunity.
@_date: 2014-04-12 23:47:50
Bitcoin simply isnt in a state where it could be adopted as a mainstream currency.
I agree with you about ending the discrimination of citizenship tho.  Although I think nation states will hold out as long as they can with the demand that taxes are paid in the denomination chosen by the state someone receives services from.
@_date: 2014-04-12 23:50:00
I agree, I think that btc adoption is antithetical to the concept of the nation state.  I (badly) want Scottish Independence, but at the same time, I recognise the problems with nation states.  At the moment, we have no choice whether to belong to one or not, on 18th Sept, we have a choice whether to remain part of the UK state or set up our own, but I think crypto can start to challenge the whole concept of the nation state.

mmm...thats weird.  I always put double spaces after periods.

If there were ways of cashing it out, this would be a no-brainer.  Again it comes back to infrastructure not being in place, but remittences are going to drive bitcoin forward, possibly even creating a kind of bitcoin economy in some places where local business owners have the connections to convert to local currency so are happy to accept btc for goods/services (at a premium rate).
The ability to send small amounts - say £10 in btc overseas to a country where £10 is a significant amount of money without nearly doubling it in charges is a massive advantage.
@_date: 2015-01-17 13:08:21
I'd love to use bit coin for remittances would save so much money.  Problem is that there are so few places in the global south that will exchange btc for local currency, local bit coins has drawn a blank where I am trying to send them to
@_date: 2016-06-06 08:12:09
Yes, it would be physical dollar bills.  And yes, transactions with foreign currency are illegal for egyptians unless used to buy egyptian pounds at authorised exchanges.  Legal to hold dollars/euros tho, and many keep their savings that way.
@_date: 2016-06-05 22:48:59
Almost certainly.  Ive never seen btc being sold for egyptian pounds -only dollars or occasionally euros.

Your maths is out.  
10M/7Bn is 0.0014%

As far as I know electronic transfers are still working in Greece. Presumably then they could purchase bitcoin from local bitcoin traders and do an electronic transfer.
There is also the ATM machine in Athens, but if you already have cash, then it seems that this misses the point.

You jest, but only a few days ago, the UK Court of Appeal determined that "1" does not mean 1, but 0.5

The Scottish independence movement has not tapered off at all.  The Brexit debacle has hightened awareness of how we are subject to UK rule against our own wishes and interests.
Independence is coming.

I've become *such* a bitcoin convert.  
I've been boring everyone and their dog about its potential.  Usually you get the usual arguments - but its deflationary, but it takes up loads of energy, but its a ponzi scheme, but its never going to catch on, but its only rich white Americans that like that kind of thing.
Then I send them a few satoshis and I've recruited another member of the bitcoin cult.  I feel like an evil genius unleashing an addictive revolutionary currency onto unsuspecting friends and aquaintances and getting them hooked.
Within 2 days of giving them (a teensy totty amount of) bitcoin, they have "got it".
I &lt;3 bitcoin.

Nah - the USD is simply a measure of how much goods and services you can get in exchange - so is bitcoin.  Take away the USD and exchange bitcoin for goods and services exclusively, and bitcoin has the value of the goods and services that a certain amount of btc can purchase.
@_date: 2013-11-30 12:47:43
Yup, I'd agree this has massive humanitarian potential. 
IMHO although the biggest holders are in developed countries, it will *really* take off as a mainstream currency in the developing world as the use case for fee free currency exchanges and a store of value against inflation are biggies - particularly as an alternative to Western Union etc, for people currently living in the West but wanting to send home money to their families in the developing world.  
You might be interested in an article I wrote on women and bitcoin as well - again - men are the main current (large) holders, but bitcoin has particular advantages for women.
@_date: 2013-11-20 23:36:01
I think there are probably going to be a range of currencies.  Bitcoin will become legendary, as the ultimate store of value, but trading at too high a purchase price for people to work with it.  Alts - the most obvious currently is litecoin, will take up some of the slack, possibly becoming industry related - so there will be transport coins (say) which are discounted from their btc price within the sector, and food coins, possibly also regional/national coins as g'ments attempt to regulate and intervene while maintaining some of the advantages of a cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2013-10-13 14:20:45
I suggest researching the old LETS schemes.  Lots of councils used to support them tacitly.  Bitcoin is kindof like the global equivalent, so you might get some ideas from what they used to do.
@_date: 2013-12-03 08:06:36
I've started doing similar.  Anytime someone disses bitcoin, I offer to send them a little but only around 1c-3c worth (I'm coin-poor, hell, i'm just poor in general).  Usually they take me up on the offer, and having a bit of a stake in it, even tho its tiny usually makes them investigate it properly rather than just automatically dismiss it.
@_date: 2013-10-12 10:21:40
Can no-one trace DPR's wallet?  Surely a wallet with 600K btcs should be pretty spottable - no?  
I'm not talking about cracking it, just identifying it.  Most large wallets will belong to early miners, and will have pretty identifiable patterns compared to one which is comprised of the profits of drug deals.
If there is no such wallet, then the FBI are lying.
@_date: 2013-11-20 23:17:24
The question is no longer is the company already worth a billion dollars, but how many bitcoins is it worth?
