Maybe they can start by making it easy to use their ATMs?
I know they have to comply with AML/KYC, but as Joe Consumer who just wants to try out this new Bitcoin thingy, I don't care who's responsible for the inconveniences of a new product.
Though it probably wouldn't hurt if they described exactly why (which specific government regulations) they're making you give them your cell phone number, scan your hand print, scan your ID, etc.
@_date: 2014-04-27 04:32:38
I assume most people associate any sort of stamp/writing on a dollar bill as a joke or crackpot marketing.  This is not the way to encourage anyone to use Bitcoin.

Please do give an example of these "male centric" sources of Bitcoin information...
@_date: 2014-05-02 16:18:54
I also am disheartened by the U.S. Robocoin experience.  It really paints Bitcoin in a bad light.  Anyone on the fence about Bitcoin, and especially anyone who knows nothing about Bitcoin, is going to be turned away by the intrusive privacy invasions required just to get some bitcoins.
If I was making an ATM in the U.S. where AML/KYC regulations abound, I would make sure I did the minimum amount to comply legally and **I would have the ATM explain with each privacy intrusion which regulation required it to ask for ID, hand prints, SSN, etc.**  Make sure that Joe Public knows that the government is behind these privacy intrusions, not Bitcoin.

Slashdot announced the release of the first client.  I downloaded it and left it running for a few days, accumulating hundreds of bitcoins.

Sadly, this is true.  Slashdot was a must-read tech site years ago, and in fact was where I first heard about Bitcoin.

That's pretty disingenuous.  (Unless they're tearing the paper wallets up in your face.)  Let them keep a piece of paper and then when the USD vs. BTC exchange rate goes much higher and that piece of paper is much more valuable, they will become interested.

Is "cryptocurrency" really that bad of a word?  I wouldn't use it at all with when explaining Bitcoin to my grandmother, but otherwise I think it's fine.  Crypto is short for cryptography, which is a core concept of Bitcoin and how ownership of bitcoins works.

Coinbase is very trustworthy, but it will take approximately 10 days before you get your bitcoins.
With Localbitcoins, it's almost instant but you have to trust the individual selling the coins.  Most of the scams seem to be on the USD end of the transaction, so that helps you, but I'd still recommend meeting in person and handing someone cash instead of just depositing into a bank account.

That's fine if the person asked you about Bitcoin.  Good for you.
However, if you're just handing paper wallets to acquaintances and telling them to go learn how to use them in a few days or the money will be gone, well... if I was one of those people I'd just be annoyed.  Giving me $10 and telling me to go learn how to use or else you'll take it back... that just comes across as a bothersome, smug "gift."

They are painfully slow to buy bitcoins, but they work.  Once you get your account confirmed (week) and have made your first purchase (another week), you can get your bitcoins within 4 days.  Supposedly faster if you also add a Visa card to your account.
So basically to get your first chunk of bitcoins, Coinbase is good, and seems a little bit safer to Joe Public than Localbitcoins.  Still annoying to use, though.
