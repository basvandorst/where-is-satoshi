How about the "middle class who don't want to do hours of research"?  What's the likelihood of adoption without a more accessible entry point?
We're \~30 years into the Linux "revolution" and from a consumer standpoint it's still an obscure nerdy hobby.

Shouldn't identical numbers believe it inflates the price of an asset?  There being exactly as many longs as shorts and whatnot...

What is the "scheme"?  Every day the futures resettle, so if you think BTC will be 5k in June, the cash should trade its way there over the next 3 months, and the futures will be marked to market accordingly.
For your "short slaughter" scenario, the cash would have to gap up to 5k (or whatever your June target is), in a single day, and even then traders have \~1500 collateral to blow through before they get a margin call.

The major card processors are pretty strict about any charges that would make cards less appealing -- I think they'll only allow it if it's an "alternative" venue (like a convenience fee over the phone), and a flat amount vs. percentage, otherwise you risk getting dropped as a merchant.

By this logic I should buy as much water as possible, because it's useful and scarce.  And I should sell gold, since it becomes less scarce every time they dig up more of it.
There is no economic basis for saying something should just increase in price without bound.  Provide a target price if you can demonstrate it's undervalued, but just yelling "my stuff should go up in value" has no basis.

Close to zero, it's only going to be edge cases that failed or saw a Zimbabwe future.  More typical is going to a 1:1 USD link.  All those coins you listed aren't currency/money, they're just convenient forms to hold bullion in.

Wheat is not a "stock", stocks are shares in companies.  If you buy wheat on the spot market, it's wherever your seller hands it off.  If you buy wheat futures (what I assume you meant by "stocks"), you get your wheat at the contract's expiry (tied to crop seasons), at the delivery point specified in the specs.
For Kansas City Wheat, there are 4 delivery points (KC, Hutchinson, Salina, Wichita):

If few people are aware of it, it hasn't started a new economic era.  Bitcoin would be better served by efforts to simplify entry and ease of use, versus all this televangelist cheerleading.

I don't care if they deliver me bitcoins or how big the futures open interest is (of course there's no limit, that's how all futures work), if they're letting me buy futures for 5k while selling spot for 10k...
@_date: 2019-12-09 07:31:04
This is not how spreads works. No exchange owns the spread since futures and spot trade on separate venues. Front running does not apply, since I can still get the bid/ask price regardless. I don't know what you're calling "dibs" but you've not given any realistic scenario where someone could manipulate spot using futures without offering the entire market unlimited arbitrage.
The fact that there's no arbitrage whatsoever, not to mention trillions, shows that your claim doesn't exist. Who's to say bitcoin's price isn't inflated upward by Fed liquidity, like everything else? (besides the fact that it would be working for you)
@_date: 2019-12-09 03:59:32
No "proof" or "insider"ness is needed. I have a futures account, and bitcoin exchange access. If someone pushes futures prices below spot, I buy them while selling spot and collect the difference when they converge. And so does every more sophisticated and better funded player.

Name a stock or futures exchange that has gone belly up.  Your money goes to the counterparty of the trade, which would be a farmer for wheat.  Your "stocks bad" rambling and apparent lack of knowledge of other financial markets is going to do far more harm to bitcoin advocacy than good.
This "revolution" isn't going to happen based on blind ideological cheerleading, that's called a cult.

There's also no reason a country would WANT to.  If they did, they'd find it much more convenient to just use USD or another "hard" currency (which a few tiny nations do indirectly by linking their currency 1:1 with the dollar), which avoids all the infrastructure issues.
But their major drawback is the same thing you count as a benefit:  they lose the ability to control monetary policy / manipulate the currency supply.
@_date: 2019-12-04 05:08:29
This is not how futures work. They settle to the underlying commodity, not the reverse, so artificially pushing the price in either direction from the spot market just gives someone else arbitrage.
@_date: 2019-12-06 20:27:33
Of course it's not, otherwise I and many others would do it. That's what makes the "they're using futures to suppress spot" argument silly.

For all intensive porpoises, 400ish million is a gazillion.  To 99.9% of the planet, it's a bunch of zeroes, Urkel.
The lesson here should be that moving a gazillion once on the cheap is great, but far better marketing would be something people could relate to.  Like, say, totaling up what the average American pays in a year for all his bills, transfers, maybe investments, etc, then seeing what doing all of that in BTC would run him.

I'm sorry you've convinced yourself that a conspiracy is keeping Bitcoin from hitting a million or wherever you think it should be. Refusal to learn or acknowledge how futures work will prove very expensive for you if BTC is actually being artificially inflated, like every other asset in existence.

@_date: 2019-12-09 05:44:46
Doing that would bring the spread back together. Or invite more manipulation, meaning more free money to more people who would leap at the opportunity, is that what you're suggesting? Because it sounds like you're convinced of a conspiracy against your long position regardless of how markets work and how easily identifiable and exploitable it would be.
What if unlimited Fed liquidity is doing what it's done to every other asset, and artificially inflated the price? IE pushed bitcoin prices artificially higher?
@_date: 2019-12-07 22:09:34

I'm not even talking about a currency ban, the original question was how do you have an official currency.  And the answer is that you declare it the national currency to be legally used for all debts.  Taxes, fees, wage laws, legal judgements, contracts, etc.  If you screw things up enough people will move to alternatives, but otherwise you're going to have a huge inertia of people who charge you in that currency and expect you to accept it.
If your aim is some organic movement of people moving from USD/EUR/etc to BTC, it's not going to be all these ideological memes about how nobody realizes the revolution has already happened or whatever, and it's not going to be charts about how the biennial midpoint is ACTUALLY the most important metric.  It'll be by making BTC accessible and easier to use, day to day, for hundreds of millions of people.  Can your aunt set up a wallet and convert easily to and from BTC?
@_date: 2019-12-30 21:41:14
It's not a "shock" if it's known months/years in advance.  Supply shock would be if tomorrow some portion of bitcoins blinked out of existence (or alternately, if enough of the mining pool was destroyed to seriously alter new coin discovery).

Only if someone is willing to continually hand me money as I sell expensive spot and buy cheap futures which will either converge to spot, or settle at spot.  If you believe this is what's happening, you're saying there's unlimited money to be made, so why not take it?

"Legal tender for all debts public and private".  Or, for nations with failed currency, the equivalent is "if we find you dealing in USD (or other non-failed currency), we'll seize it and arrest you for undermining the People's Republic".

It reduces supply, but doesn't impact demand.

If you'd been buying both for more than a year, then in the 2017 run-up you'd have bought relatively less BTC and more equities, then the reverse as stocks ran up and BTC got slammed.

Most engines do run near full throttle, without degradation, because they're optimized for a steady load: generators, trains, planes, and boats spend the majority of time "cruising" near max throttle, because extra capacity would be wasted.
Cars are unique in the very wide range of speeds and accelerations they need, which is why you don't design them to run nonstop at 5x average power need, but if you just needed to do 80mph nonstop you'd use a small engine at nearly open throttle, vs. a 3-400hp idling at 15%.
