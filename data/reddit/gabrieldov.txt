sort of require trust on dash also... i'm not checking their code and even if I would, probably wouldn't understand most of it. also, even if I did, the nature of the system premise (total anonymity) seems very risky to me in a digital environment.

Yep, that's right. Investing high is never a good idea, specially after a peak like that. I mean, come on... But hey, on the bright side, if that person just kept the 2013 inflated btc till 2018... a 5 year investment, maybe he can still make some money.
In any case, 2013 was sort of an exception, now the market is much more mature. Not saying that 2013 couldn't happen again - but that at least people know have tools to be skeptical about sudden highs. This also explains the current strong resistance the coin is meeting at 570 (on its way to 600 or back a bit lower at 520)...

They are not cheap, maybe cheaper than will be next year, but still 100% yearly return of investment if you invested last August... Don't sell low and you'll see the magic - the price will go up.

If the executable file can be tampered with at the website, doesnt' the key and message also? I mean, could the attacker just post a file with his key and also add it to the website? Where can this key be verified with 100% certainty that it belongs really to the BTC team?
If website is hackable and core there is not safe, wouldn't the best measure to remove the executables from there and add it to a safe place for download and only with keys - also safe and verifiable through several different public sources known to be official Core sources?

"Bitcoin exchange chief". Is it me or this title reads more pompous from what it actually is? If I didn't knew better I would think the Bitcoins exchange (the place where all Bitcoin is exchanged) boss was kidnapped and Bitcoin is in trouble. Or that maybe he's the exchange  chief of the Bitcoin tribe?

Best advice: dollar cost average, treat it as savings account. Hold for long term, tech is still under development. If you buy small amounts, leave at exchange for 3 months and just then transfer coins  to your private key (preferable hardware wallet and preferable to wait for when tx fees are lower and no congestion). This will save you fees and valuable Bitcoin from the future.
Also, most importantly, continue educating yourself and trying to learn technical aspects and even how to program and handle programmable money - you'll be amazed by the possibilities you have and by educating yourself you'll also feel more secure about your investment and savings account - and it will be important for when you are tempted to sell at a crash because you know better and can look beyond the fear.

Interesting... Litecoin got to over 50% segwit and now back to 20 something... SAME PERIOD
@_date: 2017-03-24 20:16:19
All this will make is more people buy mining equipment because of the menace (arms for the race) and once again the network will have increased hash rate because new miners will come to play the game. Some people see 51%split as the end, others see it as 51% opportunity to take their place in mining... Miners are not perpetual and there's a new miner every day, specially the one's smelling opportunity in the air 
@_date: 2017-03-28 07:58:20
He sells equipment for everyone willing to pay. 2 networks means 2 sales channels for his equipments... He's pumping up his business, that's all. With possible split FUD, maybe sales increases for people wanting to profit in both chains. 50% split means 50% opportunity for some entrepreneurs that will buy equipment for the "hash race" 
@_date: 2017-03-24 19:34:55
Not if you plan to use your mining equipment to mine some other ASICS Alt coin that's centralized and being pumped recently. Divide and rule.

The indecision is what makes fees go up... Also a problem with the algorithm that calculates fees and some ghost transactions making all fees go up for everyone.

Guys, show some respect for the king of the Bitcoin altcoins: 
Look at all those coins - they are part of the Bitcoin decentralized development. Bear in mind that some Core developers grew from the minor leagues (creating their non-competing, different algorithm, smart altcoins) into the major leagues (Bitcoin Core) with the experience acquired from the development of the altcoin - and also after accumulating BTC stake from selling such altcoins for BTC. Some altcoins are better than others and real Jedi grow in them. Litecoin shared Scrypt mining is a great environment for experimentation and has been a great school for a lot of young devs. Cheers!

First, I'm not socialist. About paying for promoting your opinion, people that don't have money will not be able to promote their ideas on the internet? So what's the point of the internet? It becomes just another "privileged" forum. Some people see only money as proof of work. I believe time is also proof of work. Trolls might not pay with money, but they certainly pay with something of value (at least to themselves) - their time, their life. Cheers, Gabriel.
@_date: 2017-04-21 06:22:43
Yes and no. We need to use/trade it with people/businesses that use/trade with it and don't convert it immediately back to fiat. 
@_date: 2017-04-07 04:46:41
This is a incredible example of what is happening in to bitcoin right now on a smaller scale (its small brother). The irony is so big that we as users should be really awake. Miners in f2pool should respond heavily by pointing their miners to other more serious and committed pools.

Reading again and again this quote, the more it grows to me as a funny quote. Guess he was trying to be funny, laughing about Charlie's copy paste skills. A bit irresponsible though, but crossing my fingers for it being just some good old Chinese humor. Hate to see so much hate being spilled here to our friends in China, we owe a lot of gratitude to them and they are fighting the good fight on their complicated political environment, bringing development to small communities and putting their energy to good use. Arise chickuunnn!

Makes sense to me. I would say bitcoin hardware is, like, bitcoin itself.
@_date: 2017-04-21 06:20:40
Sort of cool, but mostly pointless and hurts price. Unless Steam holds value in bitcoin and doesn't converts it immediately to fiat. Also, for such small transaction it's not a great value transfer. But if I was a kid, that would be my preferred form of payment because of the lack of other option I could control... So maybe there's something to it. 
@_date: 2017-04-09 05:15:15
Really much more useful and straightforward than many Ethereum ICOs and other tokens that are being pushed around. I personally wouldn't buy any, but that's because I dont have spare money to spend on any shit token. But hey, from all the shit tokens available, this one at least has some art value added to it. 
@_date: 2017-04-08 21:28:01
Why not installed software on miner is the signaling? It's unfair to have people them blocking the development while they use Core software. I mean, put your equipment where your mouth is... No?

Maybe provide scarcity of up/down votes by giving to every user, let's say, around 50 of each per month. Then people would still give votes, they would just rationalize their voters better.

Google and Adobe are great companies, but when I need support from them, takes a lot of time and all are outsourced to overseas centers... As someone stated here, sometimes it just means they are busy or need to go through other departments to get your answer.

Attaching opinion to wealth is not a good idea. This place needs to be free in order to allow free speech. Maybe equal opportunity with limited (rationalized) votes per user would be best

Nevertheless, great news and might expose more people on the demand side wanting to store value and get salary in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-04-08 18:34:37
Only if store owners are saving and paying their providers and staff with bitcoin too. If they instantly convert it to yens at market price, it actually increases sale pressure and can bring price down (lots of coins that need to be sold quickly)... It all depends on the demand side....

Jihan "Point of Failure" Wu is making all possible to gain attention to his position of power within the BTC and LTC networks. Doing a great job - expect a bright future for him and all his associates.
@_date: 2017-04-09 16:12:29
There's not much to it actually... This community is the one that decides what is bitcoin: 
All the rest is just speculation and opinions. Lucky us they hear us at all, I believe they shouldn't - and all other players in the sphere should just thank them or join forces (actual programmers) there to make changes from within if they want. Miners want bigger blocks? Pay programmers to join bitcoin github, gain influence, show actual work with code, show competence, and then, only then, with the code ready for deployment, present it to the relevant community - the SW community. BTCU is just another fork, like many other forks that Bitcoin has.

Not sure, this is relative to every specific location. But for sure still not widely spread offline. BTC makes more sense online for now, for online retailers.

Dude, there's people that need the Bitcoin to pay for stuff and have other person on the other side that is stupid and wants the useless paper for some reason...

Total FUD. Opposite could be truth. 90% or more of all BTC cryptonodes are enforcing core.
@_date: 2017-05-23 22:31:08
To be fair, it seems the vested interests (not only miners - all the suits that signed the deal) have less control over LTC than they have over BTC. I could be wrong and they are covered up from both sides - but I personally will go where Core goes no matter what happens (for now and as long as Core remains Core - open)
@_date: 2016-10-14 15:17:34


Still randomness is applied and that cannot be replicated. 
Also, that grey minority of 3.7% is a great number of nodes that are not centralized (as big as the centralized nodes of the other implementations) that are preventing attacks from being successful without at least raising a red flag. If Roger Ver and other whales are going short on Bitcoin Core right now, at this momentum in time, it would be a dick move.
@_date: 2017-05-22 11:41:56
Closed door meetings don't mean nothing for bitcoin. Compromise without actual research, test, engineering? Not bitcoin.

Bad joke. This is not the spirit. Let them sell their coins at their own free will if they control their keys. What we really should do is ask them to dump all their coins to prove their loyalty to their failed fork.

They're all putting money on this, this is a corporative move - some players allied to take on the Bitcoin name for altcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-08 08:25:13
@_date: 2017-06-14 07:00:56
Basically, basically? They are announcing an altcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-14 09:50:14
Again, with the current market and maybe with their realized positions (some whales made a lot of BTC, cryptos and FIAT) during the last 6 months - now they feel they are ready for some chaos. Remember Bitmain is the producer of the "arms" for this hash-race. Just too many variables at the current crypto environment - some we can see, others we can imagine, others can even be filled at some agency as top secret. Difficult to know what are the incentives that are playing out here - we can only see that some actions from the Bitmain side look very irrational from the grassroots Bitcoiner perspective.
@_date: 2017-06-01 10:08:26
So not that useless the redundancy with a few changes to consensus and different mining hardware that was launched over 5 years ago. It is now on the forefront of the scaling debate, breaking paradigms and helping push forward technological advancements in the face of stagnation. True decentralization is not possible without these "useless copies". This is exactly the kind of tool that allows BTC to live forever regardless of any political attack to it.
@_date: 2017-06-14 09:36:30
Yeah, that makes sense. But we saw with ETH and ICOs how the market can be dumb and still fall and buy into their hardfork for speculation (tho making it profitable for them to mine a altcoin that they would call Bitcoin)
