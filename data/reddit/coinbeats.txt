A peer to peer connection with individuals huh....hmmm...
@_date: 2014-01-13 18:15:10
Hahahahaha this made me literally laugh like a idiot in front of everyone at work. 
@_date: 2014-01-21 19:43:17
Doge doge doge :)
@_date: 2013-12-09 16:46:57
This gives me an idea.....
@_date: 2013-11-13 07:40:36
This makes Kinkos so much more fun to goto now ^_^

I carry separate wallets. A different one for all the different denominations. My $1 bill wallet has the most in it typically.

I read Benakee" (not sure if the spelling is right) the guy that fucked Walts wife in Breaking Bad and thought, "Hey wait a minute, he isn't real this article is fake" then I was like (.___.  )
@_date: 2013-12-19 00:37:53
How would I go about doing so?
@_date: 2013-08-26 08:13:28
Thats a good question...
@_date: 2013-11-27 09:30:56
This makes me want to plant my BTC in the ground to see what it'll grow into. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 09:58:42
Ive seen trees fall pretty hard.
@_date: 2013-12-19 16:38:05
Ummmm what if it rains or something? I suppose the devices could be in a greenhouse or something but still...
@_date: 2013-12-12 07:56:44
Dope I'm in Colorado Springs. Might have to make a trip one day
@_date: 2013-12-15 08:44:00
I don't know what to believe :(
@_date: 2013-08-26 04:04:21
I know a personal seller that was trading at that price earlier.

One took a fall in a laptop and the other one got squished :( the second reads all the partitions except the one my
BTC is on
@_date: 2013-08-25 08:37:50
Hey thanks! We appreciate it!
@_date: 2013-12-17 09:25:30
I have two messed up hard drives with I think ~3-5 BTC on them. I wish I could get them to work just for a moment I could copy my wallet.dat info over :(
@_date: 2013-12-28 07:56:54
😭 wow how crazy I couldn't imagine. I don't even know what I'd do
@_date: 2013-08-25 18:27:31
That's our idea, imagine youre at a concert &amp; for whatever reason you forgot your cash...you could pay for merch or something with BTC! Theres so many possibilities.
@_date: 2013-08-25 00:36:26
:D anticipation got the best of us! But the main site is far from hideous. We're shooting to attract some musicians, call it a pre-release. 
Launch is right around the corner though.
@_date: 2013-12-19 12:10:54
They should make a "To the moon!" set. That would be pretty cool
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:54:22
I can't wait to try this out, I was just talking about how I wished there was something u could do with an old drive. :D
@_date: 2013-12-03 15:12:30
When I decide to withdraw ill keep this in mind, thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-12 07:51:02
Quick someone fly me out using bitcoin with cheapair so we can shoot this!
@_date: 2013-11-11 05:44:53
Id love this if this used Linux Mint &amp; Multibit with it.
@_date: 2013-11-18 15:24:13
I say give him half fiat &amp; half BTC. That way he has options. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 07:07:32
I definitely had a  moment.
@_date: 2013-12-08 01:52:12
But now that tattoo artist knows your BTC secret ;) haha
@_date: 2013-11-27 09:34:40
Someone say absinthe??? Count me in!
@_date: 2013-11-11 20:15:14
As many as you want! Send some artwork as well
@_date: 2013-12-17 18:30:14
And I'll be left high &amp; dry :(
@_date: 2013-11-24 09:20:35
This is kinda how I envisioned my site 
@_date: 2013-12-21 22:20:05
All I can donate is dogecoin :(
@_date: 2013-12-01 02:16:28
You should write for The Onion, this reminded me of it haha
@_date: 2013-12-19 13:19:54
You spelled hodling wrong
@_date: 2013-12-08 00:23:19
The best way is finding someone you trust when it comes to PayPal 
@_date: 2013-11-13 07:42:17
Next time I'm back home I'll have to swing by!
@_date: 2013-11-11 19:51:06
I wish my Subway did this Id go get me one of those new Creamy Sriracha subs 
@_date: 2013-12-19 13:24:07
Well looks like I'm going to be renewing my services on time now :)
@_date: 2013-12-24 22:33:05
Those tricky Chinese!
@_date: 2013-11-12 07:07:01
Twitters a good promotional tool. Wouldn't hurt in my opinion
@_date: 2013-08-25 19:15:59
Folks I know are selling at 117 currently....
@_date: 2013-11-11 04:50:35
It would be cool to have your music on Coinbeats.com =D
@_date: 2013-12-19 13:05:40
Reminds me of Steve Brule after reading this. I need to set up my dogetips too now I think about it. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 18:37:00
Right. Because there's money to be made with the ad revenue 
@_date: 2013-12-02 19:34:38
I've been paid with BTC for Dj gigs before so he wouldn't be the first. I didn't think to write on reddit about it though. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 09:24:46
Can one add to their hosting plan with BTC as well???
@_date: 2013-12-28 05:50:34
I'd shit my pants if I ever posted I lost all my $$ and some tipped me $1000. I damn near shit my pants reading that tip!
@_date: 2013-12-09 16:37:29
For our health!
@_date: 2013-12-30 09:03:21
Seems like not too many people that are musicians use bitcoin and if they do they don't let it be known...
@_date: 2013-12-12 07:11:54
Get the camera &amp; ill be the actor
@_date: 2013-12-28 08:02:43
If buy a buncha alt coins I'm thinkin....
@_date: 2013-12-22 10:31:31
Cool this is the same concept my failed site was about haha
@_date: 2013-12-19 13:01:58
That would be nice
@_date: 2013-11-11 19:46:42
Send me some links &amp; an address youd like donations to and ill get you on there
@_date: 2013-11-21 07:21:54
I wouldn't know, I have not gotten a ticket in years. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 06:09:42
So come tax season...say nothing if anything isn't regulated??
@_date: 2013-11-11 05:26:00
