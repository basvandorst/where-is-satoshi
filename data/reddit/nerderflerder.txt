@_date: 2018-08-18 19:23:11

@_date: 2018-05-07 00:03:43

Interesting. Thanks. 
So how could this individual say that’s retail fiat whales are buying when the mining pools would be considered “whales selling” are you referring to the pools as in nice hash or the like selling customer pool profits or private pools 
@_date: 2018-06-29 09:10:52
What wealth. Never had any to begin with. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 05:16:41
Never noticed.

@_date: 2018-06-29 14:43:35
I couldn’t care less what people on reddit think. 
What is your unending fetish with paid shills??
@_date: 2018-06-29 07:58:17
What people have to realize is that this is a casino. You drive all the players out you dont make any money. They gotta pump it again some time./ 
@_date: 2018-06-29 05:59:12
Naw man. Either way I win. I still get a steak dinner so no loss either way for me. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 07:24:11
Nope. None. All gone. Along with yours. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 07:07:43
Or perhaps your the paid shill go say that they are...
@_date: 2018-06-29 09:11:38
Yea. Shoulda woulda. Too much effort. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 08:00:21
Their true belief that BTC is gonna make that high pitched whistle a plane makes hurdling towards ground before impact. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 07:55:42
Has to maintain an uptrend. Cant go 50% parabolic. Totally agree. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 09:11:21
Updoot. Finally someone.
@_date: 2018-06-29 05:58:26
I guess all we can do it wait and see. The overwhelming sentiment here tells me bottoms close. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 05:56:45
I’ll look back fondly at this EOY
@_date: 2018-06-29 07:15:07
It took a long time. He doesn’t get money. He does construction. Tons of YouTube videos and Netflix documentary’s. Hopefully we’ll be able to show them up one day and prove we do know what we’re talking about. I need that recognition I can do something right and totally contraire and not mess it up... god speed my friend. 100k btc 
@_date: 2018-06-29 05:16:57

@_date: 2018-06-29 07:23:34
Dude. I couldn’t care. I don’t think anyone here is a paid troll. Just playing devils advocate.

Whole new meaning to “tube steak” 
@_date: 2018-06-18 08:05:36
Not at all. Big stupid alert. Someone probably just mistyped. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 05:16:28
Lol I know. 
It just has to reach my number. Not stay there for that date. I think we’ll blow past it. 
@_date: 2018-06-17 07:58:24

@_date: 2018-06-29 22:03:25

YESS THANK YOU SO MUCH. 
@_date: 2019-01-26 22:07:55
Trying to find an amazing article for reference and CANNOT find it for the life of me. It has to do with governance and how commits get appended and who has the masterkeys to actually update the git... Anyone. Im thinking it was hackernoon, maybe medium. Thx
@_date: 2018-11-20 17:08:36
Hahahahaha. Yep he wins this round. 
@_date: 2019-01-09 16:46:08
@_date: 2018-03-10 23:08:21
that doesnt make much sense. segwit failed fork was like 6 parties if i recall correctly. You can totally have a central voice for where the networks going. Ex.- were implementing lighting network, lightnings at 1000 nodes...
