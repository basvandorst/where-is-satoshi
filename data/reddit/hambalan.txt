You are very welcomed....
When I first started, I did worry about the ability to decrypt BIP38 being restricted to the original app / html  used to generate the address. I am relatively confident that now, most up-to-date app / html sites can do the encryption and decryption interchangeably. 
As a safeguard, I do keep a set of test keys to test new setups before using them for real.

Thanks, but I am a little bit confused about your "bitcent" - my account was credited with 0.00000311BTC, which is equivalent to 0.002USD.

Hope you have already solved your problem and found something to eat. It had been more than two hours since you first posted your request, the kids must be very hungry by now!

Very interesting story.
Just one question, I can't find any exchange dealing with STR, and what is the market rate for STR/BTC?

This is not from a phishing site. All details in the email are mine and genuine, thus the need to block out the "sensitive" info.

Unfortunately, I can't decipher their bitcoin donation address 2c99ccfc-d846-4e6f-8ffd-598a8c7fa92c This looks more like a blockchain.info wallet identifier

I know. But in the meantime, your wallet is only secured via a 4-digit pin! Once you gain access to the account, I understand that you can transfer (pay) to another address without too much hindrance.
You can set up 2FA or set a limit to the allowable amount to be transferred if your look deeper into "settings", but there is no clear warning about the danger of leaving your account "as is" without further safeguards. 
This, in my opinion, is a sure recipe for disasters, particularly for newbies who are not too aware of the need to secure, secure, and secure bitcoins held by an online wallet.

I did nothing to the setting of the wallet since I created it over a year ago. I am surprised at the email as Blockchain appears to be welcoming me as a new wallet holder. and put all my account details within the message.
@_date: 2014-07-08 07:39:56
Both BIP38 encrypted addresses (beginning with 6P...) are valid. They are different because one is derived "raw" (from bitaddress), and the other one is converted from a known private key (when you re-encrypt on BPW).
You might also want to take a look at [this] ( in a previous thread.

I have to reply first, then they'll provide me with their address. Can't be too careful.

Definition of "good": to be desired or approved of; having the required qualities; of a high standard.
I rest my case!
@_date: 2014-09-11 07:38:45
Very nice and easy. Just two suggestions:
1. put the addresses on one line rather than breaking them into several, perhaps underneath the QR code?
2. get rid of the colourful dots after the required entropy was created in order to keep the interface free of distraction. In any case, definitely get rid of them when the addresses are printed.
Just my two pennies....

I must say the fee of 0.1% is not too bad at all.
However, why is the BTC withdrawal fee twice the "standard" at 0.0002?

You can send transactions using your private key. But beware: if you don't send the whole amount contained in this key, you must input a change address to receive any residual amount.

This looks like a do-it-yourself bitcoin paper wallet. 
If so, anyone contemplating this in future might want to use a more "attractive" design. Bitcoinpaperwallet and many other sites do offer different designs.

If you can post here, then you can use a search engine to find alternatives to send money aboard.
Using the "big two":
MoneyGram, available from all UK Post Offices, will cost you £4.50;
Western Union, if you use your bank account and do the transfer online, will cost £2.00
Frankly, I am more shocked at your willingness to pay the bank than their fees.

BIP38 encrypted address should be "decryptable" using any standard wallet (app or html)
I tried your "procedure" twice and both work OK (note: using both English and unicode passphrase)
The only thing I would suggest is to update your bitaddress.org html file to the latest version (2.9.3 on its website, but 2.9.5 on GitHub)

Relevant paragraph from page 5 of the briefing paper:


guarantee the value of their notes while still adjusting their
supply to market demand. Although it is likely that GBP would
be used as the reserve currency in this way given the existing
network for GBP payments, there should be nothing stopping
banks from issuing notes redeemable in something else, like US
Dollars, gold, stock market index funds, **or even ‘alternative’
currencies like Bitcoin.** This would allow for some degree of
competition in currency, theoretically allowing Scottish banks
and consumers to switch away from the GBP should the Bank of
England begin to seriously mismanage the currency.

Great exchange, but no liquidity for USD trades. Better for EUR, but still low volume, comparatively speaking.

thank you very much!

If you are going to buy daily, you would be better to go with an exchange, though there will be some verification process.
Kraken should be good for your purpose, though you would need to send EUR to them (SEPA should be relatively cheap).

Just to report back what happened....
1. I sent my mobile number via PM to OP
2. Within a few minutes, I received an SMS with a link, a PIN code and amount sent
3. The link leads me to a Coinkite voucher
4. At first, I was under the impression that I need to create a Coinkite account to claim the BTC
5. In fact, you don't really need an account, as the BTC can also be transferred to any BTC public address
6. Using the PIN code, I was able to transfer the BTC to a new public address without much hassle.
7. All in all, a very pleasant experience, and thanks to the OP for this test / experiment.

There will always be ups and downs with all currencies, same with bitcoin. If you look up a chart of SA Rand, you'll see that is was at the current level in the beginning of 2009, rose over 50% in two years, then decline for another 2 years back to the current level. 
@_date: 2013-05-23 09:38:55
may be your UK site can also accept bitcoin??
@_date: 2013-05-23 09:54:37
your friend must have registered an email address with the blockchain wallet. his identifier would be sent to that email address when the wallet was first created.
in any case, inputting "alias" when trying to log-in to the online wallet would cause an "Authorize log-in attempt" email sent from blockchain to the registered email. just click on the link in that email and alongside with the correct password, your friend should be able to gain access again.
