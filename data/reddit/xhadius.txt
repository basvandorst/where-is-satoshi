This attack vector has been used here quite often.

Nice page, guess I will try it later today.
Java was never a friend of mine :)
@_date: 2014-11-27 06:11:55

God damn it. I just deleted the 2FA key of the Authy App...

Didn't contribute money 'till now, but therefor I helped translating into German at:
 Keep in mind, you don't just have to spend money to help.
There are many other ways to contribute into a project.

Do I even want to know how much this is...? :)
@_date: 2014-11-06 05:19:30
I was going to give it some revisions, just to make sure the words translated are also in the specific context.

*cough* @_date: 2014-11-25 05:28:23
It took me way to long to realize...
@_date: 2014-12-25 07:10:22
*whispers* Maybe he won't notice, that I'm way over 500 :D
@_date: 2014-12-12 10:40:50
So many downvotes on obvious sarcasm.

Sad that they only made it Touch ID compatible.
@_date: 2015-01-29 13:22:14
Well. How can I confirm, that the adress shown in the smartphone is the one I'm signing my transaction to?

@_date: 2015-03-17 21:41:00
Wish I could eventually log in at all right now.
Am I the only one having the "Could not connect to Circle at this time"-Error?
@_date: 2015-03-17 16:26:42
Yeah, let's just open up some random "setup.exe" as administrator...

//Edit: Uhh, just noticed that even the "PrimeDice3 Hash Cracker.exe" is infected with the same shit.
It's always nice to test out Skid-Bullshit on a VM.
