A waged person is a laborer with variable pay who draws on the basis of hours spent.
A salaried person is a skilled employee with fixed pay who draws on the basis of value added.

I'm in no rat race - and the recent influx of investment activity has made my sector boom.


Where did you draw that from? Do you know anybody in the 1%? They don't earn wages. You're likely referring to net worth, income or some other statistic that doesn't regard waged workers. A statistics class could teach you how silly averages are.


For whom? You and I it seems. Production means nothing if its fruits are not well divided. Before 1969, GDP/c and median household income had a strong correlation. Since then, the correlation has slowly but surely waned. It isn't a purely political issue either - it will be a driving acceleration of the next market collapse.

What are you talking about? In America at least, worker wage gains have just barely kept up with inflation in recent years and real wage growth has actually been falling for decades.

Refer to my original comment:


Looks like we agree on that one.


Not sure how that combats my point. If the internet led to the inequality of wealth gain over time in the US then so be it.


Just want to point out to you that an income of 450k+ is mathematically top 1% in the US. So those Engineering Managers better be damn good, considering in real life they are lucky to nab a 200k salary.
Regardless, none of these positions would be waged. There are positions below them that wouldn't be waged.
This would be a good read for you:
