Same evidence that was not allowed to be brought up in court because of it's "irrelevance" to that case?

From your link "We find extremely difficult to believe the FBI would miss the opportunity to charge DPR of attempted murder, as it was the case in the Maryland indictment, if they had undercover agents or privileged witnesses in the front-row seats ready confirm DRP hired a hitman to kill someone. One could argue the alleged DPR, Ross Ulbricht, is already charged with attempted murder in Maryland which could be "enough" for the prosecution to which we would reply there are not enough charges for a high profile target like DPR. Moreover the FBI wouldn't conceal evidence of an attempted murder if they had been "hired" by the suspect to carry the hit. Once again, it is important to keep in mind that Ross Ulbricht is not charged of any murder attempt in the NY complaint."
Even your source disagrees with you... Does calling someone a shithead make you feel good or something? Defending people that are wrongly accused sure makes me feel good, so thanks for the opportunity!

In addition to the obvious arbitrage value, this concept applies to [Grid Energy Storage]( A lot of measures are taken to store and later use grid energy that would otherwise be wasted. The suggestion is that this energy can be used to mine, then the profits from mining can be used to fund energy creation elsewhere when needed.

I like that it says pay with bitpay instead of pay with bitcoin. It's very similar to having a pay with PayPal link. PayPal will process any credit card transaction; bitpay will process any bitcoin transaction. It recognizes the intermediate and allows them to be accountable.

Credit cards have advantages over bitcoin for merchants? The only advantages that I can think of are recurring payments and popularity.
High Fees.
Risk of losing payments via fraud.
Wait a week or so for the money to be available (to repurchase supplies).

It's just context, but generally you are correct. 'Bitcoin' is the idea (protocol), making it a proper noun of sorts (like a company). 'bitcoin' (token) in a sense is an object, making it a common noun.
But I say it's just context because both imply the same:
"Why don't we use bitcoin?" vs "Why don't we use Bitcoin?"
The token would not exist without the protocol, and the protocol would be useless without the token. So really when you talk about the protocol, the token is enclosed, and when you talk about the token, the protocol is assumed.
@_date: 2015-07-01 20:37:10
I didn't miss that, I mentioned it as "popularity."
The risk of fraud is considerably less with bitcoin. With a credit card the user hands the merchant all information needed to "pull" money from the credit card. This information can be used again time after time as long as the credit card is valid. Bitcoin uses a "push" mechanism to make payments where-in the user must authorize each payment via signing with a private key. You are correct in saying that the merchant accepts the risk, but wouldn't it be better to mitigate the risk itself?
@_date: 2015-07-01 22:05:55
I agree! Let's get there!

Maybe they are waiting for payment networks to be developed. It would make a lot more sense (both to the customer and Uber) to wait for payment networks for this application. The problem with having an Uber 'wallet' where you deposit funds (that are immediately converted to USD and stored as an available balance) is that you are paying up front for a service that you might not use. This deters customers and can be a pain on Uber's end to issue refunds for available balances.

I tried it out. Process was very smooth, I got the 5% discount as promised. The only thing that slowed me down was copying/pasting the bitcoin address/amount from the text over to my mobile wallet. It would be great if you guys used the bitcoin URI scheme described in BIP21. This way you send me a link that looks like bitcoin:175tWpb8K1S7NmH4Zx6rewF9WQrcZv245W?amount=20.3&amp;label=PurseMagic and I just tap the link to open a wallet with the correct address and amount ready to go. Sending in plain-text is still a good idea as some people might not have URI enabled mobile wallets.
Edit: looks like bitcoin URI's are generally not recognized within most texting apps. URL pointing to a payment page on Purse.io would work well.

Privacy isn't limited to what an individual chooses to hide or share. A big part of privacy is what is done with the information once it has been shared (or acquired), that is how it can be used. Data is aggregated, mined for patterns, and stored indefinitely. You mock privacy issues simply by suggesting an individual can control their own privacy.

They still are. That is to say their monetization still revolves around leveraging their customers' personal data. Which is precisely the issue. Don't mock privacy as it becomes increasingly important.

Satoshi is just a symbol now. We may still idolize the idea of him or her, but there is no individual to point to. Part of what we idolize is the selfless person that saw a need for change, developed a brilliant system for enacting that change, and took absolutely no credit or personal recognition for doing so. I think it's not only safe, but healthy to idolize these characteristics.

And then you had to flip on DPR and lie to your customers. Shitty situation you were put in, I guess dealing with the US government sucks.

Maybe you can sell the rights to the story in an attempt to make gox customers whole again. (This is of course just a suggestion... I'm really not trying to be tongue-in-cheek here.

I don't understand. I thought the randomness was needed to generate the private key itself. Is deterministic signatures simply an additional step to ensure security?

Idk man I could see all this data collection/ aggragation going the wrong way at some point. It is very powerful information and I don't think many users have the foresight to properly assess their comfort level. It may be old news and an old issue, but it's still an issue. Also why the fuck should we be forced to censor/ monitor what information we're leaking. IMO this slows down commerce ;)
@_date: 2015-02-12 17:03:29
The fork would be soft until the first block created above the current limit. If you increase the limit very gradually the soft fork will last a lot longer than if we just jump up to 20MB. It's harder to hit the range of 1MB to 1.00001MB than it is to hit 1MB to 20MB.

This would be great for a laundromat. Pay washer/dryer with bitcoin, washer/dryer pay for electric use and set aside a small percent for repairs/eventual replacement.

Perhaps entangled particles could be used as a seed function.
@_date: 2015-02-10 01:54:48
No, I'm suggesting using the entangled particles' physical properties as a seed function. Not as a means to communicate, but as a shared random function that can be used to generate the same seed at the same time in two locations. This seed can be combined with the hash of the last block to start the race of finding the next block. This way everyone starts at the same time (as opposed to bitcoin's current scheme that allows miners to start hashing as soon as they are aware of a new block). We could even have miners work off the hash a block from n-blocks ago, which would extend the reach, but decrease the security of recent blocks. 
That being said, all of this depends on being able to find a truly random function out of an entangled particle. But it has nothing to do with teleporting information or going back in time.

Don't forget, if we're holding the balance in BTC it should be held in a 2 of 3 multisig with the user holding 2 keys and payment processer (CoinJar) holding one. This way the user still maintains control of their coins and must approve each withdrawal.

The private key used to authorize the transaction can be used to 'sign' anything. This signature can be validated using the corresponding public key. If I wanted to claim these lost bitcoin all I would need to do is sign a message that says "My username is powellzer and on 3/15/2015 I lost .4498 bitcoin to my own stupidity" with the same private key that was used to send those .4498 bitcoin away.
A lot of wallets now include the ability to sign messages with the private keys that they manage. I would recommend Mycelium for the task.
@_date: 2015-02-10 01:58:53
I'd be in favor of a soft-ish fork where we very gradually raise the limit instead of jumping right up to 20mb. The jump to 20MB presents too much risk for double spends following the hard fork.
