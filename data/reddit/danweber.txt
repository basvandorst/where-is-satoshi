You are horribly naive.
When the government orders you to not do something, if you not not not do it you can't walk away free and tell the government "you didn't say simon says!"
The government orders people not to talk about things all the time.  It prohibits insider trading.  It prohibits all sorts of businesses from revealing information about individuals.  It prohibits prosecutors from saying certain things to the media.  Each and every one of these things can be reframed with "canaries."  
Whenever a nerd on the Internet thinks he has figured out a way to outsmart the law, he's actually already been beaten to the punch.

You don't know what the word "evidence" means. 


Trials aren't for finding out truth. No, stop, I know you are going to make a smart-ass remark, but stop and listen.
Trials aren't for finding out the truth.  Trials take part *after* the investigation, which is the truth-finding part of the process.
Trials are the step where the government attempts to deprive someone of life or liberty, and must prove that the accused did the alleged crimes to a jury of the accused's peers beyond a reasonable doubt, using only evidence that is deemed specifically relevant to those charges.  It's the final, formal step of the entire process.  There's no need to be stupid until then.

There is a large body of legal and philosophical theory that has already thought this situation through.
If I throw a very small rock at your head, such that it is unlikely to hurt you at all, but it turns out your skull is as thin as an eggshell and it collapses and cripples you, I am at fault.  Because I'm not supposed to throw rocks at you.  When I did that I committed a tort and accepted all the risks from my actions.
If I do something perfectly legal, like tell you that your son has died in a fire when I honestly think it has happened, and you go into grief and have a heart attack and die, I'm not at fault.  Yes, my passing on the news was a critical part of the chain, and if I hadn't told you maybe you wouldn't have died.  But repeating a news fact isn't a tort.
What Swartz was being threatened with wasn't any worse than millions of other people who have gone through our justice system have faced.

You have failed the basic understanding.  Just because person A's actions were a critical part of the chain of events leading to person B's harm doesn't mean person A is at fault.
They also weren't "outrageous fake charges."  The charges against Swartz exactly describe Swartz's behavior.  You can argue that those actions should be legal, but they aren't, and Swartz knew that. He took explicit action to hide his identity, include holding a bike helmet over his face like a mask.  There is a reason he didn't do this at Harvard where he had legitimate access to JSTOR.

As is, all they knew was that someone kept on evading every technical countermeasure they put in place, including physical intrusion.

Because of its finite supply. The number of USD should match the size of the US Economy, roughly. Otherwise you get a money crunch.
Even in the days of the gold standard, new gold was mined every year.


They can; the question is what this does to the market for Bitcoins. Maybe people only want to hold $100 in crypto-currencies, in which case introducing another means a smaller demand for Bitcoins.

If deflation is going on, people don't spend the currency. Just as you said above, they hoard it, so vendors don't even bother with it.
An appreciating currency is good if you are a currency speculator. It's not good if you are trying to get bitcoins to be accepted as a medium of exchange for transactions.
For people to use it to buy and sell goods and services, the ideal would be if bitcoins were stable in value (which would mean they would appreciate very slightly against the dollar each year).

From what I've learned, you should backup at least every 100 times you *send money*.
If all you do is receive money, you can do that indefinitely without needing new backups. Bitcoins aren't stored on your computer; they are stored on the network. Your computer contains the authentication keys.  You could store your hard drive in a safe-deposit box for 5 years, and as long as that was the only copy of your wallet.dat, when you pull it back out you would have access to any deposits made to it in the meantime.

The community can also react.  For example, the crook is storing several thousand bucks at this address: 
If miners refused to process transactions from that address, and sellers refused to accept payment from it, the crook would be stuck.
There are two big problems with this:
1. It's hard to make the community agree on anything. Tell them not to do this, and some people will go out of their way to help the guy out.
2. The number of addresses can grow rapidly.  However, the crook needs to do a network transaction for each one.  And miners refusing to accept bitcoins from this address would stop him from rolling it over into another account.

Yes, the problem of resolving an asynchronous transaction always exists, regardless of currency or payment method. Currency fluctuation, though, means that a deal both sides earnestly wish to start could change into a deal that one side definitely wishes to end by the time it's done.

However, it's not the only currency. It competes with many others.
The value of all Bitcoins will probably hold some real constant, and represent an ever-shrinking part of the world economy. And this is okay.  
One big spanner in the works: if Bitcoin proves it can be done, other crypto-currencies will follow. How will they impact the value of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2011-06-16 15:56:34
Yeah, I think "most wanted" is probably a better metaphor.  For example, the accused thief has a bunch here 
We know little else about him.  But if he tries to, say, redeem them on MtGox, MtGox then will have actual bank information.
The (alleged) victim probably needs to take active steps, like having a lawyer help him get an injunction against MtGox against redeeming against that chain.  There's a question of how much work this should put on MtGox if they resist.  Ideally they will voluntarily agree in order to help protect the BitCoin community, as long as the victim meets certain legal thresholds.

As I've said before, I can't do transactions with a currency that changes this much in a single day.
@_date: 2011-05-17 22:38:18
One thing with Bitcoins is that they aren't totally anonymous.  If I stole a million bitcoins, the cops could track me down when I did some transaction with a real-world vendor.
In some ways, this is a good thing.
@_date: 2011-06-09 22:04:24
Just how easy to you want it to be to accept Bitcoin?  It's really not that hard right now.  
What's the minimum skill level you are looking to support?  Someone needs to be able to download a library at the least.

Since Bitcoins will not be the only currency, they can maintain constant (or very slightly increasing) value without breaking the economy.

On the other hand, maybe MtGox is above average in competence.
You shouldn't evaluate security based on how bad the things are that slip through.

The people who have had their bitcoins stolen should really, seriously, be hiring lawyers, and having those lawyers subpoena the major exchanges to see if they've traded with those addresses.

Bitcoinpool has a security problem that I mailed them about. They fixed it but never responded, which seems about right for them.  
I got a little tired of the "YOU WILL BE BANNED IF YOU AREN'T GOOD ENOUGH" messages on their boards and moved to a friendlier place.

Make a "savings account" wallet.  Generate the keys, save the keys to a CD-ROM, print out the mime-encoded keys on paper, and put the CD-ROM and the paper in a safe deposit box.
Never send money from this wallet.  If it only receives money, the wallet will be valid forever.
@_date: 2011-05-10 19:52:19
The market doesn't have a first derivative.
Bitcoins *have gone up*. This is very different from bitcoins are currently going up.  Bitcoins could stay flat from here or rise from here or plummet from here.
I hear far too many people talk of momentum this way in markets. "Oh, I don't want to sell my stock, *it's doing so well.*" No, it **has** done well.
@_date: 2011-06-14 18:37:34
In either scenario, we would want to talk to the cops.
I dug up some of the links.  It looks like the crook has mixed up some old bitcoins, or moved them onto other people, because I found more than 25000:
10020 BTC: 
10000: 
5792 
5000 
2500 
12.5~

It's scary that in the bitcoin forums, you can get 4 upvotes for saying bitcoins "are not a real currency."
Oh, bitcoin is a super-awesome currency -- wait, not when it comes to taxes! Now it's all play money!
I'm convinced most of you people are still teenagers.

All that proves is that I sent something.
Asynchronous transactions always have problems, regardless of the payment method. I don't need to add a 50% currency variation to the mix.
A colleague of mine once bought a gold coin off of eBay while the price was going up.  The seller just refused to sell it because gold had appreciated during the course of the auction.

I can't sell stuff to people with a currency this volatile. I sell someone a book and mail it to them, while they put the Bitcoins into an escrow service. If the Bitcoins double in value by the time they get their book, they'll just refuse to confirm the order.

I guess that explains the lack of tx fees on the older blocks.  Was this change within the past few weeks?

Anyone can get taken by a conman, including the media.
