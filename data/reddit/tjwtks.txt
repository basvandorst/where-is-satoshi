They asked for payment before carrying out any work. Supposedly for hacking tools.
In my naivety I believed them.

He is a scammer!
 Michael Veksler does wallet recovery, but it's not him.
His name has been appropriated by the scammer at that email address.
I contacted both of them.
Michael Veksler has a website and does genuine wallet recovery.

Well as stupid as it sounds, there was some method in that madness. One of the guys I found did actually manage to trick the credit card company ledger into a negative balance for the whole limit. And I was able to transfer that money out to Coinbase.
There is elaborate back story that involves several scammers posing as hackers..One of which was and one who was good at social engineering and using my stupidity to his advantage.
Although I did question the whole madness of the techniques in my head at the time. Common sense evaded me. I was in a bad situation  and I was in way to deep to see sense. 
It was a complex web that I really don't feel I need to explain to morons like yourself.
As for me not understanding or deserving Bitcoin! As though your some almighty being who deserves to have Bitcoin above any other person.
I understand the basics of Bitcoin and I fully appreciate it's significance as an invention for the good of humanity in this current financial Armageddon were about to face! Good luck surviving that one, if you live in the US!
Get a life and stop picking on people who have made life changing mistakes you heartless cunt!

It wasn't an investment scam. Weirdly, I was actually trying to clear debts. The scammers persuaded me to take out more debt and max out credit cards, apply for loans etc. Massive social engineering and conning over months. Most of the money wasn't mine. 
So don't go presuming!
