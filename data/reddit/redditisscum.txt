I am more concerned about a massive decline in the spending of bitcoins.  The IRS is trying to say it is a digital stock and this is much worse than most are willing to admit right now.  How do you expect btc to survive as a long term investment if it has lost its appeal as a currency? Kill the brain and the body dies with it.

btc can be used for those purposes (I'm not judging :^]) but to do this requires an understanding of IT security, cryptography, law, and finance...bitcoin isn't anymore of a guilty party than USD is and it is actually LESS anonymous than USD unless you understand internet anonymity.
