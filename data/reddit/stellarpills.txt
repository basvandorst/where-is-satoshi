Hmm I could swing someth for XP I guess. I'm just trying to understand the wallet systems and how the actual trading works. Understanding strategy buying/selling its still a bit confusing but its interesting.

Ok so I've got it but I'm curious on how to actually send it to someone? I mean I don't know anyone who even cares about bitcoin, personally . And the faucet gave me 9k+ test coin. It's awesome I'm actually getting the feel for the interface and thank you infinitely more for showing me this.

There's just not enough people who understand or care about bitcoin or related crypto currencies. Just too ahead of its time. This ship will sink. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 01:02:56
What army do you plan on using to fight back with? No one cares about bitcoin. I've talked to people who watch the news Constantly and they still have zero knowledge of what bitcoin is or what it's used for. if you think people or politicians are going to support something that most people don't even understand just so the few who DO understand what it is, can line their Pockets nonstop without batting an eye. You live in a dream land. We all knew what this was, Just a quick buck here and there for a little bit of an investment. No one had to work for this shit no one broke their backs for bitcoin, Aka "mining" bs.

I need to hop on the bitcoin train. just seems a little intimidating, considering how lost I get while reading all that goes into it.
