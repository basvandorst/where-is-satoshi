I would say diversify not only to crypto but also silver, gold, would not go for share holds because in next 2 years it is like 90% there will be crush. I get you understand risk, I think you understand factors. 
Anyway gl sir.

I study economy and i believe in btc and i have no idea why gov coudn't control minimum wages if it was paid in btc. The gov is simply telling companies the minimum amount of money they have to pay to their employees, it doesn't matter if it is in cuntry's currency, forein or cryopto; if they dont gov gives sanctions on that employer who doesn't pay enough. The expenses  employer is taking have to be avinable to gov anyways for example for tax information and it goes on...

man, this isn't always 'just about money', that simplifies that a lot and imo is very disrespectful for people who are losing their lives for other so they can have better future.

Slow adoption is the key, we don't need revolution.  What's more important it will increase volume which is way more important then stupid price, because it will that it is used by people (that btc is useful). If btc is now just to keep high price then fuck it
