Starting to wonder if I should sell at 1M or still hold ??
We're going fast. :-P

Congrats I guess.
It already almost doubled since he sold.

How is bitcoin going to deal with even wider adoption ?
Transactions are already slow and too expensive, the blockchain is going to be Terabytes ?

why ?
I'm unable to login since hours from a PC, unable to transfer funds from the APP... sucks.

They're not "back to supporting bitcoin".
Misleading title.

I still have a long way to go.
I'm in Switzerland and house prices vary from ~1'000'000$ to infinity :-(
There's some advantages living in a poorer country.

...and drugs.
How rich are Darknet drug dealers by now ??

How is it going to work with such high fees on transactions ?
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:55:22
They practice "fiscal optimization" since decades, They'll find a way. Don't worry.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:26:56
Fees : 200% up

I remember when I first read about bitcoin... it wasn't worth a $ and people on forums were like : "in a few years we're all going to be millionaires."
Some of those fuckers are billionaires by now...

I managed to make it work using another ISP (hotspot with my phone) ...

Remembering the story of a guy buying a pizza 10k bitcoins... one of the early transactions.
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:20:19
People that bought at 3 cents sold at 10$ long ago.
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:02:58
It will reach 1M...

One of the mandatory selling-points for a currency is its stability.
Bitcoin is not stable - at all.
